[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500]
Oh!

[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.360]
Sportzee 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.760]
Oh, right.

[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.520]
You talked to Neil called 567-0560 toll free for date and grammar or pound 560 on your cell

[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.740]
ball.

[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.560]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not necessarily

[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.440]
reflect those of WQAM, easily read acquisitions or the easily broadcast group.

[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.640]
Now, Neil Rogers on sports radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.560]
You know, fat rich reminds me of my mother.

[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.180]
In theaters now, from the director of Leaver to Beaver and the producer of The Spy, who

[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.640]
shagged me, it's The Spy, who shagged Beaver.

[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.000]
Who on make you hooney?

[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.560]
Yeah, I know that feeling.

[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.220]
Who on make you hooney baby?

[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.280]
Yeah, who on?

[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.380]
Yeah, I guess you're right.

[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.820]
Who?

[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.160]
Who's a baby?

[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.820]
Joey Shag now or Joey Shag 90?

[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.240]
I've got the breakfast dishes never seen a deal.

[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.420]
The Spy, who shagged me?

[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.800]
I'm the Bieber.

[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.240]
You're wearing some things out of you.

[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.220]
Oh, be.

[00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.060]
Hey, when your dad sees this, it's back to the closer wagon for you.

[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.220]
Yeah, baby.

[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.480]
Oh, the worst news I've ever heard in my life.

[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.320]
And especially Donnie B likes him so you know he's an old hack.

[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.740]
You know, Donnie B's not a bad guy, but he's got the worst taste in everything.

[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.000]
Everything.

[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.100]
Fuck Christina Moore was a talent.

[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.060]
And I've been taking leak about 10 minutes ago and there's Donnie B at the urinal.

[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.440]
Thank God there's a divider in there, but nevertheless.

[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.680]
And he says, well, what do you think about Jigs?

[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.960]
I said he's an old hack.

[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.120]
He's terminally boring.

[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.780]
Oh, I grew up with him with the islanders.

[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.680]
Him and Eddie Westfall.

[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.580]
And I went, oh, yeah.

[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.760]
Oh, my God.

[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.120]
How could this be?

[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.840]
Well, it's easy to tell you how it could be.

[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.140]
And that's because the first of all, Bill Torrey has this insetuous relationship with Jigs

[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.460]
going back to his islander days.

[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.660]
And secondly, generally speaking, the Wayne and the Wayne High Pingo organization, even

[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.280]
though Dean Jordan isn't here anymore, they're into old hacks.

[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.660]
That's generally speaking what they've been bringing in with the acceptance of course

[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.080]
of my close best personal friend, Jeff Rimmer.

[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.920]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.500]
Now, don't you start in with Rimmer, okay?

[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.180]
Who I happen to be taking the dinner tonight at a very expensive restaurant, which I won't

[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.520]
mention until tomorrow, but nevertheless.

[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.860]
Are you going to start in on him again?

[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.600]
George?

[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.980]
Yes, you are.

[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.520]
Oh, so before we get back to Jigs McDonald, here's a mobile and cross-n-cheeds and do the

[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.760]
phone.

[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.220]
Say, it doesn't.

[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.540]
It's a good thing we did a little test there.

[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.740]
I don't want to take calls yet anyway, but it's a good thing.

[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.680]
Too bad you're out.

[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.560]
Whoever called on the mobile.

[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.460]
Jordan reset the phone.

[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.180]
Okay, here we go.

[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.480]
Phone reset time.

[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.100]
Got me to QAN or incompetent.

[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.760]
Beasley sucked.

[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.500]
Reckless the public.

[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.900]
And we got to go through this every day just to try to put a few calls on here.

[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.500]
Okay, before we get back to Jigs McDonald and all these other things, all of these

[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.860]
things.

[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.300]
And even before I get into that, I've got to pre-imp that.

[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.660]
We own apology.

[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.960]
I say we, not me.

[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.740]
And thanks by the way to the caller who at least tried, I wish we would have had more

[00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.020]
callers yesterday to alert the people out there.

[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.160]
See, I've told you for a year and a half now that if you listen to this radio station,

[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.260]
unless you're a professional sports nerd and there's some information you want, unless

[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.340]
it's on Nischel and I can get it off the TV set here, I'll see an end or something,

[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.780]
you're not going to find out about it.

[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.640]
They could be poisoning the water at home state and this would be the last place you'd

[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.140]
find out about it.

[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.680]
Driving home yesterday up the return plane, remember we had the call from the one guy?

[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.700]
Did you see it?

[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.880]
No, I didn't.

[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.540]
I don't go that way.

[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.700]
Oh, the traffic was backed up for miles.

[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.520]
There was a wreck.

[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.960]
Somebody had actually gone through the median.

[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.260]
And there's just a mess, a nightmarish mess.

[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.840]
I would say South of Hollywood Boulevard exit.

[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.960]
And the traffic was backed up well beyond Griffin Road coming southbound.

[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.560]
And of course, luckily I'm going northbound and I'm thinking to myself and they've got

[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.760]
it.

[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.240]
The traffic blocked off and they're making them extra in the Hollywood Boulevard.

[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.600]
But why are they letting people on north of there?

[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.220]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.540]
Why are they letting people get on here so they can get locked up?

[00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.040]
I mean, some of you people out there just must be psychotic at this point.

[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.300]
I've never seen it like that anywhere.

[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.720]
Backed up for miles.

[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.740]
And did we really have anything on it on this radio station?

[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.980]
No.

[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.160]
How about our crack traffic people that we must have some kind of a deal with, even though

[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.660]
they don't work here between 10 and 2.

[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.660]
But you would think that they might have alerted us yesterday.

[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.120]
You traffic people suck.

[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.480]
Okay?

[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.800]
Whatever service we got, which they're all the same in this town because they're all full

[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.600]
of crack and they're all way behind the time.

[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.720]
And every time they tell you there's a wreck, you know, you drive through there and you

[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.280]
say, what wreck?

[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.520]
Because it was cleaned up a half an hour.

[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.560]
That's how far behind they are because they're probably reading it out of a newspaper

[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.060]
somewhere.

[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.160]
But that we apologize profusely on behalf of the ineptitude of this radio station and

[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.680]
our traffic service who are but how they are for not alerting you yesterday to a mess.

[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.360]
I actually felt bad about it.

[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.040]
Do you believe that?

[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.440]
No.

[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.880]
No, I did.

[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.800]
I felt guilty.

[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.920]
I felt the end and was stuck an hour and a half in it.

[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.140]
Yeah.

[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.600]
Sort of very bad.

[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.020]
And we should have been on here repeatedly instead of just that one guy that called, we

[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.780]
should have been repeatedly saying, stay off that southbound turnpike.

[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.260]
If you do anything, just get the hell out of there and don't go anywhere near there.

[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.660]
Did we do that?

[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.080]
No.

[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.660]
No, because, and how come nobody else called except that one guy?

[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.100]
Probably afraid to run their battery down, probably to unplug their cell phones and just,

[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.640]
you know, man, how long was she stuck?

[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.280]
Hour and a half.

[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.880]
Hour and a half in that mess.

[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.600]
How do you like that?

[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.740]
Which meant we only got to see her for five minutes.

[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.060]
And by the way, before I forget her birthday is tomorrow, happy birthday, Shannon.

[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.860]
Well, I'll do it today and again tomorrow, but I might forget.

[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.460]
Although I'm sure you won't allow me to forget.

[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.120]
So here is the worst mother story in the history of the human race.

[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.720]
So George and I had this contest.

[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.760]
It's an ongoing contest.

[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.900]
He insists that his mother is the most relentless bitch of all time.

[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260]
And I tell him, you're not even in the contest.

[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.220]
You're not even in the running.

[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.400]
So anyway, I told you about the story about my TV set.

[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.040]
And I also want to tell you that the attached, ultra vision, I'm becoming more attached

[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.480]
to it by the minute I've never seen a picture like that in my life.

[00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.780]
Now that I have adjusted right.

[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.760]
So the guy that called and told me it's not in the same league with a Sony XPR, you're right.

[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.460]
It's much better.

[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.840]
The picture is unbelievable.

[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.320]
I love it.

[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.000]
I'm squeezing it and they have TV too.

[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.500]
But they did come from a part to repair the Sony XPR, which is still a hell of a good set

[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.280]
and sitting in another room right now.

[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.660]
And so my mother was kind enough to come to my house and TV said while the repairman was coming

[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.780]
since they were coming between noon and four.

[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.780]
All the wood had been a good idea to take off from work because the TV repairman was coming

[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.000]
but it's a little cheesy to do.

[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.720]
Don't you think?

[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.120]
So she's a house sitting.

[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.020]
And then of course since I usually go to my mother's house on Wednesdays lately for lunch,

[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.220]
it was Wednesday yesterday.

[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.020]
I said you can make lunch in my house and we'll eat there and then you can get your ass

[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.440]
out of there.

[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.760]
So I get home yesterday at 232 and she says, oh, Pat Rich just got off the phone.

[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.780]
He just called to see if you're going to the track tonight.

[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.800]
And yes, I was going so I didn't need to call him back.

[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.160]
Now keep that in mind for later in the story.

[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.880]
Now the TV guys already been there.

[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.120]
It turned out it wasn't the picture tube hadn't gone out or any of the whatever the tubes

[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.300]
are.

[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.540]
It was that some things inside the set were had gotten disconnected and it looks fine.

[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.380]
Fixed the thing.

[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.100]
Thank you very much by the way, repairman from Mark.

[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.420]
It was also a big groupie.

[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.840]
So we sit down and we're having lunch and out of nowhere in the middle of all the other

[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.280]
nagging that goes on that I'm used to that never it never ends never stop.

[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.540]
Why don't you fix that door?

[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.500]
Why don't you do that?

[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.960]
You know that that just never stops on that that's that's small stuff.

[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.000]
So in the middle of having lunch, I found a snickers wrapper.

[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.500]
Are you crazy?

[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.060]
What are you eating crap like that for?

[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.140]
Now, first of all, she doesn't know that I ate it.

[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.480]
It could have been John who's got this hysterical psychosis for candy.

[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.420]
Although I think snickers is out of his league.

[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.740]
He's usually into something more exotic like parodena and stuff like that.

[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.300]
But nevertheless, it could have been him that ate it or anybody else that stopped by

[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.660]
the house could have been bunch of other people.

[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.900]
But she's right, I ate it and I'm not going to deny it.

[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.420]
And I said there were since he's fat or fat, I held a lot of fat or nigh am anyway.

[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.000]
I said, you were good one to talk addicted to chocolate number one.

[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.360]
And she's saying that she's sitting there drinking ginger ale with sugar in it.

[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.040]
Remember that comment a couple of weeks ago when I was talking about I like sugar.

[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.420]
Yeah, but I'm diabetic, ma.

[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.580]
Stop force feeding it on me.

[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.680]
She likes sugar and she's giving me a lecture.

[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.200]
So I said, you're not eating all this crap all the time?

[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.940]
Well, but I don't pretend to be on a diet.

[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.140]
I said, who wouldn't I say was in a diet?

[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.260]
Have I said I'm on a diet anytime recently?

[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:20.540]
No.

[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.940]
I do the ethkins from about two, three hours a day after I wake up.

[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.940]
So anyway, keep that in mind.

[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.680]
Now fat rich had just called only seconds before I came in.

[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.880]
I go to the track last night.

[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.540]
I don't think I'm prepared to tell this.

[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.420]
You're not going to believe this.

[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.700]
Now, she doesn't know fat rich from that cup.

[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.020]
You got sitting over there on a counter.

[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.900]
She just knows him barely whether she's ever spoken in.

[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.820]
I guess before when I've been on vacation, she's been in the house.

[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.100]
He's called in other words over the phone.

[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.840]
She knows him about as much as you know somebody passing in the night.

[00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.240]
So he tells me at the track last night that he calls there looking for me to say if you're

[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.900]
not going to show up call me because I'm going to be at the track tonight at center

[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.340]
and so on.

[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.800]
She says, you know, I was rummaging to the garbage and I found a snickers wrapper.

[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:11.940]
How do you like that?

[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.260]
That's the kind of lunatic I got.

[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.000]
She was rummaging through my garbage and found this snickers wrapper.

[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.780]
What was she hoping to find?

[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.220]
I don't know, but I'm going to tell you one thing.

[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.820]
Next time she's there, I'm going to make sure that there are a lot of other things

[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:28.460]
that she'll find.

[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.700]
Things that ordinarily wouldn't be in the house, but I'll make sure I can find them

[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.060]
somewhere.

[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.040]
Oh, even better than that.

[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:44.820]
She was rummaging through my garbage and found a snickers candy bar wrapper and she's telling

[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.520]
this to somebody that she doesn't even really know.

[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.860]
It would be like if somebody called and it was a wrong number.

[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.040]
Oh, by the way, before you go, my son is near Rogers and that was rummaging through

[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.140]
the garbage and I found a snickers candy bar wrapper.

[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.240]
You see what an asshole he is?

[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.660]
And this is also on the day, by the way, that I left her a nice check that I give her

[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:09.120]
every month and the check for the maintenance fee on the condo that I bought for her and

[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.080]
the car that I bought for her cash that she drives home in.

[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.900]
Left the check there on the counter for her also.

[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.360]
If they just mentioned that in passing, which he did thank me for, you understand, but

[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.800]
she was rummaging through my garbage.

[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.960]
So anyway, is there any contest anymore, George?

[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.520]
I don't think my mom has ever rummaged through the garbage.

[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.000]
Okay, but she does tell me that the stranger is every horrible thing in her garbage.

[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.640]
10 times 10 at 5.60 WQM if you're...

[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.180]
Hey, deal!

[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.220]
Fuck you!

[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.140]
Feeling sexy?

[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:39.660]
Feeling kinky?

[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:40.760]
Feeling old?

[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.200]
Been coming to Fredericks and Hollywood?

[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.100]
Florida.

[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.780]
Retirement haven to the elderly.

[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.820]
So you wear a plastic hair bonnet when it's sunny out and a fur coat during the summer?

[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.600]
Big deal!

[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.180]
That doesn't mean you can't done some crotchless panties in a barbed wire broth tonight.

[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.880]
Honey, look at these rubber panties, you'd look great in these.

[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.760]
Now grandma, check out this G-string and see through all their top combination.

[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.260]
What?

[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.360]
Oh, that is nice, dear.

[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.760]
I didn't see myself really getting into that little number.

[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.380]
Can't you?

[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.700]
Bring the husband, bring your family, bring your bed nurse, and come into Fredericks and

[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.060]
Hollywood.

[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:15.700]
Florida.

[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.120]
Look for one in the retirement community near you.

[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:18.620]
Oh!

[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.400]
That's 15 to 5.50 WQM.

[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.100]
James McDonald, a joint panties on the radio, and it's amazing to me that for some reason

[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.160]
this story shows up first in the Palm Beach Post.

[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.340]
Brian Biggame, Palm Beach Post-Frider, which I have the first page of it, but nobody

[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.500]
bothered to give me the second page, which is interesting.

[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.620]
But thanks for somebody sending me the first page of copy of over here.

[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.100]
What about the second page of it?

[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.720]
Not that I really need to rest because I know James McDonald like the back of your ass.

[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.680]
Not a bad guy.

[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.020]
He's a good guy like I said he once gave me a plug on his Fox National Tele-Regional.

[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.480]
There were like five people watching, really.

[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.900]
But he still gave me a plug for being a hockey maven here in South Florida and promoting

[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.080]
the Panthers when he was doing a Panther game on Fox.

[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.140]
So I should be very nice to James, but the fact is I don't operate that way.

[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.640]
This is not personal.

[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.540]
This is business.

[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.640]
And the fact is he's an old, funny, dirty, who was chased out throttles after one year.

[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:11.900]
As I predicted.

[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.100]
James McDonald, a member of the hockey hall of fame, a broadcast three of the islanders,

[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.680]
four standard cup championships in the early 1980s.

[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.920]
Will we name the Florida Panthers radio play by playboys today?

[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.580]
Oh, it says in the, uh, in the Palm Beach post.

[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.500]
For some reason, our other papers here in Dayton, Broward missed this story.

[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.300]
How do you like that?

[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.340]
As usual, they're too busy making stuff up and hyperventilating about, you know, the lawsuits

[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.660]
with this one and that one and radio a bathroom, which ain't even on the area yet.

[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.480]
McDonald, a part-time resident of Hutchinson Island in Martin County replaces Chris Moore,

[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.060]
who resigned last spring to accept an offer from ESPN.

[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.860]
Now, I will say this, we're definitely upgrading.

[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.380]
Of course, they could have brought in a dead monkey and we'd have been upgrading from

[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.800]
Christine and Moore, but nevertheless.

[00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.520]
And I know Geldy's upset.

[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.100]
He was in here.

[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.580]
We had a little chat this morning because he wanted the job.

[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.520]
I was pushing him to do it because, you know, that's what they should do.

[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.740]
It's a relatively new team.

[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.460]
They've only been in existence six years.

[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.300]
Instead of bringing in another tired old hack, bringing somebody new, somebody young, somebody

[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.920]
who knows the game, somebody who's got great enthusiasm, somebody who's got a voice that,

[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.620]
you know, maybe bad for talk shows, but still would be good for hockey.

[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.320]
And, do they do it?

[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.780]
No, they bring in this guy because, again, Bill Tories got an incestuous relationship.

[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.280]
Most of the broadcasters that have been hired in the sports teams down here have, like, built

[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:32.660]
them for.

[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.260]
There's a classic example for it.

[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.060]
Why?

[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.660]
Because Dean Jordan knew him from Back at Penn State.

[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.380]
So they had this incestuous suckoverly and not that Zimper is bad.

[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.320]
He's not a bad guy.

[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.420]
He's got a, yeah, but he's got that staccato like out of a computer and like Hank said

[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.320]
the other day, nobody knows who he is.

[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.860]
If you held a gun, the 50 people had a day land right now and you said, name me the play-by-play-an-answer

[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.380]
for the dolphins.

[00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.020]
They couldn't do it.

[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.100]
They'd all go, yeah.

[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.480]
And it's all, yeah, Jim Manditz.

[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.780]
No, he does the color around the games.

[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.280]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:04.740]
Oh, right.

[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.620]
It's not a movie or a two, by the way.

[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.220]
Hank is on vacation again.

[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.500]
Does that do the deal?

[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:08.800]
Uh-huh.

[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.300]
Today and tomorrow, you think I get a lot of vacation time.

[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.600]
You came back to the few shows and said, that's it.

[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.180]
I'm out of here.

[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.020]
Nice going, Hemp, a Humper.

[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:16.720]
Hemper.

[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.520]
But, uh, so, you know, they bring this guy in who's an old hack.

[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.500]
60 years old.

[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.360]
Again, is hockey broadcasting with the L.A.

[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.440]
Kings in 1967.

[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.860]
We've gone to the expansion flames in 1972.

[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.680]
And then of course, he was hired by Islanders GM, built Torrey.

[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.800]
And then he went on to, uh, after he got candy there.

[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.780]
I mean, after he, uh, moved out of that spot, he kind of wandered around.

[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.880]
Did some, uh, feeling weakened the stuff for Fox a few games there.

[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.200]
And then he wound up, uh, two years ago in Toronto.

[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.820]
And at the time, I told certain people in the business that he'll never last at all there.

[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.140]
They'll, they'll chase his ass out of town because Toronto, of course,

[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:02.660]
being a real hockey city where they've had some of the greatest hockey broadcasts

[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.660]
and did they know one year he was gone.

[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:10.080]
They were carving him an ass and they Toronto papers were unlike here where they suck everybody's ass.

[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.680]
See, that's the problem with his town.

[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.080]
Why can't we have some people who write columns about stuff?

[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:22.460]
Why can't we have somebody instead of these kids, these children, these stringers who really write,

[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.580]
even if it's scathing stuff, even if they ripped me an ass, whoever it was, something,

[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:32.040]
as opposed to about maybe once every six months, it'll blink it to a reactor when something major gigantic

[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.040]
that they can't evade and avoid happens.

[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.640]
Every other major market, they've got people that write really insightful stuff about TV

[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.720]
and even about radio.

[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.360]
I hate to break the news to you here, guys.

[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.680]
Even about radio.

[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.860]
Even as weak of a radio market as this is.

[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.020]
But no, nobody here is really a, there's just, really having an opinion one way or the other.

[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.480]
All they do is just, uh, report it and that's it.

[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.400]
Separate Jack ass, of course, who helps me fall on our ass because we hate each other like boys

[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.540]
and he works for the Harold.

[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.720]
So the Panther organization continues to go the old and funny-duty way with people like this.

[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.160]
And it is a step up from Christine and Moron and since most of the games are on television anyway,

[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.160]
not so many people will be listening to Jigsaw, maybe it doesn't make any difference.

[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.440]
And I wish him all the best in the world because he'll need it.

[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.160]
Toronto, they actually, they literally boot his ass out of town.

[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.580]
Is it get this old, funny-duty man out of here?

[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.840]
Bring Joel Bowen back on not just on radio, we want him on TV during the weeknight games.

[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.460]
They said, okay, okay, stop it, a bull crap already, okay?

[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.740]
Just leave us alone. Goodbye, Jigs. Good luck to you.

[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.660]
And now he winds up here.

[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:37.600]
The rejects.

[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.560]
Like Christine and Moron, reject even a new Jersey.

[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.880]
When you get rejected in New Jersey,

[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.780]
that's the ultimate slap in the face and then they bring him here.

[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.240]
So there you go.

[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.640]
Not that anybody will care about that because just like Donnie V,

[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.500]
nobody here's got any clue about sports casters which I said yesterday.

[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.640]
Why did I even bring that up with Hank the day before?

[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.540]
It was the point.

[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.460]
Nobody here knows anything about these people.

[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.940]
Because these people are in La La Land here.

[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.980]
Now where's that thing about the cigars?

[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.840]
The footy is going to be, the footy will be gloating about this.

[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.200]
Wait till he finds out about this.

[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.500]
The Federal Trade Commission,

[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.040]
as part of this ongoing Goody Tushu's America that you live in,

[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:23.160]
ask Congress on Wednesday to mandate new health warnings on cigar labels

[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.520]
and advertising to dispel the notion that cigars are a safer alternative to cigarettes.

[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.780]
The FTC issued recommendations with three specific health warning labels

[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:36.180]
and also urged a ban on television and radio cigar advertising.

[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.840]
So I think footy was right.

[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.640]
If we plan on surviving based on some little mom and pop cigars doors here,

[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.720]
on those $10 spots, we're in big trouble.

[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.780]
Right footy?

[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.340]
You asshole.

[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.140]
Regular cigar smokers are at risk of mouth and throat cancer.

[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.380]
Similar to that of cigarette smokers said FTC chairman Robert Petosky.

[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:03.340]
There may be people under the misimpression that if they switch to cigars, they're in safe harbors.

[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.720]
How about if we just stop breathing?

[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.080]
You know, the air is loaded with all these pollutants.

[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.540]
How about if we just stop breathing and certainly stop eating

[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.780]
because our food is filled with all kinds of cancer causing agents?

[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.460]
I think we ought to stop allowing advertising for food.

[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.560]
Because most of it is killing us.

[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.400]
Won't that be next?

[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.660]
Let's stop all food advertising.

[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.020]
If they're going to be consistent,

[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.640]
let's rob with advertising cigarettes.

[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.660]
Winsden tastes good like a cigarette like a cancer stick should.

[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.600]
Let's rob with that.

[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.140]
I like the moral role, man.

[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.860]
Little too macho for me, but nevertheless,

[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.480]
that's not that cowboy thing.

[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.520]
What was wrong with him, or a poor man?

[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.120]
That was fun.

[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.640]
I got the big scull and crossbones on air.

[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.060]
Caught you in the surgeon general says you're going to die if you get near this stuff.

[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.720]
But pick your poison.

[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.800]
Stop trying to be goody-to-shoes and stop putting on his phony egg.

[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.460]
Look at all the drugs that the FDA has approved that have killed people.

[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.680]
How about FinFen?

[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.680]
Forget about going back to Thalidomide and all the other ones.

[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.680]
How about FinFen?

[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.260]
Oh, maybe we're in a mistake.

[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.520]
We acted too hastily here.

[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.300]
It happens all the time.

[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.080]
Your government in action.

[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.700]
So now we've got to have, that's right.

[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.740]
They have the power to require labels on its own,

[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.140]
but often instead to refer its recommendation to Congress.

[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.620]
Most of our boxes already include a label required under a settlement of a California court case,

[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.440]
which says the product contains or produces chemicals known to the state of California

[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.180]
to cause cancer and birth defects and other reproductive harm.

[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:46.980]
But they want more strongly-worded warnings, such as warning regular cigars smoking can cause cancers of the mouth and throat,

[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.180]
even if you've not inhaled.

[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.760]
Why do we have warnings on the food that we eat that they can cause cancer?

[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.280]
Even if we don't inhale, I've never seen any.

[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:55.520]
No.

[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.220]
Or that can cause fat.

[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.840]
Yeah, cause you to get fat and a heart attack and strokes and diabetes and die a premature death and go...

[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.400]
Oh, I see.

[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.220]
...apquagol your arteries.

[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.700]
Do we have warnings about that?

[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:05.980]
No.

[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.560]
Let's just have warnings on everything.

[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:14.200]
Because basically what the government is really saying in their hypocritical way is that we're all a bunch of siblings and we can't make our own choices.

[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:22.260]
Just like with marijuana, they've determined that it's an evil substance that's certainly a gateway to all these other evil things,

[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:29.120]
just like drinking a glass of mogan-David wine on Passover will certainly make you a chronic alcoholic and a member of AA for life.

[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.020]
They've decided that.

[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.680]
See, I don't know about you, but I don't want a government that's going to decide everything I put in my mouth.

[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.660]
Oh gee, that was a bad choice of words, wasn't it?

[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.420]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:39.920]
Oh, yeah.

[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.440]
They're going to decide what we're going to eat, what we're going to watch, what we're going to think, what we're going to smoke.

[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.880]
I like a good cigar, okay?

[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.040]
And whether we have a sponsor or not, as we happen to know, a damn good one.

[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.680]
But even if we didn't, I don't give a crap.

[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.600]
I still occasionally like a good cigar, whether my mother likes it or not.

[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.460]
And by the way, my $135.00 is a pompadopark last night.

[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.280]
That's another thing she's giving me a lecture on.

[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.140]
Oh, you don't have to go on the air and tell people how much you lost at the track.

[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.580]
Big gambler, Neil Rogers, I won $35 at pompadopark last night.

[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:08.960]
Oh!

[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.720]
There you go, ma.

[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.900]
And quit rummaging through my goddamn garbage.

[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.840]
What kind of seriously?

[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.260]
I hate to go back to that again.

[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.780]
I might just dwell on this for four hours.

[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:25.960]
What kind of a person tells a virtual stranger, much less anybody else, that she was rummaging through my garbage,

[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.680]
and found a snickers bar wrapper.

[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.840]
How do you like that?

[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:32.760]
Oh!

[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:33.120]

[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:34.620]
Wow.

[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.100]
At least your mom can cook.

[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.460]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.200]
Never had an edible meal for you.

[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.520]
You know something, doesn't make any difference.

[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.760]
You're not missing for good food, okay?

[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:44.980]
Not anymore.

[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:45.340]
Yeah.

[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:53.220]
I mean, if cooking is a compensation, cooking a good meal is a compensation for incessant,

[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:59.720]
nattering, nagging, and doing unacceptable things like scouring through my garbage.

[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.340]
And of course, I can just imagine all these times we've gone on vacation, and she's there babysitting the dogs.

[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:13.700]
I can imagine there is anything in that house that hasn't had her fine finger on it, in it, around it, through it, underneath it, etc.

[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:14.980]
Which is great.

[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.860]
I'm going to start leaving all kinds of wild pornography around.

[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.200]
I got some used condoms.

[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.000]
Let's get some of those.

[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.420]
Let's have Elle Gulstein send us every pornographic thing that he ever had possession of his life.

[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.420]
And then he starts to scan.

[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.340]
And she'll probably like it.

[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.040]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:28.560]
Oh!

[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.120]
How now can I come over and watch the dogs again this weekend?

[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:33.700]
Hmm.

[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.200]
She was going through my garbage.

[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.160]
As long as I live, this is one I'll never forget.

[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.320]
27 after 10 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.400]
So you want to make some big money ahead for Hollywood Seminole Gaming.

[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.520]
You don't have to go all the way to Vegas.

[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.900]
And you certainly don't have to share your money on those lottery tickets because the jackpot keeps getting bigger.

[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.980]
But your chances are still non-existent.

[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.700]
But Hollywood Seminole Gaming's got a lot of winners.

[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.620]
In fact, a lot of six figure winners this year already.

[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.140]
Hollywood Seminole Gaming's got 550 gaming machines paying out the big bucks.

[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:08.400]
48 round-of-clock poker tables always going strong, featuring all the classic poker games like Omaha Highlow.

[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.400]
Texas Holden, the seven card stud, and there are many weekly poker tournaments.

[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.500]
And daily mini tournaments can also make you a winner.

[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.760]
Four daily tournaments, and this is the same woman by the way that was taken Mondo bread to Wups There's Neighbor,

[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.660]
whose diabetic and has diabetic neuropathy who's losing the feeling in his legs and taking sugar to him.

[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.960]
What kind of baggage will you be checking on today, sir?

[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.160]
Well, I have this case with a fear of abandonment.

[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:33.400]
I carry on with some paranoia and this double bag stuffed with homosexual tendencies.

[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.580]
Welcome to Abnormal Airways.

[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.180]
Today on our flight we'll be cruising at a nice comfortable altitude of 55 feet.

[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.500]
As due to my extreme fear of heights.

[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:50.080]
If you look out our right window now, you'll be able to see the right wing searing off treetops as we travel along at our cruising altitude.

[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:50.920]
To the flight.

[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.860]
The airline who staff and clientele are charcoal of problems.

[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.000]
In case of a water landing, I'll begin to hyperventilate.

[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:04.420]
At which point a panic attack will set in, and I'll begin grasping dangerously for the neck of a person nearest me at that time.

[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:12.060]
Seat cushions may be used as a fence mechanism, but I will then probably try to strangle you with a quart of the breathing tube that drops from overhead.

[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.820]
Fly Abnormal Airways.

[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.100]
I met my wife on this flight last week.

[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:16.940]
Last week, huh?

[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.000]
Yeah, she is dead now though.

[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.180]
And experience the mental skies.

[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.080]
1032-560-WQA, and here's the curl springs. Hello?

[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.520]
Curl springs?

[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.380]
Well, Neil, how are you doing?

[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:29.700]
Okay.

[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.700]
I'm sorry about half the vent on the Kennedy's or a raw telepost.

[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:34.080]
Okay.

[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.420]
Let me just tell you right now, and that's my fault for not saying this.

[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.600]
I have an interesting article where somebody packed me yesterday, but now I have the whole thing by, what's his name?

[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.300]
Rick Stangle from Time Magazine.

[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.960]
I may read it later on, maybe not depending on whether we get any calls today, which we probably won't because there's nobody in town.

[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.060]
But I don't want to hear the K-word today, okay?

[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.220]
I don't want to hear about John Jr. or Senior or Ted.

[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.420]
I don't want to hear it.

[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.000]
I won't tolerate it.

[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.940]
I mean, it was bad enough I thought on Monday that I wanted to poisoning the whole four hours about that, and then I want to begin on Tuesday and again yesterday,

[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:12.800]
because I'm just so incensed about the fact that these are crazy people in the media, and a lot of you people are just as crazy as they are.

[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:20.000]
Wrapped up in horse crap in minutia, but I'm not going to listen to that again today.

[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.540]
If that's all you people got to talk about, have a nice day. See you some other day.

[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.000]
Well, I don't want to hear it.

[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.200]
I'd rather hear about Cuba.

[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.680]
I'd rather hear the C word, whichever one you want to talk about, than the K-word today.

[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.460]
Don't want to discuss it.

[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:39.840]
I've said everything that I could possibly say, and I only want to just multiply it times 10, and then you'll understand how I feel about it.

[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.020]
I'm not going to change my mind.

[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:46.740]
If you're one of those simpletons out there that's in mourning and looking to find a piece of the ashes in the water, well be my guest.

[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.540]
Go have a good time.

[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.480]
We're not going to change each other's mind.

[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.540]
And like I've said before, there's nothing to me worse than boring the audience and god only knows.

[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.440]
I don't want to mention any names, but in talk radio there's certainly plenty of boredom to go around.

[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:01.980]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.180]
Including a lot of the colors out there.

[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:10.820]
The regular is especially the chronics that put you into an immediate coma just thinking about the sound of their voice, much less hearing it.

[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.720]
Oh, this thing with a f***ing disease.

[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.040]
I don't want to hear about it, sir.

[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.880]
I can't... I'm oversaturated if I hear...

[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.540]
If I hear the name one more time, I'm just going to burst.

[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.900]
Here's Virginia Key. Hello.

[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.040]
Hey, good morning, yeah?

[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:27.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.480]
I've got a couple things.

[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:35.040]
One, you know, concerning cancer of the mouth, I have to say that it happened in my family.

[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:41.620]
My father very smirked once a guard if that every couple months, but he always was like, we keep it in his mouth.

[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:48.900]
The thing that's the problem is if you're not smoking it, take it out of your mouth because if it's making physical contact with the inside of your mouth,

[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.220]
you can get a habit of cancer called squamous cell carcinoma.

[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.160]
Oh, bad news.

[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.820]
Right, and he had squamous cell carcinoma, and he actually survived squamous cell carcinoma.

[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.920]
But a year later, a tumor that went from a grape to a grapefruit in two weeks.

[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:01.940]
Lovely.

[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.060]
Yeah, and the chemo is nasty, and nobody knows what that's like.

[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:12.700]
So, you know, it does happen, and if you have any blood there are smokers in the guards, don't leave it in your mouth.

[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.960]
You know, when you're done smoking it's...

[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.680]
That's what I would say.

[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.740]
When you're done with it, get it out of your mouth right away.

[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.240]
And also, I hope you don't jump on me.

[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.520]
I doubt it.

[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:30.180]
You question yesterday, as to drug use in the White House drink, I can't say the name is time and office.

[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:39.320]
Yes, he actually was notorious for having back room LSD parties supplied by the same AFB.

[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.200]
That's true.

[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:40.540]
Yeah.

[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:47.100]
It's supplied by the same people who were doing the experiments on US Black GI's with it for parties,

[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.200]
and actually, they're quite a few notable...

[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:54.840]
...cane of our environment as well as notable people from Hollywood that were coming to those parties.

[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.860]
Yes, they were having back in the early parties at the White House.

[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.400]
Well, there you go.

[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:00.460]
And that's it.

[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.700]
But don't mention that the f***ing who it was.

[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.220]
That's right.

[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.520]
I don't want to burst these people's bubbles.

[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:05.900]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:06.140]
That's it.

[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.340]
And keep that thing out of your mouth.

[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:13.420]
Yeah, it says they want to put a warning on regular cigar smoking can cause cancers of the mouth

[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.800]
and throat even if you don't inhale.

[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.740]
Warning, inhaling cigar smoking causes lung cancer, the more deeply you would inhale the gray.

[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.300]
First of all, I don't know anybody who inhaled cigars, do you?

[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.420]
Have you ever...

[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.860]
I've never inhaled a cigar in my life.

[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.380]
I smoke few packs of cigarettes a day when I was in college and then gave it up because they used to tear up my throat.

[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.660]
But inhaling cigars, to me, it's just ludicrous on the face of it.

[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.840]
And also, they want to put on warning cigars are not a safe alternative to cigarettes.

[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:46.040]
Norman Sharp, president of the cigar Association of America, says cigar smokers tend to be well-educated, well-informed individuals.

[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:51.780]
Sharp cited surveys referred to in the report showing that the vast majority of cigar smokers smoke only occasionally.

[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.580]
And by the way, don't inhale.

[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:54.860]
They don't inhale.

[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.380]
And they smoke only occasionally.

[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:03.300]
And you can get cancer from some of the foods you eat, from the water that you drink, from the polluted air that we're breathing, from a zillion different things.

[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:13.820]
But we're living in an increasingly repressive country where they more and more want to take all of your choices away and make everything against the law.

[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:14.800]
That's the worst part.

[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.080]
Make everything illegal.

[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.560]
You can't advertise it.

[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:18.460]
You can't talk about it.

[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.760]
And then eventually, that's pretty soon in the couple of days, oh, you can't buy them anymore.

[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.940]
So maybe on a black market.

[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.480]
How about cars?

[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.900]
Do we put warning labels on the windshield?

[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.140]
We put it right on the goddamn my ass end of the car.

[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.940]
It says, don't get too close to the ass end because if carbon dioxide will get to you every time.

[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.420]
Here's the mobile in North Miami Beach.

[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:40.700]

[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:41.580]
Hey, hey, don't.

[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.300]
Okay, sir.

[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:51.940]
To respond to what you're saying about the advertising for scars, I don't understand the democracy of the government because this is one thing that really frosting me quite a bit.

[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.540]
The scars are legal as our cigarettes.

[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.060]
I don't understand how many people have been through some life in advertising illegal products.

[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:00.720]
Are you exactly?

[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:01.360]
That's right.

[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.720]
If you don't want them, then pass the law, which I don't agree with.

[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.060]
I mean, I'm opposed, I don't smoke and I don't like being around people who smoke.

[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.080]
No, but I know what you're saying and you're absolutely correct.

[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:17.620]
If they're that evil, then how come the government not only subsidized the tobacco growers for years but has made no interest evidently and making them illegal?

[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.580]
Well, first of all, they know if they're ever going to work number one.

[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.420]
They've created tremendous black market number two.

[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.440]
And what about the taxes they collect?

[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.820]
And number three, the billions of dollars in taxes they collect.

[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.400]
It's unbelievable.

[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.320]
I don't understand who sits there and makes these decisions.

[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:36.600]
A bunch of bureaucrats who have to make it look like they're doing something to protect the public.

[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:37.660]
The ignorant public.

[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.420]
Right, but we shouldn't tackle that.

[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.760]
It's a whole other issue.

[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.360]
The government is always right and whatever they do is right.

[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.940]
That's right. That's right. They're always looking out for our best interest, right?

[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.400]
Anybody believe that?

[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.260]
Absolutely insane.

[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.060]
And have a great day.

[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.260]
Put that thing away.

[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:56.160]
By the way, here's Woody Graber who's still living in a time warp, still living back in Woodstock from 69.

[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.200]
Still looks every part of that silly tie on, you know, just, oh,

[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.600]
fatter than ever by the way.

[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.140]
You're ballooning up like a jug like beef hole.

[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.520]
You and beef all ought to get together.

[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.960]
We're adding we could have the beef hole and after pictures.

[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.280]
Fine, look at this fall, man.

[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.500]
Dead is a door nail five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line.

[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.780]
Gonna be a heavy duty music day today.

[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:20.520]
I can see I can sit back and relax before my visit to my brand new doctor this afternoon.

[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.620]
It was going to probably take two or three points of blood.

[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.600]
Yeah, I found a real doctor by the way.

[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.340]
And also did we ever get a response to that message I left on the other doctor?

[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.540]
Yeah, I think we get a response to that.

[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.440]
No, that's okay.

[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:33.440]
See, that's why I needed to go out and find a real doctor who's got like a real office and a real secretary.

[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.360]
And they really answer the phone and you know little things like that.

[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.180]
Floridians dumb as dirt.

[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:49.800]
Hello, I'm Roger Sange, the mystery garden and today we'll discover the mystery about tomato.

[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:55.240]
Nothing in sight to be more than walking through my vegetable garden and seeing the fruits of my labor come the maturity.

[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.100]
This the beloved tomato.

[00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.180]
Look at this farm round jewel.

[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.920]
Look at the texture of the meat.

[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.380]
It's sweet succulent soft skin.

[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.160]
It's plump red.

[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.760]
Choose the inside.

[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.960]
Oh God.

[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:17.680]
Oh, well, excuse me, I'm going to take this copy of tomato monthly into the privacy of my dad's in quarters and finish up.

[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.300]
This is Roger Strange for the mystery garden.

[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:21.680]
Court, court.

[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.280]
1024 and 560 W.F.

[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:25.760]
You have to lay away.

[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.180]
What he glavers in here is I mentioned I just handed him one of these Prado more square the great new cigar from Nixon.

[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:36.120]
The course we can't let him up in here because we don't want to get the power to be very upset because they're in this non-smoking building environment,

[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.960]
which is totally unacceptable to us.

[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:38.780]
It's a pile of crap.

[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.760]
I have one in my hand right now too.

[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.280]
I'm not going to lie to them up in here, but I just have it in my hand is kind of a silent protest.

[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.640]
To more of this bureaucratic course crap everybody trying to tell us what to do.

[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.860]
Everything is bad for us.

[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:51.760]
Don't promote it.

[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.500]
Don't advertise it.

[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.420]
Well, if you're going to let people in be in business, how can you tell them they can't promote their product?

[00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.860]
You can't have it both ways.

[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.460]
And by the way, how can of course I know they took heavy booze advertising off TV.

[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.400]
But what about beer?

[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:10.280]
We got plenty of sloppy drunks out there who never drank any hard alcohol, but who get sloppy drinker,

[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.060]
three and four six packs.

[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.660]
In fact, there's some guys I know get sloppy as hell drinking two beers.

[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.080]
Some silly people.

[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.500]
We're going to make that illegal.

[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:20.820]
No.

[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.820]
No, because then all the sports leagues would go out of business.

[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.920]
You're just a bunch of hypocritical goody-two shoes.

[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:31.920]
And by the way, isn't this interesting coming from a government where the president loves that good cigar?

[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.940]
Okay. What he does with his business.

[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.660]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.480]
When Monica Lillers, you want to make big sec.

[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.960]
She goes down and gets a lift.

[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.440]
And she might do that too when you come right down to it.

[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.800]
We got a president who loves a good big fat round one.

[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.520]
Okay. And a nice cigar every now and then too.

[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.240]
And we got the FCC telling us, oh, we got to put these warning labels on there.

[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.980]
We want to ban cigar advertise.

[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.360]
It's not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking.

[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.940]
Maybe we're not looking for a safe alternative.

[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.340]
It was okay for George Burns.

[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.900]
He made it till about 150 years old and Weinstein Churchill.

[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.540]
And like I said the other day, I saw that picture last weekend of one of the tabloids.

[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.600]
Here's the oldest living person in North America.

[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.380]
She's 122 years old.

[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.420]
And she had the photograph.

[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.020]
She's got a bag of burning in her hand in the cigarette too.

[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.200]
How do you like that?

[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.340]
122 years old.

[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:27.740]
Here's plantation.

[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:28.200]
Hello.

[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.280]
Hello.

[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.940]
Yes, I am.

[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:32.660]
The assistant you went on vacation.

[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:40.500]
Now one word has been on the radio on television about those police that were flipping those girls out.

[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:41.520]
Yeah.

[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.160]
Of course not because they buried the story.

[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.360]
It's very nicely covered up.

[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.240]
And we hear all this crap about the last even on our local channels.

[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.100]
That was a very major local scandal story.

[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:57.840]
And like I said at the time, somebody's getting paid off somewhere and they covered it up and you'll never hear another word about it.

[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:03.620]
And then the two sons from higher-lea, those guys, they're probably going around intimidating potential witnesses.

[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.080]
So that story's been buried.

[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.040]
Oh, I'm great.

[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.900]
And by the way, a week from today is the Penny Sales Tag Election.

[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.040]
Just say, okay.

[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.780]
That's what I was just preparing about the DCD as that they're putting out on that.

[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:16.460]
Yeah, I've seen that.

[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:16.880]
Of course.

[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.940]
Now you know what?

[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.860]
I don't live in Dade, and I'm proud.

[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.640]
I'm in Broward.

[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.900]
But it was able to close the booth, all the booths and fire all the telecom actors on the 29th, if it passed.

[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.100]
And it would pass.

[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.160]
But that's the booth you're going to be there for years after that any taxes on.

[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.480]
There's no way to get away with those toll booths.

[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:36.220]
Okay.

[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.440]
They can't.

[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.860]
Have a great life, sir.

[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:44.260]
Here's another fact from somebody Tim who says he's opposed to the Penny Sales Tags and so on.

[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:44.780]
That's right.

[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:49.080]
I'm doing a hell of a pubic service because a week from today, seven days you got to get your brains together.

[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:49.400]
Okay.

[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:57.100]
And to get everybody you know who's registered in Voting Dade County out next Thursday to say to Mayor penis and his brother trying to perpetrate again on the public with all the lies.

[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.300]
And with the help by the way of most of the whips in the media in this town.

[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.280]
You are disgrace.

[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.820]
You're at a disgrace.

[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.080]
Putting these ads on TV showing the worst traffic jams.

[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.560]
I know it's the third most congested place in America.

[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:13.960]
And then of course doing that thing with increasing the tolls just at a time with very little.

[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.940]
Oh, advanced warning to make people frustrated and psychotic.

[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.980]
That's your government at work.

[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:26.840]
Creating as much psychosis for you as they possibly can as much hassle to get you frustrated so that you'll say, okay, whatever you want.

[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.620]
Like that one guy said that they showed on the news.

[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.220]
Okay, one percent, two percent, whatever you want.

[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.680]
Just get rid of these tolls.

[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:39.320]
And as I said at the time as somebody who uses the turnpike virtually every day of my life.

[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.520]
There are no long lines.

[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.000]
There's no major hassle.

[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.620]
There's no big song and a dance.

[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.120]
Life goes on.

[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.380]
It's not the end of the world.

[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.880]
And the people who use it are the ones who should and are paying for it.

[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.080]
Not all the taxpayers who don't even use those roads.

[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.580]
What about the people who live in North Day, for example?

[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.040]
Who have nothing, who never even encounter those toll booths.

[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:06.340]
Or maybe like maybe once or twice a year for the 50 cents or a dollar that I might save them.

[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.320]
What about those people?

[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.360]
So those people have to pay an increased sales tax?

[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:09.620]
No.

[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:09.940]
No.

[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:13.780]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:14.100]
Hello?

[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:15.580]
Neil.

[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.440]
Long time listeners.

[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.800]
It has since data.

[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:22.480]
The first time caller you're the only thing on radio worth listening to in this town.

[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.620]
You wouldn't say that again, man.

[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.080]
Two things.

[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.980]
I'm driving around downtown.

[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:31.420]
I'm enjoying a fan-lulley raid that was made in that country to begin with.

[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:31.740]

[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:32.600]
All right.

[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.040]
Nobody's going to make me stop smoking it.

[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.660]
I don't chew on it when I'm not smoking it.

[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.320]
I'm not going to get mouth cancer.

[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:45.400]
And ever since Stan King shot Harvey Milk, we've had the Twinkie defense and we've had Richie's

[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:45.660]
Amor.

[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:50.820]
And we've had the safety Nazis as the motoring press likes to call them and want to protect us from ourselves.

[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:51.200]
Yeah.

[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.540]
I don't know that you've ever referred to them as the safety Nazis, but here they go.

[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:55.300]
They ride again.

[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.300]
The pleasure police.

[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.160]
Absolutely.

[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.600]
I get that's what's the guard day.

[00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:58.960]
Right.

[00:37:59.140 --> 00:37:59.520]
That's right.

[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.820]
That other station.

[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.160]
But I just want to tell you, you're the standard bearer.

[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.100]
You're the voice of reason, the voice of sanity.

[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.500]
Don't ever let them shut you up.

[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:08.820]
Okay.

[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.000]
Shameless request.

[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:10.540]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.500]
You don't got rocked you.

[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:12.220]
You got it.

[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.100]
All right.

[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:13.820]
Thanks.

[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:14.300]
See you.

[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:14.800]
Bye.

[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:21.180]
That's right.

[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.140]
Okay.

[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:41.220]

[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:41.420]

[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:41.600]
Okay.

[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.040]
Okay.

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.040]

[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:42.500]
Okay.

[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:42.600]

[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:42.600]

[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:42.600]

[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:42.600]

[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.320]
Okay.

[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:48.700]
Okay.

[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.100]
Okay.

[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:57.400]
Okay.

[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:57.400]

[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:57.400]

[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:57.400]

[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:57.400]

[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:57.400]

[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:57.400]

[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:57.400]

[00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:58.580]
Okay.

[00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:58.920]
Okay.

[00:38:58.920 --> 00:38:58.920]

[00:38:58.920 --> 00:38:59.140]
Okay.

[00:38:59.140 --> 00:38:59.140]

[00:38:59.140 --> 00:38:59.140]

[00:38:59.140 --> 00:38:59.140]

[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.140]
Okay.

[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:01.160]

[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:01.420]
Okay.

[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.180]
Okay.

[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:02.840]
Okay.

[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:03.480]
Okay.

[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:05.840]
Okay.

[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.260]
Okay.

[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:08.260]

[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:08.260]

[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:08.260]

[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.160]
Okay.

[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:17.580]
Okay.

[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:17.640]
Okay.

[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:18.900]
Have you ever met anybody like that?

[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:19.140]
No.

[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.900]
Maybe there are some of them out there somewhere.

[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.520]
In fact, you know, the people in show business

[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.940]
that always had a cigar in their hand,

[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.380]
you notice they were never lit.

[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.660]
They were like a prop.

[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:30.820]
Like George Burns.

[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.060]
I mean, always had a cigar, but they were never lit.

[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.420]
Because they were talking anyway.

[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.940]
And as you know, if you are cigar smoker,

[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.840]
when you're talking and trying to keep a cigar,

[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.100]
no matter how good the cigar is,

[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.300]
it ain't going to stay lit forever.

[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:43.660]
Okay.

[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.300]
It's going to go out.

[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.400]
Unless you're puffing on it and the soggy too.

[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.960]
Just astonishing how wonderful this government is,

[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:54.560]
how full of crap, how hypocritical,

[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.400]
don't do as we do, do as we say.

[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.860]
In fact, maybe they can just sell them as dildos now.

[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.120]
Although they might cause vaginal cancer

[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.180]
if you leave it in there too long.

[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.260]
Or maybe even rectal cancer,

[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.920]
all depending on where the president is sticking it.

[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.080]
Not if you leave them in the wrapper.

[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.160]
Yeah, but Luther gets pissed off

[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.240]
if you leave it in him too long.

[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:14.440]
Here's a mobile in the keys.

[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:14.760]
Hello.

[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:16.240]
Hey, Neil.

[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:16.740]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.020]
Long time listener from your old camp today.

[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.320]
I could have said the hammer gets upset,

[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.540]
but they might have thought it was the wrong hand.

[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:21.780]
Yes.

[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.400]
Yeah, nothing on the radio over there still.

[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.360]
You were talking about the cigars and stuff,

[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.720]
and I was thinking, however, in clear water now,

[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.340]
we've got the swim suit police

[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:35.780]
that are running over.

[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.760]
They've got a very strict definition of how much cleavage

[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.060]
or rear end is supposed to show.

[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.980]
Nobody's being robbed or murdered or killed

[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.300]
in anything in clear water.

[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.740]
They're so little crime now.

[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:46.080]
They're running out.

[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.500]
Hey, listen to Hollywood here for years.

[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.760]
We've had the T-shirt police.

[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.940]
If you were in a T-shirt out there that Mayor Galani

[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.160]
gets pissed off about,

[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.240]
they're going to throw your ass in jail for that too.

[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.220]
Like the beach.

[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.860]
Oh my God, straight to jail.

[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.720]
We don't want to offend any old farts.

[00:40:58.900 --> 00:40:59.040]
Oh!

[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:00.220]
Unbelievable.

[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:01.960]
Hey, I have a shameless request for you.

[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:02.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.460]
Would you play the bagpipe or guy,

[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.760]
the Scottish guy talking to the kid about the bagpipe?

[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.740]
Well, I think about it.

[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:09.480]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.140]
Great day, sir.

[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:10.360]
Bye.

[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:10.900]
Okay.

[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:12.860]
567.

[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:13.840]
Look at this phone, man.

[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.740]
I've said it's cleared out.

[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.820]
You should've seen our crowded Pompo Park last night.

[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.640]
Me and Rich had about 10 other of our best close personal friends.

[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:20.620]
That was pretty much it.

[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:22.760]
567-0560,

[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.640]
£560 on a mobile one line.

[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.380]
Here's a mobile-informed lottery deal.

[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:27.520]
Hello.

[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.360]
Hey, Neil, how are you?

[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:29.840]
Okay, sir.

[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:30.880]
Just wondering,

[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.200]
you remember Merrick's stairhym back in the 70s,

[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.980]
talking to China about a sales tax for Metro Rail?

[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.760]
Sure, that's what I just got through saying, yes.

[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.380]
What the hell overhappen to that money?

[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.340]
What do you mean whatever happened to it?

[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.740]
They wasted a billion dollars of money.

[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.960]
They built a piece of crap that you got now that nobody rides.

[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.200]
And now he was on sale.

[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.440]
And they didn't give you all the buses that they lied about then,

[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.700]
that they were supposed to give us.

[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:49.920]

[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.360]
These buses that they're promising now,

[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.940]
they were supposed to come with a first billion dollar boom doggo.

[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:55.060]
It's just amazing.

[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.440]
And he was on Channel 10 this morning,

[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:01.340]
and I can't believe Channel 10 put him on there to propose and advertise for that

[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.220]
once percent sales tax like.

[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:03.620]
Yeah.

[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.800]
Some days now they're going to give Rich your treatment equal time to go on there

[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.600]
and talk about it,

[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.740]
because I know Channel 10 is editorializing against it.

[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.620]
They're doing it against it.

[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:13.940]
Let me say it again.

[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.560]
They've run an editorial opposed to the penny sales tax, yes.

[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.080]
Excellent. That's a wonderful thing.

[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.500]
But I'm certainly hoping that if they're given shields like merits,

[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.900]
deerheim opportunity, go on here.

[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.880]
And you notice now I'm hearing that they're on Zeta,

[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:24.640]
they're on with this one.

[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.480]
Of course, they won't come on this.

[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.180]
They won't even ask to come on this station,

[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.620]
because we wouldn't be laughing out of the guy they're building,

[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.960]
and they know that they'd give one hell of a time on this show.

[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.080]
It's just amazing.

[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:34.180]
Thank you.

[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:35.280]
Have a good day, pal.

[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.420]
Just remember, sir.

[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:36.700]
No.

[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.680]
Two easy letters.

[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:38.640]
And...

[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:39.740]
Oh, no.

[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.100]
No, no, no.

[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:45.480]
One week from today, they've lied to you and lied to you and conned you

[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.720]
and tried every way in the world to try to frustrate you and aggravate you,

[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.900]
and then it turned around and say,

[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.880]
oh, well, if you don't want this,

[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.040]
and then that bull crap about the guy damn,

[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:56.620]
the expressway authority,

[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.480]
whatever they call it, the MDX, the MDX,

[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.480]
whatever they call it, that thing.

[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.340]
Thanks, Woody.

[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:03.860]
Have a great day.

[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.520]
Enjoy that cigar.

[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:05.520]
Gabe Woody and I cigar.

[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.320]
He's going to light it up,

[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.460]
or as soon as he gets outside,

[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:10.220]
he's going to light that thing up and start a bonfire with it.

[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.900]
Don't get that ponytail on fire, by the way.

[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:15.860]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.900]
Let's ban cigars.

[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:18.320]
Let's ban spaghetti.

[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.440]
Let's ban sugar.

[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.820]
Let's ban everything.

[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.620]
Siggurets, alcohol, booze.

[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:23.760]
Let's ban bread in the air.

[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:24.620]
Let's ban cars.

[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.020]
Cars kill people, okay?

[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.160]
Now, guns are okay.

[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:31.960]
Guns are fine.

[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.580]
There's the warning label on guns.

[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:34.220]
That's right.

[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.140]
And the same kids can go out and buy a gun.

[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.560]
They can't buy a pack of cigarettes.

[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.240]
Just stop and think about that.

[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:41.700]
You want to know why?

[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.100]
Because cigarettes kill people.

[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.700]
They're dangerous.

[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.540]
Ever see anybody point a lit cigarette?

[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:49.280]
Anybody else?

[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:49.700]
No.

[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.260]
Stick them up, baby.

[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.140]
I got a chest or field here, man.

[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.300]
Oh, speak of that.

[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.160]
Ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:57.700]
Shack!

[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.080]
Oh, drag.

[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.440]
I'm in full of gay romance.

[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.640]
Where gay sandals and they wear tight pants?

[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.780]
And every one drench up to bottom every day.

[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.560]
West with the miracle of being gay.

[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.020]
The very best of packets in the USA.

[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.360]
Giving big, big, big pleasure and a big, big way.

[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.980]
The very best of packets in the USA.

[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.380]
Giving big, big, big pleasure and a big, big way.

[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:23.940]
Oh, drag.

[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:25.780]
That's right, baby.

[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.240]
Find the big, big, big, big, big, big, big way.

[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.360]
You choice of the fact of America.

[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.600]
You know something, I better play that now while I still can

[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.020]
because if they find out we're playing something even though it's a parody

[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.740]
promoting cigarettes or any kind of a tobacco product,

[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.720]
they'll probably come in here and shut the guy down and place down.

[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.960]
You live in a police state.

[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.520]
I've been telling you that for years and people,

[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.460]
they all end the deal.

[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:48.600]
He's such a character.

[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:49.580]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.040]
He said it.

[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.280]
Yeah, police state.

[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.640]
10.56 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.460]
If you want a great cigar and you don't give a crap about the FTC

[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:01.680]
or the FCC or the SEOUC or whatever it is,

[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.260]
CK, then go to Nix, all right,

[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.260]
because Nix makes you fantastic cigars.

[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.720]
And if you don't overdo it, you probably won't get some big jug

[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.120]
in a clump or tumor in your throat or on your tongue or on your lips or whatever.

[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.520]
It's about about what my mother says.

[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.880]
Who's digging through the waist back and looking for cigar stubs, no doubt.

[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:19.980]
I got a stub for you, okay?

[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:26.200]
You make it, you make it, you make it, you make it, you make it.

[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:37.820]
You make it, you make it, you make it, you make it, you make it, you make it.

[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.080]
Because the Havis there need to make it.

[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.700]
You should have there need to make it, you make it, you make it.

[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.440]
You make it, you make it, you make it.

[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:53.880]
You make it, you make it, you make it.

[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.800]
You make it, you make it, you make it.

[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:55.740]
You make it, you make it, you make it.

[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:55.740]

[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:55.740]

[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:55.740]

[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:55.920]
You make it, you make it.

[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:56.180]
You make it, you make it.

[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:56.180]

[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.720]
I say, I deny.

[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.840]
I say, I deny.

[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:06.920]
I say, I deny.

[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:08.640]
I say, I deny.

[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.180]
I say, I deny.

[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:09.180]

[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:09.180]

[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:09.180]

[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:09.180]

[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:09.180]

[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:09.180]

[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:09.180]

[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:09.180]

[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:09.180]

[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:09.960]
I say, I deny.

[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.500]
I say, I deny.

[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:14.280]

[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:14.280]

[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:14.280]

[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:14.280]

[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:14.280]

[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.280]
I say, I deny.

[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:16.220]
I say, I deny.

[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:21.700]
I say, I deny.

[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.240]
I say, I deny.

[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:24.180]
I say, I deny.

[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.600]
I am a real type of guy.

[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.300]
Rastas me.

[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:31.040]
Rastas you.

[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.640]
Rastas me.

[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.600]
Rastas you.

[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:35.920]
Rastas you.

[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.360]
Rastas you.

[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:37.760]

[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.720]
Rastas you.

[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.260]
I might go check shows.

[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.600]
And I write a motorbike.

[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:51.160]
Chicken soup with tomato.

[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.180]
I need a lot.

[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.640]
That's what I like.

[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.120]
I have your vacation.

[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.620]
Crazzy, spicy, spicy, spicy.

[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.420]
Blankin' and gifilter fish.

[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.480]
That's much more my taste.

[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:10.260]
Rastas me.

[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.720]
Rastas you.

[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:13.600]
Rastas you.

[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.080]
Rastas you.

[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.260]
Rastas you.

[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:21.860]
Rastas you.

[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:21.860]

[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.140]
Oi.

[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.420]
Oi.

[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.520]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:48.260]

[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.820]
Who got hell of you?

[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.180]
Oi.

[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.040]
Rastas me.

[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:09.480]
Rastas you.

[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.700]
Rastas you.

[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.040]
Rastas you.

[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.240]
Rastas you.

[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.460]
Rastas you.

[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:19.460]

[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.020]
Rastas I.

[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:26.900]
Rastas you.

[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:28.280]
Rastas you.

[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:28.680]
Rastas you.

[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.520]
Rastas you.

[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.040]
Rastas you.

[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.620]
Rastas you.

[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:43.100]
You know, I just, I'm so sorry you just told me that.

[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:48.260]
I'm channel surfing here during that thing and I had seen it and I'm there and they're still on the

[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.360]
Business and George is all the networks are on a two

[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:57.500]
I mean, it's 11 o'clock in the morning the morning TV shows are long since over with them. I write

[00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.840]
And they're still

[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.200]
fleeting moment earlier this morning

[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.840]
I mean

[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:08.440]
You know, I'm gonna have to fight hard to resist the temptation to get started again

[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:14.580]
How many days how many weeks how many months does this go on?

[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:23.580]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. We got 6,000 open lines here waiting on you

[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.400]
Here's for it later. Dale. Hello

[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.720]
Deal. Yes, sir. You were telling that icon, you know

[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:33.240]
God was that pathetic or what was that pathetic? Uh-huh

[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:37.200]
5 6 7 0 5 and you know how long he waited for that

[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:43.080]
That was and plus it didn't even make it on the air not because it was a portographic. It was just stupid

[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:49.600]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line. Here's the mobile in the mine. Hello

[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:54.220]
I'm Neil. I just like to thank you and George for putting me on to the most logically

[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.440]
and and and lightning book I've ever read

[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:03.600]
Fairwellly God. Yeah, well, they don't like it at the sunset and I'll tell you that the religion editor here. Don't like it

[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:08.120]
The thing is about Galileo remember that yeah, that is that it can

[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.600]
91 they finally admitted that

[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:17.760]
The earth revolves around the sun rather than the sun revolve around the air. Yeah, we know found we know that very book. Okay

[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:23.440]
Okay, one more call now we can uh, maybe that is that it here's Miami. Hello

[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:26.000]
Miami

[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:33.280]
36 seconds they waited and that was our last call they they didn't talk okay. Play some music, all right

[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:38.000]
Yeah, I'm not gonna fight this. I mean, I realized there's nobody here with a brain and with my q-large

[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.560]
than the thumbnail but we're out of business

[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:48.640]
Get them off. Okay, you play you've got the nerve. Oh, I forgot. Sorry forget about that mirror America worst experience I had

[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:58.160]
5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. I guess I am gonna read that thing that article by that

[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.800]
KC stangle guy from Time Magazine. I guess I will

[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:05.420]
Because these people don't want to talk about anything else and maybe they don't want to talk about that either

[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:11.280]
I just can't imagine my spending the whole week on this thing when I'm sitting here screaming about the overkill on it

[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.220]
Pardon that expression

[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:17.860]
I'm gonna have to spend the whole week because you people are uh got locked y'all and don't have anything else you want to talk about

[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:21.420]
And it's big on a cigar Dave by the way if this thing goes through he's gonna be out of business

[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:27.860]
I just mentioned that in passing of course my good close personal friend Dave

[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:32.220]
Zeppelitz remember what they said down in next about cigar Dave. He's an asshole. That's what they said

[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.160]
Here's a mobile in North Miami. Hello

[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.620]
Mobile in North Miami

[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.520]
Hi Neil how you doing okay sir?

[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:46.840]
Uh, I just want to tell you I was listening that last night for the night before to fill Henry

[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:51.860]
I've listened to him on the computer. Yeah about three times a week. Are you sure? Yeah

[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:53.500]
Absolutely, yeah

[00:51:54.280 --> 00:52:00.820]
And uh, whatever anybody said about anybody being better than him there was never going to be anyone better than him except yourself

[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:03.780]
Maybe and you're just a different style

[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:10.860]
He had the funniest thing he had a guy on who had who sounded very similar to somebody that used to come on his show here

[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:18.080]
He was a naval retired guy and he was tried to describe that if they found the Kennedy body

[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:23.380]
Part of it should be buried with John part of it should be buried with his new wife

[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:30.020]
Uh-huh, and he was saying like an arm here and a leg there. Yeah, and it's amazing the people of Kansas didn't quite understand

[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:34.020]
And they were calling up concern. I bet you they're quite sarcotic about that. Oh

[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:39.400]
How can you do and it's kind of ironic because this whole thing is costing the taxpayers an arm and a leg anyway

[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:45.600]
Yeah, and I mean it was really distressing to some of these people because they could understand how you can

[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:53.740]
And if they only found 20% of the body could you put 10% here in like 10% there right and it was absolutely

[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.180]
standard fill and

[00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:59.760]
It's a pity they can't put them on a 10 o'clock here

[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.940]
Instead of me listening on the computer half. Yeah, well

[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:07.780]
Well, what do you want to hear the great Phil Henry when you hear some silly gambling show for a GA members, you know

[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:10.240]
Have a great day pal you too

[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.060]
So I'm gonna say how to fill he's great

[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:14.700]
Yeah, the guy that called about Jim Phillips is better than a Phil Henry

[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:19.660]
And dignified that come out with a response anymore. That's how ludicrous that was right on the face of it

[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:25.440]
By the way, what kind of an operation? Not only don't we know about the traffic, but we have to get the information about jigsman

[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:29.080]
Donald was hired by the panthers. This is your panther flagship station, okay

[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.440]
This is supposed to be the big song and dance

[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.580]
Sports station that we're paying all that money for all those broadcast rights

[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:37.900]
And we have to find out from the Palm Beach post that the panthers of hired jigsman

[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:42.540]
Donald will be the radio play by play guy which we're gonna carry the games. Does that tell you all you need to know? Yes

[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.220]
We're coolest man and we're proud of it

[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:50.220]
Want to buy some spots no on the marlin games no

[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.200]
The media is sick and they talk badly

[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.700]
Hey there. This is Wisconsin Al for trapping beaver

[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:04.500]
You know, I just got back from seeing nodding hill now. What is a deal with that Julia Roberts lips?

[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:07.560]
Does she have two bottom lips on that face of hers?

[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:14.060]
Anyways today we want to talk about the Y2K problem and what to do with that beaver

[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:20.560]
You may have trapped during that time you may discover that there is no power after December 31st now

[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:26.020]
There's two things you can do you can build a wood fire in your backyard and that may be possible

[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:30.860]
But you do need to expect to be eating some raw beaver during that time

[00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:39.120]
And speaking from experience raw beaver is pretty good right Eddie and you can learn more about this from getting my new book

[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.500]
Eating beaver raw

[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.040]
Hey Eddie that's not the beaver I was talking about

[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:48.620]
This is Wisconsin Al for trapping beaver. See you again

[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:53.900]
1115 at 560 wqm on a coma inducing day here in the big city

[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.940]
Here's our last call. It's a mobile and four-letter. Hello

[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:03.640]
You yes, sir. Yeah, that's you know respect to the security officer that was shot in the Metcareo

[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:07.280]
And I'd just say I hope to catch that scumbag was shouting

[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:08.880]
Yeah

[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.680]
Yep, that takes it. Okay, that takes care of our calls for the day

[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:18.640]
Thank you. It's been nice being with you. I guess I am going to read this thing by a rich dangle from time magazines since you people have got nothing to say

[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:23.500]
And since I guess I can talk about this again today because there's nothing else than anybody who's got any interest in

[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:28.280]
Boy talk about a bunch of deadheads

[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.380]
Rick's dangle who's an MSNBC contributor by the way

[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:41.360]
Boy says let the myth rest in peace getting over our obsession with the Kennedy saga. This is from the internet from yesterday

[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:50.340]
Says John Kennedy he didn't use the middle initial or the junior nor should we was a smart ride charmingly self-deprecating man

[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:53.840]
We're one of the most famous last names in the world. He's died much too early

[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.680]
But please let us not turn his death into something his life was not

[00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:04.100]
Let us not turn it into the orgy of sentiment and commerce of mindless mythologizing and cheap emotionalism that we saw with Princess Diana

[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:11.140]
Let us not make its funeral in the summer grand but Erzot state occasion presided over by solemn anchors looking for the right words

[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:16.460]
But I suppose that's impossible television the only hearth we all gather around in moments of national

[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:19.140]
Import will make milk his death for all its worth

[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:24.520]
It'll become a signature television event wherever you when you heard yada yada yada

[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:29.600]
The anchors of the evening news and the morning shows are already sitting in their directors chairs in high-annas

[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:34.940]
Port they've already asked the excruciatingly indelicate questions that pass for journalism and ask them of people

[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:40.220]
Who are all too eager to answer and talk about what they hardly know or suspect the carry on birds have landed

[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:45.460]
The problem is we secretly like tragedy the Greeks understood this insoded Shakespeare

[00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:48.380]
Watching a tragedy unfold is cathartic for the viewers

[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:53.600]
Especially since we can go home safe and sound afterwards and if that tragic figure is already famous

[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.060]
Well, that is the most media combustible combination

[00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:59.480]
Television in the tabloid press have made us a nation of voyirs

[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:05.120]
And there's something profoundly and disturbingly absorbing about the funerals of the famous just try to stop people from watching

[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:10.520]
The relentless focus on John Kennedy's death shows our nation in its least flattering aspect

[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:13.920]
Note how the networks never omit the middle initial or the final junior

[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:19.840]
The attention paid to the Kennedy family reveals once again our vestigial longing for a royal family

[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:24.260]
That feeling is as old as the republic many of the framers wanted to call the president of the United States

[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:25.960]
His highness or his excellency

[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.040]
Fortunately, we opted for more democratic title of mr. President

[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:35.200]
But we create royalty where it did not exist before we see it in our current presidential race with the two early front runners

[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:41.120]
Are both see a ski out what is that word of early political vines these George W. Bush is the son of one president

[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:46.220]
Al Gore who holds the job that was considered heir apparent by the founders is the son of a distinguished senator

[00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:52.960]
The whole point of America was to rid ourselves of aristocratic privilege and here it is sneaking back due under the guise of democracy

[00:57:54.260 --> 00:58:00.400]
And it's our own apathy and this engagement. That's the blame our addiction to the Kennedy family is both

[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.500]
Undemocratic and in infantilizing

[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:09.300]
How many times have we already read about the curse or myth of the Kennedys the curse is the part in part the result of a bunch of young men

[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:16.580]
Who have a predilection for doing some very dumb things like skiing backwards or flying after dark on a hazy night without being an experience enough pilot

[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:22.260]
The Greek analogies of Icarus whose hubris caused them to fly too close to the sun and melt his wings

[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:26.860]
The ancient Greeks understood that a curse was not something outside of us, but something we do to ourselves

[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:33.060]
The myth of the Kennedys is one that we create ourselves and we can constantly ended simply but not believing in it

[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:40.240]
Let us do so now Kamala was opposed assassination public relations invention of Jackie Kennedy and Teddy white

[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.440]
Democracy do not have crown princes

[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:47.440]
Let his family quietly bury a graceful young man. Let us bury our absorption with this family

[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:51.140]
It's a sign of our adolescence as a nation that we turn our leaders into celebrities

[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:55.900]
And they look worse for some cosmic meaning in the death of a young man who was still trying to find himself

[00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.340]
The myth is not healthy for us as a nation

[00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:02.940]
Nor for all those Kennedy boys who believe in it and then mod up themselves in their desperation to live up to it

[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.740]
Our obsession with this kind of thing is speaks to a lack in our own lives

[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:11.260]
It's a desperately sad event for those closest to him

[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:14.860]
But let us not turn it into the many of the grieving that we saw in England over Diana

[00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:18.960]
That's suggested a nation of people whose lives only had meaning when linked however

[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.940]
Distantly to some symbolic figure

[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:25.380]
When your life is too small you look for something grand to attach it to

[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.100]
Let's just make our lives a little larger instead

[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:31.840]
John Kennedy was ironic about the celebrity culture he was born and do

[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:34.580]
He was partly amused by it partly appalled by it

[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.520]
And he was just learning converted to his own advantage

[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:39.220]
I think he would have been alarmed by the media tempest

[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:43.640]
John Kennedy had dignity in life. Let us not take it from him in death. Let him rest in peace.

[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:44.200]
Amen

[00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:49.640]
Senior editor at time and a regular contributed to MSNBC on the internet

[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:53.220]
Thank you rich dangle and on off a lot of those words sounded very familiar

[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:56.260]
But I've been saying the last three days and taking a lot of crap for saying it

[00:59:56.260 --> 01:00:01.620]
Because it happens to be true. Grow to hell up. Okay. It's stop running around bragging that you have no life

[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:04.840]
And you have to live some vicarious existence to somebody else who was famous

[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.480]
God nice going Rick and thanks to whoever fact me that again

[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:18.960]

Switching gears on what we have no calls here today. I mean any gear you go on to is okay with me. Okay. I was just

[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.760]
I just left my house and I was watching CBN

[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:39.000]
This morning they I don't know if you ever watched that like the 700 Club. How they yeah

[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:46.120]
Try to they try to disguise CBN to make it look like a real news program like like CNN or statewide. Yeah, the news to Christian

[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:53.300]
Right, they don't they don't they don't they they kind of hide it so that it looks like a real news program

[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:59.840]
You don't even realize that you're watching a Christian broadcasting news network until you know five minutes into it or whatever if you just flipping around

[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:04.540]
That's just one point on it. The second thing was this morning they had it

[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:08.000]
like a 15 20 minute piece on homosexuality

[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.560]
And I was just what a surprise. Oh, yeah, they

[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:18.800]
They rebroadcast it is very interesting is they rebroadcast it out of think at 11 o'clock the same one tonight if you're interested

[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.380]
No, I don't think so I think I'll pass but anyway, we're just talking about how

[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:29.780]
Um, they just had a bunch of people on there who converted who were homosexuals and they were saying that it's like

[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:35.120]
It's like alcoholism that it you can change if you wish it was just pretty hilarious

[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:40.960]
It's like you might get a kick out of it. They were they gave a walk out in the CBN now for

[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.380]
Well, they better hope that we all don't convert because if we do they won't have any they won't have any subjects matter

[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:50.900]
We know skit goats anymore, so they better hope it doesn't happen. That's all I got yeah, okay, I'm right there

[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.840]
Okay, one call left in the board. I guess there are gonna be no calls today

[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:58.640]
I guess so you know I could go back into that john Henry thing too, but my waste my time when it's obvious to nobody cares

[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:04.200]

You talking about the government. They're gonna put a tax on hamburgers are joined

[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:19.680]
They'd like to some politicians would like to put tax on hamburger joints and

[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.000]

And that's I got pretty upset about that and they had like three or four things. I know the thing I had on was

[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:36.840]
You not allowed a smoke in a bar anymore and these guys all these in our telepornier some play I can't remember where it was

[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:41.280]
And these guys are going broke because once they go to go out and have a drink

[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.620]
They can't have a smoke with it right

[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.560]
Well the government just keeps telling us what to do. Maybe Ross burrow the right

[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:52.620]
Thing the number one gross and it's broken history in this country is the federal government

[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:19.800]
Here was a man that talked more crap. I mean it's just I'm inconceivable to me that anybody could come on and just talk

[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:24.540]
Non-stop littering generalities, which is why even a wooden statue like Al Gore

[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:30.360]
Decimated them when they had that debate remember that just made a monkey out of him a full out of him

[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:38.660]
Even Larry King even that ass sucking Larry who made Ross Perot into the whatever the hell it was that he became by putting them on here 50 million times

[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.980]
Even he was astonished

[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.560]
Even he had to put his lip away for about two seconds

[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.600]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. How are you buddy? Okay?

[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.260]

The pain is so great and it's only 11 25

[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:21.760]
I think I need to go see that doctor right now like tell him it's an emergency

[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:24.720]
I

[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.680]
Mean I know it's boring and somebody that's why I think when I'm vacation again like it was just a few days after it came back from his last one

[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.140]
Jim Mandice today or two

[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.020]
Maybe Joe Constell would like to do auto talk from an adult to a clock

[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:41.020]
Come on come on in here and take over outside over in the corner there going little like that. I'll stick my thumb in my

[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.280]
well

[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:48.640]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.060]
It's your great to be in South Florida some time in it

[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:52.480]
You

[01:04:54.360 --> 01:05:01.380]
See I realized I never thought about it before until I went to the track last night and the people that were moaning and groaning that there wasn't going to be anybody there that because as a starting

[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:08.160]
This just these last few days this month from like the middle of July until like uh, well I'm up in a half to the end of August

[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:12.840]
This is the most deadly of them all in South Florida. They're all pretty deadly, but this is the all-time worst

[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.740]
And so as a result that must be just a coincidence

[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:17.560]
That's why the

[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.040]
The mayor decided July 29 on a Thursday when we never have elections anyone a Thursday

[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.240]
Be a really great. They just need get an election there

[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:29.120]
But he can get all his people down there and try to put over those penny sales tax anybody think so yeah, I think it might have been

[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.440]
Like I said Jim Mandice you too

[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:37.400]
We got the talking baseball with Donnie B who wouldn't know a hockey announcer if he stuck his finger deep inside of his rectum

[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:42.060]
And then we got 6 30 the a pregame the braves at the marlins again tonight marlins one another game

[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.060]
And the interest no want to build that stating for John Henry

[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:47.440]
No looks by the way in that picture in the paper today like he's sucking on a person and

[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:53.220]
Want to see John Henry sucking on a person and open up your uh, whatever paper that's in today

[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.800]
Got a lovely picture of him with that big sucking look

[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.340]
Talk dirty to me

[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.540]
And I'll time for language lesson of the day repeat after me

[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:07.080]
Nephapah is taba in albanyo. Oh, it's not possible

[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:12.220]
Uncle is tamuerto ii which means my father must have been in the bathroom

[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:14.740]
Either that or something died in there

[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:16.180]
Ha's the lup humbuck

[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.200]

560 w to q a m

[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:24.640]
I think next time my mother comes over to babysit the dogs instead of like leaving candy wrappers buried in the garbage

[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:28.040]
Just to make sure she doesn't have to like uh, go digging through the garbage

[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.700]
rifling through it whatever the hell were what she used

[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:35.520]
I think what I'll do is leave some uh things out on that but not the wrappers. I'll leave the candy bars out there

[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.860]
Right on the kitchen table

[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.860]
You think they'll still be there when I get back no no

[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:47.600]
The same person that's trying to poison people with sugar that they're not aware of like sticking sugar

[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.040]
In the goddamn sauce for the shrimp

[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:54.320]
Which I had to bring that out of the cl- I like sugar and bring in mongol bread to her neighbor upstairs

[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.680]
Who's got diabetic neuropathy nice going ma

[01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.720]
I was rummaging to his car bitch

Here's the four-letter. Hello. Hey, you know how you doing. Okay, sir

[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.840]
You got John Henry's an asshole. Yeah, I know that and I'm uh

I will never go to a marlin's game. I don't care

[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:17.560]
If the stadium fee paid for it or public pay sort of course I care about that. Yeah

[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.140]
It's yeah

[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:22.200]
Even Wayne ought to pack their crap and get the hell out of here

[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.820]
I know there's an interesting thing in this uh

[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:26.880]
Jose land beat the southward inside of this gossip column this morning

[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.760]
It says marlin's owner John Henry

[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:34.160]
High tiling out of a Fort Lauderdale Rotary Club meeting Wednesday to fly to Alaska his 165

[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:39.680]
A yacht is 155 foot yacht is more than Juno, Alaska. Okay. Here's a guy. It's a multi-billionaire

[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:44.900]
That's got 165 foot yacht in Juno, Alaska and he's expecting the public to help him build a stadium

[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:49.820]
Because you don't want to lose anyone with a baseball team that nobody forced into buy and then here on the same newspaper

[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:55.020]
They on the front page of the local section is that picture of him sucking a person and Henry will pitch for new stadium in

[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:59.340]
Proud counter planning to be more aggressive and of course wants the attack spares to help him build it

[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.940]
Yes, something baseball is a dying sport. Yeah, it's right. Nobody cares

[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:07.940]
Uh-huh turn out is terrible. All these guys are a bunch of asshole overpaid jocks batting 210

[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:11.280]
Right, it's a bunch of mine because they did all this expansion

[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.180]
What you have is a bunch of minor leaguers in major league uniforms. They're still minor leaguers

[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:21.400]
It's all water down. That's why you've got all these guys hitting the 50 and 60 and 70 home runs now instead of pro player

[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:25.300]
State you should call a pro prospect stadium. There you go. You know, it's ridiculous and Wayne

[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:28.560]
Here's a guy who got a stadium built and the panthers are gonna suck

[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:32.500]
He's an asshole. Yeah, got a hatchet man in there. He don't give a crap

[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:38.560]
He just cares about the bottom line. We know that and he knows unfortunately there enough suckers that keep from that place up

[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.760]
I don't ask me. I can't figure it out and you know something

[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:47.200]
Brian Murray, well, they also go on a boat and and go find Kenney in a middle of the lake, you know

[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.920]
Ridiculous already. Okay. I'll see you

[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.780]
5 6 7 0 5 oh, sorry 5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:57.540]
0 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:59.800]
She wants you start doing that. It's hard to stop

[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.720]
That's why we had to get dinner to be tired because

[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:05.500]
The spokesman you couldn't chase you should really anymore. You got tired of sharing that

[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:06.900]
very embarrassing

[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:09.440]
Here's for a lot of Dale. Hello

[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.400]
Yes

[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:17.040]
From Lennon clock until 10 o'clock when they went off here this morning the entire count is any reason why you're whispering or

[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.520]
Want that work? Oh

[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:22.780]
Was

[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.160]
the Millennium start

[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:26.940]
and

[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:31.460]
In 2000 or 2000. Who are we talking about? Who's the day Rick Riley

[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:37.680]
And he insisted that it was 2000 and everybody else around him kept telling him 2001

[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:42.260]
Yeah, he spent an entire hour on it. There's only about seven eight weeks ago. We did that in the show exactly

[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.700]
Recreally is a douchebag. Okay. Thanks for the good news

[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:51.280]
But a genius. Oh great mathematician. You know, it's interesting because he likes to fancy himself a computer expert

[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.260]
And I've told you this before but when we were over at PAX and we had all that fancy equipment

[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:59.000]
Nobody know how to make it work and the computers kept breaking down crashing all the time

[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.180]
And he had more trouble with them than anybody

[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.980]
Remember that couldn't get anything straight enough. He's supposed to be the expert

[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:08.520]
Of course, I know that if I want to buy some stocks. I'll call up Rick

[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:14.560]
56705 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T line. Here's North Miami. Hello

[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:21.320]
Neil yes, sir. Hey, long time listener. All right. All right. Hey, I'm buying my time in day county right now

[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:27.420]
Ready to move on out. Yeah, but anyway, do you see Matt Merrick star. I'm on TV last night. No, I did not

[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:31.080]
I wouldn't watch Merrick's oh my god. I'm like a book. I don't need to see him again

[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.260]
Unbelievable. Pitchin for this penny sales tax

[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:38.880]
But I hope I hope it loses like four to one. I hope it loses so overwhelming

[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:45.260]
That it's such a massive rejection and impudiation by the people of this county who've been led down the garden path so many times before

[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:49.900]
The Merrick's deer hind packs his bags and goes back out to LA or wherever he went to the first time

[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:54.300]
And don't ever show his ugly pusher again. I just hope I just hope it it shows the county government

[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:55.840]
It's such an overwhelming

[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.900]
thing that people just

[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:02.080]
Vote for it against it and it puts in embarrassment in them

[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.740]
And God bless you so and vote early and often before we leave

[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:09.420]
Those absentee ballots there's always coming handy

[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:14.660]
Yeah, even from the dead people especially in Miami. Let's get to all those people that voted for mayor Suarez

[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:16.660]
former mayor Suarez

[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.460]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on I mean how much energy do you take to say no?

[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:24.560]
You know, I mean yes, that requires a little bit more

[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.880]
You know like listen. Yeah, see that requires some energy, but no hey, that's the simple

[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:35.140]
So like Nancy Reagan said just say no to the Crookson-Dade County in the mayor that belongs behind bars

[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:38.960]
For trying to defraud the public for the umpteenth time

[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:45.060]
Here's North Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil. Yes, I am long time listener. All right

[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:51.340]
I don't understand how can you be talking about cigars today when different Kennedy claims being buried

[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.040]
How who can be you do you supposed to garish

[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:01.880]
Meaning what? What does that mean? Well, I don't know you know a nice guy a Kennedy family the

[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.580]
Family

[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.240]
We're reading an article about it sir. I just got through reading an article. Yeah, I heard it

[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:13.620]
Well, what would you like to talk about I'd like to talk about why are you not talking about the national uh-huh

[01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:18.690]
He'd like to talk about why I'm not talking about the Hebrew queers. Whatever it was that he said

[01:12:18.690 --> 01:12:23.710]
What do you say five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[01:12:25.330 --> 01:12:30.550]
Here's the lenient Ford Lauderdale. Hello. Neil. Yes, ma'am. How are you today great? That's good

[01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:36.070]
I got a couple things first of all um my husband and I we both are saddened by the fact that John Kennedy died

[01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:40.770]
But we're not overwhelmed we've walked very little with the coverage and it's like

[01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:45.970]
Barium let's move on that's the first second story. They've already been cremated all three of them

[01:12:45.970 --> 01:12:47.450]
They put their ashes out to see now

[01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:53.050]
Why can't we move on with life and like this last asshole this last bigoted knee-endrathol

[01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:55.310]
I saw why I just got through reading this four-page

[01:12:56.170 --> 01:13:02.390]
Stangle which is a great article and some that up more eloquently than I ever could and why can't we now move on and stop trying to live some

[01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:06.010]
Vicarious life through somebody famous in Goodsey it's because like you said

[01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:08.610]
He's always gonna be steps for your little boy

[01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:13.070]
So living to his father's coffin to people. I mean I was three years old when Kennedy died

[01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:16.890]
But I and I have memories in my mom dark house four days in a row

[01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:23.010]
But he's always gonna be that little three-year-old and let's face it how many pictures that you've seen as him as that three-year-old or under the desk

[01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:25.690]
It's just the way people want to remember him and that's it

[01:13:25.690 --> 01:13:28.090]
But now I need you guys not the way I remember him

[01:13:28.090 --> 01:13:33.170]
Well, no, it isn't you probably not and there's really I mean he hadn't had a chance if he was gonna make us mark

[01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:35.630]
As a Kennedy he hadn't done it yet

[01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:38.510]
So the only thing you have to remember him by is when he was little

[01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:44.790]
Here and and that's what why is that I don't know we saw his picture eight million times whether we wanted to see or not on the front

[01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:50.230]
Every guy there magazine we saw eight billion words about George magazine, which was a money losing proposition

[01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:56.490]
Very weak circulation to 400,000 readers. Oh, I don't I don't get that I we don't either

[01:13:56.490 --> 01:14:02.030]
We really talk about living in the pan. You know why you know why in an addition which most people in the society

[01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:06.070]
Most of the people in this audience don't remember him saluting the casket

[01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:10.850]
Don't remember him sitting under the guy dim a desk in the oval office because they weren't born then

[01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:16.050]
See and that but you know what if you if you weren't born and I like I say I was I was three when Kennedy was

[01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:20.130]
Assessinated that's your first memory whether it happens when you're seven or eight

[01:14:20.130 --> 01:14:22.910]
That's the first thing you remember when you start hearing about oh

[01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:27.970]
Prevented and assassinated is you see those pictures of John John underneath the desk saluting the casket

[01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:33.790]
He's a Kennedy that's and and with the name Kennedy goes certain rights and privileges as society

[01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:38.370]
So in other words, so in other words when David Kennedy dried out of a drug overdose dead where there was a big deal about

[01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:41.350]
She were rehashing the same stuff again. That's not true. I

[01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:47.670]
True you're you're you're absolutely right. I guess when Michael Kennedy had the skiing accident and died and skis

[01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:52.250]
The the guy that was diddling the babysitter he there was no big son at answer about that

[01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:54.290]
It didn't last two minutes to coverage about that

[01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:56.370]
Is as much of a Kennedy is anybody else?

[01:14:56.510 --> 01:15:00.090]
It wasn't romanticized and John John was always or John Kennedy Jr

[01:15:00.090 --> 01:15:08.970]
Will always be a romanticized figure in most people's minds because he was related to who John what was John the president of the United States of America?

[01:15:09.450 --> 01:15:11.350]
Yeah, I don't know. I don't understand it either

[01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:15.610]
But I need to change the subject for one quick second and after you ever

[01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:16.070]
Please

[01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:22.750]
Have you ever considered going to stay on the eastern the Adriatic coast in Italy?

[01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:25.370]
No, no it's too close to Yugoslavia

[01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:32.610]
I really because it did some beautiful little towns all along that right along the Adriatic. No. Oh well. All right. Have a great day

[01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:35.230]
Stay out from under that desk

[01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:40.170]
5 670 560. I mean you know you're you're doing your thing man

[01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:43.770]
I mean you think whatever you think and that's fine. I just uh all I can say

[01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:49.690]
20 before noon at 560 wqa. I'm I'll tell you that guy that called before about fish food

[01:15:49.690 --> 01:15:52.630]
I mean what is there to really say you know it's the best ice cream that's ever been invented?

[01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:57.190]
All right. This is G Gordon Lydia and they don't come any worse than Neil Roger

[01:15:57.190 --> 01:15:57.810]
oh

[01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:03.950]
I can't wait I don't know

[01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:08.090]
I play for no go up the road

[01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:12.790]
I feel my back. He floats

[01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:16.810]
Yeah, I hate to tell you so

[01:16:17.370 --> 01:16:17.410]
I

[01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:21.230]
can't wait I gotta go

[01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:25.490]
I'm back now on my hands and knees

[01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:29.610]
Let's together tightly squeeze

[01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:33.690]
You best go over in this bath

[01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:38.250]
Or I don't use that messy cat

[01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:42.370]
So in the bladder we'll explore

[01:16:44.530 --> 01:16:44.970]
I

[01:16:44.970 --> 01:16:46.750]
Can't wait I call it down

[01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:52.010]
Squared squirt 14 till noon at 560 you mean it's not even 12 o'clock yet. No only crap

[01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:55.370]
But I'm enjoying this predominant square and even though it's not lit up

[01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:57.590]
I'm just oh I shouldn't be keeping it in my mouth isn't that right?

[01:16:57.630 --> 01:17:00.870]
Is that what they said before? Don't keep chewing on it and the cigar either

[01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:05.710]
5 670 560 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:10.290]
Here's Miami. Hello. You know yes sir. Hey doing okay. Yeah

[01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:16.370]
My girlfriend walked in and she's sad because they're putting John John's ashes in the sea

[01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:20.810]
There's not gonna be a grave site where people can go and visit thank God

[01:17:22.190 --> 01:17:25.430]
Maybe she's just maybe she can just throw some flowers in the Atlantic

[01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:30.590]
In fact, maybe all the transatlantic flights what they can do for the next several months is just kind of as easy

[01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:36.570]
You're taking off just crack the window a little bit or maybe just open the door just a little of crack and let everybody go up to the front and

[01:17:36.570 --> 01:17:39.270]
Drop some flowers out before you get sucked out of the plane

[01:17:39.970 --> 01:17:42.450]
I agree hey a couple things

[01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:47.010]
This penny sales tax is there they are they've done any surveys?

[01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:51.530]
This is a kind of concrete package. What is it to see what to see whether it's likely to pass?

[01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:54.790]
I have no idea whether they have there any polls. They're probably sitting on them

[01:17:54.790 --> 01:18:00.270]
Okay, and and one other thing I try to call you about this a few days ago is it a pay phone a pay phone crap out

[01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:01.510]
I got a buddy

[01:18:02.610 --> 01:18:07.030]
He's 33 years old and he he just married a 16 year old girl

[01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:14.630]
Last year he just turned 16 and you know he loves her very much. I'm not making light of any of that of course

[01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:16.370]
But it seems with these

[01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:21.510]
Dirtway rape wise that you know as long as you have the blessing of the Lord through marriage

[01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:26.750]
You can you can be bang in 13 year old I guess. I don't know really what I mean how does that one was too bad?

[01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:30.590]
Roman Polanski didn't know that I have no idea. I don't know how that works, but maybe somebody does

[01:18:31.210 --> 01:18:35.790]
Well, it's just interesting. I just want to run that by I knew I have a good day. Thanks for the good news

[01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:43.270]

[01:18:49.450 --> 01:18:55.150]
How about this stadium? They're never gonna build no baseball stadium. I sure hope not of course not to joke

[01:18:55.610 --> 01:19:01.390]
They'll never build a baseball stadium in Miami. Why do you in Miami? What about in Broward? Never how do you know that?

[01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:06.610]
Because two years from now, there'd be no more baseball on South Florida. I don't that's really hard. You're wrong

[01:19:07.170 --> 01:19:13.910]
6,000 people at the game. Yeah, yeah, there's no people at the game. Well, I got one you have no payroll, but there is a make

Jackass five six seven oh five sixty. See, you know people ask me what I do for a living

[01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:36.610]
I tell them I do a talk show on the radio and say well, what kind of talk she was that I said I talked to assholes for four hours every day

[01:19:36.610 --> 01:19:41.630]
No, I tell people that I actually what I say is I talked to crazy people for four hours every day

[01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:47.550]
I don't say asshole because when you first meet somebody strange around a plane you don't want to say asshole because they might take it personally, you know

[01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:51.970]
No, I always tell them that I talked to crazy people for hours every day

[01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:54.470]
Is that what I get paid for? Yes

[01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:59.670]
So thanks for not letting me down by the way, especially this last guy

[01:20:00.190 --> 01:20:04.330]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:06.430]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:16.370]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line as we continue the search for the ultimate truths of the universe and I'll guarantee you'll fight him right on talk radio

[01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:19.990]
Make no mistake about that. Are we fighting him today? Uh-huh. You bet

[01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:24.950]
Here's a mobile invoker. Hello, Neil God. Yes, sir

[01:20:26.050 --> 01:20:26.830]
This new

[01:20:27.450 --> 01:20:34.050]
Voice of the Panthers digs. Oh, I finally got a call on this two hours later when I get a call on jigs big dot

[01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:38.030]
Which most people here don't know him from old McDonald's well, he is old well

[01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:47.210]
I only read the um in the papers falling about him. I have never heard him. Is it fair to compare him to let's say rumour?

[01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:51.010]
Oh rumours better than jigs McDonald. Yes. Yeah

[01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:56.550]
And could this McDonald's person do television or is he strictly radio?

[01:20:57.230 --> 01:21:03.090]
He has on television. He did he did mostly TV in the past. Oh, but here he's gonna be strictly radio. Right

[01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:04.770]
Okay, he's weak

[01:21:05.230 --> 01:21:05.810]
He's weak

[01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:11.150]
He's old. He's old and he's boring. He's got to I mean he's not I mean he's better than Chris Moore

[01:21:11.150 --> 01:21:14.530]
Which is okay, but he certainly doesn't make the game exciting

[01:21:14.530 --> 01:21:21.790]
He's not gonna create any new hockey fans. He's uh old and worn out. He's a burnout. No, Lord the Panthers could have done better. Yes

[01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:26.910]
Very good. I listen to I listened to some of the tapes that they had a couple of tapes

[01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:28.650]
And you know if they weren't gonna give it to guilty

[01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:31.010]
There were some other guys that had more experience than guilty

[01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:34.630]
And we had some tapes from great people some really good announcers

[01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:40.390]
So instead of bringing in somebody new they bring back an old tired guy because he's got this incestuous relationship from Bill Tory

[01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:42.970]
From a hundred years ago when the New York with the islanders

[01:21:42.970 --> 01:21:48.170]
And so that's why they're bringing him in here. It's very very sad. Hey lives off the coast too. He's gonna place up a hutch in

[01:21:48.170 --> 01:21:49.410]
To the island right yeah

[01:21:50.610 --> 01:21:55.650]
Well, all remains to be well at least you won't have far to go when we send him home. You guys have a great third pal. Okay

[01:21:56.630 --> 01:22:00.110]
And like I said, it's not personally. He's a good guy, but he just sucks

[01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:07.910]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the ATC mediocrity. We love mediocrity here

[01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:13.370]
That's what this town is generally based on that's what Wayne is all about those same boring guys

[01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:17.650]
They all look like Dean Jordan. They all smell like Dean Jordan. They all have those same boring

[01:22:17.650 --> 01:22:22.290]
Uh, I don't even know what the color of that suit. He had one suit that he always used to wear before he ran

[01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:24.530]
Off to wherever he went to the Charlotte or somewhere

[01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:29.850]
Kind of like a brindle brown. They all have that same kind of dull

[01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:31.070]
like that

[01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:36.890]
And that's the high pingo organization and of course John Henry he ain't no different

[01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:42.410]
Just so that he just don't want to be just another guy who wanted to play toy because he's got a lot of money

[01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:45.410]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:49.770]
Neil yes sir god speaking if you are good

[01:22:50.690 --> 01:22:56.410]
If you are god you will not allow that little Leo the caprio to be on the next godfather

[01:22:56.410 --> 01:23:01.810]
The next guy I hate to break the news to you but Mario Puzo died there isn't gonna be any next godfather. Have a nice day

[01:23:03.610 --> 01:23:06.890]
To these people read a newspaper. Oh, they listen to a news can

[01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:12.230]
I'm then wondering how dropping the ashes from cremated bodies in the ocean other than that do they ever know

[01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:17.190]
Get with it get with it. Wake up and sniff the daffodils. Okay

[01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:25.390]
Mario Puzo is dead. Oh, let me say it again. That was just a couple of weeks ago

[01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:30.890]
A man who had a much greater impact on most of our lives

[01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:41.950]
Am I right about that godfather parts one two and three one of the classic epic of motion picture and also of course the book was even better than the movie which he wrote

[01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:48.990]
Did anybody make a big sentence about that just barely got any mention

[01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:53.410]
Mario Puzo. I mean he wasn't a good looking young guy

[01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:56.310]
He wasn't on the picture of a cover of glamour magazines

[01:23:57.910 --> 01:24:01.310]
And of course Puzo he was one of those grease balls, you know

[01:24:03.150 --> 01:24:06.590]
Which I thought we like grease balls. I do. I like the Italians. What's wrong with that?

[01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:13.910]
Love the Italians just like that senator from Nevada said the Italians are great people and I got to go now because

[01:24:14.490 --> 01:24:16.270]
My hook is waiting in the motel

[01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:19.170]
You know that senator won't see him no more

[01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:22.270]
So

[01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:26.170]
That's like what's the point I see I feel like I got stuck into this again the same thing

[01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:29.230]
I've been doing the other three days and I keep rehashing like I'm trying to convince people

[01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:33.290]
I'm not going to convince them. I know what the story is. I know which side it's buttered on

[01:24:34.650 --> 01:24:39.970]
But the overwhelming majority of people out there. It's the it's the America of the 90s. That's all I know

[01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:43.390]
Is whatever television teaches them is important. That's important

[01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:45.710]
And that woman before that was hawking a trident

[01:24:45.710 --> 01:24:50.450]
I don't know what she was talking about about she was three years old then but she remembers those pictures of John John

[01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:53.270]
Is saluting and under the desk

[01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:55.970]
How can you be three years old and you remember that

[01:24:58.090 --> 01:25:04.730]
I don't remember anything from when I was three years old. You the earliest memories I have was when I fell down and hit my head when I was five years old

[01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:09.690]
And I still have the scar in my forehead in Rochester on okay terrorists in the first house we live in I fell down on the

[01:25:10.190 --> 01:25:13.870]
The rocks we had like a real rocky thing outside our side door

[01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:15.590]
I fell down and hit my head and here's the scar

[01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:20.570]
That's it. That's the earliest memory I've got. I remember chasing ducks with a squircon

[01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:25.370]
And then I remember carrying that cat up the street on okay terrorists the one that

[01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:28.850]
My arms and I've hated cats ever since. Yeah, I didn't number right in my arms

[01:25:29.710 --> 01:25:31.850]
And I've had in the version to pussy you've ever since

[01:25:34.050 --> 01:25:36.430]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello

[01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:38.210]
Hey, now, how's your great?

[01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:42.070]
I don't blame John Henry or Heisenger any of these guys

[01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:46.710]
I blame the politicians in the public if they would just stand up and say look no

[01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:50.790]
Using any money that's it because Henry he's just getting a free lunch

[01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:52.630]
How can you turn down a free meal?

[01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:57.890]
This is the same guy who said that if the public wouldn't build it he would build so let's tell him put up her shut up

[01:25:57.890 --> 01:26:00.390]
Okay, you want to keep your crappy team here fine

[01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:04.650]
So you said you'd build a thing you go ahead you work it out and then you put up the money and leave us alone

[01:26:04.650 --> 01:26:10.290]
Well, that's a great idea, but remember what happened in Arizona the public voted against building the stadium

[01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:16.410]
Yeah, and the commissioners went ahead and did it anyway some guy went into the office and shot the bitch right in the head

[01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:25.790]
That's true. Yeah, and you know, and and that's what it's the public will means nothing because these politicians are sucking up to the rich guys

[01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:30.170]
And unless it means that they're not going to get reelected. That's the only thing they know

[01:26:30.170 --> 01:26:34.470]
I know that if I were wealthy enough to have 165 foot yacht more than Juneau, Alaska

[01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:38.310]
I'd be running around asking the taxpayers. They helped me build a stadium for my play toy

[01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:46.850]
Well, if they do it would you take the money? Yes, yeah, there you go. F&A. Okay. Have a great day. Bye. Bye. That's what they need to learn to start doing next

[01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:52.390]
Next earth is a good day to practice just say no, no, no, no, this the prize makes it so easy. No

[01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:55.710]
Why do you woman out there sure you got a lot of practice? Yeah

[01:26:57.510 --> 01:27:03.210]
56705 60 pound 560 on the 18t line four minutes till noon here in Death Valley days and it is man

[01:27:03.210 --> 01:27:06.690]
It is so deadly you can smell it you can feel it

[01:27:08.530 --> 01:27:11.490]
I can tell you wheels have been returning

[01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:16.570]
Thinking that way back for them

[01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:22.010]
Travel back to the 1660

[01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:26.790]
Gonna get it on Joe Batman again now watching

[01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:40.150]
Now we heard the three of us

[01:27:40.150 --> 01:27:46.290]
Now we heard it for just a few days now

[01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:50.390]
Now I hope all you will remember

[01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:57.170]
The thousand man gets all the chicks they have

[01:27:58.650 --> 01:28:01.070]
It's not as long as ours

[01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:05.510]
Weird as hell that is true

[01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:10.110]
It's all about

[01:28:15.970 --> 01:28:21.170]
I see probably one at five sixty wqm we got 1600 open lines on him

[01:28:21.170 --> 01:28:25.210]
But that's okay. We're rolling along. We're already halfway up the hill and now it's all downhill from here

[01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:32.010]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line gym and yeah for the vacationing Hank Goldberg at two

[01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:36.950]
I'll tell you one thing. I think snow dummy. He sure knows when to get out of here as often as possible

[01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:39.170]
Here's a mobile in north Miami. Hello

[01:28:39.170 --> 01:28:41.070]
Yeah, I was going on. Yes, sir

[01:28:41.710 --> 01:28:46.250]
Screw the candy. You know, I mean it's funny because if I you know if I had listened to you

[01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:50.290]
I think all this stuff going on is normal how they're carrying on carrying on carrying on

[01:28:50.290 --> 01:28:53.870]
It is so sick and so disgusting and it's still going on right now

[01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:58.830]
They won't let it go there putting the ashes in the ocean and they still won't let go of it

[01:28:58.830 --> 01:29:04.790]
How much more is there to say they're dead? It's tragic. It was an accident. They're dead. Good people die every day

[01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:06.310]
Let them rest in peace

[01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:12.930]
Funny I get a neighbor you know to chick was obsessed with Leo the caprio and obsessed with everything that you know

[01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:15.750]
I'm eating that's going on the media and that she's all next door crying

[01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:23.170]
Well the kind the kind of people the kind of simple things who are obsessed with Leo the caprio

[01:29:23.170 --> 01:29:28.990]
Those are the people right now who are crying and carrying on like this is something important because those are morons

[01:29:28.990 --> 01:29:30.610]
Exactly another thing

[01:29:30.610 --> 01:29:35.350]
What are these all these people that are crying for this new stadium? I mean do you need these people out of kids?

[01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:40.850]
These people realize how over kinds of schools are and how over kinds of the jails are they don't care about that

[01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:45.990]
It's nothing but you better get you better get your priorities straight mr. We don't care about that

[01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:50.190]
It's amazing. That's right. Um, did you ever find all this picture brown?

[01:29:50.630 --> 01:29:53.570]
I ever find one all the things around no

[01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:57.310]
Um, can you play uh father of fool? Okay, we'll do it

[01:29:57.310 --> 01:30:01.190]
See I say hi to father or tool at the bottom of the pool. Oh, that was bad

[01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:05.450]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line

[01:30:06.670 --> 01:30:07.650]
Here's bokeh. Hello

[01:30:08.890 --> 01:30:14.190]
Neil yes, sir. Hey, I just heard you guys talk about jigs and thawnals. I had a question about that

[01:30:14.190 --> 01:30:17.950]
Yes, sir. Is he still uh, is diny potton still gonna be doing an amthing?

[01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:24.090]
Yeah, on tv potpans with rimmeron tv. Oh, so jigs is doing the radio is doing the radio and I assume that

[01:30:24.090 --> 01:30:28.230]
Randy molars still be doing the color and gildy will be like doing whatever does he does on the broadcast

[01:30:28.770 --> 01:30:30.590]
Okay, cuz I just caught part of it on the radio

[01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:32.270]
Well, what do you think of jigs? McDonald, do you like him?

[01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:34.770]
Uh, grew up on long island watching him

[01:30:34.770 --> 01:30:38.450]
So I know what he's like. I know he could be a real bore sometime

[01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:41.690]
Uh, but you know, I was just wondering if he was gonna be working with potvin

[01:30:41.690 --> 01:30:45.730]
Maybe there'd be some chemistry there, but I guess if he's on the radio and that he's on the radio

[01:30:45.730 --> 01:30:50.270]
I've got to use for a suit. They could bring in 50 gallons of sulfuric acid and stick it in diny's potpan

[01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:53.650]
Braco and there still wouldn't be any chemistry, okay? He is terminal

[01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:58.990]
If you look up the word dollared if you looked at dumb frog in the dictionary, you'll see his picture next to it

[01:30:59.490 --> 01:31:01.070]
And have a great thing all right nil

[01:31:04.210 --> 01:31:05.970]
5670560 I shouldn't have said that you know

[01:31:06.730 --> 01:31:09.990]
Because then he sees very sensitive. I feel really really

[01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:11.010]
I'm sorry

[01:31:13.030 --> 01:31:16.270]
5670560 pound 560 on a mobile one line. We're waiting on your baby

[01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:18.870]
We're waiting on the 50 million calls that are gonna come in here

[01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:22.210]
And you know what the problem is this week? I guess I really uh

[01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:26.030]
I lost my senses this week. I should have come on here and done the popular thing

[01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:31.750]
See when I come on and I say what is I think I don't care whether it's popular on popular means stream

[01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:33.950]
Whatever I do is say what I think

[01:31:34.630 --> 01:31:38.770]
But I guess I should have probably sucked up to everybody and just gone right into this thing

[01:31:38.770 --> 01:31:45.010]
Oh my god the Kennedys and Camelot and what a tragedy this is and how are we gonna survive and this young man

[01:31:45.010 --> 01:31:48.170]
Certainly would have been a senator and probably the next president and yeah

[01:31:48.170 --> 01:31:51.870]
I should have just come on and bullcrafted everybody because that's where that's where all the money is

[01:31:52.650 --> 01:31:54.290]
That's where the popularity is

[01:31:55.450 --> 01:31:58.990]
Is going in there with the mainstream and just sucking on to everybody's button fine

[01:31:58.990 --> 01:32:03.890]
I was you know it reminds me of I was thinking about this this morning driving the work. I don't know what made me think about it

[01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:13.370]
About people who think that their hip or cool. Oh, I know what it was. I saw a thing on tv and actually the first time I ever actually saw it in print

[01:32:15.150 --> 01:32:18.390]
SUP which is not short for supper. Okay, for all you old parts out there

[01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:22.970]
You know it used to be what's up and then if we came TSUP sup and out it's just

[01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:25.430]
SUP so if you really want to be hip and cool

[01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:31.230]
You have to keep up with the latest lingo from all these degenerates out there on the street all these eliterates

[01:32:31.230 --> 01:32:33.410]
And it's the same thing with shaken hands

[01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:36.470]
See I don't know about you, but I'm one of those people

[01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:40.530]
I learned a long time ago that when you shake your hand you stick your hand out somebody else puts their hand

[01:32:40.530 --> 01:32:45.630]
You squeeze it a little bit not too much no finger and they're a palm and that's it. That's how you shake some of these hands

[01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:48.590]
Not anymore and if you want sports

[01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:55.950]
This is the best one. Okay, because air be five minutes even within a baseball game between the first thing and the ninth inning

[01:32:55.950 --> 01:33:02.190]
They have developed some new way the high five low five they got the fist on the fifth and a hand on your wrist and a hand in your neck

[01:33:02.190 --> 01:33:03.650]
I mean I'm sorry

[01:33:03.650 --> 01:33:06.950]
I can't yeah the elbow on the elbow the elbow on your neck

[01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:11.890]
I can't keep up. I have no desire to keep up. I'm not interested in the drug brothers grip

[01:33:11.890 --> 01:33:15.450]
You know, I know I watch I watch young people shake hands

[01:33:16.230 --> 01:33:19.710]
And I ask myself how is it that they know when they're finished?

[01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:24.410]
You know what I'm saying? How do they know when they've done the last thing with a fingers like this and

[01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:28.870]
How do they are are they sure because it all depends on the person that you're shaking the hand with?

[01:33:30.330 --> 01:33:35.710]
How hip and how cool they are and what happens if they're hip or encoder than you are then you look like a jackass

[01:33:38.430 --> 01:33:41.710]
And you know something the people who want to be hip and cool they're very sad

[01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:45.550]
Because they're desperate to show to everybody how hip and cool they are

[01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:49.650]
And just like these Prado more of a squared. That's how square they are

[01:33:52.010 --> 01:33:53.570]
Makes me nauseous

[01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:57.890]
Yeah, we got the that that's it. That's one of my favorites with the elbows. That's great

[01:34:00.150 --> 01:34:04.150]

Going once 13 minutes 51 seconds later long gone

[01:34:17.130 --> 01:34:22.510]
Let's try sunrise hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I've been listening on and off this morning because I've been in and out of the house

[01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:22.750]
but

[01:34:23.770 --> 01:34:26.190]
Did anybody talk you about the channel 10

[01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:33.890]
Special to the world to series not called vanished. No tonight is Madeline Murray. Oh here. Yeah, you're gonna talk about her disappearance

[01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:37.530]
Really yeah, what time's that on 10 o'clock? All right, okay

[01:34:37.530 --> 01:34:40.590]
And I would you see there was an article in the paper the other day about some guy that

[01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:47.150]
Where they turned up a bag of like all these gold coins that had belonged to her. Yeah, they copied some

[01:34:47.150 --> 01:34:53.830]
See for petty crook or whatever was arrested and they found these things in his possession and traced them back to her and her son

[01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:59.210]
Right. Oh, yeah, they arrested this guy. They think he put her in a that put all of them in a gigantic oil drama some right

[01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:04.350]
They sleep with the fishes and by the way, are we having any morning about that exactly

[01:35:05.210 --> 01:35:09.090]
Exactly Madeline over here one of the guttiest bitches in the history of the human race

[01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:10.830]
No morning about that

[01:35:11.730 --> 01:35:14.750]
Goes on and on and I agree with you about the handshake. It's totally ludicrous

[01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:17.210]
It's ridiculous man. Let them let them all shake it

[01:35:17.210 --> 01:35:21.690]
But I wanted you to know about that show. Thanks. I appreciate it. God bless you. I'm sorry Madeline would like that

[01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:26.690]
5 6 7 0 5 60 god damn it and pound 5 60 on the mobile one line

[01:35:26.690 --> 01:35:30.830]
Yeah, how cool can you be man? How cool? Okay, hey stop stop

[01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:35.330]
And those those are young people like it sucked into that you know what?

[01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:37.850]
I said to myself every time I listen to that and I hear it

[01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:42.330]
Nothing I'm some old funny that he like George thinks the old man, which is his favorite way to refer to me

[01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:48.770]
What's great love about the way? No, no, that's not the point the point is that all of this other stuff is so superficial

[01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:53.230]
And so meaningless and you know what it means nothing it means absolutely nothing

[01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:57.970]
But you see we have to have we have to separate the generations

[01:35:57.970 --> 01:36:03.750]
We have to have if we don't have a real generation gap we have to invent new ones because it's real good marketing

[01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:09.410]
You know, it's real good that way that if you if you wear a certain kind of clothing if you wear your pants out of your knees

[01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:10.950]
Which I don't mind that by the way

[01:36:12.190 --> 01:36:15.930]
Yeah, that's one of the new styles that's not too bad. Don't like those baggy pants

[01:36:15.930 --> 01:36:21.190]
But if you got them down around your knees, hey, you know what they call that like for the handicap easy access

[01:36:23.230 --> 01:36:24.850]
He is still

[01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:26.630]
Biggest

[01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:28.010]

[01:36:59.930 --> 01:37:05.930]

Still to beat any nation from Australia to my right

[01:37:11.730 --> 01:37:13.930]
You come from everywhere

[01:37:14.570 --> 01:37:16.290]

[01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:21.470]
To play before my surprise and they'll make us go insane

[01:37:22.210 --> 01:37:24.490]
And now they're scoring again

[01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:40.690]
You girls will not be feeling like new y'all stick up like us

[01:37:41.670 --> 01:37:45.990]
No, they're really so down loving the lady soccer

[01:37:46.890 --> 01:37:47.950]
Love in the lady

[01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:54.310]

Well 15 and 560 WQA and 5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:05.350]
Pond 5 60 on a mobile one line we're kicking some serious back to name mostly our own, but that's okay

[01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:07.690]
I'm used to it. Here's Miami. Hello

[01:38:08.330 --> 01:38:09.010]
Yes, sir

[01:38:11.050 --> 01:38:15.350]
Almost to get done my pants on our kicks McDonald is coming here. I grew up

[01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:19.990]
I grew up on in Pennsylvania actually the poke I was watching now when there's a channel man

[01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:25.170]
He's the most boring right the bland the criminal right bland that they sure that's exactly where bland

[01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:29.370]
He's awful putting he actually did work for sports channel when they did the playoffs

[01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:33.990]
I really the worst I've ever heard him it's a tie between him and more yeah

[01:38:34.690 --> 01:38:35.210]
Redful

[01:38:35.210 --> 01:38:43.070]
I'm here in show in gentlemen here are the adjectives used to do an out to describe the new maybe you'll play by playboy

[01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:45.110]
So the path is redful and

[01:38:45.730 --> 01:38:52.050]
Whatever you should just retire. He's a awful. Yeah, I can't believe this in that pathetic and again it goes to show you

[01:38:52.050 --> 01:38:57.870]
It's not your talent. It's who you know and who you suck up to because him in builtory obviously have this incestuous relationship

[01:38:57.870 --> 01:39:00.930]
It's a disgrace that they brought this man here to do this job

[01:39:01.810 --> 01:39:07.830]
I can't really want to listen to compound. What does this compound crap the Kennedy compound? I thought that was for warts

[01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:09.350]
Have a great day pal

[01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.710]
Thank you

[01:39:10.690 --> 01:39:18.070]
Isn't that for warts compound W five six seven oh five sixty Tom five sixty on the mobile one line enough for the frickin

[01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:19.250]
Kennedies, okay

[01:39:20.230 --> 01:39:23.550]
Go get a Kennedy sandwich or something do anything with it

[01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:27.550]
Just leave me alone with a frickin Kennedies and like a you know, I can only imagine

[01:39:28.330 --> 01:39:33.090]
Because you know there are millions of people who despise the Kennedies almost to a point of irrationality

[01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:34.350]
But that's just the way it is

[01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:38.130]
And maybe in some cases justifiably I would like the old man

[01:39:38.770 --> 01:39:41.470]
I can only imagine how those people must feel now

[01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:45.050]
Because of somebody who admired the Kennedies for the most part

[01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:51.070]
Although I think more objectively than most American, but I mean, I'm just grossed out. I'm nauseated

[01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:54.410]
I'm to say that I'm saturated would be an understatement

[01:39:56.890 --> 01:40:01.410]
So the people that despise the Kennedies those people reason we're not hearing from them

[01:40:01.410 --> 01:40:07.030]
They have like checked out they just like John John their under the desk and they're not coming out until the coast is clear

[01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:12.610]
They've got the canvassing over their heads and they're like an ostrich. They got their head buried in the sand

[01:40:12.610 --> 01:40:17.390]
Please, let me know when this is over tap me on the shoulder and I'll come back and get some relief from this

[01:40:18.170 --> 01:40:18.570]
craziness

[01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:22.210]
Here's Miami hello

I want to put my opinion on the Kennedy

[01:40:56.250 --> 01:41:00.810]
Needle from Miami and I would think that

[01:41:00.810 --> 01:41:07.230]
That would happen to me and I got locked in the and to see with a plane to crash. Yeah, uh, they wouldn't they wouldn't even

[01:41:07.230 --> 01:41:10.570]
You wouldn't even acknowledge me that I thought down on the on the

[01:41:10.570 --> 01:41:12.630]
What they probably would do is that the coast guard

[01:41:12.630 --> 01:41:14.610]
Go on say yelts is some of the Cuban rafters

[01:41:14.610 --> 01:41:15.710]
Hey, by the way, while you're out there

[01:41:15.710 --> 01:41:18.930]
Would you look around and see if you can find that guy? I think he's floating around out there somewhere

[01:41:18.930 --> 01:41:23.830]
Even you if you would have been if you would have been in up main and you would have fallen and

[01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:26.230]

Another thing by the way, you know that guy the Rick Hittin front of the stadium

[01:41:35.690 --> 01:41:37.050]
You know what this morning

I was at the government wanted to bring

[01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:43.210]
Uh, an aircraft carrier the John F. Kennedy carrier

[01:41:43.210 --> 01:41:46.590]
They wanted to bring it in and uh, Ted, you know, I don't know

[01:41:46.590 --> 01:41:50.610]
He said no, you don't want to bring it in. I mean imagine that they would have brought the carrier

[01:41:50.610 --> 01:41:56.530]
Yeah, I don't know that we have to spend just to bring it to drop it. That's a flush of 20, you know exactly

[01:41:56.530 --> 01:41:57.750]
It's unbelievable

[01:41:58.670 --> 01:41:59.750]
God bless you sir

[01:41:59.750 --> 01:42:02.670]

William go. Damn. Yeah, that's why I'll take a look at that when they found out that Rimmer and Gellie were Jewish

[01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:12.390]
Of course you think with the name like Goldstein that would know in Gellie's case

[01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:17.870]
But when they found that out they said oops the two ladies are gonna have too much to choose doing Panther games

[01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:20.130]
Forget it never gonna happen. Yeah

[01:43:20.730 --> 01:43:23.770]
That's the only problem good. That's a good point. I never thought about that

[01:43:23.770 --> 01:43:27.590]
Goiam they all look the most glacial organ that they all look at that Dean Jordan

How about the women we heard from any women today? No that crazy lady

What's the call for three times by the way for what? We don't do douchebags for people that have no material. Okay

[01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:56.130]
Want to give me a call and have just a little bit of material fine

[01:43:56.130 --> 01:44:00.930]
But don't try to use my show as a conduit to try to make a simmiss with some jackass friend of yours

[01:44:00.930 --> 01:44:06.870]
Call them up on the phone and say hey you're a jackass you're a douchebag you're an asshole whatever or better yet go knock on their door

[01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:09.610]
And see how far they knock your false teeth flying

[01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:12.490]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[01:44:15.050 --> 01:44:15.370]
Well

[01:44:15.370 --> 01:44:18.490]
I'm telling you I'm just having a bitch of a mobile in Fort Lauderdale

[01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:23.950]
No, oh yeah, well not bad. I hear that strange sound. Thank you very much for waiting by the way

[01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:25.690]
We got a real patient crowd today

[01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:29.170]
Oh the cigar I keep chewing on it

[01:44:29.790 --> 01:44:33.890]
You know something I am going to line up with a bad thing because I'm chewing on this all day is kind of a protest

[01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:36.090]
Since nobody else out there cares about this

[01:44:36.630 --> 01:44:42.990]
That the FTC wants to clamp down on cigars and put all kind of warnings and make illegal radio and TV advertising the cigars

[01:44:42.990 --> 01:44:48.570]
I mean as much as we love nicks and they love us if they should do that

[01:44:48.570 --> 01:44:54.650]
So nicks will survive and we'll survive we got a waiting list of people are one advertised if that it's not from a self-restant point like that

[01:44:56.150 --> 01:45:01.230]
It's just that when you finally get tired of your government regulating your life every single damn thing

[01:45:01.230 --> 01:45:06.070]
We do and then the things where they ought to be doing more regulation like the god damn diet of the American public

[01:45:06.090 --> 01:45:09.650]
They're liking La La land. Oh yeah, well, we're too busy for that

[01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:16.070]
Of course, we got the president who eats to McDonald's all the time is big max and but he does love his cigars. Welcome

[01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:22.010]
Here's a mobile in Marco Island. Hello. Hi. How you doing pretty good sir? Good

[01:45:22.610 --> 01:45:24.070]
About these secret handshake

[01:45:24.930 --> 01:45:29.170]
When I was in the military are they secret? I thought only the motions of that I don't know

[01:45:29.170 --> 01:45:33.270]
But when I was in the military in the 70s when a couple of the brothers would get together

[01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:36.330]
I thought they were dancing because they were going through this ritual of yeah

[01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:41.370]
Getting their chest and hitting their pants together and pointing and they call it chopping

[01:45:41.370 --> 01:45:44.430]
I think or something to start like that, but I thought it was some kind of a

[01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:49.670]
Secret ritual. I don't know. They're chopping on it. They were chopping on it. Yes, sir. They were

[01:45:50.570 --> 01:45:51.370]
Another thing

[01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:56.670]
They keep saying chop all the time. Yeah, chop on this. Yeah, uh-huh

[01:45:56.670 --> 01:46:02.890]
Corey saving update. I will let the call you a couple weeks ago, but apparently he's working for Fox 4 and he's doing the

[01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:08.570]
Roasting reporter thing and he had a a story on an adult

[01:46:09.310 --> 01:46:09.610]
gay

[01:46:09.610 --> 01:46:10.870]
Needless camp

[01:46:12.190 --> 01:46:19.890]
Near-for-mires and he and he looks shit shot trying to talk to the whole man trying to talk to this old man

[01:46:19.890 --> 01:46:25.050]
It came to the trailer naked of work. Yeah, sir

[01:46:25.050 --> 01:46:27.090]
Shock is what he said. Yeah

[01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:36.110]
One thing about beautiful Marco Isle and about your government influencing people on Marco Isle and if you have ground owls on your fake

[01:46:36.110 --> 01:46:37.350]
I've caught the

[01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:40.230]
Environmentalists come down and they put little

[01:46:40.730 --> 01:46:45.090]
Fakes in the ground and orange barricade tape all around it and tell you that

[01:46:45.090 --> 01:46:51.210]
They will persecute you to death if you decide to build a house and those lockings ground owls are protected. Yeah

[01:46:51.730 --> 01:46:52.130]
On

[01:46:53.770 --> 01:46:58.530]
Okay, I know we got a little problem there. It's that phone five six seven oh five sixty

[01:46:58.530 --> 01:47:02.550]
Mom maybe the phone is screwed up again. They we just haven't figured it out yet. That certainly could be couldn't it?

[01:47:02.690 --> 01:47:04.970]
Happen many times before and there's such a cheap ass joint

[01:47:06.430 --> 01:47:11.070]
And by the way pizza loss bringing food tomorrow. They don't know it yet because junior wants food from pizza left tomorrow

[01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:13.630]
What

[01:47:14.490 --> 01:47:16.270]
Junior your best close personal

[01:47:16.270 --> 01:47:16.750]
Oh

[01:47:17.670 --> 01:47:22.630]
Don't be messing with him. He's taking enough group. You know, I'm gonna tell you the scene that I saw here yesterday

[01:47:23.230 --> 01:47:26.470]
With this Chris Reed business the nephew. I mean he's

[01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:31.730]
I'm not gonna say he's not a bad guy because at this point of the game. I'm just I wonder about these people

[01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:36.010]
All these little children that run around here and when the boss is out of town

[01:47:36.010 --> 01:47:38.510]
Which he had to come flying back for a tragedy for somebody's funeral

[01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:44.330]
But nevertheless and then they're running around here bossing around all the little people including the interns who don't even get paid

[01:47:46.730 --> 01:47:57.330]
I can't stand that I can't stomach it. We got pipsqueaks around here who in their own mind because through a relation or through because they're part of the inner circle or because they have dinner at Greg's house

[01:47:57.330 --> 01:48:03.250]
Right away they're trying to like impress us all with the tremendous power and authority they've got there's still pipsqueaks

[01:48:05.230 --> 01:48:06.810]
That was pathetic

[01:48:08.450 --> 01:48:08.890]
pathetic

[01:48:10.230 --> 01:48:12.750]
I didn't hear the story. I don't I can't either drop in there

[01:48:13.850 --> 01:48:17.790]
evidently when junior was screened in the calls on Hank show one day a few days ago

[01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:21.450]
He had somebody call in who became very abusive because you want you know how they screen

[01:48:21.450 --> 01:48:26.110]
He wanted to talk about the the cycling the big whatever the hell they call that and

[01:48:26.110 --> 01:48:28.910]
Aller's getting abusive. I don't believe so yeah, right

[01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:30.790]
And so anyway to make a long story short

[01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:31.570]
He tried to say well

[01:48:31.570 --> 01:48:36.310]
We don't want to talk about the Hank didn't know nothing about that as I'm on talk about and a guy became very abusive and more abusive

[01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:40.910]
And then start using the effort and a few and the mom and everything and so finally he gave it back to him

[01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:44.010]
And finally cut him off after taking much too much abuse

[01:48:45.550 --> 01:48:47.530]
Chris Reed comes in over a little bit later

[01:48:47.530 --> 01:48:51.110]
Who was the one that screened a call took that call because obviously he had gotten the call

[01:48:51.110 --> 01:48:55.070]
Well, that's a good friend of mine who happens to be a sponsor on his station and you can't those people are

[01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:57.270]
That's our customers you can't treat them like that

[01:48:59.110 --> 01:49:03.730]
So another is Chris Reed notion of screening calls on the show is that you guys the people are screening the cult

[01:49:03.730 --> 01:49:05.530]
She's take a lot of crap from the callers

[01:49:07.730 --> 01:49:08.050]
I

[01:49:08.050 --> 01:49:12.030]
Tell you what all the people are want to abuse will put him right through the underlying Chris okay

[01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:15.910]
We'll get a direct line and you sit in there say oh yes, sir. Yes, or whatever you say yes, sir

[01:49:17.930 --> 01:49:21.790]
Yeah, let's get his direct line and we'll put them all through to him all the people who want to be abusive

[01:49:23.710 --> 01:49:25.010]
Pick it on the interns

[01:49:27.690 --> 01:49:28.510]
Isn't that pathetic

[01:49:29.590 --> 01:49:33.630]
Just like our program director don't have the balls to look anybody in the face and say anything

[01:49:33.630 --> 01:49:38.750]
All or course if he does have an altercation he'll suspend somebody for today because just she Terry Murray would like this place

[01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:39.730]
It's like ding dong school

[01:49:40.590 --> 01:49:44.750]
In my life. I've never worked in a radio station where so many people were being suspended

[01:49:45.930 --> 01:49:51.650]
Like it like a silly place like a kitty place. Oh gee you picked your nose and a that we're gonna suspend you for two days

[01:49:52.630 --> 01:49:54.310]
Yeah, but how was it?

[01:49:57.310 --> 01:50:02.390]
In theaters now from the director of Star Trek and the producer of this spy who shag me

[01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:07.830]

Hey, you the spy who shags spot. So we're shag now or shall we shag myself?

[01:50:30.450 --> 01:50:35.570]
I wonder what star fleet command will say about that in long and prosper. Yeah baby

[01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:42.990]
Pufferty two at five sixty wqa mgm and four hanket two and we got the donny baseball talking the crap at six

[01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:08.350]
All summer long here's Kendall hello

[01:51:09.490 --> 01:51:10.970]
I knew yes sir

[01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:12.730]
Sir I want to know

[01:51:12.730 --> 01:51:20.850]
Does anybody care about the set family or really just cares about the about the goddamn ketties nobody say anything else about about the other families involved in the

[01:51:20.850 --> 01:51:22.710]
They don't have that kind of money or power man

[01:51:23.170 --> 01:51:28.270]
Yeah, I mean I mean all you hear on the news is the spada s rick sent just talking about the

[01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:33.150]
The canadi's and the canadi's this and the canadi's that and nobody cares about the the set family

[01:51:33.150 --> 01:51:35.030]
Wasn't that proved my point right there?

[01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:40.330]
Because they don't own a huge compound on some boring island out in the middle of nowhere exactly

[01:51:40.330 --> 01:51:42.090]
Yeah, I just want to say

[01:51:42.510 --> 01:51:46.570]
I don't want to congratulate you Neil and thank you for speaking the truth and have a great life

[01:51:46.570 --> 01:51:50.410]
Yeah, well, you know rick sent just can relate to it because Mary joker peckney

[01:51:50.410 --> 01:51:53.850]
She had a little car problem there too just like they either rick hit on in front of the stadium

[01:51:54.450 --> 01:51:56.470]
So he can relate to that whole situation I guess

[01:51:57.450 --> 01:52:00.870]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line

[01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:05.470]
No, I took the wrong tactic like him and then I actually said what I thought all week long and that was a bad mistake

[01:52:06.250 --> 01:52:11.170]
You have to suck up to the masses out there and put on a big phony act and come in and we put carry on

[01:52:11.170 --> 01:52:13.510]
Oh, it's an American tragedy and this is you know

[01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:15.270]
I'm feeling so

[01:52:16.690 --> 01:52:18.710]
nauseated is what I'm feeling grossed out

[01:52:20.230 --> 01:52:20.670]
I'm a

[01:52:20.670 --> 01:52:24.710]
Paul takes a lot to appall me. I've seen it all but I'm appalled this one

[01:52:24.710 --> 01:52:31.170]
I thought I knew how sick the media was they shocked the living crap out of me and show me that I'm not even close yet to understanding

[01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:37.930]
Fort Lauderdale hello, Neil yes, sir. I looked it up in a dictionary. If you have a shed in your backyard

[01:52:37.930 --> 01:52:41.150]
It qualifies as a compound. Uh-huh

[01:52:41.150 --> 01:52:46.890]
Uh, and what about the guy I can't see the guy in the phone man. What's that? Go ahead the guy from he hot

[01:52:47.310 --> 01:52:52.390]
Which is Buck Henry want the new stadium for a bed sport? Is that incredible? I like that buck Henry

[01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:56.350]
I love that if you saw that picture in the Sunsendle they were it looks like he's sucking on a person

[01:52:56.350 --> 01:53:00.930]
Buck Henry would be great under that name. Yeah, I think the only thing I have passed is the soccer team here

[01:53:00.930 --> 01:53:04.790]
Wanted a new stadium. I think that would that would roll that would go over big especially if we can bring in that women's soccer

[01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:08.930]
I mean we've ever got the WNBAs going to come in that's going to fail in about three months. So why not?

[01:53:09.710 --> 01:53:14.510]
Amazing all right, Neil. Keep up the good work. Thank you sir. I mean even when the men's soccer goes over here like a

[01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:16.670]
Fagged in pole vault or in a hot day in the middle of hell

[01:53:17.650 --> 01:53:19.370]
They're gonna have women's soccer here

[01:53:21.590 --> 01:53:29.390]
Just keep more stadiums and more arena's more tax money more fandom teams more mediocre rather than just keep subsidizing

[01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:32.610]
You know just keep doing it huh? No no no thanks

[01:53:32.610 --> 01:53:40.050]
And then I forget where I was reading which column it was but about how important major league baseball is to a real community

[01:53:40.050 --> 01:53:45.670]
As if somehow before we had the marlins, which is what like eight or nine years ago or seven eight years whatever was

[01:53:46.290 --> 01:53:50.390]
Somehow we didn't said we just couldn't survive without that. How why is that so important?

[01:53:53.710 --> 01:53:56.710]
I think we could we could probably squeak through somehow

[01:53:57.250 --> 01:54:03.090]
Not major league baseball here. I just don't know how much better it is. Let's remember. Yeah, you're right. You're right. You're right. You're just a suck

[01:54:04.350 --> 01:54:09.930]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. I'm calm by the Kennedy. Yeah

[01:54:10.050 --> 01:54:12.650]

[01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:29.230]
One of the outtakes I guess

[01:54:29.770 --> 01:54:32.830]
5 6 7 0 5 50 don't forget the Tom Green show tonight

[01:54:33.490 --> 01:54:38.890]

[01:54:47.710 --> 01:54:50.310]
Isn't that that's one of my favorite parts just the music

[01:54:52.110 --> 01:54:56.370]
It's said the music is just perfect for that show. It's just wacky and wiki and ridiculous enough

[01:54:56.370 --> 01:54:59.010]
It just it does things deep inside my rectum

[01:54:59.830 --> 01:55:01.990]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:08.150]
Hello, yes, sir. Neil. Yes, I am. I'm reading about American tragedy. I pick up the paper this morning

[01:55:08.150 --> 01:55:12.070]
A five-year-old shoots a four-year-old brother and

[01:55:13.050 --> 01:55:15.510]
Somebody had asked have a gun laying around his house. Mm-hmm

[01:55:16.650 --> 01:55:20.510]
And but just remember guns don't kill people cigars do yeah exactly

[01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:23.330]
But I mean I think we spend a little bit more time

[01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:29.010]
worrying about that and people that have you know control over their own lives like Kennedy did when he went up in that plane

[01:55:29.010 --> 01:55:33.630]
Right, I think things would be a lot better off. Okay. Thanks. Hold your breath. Yeah, and have a great day

[01:55:34.150 --> 01:55:38.810]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the thank you

[01:57:50.770 --> 01:57:55.850]
Okay, thanks Julio one of your people 5 6 7 or 5 doesn't like the word means is 60 pound 5 6

[01:57:55.850 --> 01:58:01.070]
Look hypocrite when don't have it how many how years have we been doing this when somebody wants to

[01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:05.570]
You know take a cheap shot because they're mostly illiterate anyway like him now you're a hypocrite

[01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:07.250]
They don't you're right. They don't even know what it means

[01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:13.510]
But it sounds good. It's a good. It's a good shot. You know. Oh, you're a hypocrite. You know what that means. Well, how do you spell it?

[01:58:14.970 --> 01:58:16.550]
H.Y.C

[01:58:18.010 --> 01:58:24.450]
5 6 7 H.I.P.P.O.T.O 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one lie

[01:58:24.450 --> 01:58:27.670]
Thanks for listening to 5 60 WQ Ed by the way Julio

[01:58:28.850 --> 01:58:30.810]
Here's a mobile in Miami hello

[01:58:30.810 --> 01:58:31.890]
Hey, Nio. How are you doing?

[01:58:32.290 --> 01:58:36.890]
He's just a little sour because his application for men so was caught up in the mail

[01:58:36.890 --> 01:58:39.090]
Not really Martin ran off of his boyfriend

[01:58:39.090 --> 01:58:42.570]
Exactly listen on the serious side

[01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:46.090]
When when the panthers were getting new in new arena

[01:58:46.090 --> 01:58:51.390]
I still remember you kind of being a little giddy about it and talking about how you got the busman's tour and

[01:58:52.010 --> 01:58:57.250]
You know that the panther arena seemed to be all right most notably probably because you're a big panther fan

[01:58:57.250 --> 01:59:04.930]
No, more notably most notably because the taxpayers aren't paying for it's a bed tax the the tourists are paying for not the people live in Broward County

[01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:08.930]
Well, if you've been listening to the to the rhetoric that's been flowing around lately on the station

[01:59:08.930 --> 01:59:16.130]
It seems to none of these days stadiums were built purely with uh, you know public money as it were without private money as it was

[01:59:16.130 --> 01:59:18.110]
But you're only looking at half of the picture

[01:59:18.110 --> 01:59:22.470]
You also miss me saying as recently as yesterday that if Wayne with all the threats to the public

[01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:24.810]
I mean you're talking about once they already had it bill

[01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:27.750]
What am I going to do say no? I'm not going to go look at it

[01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:31.290]
And I'm not going to take my free tickets from the radio station. I'm not going to do that

[01:59:31.290 --> 01:59:32.450]
You're right. You're right on that

[01:59:32.450 --> 01:59:34.850]
But I said it's usually yesterday if they would have moved them out of town

[01:59:35.290 --> 01:59:37.730]
Life would have gone on I can live without the panthers

[01:59:37.730 --> 01:59:41.170]
Okay, I could see that I could see that find me a habit solution for that whole Kennedy

[01:59:41.170 --> 01:59:46.990]
I mean let me ask you this question is the community is somehow enhanced because we have majorly sports teams here

[01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:47.630]
No

[01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:53.210]
I like my marlins. I mean I'm just saying you know, I'm well, guess what almost nobody else does

[01:59:53.210 --> 01:59:56.590]
Okay, I got to accept that though Neil as a grown man I can accept that

[01:59:56.590 --> 02:00:01.890]
Well, let me say this to you if the panthers were drawing as few people as the marlins are drawing proportionally

[02:00:01.890 --> 02:00:06.230]
If they were drawn like maybe three thousand people are gaming instead of 17 or 18 thousand the panther game

[02:00:06.230 --> 02:00:09.410]
And Wayne said well guess what we got to fold up and move someplace else

[02:00:09.930 --> 02:00:14.050]
Okay, fine. I understand that why can't you understand that instead of saying oh

[02:00:14.050 --> 02:00:16.670]
We're gonna have to build enough of three hundred million dollars stadium

[02:00:16.670 --> 02:00:21.790]
So you can make the money etc. And so on with taxpayer money if John Henry if John Henry was got a

[02:00:22.350 --> 02:00:25.490]
165 foot yacht in Juneau, Alaska's got that kind of money

[02:00:25.490 --> 02:00:28.530]
Let him be a man of his word which would be the first time in his town

[02:00:28.530 --> 02:00:33.150]
It's ever happened other than Joe Robbie and let him put the money up and build his own god damn stadium

[02:00:33.150 --> 02:00:38.310]
And you know what father he was vilified a lot of times Joe Robbie was certainly you know the man

[02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:41.330]
Well, he wasn't the nicest guy that ever walked the earth

[02:00:41.330 --> 02:00:44.870]
But the fact is that if it weren't for Joe Robbie there wouldn't be any dolphin to either

[02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:49.370]
Which means there wouldn't have been any pro player stadium and there wouldn't have been any marlins and there would have been any of this crap

[02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:52.590]
Exactly, which is why originally you know you still got a you know

[02:00:53.170 --> 02:00:55.530]
I know the Joe Robbie stadium. I don't like the name change

[02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:57.570]
Listen Neil if you have a big dish

[02:00:57.570 --> 02:01:04.990]
You can you can manage to catch Star Trek 24 7 a day and miss every single ounce of Kennedy coverage. I'll pass have a great day pal

[02:01:04.990 --> 02:01:07.090]
Take a how to suds

[02:01:07.090 --> 02:01:10.930]
5 670 560 pound 560 on the mobile one line

[02:01:11.930 --> 02:01:13.830]
Here's Miami hello

[02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:20.530]
Oh, uh, change my mind. Okay, great changes mine. Okay. I guess we did too change my mind

[02:01:20.530 --> 02:01:22.290]
That's in the one that's the first sir

[02:01:22.290 --> 02:01:25.210]
The first time I've been doing this for 120 70 years

[02:01:25.210 --> 02:01:31.090]
That's the first time in all the years I've been doing this. I ever punched up a line and somebody said up change my mind

[02:01:31.890 --> 02:01:35.590]
Which is another way of saying chickened out or had no material or see you

[02:01:36.210 --> 02:01:37.370]
And have a great life sir

[02:01:38.230 --> 02:01:41.110]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hi. Good morning. Yes, sir

[02:01:41.110 --> 02:01:46.630]
Um, I was talking to a crowd of people yesterday and I was explaining to them that did you have a megaphone when you were doing this?

[02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:53.270]
Yeah, sure that and I was explaining to them that I think Kennedy was as negligent as if he got behind the wheel of a car

[02:01:53.950 --> 02:01:58.950]
After drinking several botquatonic. You know, that's not correct. Well, sir. He didn't have to go

[02:01:58.950 --> 02:02:03.670]
He didn't have to take a break during a drunk driver with somebody who took a risk

[02:02:03.670 --> 02:02:08.810]
I think is is ludicrous is really getting carried away wait a minute when I get behind of a wheel

[02:02:09.290 --> 02:02:12.810]
Behind a wheel of a car and I've been drinking that's a risk and if I got past it

[02:02:12.810 --> 02:02:16.530]
No, no, it's not it's not a risk. It's against the law. Okay. He didn't break any laws

[02:02:17.090 --> 02:02:22.570]
Didn't break laws nail he broke every f a law that they cut poverty be by going into the IMC conditions

[02:02:22.570 --> 02:02:24.070]
So he did break laws

[02:02:24.990 --> 02:02:28.010]
You agree there. I don't know. Well, are you on the plane?

[02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:34.730]
Was I on the aircraft? No, but he broke laws by going IMC. You don't go in IMC

[02:02:36.010 --> 02:02:42.550]
We don't means what I don't even know what that might right IFR you don't go in IFR conditions. Yeah, your VFR policy conditions

[02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:45.130]
Conditions, huh? Okay. That's the key word

[02:02:45.130 --> 02:02:49.510]
And I see here's a mistake was getting talked into what they were supposed to leave at 5.30

[02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:51.910]
This was supposed to be a daylight flight

[02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:56.010]
This was supposed to happen during daylight hours when visibility was better

[02:02:56.010 --> 02:02:57.310]
He had no business long enough

[02:02:57.310 --> 02:03:01.550]
He got talked into it by his wife who was in system and the fact that the system law showed up three hours late

[02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:04.570]
That's why they left at 8.30 instead of 5.30. That's why they're all dead

[02:03:04.570 --> 02:03:07.330]
So his negligent he should not have gone negligent

[02:03:07.330 --> 02:03:12.230]
But not like a drunk driving what differences to make what's the point? Does it make does it make you feel better to

[02:03:12.230 --> 02:03:15.070]
It doesn't it doesn't so much of the point

[02:03:15.070 --> 02:03:20.190]
Would it well? I'm just trying to to make a statement that if if he didn't go they'd be alive today

[02:03:20.190 --> 02:03:23.830]
And if she wouldn't have forced him to go and if he would have been strong enough to say no

[02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:27.530]
I'm not gonna do it because it's too much of a risk. They would be alive today. That's correct. Thank you

[02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:34.390]

[02:04:00.810 --> 02:04:03.690]
And there's not that much courage for him. I cannot believe it

[02:04:03.690 --> 02:04:07.690]
Cubans die every day on the sea. Yes. What the hell is that guy to do with this?

[02:04:07.870 --> 02:04:08.250]

Here's West Palm Beach. Hello

[02:05:05.570 --> 02:05:14.210]
Yes, sir. Hey, Neil. Yeah, I haven't heard anybody talk about it. Do you about the innate that all his ribs broken and his balls knocked open pretty bad and his balls knocked open

[02:05:14.210 --> 02:05:17.610]
Yeah, they said his testicles were very very swollen, which means they kicked them in pretty good

[02:05:17.610 --> 02:05:21.090]
They broke all his ribs and they claimed it was suicide. Yeah, I did read that yeah

[02:05:21.090 --> 02:05:27.030]
I was a dirt bag, but still I don't think you should be killed and beaten it up by cops in this prison. Mm-hmm

[02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:31.510]
That's all okay. Thanks. Okay. That was pretty profound

[02:05:32.970 --> 02:05:35.930]
5.670560 pound 560 on the mobile one line

[02:05:36.490 --> 02:05:40.450]
Here's the mobile in Hollywood. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hi, Neil

[02:05:41.170 --> 02:05:45.710]
I'm cracking up try to try to control yourself. I know it's not easy with this parade of brilliant calls

[02:05:45.710 --> 02:05:47.790]
But try to control yourself. I'm doing the best I can

[02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:50.730]
I'm sucking on my cigar so hard it's coming out my earlobe

[02:05:52.030 --> 02:05:54.070]
First of all, I just like to say that you

[02:05:54.070 --> 02:05:56.950]
Hank and Mandage are what keep me listening

[02:05:57.410 --> 02:06:04.110]
station right and the other thing is that the guy with the owls if guilty he had some better people to work with in the morning that morning

[02:06:04.110 --> 02:06:07.310]
Sure might improve too, but go ahead. No, I love my love his voice. Yeah

[02:06:08.830 --> 02:06:14.430]
But the guy with the owls on Marco Island. Mm-hmm. I would rather see like two owls

[02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:18.390]
I would rather see two owls and you know five

[02:06:19.850 --> 02:06:24.770]
luxury mansions. Yeah, that's only an opinion. Okay, and the handshake

[02:06:27.210 --> 02:06:31.890]
Yeah, I have a friend who's very young. I'm a lot older than he is

[02:06:32.690 --> 02:06:38.790]
And he gave me one of his handshakes the other day and it cracked me up because took me back to 1969

[02:06:39.410 --> 02:06:40.530]
The same handshake

[02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:46.590]
So what goes your hand? Oh, you're from the drug brothers grip now. Is that it? That made it come back? Oh, yeah. Oh great

[02:06:46.590 --> 02:06:51.710]
Thank you. All right. Thanks. All right. Maybe in fact maybe someday if we live long enough, you'll be in again

[02:06:51.710 --> 02:06:54.270]
Like those old white bucks, you know

[02:06:54.830 --> 02:06:55.270]
Yeah

[02:06:55.930 --> 02:07:00.090]
Those old bell bottom pants don't throw much is hang on home because someday they'll be in again

[02:07:02.590 --> 02:07:06.530]
Fine and of course like those you know those big one of the color sibrans

[02:07:06.530 --> 02:07:10.970]
That flared out those hog mutton chops mutton chops

[02:07:11.650 --> 02:07:17.250]
You know haven't cut off but save the here because you can always paste it back on again when it comes back in the style kind like kind of like

[02:07:17.250 --> 02:07:22.150]
Josh Moro and young and horny Nick you're not old fashioned. You're just way ahead of your time

[02:07:22.150 --> 02:07:27.510]
That's all no way way behind the time. I got to catch up. Isn't that how it works? I don't know. I'm confused

[02:07:28.730 --> 02:07:31.890]
Yeah, I'm hip and I'm cool man. So that's not what's up

See, let me say it again when you find illiterate people especially those of darker complexion than you are

[02:07:41.050 --> 02:07:46.410]
Why do you want to emulate their behavior? That's what I find very very puzzling all of my life

[02:07:46.410 --> 02:07:47.610]

[02:14:34.230 --> 02:14:34.630]
Hi

[02:14:35.230 --> 02:14:42.290]
Two things I wanted a mention today. I couldn't believe it this morning when I saw a US naval ship

[02:14:42.290 --> 02:14:47.410]
Was being used to bury can of the you know was this first kind of these issues. Yeah number two moving on. Yes

The cost of that moving along. Yes. Okay, and the other one is the recovery as a recovering drug addict would like 12 years

[02:14:57.510 --> 02:15:02.130]
Clean. You know, I've heard you discuss the God cause that many times

[02:15:03.050 --> 02:15:07.630]
And you know my higher power is not God. Yeah, it's good orderly direction

[02:15:07.630 --> 02:15:13.770]
You know, uh, whatever works for you man if it works for you more power to you higher lower in between

[02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:19.710]
You know, it obviously does it does not necessarily religiously at all. Yeah

[02:15:20.230 --> 02:15:23.530]
You know, it's just another crux like religion, but it's just a different one

[02:15:23.530 --> 02:15:25.230]
If it works for you, uh, it stays over

[02:15:25.710 --> 02:15:27.450]
Here's a mobile in Miami Beach hello

[02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:31.270]
Neil yes, sir. How you doing? Oh, I changed my mind

[02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:32.350]
No, just kidding

[02:15:33.050 --> 02:15:37.150]
Listen, uh, you're gonna have to have you know how fast my finger is man

[02:15:37.150 --> 02:15:42.670]
I've got to listen by you. This is good. I just came from the bank. Okay. It correct me if I'm wrong

[02:15:42.670 --> 02:15:47.030]
But for the last few weeks over the radio and the TV they've been saying turn in your pennies

[02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:49.270]
Well, your pennies are saying to the bank and turn them in

[02:15:49.890 --> 02:15:52.310]
Correct, I never heard that. Where have they been saying that?

[02:15:52.350 --> 02:15:55.150]
It's been going on if they want you to turn any pennies is

[02:15:55.150 --> 02:16:00.470]
See something on CNN about that. There's a shortage of them and people will be in all these crap loads of pennies

[02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:06.870]
Yeah, it just doesn't top it off. I rolled 50 hours with the pennies just just to do my part turn in the pennies

[02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:10.090]
$60 to the bank and you know they told me

[02:16:10.650 --> 02:16:17.270]
They charge they're gonna charge me 20 cents per roll to process them. Yeah, and they're already rolled and everything

[02:16:17.910 --> 02:16:21.210]
20 cents per roll that that's a little bit ridiculous, isn't it?

[02:16:21.630 --> 02:16:22.970]
So 20 cents per what?

[02:16:23.490 --> 02:16:26.930]
For the role for the banks to take the pennies they suggest that in the take them

[02:16:26.930 --> 02:16:33.890]
They're gonna charge me 20 cents per roll. I argue with the guy's 50 minutes to find out why and he couldn't give me a good reason why

[02:16:33.890 --> 02:16:35.470]
Just that's what it was. I would tell him

[02:16:36.370 --> 02:16:41.890]
That's what I would tell him. I really wanted to tell you what but uh search tries to take your money. That's nice

[02:16:41.890 --> 02:16:46.290]
Yeah, yeah, you get 30 cents on the roll. I hope you didn't I hope he didn't do that

[02:16:46.290 --> 02:16:50.290]
No, I walked out here. I said something. I told you guys go to hell. Let's take that good job. Okay

[02:16:50.710 --> 02:16:52.650]
We'll take him over here even Steven. Okay

[02:16:53.490 --> 02:16:55.530]

Just bring him in jars being him in barrels with no care bring all the pennies you got

[02:17:07.430 --> 02:17:09.870]
Because we got to pay John Henry we got to pay Wayne

[02:17:09.870 --> 02:17:13.850]
We got to pay through the nose man just to keep all this and now we got to pay the Huracun's too

[02:17:13.850 --> 02:17:14.870]
Don't forget about that

[02:17:15.450 --> 02:17:20.570]
So we can put all this horseball crap on the video and pretend the Greg Reed is a broadcaster. That's what we got to do

[02:17:21.790 --> 02:17:27.150]
So bring your pennies and bring your dimes and your dollars and your wooden nickels a lot of people don't want wooden nickels

Okay, let's go to a mobile in Miami.

[02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.730]
Hello.

[02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:30.250]
Hello?

[02:20:30.490 --> 02:20:30.810]
Yes, sir.

[02:20:31.250 --> 02:20:33.430]
I'm calling for Miami about this penny sale tax.

[02:20:33.630 --> 02:20:33.970]
Yes, sir.

[02:20:34.290 --> 02:20:36.450]
I'm a little bit confused about it.

[02:20:36.450 --> 02:20:36.870]
It's a little bit complicated.

[02:20:36.870 --> 02:20:37.930]
I'll make it very simple for you.

[02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:38.950]
Just keep one word in mind.

[02:20:39.050 --> 02:20:39.130]
No.

[02:20:39.270 --> 02:20:41.150]
And that word will keep going through your head over and over again.

[02:20:41.150 --> 02:20:41.270]
No.

[02:20:41.390 --> 02:20:41.610]
Yeah.

[02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.970]

[02:20:43.110 --> 02:20:43.270]
No.

[02:20:44.410 --> 02:20:46.670]
Because as far as I'm concerned, I'm thinking about it.

[02:20:47.570 --> 02:20:52.690]
As far as toll taxes go, when we use the pills, it is tax deductible, but taxes aren't told deductible.

[02:20:52.810 --> 02:20:54.710]
So why isn't anybody bringing that up as a point?

[02:20:54.770 --> 02:20:54.910]
Right.

[02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:57.150]
That's all I have to say.

[02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:59.050]
Thanks for giving me the time to talk to you.

[02:20:59.050 --> 02:20:59.490]
Just say.

[02:20:59.650 --> 02:20:59.770]
No.

[02:21:00.210 --> 02:21:00.370]
Please.

[02:21:00.850 --> 02:21:01.010]
No.

[02:21:01.430 --> 02:21:02.670]
Over and over again.

[02:21:02.790 --> 02:21:02.930]
No.

[02:21:03.090 --> 02:21:03.750]
Just keep thinking that.

[02:21:03.750 --> 02:21:03.970]
No.

[02:21:04.130 --> 02:21:09.810]
I don't want to be negative, but five six seven, oh five sixty, pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:11.750]
Here's Carl Springs.

[02:21:11.770 --> 02:21:12.150]
Hello.

[02:21:12.390 --> 02:21:12.970]
I'm Neil.

[02:21:13.130 --> 02:21:13.450]
Yes, sir.

[02:21:13.690 --> 02:21:15.870]
Yes, look at the bright side of the JFK situation.

[02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:20.530]
Can you picture what would be going on right now if he's being buried next week?

[02:21:21.090 --> 02:21:21.330]
Oh.

[02:21:21.730 --> 02:21:22.610]
I'm telling you something.

[02:21:22.630 --> 02:21:22.950]
Oh.

[02:21:23.370 --> 02:21:24.070]
That's the thing.

[02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:25.450]
I want to tell you, you know, during the...

[02:21:25.450 --> 02:21:26.810]
You have to choose, bury him the next day.

[02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.250]
The glory?

[02:21:27.410 --> 02:21:27.490]
The glory?

[02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:33.670]
During this last commercial break, I flipped over for the first time since I sat down here this morning.

[02:21:33.670 --> 02:21:35.910]
To CNN, because I can't stand.

[02:21:36.090 --> 02:21:36.490]
Oh, yeah.

[02:21:36.570 --> 02:21:36.990]
Guess what?

[02:21:37.290 --> 02:21:38.010]
He's on the...

[02:21:38.010 --> 02:21:42.690]
He's on the film beach, which is on the flip side of the scene that we're seeing here.

[02:21:43.090 --> 02:21:44.450]
Off Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

[02:21:44.930 --> 02:21:47.690]
And there's the ship out there in the water, the same picture they've had on.

[02:21:47.850 --> 02:21:49.650]
I guess, inside, came into this morning.

[02:21:49.810 --> 02:21:50.870]
And they just won't give it up.

[02:21:50.970 --> 02:21:51.970]
They will not let go.

[02:21:52.350 --> 02:21:55.730]
You know, on top of that, I was thinking, where's Haraldo's been to all this?

[02:21:56.050 --> 02:21:58.330]
Okay, last night I'm home, surfing the TV.

[02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.730]
Yeah.

[02:21:58.730 --> 02:22:05.190]
And sure enough, there's Haraldo with a cup with one or two carers, one or two carers

[02:22:05.190 --> 02:22:08.190]
that's talking about how well the bodies they preserved under water.

[02:22:08.810 --> 02:22:10.510]
I mean, that's what they're talking about, you know, me...

[02:22:10.510 --> 02:22:11.610]
That's tasteful, yeah.

[02:22:11.950 --> 02:22:12.630]
You're very tasteful.

[02:22:12.690 --> 02:22:17.090]
But I'm just saying, you know, thank God it's trying to be like a weak swarth, right?

[02:22:17.430 --> 02:22:20.290]
But if he's getting buried next Thursday, we should be the third day of the party.

[02:22:20.290 --> 02:22:21.090]
I'd have to leave the country.

[02:22:21.090 --> 02:22:22.290]
I'd have to go on vacation again.

[02:22:22.530 --> 02:22:23.090]
I'm top, top.

[02:22:23.210 --> 02:22:25.610]
I'm going to take you to shoot some crap to do something, please.

[02:22:25.970 --> 02:22:26.390]
Okay, pal.

[02:22:26.670 --> 02:22:26.830]
All right.

[02:22:26.830 --> 02:22:27.530]
See ya.

[02:22:27.710 --> 02:22:30.210]
We can stay here and get all the crap we want right there on CNN.

[02:22:30.430 --> 02:22:30.650]
Kennedy.

[02:22:31.470 --> 02:22:31.870]
Confondent.

[02:22:32.190 --> 02:22:32.590]
Yeah.

[02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:34.690]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:40.010]
If there's any person listening to me right now who doesn't think that this whole media circuit

[02:22:40.010 --> 02:22:43.590]
that's going on is one of the sickest things in the history of the human race, then we're going

[02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:46.830]
to get you an instant group rental of bottoming.

[02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:54.670]
Here's Cooper City.

[02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.990]
Hello.

[02:22:55.570 --> 02:22:56.490]
You know, how you doing?

[02:22:56.890 --> 02:22:57.130]
Okay.

[02:22:57.790 --> 02:22:58.210]
All right.

[02:22:58.290 --> 02:22:59.810]
Another little spin on this.

[02:23:00.970 --> 02:23:06.170]
The one thing that kind of takes me off is the fact that if you just been a regular old guy,

[02:23:06.290 --> 02:23:08.430]
this wouldn't have gotten 30 seconds on the newscast.

[02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:09.230]
All right.

[02:23:09.610 --> 02:23:11.570]
But it had been me and my family come up today.

[02:23:11.650 --> 02:23:12.070]
Well, I know that.

[02:23:12.290 --> 02:23:12.290]

[02:23:12.610 --> 02:23:15.070]
You know, if I didn't show up, then we know that.

[02:23:15.070 --> 02:23:16.390]
Well, you know, give them three days.

[02:23:16.890 --> 02:23:17.330]
They'll show up.

[02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:18.230]
All right.

[02:23:19.230 --> 02:23:19.830]
Another thing.

[02:23:20.530 --> 02:23:29.050]
With the Panthers, the fact that the arena is not, you know, tax funded.

[02:23:31.550 --> 02:23:32.030]
Uh-huh.

[02:23:32.490 --> 02:23:32.690]
Okay.

[02:23:32.810 --> 02:23:34.030]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:23:34.250 --> 02:23:34.850]
POP 5, 60.

[02:23:35.010 --> 02:23:38.070]
There seem to be a lot of these people having like a change of heart like a mid sentence, you know.

[02:23:38.410 --> 02:23:40.570]
Basically because they have nothing to say they don't know what they're talking about.

[02:23:40.830 --> 02:23:41.810]
That certainly, isn't it?

[02:23:42.030 --> 02:23:42.210]
No.

[02:23:43.970 --> 02:23:44.590]
Here's my me.

[02:23:44.610 --> 02:23:44.810]
Sure.

[02:23:44.850 --> 02:23:45.190]
Hello.

[02:23:45.870 --> 02:23:46.450]
Hi, Neil.

[02:23:46.610 --> 02:23:46.930]
Yes, sir.

[02:23:47.710 --> 02:23:49.890]
I've lived in South Florida for four years.

[02:23:50.410 --> 02:23:53.330]
I've had enough that I can, is more than I can stand.

[02:23:53.570 --> 02:23:53.730]
Hmm.

[02:23:54.010 --> 02:23:54.790]
I'm moving to LA.

[02:23:55.410 --> 02:23:55.670]
Really?

[02:23:56.110 --> 02:23:59.050]
I'm wondering if you know if Phil Hendry is still on the air out there.

[02:23:59.350 --> 02:23:59.630]
Of course.

[02:24:00.090 --> 02:24:00.310]
What?

[02:24:00.530 --> 02:24:01.010]
Are you sure?

[02:24:01.310 --> 02:24:01.670]
KFI.

[02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:02.590]
KFI.

[02:24:02.850 --> 02:24:03.070]
Uh-huh.

[02:24:03.230 --> 02:24:03.990]
I'll look for him.

[02:24:04.010 --> 02:24:07.010]
I'm sure going to miss your show, but not much else from down here.

[02:24:07.170 --> 02:24:07.410]
Okay.

[02:24:07.570 --> 02:24:08.090]
Good luck, pal.

[02:24:08.270 --> 02:24:08.530]
Thanks.

[02:24:08.530 --> 02:24:10.690]
So I had all those, uh, orientals.

[02:24:11.010 --> 02:24:11.750]
I'm sorry, Asians.

[02:24:12.970 --> 02:24:14.470]
Learn to speak of yet in the me's.

[02:24:14.490 --> 02:24:15.710]
It'll come in real handy for you.

[02:24:16.010 --> 02:24:19.570]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:24:19.650 --> 02:24:21.410]
What a great place that used to be out there, by the way.

[02:24:21.430 --> 02:24:21.910]
Oh, man.

[02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:23.370]
That was, that was some kind of a place.

[02:24:23.550 --> 02:24:24.030]
Used to be.

[02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:25.650]
Of course, Singh could be said about here.

[02:24:27.090 --> 02:24:28.310]
Here's a mobile in Tompano.

[02:24:28.310 --> 02:24:28.610]
Hello.

[02:24:28.970 --> 02:24:29.470]
Hi, Neil.

[02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:30.670]
I just, a couple things.

[02:24:30.990 --> 02:24:35.710]
There's a few people who are most of the majority who are just overwhelmed and overextremed

[02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:37.070]
and just being ridiculous about it.

[02:24:37.130 --> 02:24:40.910]
But there's a few people like myself who are in the middle who don't make these, you know,

[02:24:41.690 --> 02:24:42.390]
wise jokes.

[02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:44.250]
But we love Bobby.

[02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:44.830]
We did.

[02:24:45.070 --> 02:24:48.530]
You know, he, we thought he was going to change the world or change our country at the time.

[02:24:49.010 --> 02:24:49.790]
We love JFK.

[02:24:49.930 --> 02:24:51.510]
We love what he wanted to do for civil rights.

[02:24:52.030 --> 02:24:54.310]
And we, we missed that legacy in part of it.

[02:24:54.330 --> 02:24:57.210]
And it doesn't mean that we're in it or idiots or schmucks or whatever.

[02:24:57.450 --> 02:24:59.450]
But there's a, there's a middle ground here.

[02:24:59.890 --> 02:25:01.710]
Sir, so there's not a middle ground.

[02:25:01.890 --> 02:25:02.810]
There's no middle ground.

[02:25:02.810 --> 02:25:06.250]
Either you have, put this in its proper perspective or you get off.

[02:25:06.470 --> 02:25:06.470]

[02:25:06.470 --> 02:25:08.850]
And no, you're not putting it, it had nothing to do with Bobby.

[02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:09.290]
I know.

[02:25:09.410 --> 02:25:09.410]

[02:25:09.530 --> 02:25:11.870]
It would have, the whole thing he held out or JFK.

[02:25:12.210 --> 02:25:13.810]
And I just, I don't know what Bobby, we're taught what?

[02:25:14.350 --> 02:25:16.890]
I mean, do, do you remember when Bobby was running?

[02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:18.190]
Did, did, did, did I have a feeling?

[02:25:18.330 --> 02:25:19.770]
Did, do you ever get that excitement?

[02:25:20.090 --> 02:25:24.910]
I, sir, I went on here yesterday and talked at Great Length about watching the PBS special

[02:25:24.910 --> 02:25:26.930]
two nights ago at 10 o'clock.

[02:25:26.930 --> 02:25:28.370]
I didn't see the first part Monday.

[02:25:28.670 --> 02:25:30.710]
I saw the last two hours, which was about the sun.

[02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:33.930]
I was a big Kennedy fan that has nothing to do with this.

[02:25:33.930 --> 02:25:34.790]
It's an accident.

[02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:37.350]
We've had all kinds of accidents in the Kennedy family.

[02:25:37.350 --> 02:25:39.190]
And people have died prematurely.

[02:25:39.410 --> 02:25:41.070]
And the media hasn't done it to a friend of you.

[02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:47.530]
I was, John Kennedy Jr. had nothing to do with what you're talking about in any way, shape or form.

[02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:48.190]
We don't know.

[02:25:48.510 --> 02:25:49.710]
He was an unimportant person.

[02:25:50.910 --> 02:25:53.830]
As of now, he was, but we don't know what, what have happened, Neil.

[02:25:54.130 --> 02:25:57.030]
Meaning, well, what, sir, you talk about being in the middle ground.

[02:25:57.090 --> 02:25:58.590]
You need serious help.

[02:25:58.750 --> 02:25:59.770]
I don't know what I want to have.

[02:25:59.770 --> 02:26:02.930]
I just, because his name was Kennedy, he was, he was a, nothing.

[02:26:03.090 --> 02:26:03.930]
He was a zero.

[02:26:04.270 --> 02:26:06.190]
It was an active stupidity what he did.

[02:26:06.310 --> 02:26:07.470]
I'm not talking about the air.

[02:26:07.570 --> 02:26:09.130]
I'm talking about what I was.

[02:26:09.610 --> 02:26:10.690]
Forget about flying around.

[02:26:10.810 --> 02:26:15.710]
And again, if a man makes a great judgment like that, he sure is how would have made a great senator or great president.

[02:26:15.970 --> 02:26:17.570]
Maybe he could have driven somebody off the bridge.

[02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:19.390]
What are you talking about?

[02:26:20.250 --> 02:26:21.750]
Neil, I was just part of it.

[02:26:21.790 --> 02:26:22.150]
I can't.

[02:26:22.170 --> 02:26:24.170]
Sir, you, you need to get therapy.

[02:26:24.290 --> 02:26:25.110]
Okay, please.

[02:26:25.310 --> 02:26:29.750]
I'm going to say goodbye, get you some help, get, get, get, what you need is to have a whole

[02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:33.830]
portion of, you know, maybe you can go to that place where they send rosemary, you know, with the shock treatments.

[02:26:36.070 --> 02:26:37.070]
Electro shock therapy.

[02:26:37.230 --> 02:26:40.990]
I'm not a big advocate of a sure it's a barbaric thing, but in your case, it might not hurt.

[02:26:42.190 --> 02:26:43.530]
You just don't want to let go.

[02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:44.270]
It's gone.

[02:26:44.530 --> 02:26:49.550]
We're not talking about something that happened five minutes ago or five years ago or even ten years ago.

[02:26:49.790 --> 02:26:52.190]
We're talking about stuff from the distant past.

[02:26:53.170 --> 02:26:54.430]
I was a young man.

[02:26:54.530 --> 02:26:56.230]
I remember it all like it happened yesterday.

[02:26:56.230 --> 02:27:03.650]
It brought tears to my eyes again when I watched the Tuesday night, but you know something I can't wallow in all that stuff the rest of my life.

[02:27:05.110 --> 02:27:14.410]
And John Kennedy, the idea like I said yesterday, they don't have some kind of a factory where they keep stamping out Kennedy Messiahs where a new savior pops up every five or ten years.

[02:27:14.690 --> 02:27:15.550]
It doesn't happen.

[02:27:17.390 --> 02:27:18.630]
Oh, what he could have been.

[02:27:18.890 --> 02:27:25.350]
Yeah, and we could have been another one of the idol rich who put out a magazine that would have gone out of business because it was losing money hand over a fist.

[02:27:25.350 --> 02:27:26.450]
That's what it would have been.

[02:27:28.970 --> 02:27:34.710]
And the idea that just because somebody is born into a family that they have some kind of a this man sounds just like Joe Kennedy.

[02:27:35.870 --> 02:27:42.410]
You know, we got a legacy here for two terms for John, two terms for Bobby, two terms for Teddy, two terms for John Jr.

[02:27:42.870 --> 02:27:47.690]
And let's just have royalty here like they do in England that were always laughing at him and rightfully so.

[02:27:49.210 --> 02:27:50.370]
We don't want that.

[02:27:50.810 --> 02:27:52.550]
That's what separates this country.

[02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:57.090]
We don't have a king and a queen. We got a lot of queens, but we don't have a queen that we worship down to.

[02:27:58.270 --> 02:28:00.670]
And fairy princesses and all this other bull crap.

[02:28:00.970 --> 02:28:03.030]
And that's what you want. That's what you're living in.

[02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:05.770]
You're stuck in a time warp and you don't want to get out.

[02:28:07.090 --> 02:28:11.370]
I'm not going to let my life get all wrapped up in his crap from 30 years ago, 36 years ago.

[02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:12.510]
Yeah, it was wonderful.

[02:28:13.530 --> 02:28:15.230]
To have some hope, but you know what?

[02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:22.170]
They wiped out the hopes. They have to be a realist. You have to live in a real world now instead of living in some kind of a fantasy land.

[02:28:24.650 --> 02:28:29.810]
God almighty. Somebody's going to break the news to this guy that Santa Claus doesn't really exist and he's really going to fall apart.

[02:28:30.310 --> 02:28:31.250]
What's he going to do then?

[02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:36.530]
Oh, I can't wait for that day. I can imagine what that call is going to be like.

[02:28:37.650 --> 02:28:38.950]
Yeah, that's what it's going to be.

[02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:43.470]
He's in the middle ground. See, I told you he wasn't in the middle ground. I knew right off the bat.

[02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:46.490]
The way he started bringing in about Bobby and Jeff.

[02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:48.470]
What is that got to do with this?

[02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:57.130]
How about one David Kennedy died of the drug overdose up there in a hotel in the Palm Beach County?

[02:28:57.450 --> 02:29:02.290]
Did we ever get one call from people talking about the Kennedy legacy when that happened?

[02:29:04.050 --> 02:29:04.450]
No.

[02:29:07.050 --> 02:29:08.070]
North Miami. Hello.

[02:29:10.250 --> 02:29:10.890]
Yes, sir.

[02:29:11.310 --> 02:29:16.270]
Hey, John, I think you were right at the beginning of your show. It's just not worth talking about.

[02:29:16.270 --> 02:29:17.930]
Oh, it's just wearing the out.

[02:29:18.450 --> 02:29:23.290]
Wearing it's killing me. I mean, there's nothing else these people want to talk about. I realize it's the middle of summer.

[02:29:23.450 --> 02:29:27.930]
It's 400 degrees. It's boring as hell. There's nothing going on here. But Jesus, this is just unbelievable.

[02:29:29.090 --> 02:29:30.350]
Bobby and John.

[02:29:30.350 --> 02:29:35.590]
And you know something like I said before, if you want to be objective about it and look at how they all got there in the first place

[02:29:35.590 --> 02:29:42.750]
and what a son of a bitch, the old man was and all the goddamn bootlegging money that made their fortune in the first place, let's be honest about it.

[02:29:42.770 --> 02:29:44.690]
It was like a mafia family.

[02:29:44.930 --> 02:29:48.870]
That's what they were. I wanted many Godfather movies, I think.

[02:29:49.250 --> 02:29:51.930]
I wanted to bring up the cigar legislation.

[02:29:52.130 --> 02:29:56.070]
Please, please. I'm ready to bring up my lunch and I haven't even had one yet.

[02:29:56.070 --> 02:30:02.090]
Have you heard of a brand called Mars Tetans or Tetans? I don't know if they pronounce it.

[02:30:02.270 --> 02:30:03.650]
No, don't say teats on the air circle.

[02:30:04.010 --> 02:30:05.910]
I know, I know. I'm trying to be careful about this.

[02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:12.870]
No, this guy puts on every box and every package of cigars that he sells, the word toxic, and then he's got this calling crossbones.

[02:30:13.390 --> 02:30:16.370]
And then it says smoke this and you will die or smoke this and die.

[02:30:16.610 --> 02:30:16.710]
Right.

[02:30:17.150 --> 02:30:25.770]
And he sells like crazy because the people that buy cigars that are old enough to buy cigars, they know, hey, look, it's not good for you.

[02:30:25.770 --> 02:30:30.850]
But you know, hey, you do it in moderation and you act like a human being and like a normal person.

[02:30:30.870 --> 02:30:35.990]
One thing I promise you that if you smoke cigars, you'll die. If you don't smoke cigars, you'll still die.

[02:30:36.250 --> 02:30:41.270]
Can you imagine how much money the taxpayers will save if everybody puts that on their boxes?

[02:30:41.450 --> 02:30:47.070]
And they don't have to worry about this California law and the other law and the other law and the other law and sticking all that on their soul.

[02:30:47.850 --> 02:30:48.610]
Anyway, that's what I had.

[02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:50.830]
Nobody's taking my stokies away from me, man.

[02:30:51.590 --> 02:30:53.010]
I'm smoking right now.

[02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:53.470]
All right.

[02:30:53.470 --> 02:30:54.230]
I have stokies too.

[02:30:54.390 --> 02:30:54.630]
Okay.

[02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:55.490]
Thank you.

[02:30:56.810 --> 02:30:57.410]
Thank you.

[02:30:57.570 --> 02:30:57.570]

[02:30:57.590 --> 02:31:01.190]
If we finally had somebody who's got something important to talk about, that's a good cigar.

[02:31:01.390 --> 02:31:02.610]
This man's got his priorities right.

[02:31:02.670 --> 02:31:03.510]
Let's hear it for this guy.

[02:31:03.870 --> 02:31:06.490]
Finally, three hours and 25 minutes later.

[02:31:07.070 --> 02:31:08.250]
And where's all the women out there?

[02:31:08.470 --> 02:31:11.270]
They're probably over my aunt's house sweeping about poor John Jr.

[02:31:11.910 --> 02:31:14.690]
They're probably counting the number of particles that throw it in the sea there.

[02:31:14.890 --> 02:31:14.950]
Okay.

[02:31:15.230 --> 02:31:15.490]
Okay.

[02:31:15.530 --> 02:31:16.450]
Here's the ash number one.

[02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:19.310]
I'm surprised they're not, they don't have people diving after that.

[02:31:20.330 --> 02:31:22.530]
Of course, it's kind of hard once the ash is going to water.

[02:31:22.670 --> 02:31:23.110]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:31:23.290 --> 02:31:25.930]
Kind of hard to bring it back like the pieces of the Berlin wall.

[02:31:30.910 --> 02:31:37.310]
Taki, tasteless, disgusting, rotesque, voyeuristic, I mean just gruesome, morbid.

[02:31:38.110 --> 02:31:39.290]
This is morbid.

[02:31:40.550 --> 02:31:43.270]
And you people at CNN, man, I've got news for you.

[02:31:43.470 --> 02:31:44.270]
People are disgrace.

[02:31:44.330 --> 02:31:45.310]
You're like a laughing stock.

[02:31:45.910 --> 02:31:48.450]
It's like when you're sent a hyperventilating bitch to Cuba.

[02:31:48.450 --> 02:31:54.150]
When the pope was there, that Christiana Amman pulled with that phony accent she puts on.

[02:31:54.390 --> 02:31:57.750]
That was sitting there sucking the pope's robes with the disgusting.

[02:31:59.770 --> 02:32:01.470]
No wonder he looked so damn worn out.

[02:32:03.010 --> 02:32:06.010]
Between Fidel and her, it was a question of who is the doing the most of the sucking.

[02:32:06.170 --> 02:32:06.590]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:32:08.530 --> 02:32:08.810]
God.

[02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:10.490]
There's no fact in the church.

[02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:11.130]
Yeah.

[02:32:12.370 --> 02:32:13.090]
Thank God.

[02:32:14.010 --> 02:32:18.070]
Speaking of that, by the way, there's a new showing time that opened this weekend at the drama center called

[02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:18.950]
Naked Boy Singing.

[02:32:19.250 --> 02:32:19.870]
It's a must see.

[02:32:19.990 --> 02:32:21.770]
George is going to go see it.

[02:32:21.890 --> 02:32:25.070]
Or you know, a huge success in LA for more than a year and a half.

[02:32:25.210 --> 02:32:29.310]
It opened simultaneously off Broadway in New York as well as in South Florida to rave reviews.

[02:32:29.730 --> 02:32:30.850]
So what the hell does George know?

[02:32:31.390 --> 02:32:35.930]
Naked Boy Singing is an outrageous new musical review revolving around naked guys.

[02:32:36.090 --> 02:32:36.770]
What do you say to that?

[02:32:36.910 --> 02:32:37.290]
Oh, right.

[02:32:37.450 --> 02:32:38.190]
I know he'd like it.

[02:32:38.910 --> 02:32:39.310]
Fastic.

[02:32:39.690 --> 02:32:40.090]
Munchasm.

[02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:41.350]
Enchrazyma.

[02:32:41.850 --> 02:32:42.190]
Smegma.

[02:32:42.850 --> 02:32:43.250]
Severia.

[02:32:43.870 --> 02:32:44.270]
Serraya.

[02:32:44.270 --> 02:32:48.670]
They can all be attributed to the harmful effect of smoking cigarettes.

[02:32:49.390 --> 02:32:50.110]
Hello.

[02:32:50.590 --> 02:32:51.830]
I'm William Talbot.

[02:32:52.390 --> 02:32:54.970]
Perhaps you'll remember me as Hamilton Burger.

[02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:57.930]
Raymond Burr's adversary on every nation.

[02:32:58.750 --> 02:33:00.450]
And now I'm dead.

[02:33:01.110 --> 02:33:02.210]
So take it from me.

[02:33:02.610 --> 02:33:05.710]
Get the habit and you won't wind up like I did.

[02:33:06.390 --> 02:33:08.910]
Don't smoke and you'll never die.

[02:33:10.830 --> 02:33:11.550]
Never.

[02:33:12.170 --> 02:33:15.950]
This message paid for by the Millicent Dance High Smoking Committee for immortality.

[02:33:18.090 --> 02:33:18.610]
Damn it.

[02:33:19.070 --> 02:33:20.530]
Hey, anybody got a life?

[02:33:20.870 --> 02:33:21.030]
No.

[02:33:21.550 --> 02:33:22.550]
132 at 560 WQM.

[02:33:23.210 --> 02:33:24.890]
Don't forget if you smoke a lot, you're going to die.

[02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:26.870]
If you don't smoke at all, you're still going to die.

[02:33:27.170 --> 02:33:28.790]
And what about that booze I was talking about yesterday?

[02:33:28.990 --> 02:33:30.430]
It's supposed to be good for diabetics.

[02:33:31.050 --> 02:33:32.030]
I forgot to call about that.

[02:33:33.390 --> 02:33:37.050]
Yeah, that's what we need somebody to bring us some good non-fruity wine.

[02:33:37.590 --> 02:33:37.650]
Huh?

[02:33:38.930 --> 02:33:40.570]
I don't know anything about wine.

[02:33:40.730 --> 02:33:42.050]
I'm not going to pretend it was something about it.

[02:33:42.190 --> 02:33:42.970]
I don't.

[02:33:43.550 --> 02:33:45.230]
Something that wouldn't send my blood sugar scar,

[02:33:45.370 --> 02:33:47.730]
rocking like a drink or glass a day, I haven't looked to be 400.

[02:33:47.850 --> 02:33:50.810]
That would be great until I light up this cigar when I go out.

[02:33:51.170 --> 02:33:52.890]
Oh, don't tell my mother I was smoking a cigar.

[02:33:53.230 --> 02:33:55.390]
That'll be the next thing while she's rummaging through my trash.

[02:33:55.710 --> 02:33:57.170]
That only will she find a Snickers wrapper.

[02:33:57.430 --> 02:33:59.490]
She'll also probably find a wrapper for one of these cigars,

[02:34:00.070 --> 02:34:01.350]
for one of these great nixigars.

[02:34:02.210 --> 02:34:03.890]
So better watch where I throw my wrappers.

[02:34:04.790 --> 02:34:05.690]
Here's Pemberer Pine.

[02:34:05.870 --> 02:34:06.090]
Tell her.

[02:34:06.450 --> 02:34:07.530]
Hey, how you doin' today, Neil?

[02:34:07.690 --> 02:34:08.730]
All right, man.

[02:34:09.270 --> 02:34:11.970]
I wanted to see if I can make you a cart for all those that are really lost today

[02:34:11.970 --> 02:34:13.630]
that they have spent on holds for what?

[02:34:13.630 --> 02:34:19.010]
four and a half minutes ten and a half minutes yeah and they go uh...

[02:34:19.010 --> 02:34:20.050]
forget it

[02:34:20.050 --> 02:34:21.230]
yeah not bad

[02:34:21.230 --> 02:34:23.470]

thank god for that

[02:34:34.190 --> 02:34:37.430]
the brilliance the uh... vociferous the uh... hysterical

[02:34:37.430 --> 02:34:40.390]
gym and it's will be here to rattle his spear and hockey with sports

[02:34:40.390 --> 02:34:41.810]
china between two and six

[02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:46.790]
i wish them all a lot of the world they'll tell you that this is uh... this

[02:34:46.790 --> 02:34:50.590]
time of the years just it's unacceptable it's just there ought to be a law

[02:34:50.590 --> 02:34:53.110]
passed to prohibit this time of the year in this town

[02:34:53.770 --> 02:34:54.170]
unacceptable

[02:34:54.990 --> 02:34:58.170]
getting worse each and every year worse and worse

[02:34:58.810 --> 02:35:00.870]
here's a mobile in north lotterdale hello

[02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:04.470]
hey nil did you see the story in the sunset no today

[02:35:05.190 --> 02:35:07.070]
about the uh... what the docs

[02:35:07.070 --> 02:35:07.670]
priest

[02:35:09.030 --> 02:35:09.550]
in russia

[02:35:10.590 --> 02:35:11.190]
no

[02:35:12.190 --> 02:35:13.110]
you would love it

[02:35:13.110 --> 02:35:15.290]
you know absolutely love it

[02:35:15.290 --> 02:35:19.790]
this guy apparently drunkenness is not a problem with the church because

[02:35:19.790 --> 02:35:22.670]
many people it's many of the priesthood a drug

[02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:27.270]
yeah but this guy is good to keep the some some of the economy going right

[02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:30.050]
but this guy was not only

[02:35:30.950 --> 02:35:33.530]
he was shaking down other priests for money

[02:35:34.310 --> 02:35:36.570]
in order to do various uh...

[02:35:36.570 --> 02:35:40.710]
administrative tours he was like the head of the quarter dot search the head

[02:35:40.710 --> 02:35:42.790]
guy and the head yeah exactly the head man

[02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:44.770]
and he was

[02:35:46.170 --> 02:35:48.690]
wildly overtly openly homosexual

[02:35:49.470 --> 02:35:53.130]
so they finally would become a tremendous embarrassment and uh...

[02:35:53.130 --> 02:35:54.750]
they got rid of my foot you like it because

[02:35:55.450 --> 02:35:57.970]
as you know uh... from your uh... button there

[02:35:57.970 --> 02:36:02.370]
there's a fact in the church exactly that exactly what i was going to say

[02:36:02.370 --> 02:36:03.690]
there are no facts of the church

[02:36:03.690 --> 02:36:06.490]
so let me uh... ring up by saying

[02:36:06.490 --> 02:36:07.810]
don't go help

you know see this is what happens

[02:43:02.510 --> 02:43:05.910]
when you allow yourself to get compartmentalized and labeled

[02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:08.170]
you must never ever

[02:43:08.170 --> 02:43:11.590]
ever allow yourself to be part of a group

[02:43:11.590 --> 02:43:14.810]
you must not be a baby boomer

[02:43:14.810 --> 02:43:16.430]
a generation exer

[02:43:16.430 --> 02:43:18.250]
a generation ex-lachser

[02:43:18.250 --> 02:43:20.530]
and all this other media created crap

[02:43:20.530 --> 02:43:22.030]
it's insanity

[02:43:22.030 --> 02:43:26.550]
just a notion that because you were born in a particular year

[02:43:26.550 --> 02:43:29.050]
and lived your life during a particular era

[02:43:29.050 --> 02:43:31.470]
means that you adopted certain attitudes

[02:43:31.470 --> 02:43:32.410]
and behavior

[02:43:32.410 --> 02:43:34.190]
it is ridiculous

[02:43:36.890 --> 02:43:38.470]
but this guy is one of those

[02:43:38.470 --> 02:43:40.490]
professional baby boomers

[02:43:40.490 --> 02:43:42.430]

[02:44:47.250 --> 02:44:47.950]
how you doing John

[02:44:48.490 --> 02:44:50.270]
finally here's a rational person

[02:44:50.270 --> 02:44:52.430]
John and Lake Worth that's two this hour

[02:44:52.430 --> 02:44:54.090]
yeah i didn't want to let you down

[02:44:54.090 --> 02:44:55.910]
i'm on vacation i figured i'd give you a shout

[02:44:55.910 --> 02:44:57.410]
you're on vacation and you're here

[02:44:57.970 --> 02:44:59.350]
three mile in my house

[02:44:59.350 --> 02:44:59.750]
okay

[02:45:00.930 --> 02:45:04.070]
before i forget tonight on biography

[02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:06.130]
they have uh... joe kennedy

[02:45:06.650 --> 02:45:08.490]
i know you said you're a fan at that show

[02:45:08.490 --> 02:45:10.770]
so they're doing the thing on him last night

[02:45:10.770 --> 02:45:12.470]
they had a two hour special and jad kay

[02:45:12.470 --> 02:45:14.890]
tonight's all about his father it was excellent

[02:45:14.890 --> 02:45:16.890]
i really don't need any more jfk

[02:45:16.890 --> 02:45:18.990]
i saw the one on public television to do that

[02:45:18.990 --> 02:45:20.510]
i mean i've read the books

[02:45:20.510 --> 02:45:23.030]
about both assassinations have read more books

[02:45:23.030 --> 02:45:24.710]
than probably all the audience put together about

[02:45:24.710 --> 02:45:27.210]
all their lives about the assassinations

[02:45:27.210 --> 02:45:28.470]
you know what let me

[02:45:28.470 --> 02:45:31.150]
this is i've been meaning to every time i call it

[02:45:31.150 --> 02:45:32.490]
i never mentioned this but

[02:45:33.350 --> 02:45:35.250]
what i think you know the media is all whipped up

[02:45:35.250 --> 02:45:36.950]
you know and you go on and on about that

[02:45:36.950 --> 02:45:39.110]
the thing is you know when you were

[02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:41.050]
let's say in your 20s

[02:45:41.050 --> 02:45:42.890]
it was what maybe three tv stations

[02:45:44.030 --> 02:45:46.690]
couple of major newspapers and that was it

[02:45:46.690 --> 02:45:48.910]
now we have so much media

[02:45:48.910 --> 02:45:50.710]
oh sure they got 24 hours in a envelope

[02:45:50.710 --> 02:45:52.190]
you've got all these all news outlets

[02:45:52.990 --> 02:45:54.150]
msnbc and vk

[02:45:54.150 --> 02:45:55.170]
news tnn

[02:45:55.170 --> 02:45:58.530]
not only does the american public

[02:45:58.530 --> 02:45:59.690]
which you've also mentioned

[02:45:59.690 --> 02:46:03.550]
just love the gore and they love things like the channel seven and everything

[02:46:03.550 --> 02:46:06.150]
but these people these media

[02:46:06.150 --> 02:46:10.310]
the newspapers and the tv and the radio

[02:46:10.310 --> 02:46:11.130]
and this and that

[02:46:11.130 --> 02:46:14.490]
they all have to find a different angle in which to report

[02:46:14.490 --> 02:46:16.830]
otherwise they're all saying the same thing

[02:46:16.830 --> 02:46:18.570]
yeah so not only

[02:46:18.570 --> 02:46:20.770]
they have to cater to the american people

[02:46:20.770 --> 02:46:22.890]
to like things like this

[02:46:22.890 --> 02:46:25.150]
and the oj trial and so on and so forth

[02:46:25.150 --> 02:46:26.890]
but everybody has to look for a different

[02:46:26.890 --> 02:46:28.070]
but you know something as

[02:46:28.070 --> 02:46:30.530]
as ponderous as it was in some ways

[02:46:30.530 --> 02:46:32.650]
and as much as a lot of the

[02:46:32.650 --> 02:46:34.770]
how's what especially just turned their lives

[02:46:34.770 --> 02:46:36.850]
over to it at least the oj thing

[02:46:36.850 --> 02:46:38.730]
was captivating in many ways

[02:46:38.730 --> 02:46:40.830]
it was like a it was like a soap opera

[02:46:40.830 --> 02:46:43.410]
you know what? but this thing is a human tragedy

[02:46:43.410 --> 02:46:44.110]
it's an accident

[02:46:44.110 --> 02:46:46.250]
we have people die in accidents every day

[02:46:46.250 --> 02:46:48.410]
and this is a morbid thing

[02:46:48.410 --> 02:46:49.990]
well of course granted

[02:46:49.990 --> 02:46:51.410]
but the thing is that you know

[02:46:51.410 --> 02:46:52.330]
you actually

[02:46:52.990 --> 02:46:54.510]
okay his sister Caroline

[02:46:54.510 --> 02:46:55.670]
she just wrote a book

[02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:57.650]
okay the reason you haven't seen her around

[02:46:57.650 --> 02:46:58.970]
and she hasn't made any public statement

[02:46:58.970 --> 02:47:00.810]
is because she's anti-media

[02:47:00.810 --> 02:47:02.270]
as a matter of fact she just wrote a book

[02:47:02.270 --> 02:47:03.570]
i don't remember the name of it

[02:47:03.570 --> 02:47:06.110]
but it's about the media and how they've made their life

[02:47:06.110 --> 02:47:08.370]
of living hell yeah and that's why she's a recluse

[02:47:08.370 --> 02:47:09.730]
that's why she doesn't want anything to do

[02:47:09.730 --> 02:47:11.110]
that she's completely sick of it

[02:47:11.110 --> 02:47:12.630]
now the media knows this already

[02:47:12.630 --> 02:47:13.870]
okay they know about the book

[02:47:13.870 --> 02:47:15.150]
they know how much she can

[02:47:15.150 --> 02:47:17.810]
and jfk jr could not stand the media

[02:47:17.810 --> 02:47:18.910]
and they were following her router

[02:47:18.910 --> 02:47:20.270]
she was at her bicycle yesterday

[02:47:20.270 --> 02:47:26.230]
they have absolutely no respect

[02:47:26.230 --> 02:47:26.650]
for people

[02:47:26.650 --> 02:47:27.910]
no of course not

[02:47:27.910 --> 02:47:30.450]
and you know what she's trying to ride her bike

[02:47:30.450 --> 02:47:31.850]
and people how could she ride her bike

[02:47:31.850 --> 02:47:34.370]
well you know what what she's supposed to not live her life

[02:47:34.370 --> 02:47:35.530]
now that her brother is dead

[02:47:35.530 --> 02:47:37.530]
i mean just back off don't photograph

[02:47:37.530 --> 02:47:38.830]
they can't do that

[02:47:38.830 --> 02:47:42.110]
and that's the thing is there's just too much god damn media

[02:47:42.110 --> 02:47:43.070]
in the country and everybody

[02:47:43.070 --> 02:47:44.990]
you know the classic example this is

[02:47:44.990 --> 02:47:47.290]
you remember when mark maguire the whole thing

[02:47:47.290 --> 02:47:48.550]
with the supposed steroids

[02:47:48.550 --> 02:47:50.370]
okay that reporter

[02:47:50.370 --> 02:47:52.670]
went into this guy's locker

[02:47:53.690 --> 02:47:54.570]
snooping around

[02:47:54.570 --> 02:47:56.530]
right because he was just like my mother

[02:47:56.530 --> 02:47:57.290]
went into my garbage

[02:47:57.290 --> 02:47:58.310]
his father stick his head

[02:47:58.310 --> 02:48:00.730]
everybody was reporting on the same thing

[02:48:00.730 --> 02:48:02.450]
he's in the hall run race with sosa

[02:48:02.450 --> 02:48:03.990]
well this one guy

[02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:05.870]
you know everybody saying the same thing

[02:48:05.870 --> 02:48:07.830]
but he wanted to try and find something different

[02:48:07.830 --> 02:48:09.650]
so he went into the guys locker

[02:48:09.650 --> 02:48:11.150]
and that's my point

[02:48:11.150 --> 02:48:13.570]
is the point is that everybody there's so much media

[02:48:13.570 --> 02:48:15.370]
everybody saying the same exact thing

[02:48:15.370 --> 02:48:18.910]
that everybody has to dig a little bit deeper to find something

[02:48:18.910 --> 02:48:19.010]
a little bit deeper to find something

[02:48:19.010 --> 02:48:20.010]
but it's not going to change

[02:48:20.010 --> 02:48:22.810]
it's only going to get worse because the competition is getting more and more fierce

[02:48:22.810 --> 02:48:25.010]
I mean they're still on his woods hole messages

[02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:27.070]
they've had that same shot on there

[02:48:27.070 --> 02:48:27.710]
now on CNN

[02:48:27.710 --> 02:48:29.630]
and cousin William Kennedy Smith

[02:48:29.630 --> 02:48:30.630]
the other thing

[02:48:30.630 --> 02:48:32.530]
the point is that most of these people

[02:48:32.530 --> 02:48:33.430]
I too

[02:48:33.430 --> 02:48:36.070]
about four years ago I went cold turkey

[02:48:36.070 --> 02:48:38.870]
and I said look I am not going to watch channel 7 news anymore

[02:48:38.870 --> 02:48:40.830]
and I have not probably about four years

[02:48:40.830 --> 02:48:42.970]
because it's hypnotic actually

[02:48:42.970 --> 02:48:43.730]
to watch that

[02:48:43.730 --> 02:48:44.770]
because you actually

[02:48:44.770 --> 02:48:47.690]
you actually look for more misery

[02:48:47.690 --> 02:48:48.550]
more and more misery

[02:48:48.550 --> 02:48:50.890]
and I finally I just snapped out of it

[02:48:50.890 --> 02:48:52.610]
and I said that that's not going to happen

[02:48:52.610 --> 02:48:53.270]
people wanted

[02:48:53.270 --> 02:48:55.130]
well that's just it is all you have

[02:48:55.130 --> 02:48:57.450]
all the people are called make fun of rick sanchez

[02:48:57.450 --> 02:48:58.890]
and are decrying what they're doing

[02:48:58.890 --> 02:48:59.990]
they're all watching

[02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:01.770]
and how could they know what he's doing if they're not watching

[02:49:01.770 --> 02:49:03.070]
and that's just it you know

[02:49:03.070 --> 02:49:04.250]
you they're not kidding anybody

[02:49:04.250 --> 02:49:05.370]
you know people love this

[02:49:05.370 --> 02:49:06.990]
you said it for years and years and years

[02:49:06.990 --> 02:49:08.810]
people actually get off on this stuff

[02:49:08.810 --> 02:49:09.310]
sure they do

[02:49:09.310 --> 02:49:10.770]
on other people's misery

[02:49:10.770 --> 02:49:11.830]
and you know what if people

[02:49:11.830 --> 02:49:14.030]
would actually just turn off the TV

[02:49:14.030 --> 02:49:15.290]
change the child

[02:49:15.290 --> 02:49:17.490]
or just not read about certain things

[02:49:17.490 --> 02:49:18.810]
eventually the press

[02:49:18.810 --> 02:49:19.750]
would actually

[02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:20.470]
in this case

[02:49:20.470 --> 02:49:22.090]
like I said John you're deluding yourself

[02:49:22.090 --> 02:49:23.750]
okay I mean your intentions are good

[02:49:23.750 --> 02:49:25.030]
but you're it ain't going to happen

[02:49:25.030 --> 02:49:26.310]
well on a closing of

[02:49:26.310 --> 02:49:26.930]
I have no life

[02:49:26.930 --> 02:49:27.770]
that's the problem

[02:49:27.770 --> 02:49:28.550]
is there any

[02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:29.130]
look

[02:49:29.630 --> 02:49:30.890]
Chris Moore is gone

[02:49:30.890 --> 02:49:32.070]
I mean anybody

[02:49:32.070 --> 02:49:33.390]
was better than him

[02:49:34.930 --> 02:49:36.190]
marginally you'll find out

[02:49:36.190 --> 02:49:37.230]
see you John

[02:49:37.230 --> 02:49:37.490]
bye
