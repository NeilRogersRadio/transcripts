[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.760]
Don't really like it, but I see because it's green.

[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.600]
And then I'll go down town to watch the big grey.

[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.060]
Everyone's happy but no one marching is gay.

[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.520]
And I'm gonna keep on drinking beer that's good.

[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.020]
I'll drink until the cut is good.

What I'll be doing is we are all Irish women think that today is here.

[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.980]
So we potatoes hate being this electric beer.

[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.740]
Yeah, I'm gonna be the hell.

[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.280]
That's all we're gonna be doing.

[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.200]
Hello, Joe. What do you know?

[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.900]
We need a hit, so here I go.

[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.700]
Right, one, two, three, two, one.

[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.680]
Yeah, you're gonna get the weedies.

[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.380]
I'm trying to help you here.

[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.260]
I'm trying to help you.

[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.940]
I'm trying to help you.

[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.200]
I'm trying to help you.

[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.820]
I'm trying to help you.

[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.060]
I'm trying to help you.

[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.100]
I'm trying to help you.

[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.080]
I'm trying to help you.

[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.240]
I'm trying to help you.

[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.740]
I'm trying to help you.

I'm trying to help you.

[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.100]
And now they're speaking with her's love of how they stop their joe.

[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.060]
One night in Cleveland, oh, oh, oh, good, but three, come at deal.

[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.240]
I'm dying over here.

[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.840]
He's dead.

[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.900]
One of the worst, one of the most prolonged, one of the most dragged out deaths.

[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.900]
Thank God we had a little bit of a high this, you know, we had a little bit of a rest there.

[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.080]
Huh?

[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.000]
Can you imagine if they'd kept that thing up?

[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.620]
Oh, my God.

[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.360]
If the death watch, there has seldom been a death watch in the history of the human god damn race.

[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.260]
As long as the Joe to measure the good news is though I had Stanley Kubrick in the office pool.

[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.720]
Oh, huh?

[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.040]
That's our poll question today, by the way.

[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.740]
Hey, they're dropping like flies, man.

[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.600]
There's something going on and maybe it said why two key things.

[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.260]
It's only March.

[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.700]
It's only the eighth of March.

[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.720]
But they're already dropping like flies all over the place.

[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.540]
They're dying or croaking up a storm.

[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.580]
I'm dying over here.

[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.860]
And Stanley Kubrick, that's our poll question.

[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.800]
Kenneth M. M. M. M. M.

[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.040]
Joe, who made the greater contribution to the world?

[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.800]
Stanley Kubrick, one of the great filmmakers of all time, in my opinion.

[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.940]
Or Joe to measure.

[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.380]
That's a tough question.

[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.960]
That's, you know, of course on this station asking that question.

[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.260]
It's like asking Kenneth M. M. M. M.

[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.440]
Joe, Edward Murrell or a guilty.

[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.540]
That's like asking that question on this station.

[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.940]
Here's our first call of the week from the sunrise.

[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.440]
Hello.

[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.640]
Oh, okay.

[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.160]
Let's go to our first call of the week.

[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.020]
Here's sunrise.

[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.520]
Hello.

[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.280]
See, he got a long time ago.

[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.980]
Drugs.

[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.780]
Drugs.

[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.340]
Drugs overdraw.

[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.140]
Oh, overdraw.

[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.860]
This guy's got, how do you like that?

[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.220]
This guy waited all weekends since Friday.

[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.400]
Guess what, pal?

[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.280]
Now, that goes over with, okay?

[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.540]
Frankie Lyman on the teenagers.

[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.480]
He's dead.

[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:04.820]
This must have been the jackass that facts that, you know, sir, I thought about that over the weekend very briefly in between four speedings of carbohydrates.

[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.640]
I thought about that over the weekend.

[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.400]
You are a disgrace.

[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.360]
I mean, it's one thing to have good taste.

[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.460]
It's something to have bad taste.

[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.680]
You have no taste.

[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.940]
The eighth greatest recording artist of all time is Frankie Lyman and the frickin teenagers.

[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.040]
Better than Arrow Smith, better than Elton John, better than anybody.

[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.460]
Oh, by the way, George Jones.

[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.200]
Bad car wreck.

[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.080]
He may be joining the Tammy Wynett pretty soon.

[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.100]
Like I said, they're dropping life flies.

[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.180]
Nice haircut, by the way, George.

[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.340]
Jones, not you.

[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.440]
Okay, let's see if we can outdo that.

[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:41.980]
That was good.

[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.280]
He's got it all cute up.

[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.760]
Goody, goody by Frankie Lyman and the teenagers.

[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.060]
Can you, can you believe that?

[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.360]
I guess we ought to, nothing should shock me at this point at this stage of my life.

[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.620]
By the way, Maddie Bell, I came up the elevator this morning with little Maddie Bell, who's our, what is he?

[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.860]
He's the general sales manager number two.

[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.580]
Division three, something like that.

[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.260]
And I looked at him there and the elevator.

[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.620]
I thought, you know, I was wrong about him.

[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.300]
He's not for free.

[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.480]
He's about three foot six.

[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160]
Then he came in here and engaged George.

[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.080]
I'm sitting in here with a door wide open.

[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.140]
I want you to envision this.

[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.480]
If you saw the Lamy show, you know how the thing is set up here, our broom closet.

[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.780]
George is sitting in this broom closet in there and his door is wide open.

[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:26.600]
And my door is wide open.

[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:26.600]

[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.960]
We're like, you know, a couple of feet away from each other.

[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.420]
And little Maddie Bell, who I found is about two foot seven in that elevator.

[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.680]
I almost stepped on a poor son of a bitch, the food Nazi.

[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.400]
And then the elevator coming up.

[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.120]
Did he say anything to me about this big controversy we got going?

[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:42.740]
No.

[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.040]
So it comes into this.

[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.220]
But these people are so spineless in his building.

[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.960]
They're all afraid of Neil.

[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.040]
They're all afraid of Neil.

[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.280]
God, a dottering old faggot like me and they're afraid of me.

[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.060]
What does that tell you about them?

[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.160]
I mean, he's a granite only two foot one.

[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.200]
Comes up to my ankle.

[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.880]
But wait till you hear what this big controversy is all about.

[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.440]
Oh, Christ.

[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.020]
Yeah, it's serious.

[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.640]
I want you to stop and think about this.

[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:16.400]
All the things that go on in this place, day in and day out, all the deficiencies, all the lies, all the bull crap.

[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.180]
They're big, multi-million dollar lawsuit with Wayne and the Marlons.

[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.600]
All the things that go on in this place.

[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.520]
And what are they worried about?

[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.940]
Yeah, that's what they're worried about.

[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.880]
Oh my god.

[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.720]
Wait till you hear this one.

[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.080]
I swear to God, you'll pee in your pants and maybe in somebody else's too.

[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.540]
If the law allows.

[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.640]
9 minutes after 10 at 560 WQM.

[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.020]
Happy Monday to you.

[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.560]
God, I feel like I'm on death's door.

[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.680]
I'll tell you why later.

[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.900]
This face is stands for nothing.

[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.620]
I'm too sexy for my full skin.

[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.720]
Too sexy for my full skin.

[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.420]
Too sexy for a circumcision.

[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.120]
I'm too sexy for my full skin.

[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.080]
Too sexy for my full skin.

[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.760]
Too sexy for a circumcision.

[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.660]
I'm too sexy for a smear.

[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.580]
Too sexy for my tip.

[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.520]
Too sexy for a kiss clip.

[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.720]
Yes, I am a marble can't you see my stuff through my handling?

[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.640]
Yes, through my handling.

[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.540]
My religion.

[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.540]
My religion is clear through my handling.

[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.520]
Yes, through my handling.

[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.200]
I'm too sexy for a trim.

[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.260]
Too sexy for a whiffling gym.

[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.320]
Too sexy for my full skin.

[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.200]
I don't understand your people.

[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.200]
You better off before you know how big it's going to get.

[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.680]
Your boys can't control off.

[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.920]
He's going to have no place to stick his gum when he's not joining.

[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.100]
1015, I won't mention that on the other George.

[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.460]
1015 at 560 WQM.

[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.580]
It's a good thing they can't hear this side of the thing on their own.

[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.920]
Oh, if I ever mentioned by the way that sales people are assholes,

[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.020]
we got a new sales guy who's a real asshole.

[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.900]
His name is Todd.

[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.680]
What's his last name?

[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.140]
Todd one?

[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.960]
Not Todd Winnick, that's another Todd.

[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:16.780]
Todd, Dreck.

[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:17.360]

[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:17.940]
Todd Dreck.

[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.380]
That's right, good name for him too by the way.

[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.620]
He is Dreck on legs.

[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.820]
Good friend with fat boy by the way.

[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.300]
Hiding recommended him.

[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.840]
Birds of a feather suck together.

[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.320]
Okay, Todd, you jackass.

[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.680]
Man, is this guy a loser.

[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.680]
But anyway, another great letter to the editor in the hero today.

[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.380]
Always check this out to make sure that I know you don't have time.

[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.260]
You got a busy life, especially on a Monday morning.

[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.680]
You thought the letter to the editor the other day was great.

[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.120]
Wait until you hear this.

[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:44.960]
Don't do that.

[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.680]
I'm telling you.

[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.600]
Just wait until the next break and I'll tell you why.

[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.900]
You'll be gasping for oxygen if you, I'm telling you.

[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.200]
Don't do it.

[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.220]
What?

[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.680]
It's not the most unhealthy thing.

[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.440]
I'm telling you.

[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.360]
Don't do it.

[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.480]
I'm begging you.

[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:05.560]
Anyway, the headline on this letter says leadership proven from Anthony James Marone or is that Marone?

[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.260]
Maybe he knows Jimmy Marone at Yonkers Raceway.

[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.980]
Anthony Marone in Dear Field Beach.

[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:10.860]
Wait until you hear this letter.

[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:16.100]
This again is a letter that the prestigious Miami hero, one of the great newspapers in America, by the way.

[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.060]
So they think over there one hero plans it.

[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.140]
This is the kind of crap.

[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.160]
Let me say it again.

[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.880]
The Canon digwood New York Daily Messenger would not print this letter.

[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.580]
It's so stupid.

[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:25.620]
It says.

[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:32.660]
Political moves notwithstanding former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey would be an excellent president.

[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.960]
His year spent in the National Basketball Association and the Senate attest to his honesty.

[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.980]
End of letter.

[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.180]
This.

[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.800]
This is a letter in the goddamn Miami Herald.

[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.660]
You thought that I was stupid?

[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:54.760]
Exactly.

[00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.060]
Because you're spending the National Basketball Association.

[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.480]
I think that anybody who spent years in the NBA is qualified to be president.

[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.020]
Don't you?

[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:04.860]
Yes.

[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.560]
There you go.

[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:07.960]
How about Shaqiel, huh?

[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:09.740]
President Shaqiel.

[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.800]
After all, his last name is O'Neal.

[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.860]
Can't be all bad as a Neal on this.

[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.320]
A lot of Neal and go on there in the oral office.

[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.940]
I mean, I think doing this on purpose.

[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.620]
In fact, maybe I've inspired them.

[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.980]
I bet you they're making these things up.

[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.480]
Like Tom Jicke makes a half of those things and is on the radio TV, pay the book on Sunday.

[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.500]
He makes most of them up.

[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.300]
I bet you they make these damn letters up.

[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.200]
Nobody could possibly write something that in any and expect to get it published in a newspaper.

[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.540]
Maybe maybe like in the plantation middle school newspaper, but I doubt it.

[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.400]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:46.680]
Hello.

[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.040]
Welcome in a short week for a letter to the editor.

[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.940]
God almighty.

[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.560]
I vote for Stanley Kubrick.

[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.720]
Yeah, I agree.

[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.360]
Because let's get these sports people pissed off.

[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.400]
Okay, because I know we're going to be here an all day long about Jolton Joe DiMaggio.

[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.680]
Oh, I'll tell you one thing Stanley Kubrick never banked Marilyn Monroe.

[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.200]
I know.

[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:04.760]
That's true.

[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:05.280]
Right.

[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.260]
People don't even remember Marilyn Monroe in history.

[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.460]
But the, well, maybe they will.

[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.640]
But they're the only family, whatever's left of them.

[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.180]
They remember the thing that I think is that the thing that stands with the Maggio today is

[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.400]
other than personality, is this record of 56th Street gains getting ahead.

[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:22.880]
Yeah.

[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.180]
And I think that's probably stand because of the way they substitute pitches until baseball finally disappears.

[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:28.880]
Yeah.

[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.720]
But Kubrick has let the legacy of really great films.

[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.220]
Yeah.

[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.220]
And great films are an art form.

[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.140]
It's like saying that the mental late day will be remembered longer than they got in Spain.

[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.120]
You know, it will just just won't work that way.

[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.080]
And I think that so I, my vote is the Cooper, even though I'm listening to QAN.

[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:45.620]
Okay.

[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.300]
I got to know.

[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:46.720]
Okay.

[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.200]
Thanks.

[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:47.420]

[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.280]
Yesterday I watched and CNN.

[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.620]
I was unaware that Stanley Kubrick had a bit the, a bit the big one.

[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.220]
And here's the thing comes on and they're showing of course right.

[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.560]
See, I guess what they do like with the Dimaio thing.

[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.700]
They've been ready for months now.

[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:07.320]
They had the thing by Gerek Ugly on CNN this morning, one of those profiles in the, you know,

[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.640]
because they've got already for months.

[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.040]
Come on, die already so we can put this on here is basically what they're saying.

[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.240]
So anyway, Stanley Kubrick died his home north of London on yesterday.

[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:17.980]
He was 70.

[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.800]
And they go through the whole thing about his early films and about, you know, 2001, a space holiday.

[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.520]
And then they get to a clockwork orange and they say, and they just, they just, you know,

[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.560]
just as you'd expect the mainstream media to do with a great movie like that.

[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:37.440]
And well, I was very controversial and he was, you know, turned on by many of the public in the critics.

[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.740]
So when he came out with a clockwork orange and later on in his career, yada yada, et cetera, and so on.

[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.240]
By the way, Peter Sellers is dead.

[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.200]
I just thought of what you know that.

[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.660]
Dr. Strain Gloves.

[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:49.880]
Interesting thing.

[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.820]
A lot of people that were in movies that Stanley Kubrick made are dead now.

[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.040]
What does that tell you?

[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.360]
What other were, what were some of the other ones?

[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:07.940]
Oh, here it's got a whole list of killers, kiss the killing pads of glory Spartacus with Tony Curtis.

[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.840]
I love you, Spartacus.

[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.020]
Yeah, that was a very homoerotic movie, by the way.

[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.080]
Spartacus.

[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.960]
Of course, that's why Tony Curtis was in it.

[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.220]
Lolita.

[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.520]
Oh, that's, that's what they said.

[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.780]
That's where his whole thing started changing with that Lolita thing.

[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.920]
That's where the whole approach of his movie started taking a big turn.

[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:28.960]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.700]
I shouldn't have played that.

[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:31.860]
Barry Lyndon.

[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.960]
The shining.

[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:34.820]
Here's Johnny.

[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.300]
Full metal jacket.

[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.560]
And eyes wide shut.

[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.800]
Scheduled for release July 16th with the anxious Tom Cruise.

[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.120]
With the much overblown Tom Cruise.

[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.480]
Underlined the blown part.

[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:52.340]
So Stanley Kubrick dies just hours before Jotin, Joe, that's our pool question today.

[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:58.940]
Long after Joe, Joe, Joe has been, you know, his ashes have been buried there in Yankee Stadium on the statue and set up.

[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.440]
I don't know if you'll ever feel they'll be raving it.

[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.360]
See, they won't be watching Joe to match your movies.

[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.120]
But they'll be watching a clockwork orange now Malcolm McDowell.

[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.140]
He's still alive at least.

[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.860]
There's one for the good guys.

[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.520]
Of course, to show you can take all those droogues and still stay alive.

[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.220]
And you can listen to all that Beethoven even real loud and still survive it somehow.

[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:24.200]
My favorite scene in the movie was when they propped open his eyelids with a toothpicks.

[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.920]
Here's a mobile in Pompano.

[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.100]
Hello.

[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.600]
Yeah, Kubrick.

[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.220]
The best Marine Corps drill sergeant, Full Metal Jacket.

[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:33.420]
Yeah.

[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.800]
The best computer hell.

[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.900]
The best satire ever, Dr. Strangelove.

[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:38.220]
Right.

[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.040]
And, you know, Dr. Strangelove was a seminal movie.

[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.980]
It showed us the absolute absurdity of our politics and our Cold War.

[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:47.400]
Right.

[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:53.500]
And, you know, unless you were from the East Coast, most people never have actually saw the man as you ever do anything.

[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:54.220]
Exactly.

[00:17:54.220 --> 00:18:00.620]
But people, once you're an old fart, I never saw him do anything because I, when I became a baseball fan about 1953, it already hung it up.

[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.100]
Exactly.

[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.780]
But so many people have loved Kubrick's works.

[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.480]
That it's gotta be covered.

[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:05.900]
Excellent.

[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:06.480]
Excellent choice.

[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.200]
Thank you so much.

[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.020]
It's unanimous.

[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:08.320]
All right.

[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.100]
Let's hear it.

[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.160]
Stanley Kubrick heads and shoulders above some stupid ball player.

[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.080]
Oh, but he was like, oh, I know the best thing.

[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:15.840]
CNN this morning.

[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.440]
I didn't know he croaked and I'm watching this.

[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.420]
And they come under breathlessly.

[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.600]
Don't imagine always dead.

[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.140]
We're like, oh, well, that's quite shocking.

[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.120]
Isn't that the surprise?

[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:24.620]
No.

[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.000]
You've been dying for months.

[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:31.140]
And so they get poor Kurt Gaudi out of bed, which Kurt lives up there somewhere in Palm Beach County, I believe.

[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.920]
And they get poor, old Kurt Gaudi just turned 110 by the way sounded, you know, for that age not too bad, almost coherent.

[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:44.420]
And it's obvious they just dragged him out of the sack and this brought on CNN breathlessly says, well, Kurt, here's Kurt Gaudi.

[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.560]
He's not for the Yankees, 1949 and 1950.

[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.600]
And of course, like that's a long time.

[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.800]
Kurt Gaudi known for being the Red Sox announcer and then for NBC for 100 years.

[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.120]
But anyway, it started out with Yankees and here they want to ask, who else are they going to get on there?

[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.140]
They're going to talk to Mel Allen.

[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.080]
I don't think so.

[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.240]
He ain't feeling too good.

[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:01.900]
Red Barber.

[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:02.920]
No, I don't think so.

[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.220]
So they got to get old Kurt Gaudi on there.

[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.140]
And now here's Kurt Gaudi.

[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.740]
Kurt, how did you find out about this?

[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.340]
Kurt Gaudi, can you hear me?

[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.680]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.800]
It sounded like one of our calls this morning on the worst team, one of those interviews.

[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.940]
And then he comes on and, well, how did you find out about it?

[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.000]
How did they break the news?

[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.380]
Well, your girl just told me.

[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:30.240]
I mean, the first 30 seconds of that interview, and I used the word loosely, was really embarrassing.

[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.220]
Nice going, Air CNN.

[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:34.600]
Here's Miami.

[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:34.940]
Hello.

[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:35.800]
Hi, Neil.

[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.360]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.140]
Mark and Miami.

[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:37.900]
Yes, Mark.

[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.620]
I got out of a coma from last week.

[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:45.720]
If I heard you correctly, which put me into the coma, that broke Daniels is one of the top

[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.460]
100 influential talks.

[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.780]
Yeah, that I think he's in the top five.

[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.820]
He's bubbling under.

[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.780]
But, but Neil, I think it's that wax that he's got all heated up.

[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.960]
It's bubbling under her recto somewhere.

[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.740]
And the major insults, yeah, I adore Bill Hendry.

[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.400]
Yeah, this guy is a genius.

[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.060]
Are you sure?

[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:03.560]
Yeah.

[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.520]
Even if he didn't make the list.

[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.480]
I know.

[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:10.160]
Even when it was a little about the talker's magazine and Walter Sable and all these ass

[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.100]
liquors, this little mutual admiration society of losers they got.

[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.560]
I mean, I want my name retracted from the list, by the way.

[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.280]
I want out of there.

[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:21.880]
Even with the lobotomy, Phil Hendry, yeah, even with the lobotomy, Brook Daniels couldn't

[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.500]
even hold.

[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.300]
Couldn't even sniff, Phil Hendry's talking about it.

[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.500]
I'm going to tell you something, because I worked with Phil for a couple of years.

[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.640]
Phil Hendry could fart, and it was funnier than anything that Brook Daniels could ever say

[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.520]
in her life, okay?

[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:38.440]
When you guys were on you, Rick and Studs and Phil Hendry, there was nobody that could touch

[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:38.600]
you.

[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.020]
I don't know why anybody screwed with the lineup, why they got rid of Phil.

[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.980]
I would listen to him for an hour from the time I got up to the timeline, you know, basically

[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:47.680]
to get off.

[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.660]
It wasn't incredible.

[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.300]
That's because the cops people didn't care about, they didn't care about people.

[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.620]
All they cared about was their goddamn bottom line.

[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.100]
I hope they rot in hell off there in Atlanta.

[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.280]
I hope that Bob Neill gets a bad bowl of grit and get something that rhymes with grit for

[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.920]
the rest of his life and never gets off the pot, little two-faced lion piece of crap.

[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.360]
Okay, that's like all the other people in this business, sir.

[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.220]
95% I'm serious.

[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.360]
95% of our full of crap.

[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:11.440]
Absolutely.

[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.780]
This is a crap business.

[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.640]
Well, I got out of my coma from that.

[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.380]
Number two.

[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:15.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.260]
What is this obsession with keeping these old people alive?

[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.900]
You know, that was 80 years old and on the brink of death.

[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.180]
That was 85 years old.

[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:25.960]
He had a lung out.

[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.400]
He was chain-smoking all his life.

[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.760]
Those goddamn cancer sticks.

[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:34.940]
I mean, they put dogs and, you know, they at least have you, you mean, uh, uh, uh, ways of treating them.

[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.840]
They should like my mother to care at Joe to measure.

[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.040]
If she would come out one day, they'd say, oh, I had him put away.

[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:39.900]
I had him put the sleep.

[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.520]
I would rather be put the sleep than to be put through that misery of being kept alive.

[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:43.940]
Right.

[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:44.760]
That's ridiculous.

[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.360]
That's right.

[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.780]
Number three.

[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.100]
Yes.

[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:53.720]
I have heard of, uh, briefly, you talk about Tom Lycus and I was doing some channel search in the other day.

[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:53.960]
Yeah.

[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:54.620]
I heard him.

[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.720]
He said he lived in Kendall.

[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.540]
So you must have worked with him or something.

[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.060]
Did you not?

[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:02.220]
Oh, I don't want to go through the time like his story again here because he lies about it through his teeth.

[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.300]
They brought him in here.

[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.720]
When I went from my WNW West, I.N.Z., they brought him in to be the replacement.

[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.580]
He came in here thinking he was a big shot.

[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.080]
They preempted me on I.N.Z.

[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.600]
The first rating book for a world series and playoff baseball almost every night.

[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.640]
So he beat me the first book and right away, he's making a big song in a dead.

[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.600]
He's a big star.

[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.180]
The next book I have seven share.

[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.840]
He I had a seven point one share.

[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.640]
He had a three point.

[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.180]
And uh, shortly after the book came out, he got in his car, put all his possessions in there.

[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:26.760]
It took off.

[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.900]
Seriously, there's a true story.

[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.660]
In the middle of the night, took off her Phoenix.

[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.100]
Didn't bother telling anybody who was leaving left town never to be seen again.

[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.180]
That's time don't like it.

[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:34.540]
Oh, great.

[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.280]
And have a great day, sir.

[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.120]
And it's a crap business.

[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.200]
And by the way, the guy that came up to me to hockey in the other day.

[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.080]
Bap, bap, bap, bap.

[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.400]
You know, can I sit down for a minute?

[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.240]
The guy with his Pam's jingles?

[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.400]
My hearing is fine, sir.

[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.400]
This guy sits down between periods.

[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.140]
John goes off to accrues the crowd in the hall or whatever he's doing.

[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.500]
And this guy comes over and I'll come out and if I sit down, I'm fortunately I said yes, because I'm weak.

[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.120]
And he's leaning over and talk.

[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:02.160]
He's like, as far from my lips are from the microphone and inch and a half, he is to my left ear.

[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:02.440]
Okay?

[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.100]
Wow, you know, those jingles, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:09.060]
And couldn't get rid of this man for love or money.

[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.720]
The Roger's done.

[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:11.500]
Rod Stewart.

[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.100]
Rocks Bad Boy is also a bad husband.

[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.440]
And now he's on tour to help pay off what's going to be won.

[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.280]
Hell of a big divorce settlement.

[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.740]
I'm saying now you're over money, sir.

[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.880]
I'm going to clean up your doors.

[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:27.460]
I'd ride.

[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.420]
He's on the road because he doesn't have a place to go home to anymore.

[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.200]
I don't hate you, I can't believe that he's gone to court.

[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:43.360]
The face of hell doesn't come so much than it's a day to come.

[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.780]
Rod Stewart.

[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:46.920]
The legend.

[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.660]
You remember the story about having his stomach pump.

[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.780]
Now he's about to have his wallet pump.

[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:58.920]
Some God has really owned some God has made child support.

[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.880]
Just cause that she don't use.

[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.800]
Don't need any God for court.

[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:15.580]
See Rod Stewart live in person, in death, on stage,

[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.940]
and I'm a hook for half of everything he makes.

[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:23.080]
You took my car, you took my home.

[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.240]
You took half of everything I own.

[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.980]
You took my car, you took my home.

[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.160]
You took my home.

[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.720]
Rachel's not going to miss him.

[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.840]
And neither should he.

[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.000]
At 33 at 5.60 WQM, we got Hank from Shoolestake 2 at 2 o'clock.

[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.320]
Boob Shambay with a big one.

[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.980]
You know, when you're big and fat, like he is, you can't do more than like a half hour at a time.

[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.600]
And to show either he's doing 6 to 6 30.

[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.380]
6 30 we got to pregame Panthers at Montreal that I plan to frog day.

[00:24:53.980 --> 00:25:04.740]
I could make some comments about, I'll say that for later, okay, about the Panthers situation and about Brian Marie B. M in the organization using his propagandizing tools in the media once again.

[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.100]
Oh, it's the fans fault, the fans in the media and all new people.

[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.360]
You're the ones responsible for Robbie.

[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.920]
You need him, our poor Robbie, the media, the people in the print media and the broadcasters.

[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.400]
You're the ones that are putting all the pressure on poor Robbie.

[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:23.180]
And that's why when they introduced him in the starting lineup on Saturday at the Macarena, he was booed the worst.

[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.480]
I've ever heard a Panther player player booed in the six years we've had a team.

[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:31.740]
Booed mercilessly in the start of the game and was totally useless throughout, by the way.

[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.340]
But VN comes up with this notion again.

[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:48.680]
I mean, are we dealing with a bunch of little children here or are we dealing with profession athletes that are making millions of dollars a year expected to go out there and do a job, have been highly touted by the same people who are now protecting them who tried by the way to trade them desperately before the season started.

[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.440]
Anybody remember that?

[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.360]
Anybody remember?

[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:50.900]
Yeah.

[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.860]
So somebody faxes me all the Stanley Kubrick stuff, by the way.

[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.120]
One of the most consistently interesting filmmakers of last 30 years.

[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.940]
Stanley Kubrick has seen his work praised and danned with equal vigor.

[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.940]
Justice is singularly brilliant visual style as one of great acclaim.

[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.900]
His unconventional sense of narrative is often elicited critical scorn.

[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.720]
Above all, he's remained a unique artist in the meat why they didn't like the dialogue in the 2001.

[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.200]
Above all, he's remained a unique artist in the meat and dominated by repetition and imitation.

[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:29.080]
If his ambitious vision is at times exceeded his capacity to satisfy the demands of mainstream filmmaking, this chink.

[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.080]
I don't know if he was Chinese.

[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:37.000]
This chink and his aesthetic armor only serves to highlight the distinctiveness of Kubrick cinema.

[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.340]
For a minute, I thought I said his atheistic cinema.

[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.100]
Well, it must have been atheistic to put out stuff like Lolita and had goddamn clockwork orange.

[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.820]
Yeah, clockwork orange adapted from the novel by Anthony Burgess.

[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:55.080]
No critic could take an uncommitted stance toward this film about a violent and immoral punk Alex Malcolm McDowell,

[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.860]
whose ruthless behavior is reconditioned by the equally diabolical state.

[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.800]
Kubrick's camera moved without density, unrivaled and contemporary cinema,

[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.060]
and his reputation as a filmmaker in total control of his craft was firmly established.

[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:13.200]
We got pages and pages and pages about clockwork orange and about Dr. Strange Love,

[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.120]
or how I learned to stop worrying about love the bomb and about Lolita, etc. and so on.

[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.700]
One of the great filmmakers in the history of the human race has died and who are they worried about?

[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.820]
F and Joe DiMaggio. That's what's worried about on this station.

[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.640]
They wouldn't know Stanley Kubrick from Stanley Jade Cohen. That's the problem here.

[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.140]
5 6 7 0 5 60, 0 5 60 on a mobile one line.

[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.380]
Phone to her is dead as Joe DiMaggio and Stan Lee Kubrick.

[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.380]
So anyway, getting back to the big concert Thompson is joint today.

[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.200]
So I'm sitting here this morning about quarter to ten.

[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.660]
I've already seen Little Maddie Bell, the food Nazi on the elevator coming up this morning.

[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.760]
Doesn't say anything to me to usual nice cities. You know, have a nice day.

[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.520]
How's your weekend? You know, that's the.

[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.980]
So it goes in there with George and I hear, that doesn't come anywhere near me.

[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.640]
What's the big controversy? Well, maybe it was a third year Friday morning that we played this tape.

[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.220]
We played this fake orgasm tape.

[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:16.160]
Well, come to find out that this was done by somebody who works in a club that I guess is a sponsor on Power 96.

[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.300]
Am I getting warm so far? And they were paid. Are you ready for this?

[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:27.620]
This is the same station at Caniford bumper stickers that gives us no promotion that pays all the underlings like two and a half bucks an hour that can't pay their bills.

[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.760]
This is the same station, but they paid somebody to do a fake orgasm.

[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.440]
And I'm sure that most of the guys in this audience know that, you know, they can get plenty of those for free.

[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.660]
So we played it on the year the other day on unaware of those.

[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:49.020]
So many comes down here to be seats. George doesn't come to ask me what I'm not playing again.

[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:55.460]
And the reason they don't want to play it again because the person who did this recorded this fake orgasm for Power 96.

[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.440]
I wonder if one of the people from the morning show was getting a encouragement while she was doing a recording.

[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.680]
I can't say which one.

[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.020]
But at any rate.

[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.940]
So they pay them a talent fee and now they heard that we played it on this show.

[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.920]
They want Q a M to pay a talent fee for fake orgasm.

[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.540]
Yeah, so will we please not play it anymore? Okay, we won't play it.

[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.740]
Well, no, I'm not going to. I mean, Jesus Christ anybody could go like that.

[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.120]
I'm going to pay somebody for that. No freaking way man.

[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.900]
This is the controversy at WQA.

[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:35.180]
This is the place that's got a lawsuit's flying. They got all kinds of serious stuff going on.

[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:39.740]
They're worried about some bitch that wants to talent fee because she did a fake orgasm.

[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.380]
I got news for every bitch in the world that did a fake orgasm was getting a talent fee.

[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.220]
The woman of this world would run a goddamn universe right now.

[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.400]
Crazy crazy crazy people.

[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.180]
5 6 70 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.380]
We're just going to play we're get back to 13 Friday shows again.

[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.580]
Okay, play a lot of good music and we can always play.

[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:03.440]
Yeah.

[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.560]
We're the feeling in this audience for Joe Joe, the radio.

[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.060]
He's dead.

[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.300]
The obvious people in the history of freaking human race.

[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.180]
Anybody in this audience care on your sports station.

[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:17.820]
Anybody all fired up and pissed off about it and emotional.

[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.600]
Going to services about it now.

[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.320]
He's probably playing center field right up there and having right now.

[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.700]
He's right up there with Babe Ruth Lou Gehrig.

[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.940]
He is. He's up there and vinegar Ben Maizo who croaked by the way a couple of weeks ago.

[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.080]
They're dying like flies man.

[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.780]
All those great dead jocks in the sky. They're doing it.

[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.820]
Kathy well it sucks.

[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.960]
So what else is new?

[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.480]
Hello.

[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.100]
Well hello.

[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.800]
McCallie, how are things?

[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.240]
McCallie, it's so nice your father can't have custody.

[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.620]
It's a chest degree.

[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.640]
McCallie, don't put it deep.

[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.420]
McCallie, give your money.

[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:11.540]
It's too young money and just be had it.

[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.680]
McCallie, make them move.

[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.900]
But don't end up like any monotuchy.

[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.800]
And don't end up like that.

[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.260]
Adam, she's from here.

[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.440]
He's an elf.

[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.160]
Oh, smile, don't be.

[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.800]
Founty, don't be.

[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.120]
And that's the rubber.

[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.400]
Tell me, McCallie don't scratch or drink or restore.

[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.980]
Don't end up black drop, I remove.

[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.480]
McCallie, we're doing another stopper.

[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.360]
Just from different strokes again.

[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.680]
10.44 at 5.60 WQAM.

[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:44.940]
Here's our one call.

[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.500]
Here's a mobile in Cooper City. Hello.

[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.900]
Mobile in Cooper City.

[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.960]
Here's our one call.

[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:53.720]
Here's a mobile in.

[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:56.660]
Hello, Neil.

[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:57.240]
Yes.

[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.440]
How do you pick me up so quick?

[00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.400]
I had a...

[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.580]
Hey, you're the only guy I got on here.

[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.780]
It's another one of those days.

[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:02.900]
I had it on the other side.

[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.160]
I see the head writing on the wall.

[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.680]
It was on the floor.

[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.540]
I had to pick it up.

[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.480]
And the phone too, yeah.

[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.380]
Yeah, I'll vote for Kubrick.

[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.620]
I think it's a mad Joe somebody to be admired.

[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.680]
Well, because he was a good ball player.

[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.280]
Like so many people in the United States, we...

[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.560]
You know, he was turned into an icon for whatever reason.

[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.760]
Yeah, he turned into a...

[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.480]
So what does that mean?

[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.820]
Well, how do you turn somebody into an icon?

[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.120]
Through the media.

[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.660]
You know, through high...

[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.360]
It's a ball player.

[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:29.980]
I know.

[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:30.960]
It's a great ball player.

[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.940]
And you know, he's got a record and a couple of records.

[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.340]
But so what's the big deal?

[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.960]
I mean, you know, Stanley Kubrick was a great director.

[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:38.780]
Mickey Mantle's dead.

[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.080]
Roger Maris's dead.

[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:40.880]
Lot of great...

[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.900]
Lou Gehrig is dead.

[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:42.880]
Babe Ruth is dead.

[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:43.700]
A lot of great...

[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:44.640]
My cob is dead.

[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.780]
Lot of great people are dead.

[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:46.420]
But...

[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:46.420]

[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.880]
What wrote his dead?

[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.680]
What was 2001 to space Odyssey all about?

[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.720]
It was in Horton's dead.

[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.820]
I don't know.

[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.960]
It was a little pseudo intellectual.

[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:54.880]
Yeah, right.

[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:55.780]
It was very pseudo.

[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.180]
Clockwork Orange was...

[00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.840]
I didn't trouble following the dialogue.

[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.000]
What dialogue?

[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:01.660]
Exactly.

[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:02.200]
Yeah.

[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.800]
And, you know, I'm out of material.

[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.580]
The clockwork Orange, you know, when it first came out,

[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.640]
the movie had an ex-rating.

[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.100]
And so a lot of theaters, the mainstream theaters, wouldn't carry it.

[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.220]
And an ex-rating because all of violence in there?

[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.340]
No, I think there was a scene they had to cut out.

[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.440]
I think they had to cut out a part of the rape scene.

[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.220]
Wasn't it like it was 30 seconds or less?

[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.220]
It made it an ex-rated movie?

[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.580]
Yeah, but it wasn't.

[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.040]
Well, I mean, but you know, we still saw Malcolm McDulles penis.

[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.960]
We see worse stuff than that on TV now.

[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:31.320]
Yeah.

[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.680]
But I want to watch a clockwork Orange tonight.

[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:34.540]
Excellent.

[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:35.460]
And Neil?

[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.020]
Yeah.

[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:37.880]
In closing time, I've got your pump.

[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:38.620]
Would you come get it?

[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.720]
I like the Wii Wii.

[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:40.020]
Yeah.

[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.480]
Is that what this guy said?

[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:42.360]
I like the Wii Wii.

[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.000]
Something like that.

[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.600]
Then there was a scene where the woman at the old bag

[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.660]
that had the rocking ceramic penis.

[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.320]
Isn't that what he killed her with?

[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.480]
I think it was plastic filled with water.

[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.700]
Who is a rocking ceramic penis?

[00:33:58.540 --> 00:33:59.900]
What do you know about it anyway?

[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:00.100]
Huh?

[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.120]
I've seen it a hundred times.

[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:01.460]
Yeah.

[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.000]
I've seen it 50,000 times.

[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.960]
And the movie I saw a couple of times too.

[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.360]
Yeah.

[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.200]
She had a rocking ceramic penis.

[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.100]
This crazy bitch.

[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:09.520]
Okay.

[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.200]
She was doing her ballet.

[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.300]
She was in her tights.

[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:13.200]
You know, the cat lady.

[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:13.620]
Yeah.

[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:13.860]
Right.

[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.040]
And the cat lady, she deserved to get it.

[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:16.360]
You know what?

[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:16.980]
The cat lady.

[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:19.480]
Anybody that loves cats is full of my book.

[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.140]
Disgusting vulgar creatures.

[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.180]
Anti-social, anti-human.

[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.320]
People that dogs don't like.

[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.960]
They turn the cats.

[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.720]
And dogs like almost everybody.

[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.180]
So if you're a cat person that goes to show you,

[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.020]
you're a real loser.

[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.820]
Here's a cutlery.

[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:37.120]
Hello.

[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:38.900]
Got to eat cats.

[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:39.480]
Yeah.

[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.660]
I would love to minute your pictures then.

[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.760]
Well, I got one you can have real cheap.

[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:44.980]
No, I can't one myself.

[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.420]
No, I wouldn't give my dog away from nothing.

[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:46.780]
Okay.

[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.200]
Listen to your show last week

[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.540]
and you're talking about the greatest bands and all that stuff.

[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:53.780]
Yeah.

[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.360]
I tried to line them in a teenager's number one.

[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.660]
I took a poll of the weekend.

[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.940]
A little too young for that one,

[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.300]
but I do have a question for you.

[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.720]
I watched a show on, I think it was E.

[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.180]
And they spotlighted Grand Funk Railroad.

[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:07.800]
Yeah.

[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:08.840]
And they were good.

[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.060]
Man, they were awesome.

[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.060]
Yeah, they were great.

[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.000]
They were awesome.

[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:12.380]
And they were good.

[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.160]
No, they were Frankie Limer.

[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:14.420]
Really?

[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:14.720]
No.

[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:15.760]
Come on.

[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:16.360]
Thank God.

[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.860]
Oh, I'm just giving the zets to that guy that put Frankie Limer in there.

[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.140]
They should have been riots in the streets when this guy called a show on Friday

[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:25.280]
with that idiot or facts over that stupid line.

[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.160]
I never saw anybody get that much airtime, man.

[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.360]
You really talk to that guy like, what's going on?

[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:29.940]
Yeah.

[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.700]
I mean, he was, but he knew it's happening.

[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:31.960]

[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.040]
What kind of drudges he's on?

[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.520]
He knew his stuff, but he was a little off-based.

[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.180]
Where would you put Grandpa Murray?

[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.460]
See, first of all, let me say that the guy wanted to reduce it to a discussion

[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.920]
of how many hits so and so ahead.

[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.480]
Well, if you want to reduce it to that,

[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.440]
then Connie Francis must have been one of the top 10 recording artists.

[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.300]
Because she had old crap load ahead.

[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:54.880]
Just because somebody's got a lot of hits doesn't make them a great recording star.

[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.040]
Yeah, what about the BG's?

[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.060]
There you go.

[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:57.580]
There you go.

[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.900]
What a tragedy that is.

[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.940]
I'm telling you, where would you put them now?

[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.220]
The only seats in first.

[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.040]
Put who?

[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.140]
Grand Funker.

[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.020]
Top 20?

[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:05.540]
No.

[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.580]
Top 50.

[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.820]
I'm going to watch that show again.

[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:09.880]
I'm going to play kind of a toss.

[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.300]
I know I put BG, the BG's back in Guadanamo, back of the plane.

[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.420]
That's ride stick them on America worst.

[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.380]
They deserve each other.

[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.560]
Much of cheap passes.

[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.040]
That goes to show you how you guys have fallen by the way.

[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.160]
The Gib boys.

[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.980]
Got to fly an America worst on a chicken crate airline like that.

[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.220]
And take up the whole first class and have the airline make up stories.

[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.500]
To make you guys a bunch of big shots.

[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.860]
And boy, I'm telling you that when we walked through that first class cabin,

[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.320]
there was that smell, that stench in there, I shouldn't know.

[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.880]
It was the God damn BG's.

[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.380]
We have an open line in anywhere.

[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:44.560]
You name it.

[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.260]
We got open lines.

[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.940]
Maybe that's what we're going to do today.

[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.480]
I wanted it at the time.

[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.220]
Remember one day at a time.

[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.680]
Let's do one call at a time.

[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.220]
It's going to be slow.

[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.200]
It's Monday plus I'm driving to work this once.

[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:55.900]
It's like a holiday.

[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:56.980]
Where the hell did everybody go?

[00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.120]
I think they bailed out, man.

[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.900]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.740]
Pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.420]
Maybe they were pressions.

[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.540]
Maybe they're on their way to Joe D's funeral.

[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.300]
That could be it.

[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.380]
Here's a mobile and Kindle.

[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:11.620]
Hello.

[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:12.560]
Hello.

[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:13.660]
Yeah.

[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:14.020]
I'm Neil.

[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:19.820]
You know, on the sacred circle downtown, I got a great idea.

[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:20.220]
Yeah.

[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.620]
Here's what we do.

[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.740]
We have the guy who owns the land.

[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.800]
Donate the land to the Indians.

[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:28.340]
Uh-huh.

[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.080]
Give it to the Indians free.

[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:30.600]
Uh-huh.

[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.520]
And they build a giant casino downtown for us, Neil.

[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.060]
Yeah, okay.

[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:35.440]
Okay.

[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.280]
We're working on it.

[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:37.220]
Tell them tell them the mayor.

[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:37.920]
Tell them the air penis.

[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:38.660]
I will.

[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.200]
Okay.

[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:39.720]
Yeah.

[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.280]
Because you know what he said.

[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.080]
I like the we we.

[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:41.400]
Uh-huh.

[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.580]
Yeah, Dave County, they're strapped for money.

[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:47.500]
Maybe they can't buy a fine money for this and they can't find money for that.

[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.300]
And they're really tightened.

[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.360]
Miami is going bankrupt in the county as a whole.

[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.200]
That's where the nature's gone.

[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.440]
But hey, they're going to have the money to pay this developer to buy the circle.

[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.420]
Because we got to preserve our rich history here in South Florida.

[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.980]
By the way, the hero, which is always screaming about, you know.

[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:06.960]
All the divisiveness in the community and always bending over back with the panda to certain elements.

[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.960]
What they got a special a whole pandering section yesterday.

[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.640]
And by the way, your anti-semitism is really shown through.

[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.660]
Why doesn't the headline just say we're taking over now?

[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.280]
We.

[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.840]
As if as if there's Cubans over there that are running here.

[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.460]
I didn't know the night where the people were Cuban.

[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:25.700]
And guess what?

[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.960]
The Cuban still hates you.

[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:27.880]
I hate to break the news to you.

[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.440]
They still hate you like poison.

[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:29.600]
And.

[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:36.800]
A vanishing political force South Florida's democratic condo commandos are dying out.

[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.860]
That's what I'm looking for.

[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:38.020]

[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.420]
That's what it says right there.

[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.300]
Old line condo Democrats fade.

[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:48.660]
South Florida political force Jewish political power has declined overwhelmingly in dead county.

[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.440]
And a great deal and Broward.

[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:54.560]
Boy, the power in dead county is his spatic is what it says.

[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.580]
It is not democratic.

[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.720]
It is a Republican that's conservative.

[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.140]
It's a fascist right wing thing is what it says.

[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.600]
And it goes on and on and on.

[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.620]
Which I'll get into later.

[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.000]
Okay.

[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:14.920]
As the hero once again continues doing their best and by the way, I think I can speak for a lot of Jews.

[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.480]
We're very proud that we're not responsible for what's going on politically in this town.

[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.160]
We can leave that to somebody else.

[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:21.820]
That's what we're doing.

[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:22.360]
Exactly.

[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.740]
Especially what's going on in dead county?

[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:25.720]
You call that politics.

[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.560]
Here's a mobile in Tamarack.

[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:29.800]
Hello.

[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.220]
Mobile in Tamarack.

[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:34.660]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:35.760]
Hold on.

[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.000]
I was just getting the car.

[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.020]
How you doing pal?

[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:38.620]
Take your day.

[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:39.100]
I'm back.

[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.160]
Lots of time today.

[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:40.500]
Yeah.

[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.680]
Well, not so much time.

[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.920]
We got another stupid ball game tomorrow.

[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:43.820]
Oh, no.

[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:44.360]
Yeah.

[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.080]
Well, it's not a watching a no playoff hockey team.

[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:48.700]
Yeah.

[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:48.960]
Yeah.

[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.800]
Anyway, something's going on that you need to hear about.

[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.100]
I don't know if you know about it.

[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:58.540]
If you noticed it on the i95, they're changing some of the signs to make the letters bigger.

[00:39:58.780 --> 00:39:58.980]
No.

[00:39:59.320 --> 00:39:59.440]
No.

[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:00.840]
They're making it bigger for people.

[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.760]
That's the blind people.

[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.140]
That's right.

[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.420]
For the people that can barely see that.

[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.120]
Yeah.

[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.200]
Instead of telling you, you know how to drive.

[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.660]
They're making the signs bigger.

[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:07.920]
Right.

[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.240]
At the risk of the lives of everybody else on the road.

[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:11.640]
Yeah.

[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:12.820]
I mean, it's ridiculous.

[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:14.740]
It's the mentality down here.

[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.100]
The condo commandos are taken over.

[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.380]
No, you're wrong.

[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.700]
The condo commandos are dying.

[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:21.880]
Are you better get the hair all pal?

[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.460]
You're way behind the times.

[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.820]
Condo commandos are dying out.

[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.220]
This guy doesn't understand it.

[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.020]
It says right here.

[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.160]
Jewish political power has declined overwhelmingly in Dave County into a great deal in Broward.

[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:44.720]
Said veteran South Florida political consultant Phil Hammer Smith would tribute the vanishing number of condo

[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.100]
and the

[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:45.220]
Democratic Party.

[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.300]
The president described as a silly joke.

[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.520]
The election year ritual of judicial candidates.

[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:53.140]
Shlepping to North East day to curry favor within electorate that no longer really exists.

[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.160]
The power in Dave County is Hispanic.

[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.120]
Camerasmith said it is not Jewish.

[00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.340]
It is not democratic.

[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.360]
It is Republican.

[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:01.560]
It is conservative.

[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.480]
And that is growing larger while other groups are growing smaller.

[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.660]
How do you like that?

[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.900]
So the Harold wants you to know the good news.

[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.540]
The Jews are moving out.

[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:12.520]
They're dying out.

[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.400]
They're dying great.

[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.480]
And all of us.

[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.300]
That's what they're saying.

[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:16.400]
They're all of us.

[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:16.860]
Cubans.

[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.520]
We're taking over.

[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.560]
It's our turn now.

[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.440]
Are the Cubans buying it?

[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:21.640]
No.

[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.560]
They hate the Harold.

[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.480]
They wish you would die at the Harold.

[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.020]
They hate you like arsenic.

[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.520]
At the goddamn Harold.

[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:28.900]
Okay.

[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.620]
And you're still bending over backwards.

[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.320]
They got 15 carapractors on staff over there because they're branded backwards.

[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.540]
So God, they're much the panda to a constituency.

[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:40.860]
That number one doesn't buy their newspaper and number two hates them like poison.

[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.220]
But short of that.

[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.360]
So when I read you that great letter to the editor from the hero by the way.

[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.620]
About Bill Bradley and how he's qualified to be president because of all of his years in the NBA.

[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:52.840]
So we know we can trust him.

[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:53.820]
There you go.

[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.000]
Just like how about latrine, free well.

[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:56.340]
Okay.

[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.920]
Let's make him goddamn president.

[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:01.500]
We can trust him to choke it and speak in the choking by the way.

[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.680]
How about that nanny story coming back on 60 minutes again last night again.

[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.060]
Oh my god.

[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:07.880]
See their desperate.

[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:09.780]
They're desperate.

[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:10.220]
You know what?

[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.520]
And of course there's some of the other ones like MSNBC.

[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.620]
They're still clinging your rapist rapist.

[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:15.900]
You know, he's a rapist.

[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:17.520]
Bubba.

[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.620]
But you know, but short of that.

[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.520]
They got nothing on because this other thing is over.

[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.720]
Somebody forgot to tell some of the people it's over, but the impeachment is over.

[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.720]
So we got John Bennett and now we got the nanny back.

[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.280]
I wouldn't be surprised to allow me for old J comes back.

[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.340]
Yeah.

[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:37.200]
We'll find another goddamn glove or some other bloody goddamn thing.

[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.020]
Here's my nanny.

[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:40.240]
Hello.

[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.480]
How's that mean?

[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.160]
Yes sir.

[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.280]
It sounds like me.

[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:43.680]
Uh huh.

[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.540]
I can't believe that you like a clockwork time.

[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:47.080]
Why not?

[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.140]
It's a great one of the great movies of all time.

[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.020]
I come from Brent.

[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.080]
We still are not allowed to see it over there.

[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:52.660]
Still banned.

[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.160]
Well, you don't have to do anything over there.

[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:55.720]
Well, that's true.

[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.840]
I do a radio show in a national talk show.

[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.740]
And I can't believe you get away with it over here.

[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.420]
Well, that's because you have no freedoms.

[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.800]
You have no first amendment over there.

[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.560]
You have a bunch of pretty sissy's over there.

[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:09.380]
And the beast, the amazing part of it is on radio.

[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.600]
They can't say anything over there.

[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.720]
But the BBC, F and this and F and that.

[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.420]
I can't believe the stuff that's on the BBC.

[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.480]
That's okay.

[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.220]
Because there's a government saying it.

[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:17.380]
Yeah.

[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.580]
You changed my life.

[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:22.240]
You made me the most fine broadcaster in radio history in Crateport.

[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:22.700]
Really?

[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:23.280]
Yeah.

[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:23.440]
Yeah.

[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.140]
Because I, um, I had a tape of you on winds.

[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.200]
However long ago that was.

[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:26.600]
Right.

[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.680]
It changed my life.

[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.300]
And I, uh, that's what I want to do.

[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:29.620]
Good.

[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.900]
And, um, well, I don't really like it over there.

[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.100]
I don't blame you.

[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:37.160]
A bunch of constipated jackassers over there who refused to grow up.

[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.720]
I'm, I'm serious.

[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.360]
The British are silly people.

[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:40.900]
You know that.

[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.820]
That's why they're still hanging out of this wealthy crap.

[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.840]
I can't believe by the way you don't get, uh,

[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.180]
they're starving over there in their pen.

[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.640]
And they got millions and millions and billions of dollars

[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.760]
in the goddamn royal family.

[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.240]
And they're still crying and running and ringing their hands

[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.700]
about poor goddamn Diana.

[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.920]
What the hell did Diana ever do?

[00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.620]
Uh, she, she, she, she, she bent her head down and looked up

[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:00.320]
through her hair.

[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:00.700]
Yeah.

[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:01.000]
Right.

[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.400]
She did it really well.

[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.020]
And then the queen, she nodded.

[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.480]
Wasn't that wasn't that bloody.

[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.280]
Yes, we were there.

[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.140]
The old bag nodded there like, oh, there she is in the box.

[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.260]
The queen gave her a nod.

[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.980]
I would try to, I would try to satisfy the peons out there.

[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:14.800]
The dumb masses.

[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:16.940]
I went to the university where they filmed the clockwork orange.

[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:17.220]
Yeah.

[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.160]
And you know where he's lying on the bed and there's this sort of wooden chair

[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:20.960]
that's right next to it.

[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.300]
I was, I stayed in that room.

[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:22.960]
Wow.

[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:23.780]
That was my room.

[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.140]
Wow, how about there?

[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.940]
I can't believe that you don't get calls by the way.

[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.680]
I, I, on my show, I guess it's an embarrassment of riches over there.

[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.220]
Yeah.

[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.020]
If people don't actually know what they got in, in your show.

[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:34.840]
Of course they don't.

[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:35.700]
They're a bunch of dead heads.

[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:36.360]
They're terrified.

[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.260]
I'm going to tell you a story in a minute about people.

[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.460]
They're all scared of me like a bunch of pussy.

[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.220]
Well, listen, say hi to the queen, okay?

[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:42.700]
Callio.

[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.360]
You can kick my rear end.

[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.240]
Finally, a motion feature has been made that's hesitant.

[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:53.520]
Nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:57.680]
You must see this twa-dujubeir.

[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:02.980]
The star of the jubair from a clean director Bouchard de la Croix.

[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.320]
Based on their claim novel,

[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.260]
An Fathre de Puy, by Edward de la Maison.

[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.200]
Inspire by the short story,

[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.120]
for you, recognize it by a wood-winning note,

[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.900]
Jean-Kiergato de Puy,

[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.140]
based on original key paintings discovered in the part

[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:18.200]
of Oussi La Région,

[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:19.320]
by Finn La Région,

[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:20.580]
sharp de Bellevue,

[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.860]
the star of the jubair,

[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.720]
winner of the medalian's specificity

[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:29.220]
at the festival of the necessary historical cinematics.

[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:33.980]
Henri Alo di Parnet is a souvenir in his breakthrough

[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:40.880]
as an humble traveler living in the history of the jubair.

[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.720]
Jean Ciscar calls the history of the jubair

[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.840]
and true the force in the cellophane filmmaking genre.

[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.580]
Roger Ebert,

[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.660]
proclaimed to be the most gripping love story

[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.400]
since Jean Crivella,

[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:58.580]
who was in the saide-caire original with Pierre O'Teal.

[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.900]
Shefry Lyon says,

[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:04.500]
I have no clue what any of you are talking about.

[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.200]
Is there anyone who speaks English around here?

[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.460]
Come see the sleeper hit the display.

[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.680]
This is what our enthusiasm is.

[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.120]
Now playing at the Plaza Six Multiplacks,

[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:15.960]
right across from the big cookie shop.

[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.780]
It's a Lv. 303 at 560 WDQM.

[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.540]
Very deadly Monday here this morning.

[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.840]
Looks like everybody bailed out on us over the weekend.

[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:24.140]
Sorry.

[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:27.340]
Sorry.

[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:28.440]
Sorry.

[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:28.500]

[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.080]
Sorry.

[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:49.980]
Sorry.

[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:50.360]

[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:50.360]

[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:50.360]

[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:50.360]

[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:50.360]

[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:50.360]

[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:50.500]
Sorry.

[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:51.900]
He's the most serious audience with no Joe Dumasio.

[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.160]
If they stuck his body in their bed right now,

[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.220]
they wouldn't know who the hell it was.

[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.880]
Even though it was all the ugliest people in history,

[00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.320]
man, kind of very easy to recognize,

[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.100]
but nevertheless,

[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.440]
he quit baseball before most Americans had TV.

[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:04.520]
Right, that's right.

[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.960]
And so I thought there's a big cynicism about him.

[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.140]
What is the big deal other than Simon and Garfunkel made a bad mistake

[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:13.240]
of sticking his name in that goddamn song

[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.360]
and Mrs. Robinson, other than that,

[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:16.660]
what's the big cynicism with him?

[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:17.200]
I know.

[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.300]
I mean, I vote for Stanley Kubrick's D-Day.

[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:20.740]
Right.

[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.320]
I mean, he made movies that last forever.

[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:23.760]
Right.

[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.340]
And someone's going to break Joe D's.

[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.900]
And even if they don't, who gives a crap?

[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:31.520]
Right.

[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.680]
I mean, he was only one on one of 16 teams back then.

[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.740]
I don't think he could hold a candle to Mickey Mantle

[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:38.920]
and he's dead too, by the way.

[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:40.540]
Oh, it's so snow-martened.

[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:40.880]
Right.

[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.220]
You know, I'm curious.

[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.260]
Let's vote for Rocky Calabito.

[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:44.880]
Okay.

[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:45.640]
All right.

[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:45.980]
Yeah.

[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:49.500]
They're getting pissed off about this now.

[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.660]
They're getting fired up and pissed off about it.

[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.340]
Even though we haven't had anybody called,

[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:54.780]
so they give a crap about Joe D'Amaggio.

[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:55.940]
That'll be later on.

[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.720]
You know, I know that Hank has got all this nostalgia about Joe D'Amaggio.

[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.240]
He knew him, he interviewed me,

[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:01.940]
and dragged out that interview tape again.

[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:02.900]
That's fine, you know.

[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.240]
Because it's a sports station.

[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.300]
And we're supposed to be upset.

[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:07.540]
He was an icon.

[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:08.760]
Well, what is it?

[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:42.620]
Here is the Leah.

[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:43.440]
The Leah?

[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:44.640]
No, that is not right.

[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.020]
It is not how he pronounced his name.

[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:46.900]
He was in 2001.

[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:48.200]
Now what else was he in?

[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:50.840]
Like one other movie that I forget.

[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:52.420]
Like one other movie that I forget.

[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.460]
Who you reminded me of?

[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:55.680]
Who you reminded me of?

[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:55.820]
Who you reminded me of?

[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:55.820]

[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:55.820]

[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:55.840]
Who you reminded me of?

[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.440]
Who you reminded me of?

[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:56.740]
Who you reminded me of?

[00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:58.140]
Who you reminded me of?

[00:53:58.180 --> 00:53:59.220]
Who you reminded me of?

[00:53:59.300 --> 00:53:59.980]
Who you reminded me of?

[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:03.300]
Who you reminded me of?

[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.020]
Who you reminded me of?

[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:06.760]
Remember him?

[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.180]
I would put their acting abilities on about the same part.

[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.280]
You know, kind of like strains.

[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.020]
They always played like real strains, bizarre.

[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.260]
Cure Dalle is his name.

[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:16.280]
Now how did you pronounce it?

[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:16.800]
The Leah.

[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:17.960]
No, it is not the Leah.

[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:19.360]
That is what I know.

[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:19.580]

[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:21.680]
God Almighty.

[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.120]
My guess.

[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:23.320]
Leave the Leah alone.

[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:26.280]
Here is a mobile in four-letter-dale.

[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:26.460]
Hello?

[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.880]
Mobile in four-letter-dale.

[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.300]
Going once.

[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:32.460]
Going twice.

[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:33.600]
Bye, oh, bye.

[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:35.000]
I ain't even left town.

[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:35.000]

[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:35.000]

[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.760]
I was here to even realize it.

[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:38.600]
Dr. Syvago.

[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.700]
Dr. Syvago, he was in Cure Dalle.

[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.780]
And how did they pronounce his name?

[00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:45.240]
Come on, somebody tell us how your pronoun is.

[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:46.760]
His name is not the Leah, okay?

[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.080]
If anybody calls you and says that his last name is for Nance de Leah,

[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.300]
I'm getting up and walking out.

[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.000]
I can't be that stupid.

[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:54.600]
Can I?

[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.700]
Here's a mobile in-boying V.

[00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:57.000]
Hello?

[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:01.080]
Please don't make fun of our pyjons from New York.

[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:04.980]
Like Joe DiMaggio or Amitino or Robert de Mignolo.

[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.780]
Amal and Brando.

[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.220]
Or Vito Coneo.

[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:08.600]
Yeah.

[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:12.300]
I never make fun of Dutch children or Maya Lanski.

[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.200]
Or Saluts O'Hia.

[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:14.420]
Yeah, please.

[00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:16.080]
Leave Joe DiMaggio.

[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:16.780]
What about Warren Beatty?

[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:17.980]
What?

[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:21.040]
Okay, we have an open line in a Broward 2 in-date.

[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:25.700]
567-0560-0.560 on the AT&T wireless line Delay.

[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:27.260]
Poor Delay.

[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.540]
Well, I was closer than you were.

[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:30.540]
Yes, Delia.

[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:31.500]
Whatever.

[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.480]
What kind of a pansy sounded.

[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.280]
How's Mr. Delia doing?

[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.580]
That's just really bad.

[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:38.980]
Here's a pay phone in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:39.200]
Hello?

[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:39.980]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:40.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:40.980]
How you doing?

[00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:41.600]
Okay.

[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:42.840]
Hey, real quiet.

[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.460]
Neil, you got a live and you got dead.

[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.440]
Is there any in-between?

[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:47.860]
Meaning what?

[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:51.060]
Well, I mean, the first time I was in a roast belt,

[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:51.920]
I was a match of dead.

[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:52.580]
Were you alive?

[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:53.980]
No.

[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:55.540]
Then you must have been dead, right?

[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:01.860]
So why do people say before I was born as the saying...

[00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:02.120]
I don't know.

[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.620]
Why don't you take a survey and call us back and let us know, okay, sir?

[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:09.040]
Never really thought too much about Eleanor Roosevelt masturbating when he came right down to it.

[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:13.500]
Two open lines in-date all of Broward, 700 open lines,

[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:17.840]
567-0560-0.560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:18.460]
Deadly.

[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:19.900]
Here's Wifechester.

[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:20.340]
Hello?

[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:21.540]
Hello?

[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:22.100]
Yes?

[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:23.700]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.100]
I got an anniversary, my own.

[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.560]
I'm celebrating the year of listening to you.

[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:28.840]
Well, listen, that's sweet.

[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.600]
I can't believe I'm 36 years old.

[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.440]
I've been here in Miami all my life.

[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:37.980]
And I actually stumbled across your show

[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.020]
because your station does no promotion, you know?

[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:40.800]
Right, that's right.

[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:44.820]
We can afford to be paying some credit or some club to do a fake orgasm.

[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.960]
I don't know.

[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:49.860]
I was talking about age 6, but we can't afford to go out and do any promotion.

[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:54.460]
A billboard, anything, a pup tent, a sign at the goddamn Lincoln Road Mall, nothing.

[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:55.920]
You're absolutely right.

[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:56.840]
I mean, it's just really...

[00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:00.500]
Every time I think about this place, I get so depressed.

[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:02.620]
Every time I think about the people that I work for,

[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:05.340]
and I'll absolutely dull and retarded they are.

[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:06.680]
Dull and retarded.

[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:08.160]
And you can't tell them anything.

[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:09.920]
They got all the answers, baby.

[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:11.720]
And they walk around in a state of denial.

[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:13.740]
Greg Reed actually believes, you know?

[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.420]
There are people who tell so many stories that they begin to believe them.

[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:17.360]
That's Greg Reed.

[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.660]
He tells so much bull crap.

[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.260]
He believes his own bull crap.

[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:20.920]
Who really does?

[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:24.300]
And I think you believe that at first, because, you know, he's more joll than everybody.

[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:24.640]
Yeah.

[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:26.060]
Now, that's beside the point.

[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:29.660]
Well, anyways, you were talking about cats before.

[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.240]
I never dreamed that I'd work for anybody.

[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.280]
Then you have to go to court every time you need to get paid.

[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:33.720]
But anyway.

[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:34.240]
That's sad.

[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:36.540]
That's not a good organization, you know?

[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:37.220]
Yeah.

[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.600]
Anyways, you were talking about cats before.

[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.160]
And a couple of years ago, I would have agreed with you, you know?

[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:43.600]
I couldn't wait to get my hands on a cat to do something better.

[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:45.160]
Yeah.

[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.960]
But a buddy of mine moved away a couple of years ago,

[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:49.400]
and he left me a cat, it was an indoor cat.

[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:50.240]
And I hated the animal.

[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:51.200]
I wanted to get rid of him.

[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:51.880]
I wanted to get rid of him.

[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.240]
I tried to get into everybody I knew.

[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.420]
And nobody would take him, you know?

[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:57.260]
And I treated him eating everything with that cat grew on me,

[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.740]
and he wanted to do it in my life.

[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:00.700]
And then I was just,

[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:04.280]
oh, I thought, you know, you have some life now.

[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:06.020]
Oh, my God.

[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.540]
I was telling you, I hated cats before,

[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:10.180]
but unless you had one that you lived with it,

[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:13.140]
I'm telling you, they are very affectionate, they're very sociable.

[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:14.700]
It depends on the animal itself.

[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.580]
You know, there are different humans that are in reality.

[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:17.280]
Whatever you say.

[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:18.320]
Hey, Neil, listen to me.

[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.100]
Do you simply play a bit,

[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.360]
I think it's called Neil Riders Syndrome.

[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:24.300]
You haven't played that in a while.

[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.020]
You think you can play that?

[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:25.700]
I'll work on it.

[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:26.040]
All right.

[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:26.640]
Okay, pal.

[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.300]
So I say how to old push.

[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:30.440]
Two open lines in days.

[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.860]
Five, and I'll pass on to push you.

[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:32.860]
Okay, five, six, seven,

[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:33.480]
oh, five, six,

[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:34.000]
six, eight, and five,

[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:34.840]
six, eight,

[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.220]
eight, and one was like,

[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:36.900]
I'm not in the cat.

[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:37.820]
So, okay, I'm sorry.

[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:39.360]
I don't want to see a cat.

[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:40.440]
I don't want to know from a cat.

[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.380]
Oh, as a matter of fact,

[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.140]
I went to the store the other day,

[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:44.560]
and I come home,

[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.360]
and I take my, I went to Walgreens.

[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:47.180]
Oh, yeah, that's right.

[00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:47.780]
Walgreens.

[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.020]
The shirts are carrying me fast this time, boy.

[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.220]
I mean fast.

[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:52.200]
Yeah.

[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.260]
Would you like to wait for that?

[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:53.620]
Sure.

[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:54.340]
Okay, here it is.

[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:55.400]
Yeah.

[00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:56.500]
Oh, man.

[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:58.600]
I straighten those bastards out.

[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:00.320]
So I get my prescription.

[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.040]
I drive home,

[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:01.680]
and it's like, you know,

[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:02.900]
I'm around seven o'clock in the evening,

[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:03.820]
one night during the week.

[00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:06.280]
And I'm on one of the side streets,

[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:07.440]
one of my, you know,

[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.080]
little shortcuts there to my where I live.

[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:10.860]
And here's the cat comes,

[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.280]
stops on the other side of the road,

[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:15.340]
and then goes running across.

[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:18.060]
It's the kamikaze run right in front of the car.

[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:20.000]
Oh, yeah, they do that a lot.

[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.540]
Like, am I going to force you to stop,

[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.260]
or were you know,

[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.300]
was that going to stop?

[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:25.620]
No.

[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:27.360]
Did I hit it?

[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:27.620]
No.

[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:28.760]
Damn it.

[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:30.320]
Did I floor it?

[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:30.640]
Yes.

[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.200]

[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.440]
running across the street in the middle of the night.

[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:43.880]

[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:13.860]

[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:13.860]

[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:34.360]
I'm not sure how you're going to do that.

[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:34.360]

[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:34.360]

[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:34.360]

[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:34.360]

[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:34.560]
I'm not sure how you're going to do that.

[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.140]
I'm not sure how you're going to do that.

[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:36.300]
I'm not sure how you're going to do that.

[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.060]
I'm not sure how you're going to do that.

[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:39.080]
I'm not sure how you're going to do that.

[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:39.980]
I'm not sure how you're going to do that.

[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.560]
I'm not sure how you're going to do that.

[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.260]
I'm not sure how you're going to do that.

[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:43.840]
I'm not sure how you're going to do that.

[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.200]
OK.

[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:45.280]
We could have a lecture.

[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.200]
You don't remember how嚼aly,

[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.860]
that was him, 2000,

[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.080]
he was in the picture with the,

[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:53.320]
uh, uh,

[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.140]
gee, I forget the name.

[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.600]
You forgot the name.

[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.660]
Well, the name of the picture.

[01:00:59.080 --> 01:00:59.480]
Dr. Civago?

[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:01.580]
Civago, believe me.

[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.640]
If you saw him,

[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:04.040]
do you remember him at all?

[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:04.540]
Yeah.

[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:05.620]
I remember him.

[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:06.260]
OK.

[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.400]
Really an X-flat.

[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:08.540]
Like Stavatson.

[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.080]
What ever is this?

[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.940]
like what about i'd like to do this but it's kidnilya the reason i know it

[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:16.840]
because i swam on interview show

[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:21.040]
and they have to do some care to leave me maybe the guy that was the do whoever

[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:21.320]
did the

[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.000]
me with what

[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.660]
but because you say so therefore it makes it so

[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.860]
no because he said so who said so

[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.920]
he said my name is cure delia

[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:40.000]
no no did he pronounce it he says it's certain did he say sir did he say

[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.880]
did he say his name

[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.920]
no they air thank you see did he say his name no so somebody else miss

[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:50.200]
the what difference is it make out of your pronounces name that i get a million

[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.500]
phone calls about okay something as trivial as meaningless as this

[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.980]
Stanley Kubrick is dead

[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:59.980]
jordan joda magio is dead after all these premature reports of his death

[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:04.000]
and this is what i get phone calls about so anyway the guy from britain

[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.220]
talking about the what you know people are in tibethe scared to death i'm at

[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:09.140]
the hockey game before the game

[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:11.800]
thirty-night if you rely on a hurricane game

[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:16.040]
and as i walked the halls if i go out to take a leak where i come back to the

[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.440]
sea most of those people like i've told you for years even though they know

[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:22.800]
often about the game that's my crowd those people are listening right now

[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.200]
that's the near Rogers audience at the macarena

[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:32.400]
so i'm walking back toward the inside toward my seat and there is it's before

[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.240]
the way before the game i just went and took a leak okay is it why i'm in

[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:40.420]
a title of that thank you and i'm walking back toward my seat and there's

[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:43.720]
like three young guys i'd say like i don't know 1819

[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:48.160]
and one of them and i can you know because you have peripheral vision

[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.040]
although if you're in florida probably don't have any vision but my peripheral

[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.120]
vision is pretty good especially when they look like that and there's these three

[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:59.160]
young oh there he is so either because obviously they all knew who i was so

[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.820]
either they wanted to say bad bad bad that i can't stand it or there are listeners

[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.900]
which is also possible maybe like closet type

[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.680]
they kind of look like they were on the closet and i'm picking up myself because i

[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.740]
saw it out of the corner my end but like point out it's that i said hey

[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:16.840]
Neil how you doing which most people do most people do who aren't a bunch of

[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.060]
pussy's guys like you three guys

[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:27.660]
why are so many people in this town pussy's just like that maddie billet

[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:32.280]
at one foot three inches tall that comes down this morning to be

[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:36.780]
seats George oh would we please not play that fake orgasm because she

[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.920]
wants a talent fee from q a m

[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:46.500]
and when you stop and think about this really i don't spend too much time on it

[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:51.100]
because you lose your mind but just stop for like 30 seconds and think about the

[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.520]
magnitude of this the idea that somebody who

[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.200]
recorded a fake orgasm on tape which you guys hear

[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.300]
probably most nights of your life

[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.880]
and and and not a very good i mean really fake

[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:13.620]
exactly really fake i think screw and could it on better net you know i'm saying

[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:17.720]
sure or was i'm sorry i didn't know that

[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.080]
well i've changed the whole maybe that's why they want to play it

[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:27.340]
oh seriously i mean maddie he now what does he he's the general assistant

[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:33.860]
division number four we got 450 salesmanager people ask me how many sales people you got over there

[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:40.020]
and my answer always is i don't know how many sales people we have but we have 75 sales managers

[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:46.260]
so you figure it out we got a door downstairs on the first floor in this building

[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:50.780]
that it's like electrically operated it's row it's spinning and rotating like a

[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:55.860]
cradle not the main entrance door this is a separate door it's the q a m

[01:04:55.860 --> 01:05:01.100]
slash power 96 sales hole door and they just spin them in and uh they come in

[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:05.000]
and they're out in and out in it like scotch warts he was here one day go on the next

[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:09.380]
and by the way how's fat boy doing he got the account he's got in the show

[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:11.940]
maybe he'll look with the thing

[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:20.520]
how's the thing we ever hear because you know what we're doing here at q a m we're hiring

[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:27.580]
all of these things that's right that we can find oh i'll tell you a minute why that Todd

[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:03.800]
that good in the first place but when it's a big imposing Hungarian guy like that you like to make

[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:09.760]
him nervous you know that's why we said those things sure it's it's fun to say all of these things

[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.700]
and then they get nervous like those kids at the hockey game and by the way all three of them did

[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:18.680]
look pretty good Roger time it's been a few years since Bruce Springsteen has released the CD

[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:25.340]

Craig Billington made on your armor yogger on a short hand breakaway to columnite of Pittsburgh

[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:03.340]

[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:07.320]
it's got this other guy that called before they know his he's got problems with this bag

[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:14.300]
so i was uh... i didn't hear you read the list so i'm i just wanted to confirm that and uh

[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:19.760]
keep all the great work okay thank you okay anybody else that stones concert on friday night no

[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:25.200]
no one guy that was so bitter also anyway speaking i'm glad that guy called about the buffalo

[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:30.740]
filigame was on six thirty last night so i get to my small dish and i look on empire at about

[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:34.300]
ten minutes till six because they got i'm going to tell you empire even though it's only buffalo

[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:39.360]
which is definitely the minor leagues their gigantic their heads and shoulders above this time

[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.900]
it comes to their coverage on that uh... empire thing and they got that show fan tv it's a good show

[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.980]
but it hadn't come on yet because i guess it was sunday so it didn't come on to a half hour

[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:53.220]
before the game usually around like an hour and a half before the game so anyway what have they

[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:58.920]
got on there they got high school wrestling now i have always said of course we know professional

[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:05.340]
wrestlers most of them are uh... you know like gorgeous George except for Jesse the body and we're

[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:11.640]
not too sure about him even though his wife talks a good game but i'm looking at he and i've

[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:18.860]
always said that high school and college wrestlers are a faggot okay and oh no you're wrong about that

[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:23.420]
that's a game club you moron i'm looking at this can't believe me they were both ugly unfortunately

[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:28.300]
but there's these two kids about i know seventeen high school kids and they get down on the mat

[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:34.620]
and the one who gets down on his hands and knees right and throws his spectrum up in the year

[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:40.400]
and the other one gets down on top of him grab him around the waist grabs him around the waist

[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:44.220]
and then they roll around on the mat together

[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:52.120]
ahaha yeah what is that that's a gate club you more sounds like it to me

[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:58.460]
and then if you ever noticed when those high school and come on you know the age they get a little

[01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:02.500]
bit excited i guess it's the friction every time they stand up there's like a yeah

[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:07.660]
like there was a little bit of excitement going on in there yeah right and sometimes there's

[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:13.540]
even like a squirt spot there must be perspiration huh that must be it right yeah little perspiration

[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:19.300]
What a fag, uh, thing that is wrestling.

[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.620]
That's all you people out there.

[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:28.040]
If Johnny comes home and says he's joining the high school wrestling team, just remember,

[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:31.080]
change those towels, pink, pink sounds good.

[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.780]
Maybe purple, purple would be good.

[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.520]
Here's a mobile in Palm Beach. Hello.

[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.280]
Hi, Neil. Good morning.

[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:39.220]
Yes, sir. Great.

[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:43.700]
First of all, I saw the Maggio play and I've watched Kubrick's film.

[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:46.560]
I choose Kubrick over Joe D.

[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.020]
Any day in the week.

[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:48.580]
Any day.

[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:50.620]
No, no, no. Any day, any month, any year.

[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.540]
Kubrick was a genius, so the Maggio was just another dumb jock.

[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.340]
Just another grease ball from New York.

[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:00.940]
One movie that really didn't get that much attention, which I thought was one of his best

[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:03.540]
was Paz at glory with Kurt Douglas.

[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:04.440]
Not the second.

[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.180]
I think he was the director on that.

[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.440]
Right, yes he was.

[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.180]
And it was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.

[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.040]
I've been going to movies ever since I was a kid.

[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:17.760]
And I thought it was one of the best anti-war movies I've ever seen in my life.

[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:21.700]
And I guess that's why I didn't get much play when it first came out.

[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.440]
And I think Douglas was great.

[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:26.860]
I think it should have won him a Academy Award, but unfortunately it didn't.

[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:27.120]
Yeah.

[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:30.260]
And the Maggio was a great ball player.

[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:35.240]
I saw him for the end of his career and he was still a very imposing player.

[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:38.120]
But I didn't think he was the greatest of that generation.

[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:39.720]
My mind, New Zealand was.

[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.180]
But that's another story.

[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.040]
What about Ted Williams?

[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:45.100]
Ted Williams was a great hitter.

[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:50.860]
But I think all around to speed for defense, the hitting New Zealand was a better ball player.

[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:51.320]
Yeah.

[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:52.820]
I could be prejudiced.

[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:53.800]
I've been a Cardinal fan.

[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:55.040]
He might be, yeah.

[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:59.580]
But for that generation, like I said, to me, New Zealand was the best.

[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.380]
You just said something about high school wrestling.

[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:03.640]
Now I got to take a fence.

[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:04.880]
I'm just fine.

[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:07.260]
I was a high school wrestler.

[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:07.780]
Uh-oh.

[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:08.460]
Okay.

[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:08.900]
Yeah.

[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:12.060]
And he's the straighter I think he is.

[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.680]
I mean, he's not really good at it.

[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.560]
He's always like the girls.

[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:18.700]
And I've never seen any indication.

[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:22.800]
I think painting a broad brush on all of these kids is really unnecessary.

[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:23.000]
Yeah.

[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.300]
We believe it.

[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:26.700]
Take care.

[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:27.460]
Bye-bye.

[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.080]
Don't count any grandchildren.

[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:29.760]
Okay.

[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:31.700]
We have an open line in the day to a broward.

[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.180]
And maybe adoption five six seven oh five sixty.

[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.340]
Pound five sixty on the 80.

[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:39.240]
If there's anybody in this audience that knows any.

[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:44.460]
Any guys that were high school or contact, maybe some of you would like to convince us, huh?

[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:45.920]
Am I going to believe you?

[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:46.200]
No.

[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:47.180]
But give it your best shot.

[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:47.560]
Okay.

[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:53.380]
Try to convince us that you're into wrestling, getting down on your especially the guy who's the bottom, if I can say that.

[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:54.640]
Huh?

[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:55.880]
What is that?

[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.640]
Who invented that?

[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.900]
What kind of a sub met the Greeks invented that?

[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:00.420]
What do you expect?

[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:01.280]
The starting position.

[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:03.380]
The authority Greeks invented that.

[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:04.020]
Why do you know?

[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:07.340]
That's why it centers around your.

[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:09.280]
Beckham because it was a Greek thing.

[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:10.960]
And they wrestled naked.

[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.180]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.300]
Thank God for that forskin, huh?

[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:16.440]
You can just imagine.

[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:21.540]
But just like that little immortal turtle at least they have when I was a little kid.

[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:24.020]
Every now and then with poppits, head out, you know, take a look.

[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.500]
Open line in day five six seven oh five sixty.

[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.360]
The pop five sixty on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.720]
Macho wrestlers, are we kidding here?

[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:33.980]
Oh my god.

[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.600]
Next we're going to be hearing about macho figure skaters.

[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:41.780]
When you come right down to it, we just think of all the different sporting events.

[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:44.560]
Divers, swimmers.

[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:45.260]
Oh yeah.

[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:46.900]
Where is that?

[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:48.700]
Thing I got.

[01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:49.260]
Oh yeah.

[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:50.920]
Sorry.

[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:55.840]
Divers, swimmers, ice skaters, figure skaters, huh?

[01:20:58.920 --> 01:20:59.980]
Can this.

[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:01.540]
Oh, gymnasts.

[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.100]
Whooo!

[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:04.820]
Flamers, scrimmers.

[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:09.440]
Hot looking young guys in tights and girls.

[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:13.600]
Lady golfers, wrestlers.

[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:15.920]
Wow.

[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.260]
I bet you there's just a.

[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:19.980]
It's a gay club you moron.

[01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:20.320]
Fingers.

[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.900]
Here's Miami.

[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:23.260]
Hello.

[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:24.000]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.920]
I'm glad you said figure skaters.

[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:28.120]
Talk about people coming out of woodwork.

[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.600]
Tiny of harding had something to say about monocle whiskey.

[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.360]
The news is really desperate.

[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:34.880]
I called the savior a couple hours at time.

[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.020]
HBO showed a movie called Lansky.

[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:38.780]
Please don't waste your time.

[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:40.460]
It's so vague.

[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.900]
And Richard Dreyfus is the flying Lansky.

[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:44.920]
Oh, I can't stand Richard Dreyfus.

[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.280]
I get the heave.

[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.980]
I get the wet heaves when I hear his name.

[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:50.480]
He's playing Meyer Lansky.

[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.720]
But the movie is so vague.

[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:55.060]
They don't really talk a little bit about Virginia Hill and.

[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:57.100]
No, like Jerry Lewis playing Abe Lincoln.

[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.240]
But please don't waste your time.

[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:00.080]
It is pathetic.

[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:03.140]
And the guy that gets it on fours, the guy that goes to get on top of him,

[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.060]
that's called mounting.

[01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:08.280]
No, get him.

[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:09.440]
And I'm going to tell you something.

[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:10.440]
I'm in my 40s.

[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:11.300]
I'm in my 40s.

[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.280]
And I'm going to tell you something.

[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.660]
Believe it or not, because I don't get into South Park and all that.

[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:16.200]
The beaversome budhead are really fun.

[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:16.900]
But let me tell you something.

[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.840]
They did one on high school wrestling one time.

[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.840]
And it was hysterical.

[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:21.180]
Oh, Jesus.

[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:22.380]
That's a fucking tear of me.

[01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:23.020]
Yeah.

[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:24.320]
Beaversome budhead did one.

[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:25.600]
And the whole thing was about big.

[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.740]
Then, budhead was on the four.

[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:28.800]
And the other guy.

[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.160]
And Beaversome hollering it.

[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:30.880]
The guy was trying to.

[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:32.460]
He was doing.

[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:33.580]
It was hysterical.

[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.480]
What do you think they call them?

[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:34.660]
But.

[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:34.860]
Correct.

[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.220]
Have a great day.

[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:36.660]
Thank you.

[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:37.180]
It bottoms up.

[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:38.860]
So it's called mounting.

[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.440]
I was in a Royal Canadian.

[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:41.360]
Mounties.

[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:45.220]
We have an open line of day five, six, seven, oh five, 60.

[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.500]
Hey, listen, if Roy Rogers could mount trigger.

[01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:50.420]
And pound five, 60 on the 18 T wireless line.

[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.500]
Yeah, the ancient Greeks.

[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:53.480]
They invented wrestling.

[01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:58.020]
And all those gymnastic events that you were talking about.

[01:22:58.100 --> 01:22:58.760]
All of these things.

[01:22:58.940 --> 01:22:59.220]
That's right.

[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:00.360]
And we know about the ancient Greeks.

[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:04.720]
That was used to say beware of ancient, beware of Greeks bending down.

[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.880]
Here's a mobile in the Coral Springs.

[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:08.280]
Hello.

[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:09.820]
Hey, B.O. How are you?

[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:10.320]
Okay, sir.

[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.300]
A couple of buddies of mine were golfing over at Eagle Trace.

[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:16.640]
They were going golf?

[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:20.600]
They were playing golf in Eagle Trace and they hit Jeff Rimmer's house.

[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:21.300]
Yeah.

[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:23.780]
One of the balls and Jeff came running out.

[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:28.780]
And for what I heard, he gave him a little bit of some washing and everything I grabbed.

[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:33.360]
But I guess the, I just wanted to just see just to verify it.

[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:35.260]
Okay, thanks for the good news.

[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.480]
Okay, we have an open line of day one and Broward.

[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:41.280]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound five, 60 on the 18 T wireless line.

[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:43.280]
Here's Miami Lake.

[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:43.620]
Hello.

[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.220]
Yeah, you knew.

[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:45.680]
Yes, sir.

[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:46.460]
What's going on there?

[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:46.940]
How much?

[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:50.520]
Well, listen, I actually thought I'd be getting an argument with you, but I just heard the last caller.

[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.480]
I also agree that the Kubrick death is a lot.

[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:55.920]
It's something more to mourn than the, the Dimaegio thing.

[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:56.660]
No contest.

[01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:01.540]
I mean, so far we had 7,282 calls every one of Mrs. Kubrick.

[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.580]
Seriously, I'm not one vote for Joe D.

[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:04.660]
I woke up this morning.

[01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:07.400]
I heard about Joe Dimaegio and I was like, you know, they kind of stinks whatever.

[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:08.240]
I guess he was sick.

[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:08.940]
I came to work.

[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:09.980]
I guess he was sick.

[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.760]
He's been having stories of his death for months now.

[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:14.140]
Oh, that's what I mean.

[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.800]
And then I come to work and somebody says, oh, did you hear also Stanley Kubrick die?

[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:20.940]
And I swear I almost like dropped because the guy is just as genius.

[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:26.320]
And I think I'm going to have to watch the shining tonight, you know, and sort of get the Kubrick vibe back.

[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:29.660]
But I also want to let you know I'm a Boston Bruins fan and we're going to come to town.

[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:33.040]
I get to cut Tuesday night and not you guys out of the play.

[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:33.140]

[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.220]
Yeah, I think it's Tuesday.

[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:35.080]
Not this Tuesday.

[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:35.720]
Oh, no, April.

[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:37.700]
I think it's like April 7th or April 8th.

[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:39.200]
Well, listen, man, whatever night of the week.

[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:40.180]
Well, that's not what you're trying.

[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:41.480]
I got to look forward to that.

[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:43.760]
I actually got to see the Bruins on TV this weekend.

[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:45.380]
And you're probably right.

[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:46.560]
It looks like they're going to make the playoffs.

[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:47.660]
But I will tell you this to me.

[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:48.360]
They're very boring.

[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:51.140]
Maybe that's because Dale Arnold is doing the games and I can't stand him.

[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:52.880]
He's the worst broadcaster in history.

[01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:53.440]
He's the winner race.

[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:54.320]
He is.

[01:24:54.780 --> 01:25:00.040]
I'm going to tell you going from Fred Qsick to Dale Arnold would be like going from Mel Allen to Goli.

[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:00.920]
Oh, man.

[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:01.900]
That's how bad that is.

[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:03.000]
Well, listen, he was good talking.

[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:03.600]
Yeah, like a show.

[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:04.680]
And good luck to you, Sivima.

[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:05.160]
You'll need it.

[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.520]
Say how to famous Ainess.

[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:10.520]
We have two open lines today, five, six, seven, oh five, 60,

[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:14.780]
pound five, 60 on the AT and Tim, glad we got the cure delay things straightened out.

[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.280]
And then we'll fart the call before that was so adamant.

[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.580]
And so I got today, I got you, guess what?

[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:21.280]
Raw.

[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.180]
Just like the people with that doctor's your vlog book.

[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:24.860]
Raw.

[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:30.580]
See, it takes a real macho man like me to admit when they're raw.

[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:32.020]
I often am.

[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.220]
But at least I'll admit it.

[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:36.300]
I'm not just a hard ass like that little pergilty.

[01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:38.660]
Oh, yeah, but feel freeze and I know he's not.

[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:39.360]
Oh, bye bye.

[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:40.120]
Now you're an asshole.

[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:46.040]
See, I would just remember one thing, a guy that starts calling names.

[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:50.000]
As opposed to dealing with the facts can't back up his fact.

[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:52.200]
Just remember one thing about that person.

[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:52.960]
He's an asshole.

[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:53.480]
That's right.

[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.760]
Not that I would call him an asshole, but he's an asshole.

[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:57.140]
He did.

[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.060]
Because there's nothing.

[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:03.340]
There's nothing worse than somebody who starts calling people names.

[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:09.120]
Like that little punk Maddie Abel, that little midget, that little puss, the food Nazi.

[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.600]
And whatever you do, don't play that.

[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:15.320]
Oh, now there's more money.

[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.040]
There's another hundred.

[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:17.360]
Ah, 150 bucks.

[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.560]
I've been in the business for 700 years.

[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:27.760]
And that to me, this is right up there in the top five of the silliest, most ridiculous,

[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:32.000]
most idiotic things that anybody has ever even wasted my time with.

[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:36.160]
Of course, they have a lot of embarrassing things that go on over their power 96.

[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:39.940]
We don't want to mention that Don Cox tape, which we do still have that somewhere, by the way.

[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:41.340]
Anybody want to hear that?

[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:41.700]
Uh-huh.

[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:43.480]
My winner doesn't whistle.

[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.480]
Oh,

[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.020]
about movement.

[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:54.980]
Now would be nice about movement.

[01:26:56.340 --> 01:27:01.680]
Has too much rights on my toilet.

[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:10.820]
Where I belong would be terror died.

[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:14.140]
About movement.

[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:16.920]
Finally begun.

[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:20.140]
I can't wait to see.

[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:28.220]
And my colon and him come in here.

[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:35.780]
I hold your breath from this moment on.

[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:36.840]
All right.

[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:41.140]
I don't know exactly where this is.

[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:50.040]
Maybe when I said nothing to part.

[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.160]
I would just have never died far.

[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:02.200]
To finally

[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:08.380]
I did

[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:11.760]
to do

[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:14.100]
about movement.

[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:17.140]
Now I'm in a rush.

[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.860]
I am finished.

[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:23.620]
I promise you this.

[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:30.180]
I can't wait to give it a flush.

[01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:33.380]
My down movement.

[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:40.860]
It's public to it.

[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:46.440]
By the way, for the 10 million time here's Jolton Joe to magio.

[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:47.260]
Any interest?

[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:47.640]
No.

[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:50.540]
So here's a fact that says.

[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:54.680]
My coworker just informed me he was a wrestler in high school.

[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:58.940]
He tells me what you explained about the positions is how the contest begins.

[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:02.540]
Now we also attended Columbus High during his wrestling years.

[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:03.880]
Does that all make him gay?

[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:05.960]
Is there any doubt?

[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:06.800]
No.

[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.080]
The positions.

[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:12.400]
There's the top.

[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:13.580]
There's the bottom.

[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:17.920]
And when one guy hops on the other one and they start the whole thing, they call it mountain.

[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:20.780]
Need any further explanation?

[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:21.080]
No.

[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:21.920]
I didn't think so.

[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:24.220]
God.

[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.100]
What kind of what kind of what is that?

[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:29.920]
What is it when you look at it?

[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:36.160]
I said seriously because I haven't seen that crap in years and I'm looking at thinking this is so

[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.040]
fake.

[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:40.160]
It is such a faggy looking thing.

[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:43.520]
And of course the object.

[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:45.640]
To pin the other guy.

[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:46.620]
It's to pin him.

[01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:47.820]
Tenelum.

[01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:48.660]
Yeah.

[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:49.380]
I can do that.

[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:50.640]
What's wrong with that?

[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:54.000]
Here's a mobile and cross spring.

[01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:55.580]
New God.

[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:56.160]
Yes sir.

[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:59.360]
I totally agree with you with that high school wrestling thing.

[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.260]
That is the gays.

[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:03.760]
That's worse than male cheerleaders I think.

[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:07.100]
But at least those guys are just about to get the you know.

[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:08.220]
That's what Trent Lott said.

[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:11.020]
And this Joe D'Amagio is saying struck me.

[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:12.780]
The funniest thing is on the S.P.

[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:14.780]
And they had that tape waiting to go baby.

[01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:17.280]
There is waiting to get the word.

[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:21.460]
That's why ESPN and CNN are just unleashing a barrage of Joe D.

[01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:25.540]
Crab now because they've had this in the can if I can say that for months now.

[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:27.720]
They're waiting and waiting and waiting.

[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.200]
They're opening to the east side on two weeks I think.

[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:30.500]
Right.

[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:31.000]
That's right.

[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:32.900]
Okay pal.

[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:33.940]
Let's talk to you.

[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:34.620]
See you on the mat.

[01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:37.740]
We have an open line and they know what they are.

[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:38.780]
How they get on the mat.

[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:41.780]
I wonder how Matt's feeling about it.

[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:43.960]
And Vanessa.

[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:49.660]
We have an open line and powered five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line.

[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:50.980]
I don't want you to feel bad.

[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:54.220]
But if your son comes home and says he just joined the wrestling team.

[01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:55.560]
Tom the pack.

[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:57.740]
Oh, we over the years.

[01:30:58.380 --> 01:30:59.720]
Here's a mobile in Fort Myers.

[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:00.080]
Hello.

[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.520]
Hello Neil. How you doing this afternoon?

[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:02.960]
Okay.

[01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:05.500]
Neil I rest over.

[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:06.660]
Will you close back in?

[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:06.840]

[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:10.240]
Well, I just filled in high school and college with your kind.

[01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:12.460]
With the gymnastics team as well.

[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:13.580]
Oh my god.

[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:15.540]
I'm not gay.

[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:16.500]
I believe you.

[01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:17.660]
We believe you.

[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:19.400]
Don't leave a little bit.

[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.140]
We hope for me Neil.

[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:22.200]
That's just a straight.

[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:22.520]
No.

[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:22.960]
No.

[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:25.680]
Oh lord.

[01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:27.160]
I'm going back down to Columbia.

[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:29.120]
You got any choice places where I had to go?

[01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:31.700]
Oh god.

[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:32.400]
Talk about it.

[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:34.220]
Well, that was I didn't realize that was from Fort Myers.

[01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:36.340]
Talk about a boring one note Charlie.

[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:37.220]
He's a faggot.

[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:39.200]
Yeah, you'll have a good time in Columbia.

[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:40.720]
Now to Corn, Metacone.

[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:41.600]
Yeah, they're all into that.

[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.140]
560, 7.0560.

[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.660]
Pound 560 on a mobile one line.

[01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:48.160]
Where is he boring?

[01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:49.760]
Here's a mobile at home.

[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:50.340]
Did hello.

[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:51.940]
And yeah, how you doing?

[01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:52.520]
Okay, sir.

[01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:56.480]
Neil, if you ever need a good night's sleep, you got to watch that HBO movie.

[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:57.200]
There are landscape.

[01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:57.660]
Yeah.

[01:31:58.180 --> 01:31:58.600]
It's awful.

[01:31:59.200 --> 01:31:59.880]
It is.

[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.700]
It's a combination of standby.

[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:02.700]
Auth your movie.

[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:05.660]
It's stressful.

[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:19.680]
You can get that movie by highmedem Aurora Suez now.

[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:29.680]
So when the operate in Gotham, it might have been a conversation about now but it's not

[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:30.920]
going to break.

[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:31.560]
Well, we'll be at WronnenТы now.

[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:31.560]

[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:31.560]

[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:31.560]

[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:31.560]

[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:31.560]

[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:31.680]
We're going to have a word called you move forth.

[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:35.720]
Frankie Lamin and the teenagers are like black bubble gum music. That's what that was

[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.140]
Sure on adulterated

[01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:45.140]
Open-line it-broward five six seven oh five sixty anybody ever wrestled at Columbus high

[01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:54.740]
Okay, let's see that that's ten strikes against the already in fact probably father O'Toole is the wrestling instructor where they're no doubt

[01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:00.600]
Yeah, let's get down and you need here Billy come on. Let me show you how to do it on the mat. You'll be the bottom. I'll be the top

[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:03.780]
It's mounting time at Columbus high

[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:10.960]
Here's a mobile in Okitobi. Hello. Hey, this is kept yesterday. I really enjoy it

[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:13.800]
I wrestled in high school and I can tell you

[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:15.880]
The top is sport

[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:19.320]
Out there. I played football up until ninth grade

[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:22.300]
But wasn't big enough to play play on the hot school team

[01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:29.400]
So then I got in the wrestling you can actually it's one-on-one one-on-one sport where your wrestling somebody that's your actual weight

[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:35.400]
So it really works out to where whoever's the best athlete will win. Yeah, but I think it's good that they you know

[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:38.960]
They paired the little guys with the other little guys, you know, well, I'll tell you this

[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:41.100]
I can't even get a date my senior year

[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:46.940]
I've been with almost every winch in my high school. I had sex a bad reputation and none of us guys were fags at all

[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:49.400]
I'm just I'm here to tell you it's a great sport

[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:57.560]
Yeah, it is a great sport. I believe you but I don't know if anybody does on my team that was gay and we probably would have took him out in

[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:04.720]
If you were yeah, so that's that's my take on so okay, thanks. We believe you. Do we believe him? No, no, I'll fag it

[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:11.400]
Okay, medical on what or George is catching ants by the way in the other room. Do we still we have an exterminator yet? No

[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:21.740]
Like I said a radio company a multi-million dollar radio company that doesn't even afford that won't spend a few bucks once a month

[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:26.120]
For an exterminator to come out and spritz a little bit with his big can

[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:33.240]
There are a bunch of cheap bastards is what they are okay. It's the beastly greed effin way cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat

[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:37.680]
We can afford to pay some bimbo to oh, yeah

[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:43.680]
Man am I emotional about that are you emotional? No bad really bad fake

[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:46.580]
My minting could have faked it better than that

[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.560]
But we can afford to pay some bitch talent fee to do that

[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:56.500]
But can we afford an exterminator to come here and keep this place like sanitary no so anyway, let me think about Todd Dreck

[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:00.280]
Oh, I got to do a spot first. Well, it kind of ties right in

[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:08.740]
There's nothing like the smell of fine paint on a lazy Saturday afternoon to get high on that's right

[01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:16.980]
Knipping paint is a great way to unwind on the weekend forget all the chemically engineered neuro stimulants those crazy self-American drug lorther designing

[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:18.760]
This is the real thing

[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:22.400]
This is a little bit in an imp in a

[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:24.560]
Not money

[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:27.800]
But I can stay away girlfriend

[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:28.320]
girlfriend

[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:36.820]
Forever when you want to kick back relax and fry your brain to big and bits pick up a good old gallon of wallpaper

[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:39.280]
I need to pee myself

[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:41.160]
He's available

[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.920]
214 to 560 WQM just to remember one thing something that somebody in college told me a Michigan state about a hundred years ago

[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:52.200]
It's not important in life that you succeed, but that your friends fail

[01:35:53.340 --> 01:36:00.500]
I'm surrounded by that. It's not important that you succeed, but that your friends fail especially when it comes to their health and their fat

[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:03.880]
I've been back. This is one week today

[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:09.660]
I wish you go today came back on here from vacation and starting right when I walked in and please don't tell me about good intentions

[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:13.100]
About what a ruthless bastard. I'm the problem is I'm too nice of a guy

[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:15.580]
That's the problem that I keep my mouth shut

[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:20.800]
But as of today I'm gonna start making a scene anytime anybody

[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:27.040]
Makes available to me all this poison that kills me all these refined carbohydrates

[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:33.560]
Candy and cookies and biscotties and crap last money I come back. Oh happy anniversary. No

[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:37.360]
Here's a bunch of stuff to take home and kill yourself with and I did

[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:44.260]
And then you know as the week progressed and Thursday night we had the fat-rich episode of the track

[01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:47.580]
Well, how about a nice big piece of chocolate cake with a big piece of chocolate

[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:50.120]
Fingered ice cream with it. There you go

[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:54.660]
And then Saturday night at the hockey game

[01:36:56.580 --> 01:37:03.020]
You see it I know it's it makes me seem like a real prick when I'm knocking people who think that they're doing nice things and

[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:09.380]
And a woman these people you know can all they just been in Toronto they were there for that closing game and maple leaf gardens

[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:14.060]
Bring me a big Manila folder and inside the folder here's the

[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:20.220]
Program from that night and maple leaf gardens. Here's the maple leaf your book. Here's some other stupid magazine about Toronto

[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:23.620]
That's in all hotels that I see but anyway here's the because they're they're trying to be nice

[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:26.920]
But also in the bag here's two big boxes of smarties

[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:32.680]
That just happened to make their way out on the table last night

[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:38.000]
And I'm in public yesterday afternoon

[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.300]
I made two trips to my publics over the weekend. Did I buy one shred of anything evil?

[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:48.700]
No anything with a fine carbohydrates no candy no ice cream no cookie. Anything no

[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:54.780]
But I'm in the store on the yesterday yesterday afternoon and here's one of my neighbors

[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:57.140]
Of course, you know a couple of houses down across the street

[01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:02.540]
My Italian lady neighbor who is a very nice person in her own bizarre way

[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:06.360]
She's there with her pudgy son who's a nice kid but needs to lose some weight

[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:11.760]
And I'm sure she's for speeding Italian food, but at any rate they're all nail-ass. Oh boy

[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:15.580]
Cuz she can pop pop pop pop pop this woman can talk up a store

[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:19.260]
She will stop in the middle of the street on my street in her car

[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:22.040]
And if she sees you like in the in the driveway

[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:28.140]
Getting ready to close the garage door. She will keep talking until you close the garage door and you're inside

[01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:33.480]
And then you go inside the house and if you open up the window you'll hear she's still out there talking

[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:39.820]
Bapapapap I mean nice person but a Yanta Bapap. Oh, and I brought home these wonderful Italian chocolates from Italy

[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:44.960]
filled with caramel and you know and you've got to come to the house for a great Italian meal and I'm saying no

[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.140]
Please just let me away. Please no

[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:54.440]
And so of course that I did I mentioned Todd the Dreck I forgot about that part

[01:38:55.080 --> 01:39:00.220]
Which we had food from our good friends in that's an otay which was delicious and he brings the menu in here on

[01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:06.300]
Whatever day it was George picked out what he wanted I picked out what I wanted very specific instructions

[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:11.880]
No bread no pasta no desserts Neil can't eat him. He's on the atkins. He's diabetic

[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:15.180]
Diabetic you understand diabetes you got it no

[01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:21.140]
In fact, I'm convinced beyond a shadow but I in fact my dermatologist is a hockey concert

[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:24.640]
It brings me the report on my biopsy. Did they find out anything? No?

[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:32.560]
I'm convinced it's from fat from sugar from all this crap. I've been eating I've been killing myself with for months

[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:39.580]
Pints and pints and pints of fish moon all the other Ben and Jerry's and ice cream and candy and cakes

[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:42.460]
Oh, which I left out the cake on the anniversary date to by the way

[01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:47.580]
Not just the biscotties to take home, but a huge cake the there the size of Delaware

[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:51.680]
Seriously, there are actually towns in America smaller than the cake

[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:59.920]
So Todd when it brings in our pison from a metronauta here on Friday and here's your meal and guess what?

[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:05.680]
Here's all a bunch of angel there pasta too pasta Pomodori. It was pretty good. I stand here eating it and

[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:09.780]
My blood sugar is soaring rising

[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:13.140]
Rampedly I'm telling you I wake up two o'clock in the morning this morning

[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:16.260]
I thought the world was my life was coming to an end

[01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:19.720]
I thought I was gonna beat out a Joe to Maggio by hours

[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:25.460]
Right on the heels of Stanley Kubrick. It's oh god. It's the big one

[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.920]
And I know you've heard you've heard this crap until it's come out of yours

[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:35.360]
I don't care because there were a lot of you out there that suffered the same thing and you refused to open up your mouth about it

[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:40.600]
I'm the only one so now I'm gonna be a real son of a bitch about it if you bring me anything that I can't eat

[01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:35.860]
Yeah, so guys like us we ran track

[01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:41.320]
Could be on a baseball team because you had that orange head and they kept thinking it was orange baseballs that we're using that kept swinging at your head. Yeah

[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:51.780]
That anyway, it was horrible what one part didn't you like well with you know what a crime you're a victim

[01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:57.240]
No, do you know what a cross face is a cross face a cross face is what a guy

[01:52:57.240 --> 01:53:01.100]
Drags his arm across your face. I know that Monica said she gave good face

[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:05.580]
And your nose is right in his armpit. Oh

[01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:09.460]
Child is Christ, so we wrestled schools like Ealy

[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:14.980]
Or boy de Anderson. Oh, I understand Ealy's got the the smelliest armpits by the way

[01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:19.940]
Yeah, it was the most this and then the mat would get all sweaty

[01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:24.760]

All the chronics today here's Dave the cup another chronic. How you doing?

[01:53:56.740 --> 01:54:01.220]
Okay, a great article in today's paper the Harold Cal Thomas wrote in the about

[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:07.140]
Your friend Monica Lewinsky not interested the lady is a child. Thomas is a fascist

[01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:10.840]
Yeah, you're right, but he may make sense on this one not interested in anything there

[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:13.220]
How can you pick and choose with Cal Thomas? Oh?

[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:20.020]
This caught the eye more so than the author what he said about her like Jerry Fawval saying he finally met somebody that was some cartoon character

[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:22.060]
There wasn't a fact, you know, hey listen

[01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:26.660]
I needed I caught on the show a little late. Let me answer some what about boxing I box for many years

[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:28.240]
I still train are they gay too?

[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:31.280]
Only Mike Tyson you think no

[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:37.140]
Also the boxes are okay. It's the rest of us. You got to worry about what's the comparison box your boxes are standing

[01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:42.860]
You know well, they're swinging at each other not grabbing each other and putting each other down on the ground

[01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:46.720]
And mounting and rolling around on top of each other and grabbing each other's

[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:52.800]
Privates and sniffing each other's armpits. There's a lot of hugging sometimes hugging and squeezing. Yeah, like I said

[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:56.220]
We'll check it out. Okay. Thank you. Okay

[01:54:56.220 --> 01:55:00.300]
Okay, here's our last call. Here's Miami. Hello. How you doing with Roger? Okay, sir

[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:07.200]
I was listening to you earlier and George was spraying some ants I believe and

[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:08.840]
My concern is

[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:16.140]
You don't spray for ants you have to bait for them. Okay, and um, it's cheaper to bait them to spray them since

[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:22.920]
There's so cheap to pay your exterminator there. Yeah, and many just go home people buy some pearl gel

[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:25.220]
Set up a couple of items and what?

[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:27.640]
T-R-O-O

[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:31.200]
Peral gel. Okay, T-R-O-O

[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.600]
Peral T-E-R-O-O

[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:35.960]
Yeah, okay

[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:38.880]
Okay, it's

[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:44.500]
Most ant-like sugar. So the only way to do that and to get rid of them

[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:48.420]
It's to bait them and get to the main source which is the colony if you're such a spray

[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:52.180]
And more you can do spray them out throughout the whole bill. Well, spray them with what we're not spraying and we're just kidding

[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:57.140]
We're just smacking slapping them. Oh, I understood. We're coming one at a time. No, we don't have anything this spray

[01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:02.260]
We haven't got squat. Oh my the only way to get rid of them is to bait them, sir

[01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:07.360]
If you don't get to the car to the main queen which enough and you got to get to the main queen

[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:08.760]
That's exactly what I always said

[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:13.220]
You have to keep baiting them okay, we'll throw out your favorite. Thanks for the good news

[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:16.940]
Okay, let's go out and get some terrible stuff and smear it around. Well, let's just bait them

[01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:21.960]
1600 open lines today the worst day in a history of my life

[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:26.680]
I feel like a death story actually almost called you this morning called in sick because they got about two and a half hour

[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:29.400]
sleep with a blood sugar about 9,000

[01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:34.240]
Because they got about you know just only 40 or 50 people trying to kill me. It's not too bad

[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.220]
Friends, be very afraid

[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:43.340]
Oh well, oh well

[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:47.000]
My sack is like a symbol and my nuts are like pearls

[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:50.540]
I don't even have enough to pack us world

[01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:53.420]
I tried secret lotion and technology

[01:56:54.180 --> 01:57:00.500]
But it's don't get no bigger than a dog see there's nothing I can do

[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:08.500]
I only got a three inch two are you sure you'll be disappointed when we reach my house

[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:12.000]
Because you won't know for sure if I'm a man or a mouse

[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:19.060]
Is ain't no big Mac or like a happy new you get more satisfaction from your high heel

[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:21.720]
You'll swear I was in the pool

[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:25.220]
Because I only got a three inch two

[01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:32.500]
Sometimes that night I wonder if it will ever grow

[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:39.220]
If I was a homosexual I couldn't even push in your soup

[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:43.900]
It looks like Mr. Peanut without the king

[01:57:43.900 --> 01:57:47.440]
It's got capillaries instead of things

[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:50.900]
The God circulation with a big ring

[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:54.660]
For Halloween I'm dressing like a buffalo wing

[01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:57.560]

I can only find a three inch two

[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:32.400]
45 and 560 WQR I think what we're learning from this show today is that you know most rake cars are either very naive

[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:37.000]

[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:55.640]

Something happened with the RAC unit and it crapped out about halfway through it

[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:38.000]
Did I just held down in the floor, but I went back up onto the first level up there

[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.920]

Maybe I'm have around some happen with the AC, but it was great

[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:13.720]
Two more days

[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:15.560]
I'll go to the middle of the road

[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:16.260]
Huh?

[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:16.780]
Go

[02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:17.760]
Two more days

[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:18.760]
You can go to the middle of the road

[02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:22.560]
Okay, how about I get all to go and then I come over and pick it up and look at the restaurant

[02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:48.040]
Okay, okay

[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:49.120]
I started that emotion

[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:51.460]
Yeah, we need a lot more Asians down here baby

[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:53.100]
We've been by the busload

[02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:56.800]
We got to ship a whole bunch of people in and a whole bunch of other people

[02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:59.540]
Not to mention no names

[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:03.640]
We have an open line in Broward 1600 and they date counties

[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:06.780]
See that's where it's actually just like the article in the heralds said there's no more Jews

[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:09.280]
It's just Hispanics. It's just

[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:13.000]
That's what the goddamn heralds said

[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.680]
It's got all these statistics disappearing Democrats

[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:16.920]
Disappearing Jews

[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:22.440]
Disappearing old condo commandos. They're old. They're dead. They ran away. It's white flight

[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:28.500]
We got Hispanics. We got Sparkers. We got both people. That's it. That's state county, baby

[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:32.960]
Here's a point and be chill out

[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:35.360]
Okay, great good one

[02:04:36.460 --> 02:04:38.120]
Here's a mobile in Jupiter. Hello

[02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:42.760]
Mobile in Jupiter. Yes, Claudio. Yes, sir

[02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:49.620]
Just wanted to know are you aware of the fact that dark side of the moon is the largest selling LP in the history of all time?

[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:50.560]
Yeah

[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:56.840]
Yeah, you made a common Friday about pink Floyd being in the top 10 rock bands. No, they're not

[02:04:57.480 --> 02:05:04.160]
Yes, they are let's see again if we're gonna go on record sales then Connie Francis and I can bring out

[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:08.740]
I could dig out my billboard book and give you a whole bunch of other people that had time Frankie Avalon

[02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:11.560]
I thought about the top selling you record of all

[02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:13.460]
So sure let me say to you again

[02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:15.740]
Let me say to you again

[02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:24.260]
You're not listening to me sir nor are you capable because people at a render pink Floyd did so much acid that they can't follow what I'm saying anyway

[02:05:25.660 --> 02:05:31.240]
Record sales doesn't make somebody great anymore than ice cream sales makes vanilla ice cream delicious

[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:36.640]
We're back to that same very old tired, but very accurate argument. Okay, sir

[02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:44.220]
Selling a whole lot of records if that's the case then the back street boys are one of the great groups in the last 30 years, okay

[02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:47.940]
And George is peeing in his pants thinking about that

[02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:56.500]
One call that this is unbelievable today all the crap we got going on here today and it's the same old tired

[02:05:56.500 --> 02:05:58.780]
Stale South Florida dead crowd

[02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:04.920]
Is there anybody alive and awake out there five six seven oh five sixty

[02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:10.620]
Five sixty on the mobile one line for crying out loud. It's unbelievable. This place

[02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:15.360]
Here's having sure our last call today. Hello. Hey, how you doing?

[02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:18.560]
The worst I'm sorry about the absolute worst

[02:06:19.160 --> 02:06:23.180]
Rag myself out of a sick bed. I schlep in here this morning to entertain the troops

[02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:27.100]
And these people have climbed up like a big gigantic dead clan

[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:33.480]
Even Joe to magio saying more now than these people are it's disgusting isn't it even Stanley Kubrick is talking up a storm

[02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:34.480]
That's proud

[02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:39.920]
I used to rest in high school and it's definitely a fact point about about it. I don't like Daniel

[02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:40.740]
Munchen

[02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:42.600]
Stunning was meant in tight

[02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:46.000]
Even even bad man and Robin

[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.020]
New phone. Okay. How do you like that side? That was good

[02:06:49.940 --> 02:06:54.140]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line

[02:06:54.980 --> 02:07:01.560]
Airread seriously when I when I write my autobiography. It's going to be called begging for calls

[02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:06.960]
That'll sum up the 20 whatever read winds up being the last number years in this town

[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:09.040]
begging for calls

[02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:10.700]
begging for response

[02:07:10.700 --> 02:07:14.940]
begging for some, by the way, we just got a faction of those three kids at the arena the other night

[02:07:14.940 --> 02:07:19.600]
That were like poking each other out all there is we find out they're on a goddamn wrestling team

[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:25.680]
So I can understand what they're a little reluctant to speak to me in public. I understand. They want to hurt your image right?

[02:07:27.380 --> 02:07:29.100]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello

[02:07:29.740 --> 02:07:30.860]
Now yes, sir

[02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:39.580]
Uh pink schloi was not the largest selling album with the longest charting album in history the guys got its facts and none of that proves anything anyway

[02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:45.500]
What what does that mean? It means it's zip right also listen Joe Demaggio passed

[02:07:46.140 --> 02:07:52.660]
Yeah, he rest of these I got a great idea for like a memorial Joe Demaggio day. Yeah, everybody in America on that day

[02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:57.880]
It's a matter of a blow up dog right but everybody in America that they doesn't sign anything right

[02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:02.460]
That's it like that's the memorial. I won't sign it unless you're paying me that's your memorial

[02:08:02.460 --> 02:08:04.020]
That's a good point. Okay excellent

[02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:08.720]
Yeah, what was the big deal with him by the way anybody got any mr. Old mr. Coffee machine hanging around

[02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:09.180]
Whoo

[02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:13.520]
Those are gonna go through the roof baby hang on to your mr. Coffee maker

[02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:20.040]
By especially if Joe signed it. Would he sign them? No five six seven oh five would he sign a baseball? No

[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:25.820]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line, but he never stole a freight train

[02:08:26.980 --> 02:08:32.280]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hill. Yes, sir. I want to know why Paul Simon wasn't on that list

[02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:35.940]
Unlisted block 10 now he's got to be one of the top 10

[02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:36.680]
Oh

[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:41.460]
Solo or even with the same garb

[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:44.860]
Most solo and with Simon and Garfun. There's a guy to sit there

[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:52.560]
The doing quality work for 30 years. No, how many number what how many hit does he had a lot a con but what does that have to do with it?

[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:58.780]
So did Connie Francis? I'm talking about a third of this who had more big hits Connie Francis or Paul Simon

[02:08:58.780 --> 02:09:01.840]
Yeah, but I'm talking about excellent x1 song

[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:06.300]
Well, that's a great yeah, talking great music here. Did you say he had a lot of hits?

[02:09:06.780 --> 02:09:13.320]
Yeah, but he did both things yeah, he sold a ton of records and he had the consistent record of excellence

[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:17.680]
You know throughout three three decades he was doing great with me until he didn't grace land

[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:21.320]
I love grace land and that's when I said oh boy poor Paul Simon

[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:26.080]
Yeah, I think maybe you need to listen to it again, but that's not what I call okay

[02:09:26.660 --> 02:09:31.460]
I normally don't read my first land again. No, no. I don't normally read

[02:09:31.980 --> 02:09:32.860]
Cal Thomas

[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:42.840]
I mean articles he is a reactionary piece of crap. Yes, and I read the one this morning. Yeah, and I love it when these holier than thou

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:50.960]
religious types. Yeah, in this in this article takes a shot at Clintons dead mother. Yeah, he said that

[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:55.980]
if it's just apparently Monica talked about his religious upbringing and he said that the only Trinity

[02:09:56.680 --> 02:09:58.580]
Inclippance father was the twy-sector

[02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:01.060]
I guess meaning that she was a gambler

[02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:07.240]
So how about this guy? I mean nice story takes a shot at Clinton because he's a religious man

[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:09.480]
Just like all the rest of them. They're all of my

[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.900]
buddies and hypocrites and hate mongers. Don't you get it? But now hate mongers

[02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:16.340]
Just I'm not talking we're not talking love

[02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:21.860]
Yeah, or forgiveness or tolerance or any of that we're talking a hateful right nasty

[02:10:22.580 --> 02:10:25.540]
Uh right wait a piece for her right absolutely and uh

[02:10:26.260 --> 02:10:27.700]
I it speaks for itself

[02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:31.120]
Take that it's a little bit correct. Okay, calm down

[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:37.260]
She don't mind. It's too long to tell our how many times has this happened to you

[02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:39.260]
I am safe

[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:41.320]

[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:44.080]
I'm not

[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:53.880]
Another evening of listening to records backwards ruined by satanic messages now protect yourself by insisting on quality recordings only from backside records

[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:58.460]
The records made to be played backwards. Guess that hits of that happening 60

[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:01.240]
The monotonous 70s

[02:11:02.700 --> 02:11:04.400]
And the point was 80

[02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:07.620]
Cheater that's a catchy tune. What's it called?

[02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:14.380]
Eighth out put the one or yeah, of course. I should have known don't let those irritating laugh from those messages

[02:11:14.380 --> 02:11:19.340]
spoil your listening anything worth hearing is worth hearing backwards on backside records

[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:23.740]
Yes, she's an effort liar. Okay, your sales manager by the way. I did not say I wouldn't I will not

[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:26.460]
Three minutes after one and five sixty-one

[02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:30.840]
I guess it's the one and two music hour because there isn't a call on the board take a look at that

[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:35.720]
The world famous neo-riders show just a couple of days ago the trends came out where she can serious and

[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:41.420]
numbers on air this big gigantic invisible audience. It's got nothing to say is there one call on the board

[02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:43.900]
If you got anything to say about anything. No, okay

[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:48.280]
five six seven oh five sixty

[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.480]
Like pound five sixty on the ATT while this one

[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:05.080]
Reflections of a life spent begging and begging and pleading and squeezing and cajoling and urging for phone calls probing

[02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:30.080]
Reaching out

[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:35.260]
You see the method here is the way ourselves the Department of Works is they ask you a question

[02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:39.640]
You say no and then they like it too much later. They'll say oh, yeah, but you said so and so

[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:45.140]
Like the meeting we had before I came on here and we discussed how many spots we would you know have for our oh no

[02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:50.720]
You've never had that meeting. I don't remember it. They just make it up as big a long. It's called the big lie here at QA

[02:12:57.500 --> 02:12:58.460]
Now very close

[02:12:59.100 --> 02:12:59.600]
You never made

[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:02.160]
Medley of their man

[02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:05.340]
When Marmalade

[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:09.840]
Did you know that it was the Marmalade and not just Marmalade?

[02:13:10.140 --> 02:13:14.580]
You know that? Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, you got around my fingers. I know this

[02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:18.200]
I know the song too that I was thought it was Marmalade

[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:24.440]
Not the Marmalade. I used to watch John Christmas. Don't come. Remember in fact, we just get the Marmalade here

[02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:28.700]
Oh

[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:33.360]
This guy's hot going to China with pink Floyd

[02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:35.060]
Pink Floyd

[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:40.400]
So push him over the wall, okay, pushes me over the edge

[02:13:42.140 --> 02:13:46.880]
Here's a D'Areal hello. I nailed it. This is moving the D'Areal. Yes, sir

[02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:51.200]
It's seriously I have storage that the truth that there is no calls

[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:54.460]
Now after you know this is the way they show works

I have to you know bust the gut and have an nervous breakdown and a few of them call

[02:13:57.900 --> 02:14:01.860]
Then we go into one of our ten in a commercial brace the all drop off and we do it all over again

[02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:05.120]
You know I want one of your advanced books begging for calls

Yeah autographs begging for calls that's gonna be the name of my autobiography

[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:14.620]
I gotta agree with you with one thing the mommy Harold the the biggest piece of Dreck

[02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:16.620]
Marvin Phil whatever

[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:20.040]
Agenda you can come up with it is the most pandering

[02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:24.080]
Paper to do to the Hispanics right and there is nothing you know

[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:26.920]
And it's a waste of time they can keep doing it from now until the end of time

[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:31.920]
And they still hate it like poison. No, I hated like poison. I'm Hispanic. I can't stand it

[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:35.740]
All right, just thought I'd go ahead and let you know about the Harold that I hate him

You notice that they're running neo-rodger spots in the ball games in these awful exhibition games now because number one

[02:15:02.020 --> 02:15:03.600]
The rate is a hell of a lot higher number two

[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:07.960]
They don't want to lose the revenue from those spots and number three they can't sell like that whatever that team is no

[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:09.140]
They can't sell it

Ordinarily I agree with a lot of the things you say and you know a lot of the music that you play

[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:42.240]
You're the one who actually introduced me to Luis Miguel

[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:46.860]
Feel the other people that you that you play and I'm a who do I had never even heard of them until you

[02:15:47.260 --> 02:15:52.660]
Decided to put them on the air, but I just I wanted to tell you that song that you played from that

[02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:56.520]
That's like number one in England or something right now. Yeah, probably

[02:15:56.920 --> 02:16:02.080]
Yeah, I'm I mean, I'm sorry Neil, but that was terrible. I love that record. I know whatever it all day

[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:05.920]
I mean could it but could it be because I mean I know you've been saying how much better

[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:09.700]
You know the lifestyle and everything is in Europe, but I really I've been

[02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:14.380]
Because it's a British group. I hate England. I hate everything about England

[02:16:14.380 --> 02:16:17.780]
And it's a British group. So why would I have anything to do with it? I don't know

[02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:23.820]
But I mean it sounded like a cross between Olivia Newton John and Stacy Latisaw. Oh my god. It did her

[02:16:23.820 --> 02:16:26.540]
Oh, I'm serious. Yeah, I love it

[02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:31.580]
Oh, I mean everybody's in touch with it. I just like it. Okay. I mean it's you know, but it's very fluid

[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:35.020]
I know but I mean you were saying about how you were

[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:36.820]
Like very very

[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:41.520]
What I mean it was it was very very

[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:46.700]
See when I played it I knew I knew that's why I played it because I knew that I would be the only one who liked it

[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:53.720]
But I mean, but I least don't give the reason that like that that are that are that your listeners music case is

[02:16:53.820 --> 02:16:58.620]
Very very vanilla because you couldn't get much more vanilla than that record. Well maybe I'm gonna start in vanilla

[02:16:59.740 --> 02:17:00.620]
It's got less car

[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:07.180]
Okay, I'm sticking. You'll be this all right. I'm even actually okay open line and broward 600 in date county

[02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:10.480]
Where's all those sticks in date county, huh? I'll have been here from a lot of sticks

[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:12.120]
I don't know what this thing is with this board

[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:18.880]
This this phone bank they should only take it to the bank. Okay, and stick it in the bank president rectum what they should do with it

[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:27.740]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line is he gonna make it till today? No chance less than none

[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:32.680]
We're gonna have to play this whole I found this laying around at the house by the way one hit wonders

[02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:40.540]
Like the Marmalade and there's some pretty a weak stuff on here to be honest with you and you can understand why so these artists never had another hit

[02:17:41.780 --> 02:17:42.800]
Like for example

[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:56.900]
Like the singing none. No, that's your just favorite by the way. That's his kind of music the singing freaking none number one in the hall of fame. Yeah

[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:00.560]
And then there's always

[02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:03.220]
Oh

[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:11.260]
The legend of Billy jack what a good bad look at you. What is it? Yovon?

[02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:14.500]

[02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:22.340]
I

[02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:24.160]

Hot chili is so hot it's guaranteed to burn the rough of your

[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:43.480]

Don't you understand they just lie up there and they just make it up as they go along because they don't care

[02:19:04.980 --> 02:19:06.520]
They do not care

[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:12.340]
Because I'm sure that the clients don't want us to keep doing the same spot over and over and over again one day

[02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:17.000]
But it's just a numbers game. Okay. Oh, yeah, they want a hundred spots. Well, let's don't get them in today. Okay

[02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:19.860]
They're buying a hundred spots. Let's give them in between noon and two

[02:19:20.900 --> 02:19:23.800]
They might not you know reach like a whole different audience in those two hours

[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:26.060]

[02:19:50.380 --> 02:19:57.360]
Steve Tyler music is great stevey, but boy men are you a gruesome bizarre looking as if I didn't already know that thing

[02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:03.660]
I mean even more gruesome than I thought here is a crawl springs hello no. Yes, sir

[02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:06.300]
You have quite a music collection there. Yeah, it's ready at your hands

[02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:10.320]

[02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:16.980]
Do I have their box set the box set? Yeah somewhere somewhere. No, I didn't know if you had I was gonna tell you it's great

[02:20:16.980 --> 02:20:20.880]
I was doing all the time. I got everything they've ever recorded. Oh

[02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:25.480]
Anybody who tells me that the beach boys. I said I want to rehash it again that they're better than erosmith

[02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:29.740]
It's got very a marginal taste. I I'm in the system in the same league

[02:20:29.740 --> 02:20:38.040]
And the beach boys in my opinion if it wasn't for the british invasion which is coming in masses and masses and masses and so many different groups would have

[02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:40.920]
been in the dead beadles at any point

[02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:46.780]
There what would have been better than the beetles how the beetles are highly overweight the beetles early music was bubbled to the

[02:20:46.780 --> 02:20:48.820]
worry it was British bubbled them was garbage

[02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:55.460]
Mm-hmm am I right? Absolutely. Yeah, and everything else happened but after them you had the animals in the day clock five

[02:20:55.460 --> 02:21:00.420]
And it just kept so much that it just overshadowed. Yeah American music. Well the animals were good. I don't know

[02:21:00.420 --> 02:21:06.540]
Yeah, but I'm just saying the British music invasion overshadowed only American because there was a lot of margaret even as Herman's German

[02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:11.760]
Yes, another way of Henry D8. Yeah, I met one hit wonder is the

[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:16.800]
The pilot of a run there. What is it? He said peanut colladas song on that one hit wonder list. No

[02:21:17.180 --> 02:21:20.900]

That's what I was talking about. No, no, no, the one in the sentinel about how they won't allow political fines in the condos

Oh, no, I didn't see that oh yeah, they're not allowing the political fines in the condos

[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:25.520]
So what they're doing is you're giving out free pothole there's in free nail files

[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:30.300]
With the political people's names on it. Oh, there you go and they love it

[02:28:30.300 --> 02:28:34.360]
You know, they don't want to know about the candidates or the issues. They don't care, but where's my pothole?

[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:38.060]
Unbelievable. How about if they how about if they put their names on conishes?

Then they'll have it forever because they're taking it home with them right that's unbelievable

[02:28:52.420 --> 02:28:54.640]
The other thing I could put their names on the pickles

[02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:56.260]
Yeah

[02:28:56.260 --> 02:28:58.800]

Anyway, the barbarian. Oh, it's horrible

[02:29:05.500 --> 02:29:12.040]
The other thing I was going to mention to the thing about wrestling. Absolutely right. I had this coach in high school that

[02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:14.960]
He was coaching the wrestling and the swim team

[02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:20.500]
And he was one of the most unemotional guys you'd ever meet in your life until he would start coaching the wrestling

[02:29:20.500 --> 02:29:23.500]
Yeah, it'd be like oh now you gotta get behind this guy

[02:29:23.500 --> 02:29:27.860]
You gotta put your arm there you gotta do this and that's when the only time you would show emotion

[02:29:27.860 --> 02:29:31.240]
You gotta get out of your mouth and not to get behind these right exactly

[02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:36.200]
I'm out of material okay pal. Obviously. I love you moon. See you on the mat

[02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:40.640]
Okay, okay, Broward's open more fun. You know, we brought him on the class in a couple of them today

[02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:41.540]
It's a bag event

[02:29:42.180 --> 02:29:47.780]
And if you want to continue or you know looking American vids yourself that all the time you were grappling with that guy sweating up a storm

[02:29:47.780 --> 02:29:52.920]
Grabbing each other's private and stiffening each other's armpits on that med that it was a real masculine thing to do

[02:30:01.020 --> 02:30:01.760]
We believe you

[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:05.680]
It marks that skinny chick the skin is chicken. I know

[02:30:06.540 --> 02:30:10.800]
Your future's bleak that heroin speak. You got to lay off the flow

[02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:16.240]
It marks that skinny chick. We want to know what's the deal

[02:30:16.940 --> 02:30:21.460]
The clothes of drab when you're in rehab your worst than alley mit bill

[02:30:21.460 --> 02:30:27.700]
13 at 560 w the qm there's jolton joda magio and the late merlin Monroe guess what they're both dead

[02:30:27.700 --> 02:30:32.280]
That's right if you've been sleeping in if you like we're hung over overnight and you just crawl out of the sack

[02:30:32.280 --> 02:30:36.240]
You're laying there and reached over and turn on your radio jolton joda magio is finally dead

[02:30:36.720 --> 02:30:41.820]
After threatening us with it after toying and playing with our emotions week after week month after month

[02:30:42.880 --> 02:30:43.500]
He's dead

[02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:46.800]
So anyway, I look at my billboard the thing here

[02:30:47.340 --> 02:30:51.880]
My top pop singles of all time and sure enough and I'm not making a case for her bad

[02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:55.840]
But I use this as an example for those people who like to play the statistics game

[02:30:55.840 --> 02:31:00.460]
Oh, they sold more records than anybody else. They had more in the top 10. It means nothing

[02:31:01.540 --> 02:31:02.800]
It's a question of taste

[02:31:04.140 --> 02:31:09.780]
Because if you're gonna go by that here right on the same pages back to back here is Connie Francis who you know

[02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:14.480]
I'll be honest with you. I'll even admit that some of her songs. I liked I mean, you know

[02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:19.400]
Not great, but look at all the hits she had my happiness who sorry now

[02:31:19.400 --> 02:31:20.760]
Lips to con your collar

[02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:26.260]
Frankie among my souvenirs mama la penga everybody somebody's fool my heart has a mind of its own

[02:31:26.260 --> 02:31:30.380]
Many tears where the boys are from the movie right here in the film the four-letter deal

[02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:32.440]
Breaking the brand new heart together

[02:31:33.040 --> 02:31:38.700]
When the boy new arms is a effect. Don't break the heart that loves you second and vacation on and on page in the half

[02:31:38.700 --> 02:31:39.760]
She's got in here hits

[02:31:40.360 --> 02:31:43.560]
Connie fricking Francis does that make her a top 10 artist about no

[02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:48.580]
No, I guess who's on the next page that's got a page in a half is your re through Franklin

[02:31:48.580 --> 02:31:54.440]
Which I like you re through Franklin is she one of the top 10 recording artists of all time. No, not close good

[02:31:55.880 --> 02:32:03.620]
I mean she's got uh chain of fools and respect and the think and think and I say a little prayer etc

[02:32:03.620 --> 02:32:07.120]
On and on and on all of these things

[02:32:08.180 --> 02:32:12.280]
So you people are want to play the statistics game to try to back up your bad taste

[02:32:12.280 --> 02:32:13.740]
I mean be my guess

[02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:19.380]
It's a matter of being it's like I said before three or vanilla

[02:32:21.480 --> 02:32:25.660]
Do you super fight the chunk or water pecan? No is it a contest?

[02:32:26.440 --> 02:32:27.740]
Not even close

[02:32:30.740 --> 02:32:33.760]
I guarantee you like that record you'll never admit it now

[02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:38.720]
You know I'm serious nobody could be have taste that bad

[02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:44.660]
But that isn't a lot speaking. No, it's not sure. It is you're crazy. That's not even the inspect in it

[02:32:47.320 --> 02:32:47.720]

[02:33:56.060 --> 02:34:00.720]
You guys know what I think I'd everybody over there's over the age of 100. I should know what I every time I go in there

[02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:05.380]

[02:34:05.380 --> 02:34:08.200]
Go ahead. Yeah, I used to look at it the same way as you these guys

[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:14.780]
Rolling around with each other on the mat. Right and what I used to look at is these these matches as they calm

[02:34:14.780 --> 02:34:20.340]
That you used to laugh the while I go, you know the reason these guys have been have been rolling around so long

[02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:25.800]
Atticit the reason I could think they're as reason why you work exactly and let me just have one more thing

[02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:30.500]
These these are mounting each other exactly. I see two guys one down on his knees

[02:34:31.020 --> 02:34:35.280]
They're mounting each other. You don't have to draw me a diaphragm display to me what that is pal

[02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:42.540]
Well, it was just one more thing these other people who think that this race car stuff is a sport these people are out of their mind

[02:34:42.540 --> 02:34:45.840]
Yeah, because hanging from the left turn all day

[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:51.260]
Yeah, I'm not considered at a sport. Yeah, when they start making rites or in Zell's I'll consider it

[02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:55.760]
Okay, no have a great day here excellent boy. Don't tell Joe Castello that I'll get pissed off

No women today. I don't see one woman on the thing there. We haven't had one woman call all day long today

[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:11.640]
About anything

[02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:16.440]
Probably because most of the women out there are married to guys who used to be wrestlers in high school

[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:20.920]
And they turned out to be yeah, you know, I don't want to you fill in the blank they turned out to be

[02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:39.120]
Yeah, the girl in her bag. Who cares what they look like good-looking people rarely make good music

[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:43.340]

[02:40:42.260 --> 02:40:46.260]
Now I you know I look in the mirror and it's a it's not a pretty sight okay at the ugly thing

[02:40:46.260 --> 02:40:51.240]
I got a real big public and I got like a second stomach and which by the way I never mentioned this when I was on vacation

[02:40:51.940 --> 02:40:54.240]
Here's the greatest thing that's happened to me this year

[02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:55.020]
Oh right

[02:40:55.500 --> 02:40:57.620]
Make me feel better about myself already

[02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:01.900]
I'm on vacation to them to them and I'm standing there one morning and I'm taking a leak okay

[02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:05.700]
And they had the mirror in the bathroom was one of those that's like real long

[02:41:05.700 --> 02:41:10.320]
You don't talking about the mirror was the only thing there was long but anyway and so I'm taking a leak

[02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:15.640]
And I notice I look in the mirror and I'm kind of like for whatever reason I'm holding back all this

[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:17.180]
Flad that surrounds my

[02:41:17.180 --> 02:41:22.280]
You know what I'm saying and I talked to myself. Oh my god. I have a penis. Oh

[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:27.400]
Seriously, I mean not like a big gigantic you know penis

[02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:32.840]
Not like a real like manly thing but like amazing see when you're real fat

[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:40.920]
Do I have to tell you this when no seriously the fat has this impact on all the organs of the body and like squishes all the like you're

[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:47.340]
Liver and all that stuff and the in your kishis together and then but are also hold and they like like back

It enshrouds it it enshrouds and like exactly

[02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:57.160]
Haven't you heard it's like it's sucked in if I can use that expression under the weight of all that fat and flat

[02:41:57.160 --> 02:42:03.640]
That's hanging down in the locker room the fat guys in the locker room. Yeah, I never looked at the fat guys in locker room

[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:10.520]

[02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:13.600]
That's where every time the stomach tells him to go

[02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:18.480]
I'm so if he's okay. Well, but seriously it's on and I'm looking at him and I read and also I

[02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:24.720]
Physically reached down and push the fat back and I'm thinking to myself. Oh my god look at that

[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:25.800]

[02:42:32.180 --> 02:42:36.640]
Because the fat in you that was a good word you use enshrouds your member and

[02:42:37.580 --> 02:42:43.680]
It like just it kind of like it's like a vacuum thing back up in there to the body and you can't even find it

[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:48.140]
