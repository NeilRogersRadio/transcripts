[00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:09.220]
Sport Radio 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Rodgers Show to talk to

[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.980]
Neil called 567-0560 toll free for date and rarer or pound 560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.500]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not necessarily

[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.460]
reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisitions or the easily broadcast group.

[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.520]
Now, Neil Rodgers on Sport Radio 560 QAM tell your back.

[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.560]
I just want to say this right off the back this morning that if you're one of us,

[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.080]
one of those people who drives in this town at any time and you're still alive,

[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.360]
all I can say is it's a miracle, okay? God almighty, what is with these people?

[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.000]
Most of you right now, I would say conservatively 50% of you who are listening right now

[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.680]
should pull it over to the curb, put it in park, take the keys, throw them away somewhere,

[00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.860]
like down a sewer grade and just get out and walk. So we're in Vegas this weekend.

[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.120]
A lot, you know, something that's one of those weekends, every now and then I have a trip like this

[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.480]
that it's like it never happened, you know what I mean? It was so fast,

[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.800]
like it never happened. If I didn't look at my wallet and see how empty it was,

[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.520]
I wouldn't realize that was even there. I know I did not go see the new Venetian,

[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.460]
I would be drove by it, but I don't know what it is. But now it seems to me like two and a half

[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.360]
days in Vegas is insufficient time to gamble all your money away. I mean how much,

[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.100]
how much time do you have left over to go check out all these places? Not enough time at all.

[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.640]
So anyway, get back in town yesterday at about 625 I guess it was.

[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.600]
At Miami International Airport. How long does it take when you get back to Miami to discover

[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.420]
where you are? The behavior of the people of these people and you wonder why I talk about this

[00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:00.820]
place the way I do? Anti-social, hostile, irresponsible, psychotic, not just the drivers,

[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.520]
just people in general. Here you go, you finally get from wherever the gate is, you get to the

[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.000]
damn elevator and you go up on it moving walkway, okay, to try to find where your car is.

[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.060]
And here are these two women. I would say the one of them was like 30-ish and the other one was

[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.060]
maybe like 35. Standing in the middle of the moving walkway and a lot of them, the younger one,

[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.400]
she's got enough luggage there. She's got enough baggage. You would think she had her entire life

[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.840]
just came off that plane with this bitch, okay? And I do mean bitch.

[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.340]
And they're standing like I would say in the middle of the moving walkway. Well, you know most of the

[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.320]
time you'll see a sign and they'll say stay to the right or whatever it says. There's no sign like

[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.800]
that at my international. And by the way, nice going guys, they finally painted all the at the

[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.560]
Flamingo ended dolphin. They painted all the exits now. Exit in English. Let's hear it.

[00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:03.180]
Oh, no more salita. That's right. Exit, park, up, down, in and out, whatever. It actually says

[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.200]
that in English you have some idea how to get out of there. But anyway, so they're standing on

[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.800]
the moving walkway. We're moving along. You know at a fairly brisk clip to get there out of there

[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:18.580]
and get home sometime before midnight. She stands there. And this is not by the way, this was not

[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:24.500]
some banana boat lady. This was a real honest to God, American living and breeding bitch.

[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.960]
And finally, the other woman exceeds that we're like kind of anxious to get to help. Oh, maybe you've

[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.800]
had to get out of it. Oh, okay. Okay. I mean this thing, and this is one of those moving walkways

[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.260]
that just barely crifts along, you know, just barely moves it all. That was the start.

[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.020]
I'm going to tell you, I'm not going to make it through to that really not because that Dan

[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.260]
Vegas area, you know, that real dry, super dry air. Oh, man. Ordinarily I can handle it.

[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.700]
Usually the only thing that happens is my lips could tap and I could shock a lot when you touch

[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.280]
anything metallic out there. This time, no shocks, no bad lips, just silence. Man.

[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:11.880]
Yeah. Just unbelievable. Sun is bloody chunks, you know. You ever talking about?

[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.800]
Yeah. And my favorite is when you have one like embedded deep in your nostril and you put your

[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.060]
finger over the other nostril and you blow, you know, to get it out of there. Huh? And it gets out,

[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.440]
but you can't find it. That's the worst part because then no seriously because then it can

[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.160]
be on your cheek, on your arm, on your shirt. Definitely not like long gone. Nobody is that lucky.

[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.360]
It's around somewhere and it's probably on you and somebody's going to see it and they're going to go,

[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:48.180]
oh my god. That looks like crap, but it's not. Oh, jeez. So I got all that. I don't have it now,

[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.440]
but I just have the after effects, but you don't want to hear about that. Let me tell you about my

[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.940]
adventure driving home. I could write a short story about my drive home from the airport last night

[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.180]
about what a place this is. And I see in yesterday's Sunsendel right under front page,

[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.640]
here's a big story. Drivers are living life in a fast lane and about south Florida highway speeds

[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.460]
and all these different places on and on it goes. I guess they had a lot of pages to fill up.

[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.280]
But it talks about the growing club of drivers clocked at speeds more than 80 miles an hour. See,

[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.200]
it's the obsession with speed. Speed doesn't kill. Irresponsible. People kill other people.

[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:35.900]
So anyway, I get my car and I'm heading out there and good news. I get to the toll booth there

[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.540]
where you pay whatever you're over parking. Nobody else in line. I pay my money. I get right out.

[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.260]
Thank you very much. Now I make my turn there. Okay. And I'm going to try to weave my way over to

[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:51.720]
Is that a lesion? I guess to 836. The only problem is of course you start out. You're in the left

[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.280]
hand lane and you got to move over two lanes of traffic to get over to where you get off of the

[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.180]
lesion. But your ordinarily is plenty of time. No problem at all. You put on your blicker and you

[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.740]
work your way over. Guess what folks? I got my blicker on and I'm looking. Are you going to let me in?

[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:11.380]
No, they're not going to let me in. Six different vehicles, including some asshole and one of those

[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.940]
blue shuttle bus things won't let me in. And I get to the point where it comes to the V there

[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.640]
where and I have to pull up like on the cross lines there and sit there and wait till everybody

[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.720]
is gone till I can get over. Assholes. You're a bunch of assholes man. You're rude. You're

[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.900]
inconsiderate. You haven't got any idea how to drive. That was for starters. Now I go lesion

[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:37.420]
road. No way. It gets better. I go lesion road and I get there to where you make the turn on to

[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.940]
836. I make my right turn and there's a stop light there. Just before you get on the road to 836

[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:50.620]
on the merging lane. Now luckily the only reason I'm here today, the only reason I'm here alive today

[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.300]
is because I dropped something out of my wallet. Well I'm sitting there at a red light. I'm in the

[00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.860]
right hand lane because I'm going to zoom on by whoever's in the left hand lane. And I'm distracted

[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.180]
for a few seconds picking up off the floor in a car, whatever I drop, putting it back in my wallet.

[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:10.760]
And thank God I'm distracted because like two seconds after my lights already turned green and

[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.180]
I would already be out there in the middle of the intersection. Here comes an asshole in a red car.

[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:21.180]
Some young guy. He runs the light the other way. And I'm thinking to myself, holy crap.

[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:29.520]
Yeah. This man is elunatic. I'm not talking close. He runs the light. I'm talking after a long

[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.440]
sense. He just comes flying through there. Okay. Now it gets much better.

[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:43.420]
I get on the 836. I'm going west to the Palmetto so I can go up north. I get almost to where 836

[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:49.200]
joins the Palmetto north. I would say maybe a half a mile away. And there's a guy. I'm in the

[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.960]
middle lane. There's a guy in the right hand lane who's going maybe a little bit under the speed.

[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.340]
Limiter maybe about 55. I don't know. He's not zooming along but he's not going real real slow.

[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:04.640]
And now up behind him comes an asshole in a black car. In a black boxy car comes this carful

[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:11.260]
of banana boat people. And his guy is like, well, he's he's got no place else to go but on the right.

[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.240]
Of course, there's no lane on the right of this guy. There's only a shoulder.

[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.980]
So he calls ass. He accelerates and I'm thinking, where is this man going? There's no lane there.

[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.700]
Is there a lane there? No. Don't confuse him with the fact.

[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:32.600]
He's going to pass this guy on the shoulder. Well, guess what? Just as he gets next to the guy,

[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.300]
the shoulder narrows because there's an abutment there. And all of a sudden now he comes slamming

[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.040]
into this poor bastard who's in the right hand lane. The guy in the, he hits, puts on the brakes.

[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.380]
This guy goes flying out in front of him because he's so good on the guy that's in fast. And now he

[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:50.380]
goes into the lane to the left of there which luckily for him there's nobody in that lane. And then

[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.340]
zooms back into the right hand lane. They both slam out of brakes and they stop.

[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.060]
And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, change his quake. Am I going to get home alive?

[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.000]
And as I'm looking at my rearview mirror and this is only happening, keep in mind just a matter

[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.300]
of yards in front of me. My life is flashing before my eyes because I'm envisioning this guy,

[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:22.260]
you know, just making contact with a half a dozen cars from behind and God only knows we're all

[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.460]
splattering all over the highway. Only a miracle letty gets back in their right hand lane and stops.

[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.780]
So I look at my rearview mirror and his guy gets out and what's the first thing he's doing?

[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:38.440]
He's surveying the damage to his car. He's not checking to see if the other poor bastards

[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.900]
and the other cars still alive. He's just surveying the damage to his car. This banana boat asshole.

[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.600]
I'm serious man. You people in law enforcement down here with your speed traps. You can worry

[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.180]
all you want. And I grant you that there are a lot of people going way too fast, irresponsible.

[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.020]
But it's not just speed. It's not just sitting on hiatus road with a goddamn radar gun.

[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.240]
Remember that routine a year ago? Oh yeah, they're going to condition the drivers to drive and yeah,

[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:12.060]
right. Get them off the FN road is what I say. Get them off the road now before we all get killed.

[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.980]
Then this is just a drive of like 40 minutes from the airport to my house and I could write a

[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.920]
short story about it. And none of it will be pretty.

[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.140]
From minutes after 10 at 5.60 WQAM are you...

[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.860]
What the hell is that? Wait a minute. What the hell was that?

[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.840]
Oh my god, we're already having technical malfunction at the junction.

[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.980]
Yeah, we're not going to rush today. We don't even need to miss the 14 seconds of it.

[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.480]
Get it full.

[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.900]
Let's wait at 5.30.

[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.280]
Let's just see.

[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.120]
You're number 8.

[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.220]
Starting.

[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.960]
You took your number far to south.

[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.240]
Don't think it will be hard to just remember.

[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.220]
You flush.

[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.520]
Okay, that's for my late uncle Ray.

[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.980]
Remember I told the stories about my father's brother Ray?

[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.560]
He used to visit a nearer-to-well used to come about once every five or ten years and show up.

[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.320]
And I guess looking for money.

[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.860]
I would see him to be sure.

[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.760]
And every time he used the toilet he would like not flush it.

[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.820]
Maybe he just wasn't used to flush toilets, you know.

[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.760]
For the classy family.

[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.600]
10, 17 at 5.50 WQAM.

[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.660]
Here's our letter to the editor of the year by the way.

[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.720]
This is... I want you to listen to this very carefully.

[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.640]
This is in the herald.

[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.040]
It says the blue blazer.

[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.880]
I used to go to World Wrestling Federation events at the Miami Arena.

[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.720]
And I remember Owen Hart as the blue blazer with the blue mask and tights.

[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.020]
But now he's no longer the blue blazer.

[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:42.860]
He's Owen Hart.

[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.880]
He was recently killed when he fell 70 feet into WWF event.

[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:51.100]
His last off-floor appearance was February 13th at the National Car Rental Center.

[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.700]
So Paul Bacon and Helen Dale.

[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:54.700]
Now that's the letter.

[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.120]
Listen again to that second letter.

[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.860]
But now he's no longer the blue blazer.

[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.800]
He's Owen Hart.

[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.080]
He was recently killed when he fell 70 feet into WWF.

[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.700]
His last off-floor appearance was...

[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.800]
What does that mean?

[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.560]
Can somebody tell me what that means?

[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:15.540]
Huh?

[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.320]
Yeah, and...

[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.740]
What does that tell you about people who go watch professional wrestling?

[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.440]
This Paul Bacon and Helen Dale?

[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.200]
He's an asshole.

[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.380]
Evidently, I mean, what kind of a letter is that?

[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.960]
And like he's still alive but he was recently killed.

[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:32.940]
What does that mean?

[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.420]
He's no longer the blue blazer.

[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:37.740]
He's no longer Owen Hart.

[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.260]
He's dead as what he is.

[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.280]
He's a body and a box.

[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.180]
Jesus Christ.

[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.520]
Okay, where do I start?

[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.600]
I don't want to get the sports holes upset on this radio station anymore but I will anyway.

[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.280]
Wait, let me lock the door.

[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:58.080]
Yeah, you better lock the door because if they see the Abercrombie and Fitch Summer issue quarterly catalog,

[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.280]
they're going to be in their pants.

[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.100]
Remember what I've always told you about football?

[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.760]
How many times have I told you in the 15 or 16 months that I've been on a station

[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.660]
if I told you in football?

[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.360]
It's a gay club you moron.

[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:11.960]
I told you that.

[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.560]
And of course they resisted.

[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.260]
Oh yeah, that's bagging everything to him.

[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:15.660]
Yeah, right.

[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.180]
I don't know what I'm talking about.

[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.820]
Here's the Abercrombie and Fitch directly from the store in T.S.

[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.760]
Palace in Las Vegas.

[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.660]
It's called Summer Dreams.

[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.460]
And I can see why, by the way.

[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.000]
Well, you know Calvin Klein and Abercrombie and Fitch,

[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.060]
they're used to a lot of beef kick, a lot of young, hung, hot, you know, male, female, and different when between.

[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.120]
Irrotic stuff in older ads.

[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.640]
So anyway, here's a very hot young stud on the cover of A&F Quarterly and you open up the first page

[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.880]
and it looks like you're seeing double because it's identical twins.

[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:54.340]
And on this first inside page, the one of them is like kind of like Tarzan hanging from a rope.

[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.240]
You don't have to show me again.

[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.420]
Well, you can see it again.

[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.680]
And his tattered Abercrombie and jeans are like way down, like almost at the bottom of his ass.

[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.500]
Okay, his, where the hell is it?

[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.940]
Oh, excuse me, his back dome is showing.

[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:13.560]
And you read the thing on the front-end side page about who these identical twins are.

[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.520]
And what can I say?

[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:20.500]
It says, Doug and Jeff Poppowitz always seemed to end up together.

[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.520]
The first 18 years are explainable since their brothers, but the last few aren't.

[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.540]
Seven months ago, Jeff was living in Florida playing football for the University of Miami.

[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:31.920]
Oh, my God.

[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:38.320]
And Doug was in the Chalbee desert in Northern Kenya looking for the middle of the fiction book that I'm writing.

[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.840]
He says, then in the beginning of the end, as Doug tells that I was sitting there with some nomadic camelherders one day,

[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.940]
dying by the inch when he suddenly said, well, I've got to go.

[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.300]
Where then he, he asked looking around Miami.

[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.800]
It was the middle of August.

[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.840]
He had only three weeks to make the hurricane's opening game.

[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.280]
As Jeff tells it, he pulled in the day before kickoff.

[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.320]
He hasn't left yet.

[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.480]
He pulled in and he hasn't left yet.

[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.840]
Seven months later, Jeff has tackled 87 fullbacks.

[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.600]
Doug's book is almost done and they've managed to find a way into our book proving the path it leads here can be a strange one.

[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.940]
So to make a long story short, here are these two young guys identical twins.

[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:15.300]
And one of them whose name is Jeff Popovich plays for the Heracunes.

[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:23.180]
And Paige, after Paige in the first section of this Evercrombian Fitzcatalong, there are pictures here with football players.

[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.080]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.740]
With their record hanging out.

[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.820]
What kind of a, what is that?

[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.340]
What is that?

[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.060]
That's a gate club you moron.

[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:42.260]
My favorite though is the one, and of course, see that the one cop out, he can always say, well, that's not me with a picture with the ass hanging out because their identical twins.

[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.920]
You really can't tell which one is which.

[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.120]
Yes, the other guy.

[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.060]
Yes, the other guy.

[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.040]
That's right.

[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.020]
It's the other one.

[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.440]
Well, why was the camel jockey?

[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.000]
That's the one with the ass hanging out.

[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.040]
I'm a macho football player by the name of Jeff Popovich.

[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.460]
As in which pop, pop, which, whichever one you like.

[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.400]
My favorite picture though is the one where he's holding his shorts like a real forward there.

[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.100]
And the rainwater is like pouring into a, well, you can just use your imagination.

[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:07.880]
Yeah.

[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.960]
Evercrombian Fitzsumera dreams catalog.

[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:12.520]
There you go.

[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.340]
You want to see a real macho football player?

[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.040]
There you go.

[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.240]
Speaking of real macho, by the way, now I want to get hooked on this one subject here.

[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.580]
They've never, unless I will anyway.

[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.840]
Being an old fag like yours truly.

[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.560]
So get on a plane in Miami on Friday.

[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:32.740]
And naturally, the first thing I do once you go toward the gate is I stop at the little news stand, pick up every tabloid.

[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.880]
Because it's great reading.

[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]
It's hysterically funny.

[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.700]
And it kills a lot of time on the plane.

[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.200]
Well, here's this week's the June 8th issue of the globe.

[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.260]
And in the upper left hand corner, it's got a very familiar face there.

[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.780]
I don't want to say it's Ricky, Ricky Tickie again, living La Pingaloka.

[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.260]
It says, the hottest question is showbiz is Ricky Martin Gay.

[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.120]
Which kind of prodded my interest somewhat.

[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.360]
And you open up and here's a full color spread, no less.

[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:05.860]
He's spreading it.

[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:12.220]
The untold story behind Superstar Stens Station, Ricky Martin Gay Riddell.

[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.140]
Plus his anguisher repel who died of AIDS.

[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.380]
Plus his painful breakup with family he loved.

[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.520]
And like I said before, it really doesn't make any difference.

[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.460]
Because no matter what he is, he still can't sing his weight of a paper sack.

[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.820]
The young ladies are swooning all over him and he's making loads of money.

[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.480]
Regardless, so it really should make any difference.

[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.320]
Except for all this fake crap that they're putting out in front of the public.

[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.120]
Ricky's mysterious private life has fueled questions over whether he is gay.

[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.240]
Rumors in the radio business are rampant about Ricky being gay.

[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.880]
Says this Jackie Kevin Cross of WILD 95.5 FN and West Palm Beach,

[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.900]
who has told his listeners that Ricky goes the way of the gay.

[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.840]
What does that mean? What is the way of the gay?

[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.340]
Your way. Oh.

[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.580]
But I thought that was Frankie Song, my way.

[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.400]
And the sexy singer made no secret that he was shattered when his friend openly gay

[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.080]
Brazilian rock star were not the Russo 36 died of AIDS in 1996.

[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.580]
The hips swiveling 24-year-old Hanck who's hit single La Penga Loca

[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.560]
is ruling the top spot in the music charts.

[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.380]
Showed up at the Grammy Awards with beautiful Mexican TV star Rebecca De Alba on his arm-left

[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:28.560]
February, but the white hot buzz in music business is over whether Rebecca is only a beard for the Mimey resident

[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.820]
and he really prefers the friendship of males sources say.

[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:40.400]
Ricky only adds to the gay debate by sometimes frequenting Manhattan's largely homosexual Chelsea district

[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.600]
when he's in the big apple.

[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:47.560]
Although straights new go there, Chelsea's a prime spot for pickups and all the gays pose and posture

[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.600]
as they strut along in the latest hip fashion.

[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.820]
I've seen him in the big cup, a coffee house on eighth and twenty-first.

[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.960]
He tries to go on notice with dark shades on but everyone knows who he is.

[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.840]
It says he'll sit in one of the big company chairs with a latte just scanning the crowd,

[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.540]
checking who else is there and looking up whenever somebody new comes in the door.

[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.220]
I've seen him at least one other guy and I've seen him in a pack.

[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.920]
Maybe he's one of the rat pack or maybe he just like one of the fudge pack.

[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:16.560]
Okay!

[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.660]
Yeah, you thought you were going to beat me to that huh?

[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:20.840]
No chance.

[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.800]
Oh man.

[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.840]
So you figure it out, okay you decide because quite frankly I don't care.

[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.980]
I find him just boring as hell, just denosyating and revolting in the whole charade, this whole mask away.

[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.680]
And then it goes on about his handlers.

[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.420]
Our hystericaler, psychotic.

[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.600]
That's right, it says Globiz learned that Ricky's handlers are desperate to maintain his image.

[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:47.180]
A source at one of Miami's top radio stations says Ricky's people were frantic with worry

[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.420]
that it would attract too many gays during a recent appearance at the local record shop.

[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.620]
Remember what Ricky was the last Thursday?

[00:21:53.740 --> 00:22:00.840]
When thousands and thousands and thousands of screaming hysterical young women and others showed up.

[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.580]
Poor Ricky.

[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:03.880]
Huh?

[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.300]
Just so much understood.

[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.320]
26th after time, I'm telling you my sinuses and my...

[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:14.400]
Oh, it's that dry, dry air just when a doubt drives you out.

[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:19.300]
I feel like my whole insides have like scribbled up, which makes me qualified to be back here by the way.

[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:19.600]
Ow!

[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.860]
Why are you airing shit like this?

[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.600]
I'm singing this song that I'm feeling kind of dead.

[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:39.560]
I got my smile from home with my chicken from my dad.

[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.700]
I got a party like a driving rain mad.

[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.520]
When it's cold outside, use my nips to hang your hat.

[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.380]
I can blow in your ear if you laugh, Dan.

[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.380]
But you won't notice me till I get some implants.

[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:05.660]
I need a guy who ain't got issues like feeling up a chest and finding tissues.

[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:15.760]
I say I'm cute, the same pretty, I'm not won't need your pity.

[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:24.440]
I've got a nice ass and fur like a kissy, but I can't get a man since I got no titties.

[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.180]
I've got no titties.

[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.560]
Just wonder, raw, it's something I can't afford.

[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.840]
When you lay on me, you'll spare your on a diving board.

[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.460]
When I turn 11, I started to get cute.

[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.820]
Now I'm 24 and so waiting on my boot.

[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:51.640]
I say I'm cute, the same pretty, I'm not won't need your pity.

[00:23:52.240 --> 00:24:00.440]
I've got a nice ass and fur like a kissy, but I can't get a man since I got no titties.

[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:08.460]
I've got no titties.

[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.500]
Okay, maybe somebody in the audience knows the Jeff Popovich who plays football,

[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.580]
allegedly for the University of Miami-Hercunes and they better call right away immediately if not sooner.

[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.180]
Okay, let's find out where he is.

[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.600]
567-0560, pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.000]
So, Neil, let me ask you, how about that hockey game last night?

[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:28.640]
How'd you see it?

[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.800]
Yeah, like I told you, what did I tell you after the first game?

[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.580]
I said Buffalo's going to win either in 4th or 8th or in 5th.

[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.640]
Just like I told you in the Toronto Pittsburgh series, I like the Leafs in 6th.

[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.360]
I mean, the game on Saturday was very embarrassing that I watched that whole game.

[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.800]
No, I saw the second goal early in the second period.

[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:48.040]
I bolted out of my hotel room with that point and went down and plunged my gut sound.

[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.800]
Because it was embarrassing, would be a good word for it.

[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.760]
Hey, it was a lot of fun, it was good that it lasted,

[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.640]
and now Buffalo can be forced right by their Colorado or Dallas and good luck to them.

[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.720]
Fat boy by the way, who's from Buffalo comes in here this morning to gloat.

[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:02.380]
Pff, pff, pff.

[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.080]
Pff, pff, pff.

[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.820]
Porky bastard.

[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.140]
Here's a mobile in North Miami.

[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:07.520]
Hello.

[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:08.680]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:09.240]
Okay, sure.

[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:09.640]
Welcome back.

[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.200]
I was watching the hockey game last night, and my wife had 20-odd.

[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:14.640]
So, you're back.

[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:14.980]
Yeah.

[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:16.400]
What?

[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.860]
My wife had 20-20 on, and they had the bubble.

[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.480]
My wife sees about that girl.

[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.060]
Did you see it or hear about it?

[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.640]
She fell in the pool, and she went into a coma.

[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.180]
Her mom wasn't watching her, right?

[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.040]
Well, now she's like the Lord.

[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.520]
She's making oil come out of paintings and...

[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.480]
Is it for what a Massachusetts?

[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:43.980]
I can't remember where I was watching the game, and I was just listening to it out of my other ear.

[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.360]
So, I wasn't paying attention to the whole thing.

[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:54.780]
But the father left, because he couldn't handle it, and he came back because I guess God's second name is Money.

[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:56.880]
Yeah, nobody's his first name.

[00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:01.940]
Yeah, he left, and he came back because they asked, why did you come back?

[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.280]
Oh, because of God.

[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.020]
Uh-huh.

[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:04.860]
Yeah, right.

[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:05.900]
You know?

[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.700]
And they have a...

[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:13.860]
They said that you could have the cause with oil for free, but you could buy the tape of the girl.

[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:14.540]
Yeah.

[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.320]
Or what?

[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.840]
You only 50 dollars.

[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.240]
Well, why would you do that?

[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.020]
They said that she's healing all these people.

[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:21.820]
She's in a coma.

[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:22.640]
Right.

[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.360]
Yeah, that's got to be the one of Massachusetts.

[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.880]
I don't know where it was, but I was...

[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.560]
Is that the one where they took her to the football stadium, and all those people came from miles away?

[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.220]
Yeah, that's the...

[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.880]
I mean, the...

[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.820]
I couldn't believe that.

[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:35.540]
I just...

[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.040]
Well, back to the locker room.

[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.460]
And of course, thank God that they wouldn't exploit her for funding profits.

[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.060]
Yeah, no kids.

[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:40.520]
Uh-huh.

[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:41.180]
Okay.

[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.000]
Thanks for the good news.

[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:42.560]
Okay.

[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:47.160]
And of course, that, you know, brings us back to all this newfound religion among the youth out there.

[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:47.680]
I'll write...

[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.120]
Let's hear it.

[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.180]
People want to be given a lot of horse crap.

[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.180]
Here it is right on the front page this morning in the herald from Littleton to Fort Lauderdale.

[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.540]
Teens, United in faith.

[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.420]
Oh, God!

[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.340]
Girls legacy, believe in yourself.

[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.800]
And of course, this is about the girl in Cassie Brunel.

[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.640]
And the one kid said it where the one punk says, you believe in God?

[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.800]
And then she said, yes, and he said, well, maybe you'll be with him now.

[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.060]
And of course, he's not with him.

[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.180]
He's in a box he's dead.

[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.600]
But be that as a may.

[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:21.620]
Religion experts say there's a growing movement to designate Cassie as a martyr.

[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.660]
Is this pathetic or what?

[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:25.980]
Uh-huh.

[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:26.800]
Just tragic.

[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.500]
Where was God when she was getting shot?

[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.100]
Letting her.

[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.280]
So I said, get him out.

[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.100]
Oh, that's right.

[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.080]
Oh, I never thought about that.

[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:35.980]
He works in mysterious ways.

[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.220]
She couldn't have been a martyr if he wouldn't have let her get shot and killed.

[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.340]
Very good.

[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:41.620]
Excellent reasoning.

[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:42.760]
Well, I guess that's the end of that.

[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:44.300]
Huh?

[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.460]
I mean, what is wrong with these people?

[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.800]
Oh, they're all turning to fit.

[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.020]
Jesus is Lord, a people desperate people looking for answers to God only knows what.

[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.720]
He must know because I sure as hell don't know.

[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.300]
What are they looking for the answer for?

[00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.380]
What's the problem?

[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.100]
Like we said, when they had all these shootings, what's everybody so God damn angry about?

[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.500]
Look at this on CNN again.

[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:06.040]
Here we go.

[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.520]
Little Tind Colorado again.

[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.460]
They just keep hanging on and it goes on.

[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:14.780]
Oh, and by the way, thank God there's no violence on television.

[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.420]
The same people who are on there screaming and hollering about others too much God damn violence.

[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.920]
All these same television network executives.

[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:22.800]
Guess what?

[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.980]
They got all these other, I've never seen anything like it in my life.

[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.820]
They must have 600 different shows on now.

[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:34.600]
The whole show is nothing about showing car crashes, plane wrecks, people dying violent deaths.

[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.780]
Why don't they just change the name of the networks to faces of death, A, B, and C, you know, one, two, and three.

[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.640]
That's all they got on there.

[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:53.340]
And then they said that if they're taken to the Brawlsoft jury springer, which means that the ratings are going to tank and then he'll have to put it back on again.

[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:59.500]
Because the last time that they took them all off remember that a few months ago, the ratings went right in the crapper.

[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.920]
Because that's the only reason people watched that.

[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.320]
See, we blew it when we had the chance on a whammy thing.

[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.520]
If we had just had fist fight, we could have just had a sales department meetings on there.

[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.240]
Just put a camera in the sales department.

[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.020]
People beaten us not out of each other.

[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.400]
That's what the American public wants.

[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.840]
Like I told you before, they have an unsatiable appetite for violence.

[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.480]
And I don't want to have one hand you're all screaming, oh, gee, there's just too much of this and a violent video games.

[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.080]
And the meantime, it can't get enough of it.

[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.100]
Not enough sex, too much violence.

[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.720]
That's the whole thing.

[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:37.840]
America very upset about sex, but they can't get enough violence to satiate their sick appetite for it.

[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.480]
56670560, pound 560 on a mobile one line.

[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.500]
Here's a mobile and lake worth.

[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:44.700]
Our only call left on the board.

[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.020]
Hello.

[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.100]
Hey, Neil.

[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:46.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.120]
I'd like to make a graduated home safely.

[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:48.900]
Uh-huh, I'm back.

[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.240]
And listen.

[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.240]
I'm back.

[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.600]
I'd like to be a board.

[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.100]
What you were just saying, I'd take it like George Krullins said,

[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.280]
my father, my children, my children, my two people making love and two people killing each other.

[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.080]
Yeah, well, that's not the American effin' way, man.

[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:01.940]
Yeah, I know.

[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:02.780]
America loves violence.

[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:03.820]
It's kind of sick, right?

[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.340]
It's not kind of sick.

[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.820]
Very, very, very sick.

[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:11.220]
Listen, I'm not one to sit here and talk about hockey because I don't know where it comes from.

[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.060]
Good, that's a statement.

[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:13.440]

[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.180]
Well, one second.

[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:20.240]
That game Saturday night was a very, very exciting game that Dallas, Alabama, Atlanta won a overtime.

[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:20.920]
Uh-huh.

[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.180]
I just, I was just sitting there just like in awe.

[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.600]
It was like, wow, this thing, it's just really exciting.

[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.120]
Yeah.

[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.820]
Compared to those seven foot freaks, if you know what I mean.

[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:30.200]
Yeah.

[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:32.420]
How'd you do in Vegas?

[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:32.820]
Pretty good?

[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.540]
Lost my ass.

[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:34.720]
Oh, well, you had fun.

[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.280]
I had a good time, yeah.

[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:36.220]
But you had fun.

[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.320]
Yeah, of course I did.

[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.920]
Speaking of what you were talking about.

[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.420]
I think I was here.

[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.660]
I remember the only thing I had left over from Vegas is this sinus thing.

[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:47.820]
Now, my cheeks feel like they're going to cave in and my nose is like all dry and cake would snot.

[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.260]
But other than that, I feel great.

[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.960]
I know the same thing happened to me on the day.

[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.660]
No, I hate that.

[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.680]
I don't know how to tell the story about the booger being somewhere.

[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.040]
It happens to me all the time.

[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:55.280]
Yeah.

[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:58.600]
It's usually on stuck on my face and the person that goes, ew.

[00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.540]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:30:59.640 --> 00:30:59.860]
Exactly.

[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.280]
Like when you're going in for a business department or something like that.

[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:02.620]
Yeah.

[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.500]
I, um, I slept up with a singles bar, you know.

[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:06.120]
Oh, look at that.

[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:06.880]
That's different.

[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.980]
I slept up to a single row.

[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.340]
The fact that statement you asked, oh, it's like the earring in my nose.

[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.420]
It's a fashion statement.

[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.560]
It's like the phone in my nose.

[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.060]
I slept up the Disney World.

[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:20.120]
I took the kids up there and we were standing on line to get on the monorail.

[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:24.840]
And on the other side, there's another monorail going the opposite way.

[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.100]
And all of a sudden, I didn't know where.

[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.620]
I hear all these people screaming.

[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.320]
And there's a child.

[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.560]
Happened to wander away from a concerned parent.

[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.120]
I assume.

[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.700]
And was standing right next to where the child could have fallen into the,

[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:38.600]
where it says high voltage.

[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.160]
Uh-huh.

[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.480]
And I could not believe it.

[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.840]
I mean, and then the mother, you know, eventually walks over after somebody

[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.220]
grabbed the kid with this smile on her face like, oh, no.

[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.080]
And I like you.

[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.160]
And it's these parents.

[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:55.600]
And I only took my kids up there because I have to take my kids up there because they want to go to see them.

[00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:03.100]
But it's like putting a gun to my head to see the way these other parents just let their kids do whatever.

[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.340]
And it's unbelievable.

[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.720]
And the kid almost got killed.

[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:06.220]
Yeah.

[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.880]
And it was like no big deal to her.

[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:08.700]
She was smiling.

[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.020]
No, she was hoping, you know.

[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.160]
You know, I was hoping that I wouldn't be having a real quick, no problem.

[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:18.320]
And on my way out and closing, I'd like to call somebody douchebag to cool with you.

[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.320]
A wane, you're in a pulsing, sewing douchebag.

[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.460]
Okay, see, five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound, five, 60 on a mobile one line.

[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:30.280]
Is it going to be a brutal day because it's like a Tuesday, but it's a Monday after the holiday in their minds, you know what I'm saying?

[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.220]
It's going to be a brutal day.

[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.520]
So get that music ready, stand by because I'm just, wow.

[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:36.700]
I'm serious.

[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.100]
I don't really feel that bad from the chin down.

[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.900]
I feel okay, but boy up in the head, the whole sinus thing.

[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.620]
Just what did you say the stuff was you get?

[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.160]
Oh, he didn't tell you.

[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:47.640]
He told me.

[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.580]
Well, I forgot already.

[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:54.140]
No, seriously, my head is so plugged up with all that, with all that cakes, not that I can't even think straight.

[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.360]
And I really mean that.

[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.680]
I was in Vegas for Friday evening, Saturday, Sunday.

[00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.460]
We left yesterday morning.

[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.500]
So like two and a half days.

[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.880]
And I don't even know that I was there.

[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:03.980]
I don't, what is it?

[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.880]
Ocean, he said the ocean.

[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.900]
Yeah, he said stick your head in the ocean.

[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.880]
Okay, and see how long you can keep it there.

[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:12.780]
Okay, thanks, Joe.

[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.040]
And by the way, Joe looked at these pictures and the Evercrombie and Fitch and said, oh my god.

[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.360]
By the way, did anybody call in and knows Jeff Poppins, yet?

[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:18.680]
No.

[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.520]
Poppins, whatever's name is, this is supposed to be the sports station.

[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:22.480]
Huh?

[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:24.620]
I don't get it.

[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.900]
I mean, this is a U of M hurricane football player for crying out loud.

[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.360]
They probably just don't want to admit it.

[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.300]
Twenty-four-eleven at five, sixty WQAM.

[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:35.820]
The hurricane.

[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:36.760]
In bow.

[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.240]
Three drugs.

[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.960]
Tonight I have three drugs.

[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.760]
Two, two, part-off.

[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.200]
Take it.

[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.540]
Two, two, part-off.

[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.000]
Take it.

[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:51.200]
But the longest tool, the highest tool, the smaller tool of my fellow Americans, I stand before

[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:51.640]
you tonight.

[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.200]
Part-off.

[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:52.540]
Growing.

[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:53.680]
Expanding.

[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:54.100]
Part-off.

[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:54.500]
Rising.

[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.880]
I reach out my tool to all of you.

[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.920]
A rock solid.

[00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:58.300]
Part-off.

[00:33:58.860 --> 00:33:59.160]
Part-off.

[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.020]
Three drugs.

[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.800]
Tonight I have three drugs.

[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.540]
Two, two, part-off.

[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.180]
Take it.

[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:05.420]
Two, two, part-off.

[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:05.940]
Take it.

[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:10.220]
And ask that we join together in saying to the American people, take it.

[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:11.560]
Okay.

[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:12.980]
Well, I'm busy now.

[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.540]
Okay, George is in here, leafing through the Ebercrawby and Fitch catalog.

[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.540]
There's a few females in here just to make it look good, you know?

[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:23.020]
Because Ebercrawby and Fitch, just like Calvin Klein, their whole sales approach, is a very

[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.460]
homo-erotic thing, you know?

[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:29.140]
Yeah, but the girls are all clothed and the guys have like, okay, I just said, there you go.

[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:34.180]
Well, we're not going to get anybody calls who knows the Jeff Poppowicz, okay?

[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.880]
Because this is really not really a sports station.

[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.920]
It's a sports pretender wannabe station.

[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.320]
These people know nothing.

[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.340]
Here's Fort Myers.

[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:41.660]
Hello.

[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:42.780]
Hi, Neal, how you doing?

[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.260]
Okay, sir.

[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.780]
I want to let you know, I've been congested this health too, and I just got on this new stuff.

[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.660]
It seems to be helping out.

[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.160]
It's called Lev Aquin.

[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:49.940]
Have you heard of it?

[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:50.280]
No.

[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.600]
It seems to be doing pretty good.

[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:54.220]
I've been out for about a week and I'm, my head's finally clearing up.

[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.380]
I've been so congested, like, years driving me crazy.

[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:57.980]
Yeah.

[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:02.360]
The stuff seems to work pretty well, so if you get spend, if you have a few doctors, you won't ask them back.

[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.020]
Here my doctor, I'm going to go to the doctor for a little nasal congestion.

[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.380]
Jeez, I'm not that much of a pussy.

[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:06.820]
Come on.

[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:07.760]
Okay.

[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.380]
Hey, you know, that thing about more sexualness violence.

[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:10.700]
Yes.

[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.340]
I got to agree with that wholeheartedly.

[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.180]
You know, it's the craziest thing.

[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.840]
I used to work in a video store and the movie Titanic.

[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.180]
We can show real two with, you know, people dying all over the place, guy coming to suicide.

[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.260]
A real one with a beautiful young woman being naked.

[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.360]
Nope, can't show that.

[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:24.940]
It's right.

[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.060]
Very sad.

[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:26.540]
You take it easy.

[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.760]
Okay, I have a great day, pal.

[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.220]
And when I don't blow it out, what are you saying?

[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.360]
Yeah.

[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:38.780]
Oh, man, there's, there's, I'll tell you, I do like, I don't know, it's that thing about, you know, getting all that nasty stuff out of your body.

[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.820]
I do like the feeling when you have all that caked, bloody, I mean, that's gross, but it's part of human life, you know.

[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.620]
And you like blow it out.

[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.080]
It's great.

[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.340]
But you just have to be real careful where that goes.

[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.360]
There should be like a net.

[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.720]
You should have some kind of receptacle.

[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.020]
Well, how about using a hanky?

[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.000]
Oh, that's, that's too easy.

[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.020]
Only pussy to do that.

[00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:58.380]
Makes you gay.

[00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.180]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.400]
If you use a hanky, it makes you gay.

[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.720]
So let me, uh, there you go.

[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:05.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.460]
Bloody, see that?

[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:07.260]
Yeah.

[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.160]
Oh, and what?

[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.260]
It's just a little bit of blood for crying out loud.

[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.180]
Where you some kind of a pussy that's going to pass out.

[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.380]
Yeah, but it's not blood.

[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:14.040]
Yeah.

[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.600]
Well, that, with this extra driving, that's what you get.

[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.880]
So Joe, Joe passes out of this side of blood.

[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:20.320]
There you go.

[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:22.020]
What's that?

[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.280]
That's nothing.

[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.120]
You should see the amount of blood that's come out of my nose the last two days.

[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.460]
And it chunks, you know, it's the blood.

[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.100]
It's the mucus blood mixed.

[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:29.500]
Right.

[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.700]
Oh, that's delicious.

[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.660]
That's a nice, tasty cup.

[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.080]
That's great at lunchtime.

[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.940]
Kind of like to cleanse your palate, you know, so that anything on top of that tastes really good.

[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.600]
Stop being so full of crap.

[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.000]
Okay.

[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.160]
This Joe Costello, you know what he's doing that red nut crap.

[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:46.540]
Okay.

[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.300]
They kick your ass out of Italy in five minutes.

[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:54.100]
And don't give me the see for our ease for our ease isn't for red next for our ease is with people got a lot of money.

[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.900]
So don't tell me about the tag ins like red next, a tag ins hate red next.

[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.380]
Can't stand red next, especially Jeff Gordon.

[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.140]
They hate like poison talk about a guy that's really boring.

[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.200]
In fact, you know something.

[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.280]
I don't know where those rumors started about him about Jeff Gordon's effect because we don't need him.

[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:10.580]
Okay.

[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.540]
He's too boring.

[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.440]
We got other people to like speculate about like Ricky Martin.

[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.700]
Okay, Lisi looks good.

[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.480]
He made me full of crap and he can't sing with the crap, but Lisi looks good.

[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.020]
But Jeff Gordon, he don't look good.

[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:23.700]
He's got no personality.

[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.840]
He's my member of the God Squad.

[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:27.700]
Yeah, that's your crowd.

[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:28.780]
Boring red next.

[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.880]
Here's for Lauderdale, huh?

[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:32.580]
Hi, Neil.

[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.080]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.040]
Yeah, I want to talk about that.

[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:34.880]
Can't see the martyr.

[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:35.500]
Yeah.

[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.620]
Yes, they're going to pay for it.

[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:37.740]
They talk to one of the girls from college.

[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:38.460]
Yeah.

[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:39.680]
She blames Satan.

[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.260]
What's that God sets the limits?

[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.540]
I guess you can only kill 13 and you can't do it anyway.

[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.080]
Oh, is that it?

[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:44.640]
Godhead limit.

[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.460]
Well, 13 is a lucky number, you know.

[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:47.400]
You're whipping on our own stand.

[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.560]
Like God knows the future.

[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.800]
So why do you make Satan anyway?

[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.940]
You put it in the East-Beliegan God.

[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.860]
I've been asking people that forever and ever.

[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.320]
I'm like, well, you know, he works in mysterious ways.

[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.000]
How come God is so impudent?

[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.140]
The same God that when he gets pissed off, he can like flood the whole world and kill everybody.

[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.640]
That same God, he won't get rid of Satan because he's a sadist.

[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.100]
Yeah, but I heard about it.

[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:05.920]
He's a sadist.

[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.800]
Yeah, but I got this from Carl Sagan in one of his books.

[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.240]
He said if God knows the future, he's responsible for it.

[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.440]
That's exactly correct.

[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.600]
You can't have any free will.

[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.540]
You have to do this.

[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.120]
All right.

[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:14.660]
All right.

[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.000]
Thanks a lot.

[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.920]
How about Adam and Eve would he have with the apple on a tree, huh?

[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:18.280]
That's right.

[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.240]
He knew what they were going to do.

[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.480]
He knew I was going to be a pair on the ground pretty soon.

[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.140]
Of course, that's right.

[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:22.820]
Especially when they were naked.

[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:23.320]
That's right.

[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.660]
Before God made Satan, he knew Adam and Eve would be apple and Hitler would kill all the Jews.

[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.060]
Right.

[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.040]
Okay.

[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:28.960]
Well, thanks a lot, Neil.

[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.920]
And don't forget about Greg Reed managing the station.

[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:34.800]
5670560, 0560, 0560.

[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.840]
Well, which is the most evil of the ones above that he mentioned, okay?

[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.540]
5670560, 0560, 0560 on the mobile one line.

[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.900]
We're not going to find out about Jeff Poppil, which nobody here knows from.

[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.400]
Maybe a lot of calls off the air.

[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:45.860]
Saying what?

[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.160]
Saying blah, blah, blah, blah, nander, nander, nander.

[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:48.440]
I don't know.

[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:48.860]
I don't speak like that.

[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.000]
He's number 30, 80.

[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.580]
You know, I don't speak football.

[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:52.940]
Yeah.

[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.400]
So how come he's like butt naked and abacrabby and fit?

[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.600]
Is that a football thing?

[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.720]
I mean, I didn't believe me.

[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.380]
I'm not complaining.

[00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:59.800]
He's a good looking guy.

[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.460]
And so is his identical twin brother.

[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.840]
I mean, real real.

[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.860]
On a scale of 10, I give him both about a two million.

[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.200]
Great looking guys.

[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.300]
But I find that a little bit bizarre.

[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:13.240]
And I think that the people that you have in Huracans would be amazed, astonished.

[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.980]
Might actually get some people out there to see those games, by the way.

[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:18.900]
Here's a mobile and four-letter.

[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:19.360]
Hello.

[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.480]
Hey, Dale.

[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:20.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:21.980]
How you doing today?

[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:22.460]
Okay.

[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.260]
Hey, what happened to Poppil?

[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.400]
What do you mean what happened to him?

[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.560]
What's he doing running around naked?

[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.400]
Do you know who he is?

[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.180]
Yeah.

[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:32.140]
Does he have a buddy here?

[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.840]
He plays special teams for the game.

[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:34.260]
Right.

[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:37.620]
He's got an identical twin brother Doug.

[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:38.980]
Okay.

[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.600]
And there are models in the Abercrabby and Fitch catalog.

[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.320]
Oh, uh-oh.

[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.700]
With their butts hanging out, yeah.

[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:45.880]
Yeah.

[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.060]
Uh-uh.

[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:47.940]
Yeah, huh?

[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:48.980]
Oh my god.

[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.140]
I have it in my hand right now and then you catalog too.

[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:52.440]
Next, I'll be Jeff Gordon.

[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.400]
Then it could be.

[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:53.980]
Uh-uh.

[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.460]
Okay, give him a big kiss for me, pal.

[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.280]
There's a guy that knows Jeff Poppil, who said, oh boy.

[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.660]
That's what I said when I saw the picture.

[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:06.580]
5667-0560, pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.720]
It's going to be a long, long, grueling Tuesday.

[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:10.640]
Oh god.

[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.720]
This is the price you pay for a three day holiday weekend for going to Vegas

[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.260]
and seeing all those beautiful white people in the MGM Grand.

[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.840]
I always found Georgia at this morning.

[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.300]
You know, one thing about the MGM Grand.

[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.720]
It's like, this is where upper middle class,

[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.120]
young America meets and plunges their brains out.

[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.920]
In fact, at first night I walk in the door there at the MGM Grand

[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.780]
about midnight and I just started in the lobby.

[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.940]
Hey Neil, here's a bunch of young guys from Miami.

[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.240]
And one of them says, oh yeah, you know, my tween is my uncle.

[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.480]
I said, great, good guy.

[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:40.340]
See ya, good luck.

[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.640]
Well, I mean, what was I going to do?

[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.900]
Is I going to stop and smooth with these guys I had money to lose?

[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.440]
I don't know, you don't have time in Vegas to stop and smooth and cruise.

[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.920]
You got to lose that money, man.

[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:51.620]
Time is of the essence.

[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.600]
Plunge it through there.

[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.820]
Just plunge your brains out.

[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.020]
Have a good cleansing experience.

[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:55.580]
And I did.

[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.220]
And I feel great about it.

[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.440]
The only place I can think of in the world where you can go and lose your ass

[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.040]
and still have a great time.

[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.640]
And at the Paris casinos coming along real good, you know,

[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.060]
they hold them one there across from Bellagio.

[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.360]
That thing is going to be ready in the fall.

[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.420]
And like I said, I didn't go to the Venetian.

[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:15.240]
I didn't have time.

[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.380]
Didn't go over to Mandelae Bay.

[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.440]
Maybe I'm not as fast as I used to be.

[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.760]
I used to be in a two or three a weekend.

[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.640]
I'd hit about a half of it up in different joints.

[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.340]
I'm not as nimble as I used to be.

[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:29.120]
You know, and by the way, don't gamble at the MGM grade.

[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.620]
It's a great place to stay, but you don't want to gamble there.

[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.520]
You'll lose your rectum.

[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:34.840]

[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:36.540]
Trapecanna.

[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:40.020]
In fact, I did read the Heber Room where they have the high priced machines.

[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.380]
I call it the rubber room.

[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.320]
Like $2.5.

[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.120]
There was one guy playing $100 machines two at a time, by the way.

[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:48.700]
$100 slots.

[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.680]
But at any rate, so there was one old fart there in the $2 machines.

[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.100]
And he was just plunge it in.

[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.840]
And so twice in the same day, I went and there and played a machine that he'd finished playing.

[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.880]
And hit $600 jackpot on both machines.

[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:02.160]
And he was ornery.

[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:02.960]
He was psychotic.

[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:04.520]
Hey, you're following me around.

[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.120]
Hit me on my...

[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.340]
I said, yeah, well, somebody's got to take it.

[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:07.620]
Yeah.

[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.260]
Cross the old fart.

[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.420]
$5.670.560.560.

[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.280]
On a mobile one line.

[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.060]
We got any living and breathing people out there today?

[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:16.420]
No.

[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.320]
No, they probably all got killed by the crazy drivers out there in a highway.

[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.220]
Let me say it again.

[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.080]
If you have to drive for a living in this town, I salute you.

[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.600]
My hat's off to you, okay?

[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.580]
Especially if you really know how to drive.

[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.500]
I have never seen anything in my life.

[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.720]
And believe me, I've been driving here for 25 years.

[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.220]
So I know about all the crappy driving.

[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.980]
But that trip from the airport yesterday.

[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:36.580]
Perfect.

[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:37.880]
I mean, there wasn't a drop of rain.

[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:38.900]
Perfect sunshine.

[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.080]
No problem at all.

[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.060]
God.

[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.920]
Like the end of the world.

[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.100]
And by the way, it's just searching for satellite signal on here.

[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.240]
So it must be raining like hell.

[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:47.600]
Oh, yeah.

[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:49.720]
Oh, geez.

[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.020]
It was beautiful and Vegas.

[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:56.160]
It was like about 95 in the day and about 60 a night.

[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.020]
Oh, man, it was clear.

[00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.320]
You know, the real and dry.

[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.660]
Oh, the real dryer.

[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.320]
You can just feel the blood drying inside your veins.

[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.680]
Here's West Palm Beach.

[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:10.960]
Hello.

[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.680]
Yeah, I knew.

[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:14.220]

[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.380]
The man that could sell ice cubes to Eskimos.

[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:19.320]
What a guy.

[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.260]
Hello.

[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:21.920]
I'm listening.

[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.340]
And you're not saying anything.

[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:23.800]
But go ahead.

[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.340]
Well, I'm about to say something.

[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.120]
This is the Butler from Palm Beach.

[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:28.620]
Oh.

[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.500]
Okay, let's go to Amami.

[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:30.840]
Hello.

[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:33.000]
I know with some crazy person.

[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:33.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.200]
Welcome back.

[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.280]
Thank you.

[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.880]
The door is on the leafs.

[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.960]
Yeah, well, I knew it was all over.

[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.500]
I'm not that we had a big year.

[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.980]
You said that after you said one.

[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.520]
You're pretty much called.

[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.380]
I had a ride on target in the Pittsburgh series.

[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.000]
I said the Leafs in 61 and 6.

[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.680]
In this series, I said if they don't win game one,

[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.020]
I think they'll lose four in a row.

[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.740]
Maybe five and it went five games.

[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.300]
You know, I mean, when you don't have any defense,

[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.060]
when you're letting guys walk around a farther than them,

[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.100]
you don't want to hit anybody, they're going to screw on you.

[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.360]
And, you know, they got beat by a better team.

[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:00.240]
That's all I can tell you.

[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.020]
Did you get back to your tube from the airport in time to see it?

[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:03.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.600]
I saw right from the opening.

[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.300]
Yeah, I got home 730 right on the dot.

[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.780]
In fact, I was screaming out the window at these crazy drivers

[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.040]
and said, look, I can't afford to get killed right now.

[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.020]
I got to go watch the Leafs lose their last game of the year.

[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:15.540]
And I did.

[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.380]
Tell me, is this might be being a little picky on tack wind?

[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.520]
But do you think it was wise to take out the pole Kujo?

[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.880]
At the end when the other team was killing a penalty,

[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.720]
they could just throw it down the ice without fear of it.

[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.800]
First of all, you've got a totally backwards serve

[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.420]
what he should have done was pulled them out as soon as they got the power play.

[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.060]
They had to face off in the Buffalo end.

[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.560]
There's two and a half minutes to go.

[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.100]
Then you got a six on four, you got a two-man advantage.

[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.920]
Then at least you got a chance to tie it up.

[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:38.800]
That's what he should have done.

[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.320]
Yeah, yeah, but there's no fear of icing from the other team.

[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.400]
They could throw it down at will.

[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.460]
So what's he going to do?

[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:48.360]
Just play with what you're talking about.

[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.520]
Of course he's got a four-mile.

[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.840]
You're trying to tie the game up, sir.

[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.260]
Yeah, he pulled them out when it wasn't even a way.

[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:53.660]
You're right.

[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:58.460]
He should have pulled them out as soon as they got the penalty on the Buffalo with two

[00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.760]
and I had two thirty-nine to go.

[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:00.820]
That's great, man.

[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.400]
Go ahead and say it.

[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:02.460]
Okay, good luck, you sir.

[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:02.980]
You'll need it.

[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:07.520]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.220]
Here's the leading implantation.

[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:09.460]
Hello.

[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:10.400]
Hi, Neil.

[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:11.040]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.320]
We just love Vegas.

[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:13.980]
I just love hearing about Vegas.

[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:14.620]
Oh, you're back.

[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:14.940]
Yeah.

[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:16.320]
Oh, gosh.

[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:23.340]
What I was going to tell you was, did you know that while you were out there, a man put $60

[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:28.620]
into the slot machine at the garage and $1.4.5 million?

[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.100]
Oh, boy.

[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:32.660]
I know.

[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.660]
I was watching CNN news last night.

[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:35.360]
Oh, boy.

[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:36.260]
I know.

[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.220]
I didn't know if you knew.

[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.840]
And they clashed at different states in the news of the day, like one line.

[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.320]
And it says Las Vegas.

[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.800]
I thought it might have been you.

[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:45.040]

[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:53.340]
You know what I was thinking all the while I was there?

[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:53.740]
What?

[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:58.380]
Isn't it ridiculous that people can have to go there to have a good time?

[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.260]
I was thinking that the whole time that I was there, out in the middle of the desert, we got to go there.

[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:07.280]
And as though they were doing something illicit, something grotesque, something unacceptable out there.

[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:10.820]
You know, this state is so in the dark ages here, it makes me want to vomit.

[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:18.040]
I'll tell you, sometimes I really would like to go there, but yet I'm like you, unless I have about $80 billion put away.

[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.800]
I don't think I could, because I really like to play Blackjack.

[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:25.820]
So I don't understand why people move there and then, oh, well, we don't gamble.

[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:27.160]
Well, then why are you going?

[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.600]
But it's true though.

[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:35.680]
I mean, look, if you want to get on a plane and go gamble, you have to go to Paradise Island, Paradise Island.

[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.480]
It costs place as much, not number one, to go there.

[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]
And the casino is such a rat hole.

[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:46.440]
And it's true. You know, Vegas is just such a fun, fun place.

[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:50.800]
Even if you don't gamble, you know, just to go there for the food and the entertainment.

[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:55.120]
And just to walk, I just love going to the hotels and walking around the hotel.

[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:58.260]
Yeah, you can just sit in the lobby and watch people for a 20 or 30-h own.

[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.680]
Exactly. It's such a great...

[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.100]
I can't go both line up and grab a few, yeah.

[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.680]
So you wouldn't move there, huh?

[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.360]
No, I wouldn't move... No, I would not move there.

[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:05.740]
Yeah.

[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.300]
Why would I move there?

[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.660]
Yeah, no reason, too, when you can go whenever you want.

[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:10.560]
It's a cowboy town.

[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:11.760]
Yeah, huh?

[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:12.840]
Okay, have a great day.

[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:13.940]
All right, you too, bye.

[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.480]
I would never...

[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.140]
I would never dream of moving there.

[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.560]
Plus that dry air.

[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.260]
Boy, about a month straight of that.

[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:25.160]
I would just be like, caked up in a big glob of dry blood.

[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.020]
That would be me.

[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.460]
So I'm serious. That's all I would be.

[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:28.480]
Oh, what's that?

[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:29.680]
Oh, it's just a blood cake.

[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:31.160]
It used to be a guy.

[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.420]
Just a big fat blob cake.

[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.820]
Man, it just dries your insides out.

[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:42.060]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on a mobile one line on a deadly Tuesday.

[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.820]
Three minutes before 11 at 5, 60, WQA.

[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:45.160]
And you want to...

[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.200]
WQA.

[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.640]
I have a big foot-water tail.

[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.320]
I have a big foot-water tail.

[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.440]
I have a big foot-water tail.

[00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:01.240]
Join the anarei to start guns today.

[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:04.120]
Have yourself some down on Christmas and fun.

[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:04.640]
Oh, what?

[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:08.080]
Well, your friends away will back you all away.

[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.160]
If any of your right people are the gun.

[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.560]
When you think of all the benefits you're getting.

[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.080]
Life will be sweeter.

[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:18.720]
When you catch your heater.

[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.540]
You carry a light and to be deadly.

[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.840]
Come on and start today.

[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:25.540]
It's the American way.

[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.440]
And the American world, the anarei.

[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.840]
A-for the beast.

[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.540]
A-for the chest.

[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.380]
And always a-for the head.

[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:35.860]
A-for laughing up.

[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.820]
Oh, sharpen your skin.

[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.980]
Feel more and touch the tail.

[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.880]
There you can spend your life to find the gun.

[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:44.760]
Come on inside today.

[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:50.160]
And you'll be proud to say you're a member of the anarei.

[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:54.800]
It's 11.02 at 5.60 WQA.

[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.480]
And so Sam, the Shamar Promotions Member,

[00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:58.360]
just in here telling me that he was a member of the...

[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.400]
Well, not this group, but he was on that same plane.

[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:02.460]
Coming back from Venezuela.

[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.600]
That's on the front page of the Herald this morning.

[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.240]
Miami officer claims abuse in Venezuela.

[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:09.680]
Travelers accused of endagering the flight.

[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.760]
And it goes on and on about 11.

[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:15.560]
Miami men who were accused of rowdy behavior on their charter flight.

[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:19.500]
And then were detained in Caracas in miserable conditions for more than 24 hours.

[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:23.580]
Well, come to fight out that Sam, who is from Venezuela, was on that plane.

[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.220]
And he said that those Cubans were assholes.

[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.380]
What he said, they were grabbing the stewardesses ass.

[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.220]
And he were acting like a bunch of assholes.

[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:31.080]
That's what he said.

[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.780]
But in the article here, it says that kept calling us the Cubans,

[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:37.240]
told us our passports were fake.

[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.680]
We were illegals, et cetera, and so on and gave them a hassle

[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:42.160]
them for hours and hours, to which we say,

[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.480]
All right, that'll teach you to go to Caracas.

[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.940]
I told you it's a 10th world country.

[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:46.900]
Didn't I tell you that?

[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:47.860]
Oh, God.

[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:49.240]
You get to the airport.

[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.380]
They're talking about a paramilitary operation.

[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:55.020]
Man, but animal place, Venezuela.

[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.600]
Sam can't help but ease from there.

[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.540]
So we don't have any choice.

[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.800]
But why would anybody in your right mind go there in the first place?

[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.800]
56670560, 0560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.040]
And the search continues.

[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.420]
Also searching for a satellite signal on the small this year.

[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:11.220]
Must be raining cats and dogs, huh?

[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:13.420]
Here's Kendall. Hello.

[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.440]
Hello, Neil.

[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.780]
Yes. How are you?

[00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:17.360]
Okay.

[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:23.100]
Neil, maybe you can confirm rumor I've heard that Phil Henry is coming back

[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:24.200]
on the morning thing.

[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:24.560]
Yeah, right.

[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.000]
Not happened.

[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.540]
Coming back on what morning thing?

[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:30.080]
Well, there's like some sort of syndication deal that they're working on.

[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:30.540]
No.

[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:31.860]
I'm working on what?

[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:35.260]
Bringing him, you know, from the KFI in Los Angeles.

[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.980]
Is national syndication?

[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:37.560]
Uh-huh.

[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.120]
How long have we been here in that?

[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.120]
About a week.

[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.920]
I've been here in it for a year and a half.

[00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:42.640]
It's not happening.

[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:43.340]
Not happening.

[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:44.600]
All right.

[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:44.820]
All right.

[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:45.740]
Listen, another sur.

[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:50.580]
I want to ask you about, I don't know if you knew this about him,

[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:55.960]
but Deb Bush, apparently a big supporter of Casino gambling.

[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:56.580]
Is that true?

[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.160]
No, he's not.

[00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:59.340]
Oh, you got some great information, man.

[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:01.300]
You got great information.

[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.720]
No, of course he's not a supporter of Casino gambling.

[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:08.480]
He won't even let him have the guy that's in the race tracks that they just killed that bill.

[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:09.980]
Where were you getting this information?

[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.100]
Are you on drugs?

[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.200]
Are you doing magic mushrooms?

[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.440]
Well, I've been rolling a little bit.

[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.000]
Okay. Well, keep rolling away, pal.

[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:16.400]
That's it.

[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:17.680]
That's the end of our calls for today.

[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:19.460]
That's the end.

[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:20.800]
Minute and four minutes today.

[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:22.840]
Well, like you said, it's a vacation log.

[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:23.820]
We're still on vacation.

[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.580]
I think we did pretty damn good by the way in the month of May,

[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.440]
considering when you really stop and think about it.

[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.600]
We actually had a few calls in the month of May.

[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.400]
Now today, oh, that's right.

[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.840]
Today is the first of June officially.

[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:35.800]
Oh, we're done.

[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:36.860]
We're history.

[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.340]
Just look at the phone.

[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.060]
You can tell right there.

[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:39.420]
We're done.

[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.520]
It's been a lot of fun.

[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:41.260]
It's been great.

[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.780]
But I forgot about what it's like.

[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:44.400]
Now it's not officially summer on the calendar.

[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:46.520]
But believe me when I tell you, we're done.

[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:47.000]
We're cooked.

[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:47.720]
We're finito.

[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.140]
So let me tell you the little story that Sam just told me.

[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:53.860]
5667-0560.

[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:55.100]
Pound 560.

[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:57.940]
First of all, it was boring.

[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.800]
And secondly, when I tell somebody I'm not going to repeat something on a year,

[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.160]
I don't repeat it on a year.

[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:07.360]
Always find it very disturbing that people say, oh, you can't say that if I tell you I'm not going to repeat it,

[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:08.320]
I don't repeat it.

[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:10.620]
Although it would have been more interesting.

[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.720]
5667, we got anybody on here at all.

[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.580]
Huh? I see one that maybe thinking about it.

[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:19.580]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:19.940]
Hello.

[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:23.280]
Mobile in Hollywood.

[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:24.620]
Neil.

[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:25.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:26.600]
Pretty desperate, huh?

[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:29.600]
You know, you know, I think it is, but the sky is falling.

[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:31.300]
I guess there's another hurricane on its way.

[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:31.760]
Uh-huh.

[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:32.940]
I want to tell you that.

[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000]
You're deaf off of it, your brother.

[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:35.180]
I guess so.

[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.220]
I want to tell you that.

[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:36.780]
I can't believe it.

[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.580]
I can't get any calls from people who that is.

[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.120]
This town is so boring.

[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.640]
I'm not just, I'm just, this town is so boring.

[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.520]
It's so freaking boring here, man.

[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.000]
These people are boring.

[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:46.900]
They are.

[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:47.560]
You know what?

[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:48.640]
It is.

[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:50.620]
I had more fun in the first five minutes in Vegas

[00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:52.020]
than I have here in 10 years.

[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.180]
Let me tell you now, I'm probably one of the only natives

[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:57.400]
from South Florida, and as soon as I can get the halada here,

[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:58.240]
any other place.

[00:52:58.520 --> 00:52:58.640]
Oh, God.

[00:52:58.740 --> 00:52:59.800]
Why couldn't I ever get the name?

[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:01.760]
Why couldn't it have been me there at the Marage,

[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.640]
you wouldn't have afforded a half million on the slot machine?

[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.980]
I would have sent you all a personal love, thank you, cards,

[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:06.800]
and have a great life.

[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.200]
The reason why I'm calling you is because I want to tell you that,

[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.560]
I'm not a sports fan.

[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.100]
I had all looked at whatever.

[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:17.380]
But I happened to watch a particular basketball game.

[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.900]
And now I know the reason why you always bash basketball

[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:22.880]
because that is boring as crap.

[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:23.820]
Oh, it's the worst.

[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.920]
I mean, how many fouls and...

[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:27.620]
All the way in the room?

[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:28.620]
Nice hairdos, though.

[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:30.040]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.740]
I mean, I just don't get it.

[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.320]
It's absolutely stupid and why anyone would want to watch that crap.

[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.220]
Hey, and by the way, speaking of basketball, even as much as I don't follow it,

[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.420]
I didn't see the end of that nix in the end of the game the other day.

[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:42.800]
All these heat people down here that all...

[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.200]
You know, it didn't make any difference to win that series

[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:45.260]
because they're not going to go anywhere.

[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.000]
How do you like that to hear Nix winning it?

[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.560]
Oh, man, I loved it.

[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:51.760]
Even though just stuff it up those phony heat fans as with a cell phone.

[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:54.000]
Those plastic heat fans with their cell phones

[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.640]
and their phony plastic attitude.

[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:59.100]
Well, I mean, my fiance likes basketball games,

[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:00.780]
and I said, go ahead and go, but...

[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:00.900]
Yeah.

[00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.260]
I would not want to go to the...

[00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:04.420]
They couldn't pay me enough to go see that crap.

[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.760]
I don't know how you could feel like that.

[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:06.180]
The freak show.

[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:09.160]
How can you milk like three minutes of a basketball game

[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.300]
for like a half an hour?

[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:10.540]
Right.

[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.100]
All those free throws.

[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.940]
Well, they only have 85 timeouts, you know,

[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:14.880]
and they save them all for the end.

[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:15.760]
Yeah, that's good.

[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.780]
They have a 30-second timeout, a 30-minute timeout.

[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:18.900]
I mean, what's the point?

[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:20.720]
I have no idea.

[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.040]
Anyway, I love you, baby.

[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:22.820]
And have a great day.

[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:23.360]
See you.

[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:25.720]
Okay, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:26.700]
I don't know.

[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.200]
I got a little bit, I think, that...

[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:28.620]
that...

[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.860]
that... change, you know?

[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.420]
Never bomb is me any other time.

[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.480]
Go to Europe and I come back.

[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.820]
I go to Vegas and come back.

[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.980]
But this time, I'm feeling the change.

[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.640]
In my hands, I'm not even in my pockets.

[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.400]
But I'm feeling the change.

[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.200]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.860]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.440]
I mean, the story about the none and the girl with the HIV pod.

[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.240]
I'm not even going to waste my time with that today.

[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.160]
I'm not going any great day material today.

[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:53.780]
Why waste my time?

[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.760]
Tuesday after a holiday weekend, these slackards out there.

[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:59.760]
They're too busy trying to kill each other in a highway here to talk to me.

[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:01.960]
That's what you're busy doing.

[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.420]
Get out of your cars now.

[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:04.480]
Okay, park it.

[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:05.940]
Pull it off the shoulder of the road.

[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.220]
Park the guy, damn thing.

[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:07.580]
Okay?

[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:10.100]
And walk.

[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:11.880]
Save our lives.

[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:15.960]
Save our lives from a bunch of murdering assholes and cars and trucks down here,

[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.180]
including that jacket.

[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:19.020]
You know, and I shouldn't say this.

[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.440]
Because, you know, I'm not a violent person, but...

[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.840]
I was thinking to myself, if it would have been me,

[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:29.160]
all of first of all, I wouldn't have been going that slow.

[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:31.160]
But if for some reason I would have been,

[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:34.280]
in that right-hand lane and that jackass came up from behind

[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:37.180]
and tried to pass me on a shoulder going about 70 miles an hour,

[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.280]
if it would have been me and I would have had a gun in the car,

[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:41.640]
I would have blown those brains out.

[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:43.540]
See, of course, the show you should never have gone in the car.

[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:46.780]
I'm serious.

[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:47.800]
I would have been psychotic.

[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:51.720]
Because this guy basically was like attempted murder.

[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.980]
And I actually thought for a fraction of a second,

[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:58.020]
I thought, you know, I was a little bit of a waste up the road,

[00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.380]
and I thought of pouring off to the shoulder

[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:00.720]
because I was a witness to it, you know.

[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.140]
And then I thought to myself, this is a crazy person.

[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.260]
We've heard that, you know, here in the building,

[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:07.980]
we've been talking about some people here lately,

[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:08.980]
I don't want to mention no names.

[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.260]
But this was a certifiably crazy person in that car,

[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.680]
a banana boat person, crazy.

[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:21.060]
I mean, to me, like an attempted murder, basically,

[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:22.900]
like vehicular homicide almost.

[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.660]
And of course, he wouldn't be listening to the show

[00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.480]
because I'm sure he would need an interpreter.

[00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.240]
Put him back on the goddamn rubber raft

[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.640]
and send him back where they came from.

[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.640]
Maybe they were from Caracas, I don't know.

[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:34.840]
Naniac.

[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.880]
Ten minutes after 11 at 5'50, WQA, I'm going to come back now.

[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:40.840]
I'm going to come back now.

[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.740]
I'm going to come back now.

[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:45.080]
I'm going to come back now.

[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:50.260]
All right now, everybody get around a Gandhi man here.

[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:52.460]
What kind of protest do you want?

[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.760]
Sit in, nobby, anything you want.

[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:57.200]
I'm going to come back and talk about this non-violent

[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:01.720]
to come for a right man because I'm the Gandhi man.

[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.420]
Cooked an organized boy car.

[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:07.640]
All the guys support him.

[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:08.940]
All the guys are cheating.

[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:10.880]
We've got the other team.

[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:12.240]
Put that up right here.

[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:16.260]
For those afraid of all the week, the Gandhi man.

[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:18.240]
The Gandhi man.

[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:20.160]
All the Gandhi man.

[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:22.120]
The Gandhi man.

[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:24.060]
The Gandhi man.

[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:26.580]
And for the mixes, this would love.

[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:28.520]
And this is some double-fade.

[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:33.200]
Cooked a party on just a...

[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.880]
God, let's just walk.

[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:36.500]
What a dream.

[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.360]
The easy one, the dream.

[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.300]
Cook can make his own clothes.

[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:43.740]
And after afraid of all the dreams, the Gandhi man.

[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:45.740]
The Gandhi man.

[00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:47.620]
All the Gandhi man.

[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:51.640]
All the Gandhi man.

[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.160]
All the Gandhi man.

[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:55.960]
This would love a justice of non-violent.

[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:59.420]
The Gandhi man.

[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.840]
That he left prison.

[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:04.440]
Markled into the end.

[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:09.140]
All the other religious perquations.

[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:13.880]
But a very few Caucasians.

[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.240]
Cooked in the realty of these things.

[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.820]
Cooked in the realty.

[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:21.640]
Take a punch.

[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.480]
Cooked in the fake punch.

[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.800]
Cooked in the past without the ginseng or the black restore.

[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:28.900]
And launched the Gandhi man.

[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:30.900]
The Gandhi man.

[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.780]
All the Gandhi man.

[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.800]
All the Gandhi man.

[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:36.700]
The Gandhi man.

[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:39.240]
And for the mixes, this would love.

[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:41.280]
And this is some double-fade.

[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:42.900]
Mexico's the most beautiful.

[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.620]
Yes, the Gandhi man.

[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:47.000]
And for the mixes, this would love.

[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]
And make the system not bad.

[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.460]
All the Gandhi man.

[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:54.080]
Oh, I'm the old time king of Catholic religions.

[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.340]
You would better do what I say.

[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:58.660]
All right, where?

[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:01.440]
I will starve myself today.

[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:02.980]
Or blow your brains out.

[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:04.060]
What are the other?

[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.620]
1114 at 560, Q.

[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:07.260]
I'm speaking of blowing your brains out, by the way.

[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:10.280]
You're obsessed with this abacrombian fitch catalog.

[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.180]
What have you ever seen?

[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.500]
If you're leaping through, you find these broads

[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:14.680]
with the big hooters in here.

[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.100]
Bear bear, by the way.

[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:19.440]
And of course, a lot of real macho jox in here too.

[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.000]
560, 705, 60, 05, 60 on the old AT&T wireless line.

[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.120]
We got hanged from New York, covered in the bell month today.

[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.120]
Six o'clock we got talking baseball with Donnie B.

[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.480]
Those red hot marlins.

[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:35.480]
Cardinals in the marlins pregame 630, 7 o'clock game time tonight.

[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:36.760]
Anybody going to be going to that game?

[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:37.180]
No.

[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:39.300]
Here's sunrise.

[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:39.640]
Hello.

[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:40.520]
Hi, Neil.

[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:41.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:41.540]
How are you?

[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:41.860]
Great.

[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:44.020]
I have a lot of things to talk about.

[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:45.480]
Take two or three hours.

[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:45.760]
Go ahead.

[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.560]
The first thing was about the drivers.

[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:48.640]
I have to agree with you.

[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.560]
I'm on the road a lot.

[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:50.980]
It's deplorable.

[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.480]
One thing I saw, and I hadn't to think about a cheese.

[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:55.220]
This would be something if you brought the topic up.

[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:56.980]
I was coming home from work one night.

[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.720]
I saw a little like a horn or something.

[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.420]
And it had one of those fish with the cross inside.

[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.020]
And then it had a bumper sticker that said,

[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:05.640]
PS23.

[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:07.740]
And I couldn't figure out what it was.

[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.680]
And it said, fear no evil and shadow of death and that kind of stuff.

[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.980]
I figured out what saw him 23.

[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.420]
But then up on the top of the car it had like a TV antenna.

[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.700]
And you're those flaps that are on the back

[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.200]
to trucks with the woman silhouette.

[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:20.000]
Yeah.

[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.380]
The naked woman right underneath you to antenna,

[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.340]
along with all the religious artifacts.

[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.500]
I'll put it right in.

[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.800]
So I thought that was an interesting combination.

[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.020]
The other thing is,

[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:31.440]
did you see Tom Jik is calling about the case against OG.

[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.500]
I never write in front of me.

[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:32.620]

[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.260]
About that program on HBO tonight.

[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.360]
We're going to point that out to you.

[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.340]
I got it.

[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:37.840]
Okay.

[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:39.420]
Now, radio and top volume.

[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:41.420]
If Tom really would have gone into this thing at length,

[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.080]
which he did not,

[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:45.400]
the case against OJ listing WINZ question mark,

[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.600]
he would have had to talk about the fact that Rick and Suds

[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.780]
came into work on Friday morning,

[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.460]
unaware of the stupid desperate publicity status

[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:54.980]
station that they're stationed in Pold with this OJ phonie job offer.

[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.540]
But then he would see them talking about

[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:57.600]
what I had to mention Rick and Suds

[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.720]
and since he hates to require me so much, he wouldn't have done that.

[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:01.480]
So he really doesn't write anything about that.

[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.740]
All he does is really write this article to promote the fact

[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.320]
that this horrible awful thing is on HBO tonight,

[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.560]
which I'm not going to be watching.

[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.080]
It should be interesting to find out, you know,

[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.980]
that they say it's pretty gruesome,

[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:13.980]
some of the stuff they show.

[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.160]
And they play the unequal.

[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:15.720]
Oh, that's right.

[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:16.300]
That's right.

[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:17.720]
That's why people want to watch you

[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.000]
because they show a lot of gruesome stuff,

[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:19.900]
a lot of foul language.

[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:20.920]
And the unexecutive.

[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.420]
Yeah, phone calls and I want one call.

[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:22.840]
Right.

[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.800]
But, you know, we talk about the quality of radio in South Florida.

[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.040]
Two things that happened first.

[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.720]
On the back of the same section,

[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.020]
you see this program that's coming on WSBR.

[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.580]
We do 14-year-old posting the show about wrestling.

[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:35.360]
No.

[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:39.640]
And then Saturday, I was trying to get something on the car radio

[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:40.380]
on my way to work.

[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.540]
And I happened across the show,

[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:43.620]
and it's a psychic.

[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:45.240]
And I figured, you know,

[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.180]
it's like one of these small independent stations

[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:49.020]
that's trying to fill time.

[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:51.040]
It was W-I-N-Z.

[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:51.600]
Sure.

[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.660]
Middle of the afternoon on Saturday.

[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:54.140]
Uh-huh.

[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.240]
Absolutely ridiculous.

[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.360]
50,000 lots of pure unadulterated crap.

[01:01:58.380 --> 01:01:59.180]
You'll help us all.

[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:00.640]
Okay, have a great day, sir.

[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:02.180]
I thought he said he had something to say.

[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.020]
5,6705,60,

[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.300]
pound 560 on the AT&T Rylosome.

[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:07.180]
We got our picture back,

[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.860]
and let's see, is it a pretty picture or what?

[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.860]
Let's turn on that goddamn CNBC.

[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.160]
Oh, look at that.

[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.580]
Down 140 points.

[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:14.020]
Oh!

[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.840]
You know, I'm starting to get a little tired of that crap.

[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.700]
I can tell you that right now.

[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:21.740]
I'm serious.

[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.560]
Europe goes through the roof.

[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.600]
I get up this morning.

[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.520]
All European markets are through the roof.

[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.420]
Hong Kong and Japan went up overnight.

[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:30.900]
I'm figuring, hey, the market's going to go.

[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:33.180]
The futures was up five points this morning.

[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:35.880]
138 down again.

[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.560]
Everyday, down, down, down,

[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.100]
except for those bastards that made all those millions and billions of dollars

[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.120]
with their America online,

[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:45.200]
and with their eBay,

[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.480]
and with the Intel,

[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:47.840]
and all the other crap that they got,

[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.200]
all these other phantom stocks.

[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:52.600]
Deucebag.com.

[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.140]
Yeah, except for the people that had that.

[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.800]
Everybody else were all losing our ass.

[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.940]
How's that possible?

[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.960]
Unless you had IBM, GE,

[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.860]
and the other half of it doesn't all have a stupid direct tech stock,

[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.080]
you're losing your ass.

[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.900]
All I want one time,

[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:12.680]
just give me your stock,

[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.980]
I'll buy it at $2, sell it at $200.

[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:15.580]
Huh?

[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.020]
Once!

[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.580]
I'm not greedy.

[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.060]
I don't want to hold a whole list of them.

[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.260]
I don't want to hold big portfolio.

[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.160]
Just one.

[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.160]
That's all.

[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.840]
And I'll wait a week or two for it to go up.

[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.340]
$5.670560,

[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.500]
pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:32.920]
Little Havana, hello.

[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:34.240]
Hello.

[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:34.880]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.100]
Oh, a new.

[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:36.800]
Uh-huh.

[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:37.480]
Oh my God.

[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:38.380]
Damn.

[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.260]
It's Jorge, little Havana.

[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:40.820]
See?

[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:41.400]
Hey.

[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:42.920]
Amarulio.

[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:43.680]
Oh, oh.

[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.660]
The Democratic.

[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:46.580]
Hey.

[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.480]
What do you think about this thing with Robert A. Wallace?

[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.520]
Talking about that,

[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.840]
they're characterizing the INS

[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.280]
as unfair that their employees are all that.

[01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:58.200]
Did you read it?

[01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:58.920]
No, I did not.

[01:03:59.020 --> 01:03:59.920]
What are you talking about, sir?

[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.660]
Well, it was on the Saturday.

[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:02.760]
I know you were out of town.

[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:03.120]
Uh-huh.

[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.040]
And it's RE, Robert Steinbach,

[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.400]
you know, the black guy in the hair.

[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:08.200]
I don't read that crap.

[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:08.800]
I don't read him.

[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.380]
He's an idiot.

[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:10.300]
Right, Robert.

[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.560]
This is the INS director

[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.340]
writing into the, you know,

[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.580]
the editor's page,

[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:18.260]
complaining about it.

[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:19.700]
And I'm about what?

[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.540]
About his column.

[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.600]
I mean, this is, this classic.

[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.640]
I mean, I'm sitting here, I'm looking at it,

[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:27.520]
and I'm thinking myself-

[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.740]
Yeah, I think you are looking at it, yeah.

[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:30.600]
That sounds like it's a name.

[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:31.660]
Hey, listen, Neil.

[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:32.980]
Are you staring at it?

[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:35.560]
I think you're looking one eye back into the other one, yeah?

[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:36.420]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:38.180]
Including, go more on it.

[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.780]
Okay, I think that's called Cock-Eight,

[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.540]
is what they call it.

[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.280]
5-6-7-0-5-60,

[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.920]
POM-5-60, on the AT&T-Y-L-S-LIME.

[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.880]
We got one call on the board.

[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:46.360]
It's deadly.

[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.360]
You know, I'm trying to get my blood-like

[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.700]
to coagulate again or whatever,

[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:51.960]
the opposite, I guess.

[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.140]
What would you call it?

[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:53.480]
Thin-out?

[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:54.660]
Huh?

[01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.340]
I don't know the medical term.

[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.760]
Well, no, in other words,

[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.040]
it's the opposite of coagulate.

[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:03.460]
Right.

[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:04.820]
When you go to the thin air,

[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:05.980]
your blood thickens.

[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.100]
That's a mess.

[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.860]
Well, then how come I had all that six-not?

[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:11.780]
Because it affects your spine.

[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.100]
It always tries out your sinuses,

[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:13.700]
and then you-

[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:15.100]
When it dives, it dries it out.

[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:15.660]
It does.

[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:16.120]
Yeah.

[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.460]
And then you kick out extra mucus,

[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.420]
and then that dries out,

[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:20.640]
and that's where you get the really dry cake.

[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.560]
You can get both fingers in there.

[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:22.640]
Huh?

[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:23.960]
Oh, my God.

[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:25.680]
It's a double play.

[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:26.840]
It's a QA and double play.

[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.620]
I got a finger in each time.

[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.780]
Well, I was hoping to be able to pick out some nice big,

[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:30.400]
what?

[01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:32.300]
Chums for it, but I don't have any in there now.

[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:32.800]
What?

[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:33.200]
What's up?

[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.420]
Oh, come on.

[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.380]
Grow up a little bit.

[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:36.760]
What do you have?

[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:37.640]
Jesus Christ.

[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.400]
You're in here talking this morning with Tracy

[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.180]
about the swing clubs and all that crap.

[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.620]
Yeah, so what do you think he was watching, by the way?

[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.260]
5667-0560-0.560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.000]
One of these days I'm going to do a show on couples' chasers, okay?

[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.220]
Guys that chase couples around,

[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:57.980]
allegedly because they want to chase the woman,

[01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.640]
but they're usually really chasing the guy,

[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:01.160]
like 95% of the time.

[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.460]
One of these days, but not today.

[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:06.820]
Here's a mobile-infor-later nail.

[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:07.100]
Hello.

[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:08.620]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:09.200]
Pretty good, sir.

[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.980]
Listen, I was wondering if you guys can't

[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:12.860]
to talk about, uh,

[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.660]
a favorite sheriff Nick winning a million bucks out in the lake.

[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:16.320]
Yeah, that's the last one.

[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.460]
That's old news.

[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:18.400]
That was last week, yeah.

[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.260]
Uh, so I don't know if he talked about that.

[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:20.820]
I did, yeah.

[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.340]
I thought he was an anti-gambling.

[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:24.860]
He was anti-gambling as a goddamn self-righteous,

[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.460]
hypocritical piece of crap with white hair as what he is.

[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.020]
And he was out there with that other asshole Preston Henley,

[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:31.240]
combined the money and...

[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.360]
He was out there with his buddy Preston Hen.

[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:34.940]
Oh, yeah.

[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.060]
Oh, my God.

[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.460]
Like the rich kid richer man.

[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:38.480]
Oh, Jesus.

[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:39.480]
Man.

[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.840]
Well, now I'm really having a real life.

[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:41.820]
Thanks for the good news, sir.

[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:43.060]
Oh, God.

[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.340]
That Evan Preston Hen from the Swap Shop,

[01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:47.800]
where they used to have me do remotes,

[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:49.440]
only because he liked seeing me practically

[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.860]
and tears on the stage there.

[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:54.240]
From the elephant crap that sought us.

[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.300]
Oh, my God.

[01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:58.260]
Preston Henley is good buddy, Sheriff Nick.

[01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.380]
Two of them, man.

[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:00.580]
Join it the hip.

[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.800]
I think they even showered together those two.

[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.620]
Sheriff Nick and his million dollars he won in the slaughter tournament.

[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:08.480]
And yet it's illegal.

[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:09.460]
See, that's what I was saying.

[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.000]
I'm in Vegas.

[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:11.140]
And I have it a great time.

[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.660]
And I'm thinking to myself, what kind of crap is it?

[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.860]
What kind of a communist bunch of crap is it?

[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.700]
That it's okay to be here and doing this?

[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:19.500]
Out in the middle of the goddamn desert.

[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:24.440]
But God in Florida, it would be illicit and illegal and horrendous,

[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.460]
even though we got every other kind of gambling out of the sun.

[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:28.900]
And I work on a station where 90% of the people who listen

[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.260]
are compulsive, chronic gamblers that need mental help.

[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.220]
Not to mention half the staff.

[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.280]
Oh, we don't want to have gambling.

[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:37.860]
It's evil.

[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.540]
The newspapers don't like it.

[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.220]
And the governor of course, he don't like anything.

[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.160]
Because he's a full-flag card-carrying Nazi set of a bitch to governor.

[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:51.060]
5,6705,60, 05,560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.080]
So Preston and his hand were there.

[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:54.180]
What's your of Nick?

[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.140]
Maybe they pulled a handle together, huh?

[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:01.660]
Here's a mobile and candle.

[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:01.940]
Hello.

[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.480]
Hey, Neil, thank you.

[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.720]
I just got back to Vegas.

[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:05.540]

[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.220]
And you're absolutely correct, sir.

[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.660]
That is one heck of a town.

[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:10.320]
Where were you?

[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:10.800]
We just...

[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.340]
And the lay-bang.

[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:12.340]
Beautiful hotel.

[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.480]
Well, Kitty Corner right across this street from the MGM.

[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.280]
I could have walked over there, but I didn't see it.

[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.080]
I haven't been in there yet.

[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.540]
Great place, great places to eat, great phone.

[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:21.280]
Looks like a beautiful city.

[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:24.200]
I just wish the...

[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.520]
I just wish Casino could get down here.

[01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:27.720]
And I think that's going to be forever.

[01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:30.660]
Tell you something, the fact that we're never going to have casinos in this town

[01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:34.620]
is one of the great crimes against mankind in the history of the human race.

[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:37.460]
And it goes to show you what a redneck Bible thumping,

[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.440]
phony baloney state this is.

[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:43.100]
Here, here, thank you, Neil, for the advice to go back to Vegas.

[01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:47.040]
And we're making plans already for the probably next four or five months to end it again.

[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:47.600]
All right.

[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:48.280]
Thank you, sir.

[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:48.840]
I'll see you there.

[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:52.240]
Like I said, what a great place to go and see all those beautiful white people.

[01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:53.800]
Las Vegas.

[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:55.420]
What are you smiling about?

[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.940]
It's true. I didn't see any sparkes there in the MGM Grand.

[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:58.160]
What?

[01:08:58.700 --> 01:08:59.640]
It's great in Vegas.

[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:00.320]
It is.

[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:02.660]
I mean, if the Schwarzes want to go see the NBA,

[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:04.640]
that's great. They don't have an NBA team out there.

[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:08.160]
They can watch the games on the big screens in the sports book all over town.

[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.500]
There are no Schwarzes in Vegas.

[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:12.060]
Even the people that wait on you are white.

[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.660]
You know, never thought about that before.

[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.580]
We went into a Ralph Steiner there in the start-up switch by the way.

[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.160]
Don't go back there.

[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:21.760]
They used to be my favorite diner.

[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:24.280]
Every time we go to Vegas, I always stop for at least one meal.

[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:26.780]
Usually a couple of breakfasts did Ralph Steiner in the start-up.

[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:30.060]
And then they tore it up and they remodeled it about a year ago.

[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.440]
And they must have tore it up the kitchen too.

[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.740]
Because the food was crap.

[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:37.060]
Crap.

[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:42.560]
Which was shocking to me because, you know, it's like going into a restaurant where you've been there a zillion times

[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:45.840]
and it's always great and then you walk in and it turns out to be crap.

[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.620]
And I don't know about you, but when I'm in a place like Vegas,

[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:54.820]
it's got all those great restaurants and per phase and fantastic joints.

[01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:56.360]
I don't want to have crap, you know?

[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.240]
I don't even want to play.

[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:03.640]
1125 at 560 WQM.

[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.060]
Because my feeling is if I want crap, I'll go back to Miami.

[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.200]
And believe me, they never disappoint.

[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:09.400]
That bush.

[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.060]
I'm out of my house.

[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:13.800]
I can't have that.

[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:18.920]
I want all men needed for that.

[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.240]
Five thousand feet.

[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:26.820]
And I'll kill them all.

[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:29.040]
Let them.

[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.560]
Five thousand feet.

[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:33.880]
Five thousand feet.

[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:37.360]
Three thousand feet.

[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.020]
Three thousand feet.

[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:45.140]
Three thousand feet.

[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.480]
Five thousand feet.

[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:51.940]
Five hundred feet.

[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:57.320]
Five hundred feet.

[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:05.460]
Oh, can it be that it's not good enough?

[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:13.660]
Oh, can it be that it's not good enough?

[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:17.960]
Five hundred feet.

[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.180]
35, 60, WQM.

[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:21.500]
I was thinking about that too.

[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:24.480]
I was leafing through one of the Vegas papers out there this weekend.

[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.620]
I think it's the journal or two.

[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.200]
They have two terrible papers out there.

[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:29.860]
But anyway, I'm leafing through it.

[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:35.060]
And there's an article about how the Nevada legislature just passed the bill narrowly.

[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:39.720]
I think it was like 24 to 17 to allow parents to spank their children.

[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:48.160]
And I was thinking to myself, what business has the government got telling you whether or not you can spank your children?

[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:55.900]
Just like what business has the government got telling you whether you can grow a plant in a backyard and smoke it?

[01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:01.880]
And just like what business has the government got telling people if they can build a casino in Florida?

[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.300]
What kind of a fascist God then country is this?

[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:07.960]
You know when you come right down to what you know I'm talking about?

[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:08.580]
Yeah.

[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.260]
Talk about Hutzba.

[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:15.780]
A state legislature is passing a law telling you that it's okay to spank your children.

[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:20.740]
And the American public said, oh yeah, that makes sense.

[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:25.000]
You know, whatever crap they do shout, the American public says, oh yeah, that makes sense.

[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.440]
We have to have laws to protect the children, you know?

[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:36.400]
Like I said last week and I'm never going to forget as long as I live my own words from...

[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.020]
Deal, God!

[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:37.580]
That's right.

[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:43.540]
As long as I live I'll never forget my profound words about what's in your brain.

[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:47.100]
Is it a bunch of crap that somebody else stuck in here or something that you came up with yourself?

[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.240]
Thank you so much John Penis.

[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:52.300]
Here's lunch for our friends that are on sub by the way.

[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:55.220]
Yeah, I see another menu sticking in here for another God damn plug.

[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:55.880]
I see it.

[01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:57.500]
Now good stuff.

[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:05.500]
Unsubbed specialty sandwiches and smoothies and they can make any sandwich into a salad by the way so you can't have the bread.

[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.280]
Like me, I'm on the Atkins not for one.

[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.060]
Ten or eleven hours, at least.

[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:12.280]
See, I don't do the Atkins like non-stop.

[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.140]
I do it a few hours here, a few hours there.

[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:16.240]
Especially overnight while I'm sleeping.

[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.360]
I do the Atkins very well.

[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:17.840]
Stick to it.

[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:21.680]
100% never cheated on the Atkins during my sleeping hours.

[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:24.800]
Here's North Miami.

[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:25.120]
Hello.

[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.500]
Yeah, how you doing, El?

[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:26.720]
Great.

[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:33.000]
You know, you're right about these irresponsible jackasses, people who were drive cars.

[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:37.300]
No, my wife and I were driving out from the Port of House steak on Sunday night.

[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:38.180]
You were what?

[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.080]
The Port of House steak?

[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:40.600]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.600]
Yeah, that's on the Colond Avenue, 183rd Street in general.

[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:49.440]
So we were coming out as we get in the cab and this jackass, two jackass in there, were hunting the horn.

[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.360]
So this is a, so I would drive you one that pull out.

[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:53.380]
You couldn't pull out.

[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:54.780]
This guy wanted to pull in.

[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:59.180]
The other lady who looked about 100 years old wanted to pull out.

[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:02.340]
And you know, and he flustered her gone, Neil.

[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.300]
And they couldn't do anything about it.

[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:06.820]
Yeah.

[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.740]
And well, that's one thing.

[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.820]
And the very irresponsible people, these jackasses.

[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.240]
And they can't drive.

[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:19.420]
And, and, and, and, and another way they're working on it.

[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:23.100]
We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, can, can, and all that bits.

[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:24.600]
And, uh, what the hell are we?

[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:25.680]
What the hell are we?

[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.680]
What the hell are we driving down here for?

[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:29.180]
I can't understand all that.

[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:29.760]
Yeah.

[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:32.640]
So, uh, so, uh, that's my question to you, Neil.

[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:35.220]
That, that's the question?

[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.040]
Yeah. Right.

[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:37.560]
About these jackasses.

[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:39.380]
Question about jackasses.

[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:40.340]
Okay, well, let me ask you.

[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:41.040]
Much a question.

[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:41.560]
Yeah.

[01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:43.360]
Much a question.

[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:44.220]
Mm-hmm.

[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:45.100]
Much a question.

[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:46.620]
I just had a great day.

[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:58.820]
56670560.560 on the AT&T line. Now if you'll better lunch this year like I said from our good buddies that I've on subdaq. What is this? This is called the tuner. I don't know why they call it that because as soon as I said you I want. Huh?

[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:11.300]
It's not a tumor. No, not tumor. Tuner. T when you are as in tuner and mayo sandwich, but it's not tuna. It's grilled for strumming Swiss cheese, grill onions and green peppers, peppers, lettuce tomatoes and mustard.

[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:39.020]
And they put it all together here like in a big salad without the bread if you don't want the sub. Thanks a lot guys and thanks to John penis. Also anyway I'm coming up the elevator this morning with screw in our sales manager who of course you and I don't speak unless we just happen upon each other like this morning when she was coming in the same time that I was and I held the door open for her being a very polite person as I am and we got on the elevator again and she said, oh Neal, you're doing such a great job. You're just the best. Oh God.

[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:46.720]
Yes, she did. I mean, just the most unbelievable. I looked at right in the eye and I said, and don't put it. Jesus Christ.

[01:15:50.280 --> 01:16:06.380]
I said, don't you have me confused with somebody else like maybe is that possible? And then I said, hey about that Todd Dreck how about having him bring me some coffee for some of those accounts. Oh he happens to be the best sales account exactly we got. That's right. All you people in sales, by the way,

[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:17.300]
screw and says that Todd Dreck is our best account executive. Not that I want to start anything, but I'm just telling you for the record screw and that's her opinion. I guess the next two.

[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:27.720]
Roar. So Joe Castles and they're eating his country fried steak. Actually he's eating my salad. What do you mean by that?

[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:36.980]
Means it was sitting there open and he decided it looked really good and he's picking me to more than you do. Okay. He needs a bottle. Maybe it'll straighten them out. So confused.

[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:51.400]
So did we find out? Did you talk to the sports people by the way anybody? They know who this guy is for the hercones? They know they're just nuts. Yeah, they they used to know who he was until he saw his almost naked picture and ever cry me and pitch catalog and they're all running around. Oh Jesus models, you know.

[01:16:55.060 --> 01:17:07.020]
Those male models we all know about them, don't we? Yeah. And those identical twins. You know, that's a fantastic. I'm on a right to book on that. You know, I have to do some research first. People start with Jeff and the Doug.

[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:19.500]
The thing about the incestuous relationship between identical twins. And I still don't understand what all the history about cloning was all about. What's the big deal? It's still on other person.

[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:33.760]
We've had identical twins since the beginning of time. Stop confusing them with the facts. Okay. Oh my God. You'll have people looking just like each other. Yeah, like these two aren't they are identical as you can get? Huh?

[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:48.520]
All only one of them has got this pants down with me. So yeah, you can't really have the other one. Huh? Yes, it's the other one. Is that the football player? No, it's the other one. How about the one with his recto? No, that's the other one. Look at that.

[01:17:48.980 --> 01:18:01.460]
Identical, aren't they? At least from the naval up. Should have asked Rob Kaplan's twin brother about that, you know, because he said that he had a much larger penis than Rob. I'm not really sure.

[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:16.400]
5670560.560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Welcome back. Thank you. I'm back. Listen, you got me going. Let me put a few things together. Go ahead and answer. You are up. Put me back on hold.

[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:31.700]
No, I said go ahead. Okay. Put you back on hold for one. I said talk fast. I'm on a more. No, no, I said take your time. Okay. Any of it up. You're absolutely right. First you have to now and head with this with the state of Florida, but the broad picture with this country.

[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:43.040]
Like you said with them, deciding on not only gambling, but spanking when it comes to something like all Joe, this whole country was numb. Yeah, everybody wanted to talk about it. Everybody.

[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:58.280]
All I know from his crap. That's right. The priorities are all screwed up. All I know about is crap. Anyway, the repercussions are still being felt on that crap that took place between the black and the white. That's right. I'm picking up my right.

[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:03.100]
I'm a second child. I'm picking her up here at the hospital with her in a Joe to lose you. Congratulations.

[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:17.100]
Every desk at the front, you know, to get into the children's intensive care. So I will understand that I've been there for the last three days. There's a woman coming to visit one of the children or something in an ancient, but she's screaming at the bar.

[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:29.940]
You ask everybody you had everybody else go through here, but the black people you asked us to name you. There are drivers like that. You let everybody go by right when I'm walking by. He's wearing the name. He's wearing the bracelet.

[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:45.080]
There's nothing to do with that. Which is everybody just talking to China about all. I'm thinking that I'm still feeling the repercussions of it. Yeah. Thank you. God bless you, sir. Okay. How can I got the cranked up so God damn loud now? What happened to my overhead? You're getting a little cranky.

[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:55.080]
You cranked it way up. I saw you. I was the phone call. The phone calls disconnected now. And I was going to crank it down. He done it. He did it.

[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:11.920]
56670560.560. I'm in 18 and T wireless line. Yeah. For example, I heard somebody had some ass along the show last week calling. First of all, you don't know what you're talking about like most of the callers or this bubble. You know, how do you like that? They want to raise this salary.

[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:21.480]
It says right in the constitution that the president can wear a similar to God damn law. The president can't, the sitting president can't have his salary increased or decreased by the Congress.

[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:29.560]
While he's in office. So if they do raise the salary of the president to whatever they're going to raise it, which it should be at least a million dollars, it's only a Paltry 200,000.

[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:56.540]
Bubba ain't getting any of it. It has to begin after he leaves office. So the guy to call last week that was bitching about that. Number one, he doesn't know what he's talking about. And number two, it's okay for stupid, a little joke to make 10 and 15 and 20 million a year, but your school teachers and your politicians and your law enforcement people. You want to pay them like plumbers like janitors, okay? Like garbage collectors. I'm sorry. Like a sewage. What do they call them?

[01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.460]
What is the listing make good money?

[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:05.360]
Like radio board. Oh, there you go. There you go.

[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:17.680]
Like radio interns. I'll wait a hell of a day by the way. I'm going back home. I don't feel I will. 24 new to 560 WQ I am if you want great.

[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:47.660]

That's how many of the

That's how many of us

[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:17.640]
That's how many of

[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:44.860]
I know what you mean but I was in Vegas

[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:49.740]
I was in Vegas at the MGM about three months ago and I won 27 grand there

[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:50.620]

so you've got all these people going to Vegas

[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:15.320]
and like I said before all of them

[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:18.380]
you know you just accept I've told you for years it's a police state

[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:23.340]
any American public just hits back it says okay whatever you say okay

[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:27.420]
whatever you tell us that's okay

[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:29.900]
much a horse crap

[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:33.600]
here's Delray Beach all

[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:37.760]
yeah I'll talk about the Phillips recorder

[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.260]
I was going to say you can get a four hundred dollars but since you already know that

[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:44.260]
you know you can pull out you know the CD

[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:46.620]
that cost four five dollars if you have to use one

[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:49.200]
there's a way to get around that

[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:50.660]
what you do is you put it in

[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:52.540]
let it read that it's recordable

[01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:57.440]
you pull out the tray it's very easy doesn't mess with the computer anything I've had one I've been doing for the last two years

[01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:59.240]
and you just put one of the regular

[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:03.800]
recordable like data CDs in that cost like 99 cents

[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:04.940]
and it records the fine

[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:06.640]
haven't had any trouble with it at all

[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:09.280]
so I just have one that I just put in there

[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.100]
you know that read it and says that it's recordable pull out the tray

[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:14.540]
and works fine

[01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:17.740]
I don't understand how how can that happen

[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:21.900]
all it needs to do is read that it's recordable

[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.840]
once it knows it's recordable you can pull out the tray

[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.540]
I don't like the newer models of the Phillips

[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:30.740]
they have like a flat tray that you really can't pull it out but like the old ones I have the 870

[01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:33.040]
Melissa I don't have it over I just got a couple weeks ago

[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:37.200]
well there might be the 880 which is kind of the same style I mean you can see if you can

[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:41.220]
like I'm gonna eat the lip of the the tray and you can pull it out

[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:42.860]
it doesn't mess up the gears and nothing believe me

[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:46.540]
I've been doing for last two years and it's all over the internet

[01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:50.260]
it's like a big thing I mean that's why it came out with like the flat one so I don't know which one you have

[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.980]
but you just put it in you know just pull it out

[01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:58.080]
yeah you just pull it out exactly and

[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:02.220]
pull it out you pull it in get pull it out yeah

[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:04.740]

and read it and put it out put the cheap one in

[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:09.100]

[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:33.040]
what I've been saying the last three years they've been giving me a palestation it's a

[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:38.900]
good place I love it yeah I stand the tower and I do pretty decent right I'm glad you

[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:42.680]

[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:49.400]
is yes very good right excellent excellent stakes and you got a listen well win a lot all right

[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:55.240]
by a deal what island did you go with American oh I fly America west it goes direct yeah I know

[01:50:57.460 --> 01:51:01.740]
okay listen have a great time okay bring your shoehorn along it's the only airline in America

[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:07.980]
that when you get on a plane they hand you a shoehorn and you look at it and you say what's this

[01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:11.740]
for all well if the stick your back don't the seat okay because the seats are so small and

[01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:18.340]
a plane is so jammed and crowded oh speaking of people on planes by the way you know I don't

[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:22.060]
know how much people pay in coach because I fly first class you know when you got a lot of you

[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:27.120]
know make the big bucks a lot of money to throw away and I really got garbage done this fly I would

[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:31.140]
be embarrassed to tell you how much I paid on American Airlines I'd be embarrassed to hear it

[01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:36.900]
how you would but you know in coach and I don't know how many airlines are doing this but American

[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:44.880]
is big into this now they have the barf bag meal not necessarily it's the B-stroll we were called

[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:50.320]
the barfstroll they they have if you're sitting in coach as you're boarding the plane when you're

[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:55.620]
going down the ramp the jet way to the plane they have a big thing there and they have these little blue

[01:51:55.620 --> 01:52:05.760]
bags yes blue bags blue bags that's the wrong color no that's the right color for the

[01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:13.920]
barfstroll bag it's the B-stroll meal on America now maybe somebody can tell me what's in the bag

[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:17.560]
because I know that whatever we ate in first class like I said was pretty good but was it

[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:23.160]
hell a lot better than what was ever in your barfstroll meal but I mean I know that nobody gets bargain

[01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:27.440]
rates because especially American them in Delta they got you an arm and a leg they really rape the

[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:34.260]
public I mean rape and as far as being ready when you are they're good and ready when they're ready

[01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:39.020]
okay that's when they'll take off when they get around to it and they jerk you around like crazy

[01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:45.680]
but in the meantime they give you a little barf bag to have your meal from and what could possibly

[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:52.700]
be in that bag here's pop it all hello I just want the Connecticut on Delta they've got what they

[01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:59.820]
call the sky deli now garbage at its finest okay true story I got out of four lawyers

[01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:04.900]
in the airport and they had this like cooler kind of a white thing there right they go don't forget

[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:10.060]
to grab your bag on the way yeah that's it right okay there was a banana a banana muffin and a little

[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:17.360]
thing orange juice okay fly to Cincinnati and then from Cincinnati I I had like only like a 40

[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:20.960]
minutes time between a live and air and getting on the plane to heart first like it's

[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:25.740]
grab anything to eat slice as a piece of like 350 oh I'll get that you know and it was nothing

[01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:30.960]
on there and then on the way back from Hartford last night these little snack days were like the

[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:36.380]
rice crispy the marshmallow thing with the rice crispy on it and how many still two oh okay it's

[01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:40.600]
ridiculous I mean nowadays and the plane was delayed like two and a half hours last night they

[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:44.340]
don't care no they really don't care I got you coming and going because they they got no

[01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:48.720]
competition yeah I mean for a big shot like you you got the big bucks you can fly first first

[01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:53.820]
last god bless you for the as porcelainers in the back yeah you know so that's what's in the barf bag

[01:53:54.220 --> 01:54:05.400]
dyob pal bring your own barf bag is what I say what do you say his wife had a wife a little bit in it

[01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:12.220]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty I'm not going to play the whole thing it's

[01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:16.380]
old and stay like that stuff work was playing last week I think Rick was just basically trying to

[01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:20.680]
say is uh well I don't want to pull words in this mouth but I think he was saying I don't give a

[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:24.120]
more and who would blame I'm coming in on a day when he finds out that his station is doing this

[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:29.040]
real bad desperate publicity stunt with at OJCraft because you're on four to such a major asshole

[01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:34.760]
well that was a great lunch but I think I'm done okay coast is clear I'm done with that lunch

[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:40.100]
it was great but why didn't they always have to put like three three pounds of salad in there you know

[01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:43.380]
I mean a little bit of that is good it's good ruffids it'll help you you know

[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:49.860]
but a little lighten up a little bit on a salad please on all that all that greens please

[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:58.020]
I feel like Paul Prudome ever see him now he know you you realize he does that show sitting on a chair

[01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:01.280]
you are aware of that the cooking show no you want to wear that

[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:07.940]
well see the interesting part of it is I'm not joking about this either Paul Prudome is

[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:11.740]
that New Orleans chef that weighs 800 pounds that looks like Dom Delewese times two

[01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:19.380]
he can't he can't move he does that show sitting like on a stool on his stool

[01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:26.160]
and I caught a couple minutes over the weekend because when you're in a hotel room in Vegas I mean

[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:28.940]

[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:11.680]
old parts from WKAT from 23 years ago that were giving me a son of dance I'd never last six

[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:22.100]
months in his town guess what the good news is they're all dead oh thank the Lord so how's the

[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:27.800]
teenage God Squad coming out there huh they've all found the Lord in Jesus and uh not that they got

[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:32.980]
that martyr yeah they got a martyr that's right he says you believe in God she said I believe in

[02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:37.660]
God and he said yeah maybe you'll find God now maybe you'll be with him that's why God let it

[02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:41.840]
happen yeah that's why God let it happen that's right that's why I let him pull a trigger let's pick

[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:52.520]
up some interest yeah I mean you talk about having no brain at all okay something grotesque and horrendous

[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:57.000]
happens like that which shows us that as people we have to take more individual responsibility and

[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.600]
stop with the fairy tales and instead all the young people now they tell us are turning to a fairy

[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:10.600]
tales another cop out for the human race and that guy that gave me that facts by the way three or four

[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:16.980]
weeks ago about that analogy I gave about the rose that's the perfect analogy the perfect analogy okay

[02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:25.460]
whether it's a rose or a dog or a cockroach or whatever it is it's born it lives and it dies okay

[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:33.100]
like that bumper sticker says what does the bumper sticker say you know the one I'm talking about

[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:37.960]
you live your life and the life sucks and then you die or something like whatever that is

[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:46.460]
that's it so make hey while a son of shining okay because after that it's going to be a long

[02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:53.960]
nap which I notice most of your course search had a lot of practice here's the lady in homestead hello

[02:03:54.520 --> 02:04:00.340]
hi Neil yes man how are you great good good I just wanted to add to what the previous gentleman said

[02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:06.660]
regarding the Delta deli right and I want to hear about the American Varshtrel bag too I want to hear

[02:04:06.660 --> 02:04:12.580]
what's in that well I'm sorry I should take fortunately I haven't had to have anything like that

[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:21.980]
but I flew last week on Delta and I got the deli bag and the banana that was in my bag

[02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:28.860]
yeah it was just crushed to death oh yeah I know I know there's nothing worse than having your banana

[02:04:28.860 --> 02:04:36.220]
crushed that's true and stupid me I asked for another deli bag I got another one and the banana

[02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:44.500]
was even worse all right yeah I told the the way I mean as stewardess this one was bad as well and

[02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:52.300]
she looked at me and said that was the second thing she said but the first thing she said was

[02:04:52.300 --> 02:05:01.060]
what do you want me to do yeah I think I think we just heard the answer right exactly so in closing

[02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:06.060]
Walter wise you're a pool queen in douchebag okay sweetheart thanks thanks

[02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:14.680]
those bananas watch those cars bananas honey oh I mean why a piece of food oh and guess what when

[02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:19.980]
they're when they're taking off they make the announcement about the because these are these uh what

[02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:26.260]
is what are they um in eighties whatever they are there's a little crappy planes coming back the one

[02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:30.480]
from Vegas to Dallas and from Dallas there they were both the identical plane because we had the

[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:37.220]
bulkhead the same exact seats on both planes crappy planes puddle jumpers and so they have a limited

[02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:43.200]
amount of room for you know luggage so they're talking about be sure and put you know one piece of

[02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:47.920]
luggage in the overhead and anything else has to go under your seat and also in in coach be sure

[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:56.520]
and place your bistro bag under the seat for takeoff now this is the bag that has your luncheon it okay

[02:05:57.780 --> 02:06:04.040]
place it under the seat where god only knows what kind of stuff is hanging out from that seat for takeoff

[02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:12.920]
why why why can't you like hold it in your lap and the bag too can't do that we'll throw you

[02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:15.920]
we'll throw your overboard okay on the year seat

[02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:23.700]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one on before I leave here today I will find out what's in

[02:06:23.700 --> 02:06:27.240]
that barfster bag somebody will call and I was saying to john you'll be they could save it they're

[02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:31.420]
always worried about saving money they could save a lot more money by also making those the barf bags

[02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:36.360]
why do they have to have special blue bags why can't they just put the lunch in your barf

[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:39.900]
bag and when you're finished with lunch you stick it in a behind that little thing in front of you

[02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:45.260]
behind the magazine and if you do eat the barf meal probably will be uh

[02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:48.600]
using the bag real quick anyway

[02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:55.580]
the airline suck let's face it mo I do love virgin Atlantic I love them they're great

[02:06:56.900 --> 02:07:00.220]
alitatio once they get you off the ground on the ground it's typical of tight and confusion

[02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:06.360]
but once they get in the air they're great food is good but most airlines let's face it they suck

[02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:10.260]

[02:08:13.580 --> 02:08:17.300]
Now the biggest apple find another word to use.

[02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:19.080]
It used to be real bad.

[02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:21.080]
But now it seems okay.

[02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:25.160]
When African Americans address themselves that way.

[02:08:25.460 --> 02:08:27.220]
I'm a year younger and younger.

[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:28.200]
She's a bigger wearer.

[02:08:28.380 --> 02:08:31.260]
I'll take her booze no longer the vernacular

[02:08:31.260 --> 02:08:33.140]
voracial abuse.

[02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:35.180]
It used to be taboo.

[02:08:35.660 --> 02:08:37.140]
A nasty thing to say.

[02:08:37.660 --> 02:08:41.280]
But now we stand eat all about my black folks every day.

[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:42.880]
Yo.

[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:44.520]
I'm a senior year in a year.

[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:45.260]
He's not a huge hunter.

[02:08:45.420 --> 02:08:46.220]
We're all bigger booze.

[02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:47.560]
I'm a senior year.

[02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:48.460]
He's a senior year.

[02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:48.800]
He's a senior year.

[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:50.060]
We're all bigger booze.

[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:51.360]
I'm sick of watching things.

[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:52.320]
I'm kind to your ass.

[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:53.100]
Who is to?

[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:54.340]
It really does.

[02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:54.920]
It matters.

[02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:58.560]
I'm supposed to have everyone in my house.

[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:00.280]
Woohoo!

[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:02.800]
Yo.

[02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:03.560]
Yo.

[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:04.300]
Yo.

[02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:04.780]

[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:04.900]
Yo.

[02:09:05.940 --> 02:09:06.820]
Check it out.

[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:11.160]
I'll be grandmas' soup.

[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:14.280]
I'll be wishing my faith.

[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:17.140]
Laying with my record.

[02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:21.160]
I'll be twisting it.

[02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:24.120]
I got risen.

[02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:26.380]
Stop there, too, dude.

[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:29.420]
Put the lotion in the back.

[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:30.140]
Welcome.

[02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:33.260]
Okay, 1245 at 560WQA.

[02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:34.720]
I just want to say this right now.

[02:09:34.940 --> 02:09:35.880]
And I've mentioned it before.

[02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:38.220]
Anybody that says no matter what your rustkin color is.

[02:09:38.300 --> 02:09:40.660]
If you say check it out, that means you're an asshole.

[02:09:42.260 --> 02:09:46.560]
Nobody with an IQ larger than their thumbnail says check it out.

[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:48.120]
You know what I mean, Sam?

[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:51.540]
567-05, maybe redneck, say check it out.

[02:09:51.660 --> 02:09:52.120]
I don't think so.

[02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:56.700]
Oh, anyway, here's the fact from somebody who works for American Airlines who knows what's in the bar store bag.

[02:09:57.440 --> 02:09:58.500]
One ham and cheese sandwich.

[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:00.860]
A bag of laced potato chips.

[02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:03.140]
One famous anus cookie.

[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:06.360]
A little thing of mustard for your sandwich.

[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:08.940]
And you get a drink after you board the plane, of course.

[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:14.020]
So, as I'm old enough to remember when we had regulation, the only way the airlines could compete was on service.

[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:16.980]
I used to work for Eastern where they had five star dinner service.

[02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:17.880]
Those were the days.

[02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:19.900]
Thanks to all your Republicans who deregulated those.

[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:21.600]
Now we're just a bus in the sky.

[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:22.820]
Very well put.

[02:10:23.100 --> 02:10:24.180]
A bus in the sky.

[02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:24.760]
Nice going.

[02:10:26.740 --> 02:10:27.100]
Yep.

[02:10:27.980 --> 02:10:30.920]
And I'm not saying most of the people that work on the airlines are on the planes.

[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:32.540]
The stewies, the flight attendant.

[02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:32.880]
Sorry.

[02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:34.660]
Are pretty nice.

[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:37.200]
Some of them are pretty nice and some are nice and not.

[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:40.600]
But nevertheless, they do their best and they put up a lot of crap from the public.

[02:10:41.140 --> 02:10:42.820]
They have to deal with the public, which you're most of us hate.

[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:46.180]
But nevertheless, they're limited in what they can do.

[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:48.940]
The only thing you know what bothers me tremendously.

[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:50.240]
I mean, I don't know about you.

[02:10:50.960 --> 02:11:00.380]
But when you finally land on a plane that's delayed and you're trying to make a connection or you've just flown a long time and you just want to get off that plane and get your car and hope you might get home alive.

[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:03.500]
They land and they finally get the damn.

[02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:08.040]
You know, the idiot is getting the door on a jetway there aligned with the door on the plane.

[02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:11.680]
And they finally open the door and you're up there in first class.

[02:11:11.980 --> 02:11:15.700]
And with me, I'm always, or virtually always the first one there.

[02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:18.040]
I grabbed my bag from the overhead and zoom.

[02:11:18.260 --> 02:11:19.480]
I'm right there at the front of the plane.

[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:21.960]
I'm the first one on.

[02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:22.940]
I'm the first one off.

[02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:28.860]
And they open the door and the jackass from the airline on the inside.

[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:32.880]
They have to stand there and play little grab ass with each other while you're standing there waiting up.

[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:37.520]
Can I get off now while you're talking about how many goddamn wheelchairs you need or whatever else you're talking about?

[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:38.180]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:11:40.980 --> 02:11:46.960]
In fact, you know, when they're adjusting the thing and they get on the phone with each other anyway, why can't they just say, I need two wheels.

[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:50.140]
I got two games back here and they two crypts and they, you know, something.

[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:53.340]
And then open the door and let us out.

[02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:55.980]
I got one stiff and two crypts in the back, okay?

[02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:58.660]
So I mean, they need two chairs in a box.

[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:01.040]
It's the four lottery.

[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:03.620]
I don't fly to four lottery anymore because you can't park there.

[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:07.220]
But boy, every time I used to fly to four lottery, we need 48 wheelchairs.

[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:11.260]
It's the geriatric special.

[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:13.080]
The death express.

[02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:15.960]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:16.320]
Hello.

[02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:17.660]
A meal.

[02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:18.160]
Yes, sir.

[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:21.440]
It's so true about the flights coming back into Florida.

[02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:22.620]
The cemetery express.

[02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:27.440]
I think like you can get out of Florida by coming back in if they do the pre-boarding for all the old folks.

[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:32.060]
Not so bad in Miami, but when you're flying a lot of day, I guess it's all the brower people, you know.

[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:34.760]
But they do pre-boarding and the plane's already full.

[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:36.420]
So when I get on, it's only me loading.

[02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:36.980]
Uh-huh.

[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:41.200]
It's hysterical, but those American airlines do stack things that give you.

[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:42.920]
They're trojians.

[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:45.100]
The sandwiches are as hard as hockey fugs.

[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:50.240]
They give you these sundry fruit things and I would feed it to my dog.

[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:50.940]
Yeah.

[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:54.880]
But I went to Toronto this weekend and had a fantastic time.

[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:56.920]
Everything you said about it is right on the mine.

[02:12:57.060 --> 02:12:57.720]
Great city, man.

[02:12:57.920 --> 02:12:59.700]
And air Canada, right on the money.

[02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:01.840]
Actually had a real meal on air Canada.

[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:02.840]
And I was so surprised.

[02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:03.540]
I was kind of shocked.

[02:13:03.700 --> 02:13:04.280]
I'm so used to flying.

[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:06.940]
And if we don't get carried away, the food is okay on air Canada.

[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:07.520]
It's not great.

[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:08.760]
They would be better than that.

[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:11.200]
They would be better than the hockey fugs.

[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:11.820]
Let me tell you.

[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:12.040]
Right.

[02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:13.780]
And the one another hockey fugs.

[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:20.160]
The only bad thing about Toronto is, I guess, because of the economy so bad right now, there are a lot of homeless people.

[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:21.940]
No, I've got nothing to do with the economy.

[02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:22.760]
It's always that way.

[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:25.880]
I mean, before you notice how polite they are though.

[02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:28.000]
Oh yeah, it's a spare-fin change, mister.

[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:29.220]
And you can barely even hear them.

[02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:31.200]
And even if you walk on by, thanks anyway.

[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:32.020]
Have a good night, eh?

[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:34.860]
And they don't want money for food.

[02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:36.640]
They want money for coffee and I'm not here, right?

[02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:36.980]

[02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:43.000]
And talk about sports fans here, of course, you know, it's just all the social occasions.

[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:46.680]
But there they live, being breathed, you know, hockey and baseball.

[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:48.320]
And it was quite impressive.

[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:49.260]
Well, I'm glad it's over.

[02:13:49.460 --> 02:13:50.460]
Okay, enough for one year.

[02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:51.420]
At least had a nice run.

[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:52.320]
Now it's all over.

[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:54.420]
Now maybe on a weekend there will be some people out on the street.

[02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:57.820]
And they will be bowling from 7 to 10 a night on a young street.

[02:13:58.260 --> 02:13:58.800]
Very true.

[02:13:59.020 --> 02:14:05.600]
It's sad though that you know, I went by the old, I mean, police gardens and talk about a mothball, you know.

[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:07.760]
It's kind of sad in a way.

[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:08.400]
Okay, pal.

[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:09.200]
See you on church street.

[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:09.980]
Have a good one.

[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:13.680]
Okay. You know, I think I'm going to have a experience any second now, you know?

[02:14:14.100 --> 02:14:15.060]
I do mean any second.

[02:14:15.220 --> 02:14:15.860]
I mean, any minute.

[02:14:15.980 --> 02:14:17.480]
I mean, like any millisecond.

[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:20.520]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, pal.

[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:24.440]
When you know your system gets all messed up, I was thinking we should have sent, maybe it's getting a little bit late now.

[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:26.640]
We should have sent an FU and Sam out with a QA and van.

[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:30.800]
No, we could have given away some of Neil's chunks from the Vegas trip.

[02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:31.680]
Huh?

[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:33.320]
Some of Neil's bloody chunks.

[02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:34.720]
Hmm.

[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:37.360]
If I were to find a hand at the time, I would have saved some.

[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:39.800]
I would have brought back a whole sack full.

[02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:43.940]
I would have borrowed one of those empty bar throw bags and filled it up with Neil's chunks.

[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:50.180]
Hey, it's just as good as some of the other crap that they try to hand out with that stupid van.

[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:51.960]
Oh, here's another hit for the Neelies.

[02:14:52.700 --> 02:14:57.020]
We have free tickets to something that nobody in the world will take even if we put a $100 bill in the envelope.

[02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:02.580]
Well, that's because Sam is busy, you know, running around telling stories about all his friends.

[02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:04.940]
Here's a mobile and four-lotterdale.

[02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:05.200]
Hello.

[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:06.480]
Good Neil, how are you doing?

[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:07.060]
Okay, sir.

[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:08.800]
You all fly first class?

[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:09.960]
Always.

[02:15:11.020 --> 02:15:13.360]
Okay, so they don't give the Delhi bag to the first class today?

[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:14.000]
No, they don't.

[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:15.380]
That's why I was asking what's in them.

[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:17.980]
Okay, so I mean the bad is that they give.

[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:19.400]
Why they crushed.

[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:21.060]
Meaning what?

[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:23.600]
What are the stutuses that are doing with them?

[02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:24.400]
Yeah, okay, huh?

[02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:26.460]
Second call today for that asshole, okay?

[02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:28.660]
Glad we're keeping you off the streets, okay, pal?

[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:29.680]
Jackass?

[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:32.220]
We know what you're doing with him.

[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:35.460]
Here's a guy that's got a 1 banana in his mouth and 1 in his...

[02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:35.740]
Spectum.

[02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:37.140]
...which maybe balances it out.

[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:38.140]
Or maybe it's the same one.

[02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:43.240]
560-705-60, 0.560 on a mobile one line.

[02:15:44.140 --> 02:15:45.300]
Here's a mobile and pompano.

[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:45.520]
Hello.

[02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:46.700]
Hello Neil.

[02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:47.240]
Yes, sir.

[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:48.100]
That guy's...

[02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:52.740]
We should all be so lucky for whoever called you from American Airlines about the B-still bags.

[02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:53.880]
Well, I sure didn't get that.

[02:15:54.340 --> 02:15:55.800]
I just flew back and forth to California.

[02:15:56.180 --> 02:15:56.660]
What did you get?

[02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:57.920]
I got...

[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:00.600]
Let's see, a small carton of orange juice.

[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:01.840]
A banana.

[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:04.560]
So...

[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:05.060]
How about the ball?

[02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:06.160]
This must have been a morning flight.

[02:16:06.260 --> 02:16:06.620]
Breakfast.

[02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:07.740]
Breakfast.

[02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:09.720]
It was also the way 2.5 hours.

[02:16:10.220 --> 02:16:13.620]
The sun, the sun, the dried cherries and raisins.

[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:16.340]
And you had your main meal, a little carton of yogurt.

[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:19.920]
And then on another...

[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:22.980]
Having a perfect leg of the flight, you did get...

[02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:26.320]
You got like kind of a small turkey sandwich.

[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:30.320]
Like all wrapped up, you know, wrapped in real pie in the saran wrap on a tiny bite.

[02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:30.580]

[02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:32.820]
So, one can stay up for the 4-5 hours that's sitting around, right?

[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:34.760]
And the mustard, a little mustard.

[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:36.000]
And I don't even think...

[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.680]
I think the best thing I got in the second bag was like a little package of the

[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:40.320]
Peppers from Milano Cookies.

[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:41.040]
Oh, yeah.

[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:41.980]
Yeah, they were real good.

[02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:43.040]
And that was it.

[02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:43.460]
I mean, I...

[02:16:43.460 --> 02:16:44.440]
I mean, the famous anus, those are good.

[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:45.140]
Yeah, but we know...

[02:16:45.140 --> 02:16:46.760]
So, of course, you can only eat one bag, you know.

[02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:47.720]
You were talking about the...

[02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:51.460]
I heard you talking about American Airlines food, and I was wondering what the hell you were talking about.

[02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:52.060]
First plan.

[02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:53.000]
I think it was first plan.

[02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:57.320]
I just walked into the door a second ago, and someone was talking about Ben and Jerry's ice cream.

[02:16:57.680 --> 02:16:59.380]
Was he talking about the new flavors at all?

[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:04.340]
No, he's just...

[02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:07.120]
Oh, because there's a beginner.

[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:11.740]
They made kind of a second version, a second or a version, a fish food called Bovenity Divinity,

[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:18.640]
which is white chocolate ice cream with dark chocolate cows, instead of the fish that are dark chocolate cows,

[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:22.620]
and that's swirled with dark chocolate ice cream and white chocolate cows.

[02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:23.800]
Oh, my God.

[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:27.800]
And it's a little less guilty than the fish food, and I saw it out in the comments.

[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:31.920]
Well, because you don't have the marshmallow and the caramel swirl through it.

[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:35.720]
It's lighter ice cream, which is ice cream in the cow chunks.

[02:17:35.980 --> 02:17:36.180]
Yeah.

[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:37.100]
And boy, it is.

[02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:38.040]
Oh, my God, my own chunks.

[02:17:38.060 --> 02:17:38.620]
I don't need that.

[02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:42.960]
And they also have like a triple caramel chunk, which is caramel ice cream with chunks of caramel.

[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:44.200]
Yeah.

[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:48.200]
And they have like a mocha latte, I think, which is a low fat ice cream.

[02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:48.780]
No, not for me.

[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:49.580]
I don't want a low fat ice cream.

[02:17:49.580 --> 02:17:50.200]
I want high fat.

[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:50.720]
I had...

[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:54.740]
I saw the Bovenity Divinity for the first time down here in the public scene yesterday.

[02:17:55.460 --> 02:17:56.060]
Bovenity Divinity...

[02:17:56.060 --> 02:17:56.760]
Oh, I like the name, anyway.

[02:17:57.420 --> 02:17:58.060]
Bovenity Divinity.

[02:17:58.060 --> 02:17:59.780]
And again, my wife's still driving us.

[02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:02.220]
She can actually keep a carton in there for like a week.

[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:04.120]
She will like a little at a time.

[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:05.560]
Oh, I can't...

[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:06.300]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:08.160]
I will admit this.

[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:10.980]
I've had a pint in for like two days, okay?

[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:12.200]
That's my record.

[02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:17.040]
But maybe I went out at night and I got it and ate half of it, and was able to save some for the next day.

[02:18:17.100 --> 02:18:19.560]
And as soon as I got home from work, I immediately sucked it down.

[02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:23.140]
But me or nearly, the pint is gone.

[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:25.300]
I have to give her an ultimatum at times, just to listen.

[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:27.540]
If it's not there, if you don't finish your pint tonight, it's not going to be...

[02:18:27.540 --> 02:18:30.880]
Oh, and somebody said a couple weeks ago they're starting to make it in quartz, is that true?

[02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:32.860]
I've seen some. I've seen some flavors in here.

[02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:33.800]
Oh, no!

[02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:37.840]
And now, yeah, I've seen very few of the flavors in quartz like maybe just...

[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:37.980]
Thank God.

[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:39.180]
Don't do it.

[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:41.700]
Maybe they're just like vanilla and they're chocolate chip or something.

[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:46.460]
But I mean, I can just sit there and eat a pint with the freezer door open while I'm standing.

[02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:47.780]
You're looking at the clock, and you have sex.

[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.220]
Well, it takes me 37 seconds to get out of the microwave, and once I'm on the loose with that.

[02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:54.140]
Well, look at your public scene.

[02:18:54.220 --> 02:18:57.220]
I think there's going to be just this big overrun on the Bovenity Divinity here.

[02:18:57.220 --> 02:18:58.220]
There is on a fish, we'll get down there.

[02:18:58.220 --> 02:18:59.500]
Okay, I'll be there at 245.

[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:00.460]
Damn good. Thanks.

[02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:00.820]
I know.

[02:19:01.260 --> 02:19:02.480]
I have sounds good for today.

[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:04.980]
Get that blancher up there at about 350, 375.

[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:06.600]
Come on, crank that baby up, okay?

[02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:08.820]
Why not? You only live once.

[02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:11.500]
Always health nuts out there like me.

[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:12.400]
You know, that's screw it.

[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:13.620]
You know, see, take a pillar or two.

[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:16.140]
Then, of course, it gets to the part where the pills don't work anymore.

[02:19:16.380 --> 02:19:17.480]
And you start on the insulin shots.

[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:19.520]
And then, you know, you go blind and you lose your legs.

[02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:20.820]
But, hey, it was a lot of fun in the meantime.

[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:23.000]
Wasn't it?

[02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:27.900]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on a mobile one line.

[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.100]
They're addicting us to crap that's killing us.

[02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:31.140]
Where's your God now?

[02:19:31.420 --> 02:19:33.280]
I'll tell you what, then God's not at the supermarket.

[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:35.540]
I'll tell you that.

[02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:38.400]
You walk into a public restroom.

[02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:40.000]
God sure isn't in there.

[02:19:41.220 --> 02:19:44.560]
Because if he were God stinks, I'll tell you that right now, okay?

[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.800]
If God is in the toilet, God stinks like crap.

[02:19:49.380 --> 02:19:49.860]
Christ.

[02:19:51.740 --> 02:19:52.900]
Where the hell was it?

[02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:54.860]
I walked into a public, must have been the airport.

[02:19:56.620 --> 02:19:57.260]
To take a leak.

[02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:00.000]
I walked in there, I thought, man, it smells like a toilet in here.

[02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:00.800]
God.

[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:06.160]
Although, you know, when you walk into some of the public restroom,

[02:20:06.160 --> 02:20:09.900]
and you read the graffiti, you have to assume that maybe God was in there at one time, you know.

[02:20:11.500 --> 02:20:13.320]
Maybe doing the limbo rock under the stall there.

[02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:16.640]
According to what Tim Russell's wife, whatever her name was.

[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:19.120]
Who was famous for about two minutes once you wrote that book?

[02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:21.740]
By the way, how's Andrew Koonan and Junior doing these days?

[02:20:23.540 --> 02:20:25.520]
1256 at 560 WQA.

[02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:26.240]
I'm serious.

[02:20:26.620 --> 02:20:29.620]
You know how every day has its own particular feeling to it?

[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:30.360]
I'm numb.

[02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:31.460]
I have no idea.

[02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:34.880]
I know it's Tuesday, but other than that, I just, I'm in limbo.

[02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:36.160]
Is it only me?

[02:20:37.540 --> 02:20:37.640]
Huh?

[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:40.320]
I just, this day doesn't have any field to it.

[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:45.020]
It's like I know that I'm here, and I'm not all that excited about it,

[02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:47.660]
but it's just, yeah, yeah, like that.

[02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:47.960]
Yeah.

[02:20:56.040 --> 02:20:58.340]
It's the water just in a hour.

[02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:05.560]
Well, it works in low-bears.

[02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:08.100]
And I've got no fears.

[02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:12.460]
Both of you go where no men don't be foamy.

[02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:19.100]
The body goes and lifts, and moves as well.

[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:23.260]
That's why your face says we do and see.

[02:21:24.820 --> 02:21:27.460]
The evil leaves is just dead.

[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:30.400]
They said it's heinous.

[02:21:31.060 --> 02:21:35.400]
But like a faith man, I'm so good in Uranus.

[02:21:36.140 --> 02:21:39.420]
It tastes like a candy to me.

[02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:45.240]
The wind and the inter-riding sea,

[02:21:45.700 --> 02:21:50.580]
your moon is shining on me.

[02:21:52.380 --> 02:21:55.680]
It's like a penny to me.

[02:21:57.360 --> 02:21:59.300]
Well, say, then, be brave.

[02:22:00.200 --> 02:22:06.100]
The tumble-out dance I just gave, makes the hero my dad stand straight up.

[02:22:07.860 --> 02:22:11.200]
Now I'm a real super god of life,

[02:22:11.420 --> 02:22:13.120]
I'm a big hero super.

[02:22:14.100 --> 02:22:20.840]
Please, I love you, tell us it, because I got a must-see to be,

[02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:23.900]
my friend's calling number two.

[02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:29.380]
I heard you yelling, Chacha, but I prefer to do.

[02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:33.420]
It tastes like a baby to me.

[02:22:34.720 --> 02:22:39.280]
The sweetest way to life is,

[02:22:40.420 --> 02:22:44.400]
the moon is shining on me.

[02:22:46.280 --> 02:22:49.860]
It's like a penny to me.

[02:22:51.680 --> 02:22:56.500]
Now, food on ways I came while the starless, I'm going inside.

[02:22:57.780 --> 02:23:00.880]
Trust me, I won't hurt you.

[02:23:02.580 --> 02:23:08.120]
Things get not delusious when I see rail door to roof to a tomb.

[02:23:08.660 --> 02:23:11.740]
And the whole star's down with not so bruised.

[02:23:13.620 --> 02:23:15.360]
When will I do?

[02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:18.100]
Please, miss, feel it like a man.

[02:23:19.100 --> 02:23:23.560]
You'll find it hard to sit down when I get done with your can.

[02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:27.720]
It tastes like a penny to me.

[02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:33.300]
The sweetest way to life is,

[02:23:34.820 --> 02:23:39.680]
the moon is shining on me.

[02:23:41.380 --> 02:23:49.540]
It's like a penny to me.

[02:23:51.720 --> 02:23:54.060]
By the way, take your time reading that catalog, George,

[02:23:54.200 --> 02:23:56.700]
because you won't want to come back in here any time too soon.

[02:23:56.700 --> 02:23:59.280]
Because it smells like a penny in here.

[02:23:59.940 --> 02:24:00.920]
It's four minutes after.

[02:24:01.100 --> 02:24:03.540]
Well, you know what I'm doing my best to prolong the inevitable.

[02:24:03.860 --> 02:24:07.160]
You know, I'm kind of leaning up until thing is leaking here and there.

[02:24:07.460 --> 02:24:09.080]
And, you know, very successfully so far.

[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.300]
Here's the fact that I'm glad you had a great time in Vegas.

[02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:13.300]
I'll be there in two weeks.

[02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:14.760]
One thing I'm curious about.

[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:17.080]
You haven't mentioned, did you get the freebie meal out the Rosewood Grill?

[02:24:17.260 --> 02:24:17.440]
No.

[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:18.980]
Didn't have the Rosewood Grill.

[02:24:19.300 --> 02:24:20.560]
Like I said, I didn't have time.

[02:24:22.100 --> 02:24:24.880]
There's just only so much time in a 24-hour day.

[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:27.080]
And last time I checked, it was only 24 hours.

[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:28.920]
And when I'm in Vegas, I don't sleep that much.

[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:32.800]
First night I got to bed about quarter to three in the morning.

[02:24:32.980 --> 02:24:34.700]
I was up at 7.45.

[02:24:35.780 --> 02:24:40.720]
Second night, Sunday, got to bed around three in the morning and got up at 8.45.

[02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:41.720]
That's it.

[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:43.220]
Who wants to sleep in Vegas?

[02:24:44.620 --> 02:24:46.180]
All depending on who you're sleeping with, right?

[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:49.760]
So no, I did not go to the Rosewood Grill.

[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:53.920]
I didn't get a comp there, but I'm sure you will, because here's a guy that gets comped at the MGM and at the prompt.

[02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:57.480]
And I would do, okay, all the money I drop out there, but I'm just a puss.

[02:24:57.940 --> 02:25:01.360]
Like I said, let me spend more, which means better for the rest of you.

[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:07.000]
I'm not one of those cheekbackers that's looking for everything at a discount, everything wholesale, everything for free.

[02:25:08.620 --> 02:25:11.660]
5.670560, pound 5.60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:13.900]
Searching for a satellite signal.

[02:25:14.060 --> 02:25:15.740]
But it must be the end of the world out there, you know?

[02:25:16.700 --> 02:25:17.760]
Too bad we don't have a window.

[02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:19.680]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:25:19.820 --> 02:25:19.940]
Hello.

[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:21.380]
Hello, Neil.

[02:25:21.380 --> 02:25:21.900]
Yes, sir.

[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:24.560]
Yeah, first time call a long time listener.

[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:26.480]
Hello.

[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:27.360]
Yes, sir, I'm listening.

[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:29.520]
Yeah, I work out here for the catering company.

[02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:30.600]
They cater to American Airlines.

[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:31.180]
Uh-huh.

[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:34.500]
And yeah, they exactly like what the guy put on the facts.

[02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:38.260]
You get a bag of waffles and half a tuna.

[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:40.120]
I mean, a half of a turkey sandwich.

[02:25:40.980 --> 02:25:41.340]
Yeah.

[02:25:41.660 --> 02:25:42.720]
But the flight time is average.

[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:44.740]
The flight time is average even worse than that.

[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:45.780]
They get even less than that.

[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:48.860]
Flight time is getting like an ounce of tuna.

[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:49.500]
Yeah.

[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:52.700]
And, uh, and, uh, and, uh, stay or bread like a pita bread.

[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:54.920]
Well, that's not because we don't want to fly to tenons.

[02:25:54.940 --> 02:25:56.680]
Can any stomach problems be off?

[02:25:56.780 --> 02:25:58.480]
Because, uh, that's the last thing we need is them.

[02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:02.500]
Uh, the worst thing they ever met when a captain comes out and uses the first class toilet.

[02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:04.460]
You know, get out of there, okay?

[02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:06.040]
Because, uh, it's supposed to be for us.

[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:06.840]
We're paying on this.

[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:07.580]
We're not getting paid.

[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:10.100]
Yeah, but you don't see it when you guys get off the plane.

[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:10.600]
Yeah.

[02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:12.180]
The next flight attendants that come on board.

[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:14.400]
They're searching for the whole left over the side of the car.

[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:17.660]
To see what they can eat because, you know, they don't get no food more than that.

[02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:18.000]
Really?

[02:26:18.460 --> 02:26:18.780]
Yeah.

[02:26:19.260 --> 02:26:22.480]
So, you know, they'll search around the trees and they'll find like an orange, you know.

[02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:24.200]
They didn't have.

[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:26.420]
Okay, I'll start leaving a little something behind from now.

[02:26:27.580 --> 02:26:28.820]
Okay, thanks for the good news, pal.

[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:29.380]
Okay, you made it.

[02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:34.360]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:26:34.460 --> 02:26:36.340]
I just, I don't know about that kind of a job, you know?

[02:26:37.580 --> 02:26:39.340]
Because talk about being a captive audience.

[02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:43.800]
I mean, uh, almost anywhere any other kind of a job, even like those waitresses at the year,

[02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:47.840]
you know, in wolfies and the old days that would rip off their apron and scream,

[02:26:48.060 --> 02:26:49.340]
I can't take it anymore.

[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:51.560]
People are media and it would run out, you know?

[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:53.480]
I saw that happen at least two or three times.

[02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:58.140]
At least they had somewhere to go, but on a plane, you're like kind of a captive audience.

[02:26:58.820 --> 02:27:00.400]
We're nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

[02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:06.880]
An addition to which, how long did they get to stay over, you know, when they go somewhere?

[02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:09.280]
It depends.

[02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:10.340]
Maybe a day.

[02:27:10.980 --> 02:27:11.680]
Maybe a weekend.

[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:13.720]
I don't even imagine a weekend, probably like a day.

[02:27:15.500 --> 02:27:19.320]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:20.580]
Here's a lady in Port St. Lucie.

[02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:20.800]
Hello.

[02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:22.040]
Yeah, Neil God.

[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:22.740]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:23.060]
Yes.

[02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:26.620]
I flew on American, but this is a year and a half ago.

[02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:29.900]
So we only had like a half a sandwich of like ham and cheese.

[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:30.400]
Yeah.

[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:35.300]
The bags of mini-cortiacips, that there were like three or four of these mini-cortiacips in the bag.

[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:40.420]
And they actually had water in there, but it was like this thing that you just peeled the wood off of this thing,

[02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:42.820]
the smaller than one of those yellow things you get in the public.

[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:46.400]
I mean, the water actually in the bag, I started laughing my butt off.

[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:46.700]
Yeah.

[02:27:46.900 --> 02:27:47.560]
And then the cookie.

[02:27:48.260 --> 02:27:49.560]
It was laughable.

[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:50.920]
So I always bring like that.

[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:56.740]
Yeah, I don't want you to feel that, but in the first class they had those fresh chocolate chip cookies, you know, that they heat up in the oven?

[02:27:56.980 --> 02:27:59.880]
Oh, well, we actually sat in this book, as he said, we're talking about another.

[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:03.280]
And the 80 or whatever, heck not the M80, but the 80 super whatever they call it.

[02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:03.820]
Right, that's a crap.

[02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:07.520]
Yeah, we could peek through the curtains and they were getting, we thought it'd speak, come out.

[02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:10.840]
And I had the little salt and pepper, you know, shaker, we're really not that bad.

[02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:13.280]
Yeah, and it really is in first class in American, the food is very good.

[02:28:14.140 --> 02:28:17.180]
Yeah, well, we had the box bag.

[02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:18.260]
Okay, good luck.

[02:28:18.620 --> 02:28:19.260]
All right, thanks now.

[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:19.720]
See ya.

[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:19.960]
Bye.

[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:21.880]
5607able.

[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:24.780]
0560, 0560, 0560 on the ATT.

[02:28:24.780 --> 02:28:25.400]
What was that?

[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:26.760]
I thought like I was missing something.

[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:27.200]
What did he say?

[02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:28.300]
Did you guys eat already?

[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:32.260]
Oh, that's right, Sam.

[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:34.100]
I guess he must have missed lunch already.

[02:28:34.220 --> 02:28:36.460]
Is busy gossiping around and building, telling all those great stories.

[02:28:37.140 --> 02:28:38.300]
Yeah, we already ate, Sam.

[02:28:38.540 --> 02:28:38.760]
Sorry.

[02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:41.460]
But we'll be sure and miss you next time.

[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:46.920]
5607, 0560, 0560 on the ATT wireless line.

[02:28:47.020 --> 02:28:49.160]
It's 9 minutes after 1 at 560, QM, the heck.

[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:51.500]
Did he ask you to check and he'd stop dancing?

[02:29:30.020 --> 02:29:30.660]

happens to be black even though he's an uncle time and he hates them like poison and wants nothing

[02:46:06.140 --> 02:46:12.420]
to do with them it's pathetic it's like standing up and saying hey i'm a moron you notice me over

talking about why do they think it's funny when the flag crew on southwest airlines are making jokes

[02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:27.220]
doing about Seattle believe that those people probably work for like you know continental or something

[02:46:27.220 --> 02:46:33.820]
that are calling it about southwest making jokes no jokes we don't want the pilot on there making

[02:46:33.820 --> 02:46:38.240]
funny and you know another thing that pilots do and i realize that they can't hear it because they're

[02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:43.280]
off in the cockpit and we're sitting back in the you know cabin but there's nothing more aggravating

[02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:46.380]
especially when you're hoping maybe to get some information about when you're gonna arrive your

[02:46:46.380 --> 02:46:54.280]
EPA or what's something you know and here and then you can't understand it's either distorted

[02:46:54.280 --> 02:47:00.400]

[02:50:36.830 --> 02:50:41.050]

[02:51:04.210 --> 02:51:09.950]

[02:51:09.950 --> 02:51:13.730]
that he was able to see a pragmatic sit the home run because you how did he spare time from being

[02:51:13.730 --> 02:51:20.270]
in the berthin maybe you saw it on the tv monitor huh there and that was the call of the year

[02:51:20.270 --> 02:51:27.390]
there that was the one that was the definitive i'm a sports nerd with no life call who was sitting

[02:51:27.390 --> 02:51:33.710]
out by john henry just like those cubs fans i was watching over the weekend in vegas on tv a little

[02:51:33.710 --> 02:51:40.250]
that cubs whoever the hell they were playing the cardinals and henry Rodriguez hits the home run

[02:51:40.250 --> 02:51:43.710]
and all of a sudden all these cubs fans are throwing oh Henry bars up which i never heard of that

[02:51:43.710 --> 02:51:47.130]
before i didn't know that they do that not that it hits that many home runs and they had a

[02:51:47.130 --> 02:51:52.170]
hold up the game for like 20 minutes i mean what do you do do you go to your convenience store

[02:51:52.170 --> 02:51:55.430]
before you go to the ballgame and you buy half of those no Henry bars is that what you do

[02:51:57.190 --> 02:52:02.270]
once the last time you had no Henry bar by the way ten years ago yeah you know why because they

[02:52:02.270 --> 02:52:07.490]
taste like crap yeah so throw them out on a field and that's exactly why who now wants to eat that crap
