So mouth!

[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.000]
Get it special day here in the world.

[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.360]
When the screening days meet the rest of the girls in the closet no more.

[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.060]
That's what day day is for.

[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.280]
It's a day day after all.

[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.080]
Ooooo!

[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.920]
Today of fun when we wear red shirts and when we all come, you can hear the squirts.

[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.440]
We can dig go and tease with our manicured goaties.

[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.740]
It's a day after all.

[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.220]
We'll be holding hands in it then cheerleaders watch the live.

[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.980]
The manally marching band will make your wrist street with a kiss on the cheek.

[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.260]
It's a day after all.

[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.700]
We can wear tight shorts, pay the gold one, make it wear mascara like billies, aint we

[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.880]
can mince away as we prance and sachet.

[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.860]
It's a day day after all.

[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.280]
Ooooo!

[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.320]
MGM will have a liberty ball hosted by a wrist-heller and a room ball.

[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.700]
There's a murder of a blacksmith who mentioned people like hot.

[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.720]
It's a day after all.

[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.960]
It's a day day after all.

[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.300]
It's a day day after all.

[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.000]
It's a day after all.

[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.380]
You got hanging out of your shorts.

[00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.780]
Oh you know the turkey leg.

[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.240]
Anybody want to buy a big bootleg black dildo?

[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.660]
Go see.

[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.700]
Go see Gackey!

[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.960]
Maybe Gackey's got him too.

[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.420]
He's right next door to the party.

[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.580]
Where do I start today?

[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.040]
I came in here with one agenda like a regular show and then all of a sudden for the last hour and ten minutes we've been terrorized by a madman.

[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.220]
We've been terrorized by someone grossly, grotesquely who's behavior is unacceptable.

[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.760]
I don't want to mention Todd Drek on the air but I will anyway.

[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.360]
I'm sitting here minding my own business, clipping some stuff out of the newspaper,

[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.780]
George is in there doing his thing, whatever he's doing, and we'll be in our own business.

[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.080]
He's going to do a radio show.

[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.380]
Trying to put the new book of Brian Bitson as well.

[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.860]
Which we didn't get around to do it all of them by the way because somebody came in here, two people came in here.

[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.580]
I realized I did go in there and I took a look at the studio so I could see my mentor Gildi and I'm calm down a little bit.

[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.840]
Okay.

[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.620]
Gildi is my hero.

[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.100]
He taught me my new philosophy of life which is...

[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.280]
I don't give a sh** anymore.

[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.640]
And he's right on target.

[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.180]
Thanks Gildi, you're my hero.

[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.240]
And you know something for the last couple of months, generally speaking I've held it that pretty well.

[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.500]
Generally speaking.

[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.020]
Now when it came up with my paycheck a day late I didn't make an exception there.

[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.480]
It frosted my ass a little bit.

[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.740]
As a matter of fact, I was heading out to dinner last night which I'll tell you about later.

[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:33.060]
Heading out to dinner in Mandu to just come on the air and he started out and he was talking about the fact that they thought the bulging was going to be at 830 to pregame last night.

[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.560]
It turned out to be 930 and it was still lost anyway but nevertheless.

[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.040]
And then he got a message from Duff that he would have to work three hours last night or three and a half or whatever.

[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.420]
And that there would be compensation though because there actually would be some checks in the mailbox when he came in.

[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.780]
And then he proceeded to read the dates on the paychecks that he got.

[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.100]
The first one was 411.

[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.160]
Then there was 1 418.

[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.380]
These are the dates that the checks were written, okay, over in Naples.

[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.580]
Then there was 1 5 11 and 5 18.

[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.820]
So in other words, 411, that's well over two months ago.

[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.780]
And he made an excellent point. He said, the beastly read people.

[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.100]
He said, this is the way they do business.

[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.400]
They would rather have the money in their bank account than you have it in yours as long as possible.

[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.240]
Am I right?

[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.760]
Yeah!

[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.500]
Yeah.

[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.500]
And I squeezed myself with a seven.

[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.840]
I was so, you know, the fact that somebody else had the balls on his station to tell it like it is.

[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.660]
Nice going, mad dog.

[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.580]
There's the one guy.

[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.100]
Oh, right.

[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.080]
Don't suck any ass.

[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.280]
That's right. That's the way they do business.

[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.760]
But you know something, even the check.

[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.720]
Okay, it showed up right in the early the next morning.

[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.420]
It was one day.

[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.980]
I mean, not the way you really do business, but nevertheless crap happens.

[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.300]
Okay?

[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.940]
Don't have a nervous breakdown about it.

[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.680]
And I didn't.

[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.640]
But this morning I'll make an exception.

[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.600]
Because I already had a nervous breakdown in this place.

[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.040]
Thanks to first, SCRUAN.

[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.260]
Our sales manager comes in here speaking of...

[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.480]
Roy!

[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.020]
And that big black dildo.

[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.140]
SCRUAN comes in here.

[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.760]
Now, I want you to picture this scene.

[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.100]
It's about the 840.

[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.780]
Because I'm in here.

[00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.160]
I don't know.

[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.680]
It's Tuesday.

[00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.880]
So my maid comes on Tuesday.

[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.500]
I leave the house earlier on Tuesday.

[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.540]
I'm sitting in here.

[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.380]
George is in the other room.

[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.660]
The door in between these two stairs is wide open.

[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.620]
It's the sounds of silence.

[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.880]
I have the monitor turned down.

[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:11.400]
There's nothing.

[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.740]
There's no sound at all.

[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.800]
So the wind comes in in the other room and says to George.

[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.600]
Like that.

[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.760]
And as low of a tone as humanly possible to make sure that I would not

[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.020]
be in here.

[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.680]
That she was up here on behalf of one of our sales holes who was the most

[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.520]
anxious excuse for a human being.

[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.380]
I've heard that 39 years have been in radio.

[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.800]
39 years.

[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.920]
I have never encountered a Todd Dreck.

[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.800]
Ever.

[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.760]
And look at all the sales holes that I've screamed about and carried on about over the years.

[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.080]
Is there anybody even close to his category?

[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.460]
No.

[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.760]
No.

[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.620]
And by the way, you can go run to Ray Perry all you want.

[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.600]
Ray Perry hasn't been anywhere near their studio since the week before April 1st when

[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.640]
the Marlon season started.

[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.800]
Walked in here and handed me my Marlon stickers in the parking passes.

[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.160]
Haven't seen a hide in her hair.

[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.020]
I bumped into her and saw her in a hallway one day.

[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.560]
That's the last time I saw one of our 85 sales managers, Ray Perry.

[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.460]
So Ray Perry hasn't got a freaking clue of anything that's going on in the studio.

[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.900]
When it comes to copy, when it comes to clients, when it comes to the program,

[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.760]
when it comes to ratings, when it comes to anything that's going on in here.

[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.960]
Because God only knows what his official function is around here.

[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.020]
He's another guy with a title that we have no idea what Ellie does.

[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.240]
Because it sure has nothing to do with this show.

[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.240]
And so finally after Skruan leaves here, whatever she's the whispering into George's ear.

[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.220]
She was the whispering, please make those air checks.

[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.780]
Please make sure you're refusing to make for too long.

[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.620]
Because you're faster and a liar and a piece of crap George.

[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.220]
Because you're a trouble making little spick.

[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.020]
What's your point?

[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.040]
So she no longer, the door hasn't even hit her in the ass yet on the way out.

[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.660]
And all of a sudden the door swings open.

[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.700]
And here comes public enemy number one, Todd Dreck.

[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.420]
Yeah, we'll give you an air check of this.

[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.940]
Okay, Todd, the whole show today.

[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.060]
We'll give you an air check up.

[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.260]
Because your behavior is effing unacceptable to me to George.

[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.360]
Anybody else with a brain?

[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.160]
To the people on the worst team there in the morning who were as soon as they hear your name.

[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.980]
They were doing cartwheels and screaming and making guttural sound.

[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.140]
How is it possible?

[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.000]
You know, the people over there are a queer channel that I and Z and I O D.

[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.780]
The queer channel people people, people who are vulnerable.

[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.640]
They couldn't believe.

[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.020]
First of all that we hired Fat Boy, that was number one.

[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.400]
But Fat Boy, like I said, he's a Mahaya.

[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.220]
He's a mench compared to this guy.

[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.060]
We love Fat Boy.

[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.440]
And then when they hired Todd Dreck in the sales over here, they were all going like...

[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.520]
Oh my god.

[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.000]
Yeah.

[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:46.960]
Like that.

[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.680]
What are those people thinking about?

[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.700]
You see this business isn't really all that complicated.

[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:01.680]
You go on the air, you try to build an audience, you do some promotion, which of course we don't do that here.

[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.020]
But nevertheless, we still got that audience out there.

[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.520]
You get some ratings and then your salespeople go out and they sell them.

[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.080]
Hey, we'd like to do, you know, make some business for you.

[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.540]
We're going to charge you some money.

[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.460]
We're going to make some money by selling you spots.

[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.500]
And then we're going to bring some business into your establishment or whatever it is you're peddling.

[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:16.800]
Okay?

[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:17.800]
That's the way it works.

[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.500]
And part of the salespeople's job, they go out and they get some copy, some commercial copy.

[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.380]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.260]
Commercial copy?

[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:25.960]
Do you get what that is?

[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:26.240]
No.

[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.460]
No, not around here they don't.

[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.080]
And they give us something to work with.

[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.160]
And we come on the air, we dazzle you with bull crap.

[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.400]
And then you say, oh, that sounds great.

[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.240]
And then you go out.

[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.660]
And like last night, we walked into Ruth's Christmas and the rumors.

[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:38.980]
And the very...

[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.540]
I'm not even even set down yet.

[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.700]
There's a guy in his wife sitting there and he looks at me and says,

[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.480]
I want you to know we're here tonight because of you.

[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.280]
How do you like that?

[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.060]
That's what it's all about.

[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.400]
That's the way this business works.

[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.860]
And over the years, if you have some success in doing business for clients,

[00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.540]
which some of us knock on what it had, people want to be on your show.

[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.200]
It's not rocket science, it's not complicated.

[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.360]
But some people want to make it into a big song of dance.

[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.120]
They want to dance with us with their bull crap.

[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:17.120]
And come in here two or three times a week and sit down here next to me and just drive me up the wall.

[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.600]
And keep repeating the same crap over and over and over again and stir up a lot of trouble.

[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.940]
And as soon as George walks out of the room to go take a leak, he's full of crap.

[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.600]
He's full of crap.

[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.460]
He's full of f*** that.

[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:33.280]
About you having to make 7,000 air checks for the colorant account, for example, for this man.

[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.500]
Everything that this man touches is a problem.

[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.200]
Everything he gets involved with is a problem.

[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.560]
He's running up and down the halls, bad-mouthing me.

[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.140]
What is it I'm strange? I'm weird.

[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.200]
That's the word I'm weird.

[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.800]
And George is a compulsive liar.

[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.560]
And everybody, everybody in the human race is outer step except for Todd Dreck and his buddy at his agency.

[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.720]
Oh, he wouldn't want to leave him out.

[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.740]
Let's make sure we make some air checks.

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.240]
Oh, and of course, I'll be getting to my apology for him in a moment.

[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.760]
Not. I'll take that.

[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:02.680]
Yeah, take that.

[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.340]
And while you're at it.

[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.500]
Get up, hurry up.

[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.400]
10 past 10 at 560 WQM.

[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.740]
By the way, anybody see that Atkins piece on TVSC TV News on Friday?

[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.840]
The big expose.

[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.320]
Dan Radler says, we're going to have a big, yeah, three minute piece of f***ing.

[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.860]
I bet you Todd Dreck put that together.

[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:29.040]
10 after 10 at 550 WQM, you're a psychotic neurotic station for the 90s.

[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:29.900]
I don't give a s***.

[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.700]
I don't give a s***.

[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:33.700]

[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.320]
Yeah.

[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.120]
There's a little clinton.

[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.240]
It's just what the tricks and the slions of rape is gonna be.

[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.240]
Definitely, lighter than country.

[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.020]
Lighter than Congress.

[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.800]
The stand that he's wife and his kids.

[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.640]
You know that he did.

[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.380]
All this news is evil.

[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.840]
My dear, they trust that God.

[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.860]
God has gone on empty-done.

[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.700]
The truth is all North God and the North God.

[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:15.760]
Resident Clinton is at the helm because fools close their eyes to the thrine.

[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.020]
Every time I've looked at him and said,

[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.120]
this is the truth, but it's his fate.

[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.280]
It's the truth, it's the truth.

[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.140]
It's the truth, it's the truth.

[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.800]
It's the truth, it's the truth.

[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.160]
It's the truth, it's the truth.

[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:40.940]
The truth is all North God.

[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.060]
All right, that's the thing at 560 WQM got Hank in studio today.

[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.940]
To a clock we got Jim Mad Dog, Mad at you.

[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.820]
Hopefully his checks have cleared by now.

[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.760]
He'll be here at 6 and we got the Marlins and Arizona again.

[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.440]
9.30 tonight.

[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.420]
So anyway, before I get back to that,

[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.860]
here's the male just came, the first piece of male from my good friend Bob Reed,

[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.980]
and HBO workspace.

[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.740]
And he says, do you're Neil, I heard from friends in Miami that you did not enjoy

[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.360]
or HBO special, do you remember 5?

[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.080]
Did I enjoy it?

[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:12.300]
No.

[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.400]
No, it was pretty crappy.

[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.040]
I mean, yeah, some of it was kind of interesting, but number one it was misleading,

[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.640]
because you really got the feeling that she was from the criminal trial,

[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.640]
enough from the civil trial.

[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.060]
And then number two, there were like, it was a 50 minute piece that could have been

[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.700]
on in 20 minutes, because there were like these long,

[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.860]
did you ever write up seeing it?

[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:27.180]
Good.

[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.900]
Because it sucked.

[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.400]
Long pauses and she's sitting there thinking, and oh, ponderous.

[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.400]
He says, I appreciate your opinion, thank you for watching it.

[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.900]
I'm sending you a copy of some of our other work in a previous HBO special,

[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.600]
drop dead gorgeous, maybe you'll enjoy it more regards Bob Reed at HBO.

[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.460]
How do you like that?

[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.720]
So somebody must be listening to the show besides Todd Dreck.

[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.400]
You know, it's, where do you even begin with this place?

[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.980]
Like I said, keep in mind, I don't give a sh-

[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.900]
I don't want to be grasped into one of those shows where at an angry show

[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.760]
where I go into a big, solid dance, it start whining about all the terrible things.

[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.000]
I mean, this is, we learned a long time ago, and it took us a year and a half,

[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.460]
at least for me to finally accept the fact this is not a real business.

[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.660]
This is not a radio station, it's not a Chinese laundry.

[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.740]
This is just, I don't know what it is.

[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.280]
It's a fraternity for Greg and his inner circle, the untouchables,

[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.760]
and the rest of all the stuff that goes on, it's a way of a lot of us making a living.

[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.300]
But other than that, I, all I can say is, I don't know.

[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.400]
I really don't know what it is.

[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.160]
But you know, something like, it started to get to the point where we're having a pretty good time.

[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.140]
Last couple of months when you adopt that attitude, thanks again, Yaldi.

[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.780]
Yeah, you have a much better time when you finally say, okay, we, we, we, we go out.

[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.840]
You've got us, we, we don't, you don't care, we don't care.

[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]
That's a way to do it.

[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.700]
Much less stress, everybody's in a better mood.

[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.500]
And I was thinking to myself when the check showed up a day late last week,

[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.340]
I was thinking, you know, things were going too well.

[00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:58.880]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.520]
Everybody was having too good of a time.

[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.300]
We had that great winner book, the best book in history of this radio station.

[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.760]
Everything was going along a little bit too well.

[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.360]
So needless to say, there had to be some sugars in a wood pile who want to make a mountain out of a molehill and start crises.

[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.340]
And of course, there are those people, I'm sure you people that work out there,

[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.200]
wherever you work, there are one or more people who exist.

[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.760]
Their whole purpose in being there is to stir up all the crap they possibly can.

[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.680]
In our business, they're called professional craft distributors.

[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.540]
Or something that begins with S.H. that sounds like crap distributors.

[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.440]
And they spend their time running around a hall,

[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.640]
stirring up as much hate and as much as the vice of this,

[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.060]
and badmouthing this one and stabbing this one in the back,

[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.900]
and just stirring up a bunch of crap all the time.

[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:46.840]
Crap distributors.

[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:53.760]
Now, I don't know about you, but I mean, it seems to me that I wouldn't have too much time in my life for people like that.

[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.800]
In other words, if they were in my midst, I would want to be getting rid of the gorillas in our midst.

[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.500]
You know?

[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.080]
Now, seriously, look at that picture back up on the wall.

[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.380]
It doesn't look like a gorilla in our midst. I don't know what does.

[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.140]
The picture that our good friend Peter Leonard provided for us, by the way.

[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.280]
But nevertheless, see, I don't want to break the news to you in a subtle way, Todd,

[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.560]
after what you've pulled in here for the second time in about four days.

[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.360]
I don't want to do it subtle. Let me just say this.

[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.840]
Every one that I know in this building hates you like poison.

[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.240]
Now, you think that's an accident? You think maybe George's full of crap at a compulsive liar?

[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.340]
Maybe I'm full of crap?

[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.340]
Here's the guy who I did a spot for two days with an impossible phone number that he and his agency,

[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.060]
but he created all kinds of problems with two spots I ran.

[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.300]
They didn't get any calls the first two days, which is not how they get a lot of calls, by the way.

[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.240]
And a client's very happy even though the agency guy is still...

[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.420]
The Field Roger Show.

[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.160]
Full of crap. That's the wrong button, but nevertheless.

[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.020]
Well, I'm worked up.

[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.880]
My fingers are floating. You're working up to that apology, right?

[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.600]
Yeah, I'll give you an apology, okay?

[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:51.820]
Get up right now.

[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.000]
Like I said, D4, okay?

[00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.200]
What?

[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.360]
Someone's knocking at the door.

[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.540]
Someone's knocking at the door. Maybe Roy came to bring us our black gildo back.

[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.700]
Maybe he hasn't sold it yet on the black market, so to speak.

[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.480]
Maybe he hasn't peddled it yet.

[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.160]
Bootleg.

[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.620]
What is that?

[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.740]
Oh, great. Thank you very much, sir. God bless you.

[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.920]
Neil God. Get a frigid life. Isn't that great? Whatever that means.

[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.540]
So anyway, getting back to this gorilla in our midst.

[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.360]
Here's a sole purpose, I guess, for being here is to create problems.

[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.120]
And all of this started this morning over again for the four million times this month,

[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.900]
wanting George to make an air check of another commercial I'm doing on this show.

[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.140]
In this particular case, I have a piece of copy I won't mention what client it is,

[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.060]
because it would be too embarrassing to everybody concerned.

[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:50.920]
The date, the last time the copy was changed was 11,16,98, seven months ago.

[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.020]
Seven months ago.

[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:01.040]
And by his own admission has he made a copy of the piece of commercial copy in there for these people,

[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:07.220]
which would be very easy as opposed to coming in there and asking you for the 25 million time this week for another god damn tape air check,

[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:13.680]
which they don't even have any cassettes left anymore, because he's caused you to use them all up with the other 45 million air checks.

[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.040]
I'm lying about that, though.

[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.300]
And of course, you're an effort liar. As soon as George goes out to take a leak, he says to me,

[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.380]
George is full of crap.

[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.080]
Todd, I want you to understand right now, we're all full of crap.

[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.360]
The world is out of step. You are the only one who's in line.

[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.900]
The whole world is out of step. Todd directs. He's in step.

[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.840]
You are the most anxious person I have ever worked with in this business 39 years this summer.

[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.020]
That I've been in radio. I've worked with good people.

[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.480]
I worked with marginal people. I worked with nice people, evil people, competent people,

[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.780]
over of course, the 39 years I've worked with a lot of people.

[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.580]
I don't want to see you again. I don't want to know from you. I don't want to see you like I said before.

[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.920]
If you have a copy chain, slip it out of the door.

[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:04.460]
But the idea that any asshole is going to come in here for the second time in just a few days before I go on a year today.

[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.040]
And here in do like a half hour summer.

[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.820]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, and try to get me into a state of frenzy over nothing.

[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.800]
Here you go. Here's the copy. Go into a copying machine that actually works in a hall.

[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.120]
Make a copy. But take it to the client. Revise it. Change it. Add to it. Delete from it.

[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.660]
Do something. That's what you're getting paid for. That's part of your job. Go do it.

[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:30.340]
And stop creating crises. And then he runs out of here after I just lost it.

[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.340]
Lost it. Runs out of here. And runs into Ray Perry like a child. And then go home to mommy and daddy.

[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.220]
Oh, Billy, beat me up at school today.

[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.920]
Runs to a man that we haven't seen in three and a half months.

[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.780]
About anything related to sales was only one of the 25 sales managers here at QIM.

[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.640]
I just stay calm. Keep in mind. I don't give a sh**. That's right.

[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:58.300]
But today I'll make an exception of that. See, they're trying. Like I said, things were going so goddamn well.

[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:05.080]
But because of the very inept management that we got in this place, it just doesn't stay that way for too long.

[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.780]
There have to be people like this just out of control, like whirling durvishes.

[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:14.140]
And nobody seems to be able to control them here because nobody has any authority except for one man.

[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.860]
He's the busy getting a looking for those old pictures of him with his blonde hair.

[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.880]
So that's what he said this morning. He's still getting the pictures doctor to prove that's his real family.

[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.720]
So that's what he's busy doing. And also sitting in there for seven or eight hours,

[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.320]
listening to tapes of the show to see if we're really liars or not.

[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.700]
Like I said, didn't I say this just last week when you work for people and they don't trust your word?

[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.100]
When it's your word against somebody, some crazy person who's running around going,

[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:39.840]
yeah!

[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.640]
And they have to sit and invest seven or eight hours of their time to listen to see if you're a compulsive liar or not.

[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.460]
Then you don't have a very good relationship with the people you're working for.

[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.440]
They don't have a very good grasp on where you've been and what you're all about.

[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.740]
It's tragic. It's pathetic.

[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.080]
I mean, stress kills. The life could be so much.

[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.520]
This is just one little microcosm of life.

[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.860]
It's a good lesson for everybody, okay? Because life is full of crap.

[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:19.680]
Yeah. And it's full of crap because there are people like this who want to create crap or if some doesn't exist.

[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:26.920]
I mean, there's enough real stuff that comes along in life. Problems, illnesses, accidents, horrendous things.

[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.300]
This is part of life. Real things to deal with.

[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:35.720]
And when those things happen, you have to, you know, summon the emotional fortitude and deal with them as best as you can.

[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.940]
But when life should be a pile of roses, okay?

[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.660]
When it should be sweet. When it should be a piece of cake. When everything's going along real great.

[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.780]
Why does anybody have to inject a pile of crap in the middle of it?

[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:50.940]
Is what I would like to know.

[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.140]
And when was just yesterday I was talking about people on short leashes and long leashes.

[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.820]
When does anybody in this building put any of these people on some kind of a leash?

[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.180]
And say, cut the goddamn crap already, okay?

[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:11.620]
I mean, seriously, in the history of this business, I don't think there's ever been any place quite like this one.

[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.200]
Not that I'm complaining, you understand, because like I told you, I don't give a sh-

[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.140]
That's right. That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that's our attitude here.

[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.320]
That's it.

[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.460]
Little soft shoe, we're happy. We're happy campers.

[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.560]
But today we make an exception at least for a little while, maybe only two, three hours,

[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.520]
because I'm fired up and pissed off. I'm psychotic.

[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:31.140]
Psychotic.

[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.640]
Came in here this morning in a great mood.

[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.780]
Feeling sensational. Had a phenomenal meal last night.

[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.040]
One of the best I've ever had in my life. Had the best steak at Ruth's Chris. I've ever had there.

[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.780]
A great ribeye. Oh, man.

[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.940]
And there was mushrooms, the stuffed mushrooms with crab meat.

[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.400]
I never had those before until Saturday when they brought them up for the appetizer, all the stuff that they're assortment.

[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.660]
That is just, I can eat that for the whole meal. That's how good those are.

[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.100]
The mushroom stuffed with crab meat and Ruth's Chris.

[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.240]
So I come in here feeling like on top of the world, and in just about a 45 minute period of time,

[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.420]
instead of feeling like I'm on top of the world, all of a sudden I'm psychotic and feel like, yeah.

[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.700]
Because we got a couple of people in here.

[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.840]
We don't have time for that anymore. We don't play those games anymore.

[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.760]
Go downstairs on a second floor where the sales offices are and play grab ads with each other or with...

[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.040]
Roar!

[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.300]
Whoever you want to play with, okay?

[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.040]
Go play with a big black dildo being held momentarily by...

[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.500]
Roar!

[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.380]
Or however that bit goes. Isn't that how it goes?

[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.940]
A big black dildo in Android.

[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.460]
I mean, that should have been the first tip off that they were coming unglued around here.

[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:40.300]
Is when one of our so-called salespeople, former Dauphin Superstar, walks in here and grabs a big black dildo

[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.700]
and goes racing out of here with it.

[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.660]
I gotta have this.

[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.040]
Who was he doing? I mean, what was he doing with it?

[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.280]
And where is it?

[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.340]
Anybody want to buy any bootleg dildos?

[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.440]
Or in fact, we'll make you two for one deal.

[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.160]
Bootleg Cologne and Dildo throwing in the West to charge.

[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.880]
Greg, I'll tell you, baby, you're some radio guy, man.

[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.680]
You're a real rocket scientist.

[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.680]
27 after 10 at 5, 60 WQM or your salespeople or iceholes.

[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:19.220]
Hello and welcome to Redneck, the ASAP, a collection of fine literary works,

[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:28.140]
has performed by that societal element most likely to consume large quantities of ethanol containing liquids at the ASSIST's wedding.

[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.700]
Which, incidentally, happens to be their wedding as well.

[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:37.280]
Today's presentation is the project tale that is mentioned in the film.

[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:46.940]
Now, in the winter, our decision-tiles, they'd bore you summer by the sun of your...

[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:54.280]
...and all the clouds of the winter to point our house in the day bosom of the ocean bears.

[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.260]
Ah, simply marvelous.

[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:03.020]
Join us next time for another most-beating edition of Redneck Fiat.

[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.380]
1032 at 5, 60 WQM.

[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.840]
By the way, thanks. Who was that, the guy that brought in this license plate?

[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:10.580]
Gary the Simon.

[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.660]
Oh, that was Gary the Simon.

[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.380]
I haven't seen him in so long. I forgot who he was.

[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.080]
He did that reason quite as early as he used to be.

[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.680]
But at any rate, so Gary the Simon brings me a great license tag for the front plate.

[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:26.300]
It says Florida, with a month in a year, and it's big letters, Neil Goddard,

[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.860]
and then between the Neil and the God, it's got a fetus.

[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.200]
It's got a little bubble, a tiny baby on it with a Biblical quarter after round it,

[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.120]
and underneath it says, get a friggin' life.

[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.900]
Ow! How do I get out of this, man?

[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.300]
And you don't look quite as ugly as he used to. How do you like that?

[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.820]
Or am I confusing him with somebody else?

[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.240]
Who I'm confusing him with?

[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.320]
Oh, I don't want to say that. It would be bad to say it on here.

[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.820]
But anyway, moving right along.

[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:47.520]
What?

[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.380]
That's the final call out of my way to insult people, unless they be deserved.

[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.200]
Like Todd Dreck.

[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.360]
And in his case, it wouldn't be an insult, because truth is, you know.

[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.560]
Boy, oh boy, I mean, where did this come from?

[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.700]
Where did this start?

[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.480]
And see the problem with this place is, and didn't I go through a sondant,

[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.880]
like well over a year ago, about a certain water, not tea, you know, up here?

[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.200]
Didn't I go through a sondant about that, and her behavior that I saw down in the apartment lot,

[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.320]
the likes of which I don't think I've ever seen in my life?

[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:23.380]
When you want a business, you can't afford the luxury of letting people be as intolerant to other things,

[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.620]
to each other, they are in this place.

[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.500]
And the problem with this place is nobody is running this ship.

[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.900]
I told you that a year and a half ago.

[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.520]
Now, keep in mind, I don't want you to misunderstand.

[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.920]
I don't give a s**t.

[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.840]
That's right. I mean, I'm not saying that I care about that.

[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.100]
I'm just pointing something out.

[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.360]
That there is nobody in charge.

[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.400]
Nobody's running the ship.

[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.580]
And as a result, we've got all of these people with titles,

[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.360]
all of these people who think they have titles,

[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.920]
all these little whirling dervishes, running out of control,

[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.620]
thinking that they can boss everybody around.

[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.040]
And of course, usually they're bossing the underlings around.

[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.740]
This place is famous for that.

[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.880]
People will want to make their ping as well, even the women, you know,

[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.740]
by bossing around the underlings, board ops, you know,

[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:04.680]
people little, little, little, weasley people, board ops interns, that kind of stuff.

[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.660]
But this crap that I saw here this morning

[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.020]
and the disc goes on and on and on.

[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.220]
You look in the mirror and you wonder, am I losing my mind totally?

[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.860]
Is it possible that there are people like this crawling around on a planet

[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:21.980]
and I do mean crawling around?

[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:29.380]
Who are that compulsive and running my quick creating problems where there aren't any?

[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.300]
Like I said before, there are enough real problems in everybody's life.

[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.960]
Unless you live some idyllic, perfect life, and I've never read anybody who lives that.

[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.580]
Unless you've got the perfect idyllic life, everybody's got real problems.

[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:40.940]
Sooner or later.

[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:46.960]
But to go around manufacturing problems and causing grief and stress and the torus for people,

[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.360]
I'll tell you right now that I do care, okay?

[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.980]
Because that's a polyprop, is what that is.

[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:02.760]
The same guy that was running around in a hallway, Neil is weird, now George is an effing liar

[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.580]
and everybody in the world is an asshole except this guy.

[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.520]
And he's good agency buddies.

[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.680]
By the way, stay tuned for that apology, okay?

[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:12.360]
Yeah.

[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.960]
No, seriously, let's take a mythical figure.

[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:18.880]
Joe Smith, okay?

[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:19.900]
There's a good comedy.

[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:20.680]
Joe Smith.

[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.580]
And you have some kind of Joe Smith creates some kind of a problem in your life.

[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.600]
You haven't even met Joe Smith, but he does something to create a problem.

[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.420]
You talk to 50,000 people and you say, what do you think of Joe Smith?

[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.700]
If 50,000 people all say, he's an asshole.

[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:35.320]
What do you think?

[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.360]
What do you think that means?

[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.500]
I think it probably means he's an asshole.

[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.320]
Yeah, it's not that difficult.

[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.780]
So you can go and create problems if the morning people want to deal with you,

[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.520]
if Hank wants to deal with you, if I doubt or had Kaplan or the people on a weekend,

[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.300]
Mad Dog, Kimba, anybody wants to deal with you, Tom?

[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.680]
Be my guest, okay?

[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.960]
Have a wonderful time, disrupt their lives.

[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.700]
Go in there and give them a big son of a dance.

[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.800]
But I got news for you, stay out of this room.

[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.840]
So that before, only this time, this is the definitive time.

[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.080]
This is the last time.

[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.260]
Don't come into this room.

[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:08.400]
Don't come into the studio.

[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.240]
Don't come into the room or Georgia sitting because he's a compulsive liar.

[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.380]
He don't want to deal with you.

[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.740]
I won't do business with Todd Wreck.

[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.100]
Under any circumstances, I will not speak to him.

[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.140]
I won't have enough and do with him.

[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.240]
And now here's another one.

[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.680]
And like I said before, all the years, I've worked at all these other radio stations,

[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:30.600]
including in this town, K-A-T, W-S-N-Z, I-N-Z, I-O-D, Zeta, all these other stations.

[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:36.500]
I would be hard pressed to tell you anybody that I didn't speak to.

[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.480]
Can you think of anybody from the nine years at I-O-D?

[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.220]
That there was such a hostile relationship that we didn't even speak to them?

[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.980]
High boy used to have the title, but we still spoke to him.

[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.480]
Oh yeah, well, yeah, I mean, he's at least common humor, just from the fat bouncing around, you know?

[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.640]
Just from hearing the stories about all of his exploits, driving everybody else nuts.

[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.340]
Not one person in all those years.

[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:05.920]
And yet here in a year and a half here at WQM, maybe it's just bad luck, or maybe I've turned into a sour old nasty bastard, but I doubt it.

[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:13.800]
Maybe it's just bad luck or coincidence, but look at the growing number of people that you really don't want to be anywhere near.

[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:21.440]
That you don't not only don't want to speak to, you don't want to see them, you don't want to know from them, you don't want to smell them.

[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.580]
You don't even want to hear about them, you don't want to hear their name mentioned God forbid.

[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:35.920]
And don't look at me, mister, because you created this okay by your behavior, by your incessant nagging it.

[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.280]
I mean, if I want nagging, I go to mommy's for lunch, okay?

[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:43.340]
I don't need it from some stranger with a name like Dreckie.

[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.100]
And boy, talk about tooth and packaging.

[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.940]
I'm still apoplectic. This happened like, like I said, from about quarter to nine till nine 25.

[00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.120]
I'm, it's now 10, 40, and I'm still apoplectic.

[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:09.140]
And when's the last time, and all the years you worked on this show that you saw me just go off the deep end and scream and just lose it with anybody like that?

[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.460]
Good con on one hand.

[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.500]
Never, never like this. No.

[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:21.320]
And you wonder why people kill their nagging wives or mothers or whoever at my page, do you want to, you know what I'm saying?

[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.160]
I mean, you can nag somebody to death.

[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:31.520]
It's like taking a spear and stick it in there and just keep twisting it and twisting it and twisting it and probing it and poking it.

[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.640]
And finally they say, get out of here.

[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.160]
And don't come back too soon, okay?

[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:41.520]
Go do the search for that big black dildo that's running around, that's floating around a building.

[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.660]
Go ask Roy if you can borrow it and then...

[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:46.360]
Stick it up for him.

[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:46.840]
Yeah.

[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.940]
I feel better now though.

[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.580]
Not great. I feel better now.

[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.380]
Look at all the people I had to get involved in this.

[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:07.660]
We had Duff involved, we had Screw-N involved, we had Ray Perry involved, we had Greg Reed involved, taking time away from his valuable picture doctrine in the other room.

[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.860]
And the two of us and him, half of the goddamn staff was involved because somebody evidently don't want to do his job.

[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.100]
Service the account, give us some copy, give us some feedback.

[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.320]
Are they getting results of things okay? Are they unhappy?

[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.880]
It's like everybody else does.

[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:28.140]
Like everybody else in the sales department does, but no questions asked, no problem, because that's the way it's done in the business, okay?

[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.000]
That's the way real sales people do it.

[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.860]
Instead of creating your goddamn mini-chrisis over every time somebody...

[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.320]
Don't smell the way you want, okay?

[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:38.860]
Todd?

[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:55.440]
Unchris, unacceptable, vulgar grotesque, puke inducing, subhuman, scumbag, and to make it even worse, he's an asshole, but other than that.

[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.120]
And being full of crap besides.

[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.400]
Twenty before 11 at 560 WQM for over two.

[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.520]
Were you fudge-packing?

[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:11.440]
Ahhhhhhh!

[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:32.140]
When the fog gets flowed over every U.S.Hound, races are still still so many ones red as a monkey fat, and his rain was in his foam.

[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:39.080]
Clayton's got one game, down a secret circuit scene.

[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.120]
We were also joking about that.

[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.440]
Where you talking about China, not on the top.

[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:45.220]
Whoa-oh!

[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.620]
Why did you shut it down?

[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:16.620]
Oh, I'm not a fan of China.

[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:17.480]
I'm not a fan of China.

[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:17.480]

[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:17.480]

[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:17.480]

[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:17.480]

[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:17.480]

[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:17.480]

[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:17.480]

[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.320]
I'm not a fan of China.

[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.000]
Hey, you too, the coward in G.

[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:35.060]
That means I'm not a fan of China.

[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.620]
Infant 465 50 WQM home of the hopeless.

[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.200]
This is a-this is a-it is.

[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:01.240]
So like I said, I don't give a shit, and I feel much better about it.

[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.440]
Anyway, here's our letter to the editor of the day.

[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.260]
This one in the-I should start marking down which paper it is.

[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.360]
I guess this is the hero, and doesn't really make any difference.

[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.340]
No, it's a sun-send-all.

[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:16.640]
And the reason I know it's a sun-send-all is because in the next section in the sun-send-all is morning,

[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:25.760]
I'll find it. I got it. Is the article about the two teens convicted of murder in the Palm Beach?

[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:32.840]
Because the gay, whatever this guy's name was, the inebriated gay guy sitting there to the one of them.

[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:37.780]
You're pretty or beautiful or whatever it is. And right away, gay started beating the crap bottom.

[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.260]
They got his friend and they beat the crap bottom until he was dead and it's said to him and so on.

[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.940]
And so on and so he was going to rape him or something like that. And by the way, he was wrong.

[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.640]
He's not pretty or beautiful. He's a grotesque but nevertheless.

[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:52.180]
So that article is in here and just keep that in mind. So here's a brilliant letter to the editor in the same newspaper this morning.

[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.740]
It says, Hey law cuts both ways and it's signed John Bernanzo in Volker, Bertone.

[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.900]
You know, John, he's an asshole. Yeah.

[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:06.360]
It says, Ray, the article made 12 gay students mom expand US Hey law.

[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.080]
What about laws to protect heterosexuals? Now we're talking.

[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:15.940]
What about the crimes in which homosexuals try to solicit and pursue straight people?

[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.340]
Keep in mind those words solicit and pursue crime. Right. It's a crime.

[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:21.920]
You're all right.

[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:29.480]
While they are going to pass the hate law to protect homosexuals, they should pass a lot of protect victims of solicitations.

[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.160]
Victims of solicitation. I can just see a new national organization.

[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:42.680]
We are victims of solicitations. Thank God that straight guys never try to hit on women who are not interested.

[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.320]
You know, I guess John up there in bulk, I never heard the word no.

[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.800]
No, that's not a little cabiler is the word. No, it is vocabulary. No, I guess not.

[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.800]
Victims of solicitations. Wow.

[00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:04.140]
You know what that reminds me of? It's perfect. The timing is great because I wasn't aware of it and evidently nobody in audience was because nobody in audience saw the piece out of the book.

[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:11.280]
I wanted to see on CBS news about that. Kids that piece of crap. Nobody saw that and evidently nobody over the weekend also saw the thing about our boomer friend up there in Michigan.

[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:20.440]
Which I can't even think of the name of that small town in Michigan begins with an S that I never heard of before with his canoeing incident where he was yelling out the F this and that that and I got to get out of this.

[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:25.220]
F in place. Did you see the outcome guilty? Yeah, the jury said, oh yeah guilty.

[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:35.740]
And keep in mind in Michigan, by the way, 90 days in jail and $100 fine for a cursing first time public cursing same as first time DUI.

[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:41.700]
And first time marijuana position, which of course the cursing partner marijuana neither one should be a crime. Anybody knows that.

[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:48.780]
But the same as first time DUI, which of course DUI is like, you know, maybe you're going to go out there and murder somebody while you're driving under the influence.

[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:55.420]
Oh yeah, 90 days in jail, $100 fine if convicted the same for public cursing for saying the F word in a few other words.

[00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:03.640]
Which he didn't even realize that other people were hearing it, but nevertheless there you go. Let's bring back civility to America, the word police.

[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:18.760]
So I think that's right in line here with the protecting victims of solicitations. And if we're going to have let's let even a sound out John up there in Bokeh.

[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:25.660]
All right, there you go. All those poor women that are getting paud and hit upon and everything else. And you see this kind of crap.

[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:36.620]
This is becoming more and more of the American way where a teacher can't pass a student on the back and say good job, Johnny or Suzie or whatever without right away, sexual harassment assault.

[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.360]
That's what America is becoming.

[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.500]
Thank you.

[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:52.520]
Stanishe Michigan was the town where the Paul Boomer's brother said he said he said and he said and he shouldn't have said it because he got a June 23rd.

[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.180]
The date for sentencing that ought to be interesting.

[00:37:55.700 --> 00:38:05.600]
And they asked the judge what do you think that this is? Do we really have time for this kind of thing? Oh yes. Well, if we have time to, you know, have trials for murderers, we should have time to try these to the crimes do.

[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:16.740]
In Stanishe Michigan, Stanoffish Michigan. You know what I say? Then is what I say. Whatever Paul Boomer said, I say the same back at you.

[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:27.800]
Unbelievable. Victims of solicitations, which he puts in the same line. And by the way, I like to be for I'm not for hate crimes laws. I think the whole concept is stupid.

[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:38.860]
A crime is a crime and whether your victim is black or Jewish or gay or a Spanish. What differences do they make? Punish people for the crimes they commit. Why do we have to have special crimes that the victim happens to be a minority?

[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:48.040]
If we had a criminal justice system that really punish people like for real and speak in a Michigan, by the way, it's interesting to see on the 48 hours last night it was a repeat, which I saw the first time better watch it again.

[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.960]
The guy up in Michigan state that murdered the four girls 20 years ago.

[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.460]
And he was on the verge of getting out.

[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.500]
20 years later, only murdered three or four girls.

[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:09.640]
But he was a Christian. Oh, that's true. He was a good Christian. That's right. He had that real good religious upbringing. I mean, real, very serious religious upbringing. Maybe that's why he was a little bit off center. So to speak.

[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:20.160]
So the same state that can convict somebody for public cursing and threaten 90 days in jail $100 fine. A guy that goes and kills three or four young women in the prime of their lives. He's a four.

[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:24.120]
He killed three and he was on the fourth one day. Oh, that's right when they intervene. Yeah.

[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.700]
Give it to good old and of course, then he tried to kill the kid to the girls. Right.

[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:38.360]
So there's two other four. Try for six. 20 years in jail. And the only because of that shoelace thing that they finally, you know, there was less than there for another 20 years at least maybe 40.

[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:49.840]
On a technicality that they had a conjure up because otherwise they're going to let his ass on the loose. Two murdered four people. But if you're a public cursing in public, then we're going to need your ass because we got time for that kind of crap.

[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.440]
I mean, that's just unbelievable.

[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.540]
And if that isn't enough to raise the thing on your eyebrows.

[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.240]
Our good post personal friend Jose Lampe. I don't want to say that Jose is obsessed.

[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:09.620]
I don't want to say that Jose is like a one pony tune. One tune however that goes.

[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.320]
The Ricky rumor mill in today's the South Florida insider. Ricky Ricky. I mean, this guy just he's probably got a blow up though.

[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:24.540]
He says, there's questions about Miami's hard thrive. Ricky Martin sexuality continue to swirl. Now, let me pause right there. Okay.

[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:33.680]
Can you interject this comment? Are there any questions about Ricky Martin sexuality? If you have one eye, one ear and an IQ larger than your thumbnail, do you have any questions about Ricky Martin sexuality?

[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.980]
No, Jose Lampe is just beaten it to a pulp.

[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:47.280]
As questions about Miami hard thrive Ricky Martin sexuality continue to swirl. The new issue of globe contends that Martin was once molested by Jose Menenda is the left coast music exec.

[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:54.880]
That gun down by a son's Lyle and Eric. The tap features interviews with a tour promoter for Martin's old teeny bopper group Menudo and an LA deputy district attorney.

[00:40:55.220 --> 00:41:02.220]
Both say that during the investigation of the 93 murder police heard that Menenda has spent way too much time with the group and that he molested his favorite Martin on a trip to Disneyland.

[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:08.940]
Martin's LA publicist Kim Jackworth didn't return my calls. Jose who also in the same column this morning, remind me.

[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:16.880]
I told us about that if OJ thinks he's going to move down here, the people in Cocoa Plano ready to make sure he moves out real fast. Nobody wants him here. You know what we're saying?

[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:21.920]
Roar and bring back the goddamn builder. Okay. Jack asked and go sell on account, which would be a first.

[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:32.880]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line of calling. Kendall has been on there for 44 and a half minutes. What does that tell you? Okay.

[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:45.520]
Kendall, hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I've got a van. Neil. These frogs are making me crazy. Uh-huh. I was in Montreal and that molten center that the pitch. Huh?

[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:55.000]
You've been to that. I'm going to Montreal, sir. Oh, don't go. You better off. Yeah. But anyways, uh, I'm also Venezuelan. You love Venezuela. I heard.

[00:41:55.820 --> 00:42:03.900]
No, I don't. I can't stand Venezuela. Oh, but you've been to the wrong place. Yeah. You got to go to Valencia. No, I'm not going back to Venezuela. Oh, you're in a little country.

[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:16.360]
Anyway, anyways, you were talking about Cologne. Huh? Yeah. Yes. You know, my grandpa flew for a Luftwaffe. But Cologne is heard. It's a nice place. It's beautiful. What do you think? What do I think of what?

[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:29.420]
I think that C-Worthaw 3 selling bootleg Cologne right now as we speak. What did I tell you? What did I say in the break there? 44 minutes. This guy held on. Thank you so much. There because at least it was a call, which we got one other one on there right now.

[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:42.640]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line. Hey, listen, it makes no difference to me because like I said before, I don't give a ****. That's right. Call if you want. Don't call if you want to get all the great music cranked up. You could ever want to hear.

[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:59.860]
Like yesterday, it's a damn good thing. I pulled this thing out of my ass with that time magazine pull. Oh, thank God for that. That's the only thing. And by the way, your response is on a scale of zero. I give like a minus infinity, just pathetic, including in order to set the women to 20 women we had except for one or two of nobody had any opinions on this.

[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:07.660]
How, how, how is it possible to be walking around, breathing the fresh or even stale air and not have an opinion on that? Everybody in the country is talking about that.

[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:17.860]
All these things that stir up a lot of conversation everywhere else. Do they stir up anything here? No, don't confuse them. Just like veggie from Boka. It's a vegetative state, baby.

[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:24.500]

[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:23.640]
I.

[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:24.400]
I.

[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:25.700]
I.

[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:27.540]
I.

[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:32.760]
I.

[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:34.280]

[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:36.860]
I.

[02:18:37.780 --> 02:18:40.820]
I.

[02:18:40.820 --> 02:18:42.000]
I.

[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:42.600]

[02:18:42.740 --> 02:18:42.740]

[02:18:43.140 --> 02:18:43.140]

[02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:45.940]

[02:18:46.060 --> 02:18:46.240]
I.

[02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:46.960]
I.

[02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:49.040]
I.

[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:49.440]
�

[02:18:53.740 --> 02:18:54.660]
I.

[02:18:58.320 --> 02:18:58.320]

[02:18:58.320 --> 02:18:58.320]

[02:18:58.360 --> 02:18:58.360]

[02:18:58.820 --> 02:18:58.820]

[02:18:58.900 --> 02:18:58.900]

[02:18:58.900 --> 02:19:02.980]
development of a new software system, which will be year 2000 compliant.

[02:19:03.620 --> 02:19:09.300]
This program is known as millennia year application software system or myAS.

[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:13.540]
Next Monday there will be a meeting in which I will show myAS to everyone.

[02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:18.780]
We will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an opportunity

[02:19:18.780 --> 02:19:20.740]
to get a good look at myAS.

[02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:26.100]
We have not addressed networking aspects yet, so currently only one person at a time can

[02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:26.880]
use myAS.

[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:30.460]
This restriction will be removed after myAS expands.

[02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:34.320]
Last week my secretary said to me, I'm a little nervous.

[02:19:34.740 --> 02:19:36.860]
I never put anything in myAS before.

[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:41.220]
I helped her through the first time and afterwards she admitted that it was relatively

[02:19:41.220 --> 02:19:46.940]
famous and she was actually looking forward to doing it again and was even ready to kiss myAS.

[02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:51.860]
As you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want in myAS.

[02:19:52.540 --> 02:19:58.140]
As myAS grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace for a supervisor to

[02:19:58.140 --> 02:20:02.140]
hand work to an employee and say, here, stick this in myAS.

[02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:07.680]
It will be a great day when we need data quickly and our employees can respond, here it is.

[02:20:08.100 --> 02:20:10.020]
I just pulled it out of myAS.

[02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:15.740]
Okay, 115 at 560 WQM. Hank Goldberg at 2 today is going to be talking about old Cuban

[02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:19.080]
trolls. We got Jim Manage at 6 and then we got the Marlins at 930.

[02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:22.160]
Marlins at Arizona to play the Diamondbacks, Razorbacks,

[02:20:22.720 --> 02:20:25.400]
on your back, whatever it is, no interest.

[02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:29.020]
Here's a lady in the summer, a lady in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:20:30.220 --> 02:20:31.740]
Let's go golf and let's go bowling.

[02:20:31.860 --> 02:20:35.780]
Yeah, like I said, it was none there when you put it around and put it on hold, was it?

[02:20:36.100 --> 02:20:39.360]
It. Yeah, let's go, let's go pick everyone, okay?

[02:20:39.580 --> 02:20:41.820]
Get your finger way up in there deep, Palsy, what you come up with.

[02:20:43.140 --> 02:20:46.540]
Like you were saying just before the old guy has stopped calling once the cops started knocking

[02:20:46.540 --> 02:20:51.800]
on the door. 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:55.120]
It's amazing how these people lose all their courage, you know, they're anonymity behind the phone.

[02:20:55.340 --> 02:20:57.160]
Once certain people start saying, cut the crap.

[02:20:59.060 --> 02:21:00.020]
Here's Marguerite, hello.

[02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:01.700]
So, Neil. Yes, sir.

[02:21:01.900 --> 02:21:04.920]
Yeah, I got a name for your people's Winfluse's Century.

[02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:06.540]
A name I believe the people.

[02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:07.400]
What you're talking about.

[02:21:08.860 --> 02:21:10.360]
The name is Mount St. John.

[02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:12.460]
Yeah.

[02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:18.160]
Influenced 5th Century and a great influence of the next century by making China so powerful.

[02:21:20.020 --> 02:21:22.620]
Yeah, and there you go.

[02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:23.920]
Okay, okay, goodbye.

[02:21:24.100 --> 02:21:26.160]
Okay, do we agree with Mount St. John?

[02:21:27.420 --> 02:21:32.460]
Dung. 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the WDQIM.

[02:21:33.940 --> 02:21:35.540]
North Miami on the speak with Neil.

[02:21:36.140 --> 02:21:37.540]
Okay, let's go to North Miami, hello.

[02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:39.920]
Neil.

[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:40.440]
Yes, sir.

[02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:43.480]
Most influential man, William Gates.

[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:45.060]
Uh-huh, he's on the list.

[02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:46.100]
Huh?

[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:47.360]
I said he's on the list.

[02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:49.000]
He's got to be on the list.

[02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:49.500]
Right behind him.

[02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:50.640]
What would computers be right now?

[02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:51.560]
He's right behind Madonna.

[02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:55.640]
If he'd have been a Schlapp and stated Apple Computer, where would he be today?

[02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:57.660]
So in other words, you don't like the other guy from Apple?

[02:21:57.820 --> 02:21:58.280]
Steve Jobs?

[02:21:58.880 --> 02:21:59.080]
Nah.

[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.400]
He's just riding the curtail of the Bill Gates.

[02:22:03.060 --> 02:22:04.880]
Okay, thank you, sir. Bill Gates can't stand him.

[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:06.000]
Hate that little prick.

[02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:08.220]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, all right.

[02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:09.580]
By the way, Bill, you're a hell of a guy.

[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:10.160]
How about low notes?

[02:22:10.300 --> 02:22:10.960]
Two or three million, huh?

[02:22:11.620 --> 02:22:13.420]
For, you know, just for another 40 or 50 years.

[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:15.020]
What's wrong with that?

[02:22:15.060 --> 02:22:17.080]
By the way, I see in Reek A signed a $40 million

[02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:18.020]
recording contract.

[02:22:18.060 --> 02:22:18.540]
You see that?

[02:22:19.140 --> 02:22:19.700]
40 million.

[02:22:21.460 --> 02:22:23.380]
Now, I think since he's such a big fan of this show,

[02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:24.520]
I think that the Neil Rogers will be

[02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:26.180]
damaged fund two or three million out of that 40.

[02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:27.480]
I think that's a piece of cake.

[02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:28.360]
It's malpateous.

[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:29.560]
I think he might come up with it.

[02:22:30.140 --> 02:22:30.980]
Come on, and Reek A.

[02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:32.860]
Turn it loose and the money too.

[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:34.680]
Here's a North Miami.

[02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:34.980]
Hello.

[02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:36.420]
Hi, Neil. How you doing?

[02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:36.940]
Okay, sir.

[02:22:37.780 --> 02:22:39.960]
I just wanted to, you know, I heard you talking about

[02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:42.540]
about the sugar hidden sugar in foods.

[02:22:42.940 --> 02:22:43.060]
Yes.

[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:45.580]
And I was at a trade show and reminding me of something

[02:22:45.580 --> 02:22:47.000]
that thought you find really interesting.

[02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:49.500]
The trade show was for the supplement industry.

[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.320]
This guy has, one of the guys I met there

[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:54.640]
has a chronicle said, T five, you ever heard of it?

[02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:54.820]
No.

[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:55.880]
It's amazing.

[02:22:56.160 --> 02:22:58.480]
It tastes 100 times sweeter than sugar.

[02:22:59.080 --> 02:23:01.060]
It's taken from a dry flower,

[02:23:01.620 --> 02:23:02.500]
totally natural.

[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:03.000]

[02:23:03.240 --> 02:23:03.440]
Okay.

[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:06.220]
The FDA won't approve it in this country.

[02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:06.740]
Why not?

[02:23:07.540 --> 02:23:09.640]
I guess because the guys who make

[02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:11.440]
Nutra sweeten and the other

[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:13.240]
crud, whatever that stuff is,

[02:23:13.980 --> 02:23:15.440]
you know, are blocking them.

[02:23:16.100 --> 02:23:18.360]
But he says that he can sell it as a supplement,

[02:23:18.700 --> 02:23:19.880]
as a dietary supplement,

[02:23:20.140 --> 02:23:22.460]
but he can't sell it in any kind of a food product.

[02:23:22.700 --> 02:23:22.800]
Huh.

[02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:25.520]
So basically the people are taking it,

[02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:27.360]
opening up the capsule and, you know,

[02:23:27.740 --> 02:23:28.740]
spreading it in our crop.

[02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:29.520]
We're taking it on, yeah.

[02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:30.080]
Yeah.

[02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:30.860]
What is it called?

[02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:31.780]
That Kiva.

[02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:34.600]
All right, just thought of the,

[02:23:34.600 --> 02:23:35.760]
I know because I know you're very

[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:36.360]
knowledgeable in the subject,

[02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:37.520]
maybe you've heard more about it.

[02:23:37.580 --> 02:23:38.080]
I've never heard of it.

[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:39.420]
I mean, it was amazing.

[02:23:39.700 --> 02:23:40.900]
It really tasted sweet.

[02:23:41.300 --> 02:23:41.520]
Okay.

[02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:42.780]
And so I just,

[02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:43.780]
Well, I'm going to tell you one thing.

[02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:47.380]
People who are in the business of selling sugar,

[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:49.380]
hidden products that, you know,

[02:23:49.460 --> 02:23:51.220]
allegedly are sugar free to diabetes.

[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:52.640]
Those people should be in jail.

[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:53.240]
Absolutely.

[02:23:53.800 --> 02:23:54.140]
They might either be-

[02:23:54.140 --> 02:23:55.080]
That's like attempted murder.

[02:23:55.380 --> 02:23:55.640]
Exactly.

[02:23:55.920 --> 02:23:57.000]
They did it to my father once.

[02:23:57.140 --> 02:23:58.260]
Added Jim, believe it or not.

[02:23:58.400 --> 02:23:58.600]
Nice.

[02:23:58.920 --> 02:23:59.080]
Yeah.

[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:00.020]
Okay, thanks for-

[02:24:00.020 --> 02:24:00.500]
I didn't take care.

[02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:00.820]
Okay.

[02:24:01.720 --> 02:24:03.360]
I mean, I don't know about this story.

[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:03.940]
It's in the paper.

[02:24:04.040 --> 02:24:05.240]
I'm not referring to them because I don't know the

[02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:05.920]
worst and the why-

[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:07.180]
Forza and the what's really going on there.

[02:24:07.300 --> 02:24:09.020]
But anybody that's selling stuff that's

[02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:10.580]
killing diabetes or anybody else,

[02:24:10.580 --> 02:24:11.680]
especially someone who's

[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:13.680]
carbohydrate loaded stuff and claiming it's

[02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:14.320]
for diabetes,

[02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:18.720]
that to me is so outrageous and so unbelievable.

[02:24:19.740 --> 02:24:20.820]
And so unacceptable.

[02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:22.380]
But again, your government is busy.

[02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:23.420]
I don't know what they're doing.

[02:24:23.460 --> 02:24:23.820]
Yeah.

[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:25.800]
They're busy looking the other way.

[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:27.140]
They got more important fish to fry.

[02:24:29.900 --> 02:24:30.560]
They're more important.

[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:31.680]
They're worried about some guy

[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:33.100]
cursing in the standish Michigan.

[02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:33.860]
They're worried about that.

[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:36.560]
Public morality.

[02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:37.700]
That's what they're worried about.

[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:39.820]
Here's Pembert Pines.

[02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:40.040]
Hello.

[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:41.780]
I mean, you have a couple of things.

[02:24:42.020 --> 02:24:43.820]
First of all, Henry Ford for your list.

[02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:44.380]
He's-

[02:24:44.380 --> 02:24:44.820]
Let's see.

[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:45.920]
What number is he on here?

[02:24:45.940 --> 02:24:46.480]
He's-

[02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:47.640]
Number 10.

[02:24:48.140 --> 02:24:48.840]
Well, that's pretty good.

[02:24:48.900 --> 02:24:50.380]
Right behind Ronald Reagan, by the way.

[02:24:50.460 --> 02:24:50.900]
What does that say?

[02:24:51.140 --> 02:24:51.300]
Wow.

[02:24:51.740 --> 02:24:52.160]
That's scary.

[02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:54.040]
The other thing is a couple of weeks

[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:55.000]
you're going to talk about the trends

[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:56.920]
and why the stations down.

[02:24:57.120 --> 02:24:57.260]
Yeah.

[02:24:57.360 --> 02:24:58.300]
The answer is Marlins.

[02:24:58.300 --> 02:24:59.600]
I mean, Marlins baseball.

[02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:00.540]
Well, the Marlins are not

[02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:01.600]
between six in the morning

[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:02.400]
and like six at night.

[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:02.880]
So I think-

[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:03.480]
They have some ifs now.

[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:04.640]
You have some ifs now.

[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:05.340]
It was Arbitron.

[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:06.280]
It's got nothing to do with anything.

[02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:07.680]
Our audience is just as gigantic

[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:08.240]
as everyone.

[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:09.260]
And the last thing-

[02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:09.940]
Arbitron again.

[02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:10.320]
They don't know.

[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:11.400]
Ask from my elbow.

[02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:12.260]
That's true.

[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:13.820]
Last thing is I know you read

[02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:14.860]
Dear Believer.

[02:25:14.860 --> 02:25:15.920]
I want to get that website

[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:17.440]
so I can get the information.

[02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:20.960]
www.ffrf.org

[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:22.620]
www.ffrf.org

[02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:23.800]
Thank you.

[02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:24.060]
Okay.

[02:25:24.380 --> 02:25:24.640]
Thanks.

[02:25:24.900 --> 02:25:26.000]
Watch out for the old FF.

[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:29.040]
566705 is not the future farmers of

[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:31.160]
56670560

[02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:31.980]
pound five-

[02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:33.120]
Well, that's what the, uh, you know,

[02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:34.420]
all those dumb glam think.

[02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:35.740]
Oh, the future farmers of America.

[02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:36.940]
The old FFA, huh?

[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:38.940]
Yeah, we got your old FF right over here.

[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:39.480]
Okay, pal.

[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:41.520]
Oh, you got quite-

[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:42.420]
I want to do number two

[02:25:42.420 --> 02:25:44.140]
because it's got 17 question marks on it.

[02:25:44.180 --> 02:25:44.320]
Hello.

[02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:45.200]
Yeah, you don't know.

[02:25:45.300 --> 02:25:45.720]
Okay, sir.

[02:25:45.860 --> 02:25:46.840]
Uh, look at what it's called.

[02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:47.480]
Got to be-

[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:47.820]
What is it?

[02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:49.020]
Okay, that list you're talking about.

[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:49.900]
Who was the top pop again?

[02:25:50.460 --> 02:25:51.580]
The top five.

[02:25:51.940 --> 02:25:53.700]
And the voting as you write this moment.

[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:55.960]
Uh, after the second Elvis Presley.

[02:25:56.100 --> 02:25:57.360]
It's hot rubbeen,

[02:25:57.620 --> 02:25:58.920]
eight-all-fitler, Albert Einstein,

[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:00.680]
and John Paul II,

[02:26:01.140 --> 02:26:01.860]
a little poppa.

[02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:04.340]
Okay, I've got three people to add to that list.

[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:05.660]
Where they might be right.

[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:07.060]
The man with the dressing of being the yes.

[02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:08.980]
Okay, where is Randy West?

[02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:12.320]
Okay, 56670560 pound five-

[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:13.840]
60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:15.100]
Randy West.

[02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:17.200]
I mean, here's the guy that's a number one

[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:18.740]
and Jack Ball call number two.

[02:26:18.740 --> 02:26:19.760]
Don't even have good taste.

[02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:21.260]
Randy West.

[02:26:21.420 --> 02:26:21.480]
The-

[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.740]
He's a Christ, I wouldn't do him with your hand.

[02:26:24.380 --> 02:26:24.760]
Or lips.

[02:26:26.940 --> 02:26:27.980]
56670560 pound five-

[02:26:27.980 --> 02:26:29.700]
60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:30.860]
Get some taste pal.

[02:26:31.740 --> 02:26:32.620]
Well, I'm sure he will.

[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:33.940]
Here's a candle.

[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:34.240]
Hello.

[02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:35.560]
Neil.

[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:37.060]
He said he didn't want to do Randy West

[02:26:37.060 --> 02:26:38.480]
because the candle leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

[02:26:38.580 --> 02:26:38.860]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:39.300]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:39.980 --> 02:26:42.260]
What was your take on what happened this weekend

[02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:44.380]
at the INF at Ted Chrome?

[02:26:45.340 --> 02:26:45.900]
Did you read about that?

[02:26:45.980 --> 02:26:46.500]
No, I did not.

[02:26:46.500 --> 02:26:47.380]
Oh, yeah, they-

[02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:48.160]
I don't read that crap.

[02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:50.680]
They're 17 Cubans revolted.

[02:26:50.900 --> 02:26:51.840]
Yeah, they were revolting.

[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:52.980]
No, they were revolting.

[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:54.000]
We have a lot more than 17

[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:55.200]
you've heard in Cuban than this time.

[02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:57.300]
Most of them hold public office in Dave County, by the way.

[02:26:57.340 --> 02:26:59.320]
No, they were jumping them around to different jails

[02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:00.280]
and they took them back to Chrome

[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:02.020]
and they decided to start masturbating

[02:27:02.020 --> 02:27:03.760]
and throw human feces and stuff.

[02:27:03.820 --> 02:27:04.480]
I got it to you official.

[02:27:04.580 --> 02:27:05.100]
Oh, that's good.

[02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:07.500]
Maybe they saw silence at the lambs one time too many.

[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:08.460]
Okay, thanks for the good news.

[02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:10.520]
It's better than throwing your mouse pads.

[02:27:10.660 --> 02:27:11.140]
I'll tell you that.

[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:12.960]
All you Yankee fans out there cut the crap.

[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:15.300]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:18.040]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:19.300]
Here's Miami.

[02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:19.600]
Hello.

[02:27:20.820 --> 02:27:22.840]
Maybe they're circulating those pictures of

[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:23.720]
the Jody Foster again.

[02:27:23.780 --> 02:27:24.080]
Yes, sir?

[02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:26.480]
Number one, influential person.

[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:28.280]
Number one, best seller.

[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:29.900]
Number one, movie, Howard Stern.

[02:27:30.100 --> 02:27:30.820]
No, okay, great.

[02:27:31.100 --> 02:27:32.040]
In your life, no doubt.

[02:27:32.260 --> 02:27:32.900]
No question about it.

[02:27:32.900 --> 02:27:33.900]
You can tell by the sound of your voice.

[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:35.220]
Here's Dear Field Beach.

[02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:35.440]
Hello.

[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:36.920]
Neil.

[02:27:37.220 --> 02:27:37.540]
Yes, sir.

[02:27:37.580 --> 02:27:38.100]
When it's started.

[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:39.080]
And back to you.

[02:27:39.420 --> 02:27:41.400]
Hey, I can't believe nobody's mentioned it,

[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:43.440]
but it's very obvious that too

[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:45.060]
most important people of century.

[02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:47.540]
It's going to be the water Nazi.

[02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:51.920]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT.

[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:53.860]
A little amateur comedians now are back.

[02:27:54.260 --> 02:27:54.640]
They're back.

[02:27:55.140 --> 02:27:56.320]
They got a lot of time on their hands.

[02:27:56.440 --> 02:27:57.680]
They got something on their hands anyway.

[02:27:57.800 --> 02:27:59.080]
I think that guy was just talking about it.

[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:03.980]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:28:04.260 --> 02:28:06.120]
A town with no material, boys and girls,

[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:06.860]
ladies and gentlemen.

[02:28:07.140 --> 02:28:08.520]
A town that is a vacuum.

[02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:10.700]
Four million people and it's a vacuum.

[02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:13.800]
Has been for the last 100 years and always will be.

[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:15.980]
No matter what's going on,

[02:28:15.980 --> 02:28:17.700]
it could be dropping nuclear weapons on God,

[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:18.640]
then cut the ridge.

[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:20.760]
And these people are still doing their...

[02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:22.820]
Stuff.

[02:28:23.180 --> 02:28:23.760]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:24.700]
Eeeh!

[02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:25.640]
Yeah, that too.

[02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:27.240]
Here's Miami.

[02:28:27.340 --> 02:28:27.540]
Hello.

[02:28:28.060 --> 02:28:28.340]
Hey, Neil.

[02:28:28.420 --> 02:28:29.720]
It's almost sounds like the lightning around here.

[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:30.140]
Almost.

[02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:32.360]
Well, what do you want when they got no material?

[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:33.420]
They have nothing to talk about.

[02:28:33.580 --> 02:28:35.800]
I mentioned the thing on CBS News about the AT&T.

[02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:37.140]
They got nothing to say about that.

[02:28:37.340 --> 02:28:38.160]
About the riddle and thing.

[02:28:38.300 --> 02:28:39.260]
They got nothing to say about that.

[02:28:39.260 --> 02:28:44.220]
About the guy that says we ought to have the solicitation police.

[02:28:44.620 --> 02:28:45.240]
All this other stuff.

[02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:47.640]
They got no ideas, no thoughts about any of these things.

[02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:50.340]
All they know is that Spike Lee was the most important person of our century.

[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:51.080]
This is South Florida.

[02:28:51.340 --> 02:28:52.200]
Oh my God.

[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:53.880]
So about a bunch of vacuum brains.

[02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:56.540]
Before I get to the truth of M419 people I think in the century,

[02:28:56.540 --> 02:28:57.240]
I just want to tell you,

[02:28:57.540 --> 02:28:58.800]
you've got to get over to New York Prime,

[02:28:58.940 --> 02:28:59.040]
Neil.

[02:28:59.120 --> 02:28:59.940]
This is the best day in the world.

[02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:00.940]
One of the best in the world.

[02:29:01.020 --> 02:29:02.140]
I'm not going all the way up the boat.

[02:29:02.280 --> 02:29:02.780]
You've got to get out.

[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:03.000]
You're going to...

[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:03.900]
I'm not going to go.

[02:29:04.060 --> 02:29:04.980]
I'm not going to bokeh.

[02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:06.580]
Did you talk about roots like it's God?

[02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:08.100]
If you eat in New York Prime,

[02:29:08.100 --> 02:29:09.500]
you'll never go back to root crisp.

[02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:09.880]
Sure.

[02:29:10.060 --> 02:29:12.480]
I wouldn't go to bokeh if they paid me by the minute.

[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:13.820]
I'm telling you, you're missing a meal.

[02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:14.560]
You're not going to forget.

[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:15.160]
Uh-huh.

[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:16.240]
If you have any minutes of dinner,

[02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:17.220]
they're going to tell you it's the best day.

[02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:17.540]
Did they ever go?

[02:29:17.540 --> 02:29:19.700]
I had a couple of calls when we did that show,

[02:29:19.780 --> 02:29:20.440]
saying it was great.

[02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:22.060]
One call said it was enough.

[02:29:22.220 --> 02:29:23.480]
Well, they don't know because it...

[02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:25.020]
I'm very happy with roots crisp.

[02:29:25.220 --> 02:29:26.320]
I have no problem with their steak.

[02:29:26.460 --> 02:29:27.440]
I had a mistake last night.

[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:28.260]
I've ever had my life.

[02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:30.940]
Except for the fact they didn't even office a cappuccino random,

[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:32.900]
which I thought was really chinchy on their part.

[02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:33.860]
I was really pissed off.

[02:29:33.880 --> 02:29:34.740]
I'm not against it either.

[02:29:34.740 --> 02:29:35.640]
It's just one two three three.

[02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:36.360]
You're going to post that.

[02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:36.400]

[02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:36.960]
Let me say...

[02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:38.320]
How many times do I have to say it to you?

[02:29:38.420 --> 02:29:39.180]
I live in plantation.

[02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:40.600]
It's long enough for me.

[02:29:40.740 --> 02:29:42.500]
It takes me a little half an hour

[02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:43.400]
to get to root crisp.

[02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:44.660]
Torture is driving out.

[02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:45.320]
It's otherwise boulevard.

[02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:47.780]
I'm sure it's not slipping all the way to bokeh to get a meal.

[02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:48.960]
I get you a limo quarter of that.

[02:29:48.980 --> 02:29:49.340]
No thing.

[02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:50.800]
Anyway, the two most influential people

[02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:52.120]
are PP and half from home.

[02:29:52.260 --> 02:29:52.840]
Okay, great.

[02:29:53.620 --> 02:29:54.620]
See, every time,

[02:29:54.740 --> 02:29:55.800]
another jackass,

[02:29:56.180 --> 02:29:56.580]
another idiot.

[02:29:58.040 --> 02:29:59.900]
And I'm going to slip up the bokeh for a goddamn steak.

[02:30:00.020 --> 02:30:00.840]
I'm going to tell you something.

[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:02.420]
So many of you, including this guy,

[02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:03.780]
your taste is deep inside your...

[02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:05.420]
Somewhere around town.

[02:30:05.960 --> 02:30:07.000]
Just ask my good friend,

[02:30:07.180 --> 02:30:07.380]
Roy!

[02:30:07.880 --> 02:30:09.920]
Okay, maybe that's what he's probing for with that instrument.

[02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:11.100]
He took out of here on Friday

[02:30:11.100 --> 02:30:12.180]
and still hasn't brought back.

[02:30:14.020 --> 02:30:15.420]
I still don't understand that

[02:30:15.420 --> 02:30:17.760]
only in this radio station could something like that go on.

[02:30:18.220 --> 02:30:19.620]
Or somebody comes barging in here

[02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:20.840]
like we owe him something,

[02:30:21.060 --> 02:30:22.060]
like we owe him cigars

[02:30:22.060 --> 02:30:23.380]
that we have a very limited number of them

[02:30:23.380 --> 02:30:24.420]
here from our good friend Nick's

[02:30:24.420 --> 02:30:25.140]
because they, you know,

[02:30:25.980 --> 02:30:26.600]
are tight.

[02:30:27.880 --> 02:30:28.260]
Oh, seriously,

[02:30:28.460 --> 02:30:29.260]
what is that all about?

[02:30:29.380 --> 02:30:30.500]
That we owe him something

[02:30:30.500 --> 02:30:32.480]
for all the stress and grief he gave us

[02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:33.160]
trying to get his buddy,

[02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:34.600]
OJ Howard on this radio station

[02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:35.700]
so we owe him something.

[02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:38.880]
And the fact that oh, by the just thought on me,

[02:30:39.700 --> 02:30:41.060]
OJ was on that,

[02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:44.360]
will he sims the thing this morning on MBM?

[02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:46.300]
So he must be in town again,

[02:30:46.380 --> 02:30:46.840]
looking around.

[02:30:47.260 --> 02:30:49.200]
So maybe that's where that big black builder was, huh?

[02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:52.900]
Yeah, ever since...

[02:30:52.900 --> 02:30:53.160]
Roy!

[02:30:53.540 --> 02:30:53.960]
Gotta hold it.

[02:30:54.060 --> 02:30:55.460]
We'll just take a pull up...

[02:30:55.460 --> 02:30:56.560]
That'll be the pull question.

[02:30:56.700 --> 02:30:56.940]
Who's...

[02:30:56.940 --> 02:30:57.300]
Back to him.

[02:30:57.380 --> 02:30:57.700]
Is it in?

[02:30:59.360 --> 02:30:59.720]
Yeah.

[02:31:01.140 --> 02:31:02.440]
I mean, I know there were butt buddies,

[02:31:02.440 --> 02:31:04.820]
but Jesus Christ talking about literally...

[02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:06.720]
126 at 560 QAM.

[02:31:06.800 --> 02:31:07.220]
Deal!

[02:31:07.620 --> 02:31:08.260]
F*** you!

[02:31:13.720 --> 02:31:15.540]
I made it to a farm,

[02:31:15.540 --> 02:31:16.400]
so I care

[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:20.440]
somehow I made it to...

[02:31:22.360 --> 02:31:25.400]
You know how evil I was

[02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:27.980]
till I watched the runnyzoo

[02:31:29.560 --> 02:31:30.720]
They say we're

[02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:32.620]
all gonna be

[02:31:33.520 --> 02:31:34.640]
when I'm mad

[02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:36.460]
when I'm mad

[02:31:36.460 --> 02:31:37.520]
I'm cruel

[02:31:37.520 --> 02:31:39.700]
but you make us feel

[02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:44.560]
Yeah, you make us feel

[02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:47.120]
like we're still through

[02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:51.560]
and like a soothing air

[02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:56.360]
from the 86 times

[02:31:57.640 --> 02:32:00.400]
Like a soothing air

[02:32:01.520 --> 02:32:03.640]
when you're farm farm

[02:32:03.640 --> 02:32:05.500]
in the chino side

[02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:07.340]
Like a soothing air

[02:32:09.160 --> 02:32:10.300]
Ooh, yeah, just,

[02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:12.020]
Welcome to the perfect

[02:32:12.020 --> 02:32:13.460]
possible way to talk to others.

[02:32:13.460 --> 02:32:14.660]
There's anybody here from out of town

[02:32:14.660 --> 02:32:15.920]
and we have one question, okay?

[02:32:16.020 --> 02:32:17.280]
If you're here visiting from out of town,

[02:32:17.400 --> 02:32:18.640]
all we wanna know is...

[02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:19.080]
Why?

[02:32:20.420 --> 02:32:22.240]
132 at 560 WQM.

[02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:23.180]
Hank Goldberg is in the building.

[02:32:23.180 --> 02:32:24.020]
He'll be here at 2 o'clock.

[02:32:24.100 --> 02:32:24.680]
We got you in managed.

[02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:25.660]
Come along at 6.

[02:32:26.360 --> 02:32:27.800]
Come along at 6, like I said.

[02:32:27.940 --> 02:32:28.140]
Yeah!

[02:32:28.460 --> 02:32:29.180]
And then Marlon baseball

[02:32:29.180 --> 02:32:30.380]
939 pregame.

[02:32:30.860 --> 02:32:32.100]
Marlon's at the West Coast.

[02:32:32.900 --> 02:32:33.920]
And they're smoking, baby.

[02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:35.080]
They lost another one last night.

[02:32:35.240 --> 02:32:36.160]
Three out of four to the Yankees.

[02:32:36.400 --> 02:32:37.740]
So that's 7-game winning streak.

[02:32:37.740 --> 02:32:38.300]
It was like

[02:32:38.840 --> 02:32:39.740]
Yeah, flashing the pan.

[02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:42.460]
560 705 60 pound 560

[02:32:42.460 --> 02:32:44.040]
on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:32:44.200 --> 02:32:45.120]
Our poll today, the most

[02:32:45.120 --> 02:32:46.760]
insipid person of the 20th century.

[02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:48.820]
Here's Miami.

[02:32:48.980 --> 02:32:49.140]
Hello.

[02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:50.600]
Yeah.

[02:32:50.800 --> 02:32:51.140]
Yes, sir.

[02:32:51.340 --> 02:32:52.700]
For the literary set,

[02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:53.940]
gov it off.

[02:32:54.280 --> 02:32:54.480]
Yeah.

[02:32:54.820 --> 02:32:55.420]
And for music,

[02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:57.400]
and 200 years from now,

[02:32:57.540 --> 02:32:59.760]
Hendrix will go down as the most art of our century.

[02:33:00.060 --> 02:33:01.980]
Yeah, the best that did the schmarts of our century.

[02:33:02.140 --> 02:33:02.300]
Okay.

[02:33:02.820 --> 02:33:06.120]
560 705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:33:06.520 --> 02:33:07.840]
Well, he sure did the best drugs, baby.

[02:33:08.180 --> 02:33:10.640]
Okay, that's going to be our poll question tomorrow.

[02:33:10.780 --> 02:33:11.480]
Who did the best drugs?

[02:33:11.620 --> 02:33:12.640]
What's your name?

[02:33:13.060 --> 02:33:14.240]
Can't even think of her name right now.

[02:33:15.060 --> 02:33:16.240]
That died at the age of 28,

[02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:17.240]
with that awful voice.

[02:33:17.420 --> 02:33:18.700]
I can't believe I can't think of her name.

[02:33:18.700 --> 02:33:18.900]
Dennis Joplin.

[02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:19.660]
Janice Joplin.

[02:33:20.340 --> 02:33:21.940]
I have a mental block on Janice Joplin.

[02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:22.700]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:33:23.400 --> 02:33:24.300]
Oh, that brings it back here.

[02:33:25.100 --> 02:33:26.440]
Janice Joplin and Jimmie Hendrix,

[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:28.000]
or the best booze, Jim Morrison.

[02:33:29.420 --> 02:33:30.980]
I think he drank like French wines.

[02:33:31.180 --> 02:33:31.540]
Fine wines.

[02:33:31.660 --> 02:33:32.760]
That's why he disappeared in France.

[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:33.540]
They buried him over there.

[02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:35.300]
So maybe that's that bad smell over there.

[02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:37.760]
Here's a mobile in Delray.

[02:33:37.940 --> 02:33:38.020]
Hello.

[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:39.700]
Yeah, hello, Neil.

[02:33:39.860 --> 02:33:40.180]
Yes, sir.

[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:42.080]
Yeah, I would say it would be Thomas Edison.

[02:33:42.140 --> 02:33:42.960]
Where's he in the list?

[02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:44.280]
Where's he in the list?

[02:33:44.860 --> 02:33:47.400]
He has the number 20.

[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:48.380]
Right behind.

[02:33:48.460 --> 02:33:49.940]
Right behind Princess Diana.

[02:33:49.940 --> 02:33:50.720]
How do you like that?

[02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:51.720]
It's unbelievable.

[02:33:52.520 --> 02:33:54.120]
Hey, but I want to bust your premise,

[02:33:54.320 --> 02:33:55.560]
but I want to leave half your ass and hide

[02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:57.120]
any other half and one step to your bag.

[02:33:57.360 --> 02:33:58.020]
Okay, thanks.

[02:33:59.980 --> 02:34:01.820]
5670560, 0560 on the AT&T line.

[02:34:02.980 --> 02:34:03.760]
Here's Miami Lake.

[02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:04.080]
Hello.

[02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:05.200]
Hi, Neil.

[02:34:05.420 --> 02:34:05.680]
Yes, sir.

[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:06.160]
How are you, sir?

[02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:06.560]
Great.

[02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:06.980]
Good.

[02:34:07.260 --> 02:34:09.840]
I wanted to put it in my suggestions for the list.

[02:34:10.060 --> 02:34:11.780]
Are we going to be doing this all summer long?

[02:34:11.780 --> 02:34:12.560]
I was only joking.

[02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:13.180]
Go ahead, sir.

[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:15.260]
So I guess it's better than nothing.

[02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:16.780]
But I just had to use the measures mentioned,

[02:34:17.100 --> 02:34:17.680]
Janice Joplin.

[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:17.940]
Yes.

[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:18.980]
Did you know number one?

[02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:20.900]
Did you know he's dated Bill Bennett?

[02:34:21.780 --> 02:34:22.500]
In college.

[02:34:22.740 --> 02:34:23.320]
Bill Bennett?

[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:25.720]
Do you mean the right wing fanatic or lunatic?

[02:34:25.980 --> 02:34:26.940]
What's wrong with everybody else?

[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:27.680]
And I'm so goody.

[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:28.500]
Two shoes, Bill Bennett.

[02:34:28.580 --> 02:34:30.680]
And in high school, guess who's who she was in high school with?

[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:32.260]
Jimmy, Jimmy Johnson.

[02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:34.440]
Jimmy Johnson?

[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:34.840]
Yes.

[02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:36.780]
I'm going to be doing that.

[02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:36.980]
Jimmy Joplin?

[02:34:37.300 --> 02:34:37.500]
Yes.

[02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:38.220]
Not possible.

[02:34:38.300 --> 02:34:38.480]
Yes.

[02:34:39.020 --> 02:34:39.360]
It is?

[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:40.240]
It wouldn't have been a thank-yes.

[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:40.900]
Okay.

[02:34:41.100 --> 02:34:42.600]
And in terms of the list,

[02:34:42.780 --> 02:34:43.080]
I think we're going to have to go.

[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:44.380]
Where's Henry Ford on the list?

[02:34:44.540 --> 02:34:46.100]
Henry Ford is up there.

[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:47.560]
He's number 10.

[02:34:47.820 --> 02:34:48.580]
Okay, love you, Neil.

[02:34:48.620 --> 02:34:49.760]
He's right behind Ronald Reagan.

[02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:50.620]
Okay, love you.

[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:51.960]
And right ahead of John Lennon,

[02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:54.380]
he's sandwiched in between too much to do about nothings.

[02:34:55.300 --> 02:34:56.740]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:34:56.880 --> 02:34:59.640]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless, whatever it is.

[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:01.000]
Here's mobile and four-loader deal.

[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:01.220]
Hello.

[02:35:01.780 --> 02:35:03.600]
Gee, where's you came up with as well?

[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:06.860]
I've actually got a couple of really good nominees for the list.

[02:35:06.980 --> 02:35:07.960]
What do you mean who came up with it?

[02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:09.200]
The readers of Time Magazine,

[02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:10.340]
all these pseudo-unlectuals

[02:35:10.340 --> 02:35:11.740]
with their little personal computers.

[02:35:11.740 --> 02:35:12.240]
Through that.

[02:35:12.660 --> 02:35:14.020]
In emphasis on pseudo.

[02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:16.300]
Now I'm going to have to go.

[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:18.880]
How pseudo-Canadae when Elvis is number one, sir?

[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:21.560]
I think pseudo-humanism might be the term for him.

[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:22.260]
Gee, with.

[02:35:22.820 --> 02:35:23.880]
We'll go and logo right.

[02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:24.520]
Yeah, okay.

[02:35:24.700 --> 02:35:25.100]
That's all.

[02:35:25.300 --> 02:35:25.440]
Hold.

[02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:27.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, I-

[02:35:27.340 --> 02:35:28.560]
Listen, if that's all you got,

[02:35:28.660 --> 02:35:30.200]
it's some stupid name you want to blur it out.

[02:35:30.380 --> 02:35:31.360]
Save it for a rainy day.

[02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:32.580]
Okay, it's not raining right now.

[02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:33.820]
I don't think even though we don't have a window.

[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:34.480]
Save it.

[02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:36.320]
It is so terminal, so ponderous.

[02:35:36.440 --> 02:35:37.760]
It's putting me into a coma.

[02:35:38.180 --> 02:35:38.480]
Coma.

[02:35:38.940 --> 02:35:40.500]
Deep, deep, long sleep.

[02:35:40.780 --> 02:35:43.220]
I'm going to change my name to Rip Van Winkle with this crap.

[02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:43.600]
Okay?

[02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:46.100]
Oh, Jesus.

[02:35:46.340 --> 02:35:48.080]
Time Magazine should only die.

[02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:50.680]
The editors of Time Magazine should have a gigantic popping

[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:51.960]
a roid right now from this.

[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:54.100]
It was great to kill four hours yesterday,

[02:35:54.180 --> 02:35:55.580]
even though it got real ponderous,

[02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:57.560]
especially because of the really bad choices.

[02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:00.420]
And then we get today that very articulately up there

[02:36:00.420 --> 02:36:03.280]
in Fort Pierce, which spikedly, see, she said in the back,

[02:36:03.420 --> 02:36:04.940]
the young 18-year-old lady from Hylia,

[02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:06.280]
that was a breath of fresh air.

[02:36:07.140 --> 02:36:07.900]
That was great.

[02:36:08.460 --> 02:36:12.120]
But that bitch, the one up there in Fort Myers would have,

[02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:12.680]
or whatever, if it were,

[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:13.520]
if it were, if it had some Fort,

[02:36:13.820 --> 02:36:14.500]
Fort Dix.

[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:16.320]
God almighty.

[02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:18.760]
What a pile of crap spike.

[02:36:18.940 --> 02:36:19.860]
And she was serious.

[02:36:20.100 --> 02:36:21.020]
That's the best part.

[02:36:21.220 --> 02:36:21.420]
Okay?

[02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:22.380]
Love these bozos.

[02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:23.760]
They think this is their opportunity to be

[02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:25.020]
like that half from homestead,

[02:36:25.140 --> 02:36:26.520]
who should only pop one too, okay?

[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:26.980]
You idiot.

[02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:30.260]
But good.

[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:31.260]
God almighty.

[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:33.540]
Spike Lee and uh, uh,

[02:36:33.860 --> 02:36:35.520]
oh, Steven Spielberg.

[02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:39.100]
Jesus Christ.

[02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:42.480]
Talk about brains that have just vanished,

[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:43.400]
that have disappeared.

[02:36:43.620 --> 02:36:44.620]
And you don't believe in evolution?

[02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:48.460]
Just look inside between the ears of your average American out there.

[02:36:48.780 --> 02:36:49.580]
There ain't nothing in there.

[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:52.580]
Even in a raguist spaghetti sauce, it's in there,

[02:36:52.660 --> 02:36:53.820]
but not in between your ears.

[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:54.620]
It's a vacuum.

[02:36:56.780 --> 02:36:57.440]
Here's Miami.

[02:36:57.540 --> 02:36:57.740]
Hello.

[02:36:58.660 --> 02:37:01.220]
Even a hover people never invented a vacuum like this.

[02:37:01.300 --> 02:37:01.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:04.180]
Yeah, I'm going to Toronto this weekend.

[02:37:04.620 --> 02:37:09.020]
I'm just like to know your feedback on exactly what things I should be seen,

[02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:10.540]
or a point of view of interest.

[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:11.120]
Okay.

[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:12.780]
Point of view of interest.

[02:37:12.780 --> 02:37:15.100]
They got a great Tim Hortons on Young Street.

[02:37:15.860 --> 02:37:16.260]
Yeah.

[02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:16.840]
Yeah.

[02:37:17.260 --> 02:37:21.900]
And any, any delicacies that you should be looking for?

[02:37:22.380 --> 02:37:23.260]
Any delicacies?

[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:23.660]
Yeah.

[02:37:23.860 --> 02:37:24.220]
Like what?

[02:37:24.340 --> 02:37:24.960]
Like smoked meat?

[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:25.920]
Whatever.

[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:26.580]
Yeah.

[02:37:26.900 --> 02:37:27.860]
Check out the smoked meat.

[02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:28.460]
Yeah.

[02:37:29.860 --> 02:37:30.360]
All right.

[02:37:30.420 --> 02:37:30.520]
Good.

[02:37:30.660 --> 02:37:30.840]
Thank you.

[02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:31.820]
What are you going there for?

[02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:32.960]
Uh, well,

[02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:38.340]

[02:37:38.340 --> 02:37:38.980]

I'll be in the next couple of weeks.

[02:37:40.820 --> 02:37:42.000]
Are you going there for a reason?

[02:37:42.180 --> 02:37:44.520]
Are you just going there to get away from here, which is always a good way?

[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:45.200]
You got it.

[02:37:45.360 --> 02:37:45.540]
Okay.

[02:37:45.620 --> 02:37:46.120]
Have a good time.

[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:46.760]
You'll love it.

[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:47.000]
Okay.

[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:48.160]
There you go.

[02:37:48.220 --> 02:37:49.020]
There's an honest guy.

[02:37:49.340 --> 02:37:50.160]
I'm out of here.

[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:52.400]
Oh God bless you, sir.

[02:37:52.540 --> 02:37:53.400]
I can't say that I blame you.

[02:37:53.500 --> 02:37:54.640]
Oh, if you don't like it here, yeah.

[02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:55.520]
Blow out your ass.

[02:37:56.940 --> 02:37:57.840]
I'm not going anywhere.

[02:37:58.020 --> 02:37:58.120]
Okay.

[02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:00.980]
I'm staying here just enough to keep those paychecks coming.

[02:38:01.940 --> 02:38:03.460]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:05.340]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T Ruala.

[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:08.540]
And don't forget the Burger King up there like right close to the Sutton Place, you know?

[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:09.420]
I'm Young Street.

[02:38:10.820 --> 02:38:13.840]
And then of course there's the great subway stop on a corner of Blur and Young where you can go

[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:16.560]
north and south and east and west and never the twain show me.

[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:17.280]
I don't know.

[02:38:17.540 --> 02:38:18.320]
I don't know what to tell you.

[02:38:18.620 --> 02:38:19.180]
Just have a great time.

[02:38:19.260 --> 02:38:21.600]
Just walk outside and see all the living and breathing people.

[02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:24.300]
Go to the hockey hall of fame and drop your kids off there because you'll hate it.

[02:38:25.780 --> 02:38:26.420]
It's for kids.

[02:38:26.540 --> 02:38:27.380]
It's a place for kids.

[02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:29.260]
It's a place for people at just, you know,

[02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:32.380]
over the age of three, you won't like it too much.

[02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:35.360]
22 before 2 at 5, 60, WQM.

[02:38:35.420 --> 02:38:40.700]
You're the biggest pile of force crap I have ever seen in my freaking fracking life.

[02:38:41.620 --> 02:38:44.020]
Yes.

[02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:44.020]

[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:57.960]
I'm dreaming of a white neighbor just like one that I just know.

[02:38:59.940 --> 02:39:06.560]
Where the longings were trimmed and cars had rings.

[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:10.920]
So where do you think it was so very long ago?

[02:39:14.460 --> 02:39:19.880]
I'm dreaming of a white neighbor.

[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:20.960]
All right.

[02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:25.140]
With every force he'll sign on your body.

[02:39:26.060 --> 02:39:26.320]
Yeah.

[02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:33.260]
Your days be merry and bright.
