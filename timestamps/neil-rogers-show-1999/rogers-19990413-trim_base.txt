[00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.920]
Sport Radio 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Roger Show.

[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.200]
To talk to Neil called 567-0560 toll report, 8 to arred, or pound 560 on your cell.

[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.240]
Or the opinions of Neil, his guests, callers, or anyone else on the show

[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.720]
do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM, easily read acquisitions, or the Beasley broadcast.

[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.420]
Okay, now Neil Rogers on Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.560]
Oh, Neil, my queen.

[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.100]
Go!

[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.800]
How I love the liquor, clippin' that is why I become a singing lesbian nun.

[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.720]
Mr. Mary Cassarren was so impressed with what I done.

[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.760]
He gave me action with her son.

[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.580]
Oh!

[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.720]
And you can see, for say, family, that's just some whence number one.

[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.480]
Because I was a nun.

[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.140]
Yes.

[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.920]
Found a way to make some cash and hope the royal people left because retired nuns don't get nuns.

[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.400]
I never made it that big because I didn't look that great.

[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.560]
So I got the un-new habit to win drugs and getting laid.

[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.240]
Had my wand and only hitches and a bat again got hit, the Pope said, there's my big.

[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.240]
Now that I'm dead, I can't reveal how much I wanted Sally's heel.

[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.220]
You go whistling in my wee, Neil.

[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.220]
Now, why do you hate that man so much?

[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.280]
Why would you do that?

[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.440]
I mean, I already had remembered that, even my age, my old, speaking of drugs, by the way,

[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.560]
I don't want to talk about that yet.

[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.160]
So let me forget to talk about that.

[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.760]
I had a bizarre, I had a weird, I had a strange experience yesterday.

[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.120]
Woo!

[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.060]
I mean, well, we'll get to it.

[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.680]
So George comes in here rushing in here.

[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.820]
Why do you hate rumors so much?

[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.620]
Why do you despise him so much?

[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.900]
You asked me to remind you to say that.

[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.800]
No, that's not the question.

[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.700]
I understand why what this says.

[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.360]
But why do you despise him so intensely?

[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.880]
For the same reason that most other people do is that what it is?

[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.540]
Sure, yeah.

[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.340]
No, no, seriously.

[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.440]
Why do you hate the man?

[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.360]
He's cheap.

[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.240]
He's arrogant, with a cause, and he stiff me on the odd dinner that he promised.

[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.900]
Got me some crappy seats at the air-counter this center, I'll tell you that.

[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.660]
Really, really bad seats.

[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.220]
His wife is a wonderful...

[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.140]
His wife is a sweetheart.

[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.360]
That's the only reason I have...

[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.500]
Like you were asking me the other day.

[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.700]
Why everybody asks you?

[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.420]
Why doesn't he associate with Jeff Rimmer?

[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.040]
Because his wife is a sweetheart.

[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.840]
I love his wife.

[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.080]
Seriously.

[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.840]
He's one of the nicest people I've ever known in my life.

[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.580]
She's a mention.

[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.240]
Why?

[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.300]
Whatever that means.

[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.400]
But he is what he is.

[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.160]
He can't help it.

[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.420]
He just is what he is.

[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.480]
But he got me really crappy seats with...

[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.680]
We could use some binoculars in there.

[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.620]
I will come back, by the way, because toward the end of the show yesterday,

[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.900]
which we were abbreviated, because of that wonderful Marlon game yesterday,

[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.920]
nice going, hey, Ed, you think Leavon come in two games this year?

[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.180]
No.

[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.920]
I don't think so.

[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.940]
Just toward the end of that show, when we find to get a little bit of response,

[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.400]
absolutely incorrect.

[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.860]
You jackasses that were calling in their toward the end.

[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.020]
Well, you're always bitching out people to them.

[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.360]
I've never said that people don't chew up at the Macarena.

[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.140]
In fact, all you're long I've been saying,

[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.160]
isn't it amazing how lucky Wayne got with this deal,

[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.480]
especially since his stock is down to like 11 and what is it?

[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.800]
What is that thing about that republic stock that they finally gave away in a check

[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.020]
because times are getting tough.

[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.140]
The market goes up almost 200 points yesterday, the Dow.

[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.800]
And auto nation closed yesterday, $11.93 and ¾ cent.

[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.960]
How do you like that?

[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.520]
I like it.

[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.720]
But at any rate, what was I talking about before I get into Wayne?

[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.420]
Remember?

[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.960]
No, I wasn't talking about him.

[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.220]
You were talking about him at length.

[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.080]
About the people that chew up and we've had great attendance all year long.

[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.280]
What I have been asking right from the beginning is,

[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.780]
why are these people here?

[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.180]
And I asked that question yesterday and didn't get the response I thought I should get.

[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.660]
You know something?

[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.860]
I know I didn't get the response.

[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.720]
You don't want to know why?

[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.380]
Because they don't know what the hell they're doing there.

[00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.200]
They're killing time.

[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.980]
And the point that I'm trying to make is that when you kid more and when you price the average fan out,

[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.520]
even in a place that's hockey crazy or sports crazy,

[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.740]
whatever the sport might be, like Toronto with a hockey.

[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.620]
And you wind up with all these other people in there and you say,

[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.540]
these are the people that we used to have coming to the games.

[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.680]
These are people that aren't just sitting on their hands.

[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.120]
They're reading a goddamn book.

[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.860]
They're in a coma.

[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.260]
They don't know what they're doing here.

[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.600]
And the same in a macaroon.

[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.240]
And I wonder I didn't have anybody respond to that question because they could,

[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.680]
if you held a gun to their earhead, they couldn't tell you what they're doing there.

[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.040]
And people like that are the ones who are passing the stuff around and when they're getting on their cell phone,

[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.840]
plastic posers.

[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.900]
That's what we got.

[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.480]
We got a PP stadium and we also, if you just change it into, you know, keep it simple.

[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.860]
Let's make it PP arena.

[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.240]
Plastic posers is what we mostly have in the macaroon.

[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.260]
Oh look, I'm here.

[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.780]
They're like I said yesterday.

[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.460]
They're waving at people across the way.

[00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.360]
And there's nobody waving back, but they're waving as if somebody really pays, it gives a crap that they're there.

[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.260]
Not to go into a big song that ends again about the people who sit in front of us about a half a dozen of them.

[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:14.640]
Mommy and daddy and grandma and grandpa and the 17 kids and what, and holding them up in the air and waving and anything they haven't excused

[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.980]
to wave something in front of your face just to make sure you can't see what's going on.

[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.560]
And that's why most people don't give a crap whether that's going on or not, whether they can see the goal light come on.

[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.240]
They're not there for that.

[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.500]
They're there to pose.

[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.540]
They're there to see and to be seen.

[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.480]
That's what it's all about.

[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.220]
And assholes like that are the ones that destroyed for the very small, I don't know what percentage it is now.

[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.520]
Those of us who really go to see an event, whatever it is, that's my point.

[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.460]
And that's why I'll second the emotion that I voiced yesterday if I'm the only one that says it.

[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.820]
Just like Depot, a nice guy on our depot.

[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.660]
Find a gruel small pair of last two days, tell these assholes about that NFL draft garbage.

[00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:01.240]
These draft nicks, these no life low life jackassers that think that that's an event that should require more than 30 seconds of their interest.

[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.180]
Who gives a crap?

[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.600]
Oh yeah, but lucky says the bird is going to draft the quarter.

[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.760]
Who cares about the bears?

[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.340]
How many bears fans do we have here?

[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.780]
Six? How many San Diego fans do we got here?

[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.120]
One?

[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:21.600]
But it's another excuse, it's another event, it's another hype job and people just all get sucked into it, man.

[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.780]
People with no lives, they get sucked into it, oh, it's something to do.

[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.540]
Something exciting.

[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.200]
Why is it exciting? Well, everybody said it was.

[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.540]
Greg Reed, by the way, has a cracked coxus.

[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.140]
Can I say that on the ear?

[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.000]
No.

[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.300]
Okay, Greg Reed has a cracked...

[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.620]
I guess that makes it worse.

[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.520]
He does.

[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.240]
This man, you know the word Schlamauzel, have you ever heard that word?

[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.540]
Schlamauzel is a yittish word that if you look it up in the yittish dictionary, Greg Reed's picture is next to it.

[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.840]
He had mono last week or the week before, for like a long time, spreading the disease around.

[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.860]
Now he's got a cracked coxus.

[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.140]
Because he had a little accident at the pool, forcing around with the kids the other day, trying to be, you know, overgrown child again.

[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.500]
Trying to be something he's not.

[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.300]
Like, you know, like a broadcast, that would also be something he's not.

[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.780]
Schlamauzel.

[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.960]
He brings me a letter that came in this morning.

[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.100]
WQM is the address.

[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.840]
Is that the Sheridan Street, by the way? Are we on Sheridan Street anymore?

[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.060]
No.

[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.840]
Well, it's been about a month they've been office Sheridan Street, but these people are a little slow.

[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.500]
And on the front of the envelope, Greg Reed.

[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.820]
Take a look at this. Take a look at this handwriting.

[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.740]
Postmarked, Broward, by the way. Probably somebody over the age of a 600.

[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.140]
It says, get rid of Neil Rogers and it's spelled.

[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.240]
See, we're on the Sam. We know you wrote it.

[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.280]
Even Greg said the Sam wrote this, say it letter. We're on the Sam. You know how we know?

[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.820]
It's spelled with a D.

[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.720]
RODG ERS, like that Adam and Marlon's opening day program.

[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.820]
Get rid of Neil Rogers. Put him out of his misery.

[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.700]
The low lives that listen to him will not be missed.

[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.920]
The numbers that listen to him must be sick of him too.

[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.440]
No name, no nothing.

[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.780]
Just scraggly old nasty, hateful, miserable, scrolling handwriting.

[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.680]
So it's either Sam the Sham or it's some old fart in Broward.

[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.440]
Some miserable, disgusting fart. Who is listening right now, by the way?

[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.280]
Just like the asshole that called the worst thing this morning calling it about Christy to moron is leaving?

[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.380]
Which we already knew that.

[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.420]
Doing everybody a public service and this guy calls in.

[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.240]
I shouldn't have known right off the bat that this guy was a major asshole.

[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.720]
Oh, we're sure we're going to miss Chris moron on those broadcasts.

[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.880]
If they're a hockey fan in the world that would miss Chris moron on the broadcast.

[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.140]
No. Somebody who refuses to describe the game.

[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:46.660]
No. No.

[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.020]
But this guy obviously knows nothing about this.

[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.000]
Sport like most people here.

[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.360]
And then he goes out about well the opportunity for Gildi.

[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.300]
And he has to throw in the gratuitous shot.

[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.880]
Well, I hear they want to neo-rodgers, but he's not of the right persuasion to broadcast those hockey games.

[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:05.360]
Well, I have bad news for you, sir, because I'm going to be doing the Panther games next season.

[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.660]
How do you like that?

[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.120]
Oh!

[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.160]
So blow it out your ass, mister.

[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.860]
Neo-rodgers will be doing Panther's hockey next season here on WQAN.

[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.460]
Markets up 35, the Anastas of 22.

[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:23.920]
Oh!

[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.960]
I don't know why you hate rumors so much.

[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.980]
Just because the seats were bad.

[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:31.620]
They weren't your seats.

[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.340]
You didn't go there.

[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:38.980]
He didn't get you seats in Maple Leaf Gardens a couple of years ago that had you jammed in the corner, like into the bricks in a corner somewhere.

[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.640]
I mean, you see, they may have been a million miles away, rumor, but at least they weren't obstructed view.

[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.740]
That's something...

[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.660]
You only good thing I could say about it.

[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:47.940]
Oh, but you can see me.

[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:48.820]
You can see me.

[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.240]
Yeah, I could see him up there, you know.

[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.760]
You could see him up there in the press box, putting on an axe, flipping me to bird.

[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.720]
But as far as seeing what was going on in the ice, especially if you have the ring, forget it.

[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.140]
Neo-rods, Neo-rods, we are EC, C-I-O-N.

[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.900]
We're in the Rexas' eye.

[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.140]
I'm not gonna take off my shoes.

[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.760]
We're gonna pop my dress.

[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.100]
It makes me wet when I see you, Jack.

[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.100]
I'm big in Rexas.

[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.100]
That's too big for my mouth.

[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.200]
I want a mercenary and a hot love tube.

[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.780]
And take it up my lubricated food suit.

[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:31.340]
Give me an air-regs, and ails me to the wall.

[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:31.880]
Okay.

[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.740]
He R-E-T-T-I-O-N.

[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.940]
I want a great purple.

[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.600]
I want your love and quality of you and your suit, your Lucy.

[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.100]
And then I'll give it a blow.

[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.200]
Here's a morning ticket.

[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.900]
And big SUV.

[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.360]
And we're in touch till you take up this.

[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.080]
I want a rack on this around your clothing tube.

[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.140]
And make your wonderworm explode with glue.

[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.100]
That's my rarest, uh, anish on circus side.

[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.240]
He R-G-C-T-I-O-N.

[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.460]
I want a great purple.

[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.640]
That's 15 to 560 W-D-Q-N-H-E-T-C-T.

[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.000]
We got hands up up to the U.S.

[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.520]
Give me an air-regs, honey like that, huh?

[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.100]
Come up six to 10th.

[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.440]
Most years on the road with that team.

[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.820]
With that team, oh boy.

[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.860]
And then 10 o'clock we got a cap on with the odds on whether these, uh,

[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.460]
no lives will make it through the weekend with their NFL draft.

[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.080]
Oh, but you don't understand.

[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.460]
It's important stuff, man.

[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:31.980]
Yeah, right.

[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:32.740]
Garbage.

[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.420]
Here's speaking of garbage.

[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.340]
Here's today's great letter of the editor in the hero.

[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.300]
And it won't be very significant.

[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.240]
I mean, it is a dumb letter.

[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.140]
It's only one sentence.

[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.160]
But wait a year who signs it when I tell you who this is.

[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.840]
Only I would have noticed this.

[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.120]
In fact, you know, every now and then they have those things that are put like in the one-ads.

[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.960]
And they're like messages like with kidnappings and ransom notes.

[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.820]
And they put a message in the a-one-ads.

[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.960]
Well, that's maybe this was put in there for my benefit.

[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.360]
And I didn't miss it.

[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.700]
The letter says could be possibly the bombing Kosovo to keep China gate off the front page.

[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.400]
Question mark.

[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:03.820]
That's it.

[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.440]
Signed, Tracy Foster in Miami.

[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.860]
Well, to most of you, probably all of you, that means nothing except for those of us, those of me,

[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.440]
who sit in here and get these facts out of the machine every morning.

[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.860]
And this scraggly, crazy, wild-widen, almost every single day of my life comes in here,

[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.980]
virtually all of it addressed to the worst team, by the way.

[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.700]
None of which they see because this isn't the facts machine for the sports nerds.

[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.140]
So all you people that keep faxing stuff for the sports people in here,

[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.740]
it goes right in the circular file immediately not sooner.

[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.100]
Oh!

[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.120]
Tracy Foster is the name that's used to be on the bottom of those letters.

[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:42.500]
If you could just see the handwriting, the scraggly, hysteria, the psychosis, you would understand.

[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.300]
And there it is in today's Miami Hero, a great letter to the editor from Tracy Foster.

[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:47.740]
Nice going.

[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.800]
Well, speak of the hero, by the way, there is something good in there, but I shouldn't know what it was.

[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:51.920]
Ah, Christ.

[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.540]
From my good friend Howard Kleinberg, nice going Howard.

[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.720]
This is to me one of the great columns that was ever written in the history of this town.

[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.000]
Not just because Howard's a friend of mine and a good guy and a long-suffering Panther fan.

[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.400]
Dinner at the famous, that was great food.

[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.480]
I'm going to read this a little later.

[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.700]
This is, this is, bring out, you probably never rated the real famous, didn't you?

[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.860]
No. Not a little spick like you.

[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.460]
In fact, it was your people that ruined it.

[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.820]
When your people started coming in, that's when the famous started moving up.

[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.260]
So how would always happens?

[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.120]
The Jews get pushed out and then some minorities come in.

[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.780]
I don't want to mention any, you know, any specific groups, but the Jews get pushed out.

[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.420]
And the next thing you know, minorities start coming in and up, there goes the neighborhood.

[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.600]
Oh, that's right.

[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.280]
What?

[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.660]
Cuban's didn't bring any neighborhood down.

[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.360]
On the beach?

[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.460]
There's no way out the Marriolitos didn't bring down parts of the Marriolitos.

[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.940]
They don't count, those are crazy prisoners.

[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:52.520]
Oh, okay.

[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:54.620]
Here's D'Aral.

[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:54.940]
Hello?

[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.520]
D'Aral?

[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.500]
Eight minutes and 26 seconds.

[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.760]
And counting.

[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.620]
Our first call of the day.

[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.240]
Hello, Gil!

[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.180]
Yeah, get with it.

[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.020]
Hey, what's going on, Neil?

[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:07.580]
How you doing, sir?

[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.600]
Hey, pretty good.

[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.860]
I couldn't agree with you anymore on your statement saying that we're being priced out of sports.

[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:14.880]
Absolutely.

[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.160]
I would not, you know, obviously.

[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.620]
See, it's about your plastic posters.

[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.980]
These are the people who can afford to show up for the most part.

[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.120]
They're not there to see the game, they're there to put on this big act for each other.

[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:30.360]
And the point I was trying to make yesterday, which evidently I didn't put over very successfully, was I would, for the most part, rather sit home in a comfort of my living room.

[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:40.520]
And if the game is on TV for free, why should I go there and then be surrounded by a bunch of people who don't care about the game in the first place, and who are there to, to schmooze and to interfere with my ability to enjoy it?

[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.100]
Who needs that?

[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.760]
And don't forget to look important on their cellular phones.

[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:43.940]
Right.

[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:50.240]
If I could get a, the cellular every time, like I, if I go to the gym, I actually see people on a treadmill on the phone.

[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.040]
On the treadmill.

[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.480]
What could you possibly talking about?

[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.180]
Reading here.

[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.040]
Maybe they're having a bone sex.

[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.460]
You talk about being plastic, man.

[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:05.360]
And as far as yesterday, I got satisfaction seeing the mountains get clobber, especially the picture.

[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:05.980]
What's his name?

[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:06.520]
Lea Vaughn.

[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:07.480]
Lea Vaughn.

[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.300]
Oh, it was great.

[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.980]
Yeah, but Elisabeth Elisabeth John had a great song about him.

[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.580]
Remember that can lead by when six games this year?

[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.980]
What do you think the answer is?

[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.180]
No.

[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.620]
You think they're going to do it?

[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.980]
I think they will definitely lose over 100 games this year.

[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:18.660]
Oh, man.

[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.540]
Oh, and Alex is on the, the, the, the DL by the way, to see that?

[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.300]
Well, Alex Fernandez, which maybe he'll come back and maybe he won't, although it's not as bad.

[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.220]
They, they, all these athletes here, they have to send the Alabama with a, something underneath.

[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.500]
Yeah, that's that.

[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:31.660]
That's that.

[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.320]
That's probably the first in the, Alex Fernandez.

[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.120]
I'll send to that doctor in Alabama.

[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.660]
Cause find it a good doctor down here.

[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.880]
I don't have to tell you boys like looking for a needle in a haystack.

[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.080]
Yeah.

[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.260]
And as far as getting that stadium in downtown, no chance.

[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.560]
I think it was amazing.

[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.900]
All these jerks that were on here just a week or 10 days ago.

[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:47.080]
Yeah.

[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.560]
And like, like it was a done deal.

[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:48.960]
Oh, yeah.

[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.580]
It's not a question of if it's just a question of where we're going to put it.

[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.480]
That, you know, not a question of whether we're going to have a stadium where we need one or the public is going to support this.

[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.080]
How in God's name could anybody with a brain now?

[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.280]
With this garbage product they're trying to pawn off on a public where there's no interest whatsoever.

[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.240]
It's very obvious.

[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.420]
How can they expect anybody to spend any money, especially in a town that's already bankrupt?

[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:08.940]
Exactly.

[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:09.600]
No chance.

[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.060]
One thing before I go now.

[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:11.440]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.280]
You played some for me about two years ago.

[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.400]
I think it's called, I heard it on the radio.

[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.620]
No, I saw it on the radio.

[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:16.920]
Yeah.

[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.020]
Could you play that for me?

[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.700]
I'll think about it.

[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.140]
Appreciate it.

[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:19.500]
Okay.

[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.340]
See ya.

[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.340]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:30.620]
Just let one person call here and say we need a baseball stadium and believe me, I'll get really pissed off and fired up.

[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.040]
A baseball stadium.

[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.180]
Are you people out of your minds?

[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:34.880]
Is that the problem?

[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:40.040]
We can have another place for plastic posters to go who don't know what the hell they're watching and don't have any interest.

[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.340]
That's what's happening to your sports boys and girls.

[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:46.500]
They have priced it out of the realm of the ordinary fan and their families.

[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.940]
Those people are really want to go.

[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.580]
The people that used to be able to go.

[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.080]
That actually give a crap about what's going on out there.

[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.020]
And so now the people who are there, like I said, a whole day I spent yesterday, three hours and five minutes.

[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.120]
Couldn't get an answer.

[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.200]
Why did they go?

[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.680]
And they can't answer it.

[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.480]
They couldn't tell you.

[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:08.200]
Because 90% of them don't give a flying crap about what's going out there out on the field, on the ice, whatever the hell it is.

[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.360]
They're there so we can be impressed by their presence.

[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.420]
Like a holiday time.

[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.800]
Are you impressed with my presence?

[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:16.880]
Huh?

[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:17.320]
No.

[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.340]
Yeah, like I thought.

[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.560]
Are you impressed with the free seats you got for a member there?

[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:20.800]
No.

[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.600]
Oh my god.

[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.180]
I mean, if that's the best you can do, you know.

[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.000]
If that's the best you can do, I'll talk to my good friend Joe Bowen.

[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.500]
I'll talk to Harry Neal.

[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.240]
I'll talk to the people on the inside of there.

[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.820]
If I want to go back there, maybe I'd enjoy the air-can of the center better if I had good seats.

[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.380]
And I could sit with the real fans.

[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.500]
Not over there in my section where everybody, I mean, at least only scored five times in those first two periods.

[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.040]
I didn't stay for the four goals in the third, but five times I'm up there screaming and shouting.

[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.200]
And they're all sitting on their hands.

[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:53.440]
I felt like, and I went, and I'm not going to say I felt like I was back in mine because at least if nothing else here, when a panther score, even when I'd see in the goal light, they're up there.

[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.240]
Yeah, you know, why I'm not sure, but they're doing it.

[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.240]
Giving an excuse to make it, makes it look like they really know what's going on.

[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.660]
Oh, and by the way, I've decided I had that tough dilemma.

[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.160]
I am giving away a bottom end today.

[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.640]
My tickets for Saturday, panthers in Tampa Bay.

[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.900]
But I decided to go tomorrow, not because they, you know, Kirk McLean, by the way, played Great Last Night.

[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.420]
Denise Pontfan, that dumb frog, comes up with a new name for Kirk McLean.

[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.960]
His name now is Sean McLean.

[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.120]
Yeah, he called them Sean McLean last night.

[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.720]
Great night, great going air girl, Kirk.

[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.420]
Oh, that's out of what, too nothing.

[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.200]
But that's not why I'm going.

[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.140]
So if we got to Sean McLean, then Arthur Gweli must be Kirk Burke.

[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.320]
Is that what it is?

[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:36.880]
Kirk Burke rhymes with jerk, which is you, Denise, you idiot, you dumb frog, which hopefully will get that tape today.

[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.960]
But I've decided I am going tomorrow if Beth Cohen gets to sing the National Anthem,

[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.680]
because we got the Montreal Canadian, so there will be two National Anthem's tomorrow.

[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.700]
And I want to hear Beth Cohen sing O Canada.

[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.820]
And we'll hear from Beth today.

[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.680]
We love your Beth, you're the best.

[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.480]
Come at the end of the year, we finally got somebody that can sing a stirring,

[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.680]
great rendition of the National Anthem's.

[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.960]
Nice going Beth, you're the best sweetheart.

[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.660]
And of course, why not have a juice sing in sunrise, you know?

[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:01.800]
Isn't that appropriate?

[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.900]
Having a Jewish lady?

[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.280]
I mean, you know, the sparks are the black guy.

[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.000]
He's very good.

[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.720]
What was his name, Sean Eberen, something like that?

[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.520]
The guy with a little earring, with no hair.

[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.720]
He's excellent, but not as good as Beth.

[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:14.520]
I hate to say that.

[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.120]
Not because he's Jewish, not because he's got a suntan,

[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.680]
but because he's a little bit better.

[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.160]
He's great.

[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.520]
But she's better.

[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.700]
Here's plantation, hello.

[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:25.980]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:26.480]
Okay, sir.

[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.380]
Hey, about a 15 year listener, never called.

[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:28.980]
All right.

[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.260]
I've been looking forward to my broadcast of Pantheosaki.

[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.340]
That's what I'm calling you about.

[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:33.580]
Yeah.

[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.460]
Is your partner still going to be Randy?

[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.040]
Yeah.

[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.220]
Is that a yes?

[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:37.700]
Yes.

[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:38.500]
Unbelievable.

[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.140]
Yeah.

[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.940]
I've been to all 40, all but two of the games.

[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:43.320]
Yeah.

[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.880]
I've never imposed on you.

[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.040]
Not because I don't like you.

[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:46.880]
You've put it on me for what?

[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.760]
Just to say hello.

[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.660]
Stick my, you know, by pushing your face around.

[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:49.940]

[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:50.560]
Oh, that's good.

[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.580]
I hear you can see the gold light from up on the sky level

[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.480]
where you'll be calling the game.

[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:55.940]
That's good.

[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:56.720]
All right, Neil.

[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.100]
That's the only place you can see it, by the way.

[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.520]
Yeah, you can see real good from up there.

[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:00.960]
Good luck to you, next.

[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.320]
In fact, that's always Denise's,

[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.360]
potpins, excuse, blinded by the light.

[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:04.860]
That.

[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.720]
And go show him a queen.

[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:07.820]
Okay, thanks.

[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:08.580]
Good luck.

[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.180]
Okay, see you.

[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.860]
This guy really believe I'm doing the game.

[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.120]
See, I would be great because I have called hockey

[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.660]
and I'm probably one of the best in North America

[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.520]
next to Joe Bowen.

[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.060]
But the chances of my working for Wayne Heiseng

[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.500]
if there's any chance of that, of course not.

[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.280]
I mean, I could say to Greg Reade,

[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.140]
hey, I'll do the home games.

[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.300]
I can't go on the road and screw up my schedule of this show

[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.020]
because that's what we make all the money on this show.

[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.300]
I could say that,

[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.680]
and the panthers would say,

[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.700]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:33.980]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.640]
I'm not gonna be a suck-ass because when you work

[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.600]
involved in any way,

[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.920]
because you don't work for the radio station,

[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.620]
you work for the organization,

[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.720]
so you have to be an ass sucker.

[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.840]
You have to get the tongue out, licky, licky, licky, and I'm not going to lick Wayne, you know.

[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.980]
There's some things I look, you know, but not Wayne.

[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:53.160]
So who knows what evil lurks who's going to be the next radio voice of the panthers?

[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.040]
Chris Moore is out.

[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.920]
We have, you know, something real hockey fans, all ten of us in this now ought to be having

[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.120]
big parties all over the place.

[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.540]
Six years, not of mediocrity.

[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.460]
Six years of totally grotesque, unacceptable work.

[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:13.000]
Making the most exciting sporting event in the world sound terminally dull and boring.

[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.940]
Only that red, that orange hair, I had a jerk, Paul Harvey Jr.

[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.500]
Only he thought that this guy was a hockey broadcaster and only because he never heard

[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.060]
anybody do it besides him.

[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.300]
You know, it's like if you went into a doctor, went into a doctor's office and they drew

[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.260]
blood, you know.

[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.380]
And they left this big, gigantic wealth on your arm.

[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.000]
Like the one I have on my left arm right now.

[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.640]
And you thought, hey, that was a great job, you know, it didn't hurt too bad.

[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.760]
If it was the first, the only time in your life you ever had blood drawn, you wouldn't,

[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.780]
you know, you wouldn't know that it doesn't have to look like that.

[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.820]
It doesn't have to feel like that.

[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.300]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:51.180]
If they tied the tourniquet around your arm, like ten times too tight before they took

[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.760]
the blood out and they left it there while they were talking up, pah, pah, pah, pah,

[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.300]
pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, like that.

[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.320]
And you felt like you were laying to film, like all of a sudden you would become an orthodox.

[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.220]
Like you were Jones in for some matta and it was middle of July and you couldn't figure

[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:04.840]
out why.

[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:05.960]
Huh?

[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.480]
Then you would know, if that was your only experience you think this was great.

[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.520]
It's like the thing with the ice cream I'm always talking about.

[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.080]
If you only, if you never had any other flavor besides vanilla, you think, hey, this

[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:15.840]
is pretty good stuff.

[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.540]
You follow what I'm saying?

[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.560]
If you only had sex with like, you know, Roseanne Bar.

[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.080]
You think, hmm, not bad.

[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.800]
Ten twenty six.

[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.740]
If you only had sex with like, birthday rolls.

[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:34.280]
Hahaha.

[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.960]
Deal Roger's got it.

[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.080]
Yeah.

[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.560]
Five weeks and I'm weak.

[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.560]
It mellows me out for the peace I see.

[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:56.060]
Like, I'm not going to be a little bit more than you.

[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:56.060]

[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.280]
Like that bomb, here I go again.

[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:07.260]
I got the mud cheese, mixed me want to snack, then I'll lie down, going to take it now.

[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:13.320]
And then I'll get up and I'll make a tract, a couple of toasts and the buzz is coming back.

[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.340]
Now I get a thrill wherever all that weed.

[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.200]
Talk about my favorite to the meal in your sea.

[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.080]
Mix the mixer catch and I'll sell you a little too.

[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.200]
There's our only roll up on the snow to pass.

[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.280]
Oh, I thought I'd hate to take that here and test.

[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.440]
I'm on back for just one.

[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:38.620]
Got only no with the illegal grass grows.

[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.460]
This is a good stuff, man.

[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.440]
Give me call face.

[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.920]
All right.

[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.560]
Ten thirty two or five fifty WQAM.

[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.420]
So anyway, we just got a copy of our good close personal friend, David Halberstam's book,

[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.620]
Sports on Radio in New York, which that little ass sucker, that little putt, very jackass,

[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.160]
was quoting from here a few days ago about Christina Moore.

[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.680]
On page 89, and this is an interesting book, by the way.

[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.360]
Of course, I'm just leaving through it and boy, it brings back a lot of incredible memories,

[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.520]
even if you're not from New York.

[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.660]
But if you know all these sports casters, here's even two pages of foster hue in here.

[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.000]
How do you like that, eh?

[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.140]
But I'll every announce you that's ever been born.

[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.660]
Here's the young Marv Albertan here before we started making all those back fighting comments.

[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.800]
And here's the great Jim Woods.

[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.360]
Here's the Peter Jack Brickhouse.

[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.520]
Johnny Most.

[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.760]
We was robbed.

[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:31.840]
Here's Chick Herne.

[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.440]
Man, this is great stuff.

[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:34.920]
I don't know.

[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.760]
Here's the Gary Thorn.

[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.780]
Good guy, Gary Thorn.

[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.580]
It's a good job, a little bit hysterical, but he does a good job on ESPN.

[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.220]
He's no one needs pot fan, but.

[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.620]
So anyway, here's what it says about Christina Moore.

[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.460]
And evidently, Dale Arnold, who is terminally boring, who does the Bruins games on Nesson,

[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.900]
he preceded Chris Moore in Jersey with the Devils games.

[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:57.460]
And it's talking about Jean Hart, the one-time flyers for many, many years, great broadcaster.

[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.100]
It says Hart had a definite opinion in Arnold's replacement in 1988 on WABC.

[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:07.340]
It's a TV call referring to the style of Chris Moore, who got his NHL break with the Devils.

[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.780]
And then, then unfortunately, David Halberst then goes on to suck Chris's ass.

[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.760]
He says Chris met four seasons in New Jersey, appeared in which he did a good job of ricking

[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.020]
in a woman-color commentator, Sherry Ross.

[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:24.020]
Moore's easygoing conversational style was quite disarming, enabling Ross to feel comfortable behind the microphone.

[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:29.600]
Sherry, a one-time reporter, returned to the newspaper after four years, unlike Susan Waldman, who's done some color,

[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.580]
Sherry was not quite as emotional or vehement in her own near opinions.

[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:41.460]
While Moore was criticized for a non-radio, non-descriptive style, he knew hockey and would make bold comments that other play-by-play people would be afraid to make.

[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.920]
If they continue this open style, they won't win.

[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.980]
This one sentence is quite redeeming and captures a thousand words.

[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:53.240]
When Moore wasn't renewed in New Jersey in 1993, he was hired by the expansion of Florida Panthers

[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:58.900]
and has enjoyed a successful career as play-by-play man, Ad Talk Show host, not in South Florida.

[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:05.320]
Mike Miller, a solid technically accurate announcer, more in the mold of Arnold followed Moore at the Metallands with the Devils.

[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.460]
But this book looks pretty interesting.

[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.640]
In fact, I think I'm going to read it today. Here's Ted Hughesing. Anybody remember Ted Hughesing?

[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.380]
No, of course not.

[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.920]
Going way, way back. This is Jack Buck.

[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.600]
Sports on Radio in New York, a play-by-play history by David Halberstin.

[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:29.480]
Lots of good pictures in here. There's Mike Francesa and Chris Russo and all sorts of folks.

[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.280]
Art Rust, any interest? No. I don't think so.

[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.180]
Here's a mobile impombi, Chilla.

[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:36.920]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir.

[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:41.220]
How are you, sir? I got an idea for all these people that want to have a baseball stadium with a dome.

[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.100]
I said, move the mallans to the Miami Arena. They probably have a cellar every day.

[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.800]
Yeah, they got a dome, that's right. They can play inside.

[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.760]
And it wouldn't be very strong for a long run either.

[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:51.980]
It wouldn't be very strong for a long run either.

[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:56.300]
It wouldn't be the seats they had to cut out to make room for the baseball field. They probably have about 1500 seats. That should be enough.

[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:57.940]
It's so. Yeah.

[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.040]
Have a great day.

[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:03.660]
And back to it. Can you imagine the crowds that I use that term loosely? They're going to have out there by July when it gets stopped.

[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:08.660]
It would be 100. It was 94 on Sunday with their 14,000 announced they had out there for Alex Fernandez.

[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.740]
And if it wouldn't have been for those 16 Cubans that came out to see their hero Alex Fernandez,

[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.520]
you can imagine what kind of a crowd it would have been.

[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.460]
There's no, there's no interest.

[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.940]
Just like you mark my words, there will be no interest.

[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:25.340]
I'm giving away these tickets and my personal parking pass for the Tampa Lightning, for the Lightning Panthers Game on Saturday.

[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.000]
And let me preface it by saying this.

[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:32.820]
I will verbally assault anyone who is going to go to that game verbally.

[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:37.240]
I mean, it's a free country if you got the tickets. That I love the old line. Well, I already paid for them.

[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.700]
So what does that have to do with it?

[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.760]
You already paid for them.

[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:52.940]
It would be like if you went to the store and you bought like a six pack of beer and you drank one of them and it was like a 20 years old or was stale, sour, rotten, flat, whatever was.

[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.560]
And you started drinking the other ones that well, I might as well drink them because I already paid for them.

[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:02.100]
So yes, I am going to like attack anybody who plans on going to that game Saturday.

[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:03.880]
The Panthers and Tampa Bay.

[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.260]
What could you possibly be thinking of?

[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:16.700]
What kind of a life could you possibly have that you have that much spare time on a Saturday night that you would go to see such a grotesque excuse for an event?

[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.580]
Here's a mobile of North Lauderdale. Hello.

[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.600]
Hello. Yes, sir.

[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:29.980]
Well, I hope that I am the one that you want to rag on about the hockey because I get my only call.

[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:36.980]
They don't want these tickets. This is going to be the first time in history of the show I'm given something away that's actually worth like 57 times to 115 bucks.

[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.040]
And the parking about 135 bucks, there will be no takers you watch.

[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.300]
I want to tell you I want to be the taker and I'll explain to you why.

[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.540]
I have an eight year old son who plays Golly on a roller hockey team.

[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:55.480]
Yeah, a roller hockey roller hockey. You just say 5 6 7 0. What are you laughing about?

[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:03.220]
0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on a mobile one line. You'll see there be no interest in these tickets. I mean, what kind of a bird brain would go to that game?

[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.420]
Hunt the lightning in the Panthers.

[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:09.260]
Two teams not only not going to make the playoffs, but two teams to the worst.

[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:15.660]
I mean, the Panthers just decimated with injuries and even when the injuries forgetting about the injuries, not too much to write home about either all year.

[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:22.320]
I mean, for the kind of money that they're charging and I don't care what anybody says, they've shown up in big numbers.

[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.400]
Like I said, because they don't really care about the product out there and Wayne's very lucky about that.

[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.060]
Once again, he winds up with a big horseshoe and his back to him.

[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.280]
Even though that's stocking with a crap.

[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:39.380]
The kind of product that they put out there these last two years, the fact that anybody is willing for getting about paying for the tickets just even to show up, that's a major miracle.

[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.220]
But that's the American FN way now. See with the whole sports field.

[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:49.220]
It's like you're supposed to feel obligated to go even if they go out there and put a garbage product out there in front of you're supposed to feel obligated.

[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:58.040]
Even if they just soaked the crap out of you if they squeezed the lifeblood out of your bank account, you're supposed to feel like, oh, well, it's my duty to go.

[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.500]
Holy cow, Aaron's coming.

[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.820]
Well, I was throwing out on drugs and I'm cute on the road because I was filled with liquor and loon.

[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:31.140]
We got to walk in a man with a car that has been dead and I'm a friend of Bill Doe for you.

[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:31.960]
Oh, right.

[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:38.680]
Jesus, in power with your skin turning yellow, your face on red and through.

[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:46.900]
Your visions are three years, cause you're sharing a view where the woman who's got never to be.

[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:55.500]
She was a lonely one to give me twelve steps, give me twelve steps, five to give me thirteen, maybe more.

[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:20.240]
I'm getting real tired of throwing my page and then blowing one point four.

[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.920]
That's me in a big town.

[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:31.060]
1044-550 WQM. Of course, if you stay home and watch all these sporting events, you can't have nobody spill their beer all over you.

[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:31.700]
What fun is that?

[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.160]
Here's the fact that says Neil, did you hear that Chris Moran is leaving the Panthers broadcast after this season?

[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:37.400]
No.

[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.160]
You hear that, George?

[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:38.440]
No.

[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:39.100]
Didn't hear that.

[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.280]
Check the Harold Sports page. It's on the second or third page.

[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:42.620]
No.

[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:43.400]
Have we heard about that?

[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:43.680]
No.

[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:44.840]
Not since yesterday.

[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:45.660]
What are we going to do now?

[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.060]
Yeah, we were told yesterday.

[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.380]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.440]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:52.600]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:52.740]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:52.780]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:52.980]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:53.580]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.180]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.580]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:55.860]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:55.860]

[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:56.480]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:56.540]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.120]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.960]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.240]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.180]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.360]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:05.140]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.100]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.200]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.920]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.320]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.000]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:39.220]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:39.280]

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:39.280]

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:39.280]

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:39.280]

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:39.280]

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:39.280]

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:39.280]

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:39.280]

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:39.280]

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:39.280]

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:39.280]

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:39.280]

[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:39.580]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:39.580]

[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:39.580]

[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:39.580]

[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:39.580]

[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:39.580]

[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:39.640]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.340]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.820]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.020]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.980]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.420]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.000]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.000]

[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.000]

[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.000]

[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.000]

[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.000]

[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.360]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.120]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:00.180]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:00.560]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:00.840]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.100]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:01.540]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:01.760]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.460]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:02.980]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.100]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.260]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.760]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.400]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.280]
We had a lot of fun.

[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.040]

[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.040]

[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.040]

[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.040]

[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.040]

[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.040]

[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.040]

[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.040]

[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.500]
That was...

[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:36.560]
All day long.

[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:37.860]
You see what I'm saying?

[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:40.720]
I'm not for that.

[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:41.700]
I don't go for that.

[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:45.000]
I'm old enough to remember when you go to a game and there was no all those other trappings.

[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:47.560]
And you got excited because you went in to whatever was going on.

[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.580]
And hopefully it was a quality event.

[00:51:49.820 --> 00:52:02.660]
And there was something exciting going on.

[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:09.780]
Who lives on a rock? He's adding the metal just shaking his teeth at some boys who were

[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:16.400]
down by the fritz. They're beating the water, their hands on their marbles and clay things

[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:22.960]
and at that pass-four. There came a young lady, she looked like a pretty young creature,

[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:29.760]
she sat on the grass. She pulled up her dress and she showed them her rumbles and laces

[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:36.980]
and white fluffy duck. She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children so

[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:42.840]
they would not spit. While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling raps, you send

[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:49.700]
litter from yesterday's hunt. While the girl in the meadow was rubbing her eyes at the

[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:57.060]
fellow, down by the dot, he looked like a man with a side of a home in the country

[00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:03.280]
with a big fence out front. If he had her phone like me, she'd show him her little pet

[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:10.460]
dog who was subject to fence. And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her small tender and

[00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:17.400]
with a movement so quick. And then she'd bend over and suck God his candy so tasty

[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:24.120]
made of butter, scotch. And then he spread with cream all over her cookies that she

[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:29.840]
had left out on her shelf. If you think this is dirty, you can go for yourself.

[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:35.460]
1114 and 550 WMT. I'm getting goose bumps looking at this, they have halberstown book.

[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:41.220]
Problem is down here, most of the people down here grew up here and never heard any of

[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:44.080]
the great broadcasters because they couldn't hear those things fall over the country like

[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.720]
we could have north or they grew up in some foreign country. I don't want to mention

[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:51.780]
no names, you know. So what do they know about sports casters? Here's, oh, now we get to

[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:58.480]
the part. Here's all the ex jox. There's Joe, oh my God. Oh, and Phil Rosuto and Bill

[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:04.560]
White. And who's the most illiterate one of them all, Fran Healy. I mean, it's not even

[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:10.820]
a contest, okay? The thick tongue dored Fran Healy. He went to jox took over sports casters

[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:16.660]
and then when it turned into crap. So yesterday speaking of that, I was George told me as usual

[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:21.540]
bad information. I was asking, where can you get those atkins diet bars? The very low

[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:25.920]
carbohydrate. Not that they're very good. They're, but it's something, you know, something

[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:29.080]
better than eating crap. Eating was a candy or something with a lot of carbohydrates.

[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:33.280]
And all of his wife goes and gets back full of them that publics he says. So I go to my

[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:38.220]
publics yesterday afternoon, I scoured, I looked high, I looked low, I looked in the diet

[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:42.120]
foods, I looked in the health foods, I looked in the candy section, I looked under every

[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:46.540]
goddamn section, did I find them? Yeah. And I went to Walgreens, I looked around and there,

[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:51.740]
I looked, oh, and by the way, you know, those, I got to tell you something seriously. There

[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:55.440]
have got to be, how come we're sitting here? Why aren't we making millions every day?

[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:59.300]
There's so many stupid people out there. I'm at Walgreens and I'm looking back where

[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:06.260]
they have the smooth fast and all that direct. And they've got all these diet bars. And I

[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:15.860]
look at the carbohydrates on these 50 grams, 35 grams, low and fat, but loaded with carbohydrates.

[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:19.900]
Does anybody got to probably lose weight with that crap? No. No. Even if that's all I

[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.720]
eat is those bars, you know, a half a dozen of them a day. Are they going to lose weight?

[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:26.660]
No. I mean, a half a dozen times five at a time, 50, that's 300 grams a day of carbs.

[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:32.580]
Couldn't find the goddamn actins or whatever, what do they call those? Advantage bars? And

[00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:35.720]
the only advantages that they're low in carbs, not that they taste very good. And you

[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:40.380]
think that, you know, our good buddy Bob Lincoln, wouldn't you think that he brought us a

[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:45.160]
whole bag full of those? My good close personal friend Bob Lincoln, that did those two great

[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:52.920]
trips to Vegas and practically put us all into our graves. Viva Las Vegas. He's the best.

[00:55:53.100 --> 00:56:00.060]
He's a good guy. He's a good guy. Okay, where we going? Let's go. Well, he brings me a

[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:03.840]
lot of free stuff. Okay, he and he hooked me up with my good buddy Richard there. I know

[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:07.160]
it's European flights, which I'll tell you all about it after the next one and see how

[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:13.340]
good it turns out to be. Get me off that Martin scary airline. I mean, Martin is okay.

[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:17.280]
It's the price is right, but if you don't mind being cramped up like sitting like real

[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:22.920]
like in a box in a shoe box for eight and a half, nine hours, it's okay. Here's a mobile

[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:29.060]
in Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Hi, how you doing? Great. Speaking of actin, I was going to

[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:34.540]
ask you, you mentioned those Tyson beef strips. Right. At one point, where do you get those?

[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:39.420]
I can't find them. Sure, all the publics have gone. In the freezer section. You know

[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:44.400]
where they have like the frozen bags, like stir fry stuff, stir fry chain. That's where

[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:48.080]
you'll find them with the Tyson stuff and the frozen bag thing. Just look for the old bags

[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:52.020]
in publics. And one more thing. You had one's gotten a scale, one of those professional

[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:56.440]
doctor scale. Yes, sir. Where did you get that? Where do we get that? George from a medical

[00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:01.060]
supply place in Evan, in Evan, in Evan, called We Don't Know What's Call. I forget. Just

[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:05.560]
looking your in the yellow pages under medical supply and you'll find some place near you.

[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:08.760]
They're all over the place. They're expensive. How much did I pay for that? Like two, three

[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:13.760]
hundred bucks? Three hundred bucks. Three hundred dollars? Yeah. I don't know. Like I said,

[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:17.600]
get a crappy old scale. I got a crappy old scale. I got a crappy old scale. See, you know,

[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:22.040]
crappy. Did you get the tape from the guy that said that he? Not yet. Not yet. He promised

[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:25.980]
to him. Believe me. The minute we get it, you'll hear it. Thanks a lot. Okay, pal. Good

[00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:29.340]
luck. There's another guy that we'll try to lose some weight. All you fat people out

[00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:33.640]
there are begging you. We got to lose some weight. We got to lose weight. I know I've been

[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:37.580]
huckin' this for the last, but as long as you're still breathing, kiss the ground that

[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:41.100]
you're still alive. By the way, what are we having for lunch today? Ha ha ha. Well, you

[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:44.500]
know, I've been eating these meatballs. The guy with a real nerdy voice that called her

[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:49.200]
at Friday sounded like a dip shot, but he was right. I can't be eating meatballs. And you

[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:52.980]
know something? Breadcrumbs add nothing to meatballs. You know why they put them in there?

[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:58.020]
Filler. Don't know to hold them together. Oh. That's the only reason they put breadcrumbs

[00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:00.940]
in meatballs is so that they don't all come apart while they're cooking them like in

[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:06.980]
whatever they cook them in. And they have no taste, breadcrumbs. None. Don't you think

[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:10.180]
we could find something that makes meatballs without breadcrumbs with that piece? Oh, it's

[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:15.140]
picking up a place that makes meatballs. I would be remiss since our good buddies got

[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:20.100]
more free publicity. The city link, it's got out today, but I'm sure we won't get one

[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:25.520]
up here maybe tomorrow. Maybe for lucky. You know the best of that issue? Well, guess what?

[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:29.180]
The best radio station they picked today, they fenced over this part. They didn't

[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:32.180]
fax over the best radio personnel. I guess they didn't want to send me a seat. They picked,

[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:40.860]
you know, birthday annules. Probably. But best place for pizza in Southwest Broward,

[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:47.960]
George. Guess I'll give you 48 guesses in the first 49 don't count. Pizza lost? Yes. Yes.

[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:53.560]
Chef proprietor Jeff Cohen in business since 1975 knows the secret of living up to his

[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:57.160]
only restaurants claim the fame as the world's best pizza. It's a by the way, it's not

[00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:01.300]
the world's best pizza. It's good stuff, but I mean that's ridiculous. He hasn't expanded

[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:04.740]
to a chain of restaurants, but kept the focus on what establishment with a seating for

[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:10.160]
180 where he serves a killer pizza. Toppings range from traditional to exotic, the secrets

[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:14.360]
in the homemade tomato sauce topping and the dose of tasty won't leave the crust on your

[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:19.300]
plate. It'll be in your underwear. No wonder the way to hear this. No wonder the women's

[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:23.260]
bathroom has a wall of favorable reviews and an autographed picture of pizza lost fan

[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:28.680]
Dan Marino. When you see he knows that you're going to be spending a lot of time in the

[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:32.020]
tea room when he's there. I mean like immediately after you've finished the last bite,

[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:37.060]
I'll say I listen, I got to make a quick move here. Quick movement. So they have plenty

[00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:41.020]
of time to read the stuff in there because they're going to be doing a lot of time in

[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:44.980]
there. There you go. Nice going ponytail. More free publicity. He's probably feeding

[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:49.720]
him free over there at CityLinke. But we still haven't seen the rest of that. Here's a mobile

[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:57.260]
in parkland. Hello. Okay. Nice talking to you. Whatever that was. Here's a mobile in

[00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:02.260]
candle. Hello. Hello Neil. Yes sir. How are you today? Okay. I read in the Miami

[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:06.480]
Arrow this morning. I just want to know which way an asshole is. He got his first paycheck

[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:10.300]
in three years. Heisenge gets first check in three years. But the good news I got the

[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:14.060]
article right in front of me here. The good news is shares of auto nation closed Monday

[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:18.440]
at eleven dollars nine and three quarters or ninety three cents. They would have to nearly

[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.400]
double in price to reach the exercise price of Heisenge's options. So I guess we're going

[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:26.220]
to have to like you know raise it and take up a fundraiser form because times are really

[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:29.720]
tough for auto nation would public whatever you want to call it. They're in the crapper.

[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:33.680]
I'm telling you Neil. So his billion is probably only worth six hundred million now. So

[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:38.600]
we take up a collection. Oh my god. Like he really needs it. Exactly. I don't have a good

[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.580]
day. And back to you. Yeah Wayne gets his first paycheck. Come on. Let's cry some crocodile

[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:48.280]
tears for a good old way. Let's score them all over the place. First check in nearly

[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:51.720]
three years from auto nation. And of course you can understand why because they're losing

[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:57.860]
their ass. Especially people that bought that stock. Oh eleven and three quarters. Five

[01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:03.120]
six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line. Here's the great

[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:07.120]
Jim Gore. Anybody from New York? Remember Jim Gordon? Huh? Remember him? No. He's in his

[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:12.880]
book by Halberstead. Here's the great Jim Woods. The possum. Well, it was he good. He worked

[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.120]
with he worked in a lot of places but he worked with Bob Prince and Pittsburgh on KDK and

[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.180]
the pirates for several years. He worked with the Yankees with Mel Allen and Red Barber for

[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:26.280]
years in New York. Worked in St. Louis on KMOX with Harry Carey. The possum Jim Woods.

[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.420]
He was great. There's Vince Cully and you know something I've never been of Vince Cully

[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:35.180]
fan. But last night I'm scouring after the last hockey was on. I'm scouring and I'm coming

[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:38.740]
through the baseball package on the small dish and there's the Dodger game Dodgers in Arizona.

[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:44.540]
Which by the way they sure draw out there. And Vince Cully of course is doing the game

[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:48.800]
on Fox. And as much as I'm not of Vince Cully fan, it's just so refreshing to hear a voice

[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.600]
that you recognize and somebody that at least is a broadcaster as opposed to just another

[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:59.040]
dumb ex-jock. Oh here's Bill Mauser. Boy look at that picture. You talk about an old

[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.760]
unflattering picture. Not that he ever looked good. Bill Mauser who started of course in

[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:08.100]
Buffalo. Anybody remember him from Buffalo? No. WGR? Huh? Bill Mauser and then much in New

[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:11.780]
York and became like legendary on the radio. There's a sports. Here's Marty Glickman again.

[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:18.800]
Marty Glickman. Five six. Anybody remember any of these people? No. Then think so. Five six

[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.440]
seven. Oh five six. Do you see I'm in the wrong place? I'm in a place with people that

[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:26.200]
I don't know if these people know. What do they know? Do they know anything at all? Where

[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:32.620]
have they been? Do we know? No. No. No. No. God. Oh don't let me forget to read the

[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:39.040]
circle a little later. Howard Kleinberg about to be a famous ice-cold Howard. Seriously

[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:43.600]
where have you been all your life? The people from New York. What did they do when they

[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.580]
were up there? Did they get like lost in the subway and just keep riding around and

[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:52.380]
around underground? Is that what it was? They never came up for oxygen? All the people

[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:56.360]
from the Midwest. I mean any of the things that are the least been interesting to me. Do

[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:00.560]
they have any concept what I'm even talking about? No. Like that story about the three drivers

[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:04.720]
are at freeholds. Do they? They wouldn't know a selfie if somebody stuck it in their

[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.500]
back there. I don't know what that is. Oh you mean the buggy horses? Is that it? The

[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:14.560]
buggies. Speaking of that here's Pompano. Hello. Speaking of Holt in the dirt. How about

[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.340]
Jerry Eisenberg? You've seen your books? Who? Jerry Eisenberg. I never heard of him.

[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:23.380]
Other New York. Let me let me look it up. Bill Mauser on Sports Lecture Channel 5, New

[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:30.180]
York. Eisenberg? Yeah with an eye. No. Oh with an eye? Yep. We got Bob Eisenberg

[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:34.780]
here with a real bad hair piece in our sales department. Not in here. Not in here.

[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:40.060]
That's Hank with no it's going to hang some podgers. Yeah. Not in here. We recognize all

[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:44.420]
those names who are smelling at us. Do you remember Jim Gordon? I was seen in New York.

[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:50.980]
Yeah. Oh yeah he did the nicks in the Rangers for years. No, I remember Jim Gordon. 45

[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:55.100]
years he was on the year up there. Definitely Morty. Morty. Morty. Morty. Here's Bob

[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:59.380]
Murphy, a lion, a lion and a lion and a Ralph Kiner who even with a stroke doesn't sound

[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:03.480]
any worse than he used to before. Kiner's corner. Here's Harry. Here's Harry. He

[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.380]
ain't sounded too good these days. In fact I came across the very end of the cub game yesterday

[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:10.220]
after the one I got home and I'm sitting there wondering where the hell is Harry. It goes

[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:13.200]
to show you how you know I'm saying for just a few seconds of what we're the hell is

[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.380]
Harry and then I realized oh he's dead. You know how they gave him a statue outside of

[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:20.480]
the reggae field. Yeah the very least. But I feel we're scanning the baseball package last

[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.920]
night and came upon Vince Kelly. You know it's unusual just find just one man in the

[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.460]
booth doing a game. He's still doing it by himself and the games too right? What's the deal

[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:30.920]
with that little one? That goes to show you don't need to have all these other illiterate

[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:34.320]
x-jocks in there. They're the problem. They all got started with Monday Night Football

[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:38.380]
as you know. The concept that it takes three people in a booth to be entertaining into

[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:41.520]
a ball game. It's a bunch of crap. And then when Jimmy decided to call it quitted to

[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.480]
coach he's going to get that job on Monday Night Football. Oh god. I ended up doing that.

[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.540]
Hank's been talking about that for the last couple months. Ever since Jimmy said he was

[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:52.820]
quittin then came back like 20 minutes later and Hank was saying that he already had

[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:58.320]
discussions with ABC and that if he leaves he's got the job. Great. But I'm wondering

[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.400]
if that game last night and I've seen it before in the air. What's a little runway between

[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:05.320]
the pictures of miles and home plate and the diamond back field? Yeah. You're watching.

[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:09.920]
It's just like it does. It's a dirt path. That's a throwback way back. If you ever see

[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.260]
any pictures from the real early days baseball they used to have that. I don't know what

[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:16.460]
the hell they would call that but I know what you're talking about. They really draw

[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:20.220]
it there though in Arizona. They really pack them in. I was recently in Vegas. I know

[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:24.740]
you've talked many times about the Rosewood Grill. I went by during the day trying to find

[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:28.040]
out what was up in it. It's very. There's no like grand entrance to that thing at all.

[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:33.320]
It's just like a little door on the side. I'm trying to find out what it's about because

[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:42.200]
I was just thinking about the steak and lobster. It's very expensive and it's okay. It's

[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.400]
very good but I still say if you want a great steak, which Chris has got to beat in

[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.760]
all the and there's two with Chris is out there. There's one on Sahara driving on the

[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:52.520]
other one. I stayed at New York, New York when I was out there and I spoke with the bartender.

[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:56.780]
One of the bartenders there as I was playing and he was saying that whether he's right

[01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:59.540]
or not, I don't know. He's like it's kind of a tourist trap that they don't treat them

[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:02.960]
not locals real good in there. Is that any experience that I would throw a grill?

[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:06.920]
I always had a great time in there. I ended up eating a Gallagher's in New York here,

[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:11.000]
which is an outstanding steakhouse. Not that you're ever going to be there but anybody's

[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.640]
going out there when it was real good. Real good experience at Gallagher's inside New

[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:18.720]
York, New York. Okay. And question for you. I just went back last night. I don't know

[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:23.280]
if anybody forwarded to you yet about parents who are stewing everybody in town because

[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.860]
they're so hot with the cold. That's ridiculous or what? He is a tragedy but forgot

[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:30.460]
to say so we'll have to get a truth. Well you know what that is though. That's the American

[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:35.640]
fucking way. Exactly. Have a good one. And back to you. Can beat that gator meat. So how

[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:40.060]
gator do you want to look today? Pretty gay. Like, flippant, raven gator just turned

[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:46.380]
gay. No, like really gay. Great. How gator do you want to look today? Come to gay cuts

[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:50.040]
and we'll give you the perfect hairdo to suit your alternative style. You want that

[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:54.140]
Tawki Beings look thing or the two layer thing around the back. No matter how gay you are,

[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:59.680]
gay cuts can fit your style. And don't forget to ask about our new specialty cuts too. From

[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:04.960]
back shavings to crack shavings, gay cuts will do it all. Yeah. The faster it just takes

[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:10.000]
my hairy ass. If you could do something about that, we'd both be really happy. Just

[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:17.700]
spend over and say, move for me. How gating you want to look today? Oh, I don't know. I'll

[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.760]
think about it. Well, this is a great book. You know something. This guy got screwed

[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:24.560]
over so bad here. Dave Halberstin. It makes me just my blood boil thinking about that

[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.640]
Michael Mayo. Hold the male. Oh, by the way, you know what to eat down there French fries

[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:36.600]
and Amsterdam? Mike Mayo. You you phony baloney. You piece of turd. I bet you got he popped

[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:40.500]
wood the day that here at Halberstin got canned by the heat. I bet you he was walking around

[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:46.080]
like with a Woody all day with Woody Grayboro. Sorry, Woody. I wouldn't wish that I wouldn't

[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:50.680]
be a Greybird or anybody else. Oh, there's John Sterling, one of the all-time worst, one

[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:55.140]
of the most bizarre, one of the most psychotic, one of the most unacceptable broadcasters

[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:58.000]
in the history of the human race. How do all these losers wind up in New York? That's

[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.400]
why I don't understand. They used to have all these great guys and now they wind up with

[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:11.220]
people like John Sterling and Fran Healy and the scooter and oh man, unacceptable. Even

[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:15.740]
Al Troutwick sounds good compared to some of these guys and he's pretty mediocre, eh? Old

[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:23.520]
Canadian. Here's Sunrise. Hello. Yes, sir. I remember Warner Wolf. Warner Wolf, who created

[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:27.760]
once go to the videotape. What do you mean you remember him? He's not still on?

[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:33.860]
Well, I was in that area, you know, it left in 1989. So I was up there for 15 years

[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:38.100]
and he was there when I got there. How come Warner Wolf isn't in this book? I think you

[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:41.960]
might be too recent as it is. Okay. Anyway, I call him by the way. He's still doing that.

[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:46.200]
Let's go to the videotape craft. Starting on ABC, local Western Channel 7, then he moved

[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:52.240]
to CBS, which is two. But that's what I remember. Now of course, I remember Bill Mauser. Yeah.

[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:57.280]
And started in Buffalo on WGR Buffalo. He used to do the Buffalo Visins baseball games.

[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:02.640]
Minor league baseball back in the 50s and then he went to WNBC in New York in 64 and

[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:08.720]
looks horrible by. He's still alive, isn't he? I actually remember watching baseball broadcasts

[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:13.180]
in Virginia at my grandfather's house in Red Barber doing the play by me. Right. And Mel Lowney.

[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:17.340]
Right. You know, early in the early days of... One of the most embarrassing moments of Red Barber's

[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:20.740]
career. He did it in between innings. They used to do those live Valentine spots. Remember

[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:24.540]
Valentine beer with a guest sponsor? And they had like in front of the broadcast booth, there were

[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:30.200]
these like flower, whatever you'd call it, like a wooden thing with flowers in it. And he got

[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.560]
done with a spot. He held it up to his lips like he was going to drink the beer and then he

[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.740]
poured the beer out into the flower pot and he didn't realize he was still on camera. Nice go on Red.

[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:43.040]
Remember the trademark for Valentine? Make the three rings sign? Sure. Yeah. The reason I call

[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.860]
basically was about the Akinz bars. And what was the beer that sponsored the Pirates Baseball?

[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:54.240]
Oh, wait a minute. Perhaps. No. Iron City. Which one? Iron City. What was a Pittsburgh? That was a

[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:58.680]
regional beer. Akinz bars. You know what you can get them. Please tell me. Okay. D-likes

[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:04.000]
Emporium and Jack Oranda. You know the ice cream store? What is it called? D-lites Emporium.

[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.040]
Jack Oranda? D-lites has a place in Jack Oranda. No, right where the new public says. Yeah.

[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:11.680]
Opps to the end of the parking lot and hops. What do you mean where the new public says? Yeah, they

[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:16.480]
built a brand new public that the opposite end of the parking lot from the old one and opened it up.

[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:20.700]
And it's more like a super public cut to Delhi and the snack bar and the whole nine out of bakery.

[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:28.100]
You're talking about Navhill and Cleary? No, no, no, no. Sunrise and university. Just right there at

[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:32.140]
Jack Oranda. They call it Jack Oranda Plaza. Oh, I know. You mean the place that was like all

[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:37.840]
torn apart? Right. Right. And there's a D-lites in there. They reinfigurated that whole

[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:42.340]
strip mall. They got a new bagel place there in party center. Right. Well that D-lites has them

[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:47.820]
and also sugar free marketplace. Oh, no. Oh, all of a sudden I'm starting to go into a coma.

[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:52.180]
Well, I mean, but I won't be going near there anytime soon. Well, it's out of the way though. Yeah, you're

[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:56.140]
right. It's not anywhere nearby. So I won't be here. He likes his best place because he's got them there. Okay,

[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:00.560]
thanks. Okay. Take care. Thanks. He didn't say sugar free marketplace. Did he say that?

[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:04.960]
Uh-huh. Oh, the place that's got all that stuff loaded with carbohydrates. Oh, he didn't say that.

[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:11.280]
Huh? Sugar free, but let's see. Let me say it again. I'm I said for the 10 minutes time. You do

[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.580]
whatever you want to do. Okay. It's a free world. I just give my advice based on my own personal

[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:18.940]
experience and believe me, especially after being to my hyperventilating doctor yesterday, I know my

[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:23.640]
crap. Okay. Even at the Eden Center in Toronto, they know my crap. They can feel smelly from Sunday.

[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:30.460]
What I mean, all of this low fat and sugar free. You look at the carbohydrates. If you're one of

[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:34.780]
those people that has a problem that's fat because you can't handle carbohydrates. And by the way,

[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:39.840]
somebody faxes me this information. Glue coats and fructose increase fat in the bloodstream.

[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:45.180]
See, some people think that if they don't eat refined sugar, that if they eat fructose, you see,

[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:50.440]
that's part of the propaganda from the health food nuts over the years. As a matter of fact,

[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:53.960]
some people say fructose is better for you because it doesn't cause the same rise in insulin

[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:58.780]
levels after meal. It says, which is important to diabetes. However, it seems to be particularly good

[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:05.240]
at raising triglycerides after a meal high in fat. So if you want to just keep ballooning up,

[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:09.360]
like DFO is in the morning and like the booster, just keep eating your substitutes.

[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.140]
Fructose and glucose and etc. and so on.

[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:20.580]
It says they did, they did, this is really interesting. They tested the fat levels in the blood of

[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:24.980]
22 subjects who on four different occasions consumed milkshakes made alternatively with no sugar,

[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:30.960]
fructose, glucose and aspirate, Nutrisuite. Fat levels were checked after fasting and before the

[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.900]
study participants drank the milkshakes, then every two to eight hours. Then every two hours for

[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:40.200]
our F-R-A-N-O. The investigators found the amount of fat absorbed from sugar sweetened shakes with

[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:45.560]
38 to 60 percent more than from the unsweetened or artificially sweetened shakes and that the fat

[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:49.820]
stayed in the bloodstream longer after the milkshakes were consumed. So the no sugar of any kind was

[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:55.360]
fine and also the Nutrisuite, the aspirate thing was fine. But the fructose and the glucose and

[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:03.880]
all these other things, cup of crap. I'm asking, did you see these facts? You don't seem anymore.

[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:08.060]
No, that's because it's right behind me. Now I get all the facts right. Well, there's one,

[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:12.240]
it's kind of interesting. Here's a stack. They say on the Atkins diet, a can of canfields,

[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:19.860]
diet, chocolate soda, in a big glass, add some ice, a couple of tablespoons of liquid whipping cream.

[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:25.940]
Liquid whipping cream? What does that mean? And top with either cool whip or whipped cream. Total

[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:33.120]
one carb. One carb. You can buy that chocolate soda for a long time. That's great. Canfield?

[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:37.880]
Yeah. Or a can of dyed root beer on the same is above total one carbs. It's the last

[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:42.700]
longer for either with the spoon and the shake too. Also pre-made meatballs in bag and microwaveable

[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:47.300]
available at Sam's Club, three pound bag zero carbs. It's Sam's Club. Well, they don't let me

[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.880]
get in there. It's what I write by my house there. Oh, they won't let me in there. Oh, it's

[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.580]
ham. No, I don't like the ham in there. So don't you have to have a card to get in the Sam's Club?

[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:59.880]
Huh? I think so. Yeah, well, I don't have no card. I only live like I could walk

[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:03.160]
from my house to there in 30 seconds. Oh, no, we don't want you. We don't like your kind.

[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:12.620]
And now a moment in black history with Raheeb Abdul Jabbar.

[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:18.940]
Maisie was a polo woman just barely getting by. And so to cook up some deadline in Ru-Bab one day,

[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:26.300]
Maisie laboriously squeezed corn cobs extracting the oil until she had enough to fry up her green.

[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:33.400]
Her overseas clearest Ola saw this and instructed Maisie to squeeze oil from corn all day long.

[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:38.260]
He viled it and sold it under the name Mazola Oil. Now what is up with that?

[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:44.040]
This has been another black history moment with Raheeb Abdul Jabbar.

[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:51.420]
Yeah, but one number to zero. Okay, it's 144.560 WQM. Here's the mobile and cross-brings. Hello.

[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.800]
Yeah, one of wolf's still on CBS. Right. That's what I said.

[01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:00.340]
In fact, I had a deal on TV a few months ago where he was going on one of his rancents and his teeth fell

[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:02.860]
out and flew with the camera. Yeah, right about that, right? Yeah.

[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.700]
Well, speaking about local boys that made it big in New York,

[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:11.560]
Boy Gary, remember him? No. Boy Gary. Boy Gary, he was our program director at IOD.

[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:15.120]
You don't mean Boy Gary from Howard Show, do you? No, I mean, he didn't mean from IOD.

[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:18.660]
Is that the same? I think two different people. No, same guy. Same guy. Same guy.

[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:22.020]
He's a real nerdy looking guy. Yeah, I miss was talking about him this morning.

[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.240]
He's given his opinion of radio people and he's scraped. Boy Gary is a single,

[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:32.320]
dumbest human being in radio. Absolutely correct. Right. That's it, Neil. I'm out of

[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:36.060]
low. I'll show you. Thanks. Okay. You don't think he was talking about the same? He might have been.

[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.680]
Of course, I guess he never meant any of these people here. 56670560,

[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:44.720]
Palm 560 on the AT&T line. In fact, in the Halberstown book, there is a picture of Don I'm

[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:49.260]
missing here from 20 years ago and he looks 110 in this picture. Man, some people are aged

[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:53.560]
gracefully. I mean, you know, getting old is not nature is evil because God, which you're

[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:57.660]
never do that. What do you? Oh, and that's another thing about my doctors for the yesterday's

[01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:01.420]
bizarre as it was. He kept coming in with the God and he used about four different occasions

[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:05.980]
to throw the God thing in there. Like, you know, we can debate about this now, but even though I know

[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:12.800]
you don't believe it, someday when we meet again, you know, you know, that stuff. You know, I'm talking

[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:17.420]
about. Yeah. Which have become highly offended by when the God people start throwing the God

[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:23.700]
stuff in my face. When I'm there to get a medical exam, it was a bizarre hour and a half. That's

[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:27.940]
all I can say, Dr. Mark, it was very strange. Of course, he probably doesn't remember it, but it was

[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:34.900]
very, very peculiar. It was very unusual. And I have a big, big, not somebody do that bad.

[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:38.260]
Not nearly like the one I had at that clinic. I want to mention the name of the place from

[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:44.620]
Cleveland. Where they had the big lump on my arm. I mean, sometimes, but people take blood and

[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:48.240]
they just find the vein. They hit it just right and you don't feel anything and they take

[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:52.360]
that they take the blood. They pull that needle out and you see there's not even like a pimple,

[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:57.180]
not a nothing. And other times they take it and it's like, boy, like there's a guy named Mountain

[01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:04.460]
growing on the inside of your elbow. Here's a lady mobile in Miami. Hello. Yes, ma'am.

[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:09.560]
Oh, boy. How long have they been holding? I'm sitting out in front of a client's house.

[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.220]
A long time, 29 minutes and 56 seconds. Blaine's George for that. How many of it on there this long?

[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:20.980]
I'm sitting in front of a client's house. 27, 23, 19. Hi, talk. Go ahead.

[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:23.900]
Okay. Yeah, you're in. Now you're interrupting her. She's trying to talk at the

[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:28.540]
Accepter on Hope for half an hour. You kept your own hold. No, I didn't. I take them in the order.

[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:33.500]
You put them on there. And I still can't talk. I'm sitting out in front of a client's house.

[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:36.440]
They keep looking through the window to see if I'm actually going to make it into the house.

[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:42.100]
But my battery died. So I had to step to the car and finish a couple of things.

[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:45.840]
First of all, when you're talking about Don, I'm just a second ago.

[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:50.560]
Did you ever see the movie Anaconda? No. Okay, John Boyd was in that movie.

[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:54.520]
And he, I must look a lot like John Boyd looked in that movie. It was really bad.

[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:57.680]
No, was I miss his brother Fred in that movie too? Because I noticed I miss his

[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:01.260]
never anywhere without Fred. I don't know. Maybe he was the snake.

[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.480]
Could have been. Did you, you have a hero, right? Yeah.

[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:09.180]
Turn to the local section, the death. There's a priest in there that died of AIDS.

[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:14.020]
Yeah. Did you see that? Is that the brown red section? No, the minispection.

[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:18.480]
Oh, I didn't get that. Okay. Well, I don't get it. Well, anyway, there's a priest in there.

[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:22.140]
It says he died of AIDS-related brain cancer. What a surprise.

[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:25.440]
A priest died of AIDS. A priest died of AIDS? There's no fact in the church.

[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.740]
Not only fact is good AIDS. I mean, that's a myth, you know.

[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:33.060]
None that I know. By the way, speaking of Miami, if anybody in Pinecrest ever wanted to-

[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.960]
There's no fact in the church. Yeah, we heard you.

[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:38.560]
Anybody in Miami ever thought about robbing a bank in Pinecrest?

[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:42.500]
This would be the time because all the cops are on Killian Dries giving out tickets for seating.

[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:46.800]
All right. Excellent. I talked to you actually a couple of weeks ago about the

[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:50.620]
Atkins bars. Right. And you made vomiting noises. Well, they're not-

[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:54.320]
I mean, you're not going to tell me you like them, but at least there's something to pacify you.

[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:58.700]
That's what I need is something to pacify me because let's face it, the Atkins died in

[01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:02.560]
of itself is so boring. It is so termically. That's very is that if you get so bored,

[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:08.160]
you won't eat that much. No. Some of the publics have them just like some of the

[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:12.560]
publics have the Tyson beef strips. In Miami, there's only one publics that I've ever seen that

[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:17.220]
has both of them and not a real great selection, but at least they have. So you had the Tyson

[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:21.220]
beef strips? Yeah. And they're good, aren't they? Yeah. And they also have the chicken strips too,

[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:24.640]
which are sort of like if you wanted to make a chicken seizure salad or something. Right.

[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:27.920]
Have it in the freezer or just some chicken- whatever, yeah. Whatever.

[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:34.260]
They also have Norman brothers. I know that's really fun. In Kendall. Yeah. You should be a

[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:36.900]
sponsor in my 100 years ago. I'm not going all the way down there. I love Norman brothers,

[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:41.040]
but I'm not going to Kendall for- You know, Atkins is going to be there at the end of this month,

[01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:45.260]
sometime $10. Well, he's having his big crews with Bob Leck in the Sunday. In fact, I've been

[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:48.520]
invited by 20 different people, including my doctorate, that he was also going to be on that

[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:53.960]
cruise to be there on Sunday. And I said- No. No. The last thing is you were talking about the same

[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:59.220]
time. I'm going to cruise. It won't be on a boat. Yes. I've been married 20 something years,

[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:03.760]
and when I was dating my husband who was- I'm Jewish. My husband at that time was a lap

[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:09.320]
statistical bowl. Now he's left everything. My father decided to take the two of us out to the

[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:15.080]
same house to stuff him full of Jewish food to see how he reacted. Right. He fell in love. He ate

[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:20.200]
the stuff. Durama, he ate things. The conditions he ate. He ate everything. My father was very

[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:24.460]
great. That was the best restaurant that was ever in this town. They used to get- they used to

[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:29.880]
cart you- had a complimentary wheelbarrow ride to the door after you were finished. Yeah, you need it.

[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:36.340]
Never walk. It was so good. And I remember when they sold it and tried to reopen it, I think a

[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:40.260]
couple of Cuban guys bought it. Well, Howard, I'm going to read Howard Climbers are a column about

[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:44.340]
it today, and he goes the whole history about the different attempts to reopen it in the names of

[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:48.240]
the guys and what they did to it and how they butchered it and destroyed it, etc. And it had the

[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:52.300]
rudest way to decide in New York. Right. It was just terrific. But that's because it was on the

[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:59.140]
beach. Well, yeah, that was the old beach before it was gentrified. Uh-huh. You know, all the- all the-

[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:05.340]
whenever the people with more money move in, they force everybody else out of the house. Exactly.

[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:09.740]
That's why all the synagogue are starting to close us by they're trying to combine on the beach.

[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:13.060]
Oh, that's why they're all moving to both here, right? They don't have any more people over there.

[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:16.480]
Okay, so they're- So listen, thank you. See if the thing is- I say. Okay, thank you.

[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:20.540]
Dinner at the famous. That was great food. Which is Howard Climbers. I'm going to read that in a few

[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:25.300]
minutes eventually. I'll get around to it. Great column. Nice going, Howie. See old parts like me and

[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:29.000]
Howard Climbers. We remember the days when this town was really something when we had on the beach.

[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.140]
You had picolos and needles there on Alton Road and you had the turf pub down there at the

[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:36.220]
foot of Saudi. Now what you got- I'm sure there's some of those restaurants that are good all

[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:41.540]
along the Veridenian. What you got is basically plastic. It's like, like I said, going to the

[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:46.040]
games, the people are plastic. The whole atmosphere, the phony atmosphere, the phony

[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:51.840]
enthusiasm. It's all plastic. On Southeast, that whole scene is plastic. In fact, it's a miracle

[01:21:51.840 --> 01:22:01.240]
they all don't melt in the hot floor of the sun. Plastic, phony, fake. God, that was that- and I'm

[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:06.400]
sure before I came here in 76. And it wasn't too much long after that. Maybe it was my fault.

[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:10.240]
That could have been it, huh? I don't think so. Was the early 80s. I don't want to mention who came in,

[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:16.040]
I don't want to mention those Marriolitos and that Marriol Boliv. Oh, you're a bad guy,

[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.960]
you're a communist, you're out of whatever you are. Right. Because I didn't want to see the

[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:23.300]
town turned into a toilet that made me into a bad guy. And a lot of other people, of course,

[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:26.080]
who can't talk about it now because they moved the hell out of here long gone.

[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.800]
Here's the lady in Miami. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, ma'am. I just wanted to say I was watching the

[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:36.880]
game Saturday night and I happened to agree with you. I was wondering why every time Toronto scored,

[01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:40.700]
no one cheered, no one stood up. Just me and some people down there in the

[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:45.060]
plane in the expensive seats. I couldn't see you because the seats that Jeff got you,

[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:48.700]
you were probably really high. I was hitting like way off. So I was so far up the camera couldn't

[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:53.180]
get that angle. I'm sure. But I was, I was, I was bleeds seats. Thanks a lot, Rimmer. No

[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:57.220]
is bleed. Oh, they're fibro is below. Yeah, fibro is below the ceiling is what they were. Yeah.

[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:01.980]
Exactly. And then last night I was watching the game and you know, Gensatoa and they were playing

[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:05.320]
all the same clips there. You can hear them in the background. The one where, you know, it's not over.

[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:09.900]
Right. And they were playing the Howard BLM. He says, I want you to get up right now and go to the

[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.880]
area. They cut it off. They won't let him see how much matter is held because there's little kids

[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:17.500]
in there and God forbid they should say, hell, so they cut it off and they go and say, let's go

[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:22.220]
to the center. And they play the same song. I mean, they play the same song over and over again.

[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:25.900]
See, like I said yesterday, Gary Batman, you and the people who are orchestrating this thing,

[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:29.960]
they're destroying the league. Ernie sport, they do it the same thing. You can go. And it's

[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:35.260]
getting to the point now where you can go to an arena in Miami, in Toronto, in Los Angeles,

[01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:41.340]
anywhere in America, North America. And the ambiance is all the same plastic crap. Same music, same

[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:48.060]
film clips on the screen, same Cornball crap. Yeah, I went to the old Maple Leaf Garden for the

[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:52.740]
first time back here. What a difference. Yeah. And you know, why go to the air canada center? I mean,

[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.200]
I go to the National Car Rental Center. It's the same thing, the United Center, all of them. You're

[01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:00.960]
right. They're exactly the same. You're right. Just like I said about the beach, plastic. Yeah,

[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:05.880]
well, I wouldn't go there and I live in Miami. I go to Fort Lauderdale or Orlando or wherever,

[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.520]
get out here. You know, where people speak English. Yeah, that's why I always go to the

[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:14.980]
Sawgrass. They speak a lot of English. All right, Neil. Take care. Have a great day. Okay. Bye.

[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:19.520]
Yeah, I could throw a brick from my house to the Sawgrass. I think I'm going to start doing it.

[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:24.840]
Huh, that's what I should normally start building it. Oh, there goes the neighborhood. Number two

[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:28.400]
tourist attraction in Florida. And you think I exaggerate when I tell you about a boring-ass

[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.560]
state this is. Number two tourist attraction in the state. It's a shopping mall.

[01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:38.300]
Without without even it doesn't even have a magnet store, you know. Doesn't have a bird

[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:43.800]
eye. Does it have a bird eye? No. Doesn't have like a, uh, nothing. Nases? No. No.

[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:51.440]
Penies. It's got like a penny's outlet store. You know, where all the people can't afford to

[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:55.860]
shop in a real penny's go. I don't want to mention the Sun thing. Huh? Do you ever go out of that

[01:24:55.860 --> 01:25:04.540]
penny's outlet mall? No. Sparkers. What? What? It's like basketball. Basketball,

[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:08.920]
basketball, NBA basketballs for black people and the same thing with that JC Penies Outlet store.

[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:14.440]
Black people shopping there. And once in a while, me. Which I don't mind shopping in there,

[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:19.240]
you know. Maybe I should start going. Yeah, you should go in there. You got a little, uh,

[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:23.840]
in you. Okay, where are we going? Here's a mobile implantation. Hello.

[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:29.340]
Hey, how you doing? Pretty good, sir. Yeah, I'm the first time caller. Great. And I was

[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:33.100]
in, I wanted to say a little story. It was over in public the other day. And I was at the pharmacy.

[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:38.220]
And on the, at the counter, at the counter on the pharmacy was something called a diabetic bar.

[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:44.400]
I'm gonna be ever seen that. A diabetic bar? Yes. What a happy time. Is that a car? Is that a

[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.740]
car that diabetic skewed? Right. And the finalized diabetic said I decided to pick it up. Turn over

[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:52.820]
to the other side and look at the Carbohydrates. There was about 18 grams of sugar in it.

[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:58.940]
Yeah. And this must be for diabetes. How do you like that? And I went out to Tonya. They're killing

[01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:03.580]
people every day with this crap, with this garbage. And I asked the pharmacist. I said, you know,

[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:06.940]
how can you go ahead and put something like this out there? She's like, oh, I know. I looked at

[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:11.300]
the same thing. I don't even know. You didn't even know. Because they're in the selling crap. That's

[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:16.960]
what it's all about. America loves to buy. I guess that's what it is. Yes, sir. Well, thanks a lot.

[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:23.680]
And I appreciate it. And have a great life. Bye. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:27.800]
Where am I going to get those guys? I thought probably would already been in here by now. I've

[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:33.980]
lost it with a big bag full of that crap. And it is crap. But it, you know, at least it's something.

[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:41.220]
I'm sorry. You know, I'm all for the Atkins diet. And they know stakes and lobster and shrimp and

[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:47.260]
omelette. But how much stake and lobster and shrimp you want something else? God, and I don't want

[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:51.640]
cheesecake. If I ever hear anybody say the word cheesecake, I'm going to have another accident

[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:59.700]
in my pants. Okay. I don't want any more goddamn cheesecake. Christ. You know what cheesecake is like

[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:07.040]
cheesecake is like a cake made out of hollava. It's like dry. It's like tasteless. It's a crap is what

[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:13.660]
it is. You're going to have cake. Have a nice, a big moist, uh, Betty Crocker, a double-fudge

[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:18.140]
thick cake. There you go. If you're going to have cake, which I can't have that. But that's a cake.

[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:24.260]
You're going to have a pie. Go to Denys and go out of those mother uh, Hubbard's. Now what they

[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:31.200]
have? Mother uh, your mama pies? No, boy. I'll tell you Denys is not exactly my favorite place. But

[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:39.100]
boy, those mother hummer pies. Mm-mm-mm. The best. They'd like that chocolate cream pie and Boston

[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:45.260]
cream pie. See, why am I doing this now? What is wrong with me? Huh? I'm losing my mind now with

[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:51.820]
this crap. Get the honey, Junior. I can't see you in my tummy. I'm going to have a

[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:57.780]
tail. Lanny's asked America what they want. They didn't all you can eat breakfast.

[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:03.580]
There's a lot of food. A lot of choices. Bacon pancakes and eggs. Any way I want them.

[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:07.360]
Oh, and sausages. Those little sausages that look like dog chips. Yeah, the ones that always

[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:11.360]
come stuck together. Why is that? They don't want to warm them. They're a heat lamp at some fast

[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:15.760]
food place. I want to warm them during heat lamp at Lanny's. Tell you how I want it. I want bacon

[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:19.740]
really fatty and lean so that when you pick it up, you sort of doops off your finger and eggs with

[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:24.160]
the yolk broken so they're hot as they're rock. And I want it served by a fat, swollen waitress

[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:28.420]
or the mustache so I am an excuse to stiffer. Hey, where are you going? Back down.

[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:33.660]
Hey, don't want to stand in line. I want to wait in line to get seated for a really long time.

[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.440]
They do that at Denys. Lenny. Lenny. America, there's a new. All you can eat,

[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:43.860]
grand slam breakfast venue. Ed Lenny's. It's everything you already expect from Lenny's.

[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:48.740]
Just a lot more of it at room temperature. Why should you love those mother humpur pies,

[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:51.500]
though? 1202 at 560 W.M. Howard Kleinberg writes,

[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:55.000]
dinner at the famous that was great food, which I can only say.

[01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:59.800]
After they can fill the fish in the chop after the chop liver and after the chicken soup with

[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:03.600]
three lots of balls and egg noodles, I pulled back from the Passover Seder table and thought,

[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:07.260]
just as I do every year, I'm stuffed. I'd like to opt for the skeleton dinner.

[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:12.180]
The skeleton dinner appetizer soup dessert, but no main course was in my memory,

[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:16.000]
born at what it was once. One of Miami Beach's most famous restaurants and appropriately

[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:21.620]
called the famous. A 1977 Miami-Hold Restaurant reviewer referred to the famous

[01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:26.180]
the skeleton dinner as an escape hatch with everything else being shoved onto the table who

[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:31.860]
needed a main course. The restaurant at 671 Washington Avenue was founded in 1945 by Morris

[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:37.980]
Learner. The site has a history. In 1934 was the tiptoe bar in Grill. In 1937 it was

[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:43.060]
Lehman's Restaurant and beginning in 1938 it was a restaurant operated by Oscar and Esther Bernstein.

[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:49.280]
The famous under several owners had a lifespan of 36 years. It died in 1981, a victim of the

[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:55.240]
evolving demographics of South Beach. Plus a change in people's eating habits, heavy food was on the

[01:29:55.240 --> 01:30:00.620]
way out, salads and fluff were in control. Those of us still around who patronize the famous will

[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:05.260]
recall how immediately upon being seated the cold slaw, pickles, sauerkraut and several kinds of

[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:10.140]
bread were put on the table, followed by a bottle of seltzer and upon request a chocolate syrup

[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:14.980]
for a make-your-own drink of New York origin. While nibbling and drinking you then face the crisis,

[01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:19.600]
you order a full meal or just the skeleton dinner. Knowing the appetizers on the skeleton dinner

[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:24.200]
included items such as stuffed durma, conishes and all those other exotic but filling Eastern European

[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:29.220]
Jewish foods and also knowing that the soup was to follow chicken soup with matsu balls or noodles

[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:32.500]
according to the menu, though usually you got chicken soup with matsu balls and noodles,

[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:37.140]
you thought twice about a main course. How much can you eat? After the soup wants to look at a

[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:41.440]
boiled beef flakkin or stuffed cabbage, oh god did they have good stuffed cabbage? Briscuit or

[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:46.980]
beef or a pastrami style smoked duck, so you opted for the skeleton dinner. Sometimes if you're

[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:50.500]
already at order the main course but were real nice, a waiter or waitress would let you off the hook

[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:55.000]
when you pleaded you could eat no more. The order was rewritten as a skeleton dinner and as a reward

[01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.200]
you provided a little extra in the tip. Learner sold the restaurant in 1964 to Harry Zuckerman

[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:04.660]
who later sold it to his son Ira and son in La Lary Winkler. Winkler eventually bought out

[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:10.120]
our Zuckerman share. But things were changing for the famous. When I hosted my parents' 50th wedding

[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:15.360]
anniversary dinner with the famous in 1980, the number of patrons was already declining. Neither the

[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:21.320]
Maryl influx nor the Art Deco South Beach movement lent itself to chopped liver matsu balls and

[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:26.680]
pickled tomatoes. In April 1981, Winkler closed the restaurant, claiming that he would reopen in

[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:31.540]
November. Before that however, he leased the business to Juan Fevoli and Eric Velasco, Cuban

[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:37.000]
Americans who opened the Corsair in Ocean who owned a Corsair in Ocean Haven hotels. The new owners

[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.600]
reopened in December kept some of the old ethnic menu but served lobster bisque instead of chicken

[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:48.380]
soup. Perrier instead of shelter. They couldn't make a go of it and shut down. I remember that. I

[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:55.500]
went there when they reopened and I went oh my god. Yeah. In August 1984, the famous reopened as a

[01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:59.020]
gay nightclub and restaurant and again the menu was modified. This time they were

[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:03.500]
foods Spanish and Italian foods. In addition to American style food, this too had a short life.

[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:08.060]
While the strange of the edition may be gone, the building hosts the vibrant establishment today

[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:12.880]
in 1985. It opened as the strange still want to stop beaches popular late night spots.

[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:20.400]
Nevertheless, the ghost of Hungarian goulash. Oh, the best. The memories of skeleton dinners

[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:25.720]
and the groans of overeaters permeate the air. As the Harold headline of 1981 reminds us,

[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:28.720]
the famous is gone but the heartburn lingers on.

[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:37.540]
Nice gone Howard. Oh god was that a place huh? And now they got all that plastic crap down there.

[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:45.060]
All those phony drug addicts, posers, silly, uh, simple and queens. People like Mickey

[01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:52.400]
work desperate for attention. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line. Here's my

[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:56.940]
knee beat. Hello. Any how you know what? Great. Listen, two names that I don't know if you mentioned

[01:32:56.940 --> 01:33:02.140]
Dolce Edward to build the big whistle and Salmucina. Salmucina I mentioned that's uh.

[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:07.180]
Chadwick was a former referee that they put in the box with the booth with Jim Gordon.

[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:11.460]
Is that he's in here? He's in the book. I'm looking in the uh in the index. Let's see.

[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:14.760]
Also listen, never mind the acting. I can't understand why you don't have a struggle with

[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:19.080]
into some of these calls. Do you remember Jerry Eisenberg? Jerry Eisenberg was never on the radio,

[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:22.500]
sir. He was a newspaper guy. Here's Bill Chadwick's picture, by the way. It says,

[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:28.540]
follow the arrangers and the nicks on WHN. Here, Marv Albert, every morning during the Jack Sterling show.

[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:33.440]
That's right. And here's a picture of a Bill Chadwick. Also, Vince Scully is a little

[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:38.220]
poppest, but he is magnificent doing radio. You haven't lived until you've you know been in the

[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:43.320]
car listening to him on the radio. He's fantastic. Yeah. Well, he's good. You got to be good. He's

[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:46.420]
easier, better than most of the crap you get around. In fact, most of the broadcasts today on

[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:50.080]
these days since everything's on Fox now. Yeah. You can't tell one announcer from the other.

[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:54.040]
They all sound the same. That's true. And the guy that does the Indians, this Jack Somers, I think

[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:58.200]
his name is this man. You, you, you, while you're listening to him, you want to poke him in the

[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:02.380]
ribs and see if you can wake him up. Here's the most coma toast man I've ever heard in my life.

[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:06.660]
You know, here's a funny, they play with the audio Fox. They raise up the crowd sound in the stadium

[01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:10.740]
so that people kind of get more excited about it. It kind of, it covers up any of the imperfections

[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:14.500]
that the announces may have. Would your ought to be a lacrod must be wild then. I'm telling you two

[01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:18.820]
other things. Yes. New York Post is reporting that Wayne Gretzky absolutely will retire at the end

[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:23.320]
of the season. They say the sources are impeachable. Oh, John Davidson's been spending the room for a week.

[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:27.720]
Got enough with him already. Have a nice life. Land we had enough of you already. Okay. Need a

[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:31.880]
little nice season too, by the way. No question. And also you are the king of the panthers. There

[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:37.040]
is no questions. Please tell all our loyal viewer listeners that the injuries are not the reason

[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:41.460]
why this team did not make the playoffs. I listened to Eddie Capil last night. I wanted to puke

[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:47.000]
with his rose colors. Well, the injuries, you know, when pop will go. They're the reason that the

[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.920]
team didn't make the play on. Exactly what he said last night. You could see that this team has

[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:55.060]
heart and character. They won last night. That's the thing they want to game after an eight game

[01:34:55.060 --> 01:35:00.040]
winlis. They have seven losses in a tie, including losses to the islanders and two to the Washington

[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:04.260]
Crapidl. And he said because of the rash of injuries and you know, with burrigating her and then

[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:09.440]
the rash of injuries, that's what kept this team out of the playoffs. I wanted a puke. This team

[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:14.540]
is comor inducing their parables. I'm going to tell you if you took Ray Whitney and Mark Parrish,

[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:18.480]
you're away from this team, and you took away the fact that we've had pretty better than expected

[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.920]
gold tending from Sean Burke and Kirk McLean earlier. Better than we had a right to expect.

[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:25.300]
You take away those two factors. This team would have been right there with the lightning.

[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:28.420]
Oh, there's no question. Do you think Parrish is going to be a 25 goal scorer?

[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:30.760]
He's every year. He's a good player. He knows how to fight.

[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:34.280]
You know something that you know, it's interesting. Remember this was the organization that kept saying

[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:38.020]
when they got rid of Stu Barnes and Strachan, they didn't like little guys. Take a look at who

[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:41.840]
the three best people for getting about burrig because you only played a few games. The three most

[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:45.860]
prolific scores on his team were Whitney, Mark Parrish, and if he wouldn't have been injured,

[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:50.440]
Dino sister Reli, three little guys. There you go, Brian. Stick that way to Moonbone.

[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:54.320]
You remember when Terry Murray said that my team choked in the playoffs and Lingeries went crazy

[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:59.120]
and the Stanley Cup finals? Yeah. Well, him saying, and he said this, that the nails in the

[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:02.680]
coffin were eliminated already, even though they weren't eliminated, I think he's going to come back

[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:07.040]
to bite him in the ass because a lot of the players really were not very happy with that statement.

[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:10.780]
But you know what the spokesman said there was Rimmer last night on the pregame show. The spokesman

[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:14.180]
says, or maybe it was between period, the spokesman says, well, the highlights for me,

[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:18.920]
the good thing this year's been a coaching and the consistency. Yeah, they've been consistent.

[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:22.480]
I'll write consistently crap. Good luck doing the games next year. I'll be great to hear you.

[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:25.760]
Thanks a lot. Okay. I'm going to be doing the Panther games next year. Amble believe that?

[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:31.740]
Believe it? No. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60, on the mobile one. I mean, I can't be no Christina

[01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:35.960]
more, you know. I can't say dumps down often enough. That was the only thing he ever said.

[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:40.340]
Dumps down, dumps down. That's why I didn't Toronto Sunday. Dump down straight down my pants.

[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:46.860]
4th Fact Radio WQL

[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:55.480]
Place remain on the line. A customer care representative will be with you momentarily.

[01:36:55.740 --> 01:37:00.480]
We apologize for the delay. On hold messages. You're always annoying and never truthful.

[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:03.960]
When they say momentarily, how many tens of minutes are they talking about?

[01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:09.040]
Well, if you order star FU from Big Bell, you can know simply dial star FU

[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:13.320]
at the end of the hold message and then learn the truth. And we apologize for the delay.

[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:19.920]
Your delay will be approximately 79 minutes. We see the line ringing, but are too busy with our

[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:26.840]
takeout pizza to answer it. And you are not a valued customer. Star FU from Big Bell.

[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:32.960]
A service you wish really did exist order today. Yeah, NFU too. 1215. Yeah, don't you love that

[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:37.020]
best of New Zealand. It's not only these, you know, like the, every time I call one of these places

[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:41.160]
where they have the computerized stuff, I feel like I'm on the Phil Henry show again. Time warp.

[01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:45.720]
Put the phone on the floor. Stick your foot in your rectum. Punch the button, you know,

[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:50.720]
press one. But now the new deal is like when you call one of these travel service things where you

[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:57.840]
make reservations. Your expected wait time is 82 minutes. Yeah, well, what is that? Who the hell in

[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:01.660]
their right mind is going to hold on for like 17 minutes and 25 minutes? What does that mean?

[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:06.440]
In addition to which, how do they know what your anticipated wait time is? You know what I'm saying?

[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:11.480]
They're going to think like we got here. What do you mean by that? Like they just look at the

[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:16.440]
longest row of person waiting and that's the number. Well, but that doesn't mean anything. I mean,

[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:20.100]
maybe they had somebody that took 50 minutes to do their reservation. The next five people might

[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:28.000]
take two minutes or might take an hour. It's a guest in it. Thanks. And FU. 56670560.

[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:32.040]
Pound 560 on a mobile one line. Yeah, I would really recommend a spare, I guess only if you're from

[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:36.140]
New York or maybe if you're a sports band, but we don't have any of those down here. If you're from

[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:39.960]
New York, you really enjoy a hell of a day that helps us. The book sports on New York Radio will

[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:45.480]
play by play history, which I just got this copy up today. Here's Al Helfer. Remember Al Helfer?

[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:49.660]
No. Broadcast five World Series beginning 1951 on mutual's game of the day broadcasts.

[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:57.580]
Walt Frazier. Oh, geez. Good player. But oh, Jerry Coleman. Oh, my God. That was the beginning of

[01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:01.340]
the end when they brought in Jerry Coleman and the scooter and Joe Dodg-Jola always in literate

[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:05.820]
to X-Jocks. That was the beginning of the end. But this is a really good book. It's a lot of good

[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:11.320]
crappin' it. 56670560. Pound 560 on the AT&T line. Here's Pemberpine. Hello.

[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:18.520]
Neil? Yes, sir. Just a few capsule comments. I speak to you when you have a guy named Nick

[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:23.100]
Kodew of every day. That's how long I've been listening to you. Do you remember that? Yes. Okay.

[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:29.100]
capsule comment. Did they say anything about Bill Stern? He had a wooden leg.

[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:32.900]
He's here. Of course he's in here. I'm sure that I don't even have to look. He did the first

[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:39.140]
telecast on the Giants versus the Codinal game. There's tons of stuff on Bill Stern. There's a whole

[01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:44.960]
chapter in this book on Bill Stern. Page 54 or whatever. He was a fight. He did the Gillette.

[01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:50.420]
What do they call that? I know he did the college games on radio and then he did the first Giants

[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:56.520]
versus Codinal game. Bill Stern was born Bill Stern gold in Rochester, New York in 1907. There's a

[01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:02.720]
whole thing on him here. Is that well? He had a great voice and he had a wooden leg, didn't he? Yes.

[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:08.000]
And that's okay. That's it. I think he was the same wooden leg that Bill Cullen used later on.

[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:13.100]
Well anyway, I have to get it off because that last grip I think just meant that the wax might

[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:18.160]
use... Oh, you did it again. Okay. See you in the last. Okay. One call left on the board. See,

[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:21.480]
I read Howard Conber's thing about the famous and they're saying, what's that? What's that?

[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:27.800]
Too bad it was great. All of us old parts that have been around here long enough to appreciate when

[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:34.520]
it was really great. We know what it was all about. 567-0560, 05-60 on the mobile one month. I can play that,

[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:38.660]
play by playing a radio thing over and over again while we figure out what we want to eat today. See,

[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:42.200]
I would love to have meatballs, but I can't eat the meatballs with the breadcrumbs. Did you call

[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:45.200]
over there and find out if they put breadcrumbs in their meatballs over across the street? No.

[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:51.860]
Well, why don't we find out while I answer the phone? Nobody's a QAM? Sure. Yes, sir. Does Neil want the

[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:56.240]
Atkins bars or not? Yes. Okay. I mean, you keep disconnecting and I'm trying to tell you exactly

[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:00.920]
where you can get them right near you. Yeah. All right. George keeps disconnecting you. Somebody told

[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:04.700]
I'm sorry. The mobile phone is bad. Oh, you have a bad ear in the back. Yeah, a lot because I'm in

[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:08.880]
up to the center. I'm in a bad cell. Okay, just forget about that. Let's do the... Yeah. Yeah.

[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:15.100]
Publix, you can get the Atkins bars, plus sweet and low no sugar cake mixes if you're so in

[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:20.680]
kind of a base. Yeah. If your public doesn't have the bars or... I scoured my publisher. I was

[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:24.460]
going to... I was popping down every aisle. I was in the back. I was out in the front. I was looking

[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:28.040]
in the mailbox. Couldn't find them. Look near the health food section. I looked at the health food

[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:31.800]
section. I looked in the diet food section. I looked at the fat food section. I looked in the

[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:35.560]
candy section. I looked everywhere. I just put them in a public class week. I worked for the

[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:39.480]
distributor. Yeah. I asked you, man. Tell which public. Now I'm not going to go through all of

[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:43.500]
them. Just tell your manager to get them from fine distributing and he can get you the advantage

[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:48.620]
bars that you want. Right. Okay. There's the chocolate mac, the peanut and the almond. Oh, the peanut one.

[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.580]
Not that one. I want the chocolate mac. Yeah. Well, that's what they got. Right.

[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:57.900]
I've got them in the public right now. It's a... I remember I parked my in Pond. Well, how about the

[01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:05.080]
publics out there by me by the song race? That's a bit... It's very possible. I don't know. What's

[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:09.320]
that people out by me? We need them desperately. I mentioned it to the manager. He can get them from fine.

[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:13.860]
Okay. Okay. Fine. Great day. Okay. Well, he's giving himself a little pre-plug. What's wrong with that?

[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:22.740]
Well, we already know that. Uh-oh. Oh, I had a good sneeze come out there and couldn't

[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:29.660]
I had to repress it. Nobody to QAM. He's your age. Okay. Nobody to QAM. Last call today. This is it.

[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:34.600]
Neil. Yes, sir. Did you get that soda recipe that facts you?

[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:40.380]
Yes. You got to do that, man. Okay. It'll keep you in there. Okay. Thank you. I got it. I read it. I talked

[01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:45.120]
about on here. I got it. Okay. Don't be chronic. Okay. Don't be a cronus. Is that a cornice?

[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:51.300]
Don't be a cornhole. What? So they don't make to meat balls there. They, uh, purchase them and yes,

[01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:57.060]
they do have... See, how many... How many months have I been eating, man? Months. Months and months

[01:42:57.060 --> 01:43:03.860]
and months. I've been eating stuff with bread crumbs in it. God damn it. And I'm wondering how come I go

[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:08.160]
home after eating what I think is a perfect heck in lunch and my blood sugar is like 180 when it

[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:17.240]
ought to be like 80 or 90 or something. All these hidden... All the hidden stuff that they put in the

[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:20.580]
foods that you eat that you never have. You know what I'm saying? All of these things that are

[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:24.460]
in there that have no reason to be in there. I don't care if my balls are soft and mushy or if

[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:29.600]
they're firm. Okay. I do like my muttaballs firm. So like when you take your spoon, you know,

[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:33.840]
chop off a piece and it hangs to the back of the spoon. That's the way muttaballs ought to be.

[01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:40.400]
Hard. 5, 6, 7. Is this going to be the end now? We've been smoking along here. I read the thing

[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:45.440]
from out the famous there and it was out of killer. Thanks Howard. That was a great column. I love

[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:50.180]
that. Brought back great memories to all of Soul Starts. And the rest of these people, they're all gone.

[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:58.320]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line. Every another day of my life, it's not bad enough.

[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:03.220]
I had a psychotic episode for an hour and a half yesterday with a doctor. In fact, I used that word

[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:06.800]
when I walked in the yesterday and said, yeah, you're a little psychotic today. Little did I know.

[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:10.060]
A little psychotic was an understatement. A wild man.

[01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:18.320]
Wound up like an alarm clock. Here's a mobile in western hell.

[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:23.420]
Now what's going on here now? That's the second time in the last a few minutes. Are we having

[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:28.080]
are we having another dingling on the phone here today? Is that it? Are they touching you

[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:31.900]
around with the phone because we've been doing just fine up till about five minutes ago. And now I get

[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:36.140]
two of those sounds on there like the phone company is screwing around with our phone lines again.

[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:41.180]
Wouldn't surprise me. Here's a mobile in west Palm Beach. Hello.

[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:48.680]
How you doing, Neil? Okay, so I got some information for you on that diet, dietetic to far.

[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:56.640]
What is for is when you monitor your sugar, it goes low, goes down, and you need a pickup.

[01:44:57.180 --> 01:45:01.000]
So it's like, sure, that's the most ridiculous thing in my life of pickup. That's what makes you

[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:04.820]
hyperglacient if you don't want to pick up that. You can go get a candy bar if you want to pick up.

[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:08.620]
That's not what you want. No, no. A lot of times if you don't, if you don't monitor your blood

[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:15.500]
right, your blood sugar goes down and you, and you start going getting, you know, you got, did you

[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:19.900]
see Godfather three? So you have a little glass of orange juice about a third of a glass of orange juice.

[01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:24.360]
Exactly right. You have a little piece of hard candy with sugar in it. You don't go get a can. A bar

[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:29.620]
that's got 35 or 50 or 60 grams of carbohydrates in it. So your blood sugar goes up to 200 because

[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:35.120]
those big swings up and down is what's going to kill you. It's given them a variety though. That's

[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:39.720]
what it does. Sure, let me say it again. It's the first thing you can keep pumping it all you

[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:45.140]
want, sir. Let me say it again. Those bars should not be consumed by people who are diabetic or

[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:51.020]
hyperglacemic or both of the above. Got it? Does he got it? No, no, we don't got it because he doesn't

[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:56.980]
want to listen to what I'm saying. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, the y'all keep plugging away here now.

[01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:01.700]
Totally paranoid now since you're in those two awful sounds there from the phone company.

[01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:06.320]
Everything's been working fine for a couple of weeks now. Why can't they just leave the phones

[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:11.500]
alone? Why can't we just go like a month would be nice with a phone system that works here?

[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:17.840]
Coral Springs, hello? Because Bob Bell wants to show you his boss. That's why. Is that it?

[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:23.540]
Listen, when you went to see Dr. Mark, did you find out what Norvast? I remember somebody called

[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:28.100]
last week about the Norvast. About what? Norvast? Never heard of it. And he said,

[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:36.020]
he asked Norcross. He told you that NORVASC. No. Only got as far as the NO part.

[01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:42.080]
Okay, listen, I'm the guy that calls that was 600 pounds now. Okay great, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:48.780]
0.5, 60 on the mobile one line. One call left on the board. Are they working? Is this going working?

[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:51.640]
Is this... Hello?

[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:58.500]
You know something, here we are again, boys and girls. Welcome to Bell South of Atts Best.

[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:02.920]
Okay, the one line I got the howling sound, the next guy there's a guy on there and it doesn't ring.

[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:07.360]
Okay, we got a little phone problem here today, boys and girls. You know, I don't know how many times

[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:11.360]
over the 23 years I've been in this market. I've been on a year of screaming and yelling and

[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:17.820]
working with a phone system that doesn't work. What about what am I wasting all this energy for?

[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:24.240]
I'm sitting here, probably eating the audience, getting them all psychotic and we got a phone

[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.780]
system that's all F'd up here. What's going on in this building? Is somebody out there the other

[01:47:28.780 --> 01:47:36.440]
thing? Nope. Then it's Bell South again. Well, let's just say F you to Bell South, okay?

[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:46.900]
Hello? What was that? That must be Bell South. Hello?

[01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:48.840]
Yeah, Neil. Hold on.

[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:01.240]
Okay, line 8.

[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:09.800]
We have a phone system that doesn't work. That's all totally, that just about 10 minutes ago,

[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:15.680]
just totally blew up. This went nuts. The miracles, the wonders of Bell South. You know something

[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:19.940]
I'm going to say it again. You people at Bell South, you should croak. You should die a wicked,

[01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:27.040]
nasty, rotten, filthy, grotesque death. That even the maggots wouldn't touch your rotting bodies, okay?

[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:32.940]
Day after day, week after week, year after year. I see you're wondering, am I going to get through

[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:37.380]
four hours today with a phone at my work? Forget about what they'll try to call or not. That's another story.

[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:59.740]
You crazy bastard, you. Neil? God? Oh, doctor! It's time to play you, make the call!

[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:05.240]
You're getting a lap dance from a large chested striper of casual moral fiber and marginal until I

[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:11.500]
invite you up to her hotel room after her shift, but you're a married man. What do you do? Should you?

[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:17.100]
Take your wedding ring, hide it in your pocket and do her five ways to Sunday. Only go to third,

[01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:22.740]
which in some religions is technically not cheating or feely, graciously declined. Then go home

[01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:27.080]
and fantasize about her while banging your wife, but tell all your friends you nailed her anyway.

[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:30.740]
You make the call! The answer when we return.

[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:37.740]
Welcome back to you, make the call. You're getting a lap dance from a large chested stripper

[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:42.200]
of casual moral fiber and marginal until I to invite you up to her hotel room after her shift,

[01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:48.820]
but you're a married man. What do you do? If you pick she, graciously decline her invitation,

[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:53.060]
then go home and fantasize about her while banging your wife and tell all your friends you nailed her

[01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:57.860]
anyway. You win! You make the right choice. Join us next time for another

[01:49:57.860 --> 01:50:01.000]
Rhythm Edition of You Make the Call!

[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.240]
1232-560 WDQMOT started out for over a couple of hours as being an almost deliverable Tuesday,

[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:11.160]
and now it's turned into living hell. WDQA-M, hello. Yes, I'd like to speak to Neil Rogers, please.

[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:16.920]
Speaking sir. Neil, how you like that? All right, hold on. Hold on. Try it again. Hello.

[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:21.600]
Neil? Can you hear me? I hear you, but the final answer is up. I move to you all the time.

[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:28.760]
And you're older than you. And a while back you had a problem with the hill on your foot.

[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:33.240]
With the one? With your heel? You went through all that stuff back.

[01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:36.540]
A bone spree? A heel spree, yes. How did you get that corrected?

[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:40.060]
How did I get it corrected it went away? Oh, it just went away by itself?

[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:43.240]
It took nine months. That's right. And this phone has screwed up and have a great day. Okay.

[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:47.600]
It's the doctor's show. Okay, I mean, it doesn't make any difference that the phone is

[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:50.700]
working or not because there's nobody calling out. Anyway, we've got a couple people on there.

[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:57.140]
And this guy wants medical advice. 567-0560. I mean, you talk about going from heaven to hell in like

[01:50:57.140 --> 01:51:05.960]
10 seconds, baby. This town will do it to you immediately if not sooner. 567-0560,

[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:09.480]
pound 567 on the mobile one line. Do we have anybody alive out there today? No.

[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:13.480]
Anybody breathing? No. Anybody still out there that can communicate? No. Anybody that can speak?

[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:15.500]
W-D-Q-I-M.

[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:18.000]
Anybody in mobile? Speak me out.

[01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:23.360]
Speaking. Hey, how are you, sir? Okay. Can you explain to me why a lot better 20 minutes ago?

[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:26.460]
This sounds like one of our chronics. No, I'm not a chronicle. I've never called before.

[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:31.660]
Okay, good. I was listening to Tom White's... Yeah. Why did he have a syndicated radio show when you don't?

[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:34.540]
I haven't got any idea because he wears a better jacket. I don't know.

[01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:37.280]
And I remember when he was down here, he was pathetic.

[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:40.380]
And he still pathetic. He's a joke. He's an industry joke.

[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:45.840]
And, you know, listening to him was torture. Yeah. Absolutely torture.

[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:49.460]
But anyway, he wanted to call it to find out why you're not...

[01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:53.680]
Because unfortunately, I've never been surrounded by people who have any interest in syndicating this program.

[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.520]
I've heard a lot of talk, a lot of bop bop bop bop bop and nothing ever happens, okay?

[01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:01.140]
Well, I think you should do it. I think you're wonderful. Okay, thank you so much. God bless you.

[01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:08.120]
567-0560, pound 567-0560 on the mobile one line. Somebody just pulled the plug on the phone and on the audience.

[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:13.140]
Oh, you're like that. I bet you can't throw it on it. I bet you're an inside god damn job.

[01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:19.540]
I'm going to tell you again when I hear... See, I can get paranoid. I can get all kind of psychotic behavior.

[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:24.940]
Like, my doctor was yesterday. But when I hear those howling sounds, I know for sure that somebody

[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:28.460]
there had bell-soft again is playing fast and loose with my life.

[01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:33.580]
You've heard of the Wichita alignment? Well, we got the South Florida alignment who's

[01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:37.740]
poaching around out there. Whenever the hell they feel like it. They're yanking, they're pulling,

[01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:43.620]
they're pushing it. They're squeezing it. Here's Pemberg Pine. Tell them.

[01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:49.080]
Neil, how you doing today? I'm doing okay. I can see that. I wanted to read something about a couple

[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:54.080]
weeks ago. It was a morning that called you. They said, you know, you don't go anywhere

[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:59.100]
going to you to the Wichita regal. And he said, everybody's got Naples. Yes. Now, there is no

[01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:03.600]
one of the fuckies because I am from there. And it's not really as terrible as you think it is.

[01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:08.800]
You've been there? No. Why can you be there? But 10 million tourists can't all be wrong. I mean,

[01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:12.480]
everybody I've ever strove into said Naples is nothing but a bunch of shluppers. There's tremendous

[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:16.940]
poverty there. There's tremendous crime. As many gypsies there are in Rome. There's 50,000 more in

[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:20.460]
the Naples. I think that the gypsies are the more than what you got. Including in Amsterdam. I just

[01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:24.080]
live in Rotterdam for three and a half years. I know Amsterdam also pretty good. I never saw

[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:29.240]
gypsies in Amsterdam. Never. And then you've got to be looking a little bit more specific next time.

[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:34.200]
You go there. I'll make sure I look for some. Absolutely. But you know, I will suggest that you go

[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:37.080]
there before you even say anything like that because you know, it's not really as terrible as

[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:42.180]
people think it is and that people say it is. It's quite a few. Why are they all saying that?

[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:46.300]
I have no idea. The cars. The cars. They probably they had a bad experience or something.

[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:51.420]
I mean, I read all the travel books. I read Frommel and I mean, everybody that writes a travel book,

[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:54.260]
I've got a minute of them at home. Oh, which I keep forgetting to bring those in for ourselves.

[01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:58.180]
I've got the universe showed up for them anyway. But nevertheless, I'll say the same thing. They say

[01:53:58.180 --> 01:54:01.960]
that Naples sucks. I don't think I don't think that's the case. Let me put it this way. You know,

[01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:05.700]
you seem to laugh Toronto at the time and the last time I was there, actually I was wrong in my hotel.

[01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:10.640]
But that doesn't mean Toronto is a terrible city. I happen to like the city. So I think I use

[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:15.900]
I suggest you better go and take a look for yourself. But Toronto is a safe city. It's not a city

[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:20.220]
that's low. I mean, there's, you know, beggars out on the street. But it's a safe city and there's

[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:24.780]
not. It's not rampant poverty all over the place. Everybody tells me Naples is basically a

[01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:28.940]
tremendously poor. And it not only that, but in fact, I have the big movement in Italy, as you know,

[01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:33.440]
where they wanted the central and northern parts of the country want to separate from suddenly,

[01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:38.480]
because it's so it's so poverty-stricken. I would say it's different. I wouldn't say it's

[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:42.020]
such poverty-stricken city. Well, then why do they want to separate? I mean, I mean,

[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:50.080]
I know. In other words, the whole world is just making these things up. No, I'm not going to say

[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:53.540]
bad pizza and apple-y. Right, yes. But you've got to go there next time you probably.

[01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:56.940]
Well, I'll not go there. I will never go there. I'm going to go to Toronto. I'm going to Rome.

[01:54:57.060 --> 01:55:00.660]
I'm going to Avenza. I mean, I want to go to Venice. I hear that blows too. I don't want to

[01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:05.260]
say that. I want to smell crappy canals. I want to smell crappy canals. I go to Amsterdam.

[01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:08.340]
And it's all over there. They got better stuff this now. I know all over the room for that

[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:12.800]
I insist too. Okay, but, you know, I told that, you know, I just put my two cents in there,

[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:16.620]
because it's me, you know, that people that say that, you know, yeah, the hell with the buffalo.

[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:22.100]
Okay, I'll even urge you. Okay, so what do you say? Oh, look at that. We got to, here's a mobile

[01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:27.180]
in Naples. You can correct the last caller. Hello. Neil. Yes. Well, first of all, if you ask

[01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:29.940]
any, Danny, which is the best town in Italy, it's always a town there from.

[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:36.020]
Most will agree that any Napoleon con people from Naples, it's basically the new work of Italy.

[01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:41.220]
Right. It's an armpit. I've been there myself. The other year. But the ballad, the ballad,

[01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:46.300]
there's a much better town than Naples Italy. And as far as the acting is concerned,

[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:50.740]
I tried it for two weeks, well, 15 pounds. But I realized that I'm addicted to bread and juices.

[01:55:51.220 --> 01:55:56.040]
So I had to kick it and I gained another 30 pounds. So with that, I'm going to go to our

[01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:59.420]
reason, have a big giant galette. Okay, we'll bring it back. Okay, there you go. We're

[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:03.160]
going to discuss in flowers for this funeral. Okay, get some panties for this guy.

[01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:08.760]
It's in defidels. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Tom 5, 60 on the mobile one line. Anybody in this audience

[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:12.020]
ever been to Naples Italy? I want to refute what this other guy said. This is a no in the

[01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:15.100]
Palatona. Maybe that was George in the Palatona, Jr. Con from Papano Park.

[01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:22.360]
Oh God, I could say so much, but I won't. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Tom 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:25.660]
21 till 1. Hey, go over your giant. That's not even one o'clock yet.

[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:28.840]
Where are we going to get some lunch from today for Christ's sake, George?

[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:35.700]
What's that? Oh, those are the Eccans bars. All right, let's hear it. Boy, my stock acre one.

[01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:39.100]
Carlos just brought a thing and there I thought it was just a piece of mail.

[01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:43.280]
Big envelope. And in the envelope, I bet you there's a whole bunch of

[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.280]
manage bars. Man, are they good? Are they good? No. But there's something. That's good.

[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:54.780]
Okay, now I feel like redeemers of human beings. Okay, so are you eating yours yet or what?

[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:58.040]
Have you already tasted it? Huh?

[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:03.100]
What about it? No, what kind is it? Is it the chocolate

[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:09.260]
with macadamia nut, almond brownie? Brownie almond brownie, huh?

[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:18.020]
I'm eating these. 2.6 carbs. How many carbs is that one kind?

[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:23.120]
Which by the way, they've left out there's a little note on the side down there at the bottom.

[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:27.440]
It says which of you unfolded. Glittering and poly dextrose have been omitted from the total

[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:31.180]
carbohydrate count. Is they do not react like regular carbohydrates and produce a negligible

[01:57:31.180 --> 01:57:34.900]
amount of glucose in the body? 2.6 grams for the whole bar.

[01:57:36.020 --> 01:57:38.420]
I think we're eating the same kind, aren't we? What do you mean?

[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:43.040]
No, I'm not eating a brownie hound. I'm not no brown. Oh, you're oh, look at that.

[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:50.760]
Oh, this is this is, you know what this is? No, it's a, see, you try to convince yourself that

[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:57.680]
this is good, okay? You look at it and it looks, it looks like it's sweating. Do you know what I mean

[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:01.620]
by that? It looks moist on the outside. Whoever saw a candy bar that's moist on the outside

[01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:08.080]
like it's sweating. But then you bite into it and um, uh, huh? Now do I have another one?

[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:12.560]
Did you eat the only one of those brownie hounds in here? Because they're a chocolate peanut butter.

[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:16.360]
I don't want that because I've had those. I don't like peanut butter that much in the beginning.

[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:18.380]
There were two of them. You've got the other one. I'm looking at it right now.

[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:22.520]
For what? The brownie hound? Oh, here it is. Omen brownie.

[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:27.120]
Well, yours must be better than the one that I mean. No.

[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:34.760]
But it's only two points this grant. And I'm going to tell you something. Eating this is going to make me so

[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:38.740]
nauseous that I won't do anything else to rest of the day. That's how they work. There you go.

[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:43.220]
Oh, yeah. And look at that. Look what it leaves on your fingers.

[01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:48.140]
The aftertaste ain't bad either. Oh, God.

[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:53.960]
Look what that leaves on your fingers for crying out loud.

[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:58.480]
Well, that makes us feel like duty. Yeah, that's what it looks like.

[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:06.520]
Man. WQAN. Yeah, let's speak to Neil. Sure, hold on. Where you calling from?

[01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:10.420]
Um, Miami. Okay. Okay, let's take a call from Miami. Hello.

[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:12.960]
Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Great.

[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:16.900]
I just got back from Vegas and I need to plug Rosewood grill bit.

[01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:20.840]
Okay. I didn't hear anything. What's that? I said, how was it?

[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:24.740]
It was great. We stopped the whole of the flaming young nice big hearty cut.

[01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:27.840]
Came back a little rare. So I just told the waiter to take it back.

[01:59:28.700 --> 01:59:31.580]
I mean, he bought it back still a little rare, but excellent excellent for a while.

[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:35.040]
Yeah. Come give us the bill and says that he talks to the man.

[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:39.220]
Paul does up and down for the mistake and said it should never have happened.

[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:42.020]
It gave it to me free. How do you like that? That was pretty good.

[01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:44.500]
That's pretty good because that's a very as you know, expensive joint.

[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:48.460]
Yeah, that was very happy, very close to place. Also, stop by the Bellagio.

[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:51.520]
Beautiful, beautiful hotels. A bit stuffy for me to.

[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:55.320]
Yeah. Not allowing kids in at all. Yeah, I am not impressed.

[01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:58.340]
The Bellagio is not for me. I mean, if you're into all that stuffy art and stuff,

[01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:01.880]
you know, even as much as I love Italy, I don't see any resemblance between anything there.

[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:05.680]
Maybe Naples, you know, maybe Sluterville, but I don't see anything I recognize in that place.

[02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:08.720]
I'm still like the MGM Grand. I like seeing all the other places.

[02:00:09.140 --> 02:00:11.720]
As far as staying, I love the MGM. You just can't go wrong there.

[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:13.700]
The Venetian looks like it's going to be a pretty nice place.

[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:15.200]
Now, that should be opening any day now, right?

[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:19.160]
It looks like it's about finished. Maybe another couple of months or so.

[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:21.080]
No, no, I think this month. Is it this month?

[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:24.940]
I think so. And the Paris looks like it's pretty good.

[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:27.600]
Paris, though, this fall, I believe October, November, something like that.

[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:29.920]
Great place. I hope the Paris goes over big,

[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:32.880]
or real big, because it's owned by Hilton. I've got to get that stock up.

[02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:34.120]
Have a great day, pal.

[02:00:34.220 --> 02:00:34.540]
Okay, you too.

[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:37.400]
Yeah, you know what the market, when it does?

[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:40.160]
See this Dow thing. I mean, like now, the Dow is up four points.

[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:42.980]
And then asdax down 17, it looks like it was going to be a really big day.

[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:45.960]
And like yesterday, it looked like it is as today because of the compact stuff.

[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:46.960]
And then it all went up.

[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:48.340]
Doesn't need a goddamn thing.

[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:52.580]
What it means is if you have some of those, you know, internet stocks that are still going crazy,

[02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:54.780]
Yahoo, and eBay, and you have those.

[02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:57.460]
Or if you got general electric, or you got IBM, or whatever,

[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:00.780]
those 10 or 12 stocks, you're in great shape.

[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:04.460]
AOL, other than that, you're in the grabber.

[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:07.980]
Nice hit the one, Caterpillar yesterday.

[02:01:08.180 --> 02:01:10.320]
One of the brokerage coming, I think I must have paid them off.

[02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:12.540]
They upgraded. They said, oh, yeah, that might be okay.

[02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:14.620]
They might sell another track that before the year 10,000.

[02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:19.660]
And went up to like almost 52, 51 and 3,8, something like that, almost 51 and a half.

[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:21.100]
Caterpillar. There you go.

[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:21.400]
Ah!

[02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:22.420]
We're off the hook, Derek.

[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:26.740]
So, Derek, I take the letters from Derek, and you rearrange them.

[02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:27.300]
You know what that spells?

[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:28.840]
Dreck, which is what these taste like.

[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:30.000]
Oh, no, these aren't bad.

[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:31.120]
Huh?

[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:33.040]
They're bad.

[02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:36.700]
But they leave a bad aftertaste in your mouth.

[02:01:38.260 --> 02:01:39.880]
Kind of like what SUD said before.

[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:43.540]
Well, that makes us feel like duty.

[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:44.280]
Yeah, like that.

[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:45.900]
Nah.

[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:48.160]
Here's your call from Green Bay.

[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:49.360]
Hello.

[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:50.020]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:50.380 --> 02:01:50.860]
Hello, Neil.

[02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:51.600]
How you doing, sir?

[02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:52.880]
Well, if I missed you, buddy.

[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:53.440]
I'll bet.

[02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:58.300]
Yeah, I haven't listened to you since 1990.

[02:01:58.740 --> 02:01:59.240]
I've been up here.

[02:01:59.700 --> 02:02:03.300]
I actually just found your station on real play around the computer this morning.

[02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:03.580]
Right.

[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:07.920]
Yeah, if we weren't so goddamn cheap, we could fill up the whole showroom

[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.740]
and they'd talk to people all over the rest of the world listening.

[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:13.240]
But we're too cheap to put an 800 line here because Greg Reed is a wannabe.

[02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:15.180]
I guess he's a cheap prick.

[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:19.140]
I had a hell of a time fine at all with station, you move to.

[02:02:19.420 --> 02:02:19.580]
Right.

[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:22.760]
But yeah, I've been searching for days actually,

[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:24.880]
not that I downloaded this real player thing.

[02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:25.700]
Then how does it come in?

[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:26.240]
How's it sound?

[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:27.340]
It's all in excellent.

[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:27.840]
Real good.

[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:28.520]
Beautiful.

[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:29.380]
Yeah, very good.

[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:33.500]
But I just wanted to call and let you know you got somebody up here listening.

[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:34.880]
Great. Well, God bless you, sir.

[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:38.540]
We had a call from Toronto today and now Green Bay and Naples, what more could you want?

[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:40.240]
Have a great day.

[02:02:40.380 --> 02:02:40.640]
You too.

[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:41.900]
And say hi to Brett Farve.

[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:42.420]
I'll do that.

[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:43.180]
And tell him to get a haircut.

[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:44.320]
Okay.

[02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:47.880]
Old Yahoo, that Brett Farve real comfortable with that toothpick in his mouth.

[02:02:48.740 --> 02:02:49.900]
That's our poor question today.

[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:51.680]
Let's name all of you like Dusty Baker.

[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:53.480]
There's a guy who always has a big toothpick in his mouth.

[02:02:53.860 --> 02:02:56.100]
Never trust a guy that's got a toothpick in his mouth all the time.

[02:02:56.420 --> 02:02:58.700]
Never lead him around like a full dinner table.

[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:02.840]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, animal mobile online.

[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.860]
So what's our take on the advantage, Boris?

[02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:06.760]
On a scale of a minus 8.

[02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:07.980]
Huh?

[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:09.180]
I mean, I'm eating him.

[02:03:09.780 --> 02:03:11.260]
I remember the first time I tried one.

[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:15.660]
And I took a bite full and I spitted out and chewed it in the waist basket.

[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:16.740]
I spat it in the basket.

[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:20.900]
In fact, now that I think about it,

[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:23.100]
although I am starving, I've eaten nothing all day.

[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:26.280]
But now that I really think about this one.

[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:32.280]
Yeah.

[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.360]
Well, maybe I'll try the other one.

[02:03:34.420 --> 02:03:35.600]
There are only 2.6 grams.

[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:37.100]
Oh, look at my fingers again.

[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:41.600]
Here's Miami.

[02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:41.900]
Hello.

[02:03:42.740 --> 02:03:43.320]
Hello, Neil.

[02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:43.900]
Yes, sir.

[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:47.140]
I am an investor from out of the country.

[02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:49.500]
And I tried to listen to your program.

[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:51.960]
Why can't you come up with something?

[02:03:53.340 --> 02:03:54.320]
You're a what?

[02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:55.500]
I'm an investor.

[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:56.540]
You can't just talk to me.

[02:03:56.540 --> 02:03:58.540]
What's the stuff you're making up with that beeping in the background?

[02:03:58.820 --> 02:03:59.400]
The background is disgusting.

[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:00.800]
Yeah, what are you listening to it for?

[02:04:01.180 --> 02:04:01.860]
Because I'm a developer.

[02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:04.920]
Why don't you turn on CND and watch something?

[02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:06.560]
I like to have you banana boat jackass.

[02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:07.220]
We got nothing.

[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:08.280]
And about people here already.

[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:09.740]
Okay, go back where you came from.

[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:10.940]
You foreign jackass.

[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:12.940]
We got too many foreigners already.

[02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:14.640]
I do like foreigners music, but nevertheless.

[02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:17.000]
Why don't you do this?

[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:17.600]
And why don't you do that?

[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:18.780]
Another phony below me call.

[02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:19.140]
Okay.

[02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:23.220]
Phony is a $97 bill.

[02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:25.380]
Here's plantation.

[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:25.820]
Hello.

[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:26.540]
Neil.

[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:27.100]
Yes, sir.

[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:28.700]
Yeah, I just want to know some of the people that

[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:30.420]
have mentored you in the business if you ever

[02:04:30.420 --> 02:04:31.420]
stay in contact with them.

[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:33.320]
Like Bill Smith and I are a Shenlarer people like that.

[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:34.140]
Bill Smith.

[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:37.480]
Bill Smith.

[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:42.600]
Are you answering it or just repeating his name?

[02:04:43.100 --> 02:04:44.620]
I'm asking you if you're serious.

[02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:45.680]
I'm serious.

[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:46.940]
I never met Bill Smith in my life.

[02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:47.460]
Who was the most poor?

[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:48.560]
Would you work the WKT?

[02:04:48.620 --> 02:04:49.140]
You didn't meet him?

[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:49.820]
No, I did not.

[02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:51.200]
He wasn't there when I worked the KT.

[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:51.740]
He had left.

[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:52.680]
Thank God.

[02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:54.580]
He was the most terminal boring person

[02:04:54.580 --> 02:04:57.580]
of the most self-indulgent jackass I ever heard

[02:04:57.580 --> 02:04:58.420]
on the year in my life.

[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:00.120]
Who did you like to work there?

[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:00.720]
What?

[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:02.320]
Who did you like to work there?

[02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:03.380]
Craig Worthing.

[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:04.160]
Okay.

[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:05.600]
Anybody else?

[02:05:05.740 --> 02:05:06.180]
Limit Russell?

[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:06.700]
Limit Russell?

[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:07.840]
That's on headline news now.

[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:08.900]
How about Err Shenliffe?

[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:12.140]
Errf was Errf was what he wasn't even

[02:05:12.140 --> 02:05:13.040]
of, he's still alive.

[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:16.360]
Would you like working with him or how about Sonny Ersch?

[02:05:17.020 --> 02:05:18.120]
What about Sonny Ersch?

[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:18.980]
Would you like Sonny Ersch?

[02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:19.220]
Yes.

[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:19.880]
Okay.

[02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:21.740]
And what is the point?

[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:22.740]
What are the point of these questions?

[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:23.480]
What does this mean?

[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:25.300]
What's the point of the show?

[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:26.480]
I mean, I'm just asking questions.

[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:27.160]
No, but why?

[02:05:27.380 --> 02:05:30.120]
Why do you care about who I worked for the KT 23 years ago?

[02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:30.680]
What does that mean?

[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:33.440]
Do you know if Err Shenliffe is still alive?

[02:05:33.620 --> 02:05:34.720]
No, no, that's why I was asking you.

[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:35.960]
I thought you'd know because you're in the industry.

[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:37.700]
Well, we'll take it because I'm in the industry.

[02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:38.780]
I'm not in the industry.

[02:05:38.860 --> 02:05:39.880]
So I work at QAM.

[02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:42.000]
Have you noticed?

[02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:44.400]
And have a nice day.

[02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:46.520]
Here's a guy that's got, I mean, he would,

[02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:47.720]
no wonder he liked Bill Smith.

[02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:49.120]
Call a man.

[02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:51.420]
Call a boring monotone.

[02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:52.060]
That's you, sir.

[02:05:52.300 --> 02:05:53.640]
Too bad we can't bring Bill Smith back.

[02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:55.000]
You probably listen to that goddamn show.

[02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:56.660]
Now that Sandy the lovely lady is off.

[02:05:56.900 --> 02:05:57.700]
See, that's the problem.

[02:05:58.020 --> 02:06:00.080]
We're probably getting some of Sandy's Drift Off.

[02:06:00.980 --> 02:06:02.680]
The 10 people that she had listening on Waxi.

[02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:04.940]
Now that that bitch is off the air.

[02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:05.920]
Lovely lady.

[02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:07.260]
Oh, give me a break already.

[02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:07.520]
Will you?

[02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:07.560]
Yeah.

[02:06:09.340 --> 02:06:10.720]
Irv Shindler, dead or alive.

[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.420]
Presby Robinson, dead or alive.

[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:14.020]
Steve David, I keep asking these things.

[02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:15.520]
Does anybody in the audience ever respond?

[02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:15.800]
No.

[02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:17.220]

[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:21.320]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the mobile one line.

[02:06:21.620 --> 02:06:23.300]
Yeah, Bill Smith and I had dinner last night,

[02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:24.260]
by the way of Denny's.

[02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:26.620]
And he picked up the check.

[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:27.420]
Do you believe that, sir?

[02:06:27.580 --> 02:06:27.740]
No.

[02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:29.180]
Well, just make up some stories.

[02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:30.060]
It'll make you feel better.

[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:31.680]
Irv Shindler's got, was over my house.

[02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:33.300]
We had Passover, Seder together, OK?

[02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:37.120]
We had Mata and we had a couple of baking cheeseburgers

[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:37.700]
on the side.

[02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:40.140]
Here's plantation.

[02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:40.560]
Hello?

[02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:41.480]
Neil.

[02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:42.060]
Yes, sir.

[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:43.500]
What is it with these people?

[02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:45.420]
It's probably something that you work with.

[02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:46.520]
They have no lives, sir.

[02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:47.760]
They have no life.

[02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:49.140]
They're trying to validate themselves.

[02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:50.700]
See if maybe it's something that you

[02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:52.700]
knew what, if you dimension them, that you do like them.

[02:06:53.620 --> 02:06:54.280]
Is that what it is?

[02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:55.100]
I don't know.

[02:06:56.420 --> 02:06:57.480]
The advantage part.

[02:06:57.520 --> 02:07:00.120]
I mean, I don't even know if Irv Shindler is alive yet.

[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:02.420]
He was an old guy when I worked with him 20 years ago.

[02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:04.760]
He said he's very likely not even with us anymore,

[02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:05.300]
so to speak.

[02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:07.620]
He's up there in a big place in the sky.

[02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:09.560]
Then my doctor kept referring to yesterday.

[02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:11.960]
Hey, the advantage part.

[02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:15.020]
Have you tried to cook at that one?

[02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:15.580]
No.

[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:16.820]
I'm not into cooking it.

[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:17.760]
You don't like cooking?

[02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:20.480]
I mean, it's OK, but I'm not crazy about cooking.

[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:21.100]
Why is it good?

[02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:24.300]
That's about the only one that I can take a bite of.

[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:25.020]
You can tolerate.

[02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:26.020]
You can tolerate.

[02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:27.920]
Don't you think that's the right word, tolerate?

[02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:28.660]
That's it.

[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:30.880]
I mean, you're not going to enjoy these.

[02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:33.100]
Anybody who says you're going to enjoy this,

[02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:35.340]
they must be a moron.

[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:37.240]
I can't turn the show off because I'm

[02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:38.860]
hoping somebody else would call in and say,

[02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:42.960]
hey, try this because a year on the adkinson.

[02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:43.720]
I got a...

[02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:44.560]
How are you doing on the diet?

[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:45.640]
60 pounds.

[02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:46.640]
Well, it's wrong with that.

[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:49.080]
I'm doing great, but I'm jealous of it for some sugar.

[02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:49.660]
I know.

[02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:51.900]
It was for something with some taste,

[02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:53.340]
something that's like a carbohydrate.

[02:07:54.060 --> 02:07:55.940]
That's where this guy, he act in this great,

[02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:58.740]
but that's the one area where he has really fallen down.

[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:00.280]
They haven't come up with good.

[02:08:00.380 --> 02:08:02.080]
I mean, like I said before, how much cheesecake

[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:03.180]
does anybody want?

[02:08:03.620 --> 02:08:05.980]
You know, they haven't come up with a lot of good products

[02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:08.380]
with a whole line of stuff that are good substitutes

[02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:09.080]
for like a snack.

[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:10.460]
What can you eat for a snack?

[02:08:10.580 --> 02:08:12.460]
You can't make a steak for a snack.

[02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:14.700]
How many goddamn slim gyms can you eat

[02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:16.860]
with all that sodium nitrate to begin with?

[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:18.480]
How much of that crap can you eat?

[02:08:18.860 --> 02:08:21.380]
Right, that stuff is good, and I enjoy eating that,

[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:23.980]
but you need the sugar.

[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:24.960]
That's...

[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:26.900]
Not the sugar, but you need something sweet.

[02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:27.460]
Not something to eat.

[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:28.560]
That's right, in fact.

[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:30.880]
Okay, we'll work on it, pal.

[02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:31.360]
I'll keep listening.

[02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:32.100]
Thanks, Mike.

[02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:34.580]
Oh, he's right about these.

[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:35.620]
In fact, I'm all...

[02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:37.860]
Just finishing this one, and these are not big bars.

[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:40.860]
They're about the size of a, like a Clark bar maybe.

[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:42.040]
What did you say?

[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:43.960]
I do like Clark bars, though.

[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:47.840]
See, that necklace back to all your God bull crap again,

[02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:50.480]
Dr. Mark, with your God crap that you were giving me yesterday

[02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:51.720]
in between all your hyperventilating

[02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:53.740]
and how come there's people with that door open out there?

[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:55.820]
Because we don't have a window all that.

[02:08:56.820 --> 02:08:58.920]
Who just closed it now that I'm ripping them and asking,

[02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:00.260]
this is a radio show.

[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:01.440]
I know it doesn't sound like one.

[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:03.020]
It doesn't look like a real radio station.

[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:04.460]
It's a radio show going on here.

[02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:06.560]
Okay, keep the guide in door closed.

[02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:08.920]
We're not operating a guide in guided tour now, okay?

[02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:10.160]
Stay away from us.

[02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:11.840]
We're busy looking at our fingers off

[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:12.980]
because it looks like a grotesque.

[02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:15.400]
These work, though.

[02:09:15.980 --> 02:09:16.620]
These work what?

[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:17.980]
I don't want to eat anything all day.

[02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:19.840]
Oh, I mean, to read again after eating this.

[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:21.520]
I'm serious.

[02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:22.960]
These are cock-a, baby.

[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:25.280]
And I was going to go, thank God I couldn't find them.

[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:27.480]
Because you know me, I would have bought like about 100 of them.

[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:28.300]
I would.

[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:30.060]
I wouldn't throw 99 of them away.

[02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:30.500]
Exactly.

[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:32.540]
I would have thrown 99 and a half of them away.

[02:09:33.180 --> 02:09:35.540]
Now, I can't wait to try the almond brownie-hound one,

[02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:36.980]
which I'm going to do in a moment, huh?

[02:09:37.660 --> 02:09:38.540]
What did that all the time?

[02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:39.940]
That sticks me up the right to the week.

[02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:43.560]
If I eat that, I'll probably be busy for weeks.

[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:47.180]
Come on, all you atkins people out there.

[02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:49.840]
Let's give us some alternatives to this swill.

[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:52.740]
To this almond brownie-hound garbage, okay?

[02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:54.540]
Requiring minds wants something good.

[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:00.860]
I go to my doctor who's totally out of his mind, I think certifiably,

[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:03.460]
yesterday he needs to be put in a rubber room for a few days and cool out.

[02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:04.620]
Crazy man.

[02:10:05.220 --> 02:10:08.940]
Then I come on here today and screaming and carrying on about these damn things

[02:10:08.940 --> 02:10:11.280]
because supposedly, because I, you know, time passes.

[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:13.920]
Like everything else, it passes.

[02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:17.140]
And you forget just how grotesque tasting these things were.

[02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:20.520]
Oh, and with all the respect to my close personal friend, whoever.

[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:22.520]
Oh, this is the guy that gave us the bokeh burgers.

[02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:28.300]
So, as I gave you a bokeh burgers, there's peas that you get peas in here also.

[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:29.160]
Yes, so, this is for you.

[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:31.360]
Well, at least you got something worth while you might eat.

[02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:33.620]
In fact, don't put them all away.

[02:10:41.460 --> 02:10:43.360]
It's the water to fill our.

[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:48.220]
And now the league of retarded citizens will promote their rendition of green onions.

[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:49.460]
They're don't make fun.

[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:51.480]
They were very hard for this.

[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:54.140]
Oh, this is the best thing I've ever seen.

[02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:58.940]
Oh, this is the best thing I've ever seen.

[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:09.280]
Oh, this is the best thing I've ever seen.

[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:36.900]
Oh, my in chalk, two minutes after one in five sixty WQM, I cannot believe I'm punching

[02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:37.600]
up the line in here.

[02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:38.600]
This has to be a put on.

[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:40.820]
Can this really be the real herb, Shindler?

[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:41.440]
Exactly.

[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:46.180]
I've been in the coast of O trying to arrange for you to bounce over there and settle that

[02:11:46.180 --> 02:11:46.440]
set.

[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:48.060]
You mean you finally got out of China, huh?

[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:48.820]
Yep.

[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:49.840]
Got out of China.

[02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:52.820]
And now I'm going to take care of the coastal.

[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:54.880]
Would you have a confirmation, of course?

[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:55.880]
Rob, of course.

[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:56.640]
Yep.

[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:57.320]
How you doing, herb?

[02:11:57.800 --> 02:11:59.200]
I'm doing a very good deal.

[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:00.420]
Got out of her.

[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:01.080]
I'm a little jealous.

[02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:01.600]
I'm not going to buy that.

[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:04.740]
But the herb must have just celebrated 110th birthday, I would think.

[02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:08.460]
Well, that's my goal, Neil.

[02:12:08.700 --> 02:12:09.940]
You got it confused.

[02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:10.680]
Yeah.

[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:12.060]
That's my goal.

[02:12:12.220 --> 02:12:13.320]
I haven't got there yet.

[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:14.380]
So what happened?

[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:16.000]
I had a long time to go.

[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:16.740]
I hope so.

[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:19.060]
Did somebody call in the tent that we were speaking about you?

[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:22.860]
Yeah, I got a phone call a few minutes ago and said, Neil said, you see alive?

[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:23.740]
Where is he?

[02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:26.740]
I know you wouldn't have been listening that much I know.

[02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:29.260]
Right.

[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:33.300]
It's not because I have any objection to your program.

[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:39.140]
It's simply that I'm so busy making money in this market that I don't really know what to do.

[02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:41.240]
I think I'm going to lose it in a month or two.

[02:12:41.340 --> 02:12:41.760]
Well, that's okay.

[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:44.920]
Everything collapses, but right now it looks so good.

[02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:45.320]
Yeah.

[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:48.960]
Well, the NASDAQ's done 15, so I'm not too excited right at the moment.

[02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:50.860]
I got a lot of CNBC on here, Marching.

[02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:55.720]
So what are you doing besides entertaining people?

[02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:57.200]
That's basically it.

[02:12:57.300 --> 02:13:00.240]
Or if I travel all around the world, I haven't been to China or Costa Rica, but there

[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:01.140]
are the next time I list.

[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:02.360]
Well, stay away from Costa Rica.

[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:02.800]
Yeah.

[02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:03.520]
For this way.

[02:13:03.700 --> 02:13:05.480]
And before you go to China, call me.

[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:06.460]
I've been there eight times.

[02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:06.800]
Yeah.

[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:08.900]
What about Amsterdam?

[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:09.560]
Have you been there?

[02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:11.320]
I've been to Amsterdam.

[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:16.200]
But I was always with my wife, so I never went through the Red Light District, except

[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:17.400]
to reserve it for cars.

[02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:18.200]
Yeah, what about Rome?

[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:20.460]
I would think that a good traveler like you would have had a great time.

[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:21.220]
Oh, there's marvelous.

[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:21.960]
Isn't that the best?

[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:22.280]
It's marvelous.

[02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:26.560]
Not that I had dinner with some people the other night that lived there.

[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:28.660]
And they have a...

[02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:31.220]
There are wealthy people there.

[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:36.840]
They have a squizzid new condominium in Tibus, Cain, a villa up in Tuscany.

[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:42.540]
And it's time to rest the time in Rome.

[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:42.980]
Yeah.

[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:43.880]
Well, there's that old thing.

[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:44.920]
When in Rome, do the Romans.

[02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:45.880]
So I've been doing that for years.

[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:47.860]
Well, listen, Irvitz, great hearing from you.

[02:13:48.260 --> 02:13:49.340]
It's good to hear from you.

[02:13:49.340 --> 02:13:52.420]
And if you want to call me sometime, I'm listed.

[02:13:52.900 --> 02:13:53.380]
Next one.

[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:55.240]
And I'll be glad to talk to you for a little bit.

[02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:56.280]
OK, Zagazone.

[02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:57.680]
Good luck with your program.

[02:13:57.780 --> 02:13:58.060]
Thanks.

[02:13:58.260 --> 02:13:58.540]
Bye-bye.

[02:13:59.120 --> 02:13:59.880]
Oh, my God.

[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:00.740]
Can you believe that?

[02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:01.340]
Can you believe it?

[02:14:01.340 --> 02:14:01.700]
Oh, my God.

[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:04.540]
So, like I said, thanks to that guy that called me before and brought up all those old

[02:14:04.540 --> 02:14:04.800]
names.

[02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:06.420]
Now, who are the other names he brought up?

[02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:08.860]
Oh, Bill Smith.

[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:10.200]
Do we want to hear from Bill Smith?

[02:14:10.580 --> 02:14:10.580]

[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:11.280]
Because I like her.

[02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:12.080]
Her versus a good guy.

[02:14:14.060 --> 02:14:15.420]
Old, but I mean a real good guy.

[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:18.480]
And here, that travel thing going all the time, trying to get people to go to China.

[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:19.220]
But he's a good guy.

[02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:21.640]
But Bill Smith, I don't know.

[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:22.340]
And I don't want to know.

[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:25.180]
And said, well, maybe he'll come to my funeral too, you know?

[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:27.960]
Because I don't hear from him no more.

[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:31.480]
Because I'm not the, I got to be disgusting on the air.

[02:14:31.660 --> 02:14:32.760]
And I do this thing I do now.

[02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:33.700]
And I make it a lot of money.

[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:37.440]
And I'm not doing that old boring establishment swill.

[02:14:37.580 --> 02:14:39.520]
But nevertheless, it gave me my first break in the market.

[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:41.220]
So I should be grateful for that, which I am.

[02:14:41.260 --> 02:14:42.800]
But other than that, have a nice life, Sid.

[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:43.880]
Mr. Establishment.

[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:44.760]
He's a good guy.

[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:47.500]
So let me tell you, Sid, about the Lin Russell.

[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:48.000]
Oh, sorry.

[02:14:48.620 --> 02:14:51.500]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT.

[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:53.140]
OK, let's get where you talk to Irvish and learn.

[02:14:53.260 --> 02:14:53.660]
Oh, boy.

[02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:55.140]
That's our poll question.

[02:14:55.260 --> 02:14:56.180]
Which put you in a call more?

[02:14:56.560 --> 02:14:58.700]
My talk to Irvish and learn is a nice guy, but fairly old.

[02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:01.100]
Or the story about the famous from Howard Kleinberg.

[02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:03.680]
I like reading that thing about the famous.

[02:15:03.780 --> 02:15:05.480]
OK, the audience obviously did not.

[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:08.120]
They were disgusted and revolted by that.

[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:10.140]
Because they wouldn't know the famous restaurant from Uranus.

[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:10.400]
OK?

[02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:10.680]
Correct.

[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:11.020]
Right.

[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:16.300]
Speaking of what I just said, these advantage bars,

[02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:19.800]
I dare one person in this audience, OK?

[02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:20.760]
I dare you.

[02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:22.300]
Let's do a thing like little kids.

[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:22.680]
Do you know?

[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:25.540]
I double dare you to call this show and say

[02:15:25.540 --> 02:15:28.780]
that the Atkins advantage bars that you would like them.

[02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:29.060]
OK?

[02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:31.880]
I dare you to say, because we will trace the call.

[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:36.520]
And after the guy with the rubber room with the butterfly

[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:39.520]
in it, after he gets a hold of my doctor first,

[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:40.920]
then we'll have him come and get you.

[02:15:41.140 --> 02:15:42.220]
You'll be next on the list.

[02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:48.080]
Seriously, I'm going to puke is what I'm going to do.

[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:52.320]
Like them compared to what?

[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:54.220]
Compared to that.

[02:15:54.460 --> 02:15:55.000]
And you know something?

[02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:56.280]
I don't want to gross you out.

[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:57.140]
It's after a lunch time.

[02:15:58.020 --> 02:16:00.020]
I would have rather picked up those underwear

[02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:02.620]
that I left at the Eden Center Restroom on Sunday in Toronto

[02:16:03.620 --> 02:16:07.000]
and had lunch off of those after I had my little mishap.

[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.780]
I'd rather have that than this.

[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:16.560]
I mean, is there anybody who has the audacity to tell me?

[02:16:16.660 --> 02:16:17.760]
Now, they do fill you up.

[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:18.260]
They're filling.

[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:20.840]
I don't know if they're filling or they just make you nauseous.

[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.140]
I love Dr. Atkins.

[02:16:23.340 --> 02:16:24.560]
I'm a big proponent of his diet.

[02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:27.540]
I mean, it works if you can stick with it and et cetera

[02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:28.080]
and so on.

[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:33.520]
But, but I will not, for any, for lover money,

[02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:35.320]
I'm not going to come on here and tell you something's good

[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:36.460]
if it's a piece of crap.

[02:16:36.460 --> 02:16:38.320]
And believe me, this isn't even good enough

[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:39.920]
to be identified as a piece of crap.

[02:16:40.700 --> 02:16:43.880]
My golden retriever leaves big bombs in a backyard every day

[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:46.180]
that I'm sure are much more advertising than this.

[02:16:46.260 --> 02:16:47.460]
I'm not going to check it out myself,

[02:16:47.460 --> 02:16:50.800]
but, you know, I mean, I'm halfway through the brownie

[02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:54.900]
hound the bar, aptly named, by the way,

[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:59.400]
because it looks like and taste like brownies.

[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:02.260]
They fill you up because you have to use a gallon of water

[02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:03.980]
just to wash it down.

[02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:06.440]
I mean, there is a,

[02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:07.980]
I can't describe it.

[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:13.540]
There is kind of like a rancid, raunchy, rotten taste

[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:18.640]
that goes along with these that is not to be believed

[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:20.440]
and it's not animal or vegetable.

[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:23.660]
What is it besides the Dreck?

[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:27.640]
I mean, seriously, I love you, Dr. Bob

[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:29.600]
and my good friend Bob, look it over there, Mr.

[02:17:29.940 --> 02:17:32.180]
we once went to Vegas and had a nightmare doing it, you know,

[02:17:32.980 --> 02:17:35.520]
but these advantage bars and then I have the same thing

[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:36.980]
happen last year, why would I like them now?

[02:17:37.140 --> 02:17:38.320]
Are they any different than they were then?

[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:39.140]
It's the same crap.

[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:41.540]
They are inedible.

[02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:43.720]
Now I'm going to get through this second one

[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:44.900]
and I'm going to get this, this will,

[02:17:45.060 --> 02:17:48.040]
this, it makes you sick to your stomach, okay?

[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:51.620]
Maybe that's, maybe that's part of the reason

[02:17:51.620 --> 02:17:52.800]
that these things work on the diet.

[02:17:52.940 --> 02:17:55.440]
You become so nauseous, you feel so,

[02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:58.400]
your, your kishis are just twisting from nausea.

[02:17:58.840 --> 02:17:59.780]
Have you belched yet?

[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:03.260]
I couldn't because it would all go back at you.

[02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:05.000]
If you think the aftertaste is good,

[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:08.100]
just wait until the repeater happens.

[02:18:08.460 --> 02:18:10.800]
And then wait, oh boy, wait till that.

[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:16.080]
Nine minutes after one at five, 60 WQAM.

[02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:17.500]
Get the honey, Junior.

[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:20.240]
I like luxury and carbon.

[02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:23.900]
Honey, little pie with chocolate chip ice cream.

[02:18:25.060 --> 02:18:26.880]
I'll take with chocolate chip ice cream is good.

[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:33.500]
Ringing and chocolate chip ice cream.

[02:18:33.500 --> 02:18:35.780]
Wait, chocolate chip ice cream even better.

[02:18:36.340 --> 02:18:37.060]
That's nothing.

[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:41.240]
Did you ever suck the jelly out of the jelly doughnut?

[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:41.640]
Yeah.

[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:44.340]
You said, fill it with chocolate chip ice cream.

[02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:48.720]
I like this stuff, a jelly doughnut

[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:50.260]
with Reese's peanut butter cut.

[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:53.640]
Then put it in a warm oven and let the chocolate

[02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:55.380]
and everything melt into the dough.

[02:18:56.940 --> 02:18:58.680]
How about peanut butter and jelly

[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:01.160]
for a chocolate-covered gray and cracker?

[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:03.440]
Within my ears of banana on top.

[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:04.720]
Yes.

[02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:06.800]
Could I have a little lemon in my water please?

[02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:09.560]
I make chocolate chip cookies with eminem.

[02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:10.760]
I'd have chocolate chip cookies.

[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:11.500]
No, not yet.

[02:19:11.980 --> 02:19:12.080]
Yeah.

[02:19:12.420 --> 02:19:14.740]
So you can have a little more lemon in my hot water please?

[02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:16.400]
Still up a lot of lemon?

[02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:19.980]
No, I'd like a little fresh orange.

[02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:21.840]
You squeezed it more in if you got it.

[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:25.260]
No, sorry.

[02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:28.360]
Okay, that lemon.

[02:19:30.420 --> 02:19:33.040]
I promise they got chocolate-covered orange wedges.

[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:34.580]
Did you just dribbles down your chin?

[02:19:35.260 --> 02:19:35.800]
Oh, sure.

[02:19:37.720 --> 02:19:40.580]
Junior, could I have just a drop of honey in this please?

[02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:41.500]
Just a drop.

[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:42.980]
Where's the actual food?

[02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:45.560]
It's covered with that sweet dark chocolate.

[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:46.580]
You know?

[02:19:47.660 --> 02:19:48.160]
Oh boy.

[02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:51.000]
I'd like the stuff one that I'm gonna down that.

[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:51.540]
Mmm.

[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:52.780]
Mmm.

[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:53.700]
Mmm.

[02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:55.260]
Get the honey, Junior.

[02:19:55.260 --> 02:19:57.640]
I'm giving my honey, Junior.

[02:19:58.180 --> 02:19:59.220]
It's in the cover, Tom.

[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:01.260]
Well, get it.

[02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:06.740]
What else do they cover with that chocolate?

[02:20:06.740 --> 02:20:10.620]
I mean, besides the orange wedges, grapes, peaches, strawberries.

[02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:13.320]
Junior, honey.

[02:20:14.420 --> 02:20:18.480]
Those big, juicy stem strawberries are dipped into that dark dark chocolate.

[02:20:19.740 --> 02:20:20.040]
Oh.

[02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:22.040]
Oh.

[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:29.300]
Get the honey.

[02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:31.180]
Get the honey.

[02:20:32.380 --> 02:20:33.160]
Oh no.

[02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:53.860]
This is the worst swill.

[02:20:54.520 --> 02:20:56.020]
And just to show you what a trooper am.

[02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:58.560]
Because I don't want to pre-judge one of each.

[02:20:58.760 --> 02:20:59.560]
There's three different flavors.

[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:00.540]
Chocolate, macadamia.

[02:21:00.620 --> 02:21:01.000]
I had that.

[02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:02.140]
Unbelievable.

[02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:03.580]
What was the other one?

[02:21:03.700 --> 02:21:04.920]
The brownie-hound?

[02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:05.480]
Had that.

[02:21:07.940 --> 02:21:08.340]
Inedible.

[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:12.120]
Now we got, I mean, it's only 2.6 grams per bar of carbs.

[02:21:12.420 --> 02:21:14.060]
So three of them is like 7.8 grams.

[02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:16.580]
And after this third one,

[02:21:16.580 --> 02:21:19.200]
and I do mean you turn one.

[02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:21.300]
I won't be eating for a week.

[02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:22.740]
That's how this works.

[02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:27.340]
Now what kind of this peanut butter, a direct chunky peanut butter?

[02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:30.680]
And then you'll be hurling chunks when you finish eating this if you can.

[02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:35.880]
I have never had anything so rancid, so gross in my mouth.

[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:39.040]
And believe me, I've had plenty of things in my mouth in my life.

[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:40.320]
But never anything.

[02:21:42.220 --> 02:21:42.720]
Oh.

[02:21:43.340 --> 02:21:43.840]
God.

[02:21:45.620 --> 02:21:46.360]
Here's Miami.

[02:21:46.360 --> 02:21:46.640]
Hello.

[02:21:48.620 --> 02:21:48.980]
Miami.

[02:21:49.860 --> 02:21:50.700]
Oh, hello, Neil.

[02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:51.200]
Yes, sir.

[02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:56.540]
Wanted to let you know a possible substitute for that stuff of yours.

[02:21:56.820 --> 02:21:57.060]
Oh.

[02:21:57.500 --> 02:21:59.160]
Because I had the mistake of doing that.

[02:21:59.700 --> 02:22:01.820]
Oh, this is the most foul tasting prep.

[02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:02.520]

[02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:06.200]
Directed the word, direct is insulted by using that applied to this.

[02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:08.620]
Yeah, and you might like this because Walgreens just started tearing them.

[02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:10.260]
They're the pure protein bars.

[02:22:10.460 --> 02:22:13.460]
And the one that have all the carbohydrates in them that I checked out last night at Walgreens?

[02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:15.380]
Yeah, but that was, oh, you did check it out last night.

[02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:16.760]
I voted with carbohydrates, right?

[02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:18.820]
Yeah, I think it was 11 grams for the one of them.

[02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:18.820]

[02:22:19.420 --> 02:22:23.400]
But if you want something that will help you get past the sugar fix, that chocolate mousse

[02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:26.020]
and the chewy chocolate chip will definitely highlight your day.

[02:22:26.180 --> 02:22:26.900]
Chocolate mousse one.

[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:29.060]
It's like white chocolate mousse.

[02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:30.380]
You mean the protein bar?

[02:22:30.620 --> 02:22:31.320]
Yeah, the pure protein.

[02:22:31.500 --> 02:22:35.280]
They came out with these flavors, like two of them, two new flavors and they are incredible.

[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:38.440]
I guess 11 grams isn't bad if you're not going to eat much of any other carbs the rest of the day.

[02:22:38.500 --> 02:22:39.000]
Maybe a salad.

[02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:40.320]
Oh, yeah, but it's like a dessert.

[02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:42.020]
But at least it's good though, huh?

[02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:45.500]
Oh, yeah, that's because I do the actin's relatively strict.

[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:48.000]
I cheat one day a week to keep myself sane.

[02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:50.160]
You have tried these advantage bars?

[02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:51.940]
I made them stay one time.

[02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:52.840]
I've been browning.

[02:22:53.160 --> 02:22:54.700]
I like I just put my mouth in Crisco.

[02:22:54.940 --> 02:22:56.060]
Oh, my God.

[02:22:56.300 --> 02:22:58.980]
And I just took a handful of lard and swallow it with the same exact feeling.

[02:22:59.140 --> 02:23:00.200]
Oh, well thank you, sir.

[02:23:00.300 --> 02:23:00.820]
God bless you.

[02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:01.680]
All right, good luck, my friend.

[02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:02.240]
And keep it up.

[02:23:02.500 --> 02:23:02.640]
All right.

[02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:04.800]
So there's a suggestion for you.

[02:23:05.080 --> 02:23:06.040]
Just check the carbs in the back.

[02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:07.280]
The protein bar in Walgreens.

[02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:08.440]
Okay, I'll check that one out.

[02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:12.840]
Because the idea, and I'm going to finish all three of them here just to show you.

[02:23:13.020 --> 02:23:13.180]
What?

[02:23:14.320 --> 02:23:16.240]
It is going to make me tremendously ill.

[02:23:16.620 --> 02:23:17.540]
You're a braver man than I.

[02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:20.460]
No, just dumber, not braver, dumber.

[02:23:21.340 --> 02:23:25.380]
The good news is though, because there's a silver lining in the middle of even the darkest cloud.

[02:23:26.380 --> 02:23:27.680]
They were for free, baby.

[02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:29.780]
At the South Florida way, they were for free.

[02:23:30.100 --> 02:23:30.120]
Okay.

[02:23:30.300 --> 02:23:32.860]
Oh, man.

[02:23:33.140 --> 02:23:33.900]
Let me say it again.

[02:23:34.060 --> 02:23:37.220]
I challenge one person out there in the audience to call a shot.

[02:23:37.220 --> 02:23:38.360]
Of course, your wife likes him.

[02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:41.280]
But we know you've got a happy Chatey married you.

[02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:41.680]
Yeah.

[02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:44.000]
You say the same dilemma.

[02:23:44.680 --> 02:23:45.340]
Meaning what?

[02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:48.040]
We're on the Atkins and she wants something to nosh on during the day.

[02:23:48.140 --> 02:23:48.680]
I mean, when you get to the most beautiful day.

[02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:52.800]
You said she brings him home by the bag full of she's eating these left and right, you said.

[02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:53.120]
Yeah.

[02:23:53.720 --> 02:23:55.220]
In lieu of real food.

[02:23:55.380 --> 02:23:56.520]
Oh, come on.

[02:23:56.620 --> 02:24:01.860]
There's got to be more to life than the Atkins advantage bar boys and girls.

[02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:03.840]
There must be more to life than this.

[02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:07.200]
You see, again, if you believe in this God, Bullcrap, how come everything is going to be?

[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:13.020]
The thing that tastes good is loaded with carbohydrates and makes you fat and sick and die, huh?

[02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:13.920]
All right.

[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:15.060]
Which one is the least bad?

[02:24:15.540 --> 02:24:16.520]
No, there's no such thing.

[02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:18.740]
There is no such thing.

[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:19.880]
Oh, in fact, you know something.

[02:24:19.980 --> 02:24:22.280]
I'm starting to develop a little cramp without the M.

[02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:26.180]
I'm having another Toronto-like experience.

[02:24:26.180 --> 02:24:27.180]
I think any minute now.

[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:30.080]
But don't have too far to go down the hall to make it.

[02:24:30.260 --> 02:24:32.280]
Oh, this is...

[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:33.460]
Oh, I'm not eating this.

[02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:34.300]
Are you crazy?

[02:24:34.980 --> 02:24:36.140]
Straight in the waist, Baskin.

[02:24:37.620 --> 02:24:41.500]
Like I have to prove a point here by eating three pieces of sticks of Dreck.

[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:44.720]
Here's a mobile in Bonita Springs.

[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:45.040]
Hello?

[02:24:45.540 --> 02:24:46.540]
Hey, Neil, how are you?

[02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:48.320]
Okay, sir. I'm getting sick as a dog.

[02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:49.240]
I hear that.

[02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:52.400]
Hey, I'm just down here working.

[02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:56.260]
I'm from the Tampa area and we miss you very much in that area.

[02:24:56.340 --> 02:24:57.980]
Yeah, well, I wish we could say it was mutual.

[02:24:58.580 --> 02:24:59.280]
Oh, jeez.

[02:24:59.340 --> 02:24:59.980]
I don't think I'm a person.

[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:00.220]
Yeah.

[02:25:00.740 --> 02:25:06.020]
We got a guy on the radio up there in sports show during the day that rips off a lot of stuff.

[02:25:06.020 --> 02:25:07.120]
Yeah, well, go say hi to him.

[02:25:07.140 --> 02:25:07.600]
Okay, thanks.

[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:11.620]
Okay, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, PON 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:15.120]
See, we're not going to have any takers on this advantage-bar thing.

[02:25:16.020 --> 02:25:18.140]
This audience has hopefully got better taste in that.

[02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:19.060]
Even the people with bad...

[02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:22.480]
Even the people like vanilla ice cream wouldn't eat those things on a bet.

[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:24.840]
Here's Naples.

[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:25.120]
Hello?

[02:25:25.660 --> 02:25:26.140]
Yo, Neil.

[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:26.640]
Yes, sir.

[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:29.840]
You've got to go out and try the coconut chocolate one.

[02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:30.460]
Yeah, right.

[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:31.500]
No, I'm serious.

[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:32.120]
No.

[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:33.660]
I bought all four flavors.

[02:25:33.660 --> 02:25:33.920]
Yeah.

[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:36.400]
And the other three are exactly as you said.

[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:36.620]
Yeah.

[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:39.060]
It tastes like Aspertaim and...

[02:25:39.060 --> 02:25:39.440]
No, they don't.

[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:40.400]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:25:40.740 --> 02:25:42.260]
They're asking about, yeah, now you're going to get to close.

[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:44.480]
I'm serious, I answer.

[02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:44.860]
It's very well put.

[02:25:44.860 --> 02:25:44.860]

[02:25:44.860 --> 02:25:44.860]

[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:46.340]
They're saying that's very well put.

[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:50.540]
Have you guys tried the coconut one?

[02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:51.860]
I don't have no coconut one.

[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:52.760]
Maybe that's the only good one.

[02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:53.260]
It's going on.

[02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:56.820]
Okay, that's why they pawned the right to this crap off on us because they think that the only good one must be out.

[02:25:57.060 --> 02:25:57.680]
Yeah, that's crap.

[02:25:57.880 --> 02:25:58.320]
It's garbage.

[02:25:58.720 --> 02:25:59.940]
Crappley, I'm telling you, sir.

[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:02.040]
Crapp is not in the same category as this.

[02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:05.140]
And what a crap is fine with Zing compared to this.

[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.700]
Have you tried the, like in the book where it says,

[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:11.560]
eat some diet gel with some whipped cream?

[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:17.080]
Oh, I went through the diet gel with whipped cream till I got gel coming out of my ears out of my pores.

[02:26:17.220 --> 02:26:20.120]
If I ever see any more diet gel or cheesecake, I'm going to barf.

[02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:21.280]
All right, well, good luck.

[02:26:21.500 --> 02:26:21.920]
Thanks, pal.

[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:23.380]
See you in Napoli.

[02:26:24.780 --> 02:26:28.940]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:29.820]
Killer carbohydrates.

[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:32.940]
The only problem is God made everything else taste pretty bad.

[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:42.180]
How come we can't get like a hot fudge Sunday on fish food with thick gobs of hot fudge and whipped cream and marshmallow on top and have no carbs, huh?

[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:47.760]
How God, you bastard God, you no good miserable statistics son of a bitch.

[02:26:47.980 --> 02:26:49.160]
How can we did this to us, huh?

[02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:53.520]
And then it made us every now and then have a, in our pants and top it all off.

[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:55.820]
This is kind of like the frosting on the cake, so to speak.

[02:26:57.120 --> 02:26:58.620]
Kind of looked like the frosting on the cake.

[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:02.060]
Here's a mobile invoker. Hello.

[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:03.420]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:27:03.580 --> 02:27:04.040]
Okay, sir.

[02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:05.580]
I found a great dessert for you.

[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:07.660]
In Bokor, it's known as a fat-free cheesecake.

[02:27:08.220 --> 02:27:09.640]
I'm not, no more cheesecake, sir.

[02:27:11.220 --> 02:27:11.980]
No more cheesecake.

[02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:15.120]
And then he said, fat-free.

[02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:16.820]
Sure, let me shit again.

[02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:19.300]
Fat-free is for assholes, okay?

[02:27:19.460 --> 02:27:22.040]
Sir, don't take it personally unless it does happen to apply.

[02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:23.840]
Fat-free is for idiots.

[02:27:24.300 --> 02:27:25.860]
Fat-free is a fraud, okay?

[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:27.200]
Fat-free is crap.

[02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:33.520]
They had a piece on CNN here a couple of days ago about fat kids in America.

[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:39.700]
It's not only the adults like us who are getting fat, but now it was a frightening, a terrifying number of fat kids.

[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:43.480]
Not just teenagers, but like young kids who are big and fat.

[02:27:43.780 --> 02:27:45.480]
And you know, I want to say this to you right now, okay?

[02:27:46.020 --> 02:27:49.740]
All you parents out there that let us bet enough that you're fat.

[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:54.820]
But you parents that walk around with your fat kids shame on you, child abuse.

[02:27:55.880 --> 02:28:00.720]
I don't want to mention no names of somebody that was in here a few days ago with his fat son,

[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:03.640]
who seemed like a real nice kid if he didn't wait 10,000 pounds.

[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:08.940]
Fat parents have fat kids.

[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:11.300]
Am I right?

[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:12.020]
Yes.

[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:12.500]
Or what?

[02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:16.500]
I guess they want their kids to be as sick as they are.

[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:22.740]
Man, man, having your kid walk around waddling around and everybody else in school is making fun.

[02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:24.360]
Hey, and Johnny's a fat little pig.

[02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:26.120]
Hey, what's he, hey, what's he?

[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:30.700]
Terrible. Shame on you.

[02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:34.340]
If you'd feed Johnny one or two of these Actions bars, he would need for a month.

[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:37.740]
Just stick one of those in his lunch box, man.

[02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:43.740]
Johnny will spend most of the afternoon at school on his hands and knees puking his brains out.

[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:46.600]
Here's a mobile in Pompolyne. Hello.

[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:47.220]
Hello, Leo.

[02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:49.100]
I like the Actions bar.

[02:28:49.660 --> 02:28:50.320]
I'm sorry.

[02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:51.080]
No, you're not.

[02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:51.820]
Yes, I am.

[02:28:52.380 --> 02:28:52.960]
I'm not.

[02:28:53.100 --> 02:28:53.100]

[02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:58.480]
I just got the wraparound front of me of the...

[02:28:58.480 --> 02:28:58.900]
Oh.

[02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:03.100]
Oh my god.

[02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:07.340]
Well, if I could only paraphrase what this guy just said, okay, because I can't put it on the ear.

[02:29:07.740 --> 02:29:09.300]
What's wrong with this thing now, but...

[02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:10.040]
Oh, here we go.

[02:29:11.620 --> 02:29:13.160]
What is wrong with this thing?

[02:29:14.980 --> 02:29:16.440]
You know, it's not even worth it now.

[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:17.020]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:29:17.380 --> 02:29:18.300]
The fact that he said...

[02:29:18.300 --> 02:29:19.080]
Don't make this shit.

[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:19.720]
...is what he said.

[02:29:21.820 --> 02:29:23.640]
God, I'm getting really deathly ill.

[02:29:23.740 --> 02:29:24.540]
I only need a little...

[02:29:24.540 --> 02:29:26.660]
Just about a turret of that last bar.

[02:29:26.820 --> 02:29:29.560]
That one, you tell me was so great to peanut butter one?

[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:30.660]
I didn't say it was.

[02:29:30.660 --> 02:29:31.660]
I don't even like peanut butter.

[02:29:31.660 --> 02:29:33.740]
I like peanut butter by itself.

[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:34.420]
You know what I mean?

[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:35.720]
Like, I could eat peanut butter.

[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:36.100]
Huh?

[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:36.760]
I do.

[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:38.800]
I like chunky peanut butter.

[02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:44.200]
Well, I haven't eaten it in years, and it's not good for you, but I could eat it out of the jar, like with a spoon.

[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:45.980]
I used to do that.

[02:29:46.260 --> 02:29:48.960]
But like peanut butter ice creams and peanut butter...

[02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:50.060]
Oh, horrible.

[02:29:50.560 --> 02:29:51.140]
It's like mushrooms.

[02:29:51.560 --> 02:29:52.300]
I love mushrooms.

[02:29:54.340 --> 02:29:55.960]
But I don't like mushrooms on pizza.

[02:29:56.840 --> 02:29:58.500]
Can't stand shrooms on pizza.

[02:29:59.880 --> 02:30:02.820]
In fact, those magic mushrooms, like they have an homestead on, those are pretty good.

[02:30:05.140 --> 02:30:07.060]
Oh, man, where am I?

[02:30:07.160 --> 02:30:11.120]
Who, I feel like Admiral Stockdale, mobile in Miami.

[02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:11.420]
Hello?

[02:30:11.880 --> 02:30:13.020]
Hey, Neil, that's Shroom Peas.

[02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:13.640]
Pretty good, too.

[02:30:15.020 --> 02:30:17.400]
I'm suffering the same thing as YouTube, the Acton's Cane.

[02:30:17.720 --> 02:30:20.320]
It's good to hear some kind of something in the mid-let you get through the day.

[02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:20.800]
Oh.

[02:30:21.240 --> 02:30:25.180]
I wanted to call on, thank you for the tickets for Sunday, for the Mollins game.

[02:30:25.500 --> 02:30:27.500]
Yeah, I was buying some Chris in the...

[02:30:27.500 --> 02:30:29.140]
That certain part of town.

[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:31.520]
And I actually had a good time about my...

[02:30:31.520 --> 02:30:33.660]
But when we're drove from my daughter and, you know, we had a good time.

[02:30:33.820 --> 02:30:35.560]
I understand that there's no...

[02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:38.300]
They're not drawn flies when I had the stadium talk, it's out of control.

[02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:40.240]
So, that's just one call.

[02:30:40.420 --> 02:30:40.760]
Thank you.

[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:41.540]
That's a really good time.

[02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:42.760]
Okay, glad you're the one.

[02:30:42.940 --> 02:30:43.100]
Thanks.

[02:30:43.340 --> 02:30:43.720]
Okay, thanks.

[02:30:44.060 --> 02:30:45.940]
There's a guy that we gave free tickets to the Mollins.

[02:30:46.020 --> 02:30:46.820]
He actually had a good time.

[02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:47.720]
Nice going, sir.

[02:30:48.840 --> 02:30:54.560]
5'6'7'5'60, pound 5'60, on the AT&T wireless line, we're discussing.

[02:30:56.180 --> 02:31:01.160]
Oh, we're not discussing, we're discussing is what we are with these things.

[02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:02.260]
Oh, gross.

[02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:04.180]
Gag me with a prune, baby.

[02:31:05.660 --> 02:31:06.580]
I'd rather have my...

[02:31:06.580 --> 02:31:08.520]
If this is all I had to eat, this is the honest truth.

[02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:11.660]
If this is what I was my cuisine for the rest of my life,

[02:31:11.880 --> 02:31:13.700]
I'd rather have my taste buds scraped.

[02:31:14.640 --> 02:31:16.380]
And just drink liquid protein, you know what I'm saying?

[02:31:18.060 --> 02:31:19.480]
Just sip it through a straw.

[02:31:20.420 --> 02:31:23.060]
Far preferable to eating this swill.

[02:31:23.060 --> 02:31:27.440]
This unidentifiable, this unacceptable, this grotesque,

[02:31:27.540 --> 02:31:29.560]
Duru, Kaka, Krap.

[02:31:30.580 --> 02:31:32.800]
I mean, you want a mouthful of...

[02:31:32.800 --> 02:31:34.140]
Oh, that's the wrong thing, yeah.

[02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:38.320]
Have you ever been to a B-permanious store, by the way, speaking of...

[02:31:39.240 --> 02:31:39.980]
Speaking of that?

[02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:41.740]
I'm trying to hear the fart, Tommy.

[02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:49.780]
I can't take too much butter.

[02:31:50.780 --> 02:31:52.820]
It shoots right out my ass.

[02:31:53.040 --> 02:31:53.400]
Welcome.

[02:31:54.220 --> 02:31:56.080]
Bedfurt and I bring up

[02:31:56.780 --> 02:31:58.640]
Blue me to the can.

[02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:01.880]
I can't get a pot of flour.

[02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:04.780]
And all that is you, yeah.

[02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:08.440]
I can't get a pot of you, sweet butter.

[02:32:09.180 --> 02:32:11.220]
And I get a pot of flour.

[02:32:11.280 --> 02:32:14.000]
I can't take too much butter.

[02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:16.940]
I can't take it at all.

[02:32:17.940 --> 02:32:20.340]
I ask for it from all that stuff.

[02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:23.020]
And especially sorbets all.

[02:32:23.140 --> 02:32:27.180]
I know I need to have it in a grotesque...

[02:32:27.180 --> 02:32:29.420]
I want it out of all my hands.

[02:32:29.920 --> 02:32:32.320]
It'll cut out like it needs butter.

[02:32:33.300 --> 02:32:38.320]
I just can't take too much butter.

[02:32:38.800 --> 02:32:41.200]
It goes through me too fast.

[02:32:41.980 --> 02:32:44.640]
And every time I eat it,

[02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:47.440]
I have to take my hands.

[02:32:48.160 --> 02:32:50.880]
I can't take too much butter.

[02:32:51.580 --> 02:32:55.280]
I'm going to have to take my hands.

[02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:57.640]
I can't take too much butter.

[02:32:58.600 --> 02:33:00.100]
I'm going to have to take too much butter.

[02:33:00.100 --> 02:33:02.220]
Especially the tubal vitamin C.

[02:33:02.780 --> 02:33:03.300]
Wow.

[02:33:05.140 --> 02:33:06.560]
132 at 560 W.

[02:33:06.680 --> 02:33:08.840]
George tells me that we've been getting all these calls off here.

[02:33:09.100 --> 02:33:09.940]
Oh, that guy was right.

[02:33:09.940 --> 02:33:11.340]
You got to try that coconut bar.

[02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:13.280]
That advantage bar.

[02:33:13.780 --> 02:33:16.900]
Because what's better than a piece of coconut in it, huh?

[02:33:18.940 --> 02:33:20.600]
Here's a pig report in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:33:21.180 --> 02:33:21.960]
Hi, Neil.

[02:33:22.340 --> 02:33:23.340]
Major Bigger Fort.

[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:25.960]
Southbound Farglot at the commercial.

[02:33:26.180 --> 02:33:26.740]
You got DOT.

[02:33:27.160 --> 02:33:28.020]
You got FHP.

[02:33:28.160 --> 02:33:29.000]
You got BSR.

[02:33:29.720 --> 02:33:30.200]
Excellent.

[02:33:31.380 --> 02:33:32.660]
Also, big asses in sports.

[02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:34.340]
Did anybody mention Kirby Puckett?

[02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:35.200]
Yes.

[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:36.180]
What it is?

[02:33:36.180 --> 02:33:37.800]
You know what they say to Kirby Puckett?

[02:33:37.920 --> 02:33:39.180]
Just say, have a nice day.

[02:33:41.620 --> 02:33:44.440]
560, 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.160]
I apologize profusely, by the way,

[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:49.820]
because I have a very, you know,

[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:52.840]
I have an audience out there.

[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:54.800]
They're very susceptible to suggestion.

[02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:56.460]
And I talked about the...

[02:33:56.460 --> 02:33:58.480]
And the only reason I mentioned the advantage bars is because

[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:02.000]
I don't want to mention George was the one who turned me on to that again

[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.360]
about how Chris was buying those by the sackful

[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:06.500]
and about how whatever you said.

[02:34:07.100 --> 02:34:07.760]
By the sackful.

[02:34:07.940 --> 02:34:08.940]
And I keep asking her why.

[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:11.200]
You know what it tastes like a sackful of that?

[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:12.360]
It's what it tastes.

[02:34:12.580 --> 02:34:13.240]
And what does she say?

[02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:15.540]
She's got the cake you got to eat something.

[02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:16.320]
Why?

[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:18.100]
Oh, God.

[02:34:18.600 --> 02:34:19.180]
I'm serious.

[02:34:20.020 --> 02:34:22.340]
I would have my tongue just chopped.

[02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:24.220]
Just all the buds scraped off.

[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:26.740]
That's how bad they are.

[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:28.560]
Here's a mobile in Miami Lake.

[02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:28.860]
Hello?

[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:30.080]
Hey, Neil.

[02:34:30.300 --> 02:34:30.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:34:30.980 --> 02:34:32.060]
I don't know if you remember me.

[02:34:32.060 --> 02:34:36.860]
I'm the guy that gave you the big stack of cassettes one day in IOD.

[02:34:37.580 --> 02:34:38.120]
Sound effects?

[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:38.600]
Oh, yeah.

[02:34:38.720 --> 02:34:38.980]
How you doing?

[02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:40.220]
I'm doing fine.

[02:34:40.420 --> 02:34:43.960]
I just recently become diabetic myself.

[02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:46.880]
And I thought I would ask you a couple of questions.

[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:49.540]
What do you recommend for a snack?

[02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:51.440]
You know, like things with no carbs.

[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:55.500]
Because I've been looking at things and reading things very, very carefully lately.

[02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:58.440]
And like, for instance, I know I can drink diet coke.

[02:34:59.160 --> 02:34:59.740]
It's got a good heart.

[02:34:59.880 --> 02:35:00.420]
With no caffeine.

[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:01.240]
Right.

[02:35:01.580 --> 02:35:04.880]
But you say, right, make sure it's no caffeine diet coke.

[02:35:05.340 --> 02:35:05.660]
Okay.

[02:35:05.900 --> 02:35:09.260]
Because like, if you go on a plane or you go into a restaurant and you get diet coke,

[02:35:09.260 --> 02:35:10.740]
it's always going to be with caffeine.

[02:35:11.780 --> 02:35:12.040]
Okay.

[02:35:12.140 --> 02:35:15.120]
And a lot of people let screws up your whole diet and you're not going to lose any weight like me.

[02:35:15.740 --> 02:35:16.020]
Okay.

[02:35:16.100 --> 02:35:18.240]
Well, I'm 6'1 and 198.

[02:35:18.540 --> 02:35:23.660]
So, as weight is not a problem, it's just keeping my sugars regulated.

[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:24.140]
Right.

[02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:26.180]
Do you have any recommendations?

[02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:30.180]
I mean, I know that I can have like that sugar-free jello and stuff like that.

[02:35:30.180 --> 02:35:32.800]
And you have some slingsins or like, you know, cheese.

[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:34.600]
Okay.

[02:35:35.220 --> 02:35:35.500]
All right.

[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:36.520]
Well, not a lot.

[02:35:36.740 --> 02:35:39.520]
I mean, I wish I could tell you something really exciting, but there's not a lot.

[02:35:40.020 --> 02:35:40.320]
Yeah, no.

[02:35:40.340 --> 02:35:42.740]
My mom says I'm going to probably starving the rest of my life.

[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:43.820]
That's not true.

[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:45.140]
Well, it's true.

[02:35:45.140 --> 02:35:48.600]
Go on and get your go-to-root Christian and have one of those gigantic rib-eye steaks.

[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:49.260]
You won't be starving.

[02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:51.620]
Well, I also got to watch my cholesterol, too.

[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:52.560]
That's kind of...

[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:53.060]
Well, I see.

[02:35:53.180 --> 02:35:57.800]
And again, you've got the wrong doctor because the adkins diet in most cases reduces your cholesterol.

[02:35:57.800 --> 02:35:59.460]
See, you've been brainwashed, sir.

[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:02.260]
I feel I feel bad because obviously your doctor is a jackass.

[02:36:02.580 --> 02:36:03.500]
Oh, it's a...

[02:36:03.500 --> 02:36:04.120]
I noticed the...

[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:05.080]
No, he's looking...

[02:36:05.080 --> 02:36:05.980]
I want you to do me this.

[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:09.860]
Okay, it's only got a cost about three or four bucks because it's in paperback, five or six bucks.

[02:36:10.420 --> 02:36:12.300]
Go to your bookstore and get the adkins book.

[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:13.720]
I'm begging you to do it for yourself.

[02:36:14.300 --> 02:36:14.620]
Okay.

[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:16.400]
Dr. Rackens' new diet revolution.

[02:36:16.580 --> 02:36:18.640]
Even though you're not on a diet, it's the best thing.

[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:22.100]
Or, or better than yet since you are diabetic, go to the same bookstore.

[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:22.860]
It's hardcover.

[02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:23.600]
It's a little more expensive.

[02:36:24.060 --> 02:36:26.560]
Dr. Bernstein at the Diabetes Solution book.

[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:27.740]
Right up your alley.

[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:28.580]
Okay.

[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:29.440]
Trust me.

[02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:30.220]
All right.

[02:36:30.340 --> 02:36:32.180]
The best investment you ever made in your life.

[02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:33.360]
I appreciate it.

[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:34.020]
Okay, good luck, pal.

[02:36:34.300 --> 02:36:34.620]
Thanks, buddy.

[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:42.060]
Yeah, see, God, He does all these things because He works in mysterious ways that God, and I know I'll see in heaven, Dr. Mark.

[02:36:43.220 --> 02:36:44.900]
All the way up to yesterday's hour and a half over there.

[02:36:44.940 --> 02:36:45.800]
I don't think He'll be there.

[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:49.800]
I cannot word-discape me.

[02:36:50.260 --> 02:36:56.540]
Even a verbal tactician like yours truly cannot find the words to describe the hour and hour.

[02:36:56.540 --> 02:36:58.580]
And a half that I spent with my doctor yesterday.

[02:36:59.700 --> 02:37:04.040]
And when I walked out of there, I kept thinking to myself, who was the doctor and who was the patient?

[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:06.780]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:37:06.980 --> 02:37:07.120]
Hello.

[02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:08.340]
How you doing?

[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:09.840]
First time long time.

[02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:10.300]
Yes, sir.

[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:13.440]
And...

[02:37:15.380 --> 02:37:15.780]
And...

[02:37:15.780 --> 02:37:17.260]
He must have just got cut off.

[02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:18.580]
He must have just got flipped.

[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:23.520]
5670560, pound 562 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:24.540]
Here's Miami Lakes.

[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:24.820]
Hello.

[02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:27.240]
Hello, Neil Rogers speaking.

[02:37:27.540 --> 02:37:32.640]
I have heard you for a quite a long time now, and I finally decided to call you today.

[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:33.120]
Yes, sir.

[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:36.860]
The way you express yourself about God tells me one thing about your persona.

[02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:39.020]
You must have a very, very sad childhood.

[02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:39.640]
No, I did not.

[02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:43.100]
I'm pretty sure that your mom used to force you to go to synagogue.

[02:37:43.420 --> 02:37:44.020]
No, she did not.

[02:37:44.100 --> 02:37:45.460]
We were not religious at all, no.

[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:47.400]
My mom didn't force me to go, nor did she go.

[02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:48.480]
I mean, what...

[02:37:48.940 --> 02:37:49.300]
Incredible.

[02:37:49.300 --> 02:37:50.900]
The way you express yourself about God.

[02:37:51.100 --> 02:37:54.500]
Because, in other words, because I have a different opinion, I don't believe all of phony, baloney stuff that you do.

[02:37:54.500 --> 02:37:55.780]
It's not a matter of...

[02:37:55.780 --> 02:37:56.180]
What is it, sir?

[02:37:56.280 --> 02:37:57.440]
What is it incredible about?

[02:37:57.540 --> 02:37:58.520]
What's incredible about it, too?

[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:00.260]
Well, the bottom line is...

[02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:01.200]
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:02.700]
No, I don't believe in Santa Claus.

[02:38:02.700 --> 02:38:03.720]
Do you believe in the tooth fairy?

[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:04.760]
No, I don't.

[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:07.760]
Do you believe in the little green guy under the bed that got goblins?

[02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:08.500]
No, I don't.

[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:09.760]
No, I don't.

[02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:10.640]
Do you believe in angels?

[02:38:10.980 --> 02:38:11.600]
No, I don't.

[02:38:11.660 --> 02:38:13.020]
So then how do you believe in God?

[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:16.500]
Because of looking at the sky, looking at everything...

[02:38:18.180 --> 02:38:19.460]
Do you believe in nature?

[02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:20.860]
Of course, I believe in nature.

[02:38:20.860 --> 02:38:21.780]
What do you need God for?

[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:22.200]
Why do you guys...

[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:24.040]
Okay, then can you answer me one question?

[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:24.260]
No.

[02:38:24.980 --> 02:38:25.680]
What is it?

[02:38:25.820 --> 02:38:27.360]
How do I know if you're going to answer me the question?

[02:38:27.900 --> 02:38:28.780]
How did we get here?

[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:31.180]
I haven't got any idea, do you?

[02:38:31.220 --> 02:38:31.960]
I do read all of your...

[02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:34.060]
Do you know how we got here, sir?

[02:38:34.620 --> 02:38:36.740]
I know how we got here.

[02:38:36.820 --> 02:38:39.100]
Don't give me, of course, you know how we got here.

[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:40.540]
We were created.

[02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:42.700]
Do you know how we got here, sir?

[02:38:43.060 --> 02:38:43.740]
I'm telling you, sir.

[02:38:43.740 --> 02:38:44.060]
Let me tell you.

[02:38:44.060 --> 02:38:44.100]
Let me tell you.

[02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:44.880]
Don't tell me.

[02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:48.180]
Don't reach for an answer, because you know that I got you trapped into a box.

[02:38:48.540 --> 02:38:49.640]
Do you know how we got here?

[02:38:49.740 --> 02:38:50.200]
Yes or no?

[02:38:50.420 --> 02:38:50.640]
Yes.

[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:54.640]
And we were created by God, which is what?

[02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:56.240]
All powerful.

[02:38:56.500 --> 02:38:57.200]
It was good.

[02:38:57.320 --> 02:38:59.560]
Yeah, then how come we're eating that kind of bars?

[02:39:00.340 --> 02:39:01.340]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:03.120]
Check ass.

[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:04.860]
No, we were...

[02:39:04.860 --> 02:39:05.520]
We were created.

[02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:06.620]
How did we get here?

[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:07.680]
How did we get here?

[02:39:07.860 --> 02:39:08.720]
I mean, what are we going to do?

[02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:09.580]
What are we going to do?

[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:10.320]
How did we get here?

[02:39:11.060 --> 02:39:14.980]
Sir, you waste the rest of your life worrying about stupid questions like that.

[02:39:15.100 --> 02:39:15.720]
How did we get here?

[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:19.640]
And I'll worry about the rest of my life worrying about what am I going to do now that I'm here?

[02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:25.640]
Until that magical day went all-in because God works in mysterious ways.

[02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:31.440]
Just amazes him the disgusting way I speak about God, Danit.

[02:39:34.340 --> 02:39:37.960]
Several open lines, all of a sudden after that debacle, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:39:38.340 --> 02:39:40.580]
pound 5, 60 on the 18 and T wireless line.

[02:39:40.800 --> 02:39:47.940]
But don't forget, you know, snakes and mosquitoes and cockroaches and every kind of vermin under the sun, God made all of these things.

[02:39:47.940 --> 02:39:48.540]
And then some.

[02:39:50.600 --> 02:39:52.180]
We got 50 million open lines.

[02:39:52.300 --> 02:39:55.580]
Hank was just in here telling me about he almost had a coronary heronirp chandelar on here.

[02:39:55.720 --> 02:39:57.600]
I mean, we feel a lot better about that, Hank and I.

[02:39:58.360 --> 02:40:01.800]
Because we're like teenagers compared to urban if he's still around us, hope for all of us, baby.

[02:40:01.900 --> 02:40:06.740]
Oh! 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 18 and T wireless line.

[02:40:07.020 --> 02:40:09.140]
Let's hear from some more of the God people, okay?

[02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:10.260]
And I'll tell you one thing.

[02:40:10.340 --> 02:40:15.680]
If you ever you want to those advantage bars and you can call me afterwards and say you still believe in God, then I give you credit.

[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:19.560]
Then I'll say now there is somebody with the courage of their convictions.

[02:40:20.860 --> 02:40:21.780]
Here's for Lauderdale.

[02:40:21.900 --> 02:40:21.960]
Hello?

[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:23.180]
Uncle Neil.

[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:23.660]
Yes, sir.

[02:40:24.220 --> 02:40:28.220]
I had one of those brownie hounds and hound is definitely the operative word on that bar.

[02:40:28.420 --> 02:40:28.580]
Yeah.

[02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:30.540]
That was, as in...

[02:40:30.540 --> 02:40:30.900]
Backed up.

[02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:31.960]
Sorry.

[02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:32.420]
God.

[02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:34.120]
How could any...

[02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:36.320]
Seriously, you know, when you make a product, you know what I'm saying?

[02:40:36.740 --> 02:40:40.440]
When a company manufactures a product and they taste it.

[02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:42.480]
They experiment in the lab and they put all the ingredients together.

[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:46.180]
How could anybody have manufactured those things, you know?

[02:40:46.300 --> 02:40:46.980]
All these things.

[02:40:47.300 --> 02:40:50.400]
And tasted them and said, oh yeah, well the public will love these.

[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:51.760]
Let's package them now.

[02:40:51.900 --> 02:40:53.660]
One word, recycled toilet paper.

[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:54.700]
Oh, God.

[02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:57.120]
Even Mr. Whipple wouldn't touch these.

[02:40:57.460 --> 02:41:00.520]
Let me ask you a question about the Actions because I'm not really too familiar with it.

[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:02.900]
What do you think about like nuts?

[02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:04.900]
And I'm not making a joke about it.

[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:06.240]
I like nuts myself.

[02:41:07.100 --> 02:41:07.700]
But can you...

[02:41:07.700 --> 02:41:08.860]
Can you come any on what they're attached to?

[02:41:09.140 --> 02:41:11.080]
Can there are certain types that you can eat or could eat?

[02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:12.200]
I don't know.

[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:14.520]
I was looking at some of the packages and some of them with the care.

[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:15.620]
In fact, when it comes to nuts...

[02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:16.680]
They don't have a four-five-cars.

[02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:17.040]
It comes to nuts.

[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:17.980]
I always say...

[02:41:17.980 --> 02:41:19.120]
Ray Whitney has a pair.

[02:41:19.380 --> 02:41:22.760]
But anyway, well no, he in the book you'll tell you that you have to be careful.

[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:26.080]
You can have a limit of the nuts, but like, you know, a few cashews, a few macadamies.

[02:41:26.780 --> 02:41:28.440]
But you can't overdo it because they're loaded with carbohydrate.

[02:41:28.900 --> 02:41:31.460]
But they also got that coque-que...something?

[02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:32.260]
Coque-que-ten.

[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:33.780]
Yes, which is where you need.

[02:41:33.980 --> 02:41:34.540]
Which I'm taking.

[02:41:35.060 --> 02:41:35.660]
Which is excellent.

[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:36.200]
Which is great.

[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:36.520]
You're right.

[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:39.420]
But you can take that in a supplement without taking the carbohydrate.

[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:42.620]
So you're just looking to take the nuts as an excuse so that you can say,

[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:43.960]
oh, I'm taking it for the coque-que-ten.

[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:46.020]
I mean, a few nuts are okay, but don't overdo it.

[02:41:46.180 --> 02:41:50.440]
No, I mean, I'm not diabetic or I'm not, you know, extremely overweight or nothing.

[02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:52.920]
Why are you interested in the acupuncture?

[02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:57.040]
Because I don't like the all the sugars that I'm trying to lose some fat content.

[02:41:57.220 --> 02:42:01.700]
You know, bring it down from like 19 or 20 percent palephosphate down to 15 or 22 percent.

[02:42:01.760 --> 02:42:04.240]
Well, these athletes, the advantage bars of the way you won't eat for weeks.

[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:07.260]
You'll look like you're about crannin' about a month.

[02:42:08.860 --> 02:42:11.720]
You'll be skinny and thin.

[02:42:11.720 --> 02:42:12.300]
Okay, you know something.

[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:16.940]
I bet you the last solid meal at Karen Carpenter-Rate was the Dr. Rackens' advantage bar.

[02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:18.360]
I will never eat that again.

[02:42:18.500 --> 02:42:20.040]
I bet you that's what put her right over the edge.

[02:42:20.180 --> 02:42:24.060]
That was my last, I was, you know, in prison for murder and that was going to be my last meal.

[02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:25.580]
I just told him to go ahead and pull this way.

[02:42:25.660 --> 02:42:27.380]
Exactly. Just spin it over.

[02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:28.180]
Okay, pal.

[02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:32.240]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[02:42:32.380 --> 02:42:36.440]
Whoever turned us out of this crap, by the way, like Bernard Getz said,

[02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:37.340]
there's another one for it.

[02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:38.180]
I'm another one.

[02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:39.500]
Oh, man.

[02:42:40.260 --> 02:42:41.700]
Oh, but you got to try to cook it at once.

[02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:42.260]
It's really great.

[02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:43.340]
See, I'm sorry.

[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:44.440]
I'm a little bit reluctant.

[02:42:44.820 --> 02:42:48.400]
After eating these other two pluss of part of the turd, and I do mean...

[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:49.140]
You turd.

[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:51.380]
What was the third one?

[02:42:51.460 --> 02:42:52.700]
The peanut butter, a Dreck one?

[02:42:53.900 --> 02:42:54.940]
Peanut butter, diarrhea?

[02:42:56.400 --> 02:42:57.040]
Oh, God.

[02:42:57.620 --> 02:42:57.800]
Seriously.

[02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:01.280]
Just, I want you to think of the worst meal you've ever had in your life.

[02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:02.920]
If you can single one out.

[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:04.040]
We've all had some pretty bad...

[02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:08.360]
Think of the absolute worst swill that's ever been pulled off on you as a meal.

[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:10.640]
Multiply times a hundred.

[02:43:10.980 --> 02:43:12.780]
And now you're starting to get warm.

[02:43:13.060 --> 02:43:13.820]
You're not close yet.

[02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:15.100]
You're starting to get close.

[02:43:15.500 --> 02:43:16.600]
Just a little close.

[02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:20.980]
To just how grotesque, how terminal, how unbelievably bad.

[02:43:21.220 --> 02:43:24.360]
And now you see that guy that called you forward that is Mr. Fine or whatever you name was?

[02:43:24.740 --> 02:43:25.360]
Mr. Nato Fine?

[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:27.780]
He's going to be psychotic.

[02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:28.560]
Oh, my God.

[02:43:28.560 --> 02:43:29.200]
You're going to kill him.

[02:43:29.260 --> 02:43:30.880]
You know something I cannot tell a lie.

[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:32.240]
Not about the little lie, maybe.

[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:33.420]
But not a lie like this.

[02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:35.720]
You talk about credibility.

[02:43:37.460 --> 02:43:39.260]
Even Bubba's nose never grew that much.

[02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:40.420]
Oh, geez.

[02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:41.140]
I mean, this stuff.

[02:43:41.380 --> 02:43:42.780]
My dogs wouldn't touch these.

[02:43:43.540 --> 02:43:44.520]
Forget about with their mouth.

[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:45.440]
They wouldn't touch it with their...

[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:45.780]
Correct them.

[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:47.660]
No. They wouldn't come close to it.

[02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:50.160]
Here's a mobile in Lauderdale.

[02:43:50.300 --> 02:43:50.420]
Hello.

[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:51.980]
Hey, Neil. How are you?

[02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:52.480]
Okay, sir.

[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:54.820]
Yeah, I tried to, uh, advantage-wise.

[02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:58.360]
I'd say the cooking ideas probably the best of the bunch, but they are the worst.

[02:43:58.580 --> 02:43:59.960]
I mean, they truly are the worst.

[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:03.740]
The only thing that I've enjoyed out of that delight is their ice cream.

[02:44:04.220 --> 02:44:07.200]
But every time I eat that ice cream, I stop losing weight.

[02:44:07.300 --> 02:44:08.100]
I don't gain any weight.

[02:44:08.100 --> 02:44:08.240]
Yeah.

[02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:09.440]
I just stop losing weight.

[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:09.980]
Yeah, that's true.

[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:11.880]
But Delphine, Delights didn't make these.

[02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:14.780]
These are made by the Atkins before the Atkins program.

[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:15.640]
The ice cream themselves?

[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:17.080]
No, I'm talking about the advantage.

[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:18.020]
The advantage of it.

[02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:19.620]
Yeah, well, they sell a lot of the products in there.

[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:21.620]
And I've tried most of the stuff they carry.

[02:44:21.800 --> 02:44:21.940]
Yeah.

[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:25.240]
And, you know, I just assumed stick with the gelo.

[02:44:25.340 --> 02:44:27.480]
Even though I'm sick of it, I stick with the gelo.

[02:44:27.560 --> 02:44:28.780]
Sometimes I'll just eat the whipped cream.

[02:44:28.780 --> 02:44:29.260]
Yeah.

[02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:30.660]
I'll just stick the whipped cream in my mouth.

[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:30.780]
Okay.

[02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:32.340]
I need to just turn it over.

[02:44:32.460 --> 02:44:33.380]
You shake the whipped cream thing.

[02:44:33.460 --> 02:44:35.020]
I'll give one of those big ones with some of them.

[02:44:35.020 --> 02:44:35.680]
I have zero carbs.

[02:44:36.060 --> 02:44:37.680]
And you shake it up and it tilts an asshole down.

[02:44:37.780 --> 02:44:38.720]
You suck it right out of the tube.

[02:44:39.180 --> 02:44:39.740]
That's exactly what it is.

[02:44:39.740 --> 02:44:40.520]
And it's just stuck in there.

[02:44:40.520 --> 02:44:41.300]
It's part of the advantage bars.

[02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:44.800]
I don't know how he markets those things where people actually buy them.

[02:44:44.820 --> 02:44:45.680]
And they're expensive too.

[02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:46.560]
They're not cheap.

[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:48.600]
Oh, thank God I got these for free.

[02:44:49.140 --> 02:44:50.480]
Yeah, they're like three bucks a piece.

[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:51.680]
Are you serious?

[02:44:52.060 --> 02:44:52.460]
Yeah, they're not cheap.

[02:44:52.460 --> 02:44:53.200]
Three bucks a pop?

[02:44:53.380 --> 02:44:53.800]
Are you sure?

[02:44:53.880 --> 02:44:54.080]
Oh.

[02:44:55.020 --> 02:44:57.940]
And they also sell some, there's like a fluid they sell.

[02:44:57.940 --> 02:44:59.500]
It tastes like a data rate.

[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:02.940]
It's called a fat burner made by some place that we coral springs.

[02:45:03.740 --> 02:45:04.960]
And that's about pretty good.

[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:06.940]
Oh, I like that stuff.

[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:08.100]
Yeah, it's really good.

[02:45:08.180 --> 02:45:09.020]
But that's also expensive.

[02:45:09.420 --> 02:45:10.540]
I delivered to the plant.

[02:45:10.580 --> 02:45:11.660]
I drive a truck with it.

[02:45:11.860 --> 02:45:13.800]
My deliver to the place that manufactures that.

[02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:15.220]
But I do know what you're talking about.

[02:45:15.340 --> 02:45:16.240]
That's pretty good stuff.

[02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:16.960]
It's the best way.

[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:17.280]

[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:20.280]
But you know, all that diet stuff is expensive.

[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:21.080]
Right, yeah, it's crap.

[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:22.560]
Okay, good luck, Val.

[02:45:22.700 --> 02:45:23.080]
Good luck, Val.

[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:23.780]
Good luck, good luck, good luck.

[02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:24.740]
Okay, see ya.

[02:45:24.800 --> 02:45:25.220]
Thank you, Ariel.

[02:45:26.140 --> 02:45:27.060]
Good luck to us all.

[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:27.920]
Like little tiny two.

[02:45:27.920 --> 02:45:32.020]
And Tim said, because God has, the big fix is in.

[02:45:32.060 --> 02:45:33.540]
Okay, if you like it, you're going to get sick.

[02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:34.280]
You're going to get fat.

[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:35.240]
You're going to die.

[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:37.800]
Because that's the way God works.

[02:45:37.980 --> 02:45:39.660]
Because like I keep telling you over and over again,

[02:45:39.940 --> 02:45:41.440]
he's one sadistic mother, baby.

[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:44.520]
He just sitting up there, laughing up his sleeve.

[02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:47.320]
In fact, if you pick up one of those, you go into your bookstore.

[02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:50.540]
And pick up one of those disease books, you know, that's got, well,

[02:45:50.540 --> 02:45:51.540]
it's mainly for physicians.

[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:53.680]
But if you're a hypokondriac like I am,

[02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:55.340]
you can sit around and kill a lot of good time at home,

[02:45:55.480 --> 02:45:56.840]
reading about all these various diseases.

[02:45:56.840 --> 02:45:58.800]
Every time you have like a little pain, oh, you know,

[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:01.940]
and you'll open that thing up and you'll be astonished

[02:46:01.940 --> 02:46:06.380]
in all the thousands and thousands and thousands of diseases

[02:46:07.260 --> 02:46:09.760]
that exist, things that you never heard of before.

[02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:11.720]
And don't forget, God made all of these things.

[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:12.240]
That's right.

[02:46:13.900 --> 02:46:15.740]
Well, he gets pissed off every now and then, you know.
