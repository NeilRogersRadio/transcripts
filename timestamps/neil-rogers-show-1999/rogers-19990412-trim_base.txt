Everybody say, fun.

[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.840]
The restroom smells like roses.

[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.280]
You need to be in the cage.

[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.520]
But I'm not the only one who use the restroom today.

[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.400]
I will go see him there for a few minutes.

[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.320]
I will go see him there for a few minutes.

[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.760]
I will go see him there for a few minutes.

[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.120]
I will go see him there for a few minutes.

[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:41.140]
I will go see him there for a few minutes.

[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:53.100]
I will go see him there for a few minutes.

[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.340]
When I get my hands on who's crazy room,

[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.900]
I'll stop at his face.

[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.040]
I'll go the restroom smells like roses.

[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.460]
When ever I can feel it smells okay to me.

[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.280]
I don't do it 550 WQM,

[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.320]
but that overhead sure is low today, boys

[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.640]
and girls it's real real low but anyway we'll get you it one way or the other

[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.860]
speaking of doing a little lumber I got another great story most people don't

[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.860]
admit these stories when they happen to them because it only happens to me

[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:42.220]
okay nobody else will admit this just another little episode in life proving

[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.360]
that there is no god so yesterday morning we're in Toronto I got all kinds of

[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.620]

[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.520]
rumor like I can't see him anytime and he's up there waving and gesticulating

[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.760]
and all I mean just putting a lot of handbone but not as bad as Christina Moron by

[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.580]
the way they're seeing them the national anthems and I look up in a press box

[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.260]
and there's a rumor into the spot fan into their right there's Bob

[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.000]
Kohl and Harry Neal doing a game on TV on TVC into their right is Joe Bowen

[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.100]

asshole during the national anthem and he's waving like an orchestra he's

[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.820]
carrying on and sweating and putting on a whole big act for a guilty and Randy

[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.400]
Moler it's Christina Moron acting like a real jerk and I thought what a moron

[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.140]
yeah it's what I thought I thought to myself he's an asshole but we already

[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.900]
know that that Christina Moron God you had a seat to believe it so anyway we'll

[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.640]
get back to that in a minute but now yes any morning every Sunday morning they

[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.360]
have a great brunch this is a place next to the Eaton Center Eaton is the big

[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.940]
department store in Toronto like Burdhines and there's a big shopping mall

[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.100]
downtown called the Eaton Center and right next to it is a place called JJ

[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.600]
Mugs which is the very it looks like one of those like Daltz remember Daltz

[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.260]
like kind of a restaurant and during like any other time of the week it's

[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.720]
mediocre at best but Sunday morning they have the best goddamn brunch from

[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.440]
like 10 30 to 3 every Sunday so anytime we're in Toronto on the weekend and

[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.160]
happen to be there on Sunday morning never miss this Sunday brunch now one of

[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.720]
the things I love about it is they have like an omelette bar where the guy

[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.460]
makes you omelette fresh you know to whatever you want on it well one of the

[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.880]
things they do when they make the omelette of course what are they put in the

[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:20.800]
pan before they make the omelette what I don't hear what you're saying I'm

[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.840]
sorry I'm like a phone oil put oil in the pan right well I'm not thinking to

[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.100]
myself that you know 10 30 on a Sunday morning little oil in the pan might you

[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.940]
know what I'm thinking so we finish eating there and I'm like just before I

[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.760]
finish I make a trip to the immense room up there in in the JJ Mugs because I

[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.480]
thought yeah did my business I thought I did all of my business much to my

[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.040]
this made a find out moments later I did not so we walk out of there and the

[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.340]
walking through the Eaton Center and I said to John I say you know I think I

[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.280]
better go find because I know where the restrooms are downstairs in the food

[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.520]
court so he goes off in the music store and I said I'll be right back because

[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.840]
nature was calling for a repeat performance okay now we're off at one end this

[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.480]
is a big shopping mall by the way we're at one end of it the restrooms you go down

[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.820]
three escalators all the way to the bottom floor and they're way at the other end

[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:18.220]
on the very bottom floor and I'm moving along thinking no problem I get right

[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.560]
to where the door is right to the door you know what I'm talking about right to

[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.720]
the door and your mind is playing tricks with your body again and like oh no

[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.840]
don't and I take one step and oh no a little little bit of a problem and I

[00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:40.930]
well I'll still make it I take the next step and oh boy well thank God for

[00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:49.490]
boxer shorts baby yeah white boxers shorts no less yeah white boxes oh man so I

[00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.970]
fly into there I do my business and of course now I'm also I'm removing my

[00:06:53.970 --> 00:07:00.050]
boxer shorts now this is a busy restroom it's a busy tea room so it's not

[00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.610]
like one of those situations where you can go in and like daintily take them

[00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:09.190]
off and like throw them in the trash can almost have the shot camera well that's

[00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:15.870]
what it is right so I had to fold them up kind of like you know and stick them

[00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.550]
under behind the base of the toilet you know what I'm saying you know where

[00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.710]
there's that one spot it's like a blind spot where the Italians hide the guns

[00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:29.870]
right where the Cuban women hide the old toilet paper oh my god

[00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:35.970]
what another experience I thought to myself God damn it there is no God

[00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.650]
what that's it that's the end of that story but wouldn't brief be more efficient

[00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.410]
for holding that stuff in no no not at all because briefs tend to be number one

[00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.990]
thinner yeah which means that we go through into your pantaloonies you have like a

[00:07:52.990 --> 00:08:00.270]
bad stain in number two oh jeez the thought of that but boxer shorts are more

[00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.370]
like there's more different places working catch on briefs are very

[00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.550]
skimpy it's like almost like we're in a jockstrap which you can just imagine if

[00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:21.270]
you were wearing a oh jeez what's that on the floor oh boy talk about a crappy

[00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:25.970]
life so that was one of the highlights before the snowstorm by the way that

[00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.970]
was that was the first storm okay a couple hours later there was another

[00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.070]
storm of a different kind was a real adventure this weekend it's always an

[00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.510]
adventure when you get out of here when you're here it's pretty boring you know

[00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.650]
but you get on a plane you go someplace else it's always an adventure so I

[00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.390]
trying to call my doctor doctor mark which by the way I'll be there an hour

[00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.910]
earlier today doctor mark because we got Marlon's baseball at 105 can you believe

[00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:53.270]
that no Marlon to the match in New York Marlon's baseball any interest at all

[00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.890]

[00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:02.730]
figures on the games over the weekend yesterday on a Sunday on a beautiful

[00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:08.230]
sweltering Sunday when it was 94 in the shade Alex Fernandez pitching the hero

[00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:12.430]
you know come back after last year the big hero picks that great game opening

[00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:17.870]
day oh yes the Cubans the law come out no Alex Fernandez's pitch it no and

[00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:22.110]
announced crowd of 14,000 some odd I bet you you know basically because that's

[00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.910]
ticket sold maybe they had like 10 or 12,000 people in there on a Sunday afternoon

[00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.950]
hey to break the news to you John Henry are they interested no they're gonna be

[00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:36.270]
any interest no none zero zip it do that I whoop my poop I I I I pooped my pants

[00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.630]
hi this is Richie Simmons and since you haven't been sending me money for

[00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:46.270]
anything lately I developed a big load of new diet merchandise like my

[00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.030]
sweating to the oldies video then you'll laugh I use sweating to the oldies the

[00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.950]
odorant when I work out honey I put out a sense that could strip the bark off our

[00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.470]
redwood so don't offend while you've been get my yogurt stick and you like my

[00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:03.190]
deal of meal then you'll laugh I do Richie Simmons I a poker game you play deal

[00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.110]
with your friends and you know all their food and I've got a new line of work out

[00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.630]
underpants I'm hoping we guarantee you lose weight because after listening to

[00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.090]
Richie Simmons because ten minutes you won't be able to keep anything down

[00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:20.970]
anything down 15 to 5 50 WQ I was just thinking I bet you there are a few I

[00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.350]
should be in the Guinness Book of Records how many other people do you know who

[00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.550]
have cracked their pants in Miami Toronto and Rome huh all three of the above

[00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:33.730]
not anybody know anybody else out there no that's done that no I knew I'd

[00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:39.450]
leave my mark on this world before I left it make no mistake about that so

[00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.610]
anyway getting back to the inevitable the air Canada Center and our trip

[00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:46.050]
now I will say this man just like you old Boston Garden in Boston where you

[00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.870]
could take the subway and get off right inside the garden without even having

[00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.150]
to go outside same thing with the air Canada Center you take the subway to

[00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.310]
Union Station you get off and you don't even have to go outside you walk right

[00:10:55.310 --> 00:11:00.430]
through and there you are in the air Canada Center just follow the sign beautiful

[00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:07.250]
building spectacular brand new you know plastic much much better food than the

[00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:11.250]
Macarena I mean much more different variety much much better food it all kind

[00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:16.490]
of food but the aisles the walkways up in the you know in the walkway to

[00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:21.850]
narrow much to narrow jam packed with people out there and then you go inside

[00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:27.670]
like I said Rimmer gets us real real real real crappy seats I mean really you

[00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.290]
know the price was right right there were free but you might as well sit

[00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:34.250]
close enough to be able to see the game it's kind of like the goals that are

[00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.810]
being scored at the other end which the least with those five goals in the

[00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:41.850]
first two periods all were most mostly at the other end and you need

[00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.430]
binoculars to see what's going on oh there's the red light at least you can

[00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.870]
see the light come on but other than that you can't really see what's going on

[00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:52.550]
down there way on the end bad and unfortunately the bad news is that thanks to

[00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.310]
Gary Batman thanks to the sports moguls and all professional sports they're

[00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:01.590]
just strong it's not only new arenas and new ball parks and new stadiums but

[00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.730]
it's they all have to be the same they all have to be equally plastic and so on

[00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:09.030]
the big scoreboard there it's generalized horrible acoustics by the way the

[00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:14.570]
worst in the world they they play the same corny crap there that we see at

[00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.690]
the macarena thank you Gary Batman you jackass you stupid little Jew you idiot

[00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.950]
you know the thing with Gene Hackman that seems in the locker room and they're

[00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.230]
doing the applause the one thing I will say though in Toronto though those are

[00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.930]
very polite people don't get them going here they get sucked into that doesn't

[00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:36.010]
face them at all they don't start applauding they're they're busy in a coma we

[00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.910]
stayed for two periods of course you know the outcome of the game Toronto one nine

[00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.290]
to one if I would have known they were gonna score four more in the third I'm

[00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:46.770]
out of state and every time to leave score I jump up I'm screaming and I'm

[00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.450]
looking around now I realize the crowd in Toronto they're like I said they're

[00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:54.390]
very polite I think even when they shoot you they say oh sorry sir here you go

[00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:59.810]
really the two polite but I mean the people in the air can of the center they're

[00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:05.170]
not just polite they're in a coma they're in a coma baby I look around

[00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:09.630]
everybody sitting yeah but we just scored a goal hey we just got yeah okay and

[00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.150]
now what they're doing is like in the red seats I don't know about all the

[00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.070]
other sections they got platinum seats they got the gold which used to be the

[00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.310]
best at Maple Leaf Gardens they got the red and then the shluppers way up

[00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:22.190]
there with the Mount Palomar telescopes and the binoculars in the green seats way

[00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:29.590]
up there a million miles in the sky and they have the the usherette school

[00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.230]
around like to do a pp park with their little order taking and they are a

[00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:40.030]
little computer and they take orders for food while a game is going on so

[00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:44.050]
people are passing money back and forth and passing credit cards so not only are

[00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.230]
people getting up and walking back and forth which you never used to see this

[00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:52.090]
at Maple Leaf Gardens but now they're passing stuff back and forth and food back

[00:13:52.090 --> 00:14:01.130]
and forth and just incessantly goes on and on and never ends just tragic very

[00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:05.470]
sad I mean it plays looks nice but they've totally destroyed the atmosphere and

[00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.350]
there you can't complain about the atmosphere in this building there isn't any

[00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:13.110]
there is none zero like I said the sound system blows they aren't blasting it

[00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:18.330]
that got out they can get it they allowed to blast it it was just other than

[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.760]
the outcome of the game for me other than that it was just depressing very

[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.180]
depressing all the same garbage up on a scrubber all the same music that

[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.100]
that that that that you know this is what it's all becoming I was thinking to

[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:39.180]
myself why I'm serious about this why do we go to sporting events that are on

[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:46.400]
television for free huh seriously that's that's a magnificent question like for

[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.640]
example the Panthers have two more home games Wednesday against Montreal which

[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:54.160]
I'm still debating about that Saturday against Tampa Bay against the lightweight

[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.200]
the last home game of the season I'm not gonna be going to that no not not on

[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.960]
your life I'd rather stay home and take seeds out of my back and we'll go watch

[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:08.260]
the lightning in the Panthers but seriously why do we go they keep building all

[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.960]
these stadiums in the arenas and it becomes less and less appealing fewer and

[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.060]
fewer of the people who go there just like at the Macarena have any interest in

[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.540]
the sporting event that's going on there there is smooth it's a social event or

[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:25.600]
maybe somebody gave them the tickets they've got any idea what's going on and

[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.580]
you've got drunks and you've got assholes and all just the same old tired stuff

[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.460]
and the other doing it the your Canada Center to they put the people up there

[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.540]
in the scoreboard and they're not not as rock as it is here of course because

[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.540]
they're two polite but they're you know making assholes out of themselves

[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:45.820]
there I am on the big screen hey let me see if I can be an asshole hey why why

[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.660]
I mean television most sports on including hockey unless you were more on

[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.480]
all these people say oh I can't see the puck well there it is it's that big

[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.560]
black thing there any ice you asshole they they televised magnificently and

[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.460]
they do a sensational job of covering the event and you don't have to worry

[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.160]
about if you're sitting a million miles away and you can't see what's going on

[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.000]
I can't I can't think of any sporting event in the world that I can't see

[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.740]
much much better on my big screen TV on my Sony XBR with my big dish and my

[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:20.700]
small satellite dish and the cable virtually every goddamn game is on there

[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:27.240]
why do why do people go what's the point huh no that's yours I mean I give my

[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:33.060]
tickets for free there was a time like with the dolphins five years I paid

[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:38.660]
every year I've you know paid the schmuck for the dolphin tickets and there was

[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.740]
also a time on the first couple of years two three years with a panthers paid

[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:49.760]
for my season tickets very expensive would I pay now no I get the tickets for

[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.720]
free and I'll be honest with you it's a real chore and then the arena is like

[00:16:53.720 --> 00:17:01.040]
four or five minutes drive away from my house and it's still a chore I still

[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:06.080]
have to motivate myself to be interested to go and know when it gets to be

[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.360]
another one of these and most of the games are boring I mean really coma

[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:17.840]
inducing terminal oh you could die from it and I find myself recently like in the

[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.960]
last month or so if the other team gets up like two nothing or something like

[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.360]
that praying for them to pop another quick goal or two in there so it can be

[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:30.300]
like so lopsided we know the outcome and we can leave early I just fly out

[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.300]
there when it gets to a certain point I just like somebody just turned on the

[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.940]
electric current and the electric cheer and I just zap up out of that

[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:42.580]
cheer and fly out of that place and I heard this you know D.

[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.740]
Faux but nice call by the way D. Faux wreck them do it now see that was a

[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:51.080]
14 slip doing so all this morning I sure hope Joe isn't sick enough they

[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.980]
have to take into that clinic you know they'll fix him up good there but D.

[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.820]
Faux was talking about how boring and terminally NFL draft isn't about

[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.880]
the draft next what assholes they are I thought D. Faux finally grew a little

[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.920]
period right about that but the first caller I heard on the morning show this

[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.000]
morning was chronic Joe you know with the thick voice chronic sports Joe you

[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.840]
you would know oh god I'll be hearing him in my sleep after I'm in the box I'll

[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.480]
still be hearing that voice and then some bitch calls in and she's going to all

[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.020]
I've been to two Marla games they won both games but what are we gonna do about

[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.920]
those crowds nobody seems to care there's no way what are we gonna do I thought

[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.280]
to myself yeah what are we gonna do what do we get over it honey nobody's

[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.080]
interested they don't care that's what we're gonna do is they're worried about

[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.840]
something more important than a stupid ball game which we have the Marlon to

[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.340]
the match by the way today at 105 or she let us out of here an hour early that's

[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:47.740]
why we care about it nobody cares and the sports nerds failed to recognize

[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.120]
this that more and more of this these big plastic facilities millions and

[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.400]
millions and millions of dollars being spent and I don't know I still don't

[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.840]
understand what's the big attraction why do people go when you can see it I

[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:07.060]
if it couldn't see it for free if there was no TV then maybe I might understand I

[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.900]
don't know about your house but in my house my living room my family room where

[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.120]
I have the big screen TV much much more comfortable than being in any arena

[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.400]
or stadium much more comfortable I can go to the refrigerator I can get

[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.060]
whatever refreshments of my choice the prices right the food is already there I

[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.300]
can get so does I can go take a leak without fighting crowds like I had to do

[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.240]
between periods in Toronto the other night you can sit in your underwear sit around

[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.100]
and you're underwear you can even you're underwear nobody will smell it that's

[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:39.140]
right I mean why do we go why why are we out of our minds are we nuts

[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.860]
what was the big attraction there I'm really I really am depressed about their

[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.780]
air canada center I would have thought I mean the building is beautiful don't get

[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.560]
me wrong and if it weren't for those narrow hallways out there where the

[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.160]
contestants are if they would have done that a little bit better it would be

[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:59.040]
perfect from the air every other standpoint but if a sterile is the inside of

[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.360]
an oxygen tent I mean there's no atmosphere and there never will really be

[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:07.720]
I don't think I mean just a big place with a lot of people and very very I

[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.980]
I can't imagine that too many people in that joint are really getting great

[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.860]
sight lines I mean there can have to be out of the 18,800 that the thing holds

[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.700]
for hockey they have to be about at least 12,000 of them who are not getting to

[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.740]
hurry good view of what's going on I must they have binoculars I mean it's far

[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.900]
far away I mean way the goal of the other hand we're sitting in the corner

[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:33.180]
behind the leaf shoot one squad I guess you'd call it and the goal of the

[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.140]
other end it looked like you were looking down the end of a tube at the end of a

[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:42.200]
tunnel that's how far away the other end looked and the goal of be

[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.840]
coordinated little you see that you can see the red light and the green light

[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.800]
they're up there out of glass on an unencumbered and uncovered like unlike

[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.780]
here but you can't really see what's going on there way way far down there

[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.240]
I mean I don't understand since they would normally to care about the fans

[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.920]
anyway I'm looking at some of the seats in the upper deck in the green section

[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.860]
I mean way up in a corner so far and so steep that if anybody takes a bad

[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:11.340]
step look out maybe that can be some extra added you know instead of that

[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.180]
stupid stuff they do it between periods with little kids playing hockey and

[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:19.140]
with all that other throwing a crap up in a crowd maybe they can do that have a

[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.860]
contest to see the cooking rig the most beers without tumbling out of the

[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.760]
upper deck down on the ice and then if they do everybody then we'll get some

[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:30.840]
reaction from the crowd it's it's sterile it's just not that enjoyable and

[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:36.580]
people convince themselves oh we're having a great time baby sit home you watch

[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.620]
that thing on TV you see everything up close and personally get the added

[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.800]
effect if you got good nonsense doing the game I mean you know it's an

[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:48.120]
enjoyable experience and we keep me you know and I used to I confess I used to

[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.080]
be one of those same people oh you got to go out and support the team you got

[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:57.440]
why why do you have to do that chicken have a bunch of drunks fill in

[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:02.260]
beer all over you getting into brawl's in front of you have a bunch of and

[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.740]
then by the way I've been to many hockey games that may believe gardens of

[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.040]
Toronto where people actually were paying attention to game yes what hockey

[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.420]
fans the people behind me the women they're doing the same crap that I have it

[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:16.000]
to Macarena that that that that the whole game they're talking about nothing

[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.400]
that has to do with the game and the food is going back and forth and we're

[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.700]
passing credit cards down to the end of the line and money back and forth and got

[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:30.340]
me two visas and one master card by the way deal Rogers and now the league of

[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.080]
greeners don't make fun they were very hard for this

[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.120]
game

[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.700]
so let's hear it today you want to go to the games you want to sit at home and watch

[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:28.220]
him free on TV huh why do you go why do we go why do we get in our cars why

[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.920]
do we hop on a subway why do we go to these the venues why do we spend a hell

[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.760]
of a lot of money or even if somebody gives us the tickets and by all of

[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.740]
that overpriced food and put up with all the other book grab and can't see

[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.780]
about eighty percent of what's going on what is the point I think it's a

[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.060]
magnificent question will he answer it today no probably not here's

[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:50.440]
book a hello yeah no I've been to air can this and it's nothing like what

[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.180]
you're describing is exactly like what I just described and everything you call

[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:59.440]
Gary Batman stupid you what are you stupid you what are you yeah ah

[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.200]

stuck out if you stuck a compass in a road map inside of his rectum uh-huh there's

[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.420]
a good call for you the air Canada Center of Boys and Girls the void of any kind

[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.040]
in fact I'm not just making that up they've been writing about that in all

[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.440]
the Toronto papers they all say the same thing there's no atmosphere in

[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.940]
here man it it wreaks of death in there they've got the foster hew up memorial

[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:27.780]

[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.800]
man in fact all through the hallways up there even remember mentioned to me

[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.120]

[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.160]
like you have to answer to somebody I mean you do whatever how you want yeah you

[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.160]
don't get up you don't feel beer anybody don't want to throw beer on you no

[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.700]
white is complaining there's no yentos there's no uh... TV time I said there's a

[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.840]
TV time I you put on HBO right that's why you do a channel serving and you

[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.520]
you don't have to sit there and wait wait for something to happen and you can't

[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.480]
beat it you cannot beat it the other day I could see that you couldn't really do

[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.800]
it this is hockey I don't I mean I'm not a big hockey fan but I guess I would have

[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.200]
to be there why I was very interested but I guess if you really into it like you

[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.360]
was good and you enjoy it but I used to say that that nobody really enjoys the

[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.900]
hockey game till they've been to one live but with what's going on in these

[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.040]
arenas now I mean the whole they've killed it they've destroyed the atmosphere

[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.420]
in the ambiance it's nothing like what it used to be

[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:25.180]
but it's been a fan I mean nobody can go sit down and take all on the morning

[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.200]
fifty dollars right right

[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:28.580]
exactly okay

[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:34.060]
how do I make my show next one there you go there's a guy make some sense why do we go

[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.660]
in fact I guarantee I'll come over again those tickets for the a pan through

[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.260]
the Tampa game on Saturday I'm not going to that in fact I'm gonna say right

[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.320]
now those and there will be a lot of people maybe they'll even sell a place

[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.520]
after that but I can't imagine why not just because they've lost seven role

[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.600]
because they're so far out of hand they're because they suck okay not just for

[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.680]
that reason but why would you make the effort to go someplace to be bored like

[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:01.720]
you like you're compelled to go like you're gonna feel guilty if you don't show

[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:07.060]
up or some stupid thing like that I don't feel compelled to go if I want to

[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.820]
watch a good hockey game on Saturday I got my two satellites this year I guarantee

[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:15.300]
I'll find one it won't be in the Macarena watching two tragic teams see that

[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.700]
this is what's going on now they keep watering it down and all professional

[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.100]
sports watering it down at expansion and expansion expansion so the product has

[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.420]
become so mediocre and that's why they have to sell all the the flash to go

[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.900]
along with it that's that's like this NFL drafting that's what that's all

[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:36.160]
about and then you had to have to the man they have created an event out of

[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:41.880]
nothing anyway this big what is that I don't want to hear that promo okay that's

[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.080]
stupid promo oh yeah we'll be wrapped up we'll be taking baths in the NFL

[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.340]
draft they'll be drafting guys that haven't been born yet with names that nobody

[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.740]
even their mother can't pronounce

[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.880]
that's just a big hype job okay to try it because it's a substitute for quality

[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.940]
like all the stuff that goes on with your rain you see shooting the t-shirt

[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.700]
something in the crowd and the little blimp is going around and people are

[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.160]
running and screaming and knocking each other down and then the music you know

[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.400]
and all this look I couldn't believe the same corny clips the same cornball

[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:17.020]
film clips on the center ice scoreboard now I will grant you that when a team

[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.700]
came out for the lion for the warm-ups that they did a much better job than

[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.260]
here because actually there are people that understand who the players are

[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.940]
and what the game is all about so they would like do close-ups Matt Sundin one

[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.060]
goal away from his 30th of the season and they they would show you stats about

[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:35.200]
the various players courtes Joseph you know stuff like that but once the game

[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.600]
started baby it was all it all exactly the same all like out of a cookie cutter

[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.800]
for the whole league now every arena's got to look the same every scoreboard has

[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.060]
got to have the same crap on it the music so I got to be that that that that

[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:55.740]
you know all that same gerry glitter garbage they've killed it here's a mobile

[00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:03.140]
in pember time hello okay sir the similar thing to the pantopetrol or

[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.560]
the breach of the game now they haven't got they haven't sunk that low yet now

[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:12.420]
that's that's what I was afraid of that if they get that low then you know that

[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:17.780]
it seems like all sports is seeming to go that way yeah I think only one game

[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.440]
this season and I went when the dancers played the devils and I enjoyed

[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:26.960]
myself but you know it is becoming it's it's they want to keep it's just families

[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.680]
and the little kids there and it seems like the adults are becoming little kids

[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:37.580]
too and I'm unfortunate I'm sick and tired of it could you I have a request

[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:42.720]
could you play the hockey mat in Canada theme no five six seven oh five 60

[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.720]
pound five 60 on a mobile one line why would I play the hockey mat in

[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.180]
Canada theme what is that all about of course not pound five 60 on a mobile one

[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:55.120]
line let's do a full-blown pinecrest hello how you doing sir can the

[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.860]
group of these pointy events you know what it is just these people have no

[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:03.840]
lives at all they work all day boring jobs and it's just they got they got

[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:08.620]
someone to go at night you know what I'm saying yeah yeah I mean all year long

[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.300]
I've been asking about the people in our in our arena the macarine and why

[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.460]
a lot of them are there because it's obvious they have no interest in the

[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.180]
game they're not paying any attention to it they show it seems like they

[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.080]
show up whenever they feel like it and they leave it the most bizarre times

[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.800]
not just because the game is lopsider but I have no idea I just don't

[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.880]
understand why people go to these things like I'm saying they're lives they're

[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.500]
basically stuck you know and they just want to let them know that they're going

[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.420]
to game at night just to say that they got something to do but it's ridiculous I

[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:38.160]
wouldn't go if they if they do if we take it I wouldn't go good for you pal

[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:44.940]
well if we took it buddy I knew that was coming we wanted to test we should

[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.740]
have tested them there huh hey sir you want those tickets no he wouldn't

[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:53.060]
say then he grabbed them in a heartbeat five six seven oh five sixty pound five

[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.820]
sixty on the mobile one line our usual spectacular response here this morning on

[00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:01.660]
a Monday and see this is the wrong station for this anyway just like D-fo was

[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.300]
pumping that thing this morning about the NFL draft blowing and being a

[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:08.500]
hype job and a bunch of crap wrong station for that boy anybody have a heart

[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.540]
or a liver

[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.220]
or

[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:10.740]
I

if

[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.280]
I'm gonna

[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.260]
I'm gonna

[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:19.260]

[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.260]
if

[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:20.560]
if

[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.840]
if

[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:29.860]
if

[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:30.420]
if

[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:30.580]

[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.380]
if

[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:31.380]

[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:31.380]

[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.380]
if

[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:37.940]
if

[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.660]
if

[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:46.160]
if

[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.600]
if

[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:48.600]

if

[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:52.940]

[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.820]
if

[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:06.320]
And together at least until you take up his I wanna wrap on his around your clothing tube

[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.620]
And make your wonder where the flow is moving

[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:15.580]
That's our miracle and it's on the circus side

[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:19.300]
He R E C D I O B

[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:22.420]
I wanna drink our balls

[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.800]
He R E D D I O B

[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.720]
1045 at 560 WQ

[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.760]
We got Marlon's baseball coming up at 105

[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.060]
Everybody interested at all

[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:32.600]
Any uh...

[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.620]
No, of course not

[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.680]
I mean that's brought the kids on there this morning with D-fo

[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.580]
What do we get to do?

[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.180]
You know, go to the library, read a book

[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.960]
Go to borders or bars and nobles and sit down and read a book

[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.460]
You know, for free if you're too cheap to buy

[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.040]
I want to sit there and have some macapagino

[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.220]
And read a magazine or a book or something

[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.820]
Go do anything, go out and get some fresh air

[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:52.920]
Go find a life

[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.080]
Okay, I was saying to read a break to George

[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.380]
Like the same thing with auto racing and what's the other one?

[00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.760]
There's one other one too, it's the same thing

[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.220]
Where you see almost nothing of what's going on?

[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:02.660]
Golf?

[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.060]
Oh, forget it, look, I wouldn't even dignify those people

[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.340]
I will not discuss people like go to golf tournaments

[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:11.100]
Those people need serious psychiatric assistance

[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.980]
Okay, oh, but it's the masters

[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.480]
Wow, who's gonna wear the green jacket?

[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.860]
And by the way, a guy named Maria

[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.600]
Yeah, the guy that won his name is Jose Maria Schwartz

[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.580]
or whatever this guy's name is

[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.880]
What kind of a middle name is that?

[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:23.380]
Maria

[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:24.820]
Huh?

[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.240]
Is that like Jose Sally Aganzales?

[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.160]
I mean, what is the most kind of a name is Maria?

[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.240]
For a guy

[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.620]
Because I'm telling you, the guy's middle name is F and Maria, okay?

[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.240]
Maybe they wanted a girl

[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.780]
Auto racing is one of them

[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.740]
And there's one other one I can't think of at the moment

[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:41.400]
It's flipped my mind

[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.420]
But it's the same thing

[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:46.240]
You people go as hundreds of thousands of people go to any

[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.360]
They go to a Daytona

[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.160]
And they sit there, what percentage of what's going on?

[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.680]
The action that they really see

[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.300]
Assuming that it's worth seeing in the first place

[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.260]
Just will agree on that for the sake of argument

[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.160]
What do they see?

[00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.500]
No, unless you're saying

[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.980]
What percentage of the actual race do they see?

[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.620]
Or if they're rooting for a particular driver

[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.160]
How often do they see him?

[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.540]
How many minutes he laps before they see him come around

[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.240]
for the next lap?

[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.060]
Out of the 50,000 laps that they're running

[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.220]
10%

[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.100]
Well, yeah, 10% maybe

[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.020]
See another great thing about sitting home and watching it on TV

[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.320]
Whatever the sporting event is

[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.680]
If it turns out to be crappy

[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.280]
You're turning something else on

[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.680]
Or you get up and you go out and get some fresh air

[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:27.520]
Or you get laid

[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.740]
Or something more worthwhile than sitting there watching it

[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:34.080]
Which is a hell of a lot easier than having to get up and slip out in the park

[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.440]
And find your car

[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.320]
You know, you know what I'm saying?

[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:38.960]
See the real answer

[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.300]
And I've been saying this for years is pay per view

[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.140]
For all sporting events

[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.600]
For everything, no more free TV

[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.700]
Not a lot of money

[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.620]
You know, maybe three bucks

[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.020]
Three bucks a game

[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.820]
You can watch any telecast you want

[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.000]
Hockey games, basketball games, football games

[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.220]
Three, four bucks a game

[00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.340]
I'd be willing to pay it

[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.740]
Right there in the comfort of your living room

[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.060]
As opposed to going into these places

[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.780]
And then I don't understand what it is

[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.380]
I still don't get the people in that macarena

[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.300]
I'll never figure that out

[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.540]
They like it, they're masochists

[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:13.900]
They like Janine

[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.440]
They show up late, they leave early

[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.480]
They're milling around in the hallway

[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.520]
Kind of like aimlessly

[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.960]
Here's a mobile in Miami

[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.300]
Hello

[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.600]
Hello, Neil

[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.120]
Yes sir

[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.680]
Good morning, how are you?

[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.120]
Great

[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:27.880]
Good

[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.540]
I answered your question

[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:30.660]
It was really simple

[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.680]
One in the Marlins

[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.980]
Nobody goes in the Marlins

[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.560]
I mean, it's first week of the season

[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.420]
And the first week of the season

[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:37.840]
And now an old buddy cares

[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.520]
I mean, they can't draw flies

[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.020]
If they were giving away $50 bills

[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.300]
They still couldn't get anybody in there

[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.700]
Right, the heat

[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.640]
And they're talking about a new stadium

[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.560]
By the way, they tried to use that opening day win

[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.520]
Remember that last week?

[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.940]
Oh yeah, a new stadium

[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:50.840]
Where we're going to put it now

[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.040]
Like it's a done deal already

[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.880]
You know, try to con a public into it

[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.600]
And you know, the dolphins

[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.000]
I mean, you got so many die-hard dolphins fans down here

[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.020]
You know, you literally have to go to the eight games

[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.440]
That they have once a year just to go and see the game

[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.020]
Because you've always blacked out

[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:08.920]
Yeah, that's true

[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.140]
I'm like all the other ones you're right

[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.340]
Yeah, and as far as the panther

[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.540]
The only thing I can think of me is I'm Jewish

[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:21.240]
And I go to see you and my other two or three other Jewish friends that go

[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.100]
And that's about it

[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.080]
I can't think of any other reason to go there than that

[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.280]
You go there to see Jews?

[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.540]
Excuse me?

[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.640]
You go there to see Jews?

[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.560]
Well, the only other Jews that are in there

[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.200]
All you guys do is drive around and sunrise

[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.240]
That's all you'll see is Jews

[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.880]
You don't have to go to the Macarena and sunrise

[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.620]
You just drive to go on sunrise lakes

[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.380]
Wow

[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.800]
That's the only Jews you want

[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.420]
I definitely don't go there

[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.500]
I live in sunrise lakes

[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.000]
There you go, there you go, huh?

[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.620]
Okay, you can't fail

[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:47.520]
Zagizant

[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.340]
Whatever that means

[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.440]
5670560, pound 560 on a mobile one line

[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.140]
Very, very meaningful topic here today in this show

[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.260]
Is there a big response?

[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:57.980]
No!

[00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:58.700]
They don't care

[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.340]
No matter what it is they don't care

[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.180]
But the draft they're whipped up about

[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.320]
That they're excited about

[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.180]
Because if football, football, man

[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.720]
Because they're morons, that's why

[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.780]
Because their low lives would no life

[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.760]
Here's sunrise, hello

[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.160]
I knew how are you

[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:13.640]
Okay, sir

[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.220]
At the risk of becoming a cornice

[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.780]
I feel compelled to call

[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:18.680]
Yes

[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.920]
I agree with you a thousand percent about the football draft

[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.220]
And about the attending the sporting event

[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.140]
I did go to the ballgame last Tuesday

[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.500]
I called you and told you I was going

[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.420]
Because I got the free ticket

[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.100]
The moral again?

[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:29.500]
Right

[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.220]
And they were up in the nose, greed section

[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.020]
Almost to the top

[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:32.460]
Yeah

[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.440]
Couldn't see anything on the field

[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.640]
But little sticks figures, you know

[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.680]
But we had a good time

[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.420]
And weather was nice

[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.780]
It was my anniversary

[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.040]
And we had a good time

[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.140]
You had a good time doing what

[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.060]
You couldn't see the game

[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.440]
Well, you know, just being there

[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.040]
Out in the open

[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:43.660]
In the air

[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.180]
Usually working inside all the time, you know

[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:46.420]
Yeah

[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.620]
But anyway, it was a game

[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.220]
I bet it was nice and comfortable out there yesterday

[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.520]
And then 94 degrees weather

[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.380]
That must have been beautiful

[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:52.600]
All right, I was working yesterday

[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.560]
Point is

[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.960]
That I am a met fan

[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.420]
And there are three games on

[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:57.440]
And out of the three games

[00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.400]
Only one of them is being televised

[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.660]
So I can't watch it on television

[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.100]
Of course I can listen to it on the radio

[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:03.480]
Yeah

[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.600]
The other thing I wanted to talk to you about was

[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.500]
I have a person very near and dear to me

[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.940]
Who had the same experience you did

[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.580]
Yesterday as a matter of fact

[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.440]
That's exactly right

[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:12.680]
Yeah

[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.540]
So it happens like he said it happened

[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.920]
Craig, like that bumper figure said

[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.600]
The crap happened

[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:16.960]
That's all

[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:17.780]
The last thing is

[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.440]
I know they've been talking about the Shawshank Redemption

[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.960]
I don't know if you were Steven King fans

[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.260]
No

[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.920]
He wrote the short story

[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.520]
Not even in the least bit

[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.220]
But the movie

[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.320]
I'd rather watch Larry King than Steven King

[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.100]
I'd rather be dead than watch Larry King

[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.840]
Well, it's not a horror story in any way

[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.600]
But it was up against forest gum

[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.940]
For the Academy Awards that year

[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:37.640]
For his dump

[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.480]
Yeah, which I know you love tremendously

[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.320]
And um...

[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.600]
Well, I got it now

[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.820]
I haven't gotten around watching you

[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:45.580]
Organ Freeman

[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.020]
In fact, maybe Saturday instead of going to Panther Camping him

[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.320]
I'll watch your Shawshank Redemption

[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.620]
That's a better alternative

[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.040]
Okay

[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.560]
But Morgan Freeman was nominated against Tom Hanks

[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.660]
And I felt he should have won the award

[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:56.940]
As did William Goldman

[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.720]
I know who he is

[00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.460]
No

[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.640]
Well, he wrote all the presidents, man

[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.680]
Why do you say you know I know who he is?

[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:04.820]
Well, I think you may have heard his name

[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:05.160]
You're an actor

[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.280]
You've never heard of William Goldman

[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:07.700]
In my life

[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.020]
Until this moment I've never heard that name uttered

[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:10.420]
Oh, well

[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.500]
I've heard of Irving Goldman, Saul Goldman, Irving Lipschitz

[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.560]
But never William Goldman

[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.120]
Well, you may run across his name now

[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.340]
And again, if you're reading about movies

[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.380]
I can do a lot

[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.200]
But anyway, just thought I'd bring a little bit of enlightenment to you

[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.040]
And that never spec'd

[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:23.740]
But it's a good movie

[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:24.380]
I think you'll enjoy it

[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.100]
See it at the ballpark

[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:26.300]
Okay, okay, okay

[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:26.580]
Not

[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.680]
5667-0560

[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.020]
We got 200 open lines here

[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.560]
5667-0560-050-560

[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.780]
On the mobile one line

[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.120]
Anybody else really been to the Air Canada Center?

[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.960]
At first caller from Boca, that phony baloney

[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.960]
He wouldn't know where to find it

[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.580]
If they stuck his ass right on the center right

[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:44.840]
Not exaggerating

[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.500]
Was very bitterly disappointing

[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.840]
I mean, just another place

[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.020]
They're all looking the same

[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.720]
And I mean, the hallways are interesting

[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.240]
Because they go out and all over all the memorabilia from April 8th

[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.940]
Gardens, that's great, a lot of history in nostalgia

[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:56.840]
In the hallway

[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.340]
But most of us don't spend the whole night in the hallway

[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.540]
Here's the mobile in Kendall

[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:02.480]
Hello

[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.260]
Hey Neil

[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:03.740]
Yes sir

[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:04.820]
How are you today

[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:05.060]
Okay

[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.380]
I was in St. Louis for a week

[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:09.940]
And man, let me tell you, I really missed you

[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.320]
I went up there

[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:15.740]
And I was sold impressed by the sports town that it is

[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:16.060]
Yeah

[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.080]
There were kids with McGuire's jerseys on

[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.680]
Fathers with McGuire's jerseys on

[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.160]
Advertising anywhere with McGuire

[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.180]
The town went bananas on home open at night

[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.280]
They had tech rallies

[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.180]
They really support the team up there

[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:32.500]
Incredible

[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.460]
The only thing is the town is a dump

[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.720]
It's depressing

[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:36.740]
Well, what would you rather have?

[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.820]
Would you rather live in a nice town or a place where they support the sports team?

[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.780]
Well, that was the point I was going to make

[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:42.760]
I come back to Miami

[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.300]
I couldn't wait to see the palm trees

[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.140]
I get here and I go

[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:45.960]
Well, wait a minute

[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.380]
This town ain't any better

[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.980]
The only difference is

[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.320]
Nobody supports the teams here

[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.620]
But what difference does that make me?

[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.300]
Did it ever dawn on anybody

[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.680]
What I've been saying for 20 years

[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.780]
This isn't the sports town

[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.560]
Did they ever cross anybody's mind?

[00:40:59.060 --> 00:40:59.720]
It's unbelievable

[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.460]
You go downtown and it's beautiful

[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.620]
They have a new dome stadium for the ramps

[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.380]
They have the things

[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.500]
Who don't want to see them?

[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.300]
Nobody wants to see them

[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.120]
But they have a new Kiel Arena for the hockey team

[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.660]
But how many new arenas do we have to build?

[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.320]
How many new stadiums do we have to build?

[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:16.880]
That's my point

[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.980]
They're peddling crap

[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.860]
They keep expanding and expanding

[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.820]
And the quality is diluted to the point

[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:26.540]
It's like taking a fine wine and mixing half of it with water

[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:27.540]
With the turpentine

[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.520]
I mean, what's the point?

[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.040]
I would be like putting a dome stadium in green bay

[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.020]
And telling people to have to go indoors to watch the green bay packers play

[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:36.340]
Right

[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.580]
I don't know why they would build the dome stadium in St. Louis

[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:40.860]
But they did it

[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.140]
And that's how they suckered them in

[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:43.260]
To get a new football team

[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.520]
And look what they got

[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.040]
Well, wait a minute

[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.020]
You're not telling me that they're not going to play baseball in the stadium?

[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.320]
They only play baseball in Bush stadium

[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.980]
And I don't know what to say

[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.820]
I understand but of all the places where you need a dome stadium

[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.080]
Have you ever been in St. Louis in the middle of the summertime?

[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.860]
Oh, it's like the end of the end of the world

[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:01.860]
It's like being in a jungle

[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.020]
It's like the end of the world

[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.540]
It's 100 times worse than it is here on our worst day

[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.240]
People drop dead to come here

[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.480]
So how come they're not playing the baseball in the dome stadium?

[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.500]
They make them with tents

[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.460]
You tell me

[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:12.820]
Yeah

[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.300]
Okay, thanks for the good news, sir

[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.420]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60

[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.560]
Take me out of the ball game

[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.160]
Let me go back to the house

[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.680]
That's what I say

[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.640]
Let me go home, let me out of here

[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.320]
Out of the zoo, out of the circus

[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:32.560]
People with their ball games, with their tickets, with all these things

[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.860]
That's, that's why they have to have all these accoutrements

[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.740]
That they have to jazz it up with all this other phony baloney crap

[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.920]
Because actually what's going on now there has been watered down to a point

[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:45.140]
Like I said, it would be like taking a surloin steak, grinding it up

[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.060]
And mixing it with seaweed

[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.680]
Mixing it with sawdust

[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.000]
And saying, hey isn't this the best damn thing you ever put in your purse, huh?

[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.400]
You have it a great time here?

[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.320]
Right, we're having a good time

[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:56.460]
I have it on the first lottery day

[00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:56.460]

[00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:57.800]
Right, we're having a good time

[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:05.320]
WC playing hands, I have it on the first lottery day

[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:14.040]
Oh, yeah

[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.000]
Five hits, and I'm weak

[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.100]
It billows me out for the piece I see

[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.720]
Like that ball, here I go again

[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:31.860]
I got the mud cheese, makes me want to smack

[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.700]
And then I'll lie down, going to take a nap

[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.720]
And then I'll get up and I'm making tracks

[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.760]
A couple of toasts and the buzz is coming back

[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.800]
Now I get it real whenever I roll that weed

[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:47.060]
Talk about my favorite sets of delicacies

[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:51.500]
Mix the extra cash and I'll sell you a little too

[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.040]
Yama

[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.580]
Who's the only roll I've bought this loaf to bet

[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:58.680]
Boy, I'm gonna hate to take that pure intent

[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.620]
My back forages weren't got only those

[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.860]
With the illegal grass grows

[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.860]
And this good stuff has to give me golf, eh?

[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:16.960]
Yama

[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.120]
11-0-0-2 at 560 WQ, we got a couple hours to go

[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.360]
And then we got the marlins and the bets

[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.400]
Yes, we do, the marlins and the bets

[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.160]
No, I'm telling you whether you want it or not

[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.600]
Hank will be on after the game, good luck to you Hank

[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.000]
He'll be on after the game, go 6th and 6th at your list day 2

[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.620]
And then we got, what do we got?

[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.700]
6 o'clock we got the Josh Friedman

[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.040]
Josh Friedman

[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.920]
And Jason, we're gonna be doing an hour and an hour and an hour

[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.200]
Cause they were cheap, a lot cheaper than the Schvokor Mourney

[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.720]
And 7 o'clock we got the Panthers at Ottawa pregame

[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.820]
Game time at 730, anybody gonna be listening to that?

[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:46.540]
No, nobody

[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:53.280]
Yeah, I'm thinking of myself here, I think I'm talking myself into coming into the real world

[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.160]
To getting some common sense, it's never too late, even in my advanced age

[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.700]
It's not too late to talk myself into getting some common sense

[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:05.240]
And I think starting next season, even with these free tickets, for example,

[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.220]
If we marlin tickets, they just sit in the drawer

[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:10.400]
I don't even give them a wipe, I'm not gonna kill the show with giveaways anymore

[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.940]
So they just sit in the drawer somewhere

[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:14.380]
Wasting away

[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:21.140]
And with the Panthers tickets next year, if it's like when the Leafs come into town

[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:24.980]
Or if it's a game that I feel is worth seeing, or if Pavel Burry comes back

[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:27.800]
And there's some excitement out there, and it's worth going over there to see it, then I'll go

[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:32.100]
But just to go over there, just because I see, I feel like I'm compelled to go

[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:35.120]
You know what I mean? I feel like I'm obligated to go

[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.860]
Why the hell should I be obligated to go?

[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.220]
Because it's there?

[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:46.180]
To sit there and be, see, I'll tell you one of the reasons I do go to those games is I don't eat

[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.940]
Trying desperately, I mean, desperately to lose the weight

[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:55.040]
Which is, my weight hasn't changed a half an ounce in the last three weeks

[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:59.120]
And I've been on tremendous behavior

[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:03.060]
So when I go to the doctor today, he better give me off that hydrochlorothylxide

[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.060]
And put me on something else so I can lose some weight

[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:09.940]
But I mean, when you go to the hockey game, so I drink my diet soda, one of them

[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:10.700]
And that's it

[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.140]
Oh and by the way, the guy that called Friday was right

[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.480]
What am I eating meatballs for? Everybody puts bread crumbs in meatballs

[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.780]
If you're on the edge, you can't eat meatballs

[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.820]
You putt, you schmuck, you idiot-neil, right?

[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.420]
But seriously, well, I'm not going to feel compelled to go anymore like I have to put in an appearance

[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:28.860]
For what?

[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:35.220]
So I can be bored to tears and wait for the score to be lopsided enough that I can justify jumping out of my seat saying

[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:38.000]
Let's get the hell out of here! That's the hell of a great evening

[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:42.440]
So I can sit there with people holding up their little kids in front of me

[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.060]
And waving to non-existent people across the way

[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.700]
Who never seemed to wave back by the way?

[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.580]
Yeah, they keep waving but nobody ever waves back

[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.780]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello

[00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:57.740]
Hello?

[00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:58.460]
Yes sir

[00:46:58.980 --> 00:46:59.920]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:00.340]
Okay

[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:05.500]
I just wanted to make a comment about the golfer named Maria

[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:12.680]
In Spain, they used Jose Maria, who was the parent of Jesus for boy

[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.620]
Jose Maria, wait a minute, Jose Maria was the parent of Jesus

[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.400]
Jose Maria?

[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.020]
Joseph, I'm Mary

[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.060]
Joseph, your little name was Maria?

[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:25.800]
No, the mother of Jesus was Mary, the father was Joseph

[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:26.200]
Yeah

[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.320]
And so they used Jose Maria for boy?

[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:29.680]
What about your little son?

[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:30.540]
No

[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.280]
And they used Maria Jose for girls

[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.380]
And either gay, they can just either wave

[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.080]
How about Mary Mary?

[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.520]
Well, yeah, that could be another choice

[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.580]
Maria Maria

[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:44.640]
One donation now, and the way they use it

[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.120]
Okay, which is gracias?

[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.940]
Okay, see Maria, I still know by that, Jose Maria

[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:51.640]
That's a girly name to me

[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.000]
That is, that's my mother

[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.260]
Hey, what do you call somebody named Jose Maria?

[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.920]
I guess it depends on what they're doing at the moment

[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.780]
5670560, how they're addressing

[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.780]
And pound 56 on the AT&T line

[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.980]
Here's the mobile and cutler rage, hello

[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.040]
Hey, Neil, do you call him Mary for short?

[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:08.720]
Yeah

[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.560]
This and something, you had a pretty crappy weekend, I...

[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.100]
No, we had it actually at a good time

[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.360]
Actually, at a great time

[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:17.040]
I mean, we're all pretty good, caught in a snow storm

[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.300]
And also go to see a crappy, you know, once I did hockey game

[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.860]
Quick story related to that about two weeks ago, I have a newborn

[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.760]
And I run out of formula, I get three o'clock in the morning

[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:29.480]
Had to run out to my local 24-hour store there

[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.540]
And pick up some, and I had some formula

[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:36.060]
I had a tackle bell feast about two or three hours earlier

[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:36.960]
You know what I mean?

[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.580]
And right about two blocks before the old house, you know

[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.680]
Nature in Cogni, you know that, those little cramps that just

[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.200]
Remove like you have your leg

[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.320]
It starts with a cramps

[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:52.400]
And then the M disappears in that word and it becomes something like cramps, yeah

[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.620]
It was either my brand new truck or the street

[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.800]
And gets what I opted for, three o'clock in the morning

[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.780]
Street, right in the middle of the street, baby

[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.900]
All right, take care, Neil

[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.720]
Okay, nice choice, good choice there, sir, who the hell's gonna...

[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.160]
Huh? Maybe the turlith police would come along at three in the morning

[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.320]
The third police

[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:12.560]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.380]
See this, they don't want to hear this, they think they want to hear just the opposite

[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.920]
I don't care, that's the way I feel about it

[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.960]
I'm not sure we had a bad time, I'm glad I had a chance to go there and see the place

[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.920]
And you know, the price was right on the ticket

[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.480]
Terrible seats, river, awful seats

[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:31.960]
But the actual experience itself, I mean everything that could have gone wrong

[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.920]
Paul Morris, who's been the least Pian answer for a hundred years

[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.360]
He was off his feet, he was calling the mispronouncing names

[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.180]
They sang both national anthems

[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.960]
And when they finished with the Canadian-O Canada, he says

[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:46.600]
Ladies and gentlemen, when you please rise, oh excuse me, he was reading the wrong card

[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.060]
He was like one event behind it

[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.160]
Everything that could have been out of sync, it was just depressing

[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.540]
For a place where for the last 600 years, they've known how to put on a hockey game

[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:57.380]
But not anymore

[00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:00.140]
Because it's got to be the Gary Benton way, baby

[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:05.600]
I can't take one more of those deals, you know

[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:06.960]
In fact, you know what's going to happen now?

[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.760]
Now that I've had that experience

[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.600]
Every time I hear that song, I think it's going to like my bowels will start twitching

[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.520]
And it gets to that part where it goes

[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.780]
Like that, I think I may just cut it loose

[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.300]
And you can assume what that song

[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:24.300]
Can't stand that song

[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:26.240]
And I can't stand the people that get off

[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:30.400]
I mean, how many times do they have to play it before you finally say

[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.640]
This is boring already, place something else

[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.940]
Play that corn ball stop and Tom Crap they play up there

[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:40.140]
And, and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and play something like that

[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:45.220]
Anything play like like the bird thing there I hate to bird play anything remember that

[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:52.140]
Just don't play then that then add it add it add it add it oh stop already

[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.140]
It's coming out of my ears it's coming out of my

[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.380]
Oh God

[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:00.200]
And the rolls you can enjoy it and not not up there. I mean up there that we did as a doormy

[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:04.280]
Like I said, it's one thing to be polite. It's another thing to be in a coma

[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:08.920]
Check the air Canada center to see if there's a pulse in that crowd

[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:16.320]
I've never in my life been at a sporting event before when the home team keep in mind I'm a leaf fan 100 years now

[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:22.260]
The home team scores all these goals every 10 to the score go I get up and scream and I'm my whole section

[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:25.200]
They're looking at me like what's wrong they're all sitting on their hands

[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:31.400]
I'm not exaggerating. I mean I'm looking down below and to plant them seeds in the gold and there's you know some people standing

[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.600]
They're all sitting on their hands

[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:41.900]
They're sitting on their visas and master cards waiting for somebody to pass the change down for something to feel the change

[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:45.780]
Depressing

[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:56.600]
Are you ready for Lahada on the edge toilet tissue to never hit your ass then you're ready for XTV

[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:05.280]
Extreme toilet paper this ain't your typical food lie it's heavy duty to handle the heaviest duty you can throw at it

[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:11.600]
You're talking super-tarts turbo-fly corrugated cardboard with an attitude we're talking the inner prize certainly your age is rising out the

[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:18.460]
Queen on we're talking over the top and up your butt can you handle it XTV it's not just tissue

[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:23.580]
It's an utterly gnarly ran to get away to take care of business that'll lead you gripping the edge of your toilet

[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:29.700]
See extreme toilet paper when you want to do more than just wipe you wipe out

[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:35.120]
It's love and 14 I did at 560 WQA and this whole business about you know why it's a great sports town

[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:40.420]
Yeah, so what about it the idea that because a lot of people go to see ball games that makes it some kind of a great city

[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:45.020]
Sorry, I don't buy that at all not that this is a great city because it's not but it's also not a sports town

[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.120]
X pew public uses coach of sexual misconduct

[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:49.400]
Oh

[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:55.940]
Now guess which so-called sport this is in it ties right into what we're talking about a couple weeks ago on those

[00:52:55.940 --> 00:53:02.560]
Fag occupations figure skating that's right figure skating and this is another one of these stories just like that

[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:08.780]
Sheldon Kennedy story with a hockey you know about how he had been molested for about a hundred years many finally decided he didn't like it

[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.360]
Even though I kept coming back to Graham James House every night

[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:17.660]
This is similar there was much better story in the Toronto paper yesterday which I should have cut out

[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:21.120]
I should have realized the paper or would have a very you know, but this is here and that's there

[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:28.560]
Richard Callahan who coach Terrell Appentke to an Olympic gold medal has been accused by one of his former figure skaters of sexual misconduct

[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:35.200]
The New York Times reported on Sunday. Well, that's why I read the story because I did by yesterday's times at the airport. That's right. That's why I read it

[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:40.220]
And I had the whole list of other names of guys who come forward now and said yeah, he's a whatever

[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:45.540]
Craig Marisi who skated for Callahan and later became a colleague

[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:49.080]
Well, what does that mean? A colleague

[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:55.740]
Told them just like you know Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Oh, here's my colleague Dr. Watson who lives with me

[00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:08.460]
Told the newspaper they've been having sex in 1981 and he now thinks he was exploited. Now, how do you like this? In 1981, the beginning of having sex with guys now 36 years old and now he thinks he was exploited

[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.980]
As he looks back on it

[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:16.740]
Callahan denied having a sexual relationship with Marisi the time said

[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:25.200]
Callahan contends the accusations are a ploy to rob them of a skater that they Detroit skating club where he'd been the director of competitive skating

[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:30.400]
Jim disbroke president of the west biggest skating association said Marisi informed him last month of the accusations

[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:39.000]
This bro said his organization cannot act until it receives a formal complaint Marisi planned to submit the complaint in a few weeks the newspaper said

[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:43.060]
Disbroke was in Sweden for a weekend competition attempts to reach him more unsuccessful

[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:51.220]
Marisi 36 said the relationships started after Callahan moved to Philadelphia to coach and in the New York Times story by the way it says it continued to like about a year ago

[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.520]
For 18 years he molested this guy

[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.380]
And he just decided he was exploited

[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:07.940]
Marisi who began working with him when he was 13 finished 5th nationally in pairs in 1989 he had appeared

[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:14.660]
And then we didn't hear this line this is the best this is the greatest line in the history of the human race

[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:22.860]
At the time I thought the sex was consensual Marisi told the times now when I look back I don't think it was consensual

[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:28.200]
I don't care how old a student is whether it's a boy or a girl a coach would never have sex with a student

[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.600]
At the time he thought it was consensual

[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:35.440]
But now he doesn't think it was

[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:44.920]
That's like that would be like a woman saying at the time I thought I wanted to have it but now I think I was raped

[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:47.900]
For the last 17 years

[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:49.300]
Happened

[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.240]
Yeah, oh it does happen

[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:55.120]
Same ridiculous crap is what it is

[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:02.980]
Marisi never reported any misconduct by Callahan before he said he's able to discuss the matter now because of the support of his wife and therapist

[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:04.360]
It has a life you know

[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:07.060]
Oh that in France so does the so does the coach by the way

[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:15.940]
The time said it spoke with Callahan and for four hours at his office in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan and interviewed four dozen skaters coaches official agents of parents

[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:18.960]
I don't understand this Callahan said the allegations are awful

[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:24.620]
I can't believe I worked my butt off for kids back home to be successful in skating to be better people and this stuff happens

[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.960]
Callahan with Marisi coach Lapinski 1998 Olympic gold medal

[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:33.800]
He also coached Todd Eldridge to five national titles in a world championship

[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:37.180]
He and Marisi split as coaching colleagues last year

[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.640]
Callahan 53 is marrying with a grown daughter

[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:40.840]
It has a life you know

[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:46.100]
He resigned as the director of the Detroit skating club in March telling the time he was tired of travel and coaching grind

[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:47.200]
He was tired of grinding it

[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:58.640]
18 years this stuff went on and this guy suddenly decided Craig Marisi he was being exploited and he was then abused

[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:07.240]
And don't forget he has a wife you know

[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:09.980]
Here's a mobile and four-letter deal. Hello

[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:12.240]
Obviously he must have liked it

[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.100]
Evidently

[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:14.340]
Hey Neil

[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:17.260]
At least for 17 or 18 years then he maybe got tired of it

[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:20.200]
Yeah like the caller a couple maybe got sore about it

[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.800]
The caller last thing there was with the Jose and the Maria

[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:24.320]
Yeah

[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:27.840]
Didn't that guy just win the master's yesterday

[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:30.060]
That's what I was talking about yes

[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:31.420]
Maria Jose

[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:34.960]
Hey name is Maria Jose Sally Schwartz Lapute

[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:35.820]
Alley Balls

[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:36.040]
Right

[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:37.460]
Hey

[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.000]
Resident goes through hell all week

[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.180]
Aren't you just go ahead and slap them tickets my way for Saturday?

[00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.040]
Yes, slap this, okay

[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:45.860]
Slap this

[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:47.340]
See there you go

[00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:49.360]
Why don't you just go ahead and slap him my way

[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:49.960]
Slap

[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:50.800]
Trap

[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.440]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60

[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.420]
On the AT&T wireless line

[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.720]
See they don't want to talk about using the

[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.900]
Well if we got free tickets like you did Neil

[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:02.060]
See that's not the point

[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:04.580]
The point is whether you're free or you're paying for them

[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:05.900]
What's the big deal of going?

[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.840]
What is the attraction when you can sit on like all the Panther games this year have been televised

[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:14.400]
And I can think of so many nights that I wasted my time and effort

[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:17.320]
Shlip it over there when I could have sat home and a game turned out to be a disaster

[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:20.300]
And then like very early on turn out something more enjoyable

[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:21.400]
Like a real game maybe

[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:24.700]
Here's a mobile in Hylia

[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:24.960]
Hello

[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.080]
There's no facts in figure skating

[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.000]
Not at all

[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.880]
On the Jose Maria thing

[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:33.960]
He is not married and still lives at home with his parents

[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:35.220]
Who home Maria?

[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:37.600]
Yes, if that means anything so to speak

[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:38.520]
How old is he 48?

[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.460]
33 years old still living in home with his parents

[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:42.900]
He's still at home with mommy and daddy like Barry Jackass?

[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:45.500]
Yes and very private they said on the telecast

[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.800]
He's a very private life

[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:47.700]
Oh boy

[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:48.740]
How about that now?

[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:54.940]
Oh but you mean to say that a possible a possible a suspected one of those may have won the Masters yesterday?

[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:55.760]
Oh!

[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:57.960]
Oh my god what's it coming to?

[00:58:58.540 --> 00:58:59.560]
And one more thing

[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.600]
What do you expect to be an expert on balls huh?

[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:02.500]
That's true

[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:07.700]
Any one mentioned Hank interview with Alonzo Morning on Friday?

[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:08.240]
No

[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:11.560]
In true Larry King's form

[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:15.140]
He threw so many bouquets Alonzo is opening up a flower shop today

[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.580]
Did he did a marshmallow toss again?

[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:22.740]
Oh my god not one tough question even when it came around to the lockout type of thing

[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.060]
Yeah

[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.600]
Nothing he was kissing his butt the whole year

[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:25.740]
He took that

[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:30.440]
He had finally had a chance one of the key guys in that lockout thing was Alonzo Morning

[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:33.620]
And he just let him let him off those didn't ask him one tough question

[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:33.960]
Nice

[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.160]
And Hank great job

[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:36.620]
Okay

[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:37.340]
See you

[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.440]
How's it going Clark doing?

[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:44.580]
567 we got 600 open lines here it's another grim Monday boys and girls have a short show you better hurry but it get with it

[00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:50.430]
We're only here to 105 and then we got the marlins in the midst 5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:53.110]
Pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:57.270]
Then my good friend Ellie Brecker wrote this ridiculous story about this Orthodox Jew

[00:59:58.530 --> 01:00:00.410]
This rabbi Shmouli Boteach

[01:00:01.450 --> 01:00:03.070]
I do like that name though Shmouli

[01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:04.310]
Never made a guy name Shmouli

[01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:05.470]
That's a great name

[01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:08.410]
He says sex and marriage should be joyful

[01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:12.950]
But as you read into this very long story which I have no idea they must have a lot of empty space in the paper

[01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:15.370]
Or Ellie needed a few bucks to write a stupid story

[01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:24.330]
He says that married couples though should have observed Talmudic law couples must abstain from sex for half of every month

[01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:24.990]
He says

[01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:27.750]
How do you like that you like it?

[01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:28.310]
No

[01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:29.190]
Ridiculous

[01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:34.270]
And he also says oral sex and toys are okay sex toys they're kosher

[01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:36.170]
How can you have kosher oral sex?

[01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:38.990]
I mean how can you eat pork and it can be kosher right?

[01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:40.790]
Every here a kosher pork?

[01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:41.190]
No

[01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:48.190]
But pornography and masturbation are not okay not so good bad evil evil

[01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:51.090]
But sex toys that's okay

[01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:57.190]
What about mutual masturbation?

[01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:00.410]
No no no no no no no no

[01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:01.450]
What about mutual sex toys?

[01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:02.370]
Correct them

[01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:02.650]
Huh?

[01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:07.510]
Yeah the Orthodox Jews they must be having a lot of sex a hell of a lot more than just half a month

[01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:13.070]
Either that or they're doing a lot during that half a month because the real support the more Orthodox they are the more they reproduce like rabbits

[01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:17.590]
Like 10th world people the pope would be proud

[01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:19.810]
Here's Miami hello

[01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:20.390]
Uh Neil

[01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.930]
Yes sir

[01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:26.030]
Okay just getting back to Georgia on Friday it's about two late coming back to what?

[01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:26.310]

[01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:29.210]
Two Georgia show on Friday from 132

[01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:33.630]
Tell them to save this money on emailize this don't wait it's not too late

[01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:36.190]
No it's not too late I have to take it back

[01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:37.750]
Yeah the worst worst

[01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:46.130]
Anyhow Neil I got a spy report of all you all I know who's like a rocket scientist took his establish a Florida driving test

[01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:48.250]
And if I know you'll

[01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:49.890]
He failed it baby

[01:01:49.890 --> 01:01:56.990]
He told him but the book says and they said that's right but the book is absolutely incorrect sir

[01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.990]
Oh right

[01:01:58.570 --> 01:02:04.130]
So a guy who couldn't fail a trigonometry test if you have paid them

[01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:06.450]
Fail to the driver's license test

[01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:07.990]
Okay thanks to the good news

[01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:13.350]
Boy that guy I don't know he that's one of those crimes but he's got a real annoying voice almost like that Joe that caused the sports cars all the time

[01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:14.830]
Oh that guy grabbed me nuts

[01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:20.070]
I know Diffo was doing it so all this morning in the show too so he didn't have much choice but that Joe

[01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:26.830]
I'm telling you Diffo you want to get those numbers up on a worst team show get rid of that Joe guy I'm telling you take a pull on Joe

[01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:32.390]
The audience is in revolt with Joe they can't stand Joe Joe mama get him off the air

[01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:39.010]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line here's Kendall hello

[01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:46.830]
Either the viewership of the Panthers games is less than I thought it was or I missed someone's call to you this morning

[01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:52.010]
But are you aware of the introduction given by Denise on Saturday?

[01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.550]
No

[01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:52.610]
No

[01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:53.410]
You're not

[01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:57.110]
Do you remember his description of how he felt one night?

[01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:58.030]
Yeah

[01:02:58.030 --> 01:02:58.970]
That you have on card

[01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:59.410]
Right

[01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:03.510]
Well in the first 60 to 70 seconds and his prepared remarks

[01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:05.230]
I feel really really stupid

[01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.730]
Yeah

[01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:10.330]
Well check out if you'd like to take I will bring it to you tomorrow it's beyond belief

[01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:11.750]
His prepared remarks

[01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:12.150]
Yes

[01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:18.530]
He described the Toronto Maple Leaf style of play with the Panthers playing underneath the handicap of all the injuries

[01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:23.270]
He just picked their style they as that's right as one

[01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:24.710]
Yes just what you played

[01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:26.990]
He said that

[01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:31.670]
Exactly in his prepared remarks if you'd like to take I could drop it off there tomorrow

[01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:33.330]
He said that again

[01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:34.530]
I promise you

[01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:35.410]
He said it again

[01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:36.490]
I listen to it

[01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:38.630]
That dumb frog said it again I would give

[01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:40.990]
I'm just amazed that you don't know about this

[01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:41.390]
No

[01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:43.370]
Well I know but I want you to do it three times

[01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:45.330]
I'm begging you for that tape

[01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:46.210]
Oh I will have it tomorrow

[01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:47.030]
God bless you

[01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:48.590]
You'll have it tomorrow let me ask you one other thing

[01:03:48.590 --> 01:03:48.750]
Yeah

[01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:49.630]
Because I was out of town

[01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:50.610]
He said it again

[01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:53.090]
But this is in prepared remarks

[01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:54.230]
Oh

[01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:55.290]
This is not ad lib

[01:03:55.910 --> 01:04:00.590]
But I don't even understand what the point is in other words he expected Toronto to just roll down in the roll

[01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:05.290]
I don't know what the point of the remark was I don't know why he would call their style of play that

[01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:08.750]
And I don't know how that relates to the Panthers injuries I didn't understand that

[01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:12.210]
But I am 100,000% sure of what he said

[01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:14.110]
I feel really really stupid

[01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:14.730]
Exactly

[01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:18.190]
Tell me about the lovely lady

[01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:19.910]
She's gone

[01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:20.970]
Lovely lady

[01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:21.310]
Yeah

[01:04:21.310 --> 01:04:22.690]
What lovely lady

[01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:24.610]
Lovely lady on 79

[01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:25.850]
Lovely lady

[01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:28.550]
What are you talking about?

[01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:30.250]
What lovely lady

[01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:31.230]
Oh God

[01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:33.110]
Lovely lady on 79

[01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:34.290]
Watch to your face

[01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:36.630]
Oh Sandy I love you go from my guy you go from

[01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:37.930]
That's the very important

[01:04:37.930 --> 01:04:40.630]
They're both equally boring you read about that

[01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:41.350]
She's gone

[01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:43.470]
Yes, but gone for one time

[01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:45.310]
Well thanks for the good news

[01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:46.090]
I thought you'd like it

[01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:48.510]
Okay, okay he's bringing the tape tomorrow. Thank you sir

[01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:51.210]
Oh my God if Denise Pantman said that again

[01:04:52.310 --> 01:04:56.270]
I mean it's one thing to be a dumb frog but sooner or later don't you learn from your mistakes

[01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.630]
No

[01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:58.470]
Don't you learn you can't say crap on a year

[01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:04.950]
And I'm sure that we're still bringing him on the year on Thursdays at 4 in the afternoon

[01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:07.150]
I don't want to be labor that point

[01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:09.170]
A lot of books are needed

[01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:19.630]
Oh, darling, I'm begging you

[01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:21.410]
The thought is too stagnant

[01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:23.190]
Donnie is through the moon

[01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:24.970]
What's so bad with you?

[01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:27.110]
Donnie is through you

[01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:29.150]
What's so bad with you?

[01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:33.410]
Denise Pantman

[01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:34.130]
Denise Pantman

[01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:35.330]
Denise Pantman

[01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:38.150]
Denise Pantman

[01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.910]
Denise Pantman

[01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:41.990]
Denise Pantman

[01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:44.590]
I'm so fed up with you

[01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:51.830]
Oh, what a jerk you're so great you're a worse than a wise one

[01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:53.390]
And I like you

[01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:57.830]
You're so happy from your act to a fuck

[01:05:57.830 --> 01:06:01.550]
I'm even crying Murray won't get here anymore if I do

[01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:07.210]
Oh, darling, I value

[01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:11.310]
A purchase to statue, Taiwanese through you

[01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:12.970]
What's so bad with you?

[01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:14.850]
Donnie, I value

[01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:19.090]
What's not just to statue, Taiwanese through you

[01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:20.610]
What's so bad with you?

[01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:22.410]
Donnie, I value

[01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:24.050]
What's not just to statue

[01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:26.430]
He's a genius, he's a real raving idiot

[01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:30.830]
1131 at 560 WQM just an hour and 35 minutes away from Marlon's baseball

[01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:33.450]
Marlon's animates from Shastate him in New York

[01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:34.870]
Any interest don't even say it

[01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:39.150]
56070560.560 on our AT&T wireless line

[01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:43.510]
Why do we go to games that are on television for free?

[01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:45.130]
That's a reasonable question

[01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:51.890]
Why would you make the effort to spend the gas money?

[01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:57.030]
Especially people that actually have to pay for the tickets and for parking

[01:06:57.030 --> 01:06:58.430]
And then people are belly again

[01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:00.090]
Oh, geez, they're not supporting their team

[01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:02.830]
Well, what they do isn't that a shame

[01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:04.130]
Let's put them in the electric chair

[01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:05.770]
They didn't support their team

[01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:08.030]
Now see the guy before that call the NFL

[01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:09.530]
See, they were the smart ones

[01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:12.090]
With the blackouts, they knew how to blackmail the fans

[01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:14.830]
If you're not going to fill up the stadium, we won't have it on free TV

[01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:15.670]
And you won't see it

[01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:18.430]
Here's Miami, hello

[01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:19.190]
I knew

[01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:23.230]
Last Wednesday, about 1230, I called you from Havana

[01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:27.070]
Because I was with a small group of people

[01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:28.310]
who listened to you every day

[01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:30.430]
And I said, well, why don't we call them?

[01:07:30.530 --> 01:07:31.450]
We were in the house, you know

[01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:33.470]
But the station did not accept the call

[01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:35.890]
They said the data and accept the call

[01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:38.130]
The call had to be made through an operator

[01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:38.930]
Right

[01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:41.790]
And I thought you were expecting DC passage of several households

[01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:43.890]
Well, it would have been very interesting

[01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:46.370]
Because these people have, you know, they are fans of you

[01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:52.070]
As I told you before, the only station that gets into Cuba very clear

[01:07:52.070 --> 01:07:54.790]
is 560

[01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:55.050]
Right

[01:07:55.050 --> 01:07:57.610]
Because it's not a political station

[01:07:57.610 --> 01:08:01.290]
But what they told me to give you a message is that they love to see you there

[01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:05.490]
Maybe even do a program right from Havana

[01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:06.290]
No

[01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:11.010]
No, no, no, no

[01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:12.370]
No, no, no

[01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:14.650]
You don't want to make people crazy

[01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:15.850]
No

[01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:16.310]
No

[01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:18.670]
Okay, anyway, you are invited

[01:08:18.670 --> 01:08:20.050]
I'm not in the guys with beer, anyway

[01:08:20.650 --> 01:08:22.530]
Not to do the program, but to visit

[01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:23.150]
No

[01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:24.410]
No, either

[01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:25.010]
No

[01:08:25.650 --> 01:08:27.370]
The Orioles went, what did they do?

[01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:27.370]

[01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:29.230]
Okay, put it out into the Orioles

[01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:32.630]
But next time that I go, I'm going to try to arrange it with George

[01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:36.770]
I'm going to try to arrange it with George so you can accept the call

[01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:39.950]
Okay, I think we call this collector from Havana, what's that goes called?

[01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:41.690]
He's that Rabbi, Catholic?

[01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:44.730]
He's Catholic, he's reproducing to make the Pope happy, right?

[01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:46.090]
Okay, Neil, nice to meet you.

[01:08:46.090 --> 01:08:47.550]
I'm reproducing like Rabbi, it's okay, I'll read it, Ertchi

[01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:48.210]
Thank you, Neil

[01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:49.010]
And Gratius

[01:08:50.690 --> 01:08:53.790]
567, special hello to all our friends in Havana, by the way, I'll ten of them down there

[01:08:53.790 --> 01:08:56.690]
who are gathered around our radio listening for the truth as Fidel is the AL Antichristo

[01:08:57.430 --> 01:09:00.770]
and the Tupacabra all rolled up into one and hasn't bathed in ten years

[01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:02.450]
But other than that, he's okay

[01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:05.550]
567, that's our poll question, who's worse?

[01:09:05.690 --> 01:09:07.190]
Iliana Gross-Latinan or Fidel?

[01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:08.050]
That's a tough one

[01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:09.330]
That's like Nippentuck

[01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:14.990]
567, 0560, 0560, on the AT&T wireless line

[01:09:15.830 --> 01:09:17.270]
Here's Pompano, hello

[01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:17.950]
Neil

[01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:18.550]
Yes sir

[01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:19.470]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:19.910]
Okay

[01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:24.270]
I got it, man, I do go down to the Panther Games, I'm a level of penguins are in town

[01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:27.470]
but I do pay for my own tickets, but that's the only time

[01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.710]
Yeah

[01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:30.630]
Still 100 Spy Reports for you

[01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:35.950]
I was listening a couple weeks ago, I tried calling you a couple weeks ago with your phone system hung up on me

[01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:40.510]
He had a guest on the other day with all the Y2K craft going on

[01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:44.530]
The guy had an appliance shop from Pondontan LA

[01:09:44.530 --> 01:09:48.250]
and he had offered a, if you brought in your toaster and your blender

[01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:54.470]
he'd do a real cheap microchip change-up to help you comply with the Y2K

[01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.950]
Yeah

[01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:58.990]
And it was hilarious, I guess you have to listen to him, I mean

[01:09:58.990 --> 01:09:59.750]
Are you sure?

[01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:03.870]
Can I have a shameless request, Neil?

[01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:04.390]
Maybe

[01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:07.870]
I've been trying to call you for so many weeks, I never get through and the...

[01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:10.750]
Anything still 100, maybe even the...

[01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:12.270]
What's the one that?

[01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:14.170]
The Jews against the Niggers in a hockey

[01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:17.030]
The Jews against the Niggers, okay, never write that

[01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:18.230]
The Jews against the Niggers

[01:10:19.690 --> 01:10:22.870]
Okay, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, 9

[01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:27.630]
The Jews against the Niggers, there you go, are you gonna play that?

[01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:28.270]
No

[01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:29.910]
No, at least he said Jews

[01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:34.010]
Yeah, the Kites against the Spicks against the Waps against the Niggers

[01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:37.990]
5, 6, 7, we got 400 open lines here today and hour and 30 minutes to kill

[01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:39.830]
But let's put the ball game on early, what do you say?

[01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:45.330]
Come back and tell you my experience and these people that cats got their tongue again today

[01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:47.750]
They got nothing to say about, they like going in and shoosin' around

[01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:50.790]
They don't give a crap about what else is going on there, they're having a good time

[01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:53.770]
They like sitting there and seeing the big push up on the screen

[01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:57.370]
and acting like a bunch of jackasses and getting drunk, they maybe have it a good time

[01:10:57.870 --> 01:11:02.250]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line

[01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:04.350]
Here's Miami, hello

[01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:05.150]
Hello?

[01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.730]
Yes sir

[01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:06.510]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:09.530]
Okay, we come back from Las Vegas, Italy

[01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:13.730]
and it was real nice last week

[01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:16.910]
Yeah, probably not so bad the week before either

[01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:17.050]
Huh?

[01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:20.090]
No, I mean, we say at C-Sers

[01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:20.530]
Right

[01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:23.570]
Well, you know, we find a deal about the best of all of this

[01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:27.730]
We went over to see the New Wanda in Mandalay Bay

[01:11:27.730 --> 01:11:28.410]
Right

[01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:32.330]
It's brand new, you know, and it's pretty young all that

[01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:35.570]
but somehow he got no...

[01:11:36.190 --> 01:11:37.210]
No personality

[01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:40.370]
Like Bellagio, I was very unimpressed, it's gigantic

[01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:41.930]
and they got all that art in there somewhere

[01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:46.110]
but just another big sterile place, it did nothing for me Bellagio

[01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:49.710]
The New Wanda, I've been going to open it in a few days

[01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:53.010]
The Paris and the Nation

[01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:56.210]
No, Paris isn't going to open in a few days, isn't it November?

[01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:58.290]
November, well, one of them is going to open it

[01:11:58.290 --> 01:12:00.150]
The Nation's opening in a few days

[01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:01.850]
Yeah, it looks beautiful

[01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:02.930]
Well, they outside, you know

[01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:06.030]
Well, it just keeps getting better there, you know, if you don't like one place, you go to another

[01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:10.550]
A lot of five people though, a lot of five people all over the place

[01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:11.430]
A lot of fat people?

[01:12:11.530 --> 01:12:11.770]
Yeah

[01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:13.630]
We're in trouble

[01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:16.570]
Okay, whatever you say, pal, I'm glad you had a good time

[01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:18.410]
A lot of fat people in Vegas, okay?

[01:12:19.150 --> 01:12:20.010]
Do you ever know this thing?

[01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:21.170]
No

[01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.550]
I notice a lot more fat people here than I see in Vegas

[01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:27.970]
In fact, you can go speaking to the Macarena, you want to see fat people go to Pat their hockey game

[01:12:27.970 --> 01:12:29.830]
You'll see more fat people in your section

[01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:33.650]
No matter what section you're sitting in, just in the one section, then you'll probably see in all of Vegas

[01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:37.430]
I don't see fat people, I see like any, and he's probably hanging on the wrong places

[01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:39.930]
Probably out with all those fat Mexicans

[01:12:41.210 --> 01:12:45.710]
Well, Mexicans are fat, they're either one or two things, they're very skinny because they're undernourished

[01:12:45.710 --> 01:12:50.250]
Or they're very, very fat because they're, again, nourished poorly, bad food, you know, bad diet

[01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:51.350]
They're eating all that to starch

[01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:56.750]
Other than Luis Miguel, have we ever seen a really well-built...

[01:12:56.750 --> 01:13:00.690]
Oh, and by the way, speaking, now who is this that he's supposed to be hanging out with now Mariah Carey?

[01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:01.050]
Mariah Carey

[01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:02.430]
Is there anybody that she's not doing?

[01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.770]
Me

[01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:08.150]
Seriously, and why? You think that she's, you would do Mariah Carey?

[01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:09.770]
Yes, and you think pictures are her lately?

[01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:10.730]
Not lately

[01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:15.250]
Oh, one of the tabloids that I read on the plane had a picture of her in Luis on the beach during a Capucco

[01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:19.870]
Oh, my God, I thought Jesus Christ, Luis must have found a beach trail out there

[01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:24.830]
She just hoarded up, she's gross, she's really gross

[01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:26.850]
I'll take another look

[01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:29.250]
I'd rather do Andy Carey before Mariah Carey

[01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:34.250]
5,670560, I'd rather do Hugh Carey

[01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:39.110]
Is he dead, by the way? Dead or alive, Hugh Carey, remember him?

[01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:43.130]
From New York, wasn't he the governor, the mayor, who was something in New York?

[01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:48.070]
5,670560, 05,560, I'd rather do the AT&T, where I was flying

[01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:50.270]
Don't go to Vegas, you'll find too many fat people there

[01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:51.670]
All that guy says

[01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:54.950]
What? And if there are?

[01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:01.770]
Did like, there's a punchline, one of your people don't ask me

[01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:05.890]
I don't speak his language, whatever language he was speaking, I don't speak it, okay?

[01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:07.030]
It was one of your people

[01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.450]
And quit picking on Kiano Reeves, okay?

[01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:13.790]
Just because he looks like a dead end Rukunan and Sam the Shamar Promotion Man

[01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:15.710]
What? Like a Mongoloid, like Sam

[01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:17.930]
Want a Lonely Top Little Boy?

[01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:21.210]
It's the musical show everyone's talking about

[01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:26.250]
In their only area performance, the Spice Girls tribute band, This Spooge Girl

[01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:28.470]
Is he one of you massacred like this?

[01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:29.910]
He got a gift for his boots

[01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:33.370]
They're here, they're hot, and say love

[01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:34.630]
Spooge

[01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:39.630]
This is the Spice Girls, this is the Spice Girls, this is the Spice Girls, this is the Spice Girls

[01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:42.210]
Hello, where's the Spice Girls?

[01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:45.230]
All songs represent Spice, love is everywhere

[01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:47.770]
We believe in Spice, how are they?

[01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:54.970]
I believe in you, where they think that's the Spice Girls, this is the Spice Girls

[01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:58.450]
This Spice Girls, in their only area performance

[01:14:58.450 --> 01:15:02.410]
If you don't see this show, then you don't know Spice

[01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:04.370]
16 to noon, our poll question

[01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:07.690]
How many years do you have to have sex with somebody before you decide that you were being exploited?

[01:15:09.170 --> 01:15:09.250]
Huh?

[01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:13.650]
200 years? How about 500 years? How about 157 years?

[01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:17.450]
Marisi says at the time I thought the sex was consensual

[01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:20.370]
This was for 17 years this went on

[01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:25.370]
Now, when I look back, he says, when I look back, I don't think it was consensual

[01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:30.770]
I don't care how old a student is, whether it's a boy or a girl a coach had never had sex with a student he says

[01:15:31.530 --> 01:15:35.030]
Just like Shelley Kennedy, or whatever her name was

[01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:39.490]
You know about Shelley Kennedy, the hockey player with Graham James, or Shelley Kennedy?

[01:15:39.650 --> 01:15:40.810]
He has a wife, you know?

[01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:42.850]
Oh yeah, and the O'Ferry?

[01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:44.230]
He has a wife, you know?

[01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:48.010]
Oh, he was just in the back seat, he was sleeping, I'll show it

[01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.970]
He didn't know nothing

[01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:54.790]
I mean, these are the most bizarre, and they put these in the newspaper like with a straight push

[01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:57.490]
You know, like, yeah, this makes sense, does the mechanism sense to me?

[01:15:57.670 --> 01:15:57.770]
No

[01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:58.130]
No

[01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:00.730]
Here's Cutler Ridge, hello

[01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:02.790]
Hello, doctor?

[01:16:03.010 --> 01:16:03.230]
Yes

[01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:04.410]
How are you doing, Neil?

[01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.670]
Great

[01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:07.530]
Listen, I want to lodge a complaint about

[01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:10.750]
Broadcasting, Marlant's, baseball

[01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:17.710]
If I'm not going to go to the stadium and forbid myself to watch them, why would I want to listen to it?

[01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:21.590]
That's the idea, we want to give it the opportunity, you don't have to go especially since it's in New York anyway

[01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:22.870]
You can't afford to go there right now

[01:16:23.410 --> 01:16:25.090]
You can listen for free

[01:16:25.090 --> 01:16:28.470]
That's a joke, man, I want to talk to your program director, I want to kick his ass

[01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:30.830]
Alright, come on down, that will take about 30 seconds

[01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:32.610]
By the way, nice desk in there, bluff

[01:16:33.150 --> 01:16:35.990]
Is this as the, uh, a, a, a desk coming yet?

[01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:36.310]
No

[01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:37.290]
For pussy galore?

[01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:37.610]
No

[01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:37.930]
No

[01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:43.190]
Well, maybe James Bond stole it

[01:16:43.690 --> 01:16:45.970]
Seriously, it had his name on it, pussy galore

[01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:52.270]
I walked by through this morning, I purposely looked in there to see if he was still sitting in there with a little tiny table

[01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:54.210]
With a pewter on it and all that other stuff

[01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:55.270]
I mean, no

[01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:56.290]
Not there

[01:16:56.290 --> 01:16:57.510]
No desk

[01:16:57.510 --> 01:17:02.050]
It's only the 12th of April, this can be another one of our contests for the QAM audience

[01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.710]
Take up an office pool

[01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:09.450]
What date, what month, what year, what century, which lifetime, even Shirley McLean is laughing about this

[01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:12.530]
Which lifetime does Duff get to desk from Greg Reed?

[01:17:13.290 --> 01:17:14.670]
We can't afford no desk

[01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:17.430]
We got to keep paying Wayne and John Henry

[01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:20.070]
And boy, if you think nobody wanted those Marlant's bots before

[01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:22.270]
Hooh, way, no way

[01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:25.270]
Gonna be unbelievable is here

[01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:27.050]
They can't draw flies

[01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:30.190]
You know something, what I did in my pants in the Toronto with the Eaton Center

[01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:34.050]
You could do that, like the guy that went out there in his truck three in the morning on the middle of the street

[01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:36.490]
Nature was calling, you can drop the load in the middle of the street

[01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:38.450]
You could do that right in that second base

[01:17:39.630 --> 01:17:44.810]
They could have the whole organization just do a big, they could take a dump truck out there and try to take a dump

[01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:47.310]
And they still couldn't draw flies

[01:17:48.570 --> 01:17:49.070]
To it

[01:17:50.050 --> 01:17:51.050]
Because nobody cares

[01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:52.750]
Oh, but let's build a new stadium

[01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:54.710]
You see how ridiculous this is?

[01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:56.350]
You see how in Congress it is?

[01:17:56.530 --> 01:17:57.570]
How alludeic, recit is?

[01:17:57.730 --> 01:18:01.350]
Nobody cares, but let's build a new stadium because then maybe somebody will care

[01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:02.150]
Will they care?

[01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.450]
No

[01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:03.350]
Will more people come?

[01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:03.790]
No

[01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:06.950]
In fact, fewer people will come because who the hell wants to go to downtown Miami?

[01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:11.150]
They just don't want to get the message

[01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:19.050]
The only people who care about Marlant's baseball and this listing audience are the ones who resent the fact that they keep preempting parts of the game

[01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:21.390]
And they show for stupid ball games that nobody cares about

[01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:23.470]
Those are the only ones that we ever hear from

[01:18:25.810 --> 01:18:29.270]
560-560-560 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:30.870]
Here's Coral Springs, hello

[01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:32.990]
You carry is alive and well

[01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:35.690]
Mariah Carey yes

[01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:39.510]
And the Harold did a faux-pai yesterday that was unbelievable

[01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.990]
Yeah

[01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:44.070]
They created a special section for Disney Resorts

[01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:47.330]
And you know, I didn't really pay attention

[01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:49.190]
I was like, I'm not going to go there, I thought that on the floor

[01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:51.390]
And I went into the main section on page three

[01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:55.310]
They had to reprint the entire front page of the Disney Resort cover

[01:18:55.810 --> 01:18:58.030]
Because the one that went out was only a proof

[01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:59.690]
Full of errors

[01:18:59.690 --> 01:19:04.110]
And they had to reprint the entire cover in color on page three the main section

[01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:05.390]
Great excellent

[01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:06.670]
Announcing that it was a problem

[01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:08.750]
I hope that they have a lot of sleepless nights over too

[01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:12.270]
I'm sure we did need it maybe one of the last times we'll get some advertising

[01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:13.790]
Excellent thanks for the good news

[01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:14.050]
Bye-bye

[01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:19.230]
Anything that bad that happens to the Harold can only be good and active God

[01:19:20.910 --> 01:19:24.290]
560-560-560 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:26.970]
We continue the search here pressing, pushing and plotting

[01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:28.550]
They won't tell us why they go

[01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:31.590]
They won't tell us when they can watch that swill on TV for free

[01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:32.790]
Why they keep showing up?

[01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:35.470]
Why they keep driving from Palm Beach from Dade County

[01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:37.590]
From from Yannem's Vell from Monroe County

[01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:38.730]
From over there on a West Coast

[01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:40.050]
What are they doing it for?

[01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:41.330]
Why did they show up?

[01:19:42.190 --> 01:19:45.650]
When they can see it for free better in a more comfortable environment

[01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:48.850]
Without all that effort

[01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:53.510]
When they can like turn it off anytime they want they can avoid all the dead spots

[01:19:54.930 --> 01:19:56.250]
I don't get it

[01:19:57.530 --> 01:19:59.550]
Here's a mobile in Wellington hello

[01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:00.330]
Neil

[01:20:00.330 --> 01:20:01.070]
Yes sir

[01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:04.530]
I'm going to try some Palm Beach to go see the games

[01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:05.370]
Yeah

[01:20:05.370 --> 01:20:07.530]
Come down to you once more I don't know man

[01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:10.010]
Next year I'm going to really seriously want to think about this

[01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:16.790]
When you get your wood a game you feel like you've been entertained in other words enough to make it worth your wilder of driven down

[01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:19.250]
No I feel like it's been over that's what I feel like

[01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:19.590]
Right

[01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:20.150]
Absolutely

[01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:21.010]
Yeah

[01:20:21.010 --> 01:20:22.410]
Even on TV I feel like I'm going to be a little bit more careful

[01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:23.790]
So what are all those people doing there?

[01:20:23.890 --> 01:20:27.270]
Why can't why will they not tell me what it is that they keep coming back for?

[01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:30.210]
I'm begging I'm pleading they will not tell me

[01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:31.890]
Free T-shirts dude that's what it is

[01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:35.470]
They're not but how many people get free T-shirts about ten of them during the whole game

[01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:37.410]
And all those little pucky kids get the T-shirts

[01:20:37.410 --> 01:20:41.570]
You're right hey I heard there's 1100 people at a White Sox game where we can do that

[01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:42.530]
You're 1100?

[01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:44.570]
I couldn't believe it somebody told me I could

[01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:48.250]
Sure if that's true I'll have I will have a sexual accident in my pants

[01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:53.950]
I kind of think maybe Popman was saying that Toronto had a Chippy team

[01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:54.610]
Well Chippy

[01:20:54.610 --> 01:20:57.550]
I don't know if they're really Chippy no they're not I don't think so

[01:20:57.550 --> 01:21:01.510]
Well what can only when I was Chippy out there was a big black guy named Peter

[01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:04.050]
And it's a good thing for him Chris King didn't beat the crap out of him

[01:21:04.050 --> 01:21:08.290]
Yeah I heard his last comment last year in person but I didn't hear this this year

[01:21:08.290 --> 01:21:11.890]
I believe that he's bringing the tape tomorrow and I just I can't wait to get my hands on that

[01:21:11.890 --> 01:21:14.830]
I can't wait to hear that that's a true too

[01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:19.030]
Hey up here in Palm Beach remember where that priest was a Catholic priest

[01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:22.770]
was in trouble from less than all people over all the years

[01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:23.090]
Right

[01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:27.530]
That same church got hit by some vandals and these kids robbed it

[01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.770]
And they stole the place where they keep them

[01:21:30.490 --> 01:21:32.450]
They got Jesus' body

[01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:32.890]
Blood

[01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:33.530]
Yeah

[01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:37.850]
Yeah it's blood and body and they're all freaked out because well first all they stole it

[01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:41.430]
And they dropped out in the field and they just they just they just created his body

[01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:44.630]
Well God sure isn't doing a very good job of protecting his houses of worship

[01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:47.770]
But I tell you that all these churches getting burned down and vandalized and stuff

[01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:50.490]
He better get with the program and stuff weren't so much about ball games

[01:21:50.490 --> 01:21:53.430]
You know my neighbors go to that church and they don't go to that office

[01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:56.830]
I was informed I informed them over a weekend and that happened I said listen

[01:21:56.830 --> 01:22:00.550]
If you want to convince me that there's a God these guys were been dropped dead

[01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:03.230]
Right in the middle of the field I didn't stole that I believed them all

[01:22:03.230 --> 01:22:05.570]
I believed today right now that they're the God of that will have

[01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:09.570]
If they just got dropped in their tracks out in this field they robbed that thing

[01:22:09.570 --> 01:22:10.850]
Okay God bless you sir

[01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:12.370]
Hey Neil, I have a great life

[01:22:12.370 --> 01:22:15.310]
My wife wants to a gang but she calls it the Baptist Church

[01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:15.810]
Okay

5,6,7,0,5,60,0,5,60 on the 18th

[01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:22.990]
There's no facts in the church

[01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:23.790]
Why are you list line?

[01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:28.250]
How many years do you have to be molested before you decide that it was wrong

[01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:29.090]
You didn't like it

[01:22:31.330 --> 01:22:34.810]
110,755,2,000,1600

[01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:37.530]
Here's a mobile in Miami hello

[01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:38.110]
Hi Neil

[01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:38.590]
Yes sir

[01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:41.110]
I can tell you what a Denise said Saturday night

[01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.370]
Yeah

[01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:45.290]
You're trying to say shini hockey but I guess you had a little foot of the tongue

[01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:48.630]
Okay thanks that's what the guy said well let's wait till the tape comes all of a sudden now

[01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:51.950]
Everybody's on his said Denise Pipe had bad luck and now everybody heard it

[01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:54.330]
I'll put it on a guy called before he's got the tape

[01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:55.670]
Nobody heard it okay

[01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:59.310]
Now everybody in the brothers and not only they hear it but they all have a different version of it too

[01:22:59.310 --> 01:23:00.950]
I feel really really funny

[01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:01.390]
Yeah

[01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:05.570]
I mean when you look up the words dumb frog

[01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:08.590]
I've said this before but it bears repeating like on a daily basis

[01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:10.390]
Look up dumb frog in your dictionary

[01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:12.390]
And there will be a picture of Denise Puthan

[01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:13.410]
Old number five

[01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:18.070]

Hello I'm Camille yes sir how you doing great I'm Camille in regards to my Aunt Mariah Carey

[01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:50.690]
I saw her at the Oscars the other day and she's a house looks like she swallowed a baby elephant that's what the pictures look like she looks like she's ballooned up like somebody stuck a bicycle bump in her

[01:24:50.690 --> 01:24:56.570]
Correct though she's ballooned up the way D-fo has oh my God it's ridiculous and by the way I'm on my way to

[01:24:56.570 --> 01:25:01.370]
We can go country right now so if I see them together I'll say hello okay I was out of town

[01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:02.530]
Yeah Louise the kiss for me

[01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:08.870]
I was out of town last week but what was your dick on the the debacle the 911 debacle the what?

[01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:14.250]
The 911 debacle with the Panthers I was saying what do you mean debacle what do you mean debacle it was great

[01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:20.370]
Well for a Florida Panther fan that that I am but anyway for Toronto Maple Leaf fans which I am it was great

[01:25:20.370 --> 01:25:25.010]
Yeah we stayed two periods it was five to one to two that was enough for me and then I get back to the hotel

[01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:30.410]
Turn it on and find out the final score was nine to one I said how come we left you got to love the Panthers

[01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:36.050]
But the air Canada Center sir they're all the same they're all cookie cutter arenas there's no atmosphere

[01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:42.250]
There's no noise they had the same corn ball clips on the screen there the film clips it was a bitter disappointment

[01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:44.090]
And the seats that Rimmer got us sucked as well

[01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:45.090]
Really so

[01:25:45.090 --> 01:25:45.750]
So other than that

[01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:48.130]
Okay Neil wow thanks a lot

[01:25:48.130 --> 01:25:48.930]
And have a great day

[01:25:48.930 --> 01:25:50.410]
Thanks a lot

[01:25:50.410 --> 01:25:55.070]
Yeah yesterday morning we have our you know breakfast our brunch at JJ Mugs there by the

[01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:59.550]
Eating Center I had my little experience in my pants go back and you know freshen up

[01:25:59.550 --> 01:26:03.910]
And all of a sudden a little bit later it starts snowing out of the you know what a forecast at

[01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:06.710]
Cloudy rain in the afternoon well just a little bit off

[01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:13.290]
Like about two inches of snow in about two hours and everybody's freaking out the near pork. It's all screwed up

[01:26:13.290 --> 01:26:18.190]
I just want to say this okay because I can't stand delta. I hate delta we're going through Cincinnati

[01:26:18.190 --> 01:26:20.910]
We went up that way it was supposed to come back the same way and

[01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:28.170]
We go to the terminal three terminal one. I'm sorry terminal one there a person report delta and

[01:26:28.170 --> 01:26:33.690]
Everybody's backed up and every trend we forgot all the everything's all backed up now planes delay they had like an engine to have a

[01:26:33.690 --> 01:26:35.850]
Snow this is this is Toronto okay not

[01:26:39.330 --> 01:26:43.270]
Miami I got to understand if we had an engine to have this no on Miami it might screw things up a little bit

[01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:49.950]
Okay, it was like the world was coming to an end but they were very nice once we finally got up to the counter and we got on the American flight

[01:26:50.710 --> 01:26:55.270]
Non-stop out of Toronto which was on time miraculously and I want to say it one more time

[01:26:55.270 --> 01:27:00.230]
I know a lot of us were very pissed off with American even if we weren't flying them at the time during their strike and rightfully

[01:27:00.230 --> 01:27:03.230]
So it was a grotesque thing but like I told you last week

[01:27:03.230 --> 01:27:07.710]
Well, you fly wherever whoever's flying where you want to go. That's all you can't be that choosy if

[01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:12.110]
You want to go you go with whoever's going at the time you want to go

[01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:18.690]
And I know Hank was talking about the fact that unless you run certain flights you get based even in first class almost no food on

[01:27:18.690 --> 01:27:21.890]
American absolutely correct. He's right about that

[01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:25.470]
But wait, so pick a flight where they have a meal because the food on American Airlines

[01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:28.430]
I mean I'm gonna tell you it's not good. It's sensational

[01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:35.910]
For airplane food. It is phenomenal. God bless you American with your great food even though the one that pilots drive sucks

[01:27:37.150 --> 01:27:41.410]
That was bad, but you know, you got overlooked these things right come on a good meal

[01:27:41.410 --> 01:27:47.770]
Had a turkey brushed with zucchini man. It was good. She won your heart in the miracle worker

[01:27:47.770 --> 01:27:57.950]
Despite her handicaps. She left behind a lifetime of achievements and now with a discovery of rare audio jigs found in a basement somewhere in New Jersey

[01:27:58.430 --> 01:28:03.810]
Death Jan records makes available to you Helen Keller saves the blue

[01:31:07.410 --> 01:31:09.830]
almost right at center rice in the arena i have tremendous seats

[01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:13.410]
but i i the people that sit like way up in the corners and then those little

[01:31:13.410 --> 01:31:17.110]
narrow seats i wonder why they keep coming back what is it i mean they really

[01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:20.850]
such great loyal fans which i have a very hard time believing that i mean

[01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:24.830]
what is it that keeps bringing those people back i have great seats but they're up top

[01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:29.150]
but the great seats that you know that i can see the game and that's what i want to see

[01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:33.030]
i mean i i'm i'm telling you we had seats that were supposedly expensive seats

[01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:36.870]
in the zircan at the center toronto thirty night and that the seed what was going

[01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:40.430]
on in the other end you have to have binoculars i mean it was just too far away

[01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:44.570]
but i've walked around the arena and like i can see the go lights when they come on

[01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:49.430]
i can see everything from my seat i see your seats but it's just that's a hassle

[01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:53.210]
now it's just like it's often games became a hassle the marines became a hassle

[01:31:53.210 --> 01:31:57.030]

here's a lady mobile in west pond beach hello

[01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:36.610]
hey nil yes man i was fortunate enough to be listening when potman said that

[01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:39.450]
the other night he did that again he blankety game

[01:32:39.450 --> 01:32:43.490]
oh i have to move out of the room and i screamed my husband pop and he said it

[01:32:43.490 --> 01:32:47.410]
i get him he's an asshole wow i believe one guy that guy has it on tape

[01:32:47.410 --> 01:32:50.250]
so you can hear it i can't wait for this yeah it was great

[01:32:50.250 --> 01:32:51.730]
that's for the good news okay

[01:32:51.730 --> 01:32:56.410]
yeah the these potman are more on of the month not just for April but any

[01:32:56.410 --> 01:32:59.810]
month you pick any year you pick he is a moron

[01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:04.330]
five six seven oh five i mean i can understand that when the game was over

[01:33:04.330 --> 01:33:06.930]
that it was pretty shiny or whatever sounds like that

[01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:11.090]
pantheon getting wild nine to one the biggest loss in the history of their

[01:33:11.090 --> 01:33:15.450]
organization by the way the biggest uh... margin of the feet also

[01:33:15.850 --> 01:33:19.090]
first time they forgive up nine goals in the game leave it to the end and you know

[01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:22.170]
the sad part of it is if he didn't watch the game well maybe was said if he

[01:33:22.170 --> 01:33:26.230]
did watch it was that in the first period for most of the first period like we've

[01:33:26.230 --> 01:33:29.910]
seen so many other panther games the least weren't the least but interest in that

[01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:32.590]
game they did just uh... you could tell they had no interest

[01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:37.390]
and all of a sudden uh... you know panthers caught up a couple real easy goals

[01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:39.890]
there at the end of the period and they said well you know we do need the two

[01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:42.570]
points we're trying to self-worth please okay let's kick the race

[01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:43.790]
and they did

[01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:47.330]
here's a mobile and jupiter hello

[01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:49.210]
and i didn't see sir

[01:33:49.210 --> 01:33:53.270]
i think i can explain why on some of these all these arenas are now

[01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:54.510]
becoming so superficial

[01:33:55.670 --> 01:33:58.410]
because uh... if you try to cater to a real hockey fan

[01:33:58.410 --> 01:34:02.790]
like uh... you are kind of i am to i mean how many fans are going to be there

[01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:05.430]
especially in my amy how many how about in Toronto

[01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:08.490]
why do they have to i mean they got the best hockey fans in the world there

[01:34:08.490 --> 01:34:12.490]
why do they have to bring in all this plastic stuff all this prefabricated

[01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:16.650]
contrive bull crap on the scoreboard the gene hackman thing with a phonial

[01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:20.530]
applause to try to get the crowd i mean i'm sorry but it did just made me want to

[01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:24.470]
try to see that into here you can expect it because here these people that's what they go

[01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:27.190]
forward the contrive crap they don't even understand what's going on

[01:34:27.190 --> 01:34:30.430]
that's the only thing i was uh... thinking about all the shouldn't have to do that

[01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:33.310]
but around here if they just cater to the real fans we have uh...

[01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:37.430]
and i'm gonna tell you it's not working up there either if anything it's having a

[01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:40.550]
backlash because uh... i mean that crowd is gotten so combatoes

[01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:43.650]
like i said every time i jump up and cheer i look around me and i thought

[01:34:43.650 --> 01:34:45.870]
she'd better sit down and make an ass out of yourself

[01:34:46.290 --> 01:34:50.230]
as much as i hate to say it i i definitely enjoyed watching the game in the old

[01:34:50.230 --> 01:34:53.010]
of my memory and better than i do now i agree absolutely

[01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:56.870]
so i do have a good day and meanwhile you're a big fat goose bag

[01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:59.810]
all right maybe he'll be in Vegas soon that's where the fat people go that's

[01:34:59.810 --> 01:35:02.010]
what we hear you hear that fat people in Vegas

[01:35:03.930 --> 01:35:08.270]
have a funny part of that is i don't i mean you i look i started to say before

[01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:10.050]
before interrupted myself when you go to Vegas

[01:35:10.630 --> 01:35:13.690]
uh... most places you see a lot of really beautiful people

[01:35:13.690 --> 01:35:15.370]
like especially the mgm grand

[01:35:16.650 --> 01:35:20.790]
beautiful people young people living in breathing people people

[01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:22.590]
actually like our uh... human

[01:35:24.450 --> 01:35:26.090]
which you don't see too many of those here

[01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:30.210]
really know you have to really scour the countryside to see any way that looks

[01:35:30.210 --> 01:35:33.870]
like a real like i said living in breathing for but you know nothing's perfect

[01:35:33.870 --> 01:35:37.030]
we got that nice weather was 120 70s today in the shade

[01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:40.790]
nothing like leaving a snowstorm in the middle of April

[01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:43.770]
with two inches of snow on the ground and the temperature must have been

[01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:46.270]
right about thirty three or thirty four degrees because it was like hovering

[01:35:46.270 --> 01:35:49.390]
right in between and coming in you get on the plane in the pilot says

[01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:52.130]
all nice weather down in my mind the current temperature is 94

[01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:58.310]
if i didn't have bad for you when you keep those extreme temperature changes

[01:35:58.310 --> 01:36:02.890]
doesn't look like me because i'm starting to like a little frog i just thinking about it

[01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:05.390]
a little bit of a frog in my throat

[01:41:33.290 --> 01:41:37.430]
which concourse do you think has most of the hanky panky going on late at night at Miami International

[01:41:38.290 --> 01:41:45.030]
i'd say merkin airlines that what is that its concourse see that what it is see

[01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:51.910]
well i bet there's some wild stuff going on there late at night after the last plane has gone out and come in

[01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:55.130]
after the last path of zeros have you know going down the hallway

[01:41:56.150 --> 01:42:03.110]

[01:42:03.110 --> 01:42:07.310]
i heard the sound of drills pneumatic drills

[01:42:09.130 --> 01:42:16.190]
by the way George admitted to me on a Friday that he has never seen a glory hole in his life

[01:42:17.410 --> 01:42:20.670]

[01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:34.630]
you're the one alright there's one I knew we get some interest if we pumped it enough

[01:42:35.310 --> 01:42:41.430]
you know I have even tickets to the Marlins this season so I guess I'm the only one that I'll care for

[01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:44.950]
so why now why do you have tickets to the Marlins games

[01:42:45.490 --> 01:42:49.890]

[01:42:49.890 --> 01:42:51.450]
yeah but I'm not seeing very much

[01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:59.990]
well I'm serious most of what I've seen this year has been so painful that I wouldn't categorize it as going and really seeing the entertaining hockey game

[01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:02.190]
I enjoy hockey but I don't want to see crap

[01:43:02.590 --> 01:43:06.490]
well that's kind of what we're getting on the baseball field now but you know at that point

[01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:10.330]
you just hope that sometime you'll see something good

[01:43:10.330 --> 01:43:14.730]
yeah that's the way I look at okay have a great day I always hope for seeing something good

[01:43:14.730 --> 01:43:21.030]

two polite two polite say something maybe there was one group of guys goal leaves go they were trying to get you know

[01:43:41.050 --> 01:43:46.450]
the crowd pumped up and forget it I mean granted it was the very website of game very shortly after that

[01:43:46.450 --> 01:43:51.150]
especially after the first period but I mean get into it a little bit we're having a great year baby

[01:51:58.870 --> 01:52:04.390]

[01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:25.530]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line obviously asked a question today that's a little bit too complex a little bit too difficult for asking people why they go to these places

[01:52:25.530 --> 01:52:34.390]
okay I know that's a little bit of a tough question like if I were standing by the escalator there at the macarena went denied and I stopped all these people saying why are you here tonight

[01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:43.530]
what did you come for what would be the answer to your question the game is on television free why are you here tonight and they would go

[01:52:43.530 --> 01:52:54.350]
you know how they would go like that I keep asking all these things that they can't answer because you know something they don't have the answer themselves they don't know why

[01:52:55.690 --> 01:53:04.370]
here's Kate Coral hello let me add to your list of a fact professions I consider myself the only straight member of this particular profession as funeral directors

[01:53:05.250 --> 01:53:18.270]
really particularly in Howard why didn't know that oh my god it's they're everywhere not you know not that I have a problem right but yeah they seem to be attracted to professional not sure why maybe staring at others old naked men all day

[01:53:18.270 --> 01:53:27.650]
maybe staring at stiffs yeah but yeah there seems to be a lot of gay people in funeral directors and now we do have to arrange a lot of flowers but I'm not sure if that's the easy one

[01:53:27.650 --> 01:53:32.790]
maybe that's it maybe those panties might have come in handy but they're attracted that's a put that on your list okay thank you okay

[01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:51.990]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line not that he's one you do understand we believe him huh we believe him here's a mobile in pompino hello yeah three words for a week we don't care listen did you catch any of that what does that mean I mean I agree somebody call as I call what is most ridiculous crap it's unbelievable

[01:53:52.550 --> 01:54:01.830]

[01:54:25.050 --> 01:54:32.610]
that Pittsburgh and Toronto I don't like that match up though I'd rather hit three into one of what that that's not going to be the match up in a playoffs I don't know

[01:54:32.610 --> 01:54:40.250]
figure that you think you think the penguins are going to finish fifth yeah well they they got the Rangers they got the Rangers and the Islanders out of their next three games yeah I really

[01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:48.270]
feel he's got to play Buffalo I know that yeah so one of those guys getting points and don't forget Buffalo's got four games left you guys only got three games Buffalo's got four games left

[01:54:48.270 --> 01:54:57.830]
well personally I hope it's Pittsburgh and Carolina I'd love six bucks I'd love to see that yeah but I if you guys if I'm you guys I'm written for Buffalo to move up ahead of Philly

[01:54:57.830 --> 01:55:04.410]
why is that Philly scary I mean either you're banged up I would I would suggest you that Buffalo's probably got a little bit better

[01:55:04.410 --> 01:55:09.990]
gold-titting than Philadelphia I could be wrong about that but I don't know you could be right as usual right could be right as usual I will not

[01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:16.510]
well hey we're happy just to be in fourth place pal we'll take it all these lean years we're we're thrilled and in closing

[01:55:16.510 --> 01:55:23.170]

[01:55:32.490 --> 01:55:34.090]
here's a mobile and bureau B cello

[01:55:35.290 --> 01:55:42.190]

[01:55:43.710 --> 01:55:49.330]
you know they're obligated to go I you're right about that I feel like I've been obligated to go in fact

[01:55:49.330 --> 01:55:53.750]
I don't think I'm even going to go by the going Wednesday why should I go these last two games I mean the

[01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:57.530]
the quality of what I'm seeing is the whole team's injured anyway what's the point what am I going to

[01:55:57.530 --> 01:56:01.970]
accomplish as though I have some kind of obligation to somebody to be there because I got the tickets what's

[01:56:01.970 --> 01:56:06.910]
the point I mean I've been I've lived in New York I've lived in Cleveland good now that I've been to some

[01:56:06.910 --> 01:56:12.890]
games and good fans and I came down here I'm a big doll from fan and I even had I had the opportunity to

[01:56:12.890 --> 01:56:18.590]
go to the Super Bowl big hype that's all it was yeah I was disappointed it was like and the

[01:56:18.590 --> 01:56:21.970]
Super Bowl's not for the fans anyway it's for all the you know hot shots I think you're more

[01:56:21.970 --> 01:56:27.030]
tall of the thing I mean I was I was way up top in it you know it didn't matter I was there

[01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:31.490]
was a once in a life I mean there's there's an event I mean professional football television and

[01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:35.690]
football it's a marriage made in heaven that's why the NFL was lucky as it wasn't got to be where

[01:56:35.690 --> 01:56:40.490]
it did was because of television because it is perfect in fact it looks better on television by far

[01:56:40.490 --> 01:56:49.190]
that it doesn't person and great day okay you're crap it out and that's the truth five six seven

[01:56:49.190 --> 01:56:52.970]
oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line yeah they don't want they people from the

[01:56:52.970 --> 01:56:56.150]
Macarena they don't want to admit it they don't want to admit they're there to be seen and

[01:56:56.150 --> 01:57:00.750]
smooth with their friends they couldn't give a crap less what the score is who the teams are that

[01:57:00.750 --> 01:57:04.430]
are playing they don't know the names in ninety percent of the people that's before all the injuries by

[01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:11.710]
the way and now forget it they don't want to admit that but like I said I'm I'm I'm gonna start

[01:57:11.710 --> 01:57:15.830]
being a hell of a lot more selective and if people are gonna call say well you know you didn't

[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:21.080]
you're out for this game you know what tough crap that's my business too bad tough to pay this

[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:30.520]
know you must attend otherwise you're not the maven or whatever the hell I don't give a crap

[01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:38.300]
people going to places where they seem to have less than no interest just list I am and like I

[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:43.320]
said the air can of the center in a city where they live breathe and eat hockey where they sleep

[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:47.280]
where they have a puck deep inside their recto and sometimes think and these people were like

[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:51.820]
most of the game at least in my section of course leave it to remember to put me in the dead

[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:57.040]
section oh it's only five rows below the air Canada club yeah like way up in the uh boom docks

[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:04.340]
up there in the red seats I got I got I got red eyes just from trying to squint to see what was

[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:08.520]
going on the other end the whole game I know there's somebody way down there I think there's a

[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:17.060]
goalie and then I wait on the other end there huh sorry 21 before one man we're creeping up on

[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:23.740]

[01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:28.140]

[01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:53.080]
shellacking tonight game time 730. WQAM. How you doing sir? I'm a lobster buddy. You're

[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:57.640]
a what? A lobster. Meaning what? I sat in Ricefield to watch that model game yesterday.

[01:59:57.820 --> 02:00:01.780]
Many acts. Let me tell you. Okay now let me ask you this. They said 14,000 some do you

[02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:04.820]
think that that was accurate? How did it look out there? I can see anything to

[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:09.820]
go around so so so big. Yeah. Let me tell you something they should be able. If you

[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:12.380]
say to Ricefield you should be able to bring them brothers in there because that is

[02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:16.320]
that is a damn torture man. And this is all this is only not even the middle of

[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:18.980]
April yet. I don't think it should be able to bring a decent on

[02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:22.560]
broad to cover yourself because you will get skin cancer sitting there for a full

[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:27.080]
season. There's no doubt about it. There is no doubt about it. If John Henry wants

[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:31.060]
public support for a dumb stadium he should start in Ricefield okay. Okay or

[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:37.080]
get or get the money from the dermatologist to South Florida. There you go. This

[02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:41.660]
lesion brought to you by the dermatologist to South Florida. And maybe they can

[02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:46.820]
have the American lesion sponsored the new stadium. 5 6 7 0 5 60, 0 5 5 60 on the

[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:25.360]
the beesleaves if I went over there. I don't want to see them. Give me 2D press. I know what you

[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:29.680]
mean. After living in Miami for 37 years I was dumb enough to come over here but I'm

[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:34.240]
going to do. Yeah. That's about the only way to go and make you appreciate here. Well,

[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:38.460]
I don't know. When I come back over there I can't leave fast enough. Okay. Like I said, this

[02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:42.180]
is the only place you can visit that would make you appreciate over there. Yeah. That's

[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:48.060]
about the way it goes. Okay. Jim. Well, go blades go. Go blades go. Okay. Have a great

[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:54.580]

[02:01:54.580 --> 02:02:01.520]
mobile one line. Here's a mobile in high a. Hello. By the way, Bokar Brian was looking for the

[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:05.180]
crowd on the way to the Marlin game today when he was coming down from Bokar. Didn't realize

[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:11.580]
the game is in New York. Mobile in high a. Hello. Going once. Going twice. Must have got

[02:02:11.580 --> 02:02:15.140]
out for the cut fights. Here's a mobile in Bokar. Hello. Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay, sir.

[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:18.780]
I call you around a month ago to tell you about the fixed races at three hole. Yeah.

[02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:22.560]
The three drivers will found guilty yesterday. Well, I hate to break the news to you, sir, but

[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:25.680]
George Brennan, you know, again, I don't believe you because George Brennan's been driving

[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:31.760]
in the middle and I will talk to you. Yes, but a meal. Yeah. Spension starts today. Yeah. Okay.

[02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:35.720]
They're bought from freehold. They're repealing at the six months. The spend. Well, they're

[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:40.420]
bars from freehold. What about the middle? Because the freehold is a public is a privately

[02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:46.300]
on track. The metal and the state owns part of it. While they appeal, they can still drive

[02:02:46.300 --> 02:02:50.980]
at the metal land. Yeah. If they found guilty. If they lose their appeal, they're bought from

[02:02:50.980 --> 02:02:54.960]
the metal land two for six months for six months. Yep. Also, what's the big deal with that?

[02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:58.720]
Hey, you know, and not only that and it's freehold gets to keep all the money. They didn't pay

[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:02.720]
out to the to the patrons. Great. You know, the, you know, the, and Jack Lee will probably come back

[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:08.440]
and want a piece of it. Well, the carnal's coming to. Okay. We'll post you later. Whatever you say.

[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:15.840]
Oh, God. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line. As we continue our search, it's a never ending.

[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:20.880]
It's an ongoing search for years and years. We've been searching and looking and squeezing

[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:27.240]
and grasping. Have we found it yet? No. There's a mobile in Avengera. Hello. Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:32.600]
Okay, sir. I've spoken to you a couple of times in the past. I still love your show. I want to talk to

[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:39.460]
you a little bit about sports. I'm a listener. What? Sports. Sports. You've been talking about how this is not a sports

[02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:47.620]
town. I agree with you 100%. These people out here think. Why does it have to be a sports town? See,

[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:51.320]
that was what I made the point I made before. Why does it have to be a sports town? First of all,

[02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:55.780]
the median age here is 100. So why should it be a sports town? Exactly. And then all these

[02:03:55.780 --> 02:04:00.120]
banana boat people, then the only sport they care about, like cock fighting and, you know, stuff like that.

[02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:04.040]
You want to go to a real American sport? You want to go to a real city, go to the city of Cleveland.

[02:04:04.540 --> 02:04:08.020]
Jacob. I want to go. Why would I want to go to Cleveland? I've been there. That's a toilet. I don't

[02:04:08.020 --> 02:04:12.220]
want to go to Cleveland. If you're going to Jacob's field. No, I don't want to go there. I wouldn't go to

[02:04:12.220 --> 02:04:16.300]
Cleveland if you paid me by the minute. What the hell are you going to see there? I was born at my hometown.

[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:19.600]
Oh, by the way, it's my birthday. Okay, well, happy birthday, you, sir.

[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:30.020]
No call us again. Please. Okay, we got 16 minutes to kill until a baseball time. Are we going to do it? No,

[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:35.200]
I don't think so. It's been a real dicey Monday here. I'll tell you that. They just don't want to

[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:40.220]
mess up. They will not confess their sins on this show. Why they waste their time and they could

[02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:45.300]
sit there on their fat ass having a great time enjoying themselves be comfortable. And they go

[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:48.900]
out there and they create all that traffic and they go to these places and they get ripped off and

[02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:53.300]
pay this wild extravagant amount of money and they go see a product to say second rate would be a

[02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:58.280]
major overstatement. Okay, or understatement depending on how you look at it. A tenth rate product

[02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:03.940]
and leave there and leave their bitching and moaning and grumbling. I hear them all the time on

[02:05:03.940 --> 02:05:07.860]
the way out out of the arena down that escalator. They're bitching and screaming. If you, you guys,

[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:13.960]
you suck it, you know, and they keep coming back just like me. We're a bunch of massacres.

[02:05:15.980 --> 02:05:19.400]
Just like coming back to this place all the time. At least there's a paycheck waiting at the

[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:24.320]
end of the rainbow. That's the only thing to come back here for and to go to camaraderie with all the

[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:30.580]
nice people that work around this job. Now there's some nice people here at Josh Friedman. Here's Miami.

[02:05:30.580 --> 02:05:36.320]
Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Oh, yeah. How you doing? Okay. I'm with the rest of the other day and they

[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:40.980]
tried to offer me some flam. What does flam? It looks like it's not slime. It's not there. You think

[02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:46.080]
it's good, but it's not fine. Okay, one call left on the board. Here we go. 15 minutes. I can

[02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:49.640]
understand we die right at the top of the hour when you got the Marlon baseball game coming out with

[02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:53.720]
a myth that nobody in there right mind would listen. But here we got 15 minutes to kill and that's it.

[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:56.940]
That's the that's the cruxier material here on a Monday.

[02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:04.040]
5 6 7. I'll let you do the last 15 minutes. Okay. They like talking about that fact. You were talking

[02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:10.520]
about on a key and a Reeves. Quit picking on him. Okay, just because he looks like what's his name

[02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:17.520]
that you hate? Don't say it's a damn. No, same. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line.

[02:06:17.620 --> 02:06:22.440]
George has got to think against Venezuela. In fact, anybody that isn't Cuban George, basically

[02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:28.740]
or ain't too crazy about. Here's a mobile in Hylia. Hello. Hylio. Yes, sir. Can you feel the heat

[02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:32.960]
in your mouth? Yeah, feel this. Get out of here, Sam. See, that's the problem being up here on

[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:37.620]
the third floor. Okay, go back to some work. I know that's not a new vocabulary. Go do something

[02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:45.440]
productive. Also not new vocabulary. And close the door on the way out, Sam. See a Drew. Your friend,

[02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:51.820]
Gianni. Here's plantation. Hello. Nihil. Yes, sir. Why do these people complain about sitting in the

[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:57.380]
key there for the mall and the dolphins playing September one o'clock in the afternoon with 72,000

[02:06:57.380 --> 02:07:01.060]
people there? You won't see me out there. Same son. You won't see me out there. That's right. If

[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:05.200]
they're on the sunset, if that's sitting there, baking their brains out. Take it out. Even with all those

[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:10.380]
people, even those worklockings, you spit your guts out. Am I right? Absolutely right. Fits

[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:14.140]
in over there. And then these people, they don't even know what they're doing there. They don't

[02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:18.560]
know. They just get sucked into it. It's the American FN way. Somebody convinced them that this is

[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:23.680]
what life is all about. They're in La La land. These people have a good and back to you. I

[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:27.400]
mean, I'd come back here. I could have told you boy, that crowd in Toronto, those people were great.

[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:31.640]
And that arena was really the atmosphere and air was spent. And that wasn't either of the above. It

[02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:39.440]
was depressing. It was a gigantic. I mean, unbelievably depressing situation. Forgetting about the

[02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:45.100]
game, which I love the course. I'm so good about that. I mean, not anything like what I thought it

[02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:54.320]
was going to experience. Like being in a time warp. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line. We

[02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:57.440]
keep, we'll keep plugging along. We'll make it toward the top of the hour. We'll get up there to

[02:07:57.440 --> 02:08:02.180]
that goddamn ballgame with you like it or not. Because guess what? It's coming, baby. Squared Squared.

[02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:08.780]
Game two. We had that one lady. It's always a lady. It's always some broad out there. Oh yeah,

[02:08:08.780 --> 02:08:13.220]
I'm going to be listening to my own. I'm not talking about women. Okay. We don't have any women

[02:08:13.220 --> 02:08:15.780]
listening anyway. We had women listening. We'd have a 30 share.

[02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:23.480]
Women are too watching. They're too, too, too watching. Wiki watchy. They're too busy watching

[02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:27.160]
that crap on TV. They were watching Jerry Springer. They're watching all that slime on their

[02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:33.700]
on TV. Jenny Jones watching people blowing each other's brains out. All that's all those

[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:37.360]
snuff shows on TV. I used to watch them, but I finally said that's snuff.

[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:45.780]
74 1 at 5 60 WQM. See, I could actually kill the time in between here and go to the doctor,

[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:50.360]
but I can't eat. That's the problem. He knows that, too. I can't eat because I'm going to do blood test.

[02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:52.700]
So I can't eat.

[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:15.940]
Oh, I love the liquid and that is why I become a singing lesbian.

[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:25.040]
Mr. Mary Catherine was so impressed with what I done. She gave the action with her son.

[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:32.540]
Can you see for safety leaves? That's it. Some went to number one. Because I was on none.

[02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:38.940]
Sound away to make some hash and hope the royal piece will last because retired none.

[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:46.580]
Don't get none. I never made it that big because I didn't look that great. So I got the

[02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:54.220]
young who have it. Two in drugs and getting laid. Had my one and only hit him and the Vatican got hit.

[02:09:54.780 --> 02:10:01.680]
The hope said there's my big now that I'm dead. I can't reveal how much I wanted Sally

[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:05.220]
to go with my wheel.

[02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:11.840]
1259 at 560 WQM. Well, that picked me up a little bit. Now I feel better.

[02:10:12.260 --> 02:10:16.720]
Usually, the book of Brian comes around and gets depressed. Oh, time show, man, died. What am I going to do?

[02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:22.120]
They're going to know me up there. They don't know you. Just walk, just waddle in there.

[02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:25.280]
It's all there's that depressing guy from Florida again. They don't know who you are.

[02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:28.160]
Here's a mobile and bouquet. Hello.

[02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:30.200]
Yeah, how are you? Okay, sir.

[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:33.400]
There's some long time listener. You have a great show. Yes, I did.

[02:10:33.460 --> 02:10:37.220]
Pack me up. Listen, I want to know what your opinion is. Oh, I'm sorry, but that's nothing I can do about it.

[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:41.820]
I want to know what your opinion is. I hear you criticize and cut down fun office and coaching of our

[02:10:41.820 --> 02:10:48.380]
marlins, our panthers, our dolphins. I'll talk to you. You'll criticize it. What you criticize about

[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:54.060]
is just say the heat in Pat Riley. They seem like this such a clean click. I'm not interested in the

[02:10:54.060 --> 02:11:00.120]
heats. I couldn't care less. I couldn't care the least bit in Pat Riley. I don't have an opinion.

[02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:05.780]
Sure you don't. No, I don't. They're the only sports team that let me say it again. I couldn't care less if

[02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:11.780]
I tried. I don't care. No, I will not. And I won't. Okay. And you can continue baiting and baiting and

[02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:15.740]
baiting and masturbating. Whatever else it is you're doing, sir. And to play in your game. I'm not

[02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:21.120]
interested. I don't give a crap whether they run well. This isn't a sports show. Number one.

[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:27.000]
In case you haven't noticed it's not an FN sports show. And sports nerds like you that that's all

[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:32.640]
you can talk about. Shame on you, sir. Let me say it again. Pat Riley listens to the show. He knows

[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:37.960]
basketball sucks. He knows it's a big bunch of seven foot freaks. He knows it's a pile of crap.

[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:42.480]
He loves this show because I'm the one guy in this station that's got the balls to tell

[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:47.040]
it like it is about that crap. And thank God for depot this morning. Finally,

[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:50.280]
grow a little pair over the weekend. Maybe got lucky this weekend with a Zon again off

[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:55.960]
again marriage and again out and again marriage. Talking about the draft and all the idiotic draft

[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:00.200]
nicks out there and he's silly no life people that make a big like this is some kind of a sporting

[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:04.160]
event like it's some kind of an activity. Something that people with a brain out of he interested in

[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:10.880]
which we know it's not. Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line.

[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:13.880]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir.

[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:18.560]
An issue you went through a couple weeks ago you kind of counter-dicking yourself here, pal.

[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:22.900]
About what? You said that you're you're tired of going to hockey games and different people

[02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:26.780]
sitting around you they're giving their tickets up they're not showing up and then you sit here

[02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:31.200]
and you talk about you're not going to go anymore and you've had it. I didn't say I'm not

[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:34.900]
going to go anymore. I said I'm not going to go to the last two games. Neil, come on. Sir,

[02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:41.000]
are you looking you have a conversation? Now, is that possible? Oh my god. Okay. Another asshole.

[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:47.840]
Another asshole. I'm asking you, sir. I'm asking you why do people go if they don't find it

[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:52.160]
entertaining and what I'm saying is that it hasn't been entertaining for a long time and to feel like

[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:57.800]
I'm obligated to go to last two games I'm probably not going to go. Is there anything contradictory

[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:02.960]
about that? No. No, there is not. And I've asked a million times by the way I'm not

[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:06.960]
contradicting at all. I've asked a zillion times during the course of this season why people are going

[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:10.620]
to that macarena since they don't even have an interest. I have an interest in the team and the

[02:13:10.620 --> 02:13:15.060]
sports release when I do go I have it. I have a reason why I go. A legitimate honest to God

[02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:19.700]
reason. Not just to sit there and smooth around and be seen by people and walk around and

[02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:23.760]
stay up in front of everybody else and act like a jackass but you can't have a conversation.

[02:13:24.060 --> 02:13:31.380]
Can you? No. No, you can. Oh, I sure got you. Go back and put another

[02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:37.440]
jaw on your cheek. Okay, sir. Back to that cheek too. Here's Daniel. Hello. Hey, how you doing,

[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:41.820]
Neil? Okay, sir. Good. Neil, my question to a lot of these people down here is. What is your

[02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:47.340]
question, sir? My question is all these people down here that don't like it here and brag about

[02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:52.900]
Cincinnati and brag about New York and brag about Canada. It would be nice to see them all

[02:13:52.900 --> 02:13:59.800]
ahead north of 595. Yeah. That's all. Okay, that's a original. That's a original, sir. Take the

[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:04.500]
bag with you and don't leave it or however that little bumper sticker goes. That's a original.

[02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:08.540]
Maybe maybe a lot of these people have a point. Do you ever think of that, sir? No.

[02:14:08.700 --> 02:14:12.520]
No. Maybe people like you are the reason that some people are unhappy with it down here. Do you

[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:16.860]
ever consider that, sir? No. Here's sport Lauderdale. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir.

[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:21.620]
I need a how you doing? Okay. Great. I've not listened to the whole show today, but I just have

[02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:26.580]
a couple of little topics for you. Couple of little topics. A little bit. A minute and a half to go

[02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:33.000]
and you're going to do the topic. Okay, real quickly. Is there any, I'm serious. Is Pat Riley was

[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:40.100]
no? The he, the, um, am I? Here's a mobile and crawl spring. Hello.

[02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:44.800]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing? Hey, listen. I'd rather hear about Rick Riley than

[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:47.960]
Pat Riley any day of the week and I mean, I want to think about Rick Riley. Yes, sir.

[02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:56.000]
I'm from Boston. Yeah. And I went to the new fleet center up there and I was very

[02:14:56.380 --> 02:15:00.860]
disappointed. Right. Same problem. That's right. And a lot of empty seats too because it's prefabricated.

[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:04.780]
These people don't understand what I'm talking about. I've been, I've been trying to convey a message

[02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:08.120]
here all day and you're, we finally get to the end of the show you the first person that knows what

[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:12.480]
I'm talking about. You know, since the seats they used to go straight up in the air and he was sitting

[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:17.340]
right on top of the ring. But now they've got them situated where you really, you know, it sucks

[02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:21.080]
the good old game anymore. Yeah, you can't see a goddamn thing. You were a million miles away.

[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:26.500]
All right. Well, God bless the Boston ruins anyway. Okay. Well, I'll need it. Okay. They'll need a

[02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:31.360]
blessing. They're doing okay. They got that famous in us. Okay. That's going to do it. See,

[02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:34.880]
you know, what they want to do? They don't like the message. So let's attack the messenger. Okay.

[02:15:34.940 --> 02:15:38.460]
We can't really, we can't discuss it with you because we don't have the capacity to do that

[02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:42.580]
because it's a very reasonable and logical and rational thing that you're saying. We can't do that.

[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:46.460]
So instead of that, we'll attack you because we like doing that. And you know what? I couldn't

[02:15:46.460 --> 02:15:50.940]
give a flying craft bless. How do you like that? You like it? Good. I do too. And have a nice

[02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:56.740]
F&D. Oh my God. We got, we got a baseball game. Cutting up. We're just finding to get and

[02:15:56.740 --> 02:16:00.920]
look at that momentum. We got it. We got a call on there. And now we got to get the hell out of

[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:07.960]
here for our dumb ball game. The Neil Roger show on 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale.
