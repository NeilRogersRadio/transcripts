Your boy's sound just like a saddened year old girl.

[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.520]
A little sports show.

[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.320]
Who needs a little training?

[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.680]
Like until on their snap.

[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.440]
You don't sound like a man.

[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.020]
We move so rubber fast.

[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.600]
That joke.

[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.840]

Your lucky man is a gentle girl.

[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.620]
Kelsey.

[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.160]
You don't belong there on the air.

[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.900]
And, Kelsey.

[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.660]
The sports can wait till your voice cracks.

[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.200]
Of anyone who sounds like that should find another job.

[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.920]
And they should only take you back when both your baby's

[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.920]
drop.

[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.120]

Kelsey.

[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.180]

[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.260]
When you're going to grow up.

[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.160]
You make us want to grow up.

[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.180]

[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.600]
you're a .

[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.700]
Hot,

[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.420]
back but they have no comeback and to make up stories about what is it what

[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.560]
did you think about that beat those bm buttons and about that top-of-the-stereo

[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.420]
trade unless you think about now first of all I was the one from the beginning

[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.680]
I liked the top-of-the-stereo trade and I said that Mark Parrish are allegedly

[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.740]
was a hell of a player and he turned out to be I never knocked that trade now

[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.460]
when it comes to stew barns and Marty Strocka I didn't hear Geltie say

[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.560]
nothing about that and I didn't hear him to respond but what I said yesterday

[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.120]
morning because he can't respond because again he got it wrong about Theo

[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.060]
Flurry and playing on the first line in the power play for Colorado and

[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.120]
blah blah blah you know just talking a lot talking up the storm and of

[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.220]
course when he's got other people sitting in that room and don't know nothing

[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.340]
about what he's discussing it's easy to get a free pass on it including the

[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.640]
audience like that jackass who I know is listening right now listening right

[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.840]
now that I heard the call oh yeah well no other sports station in America do

[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.700]
we have to listen to some fag in midday pocket fag hockey talk now I want you

[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.520]
to stop and think about that do we have to listen and of course here's another

[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.780]
one of these guys who could quote you chapter and verse everything that I say

[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.060]
on this radio show and you know he's listening right now and when it comes to

[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.620]
fag's pal I got news for there's plenty of facts in fact madditch was tell me

[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.720]
was down here a couple of weeks ago tell me that when he was playing for the

[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.460]
dolphins there were like at least a half a dozen guys on the team that were

[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.400]
screaming fags

[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.880]
and a lot of guys used to shower like one end I don't want to say which end

[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.160]
air be sport pal where everywhere everywhere you go there's fags I hate to

[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.020]
break the news yet and you don't have to leave this building by the way there's

[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.280]
lots of us there's fags all over this building

[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.540]
we're up to our all right no we're up to our back in fags well I got my sole water

[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.300]
here blocking my finger okay but jody man I'll tell you see if you want to stick

[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.000]
with information if you want to respond to what I'm talking about fine but you

[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.540]
can't do it so again let's make an attack he's on the air begging for people

[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.760]
looking graduate I didn't even know it was my 23rd anniversary I came back

[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.180]
Monday from vacation forgot all about it and Georgia course it set up all these

[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.280]
contrived deals here and they bring down the cake in the party in the parking lot

[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.220]
and the yeah I'm on the air begging for cost 23 years yeah yeah must be a

[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.380]
money or 23 years in Miami gully because I don't have any talent because I

[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.460]
don't know what I'm talking about because the audience out there is not

[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.860]
entertained all those ratings all those numbers that come in I have the

[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.800]
fix in in Belfield Maryland I know I have a big in up there I know somebody

[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.860]
there I'm paying somebody off they're all bogus it's all a bunch of bull crap

[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.360]
so it must be pretty desperate there in the morning that they were huckin

[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.800]
a tronicky and instead of talking about the fact instead of giving up

[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.640]
opinions but and of course like I said the other day you can do that in this

[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.900]
town because they only deal with the personalities like that jack asked to call

[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.940]
the I had a body guy you know back down I'm so proud you didn't back down all

[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.980]
only dealing with personalities not with factor with substance or knowledge or

[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.000]
information because most of the people in this town don't have any knowledge

[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.600]
when it comes to sports or much of any other topic you picked a topic and they're

[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.300]
going we'll live it like that that's just the nature of this town so he can go

[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.140]
on here and make up all kinds of stories and suck Brian Marie's ass until there's

[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:32.920]
just nothing left in it okay and you know life goes on and I still stay you

[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.240]
know Marty Strock has got 29 goals two bars has got 19 oh yeah Pittsburgh's he's

[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.240]
been on the outs with him he's got 19 that's two more than anybody on a

[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.180]
Panthers it got so far by the way Brian Marie's done some good things he's made a

[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.480]
lot of mistakes a lot of bad mistakes okay so you try to be objective not just

[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.200]
a professional ass sucker like Yelda who's on the payroll so you want your

[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.400]
on the payroll for an organization that immediately you have no credibility

[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.160]
left none zero so no matter what you say like it takes us back a year ago a

[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.360]
year ago now at that horrendous time when they had that the coach show with

[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:13.320]
BM in the morning on Tuesday mornings how could anybody forget those days and if

[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.020]
you weren't we've actually had Christina Moore had to come in and be the referee

[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.920]
the pivot man to screen the calls to make sure that there were no tough calls

[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.880]
coming in for the thin skin BM because you just couldn't take it so I mean you

[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.580]
know it's just personalities it doesn't interest me what you know what your

[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.780]
opinion is with me they're showing anything like that but talk back give some

[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.760]
information know what you're talking about do some homework I saw the Philadelphia

[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.100]
Montreal game last night it's entirety I saw the bees are going up some more

[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.260]
greasy goals and Philadelphia fold and which I love in the third period losing

[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:52.620]
four to one I saw that did you see it guilty here's a mobile implantation

[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.820]
hello yes sir yeah I don't know how anyone can listen to that show in the

[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.000]
morning anyway all they have is commercials on it yeah it's all spots radio

[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.460]
yeah it's it's awful yeah but can I change the subject what do you mean

[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.060]
change the subject we don't have a subject whatever you want is the subject okay

[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.760]
I'm not bored by it which I probably want to talk about the atkins died from

[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:18.840]
oh yeah can you tell me how it reduces cholesterol if you eat all that red meat

[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.580]
and dairy products I haven't got any idea sir that's like asking me how when

[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.320]
you put something in your mouth does it go through the intestine to the colon

[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.760]
and come out these you know rectum it just works so I talk asking when you have

[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.180]
a bad splitting headache and you take two aspirin do the doctors know how it

[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.920]
works no does anybody know how it really works no but you know so you can

[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.440]
either sit there and you know this is like the guy with a religion crap again

[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.120]
asking questions that we don't have answers for I don't know maybe even Bob

[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.460]
Atkins doesn't know it just so happens that for a lot of us it works like a

[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.220]
miracle so we don't ask any stupid questions in fact I'm getting a

[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.960]
screen you my great-just from here in him or from that helium one of the

[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:08.740]
other just just unbelievable these people don't ask too many questions okay

[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.700]
just like the Pope says don't ask any questions give us the guy day money and

[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:18.380]
stop asking the questions okay just do it like Nancy Reagan said or whoever

[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.500]
the hell said that the people would have Nike thing before the the guy see

[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.920]
even they got a swish on the for their logo what do you think of that all these

[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.080]
professional athletes running around with a swish on your thing I am I

[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.440]
wanted to have a purple little handbag but to have a swish on your thing yeah

[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.120]
that's what I mean just just like Al Goldstein told you believe me when I tell

[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.200]
you sports it's a gay club you moron once a guy showered together patting

[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.000]
each other on the ass it's a goddamn gay club so you can go you know fag fag

[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.040]
this great so what's the point fits right in here that's why they brought me

[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.920]
on this station they said what better the guys got big ratings a lot of

[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.760]
sponsors brings in a lot of money and he's a faggot he fits right in on a

[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:06.380]
sports station it's a fag thing and I said okay and here we are taking some

[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.060]
serious ass did that guy call by the way is he on there that guy won't call and

[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.140]
you know he's a listen right now call another show every time somebody calls a

[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.540]
show and what it wants to take you with something like well Hank said yes

[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.820]
that's out what do I always say call him up and talk to him about it

[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:30.540]
spineless jellyfish cowards I have no problem with default but default is

[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.180]
somewhat intimidated that's like laws or wait wait wait wait wait intimidated by

[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.680]
what Jeff what do you have that I'm intimidated by well I don't know you kind of

[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.300]
turn red when I come into studio why would I turn red when you come in here just

[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.340]
because I'm looking at a guy that's trying to warm his way under the show I'm not

[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.220]
warming my way I don't want your dog you know what this goes back let's clear

[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.980]
the air right now Jeff river yeah back at the aladreem's former radio station

[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.340]
when you came on the air on Neil Rogers show and trash virtually everybody that

[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.540]
worked at the station I got the feeling that you were sending a message to

[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.060]
Neil and trying to work your way around going through conventional systems

[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.600]
that about getting a job on the air that you were saying that I was sandbag in

[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.160]
your chances of getting on the radio that's what I kept hearing from people

[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.940]
that knew you personally and instead of saying it to me you're running around

[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.140]
saying oh well this deforestation is the reason I'm not getting a job that's not

[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:23.380]
true that's not true but anyway I want to move on you saying I'm jealous of

[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:28.080]
what you're doing and not saying what is that you're kind of showing say that no

[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.960]
I'm what I am saying though is this I just feel sometimes you kind of get a

[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.400]
little uncomfortable I'm intimidated by you who wouldn't be uncomfortable with a

[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.840]
guy that's trying to stab you in the back are you Aaron like this okay ten

[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.280]
fifteen and five sixty WQM did that guy call yet by the way the spineless sports

[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.160]
fan mr. macho what is big telephone stuck up his ass didn't call got a

[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.400]
strange your piece of mail fact it's only been back from vacation three days

[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.240]
already had some real bizarre mail here's the letter from Ann in Boiton Beach

[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:03.960]
and envelope and on the outside it's got a picture of it says L O V E or at least

[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.220]
it looks like that and of course I guess that's what it is because underneath

[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:13.540]
it says Jerry Steven 55 who skywrites messages above Volkerrton says God told

[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.480]
him to fill the sky with my word and that's Virgin Mary named his plane and

[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.700]
there it says love in the sky the sky writer is writing love in the sky so I

[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.620]
thought well this must be you know some cryptic anti-religious I open up the

[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:31.820]
envelope and inside with no writing or anything on it is an Easter card with a

[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.900]
picture of Jesus I assume that is it's either that or Charlton Heston with a

[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:41.220]
bad outfit as an Easter gift you and your intentions will remember during the

[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.620]
Easter octave of masses Easter Sunday to low Sunday to be celebrated in the

[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.160]
Holy Land made the blessings of the risen Christ remain with you always Jesus is

[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:57.580]
Lord and then it says Alalooia Christ is risen and on the bottom it says well

[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.760]
thank you so much and in Boiton Beach and May oh God bless you too sweetheart

[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.340]
Dusty Springfield is dead oh Christ cancer age of 60 I scoured my whole

[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.920]

[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.580]
again that was the one record that somebody must have held a gun to everybody's

[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.480]
head and said you got to record this in under two minutes because you could hear

[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.780]

this whole song of the dance about how much money she's gonna make an ABC is

[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.940]
walk into the bank all the ratings they're gonna get raising the spot rates up

[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:38.120]
for that barba wall wall interview tonight and they showed on CNN this morning I

[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.960]
think the polls are like sixty two percent of the public will not be watching

[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.640]
and thirty six percent that said they would now thirty six percent you got to

[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.400]
understand is a gigantic rating if that many people do watch it it's a humongous

[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.680]
raining but everything is relative so still the overwhelming majority of us

[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.200]
even if I weren't going to hockey game would I watch Monica tonight no I would

[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.660]
not watch that disgusting fat pig talking to that speech defected bitch all

[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:07.160]
and by the way speaking of bitch date line last night did you see that by any

[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.160]
chance story about the intercourse you know this is America with all the lawyers

[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.920]
we got people suing everybody eighteen-year-old girl sued Ma for parental

[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.360]
whatever the hell they call it cuz she a slafter and you know be there a

[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.740]
little bit cuz she stayed away for twenty four hours and came home the next day

[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.960]
and opened up a mouth and called her and called her something like that

[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.960]

[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.240]

Michigan right outside Detroit and the jury said not guilty let's get involved

[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.080]
into an important stuff let's bring oh Jay back for one more chance to fry his

[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.500]
ass and let's talk about something important but jica says how ironic that this

[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.680]
scandal will end with one last lie being exposed everyone is sick and tired of

[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.860]
this affair isn't this what you hear everywhere the ratings for tonight

[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.020]
special prove otherwise well again Tom what I'm trying to say to you is that at

[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.940]
least two thirds of us don't want to hear one more word about it but when you

[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.500]
got a tour to the people that are obsessed and they pointed out by the way

[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.000]
that the republicans in the CNN survey this morning the republicans are the

[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.840]
ones will be watching because they just can't get enough dirt they just

[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.400]
waiting to find out one more word and then of course we'll get into this rape

[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.720]
thing and then we'll find out that he's got a purple penis and it'll I mean

[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:30.540]
just there's no end to it the republican penis police that guy calling yet

[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:37.020]
by the way I did he rolled the whole goddamn thing I can't believe it

[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.100]
it's only the third of March and Greg Reed shows us face in the other room

[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:47.220]
didn't you tell him what I said yesterday he heard you third of March we got

[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.100]
three over three and a half years to go he shows up here and I give me a look

[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.660]
I've been having such a good time this week I've been in heaven come back in

[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.380]
this morning you get ripped by guilty first of all which is getting ripped a bit

[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.260]
like it's like getting ripped by a homeless bum under an overpass somewhere and

[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.900]
then Greg Reed comes in here looking like his usual cell here's a mobile

[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.520]
in hallowed ill hello

[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.680]
yes sir happy twenty third oh don't do that y'all you get upset about important

[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.400]
stuff

[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:25.700]
what did I watch tonight the hockey game or monica with the with the cigar action

[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:30.020]
forget about it yeah I'm gonna be at the hockey game so I really have no

[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:35.180]
options why do they keep saying this security's up to the game is out for the

[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.740]
season they don't even know what the hell they're talking about who said he's

[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.200]
out for the season where do you hear that I thought they were actually said on

[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.040]
the news last night I was watching the DSB and they said it got a sprain

[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.240]
the out for out for the definite wrong no not out for the season out indefinitely

[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.920]
means out for a few games they don't want to be back not out for the season

[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:58.860]
I'm gonna say okay get it right see see this is what goes on on this radio station

[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.120]
twenty hours a day people who think they know something about sports both the

[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.480]
ones on the air and the ones calling in uh... sharing this information with

[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:06.840]
each other

[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.320]
the old fairy is out for the season is the out no he's out with a sprain

[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.580]
that he got late in the game in the uh... uh... collar at all Edmonton game on

[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.100]
Monday night

[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.540]
sprained the he'll be out tonight and if you were watching last night which I'm

[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.680]
sure this guy was not on a small dish filling in Montreal Montreal is playing

[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.100]
Colorado or whatever game they got on next week Colorado and somebody and

[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.180]
they were saying whether the will be back for that game is still debatable

[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.600]
because he's out indefinitely meaning he'll be out there like pop out

[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.380]
burry was

[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.460]
it was not for the season but they didn't know exactly when he was going to be

[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.300]
back and it was a similar injury I guess

[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.700]
but these people calling on a station there isn't one percent of these people

[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.480]
who got any idea what they're talking about

[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.500]
if it's unbelievable

[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.780]
which is why you can have a punk like jelody on here that that that that that

[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.980]
that that that you know talking crap and they're just out there sucking it up

[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.540]
we can put a goddamn monkey like you know gorillas in the mist how do you like

[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.440]

[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.520]
even worse than the tv thing under pull on cnn this morning i think it was

[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.760]
like seventy nine or eighty percent of the people said

[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.800]
no way they would not buy the book why would anybody invest money to read

[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.700]
to hear the same crap all over again from this slot

[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.900]

[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.120]
can't stand that

from

[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:37.880]

The time is here.

[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.440]
When the time is here,

[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.400]

[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.280]

just getting mud for the duck.

[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.320]
Boys of the rainbow,

[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.720]
we just get in that time.

[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.540]
White man has a heart.

[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:56.900]
His friend,

[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.020]
he's the Gamer,

[00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.160]
the man,

[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:00.240]
the man,

[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.820]
the old B-tiddle.

[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.160]
When they find out he's been

[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.180]
sick strickel,

[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.400]
watch your face away.

[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.100]
I'm down the board,

[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.080]
you're gay.

[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.380]
Jordan and gay.

[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.500]
Who's there?

[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.760]
Jordan and gay.

[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.220]
Where?

[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.380]
Yes.

[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.760]
You know the reason,

[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.300]
that laughter can look too bad.

[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.640]
As the baby stands above,

[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.640]
and it sucks just like a hoover.

[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.340]
It's been over for a guy

[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.480]
company's head.

[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.300]
It's been that he likes to home.

[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.300]
He's racing out the home with

[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.740]
fashion and so he's looking at

[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.680]
him wearing red puffs.

[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.540]
The fans won't be dimpled

[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.920]
when they find out he's been

[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.000]
sick strickel,

[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.080]
watch your face away.

[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.480]
Oh, a massive board is gay.

[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.580]
Oh my god.

[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.040]
Jordan and gay.

[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:21.880]
Who's there?

[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.400]
Jordan and gay.

[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.060]
Don't touch me there.

[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.120]
It's living.

[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.340]
century three is last,

[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.460]
50-22 am.

[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.020]
The rest of you are dead.

[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.220]
We're doing good now.

[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.440]
I hope he's going to walk in the

[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:37.660]
middle.

[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.140]
The drags and drags.

[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.580]
That's especially for that

[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:46.580]
pose that I called it

[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.160]
a fucking golden hat this morning

[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:48.820]
and morning show.

[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.740]
Radio, the catalyst for the

[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.380]
flag, radio and drag hobby

[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.180]
documents in.

[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.460]
Hey, is this from radio

[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.220]
and records today?

[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.540]
Just handed to me by Greg Reed

[00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.840]
who came down and spoiled my day.

[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.140]
Doug Greaseman,

[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.560]
track lots is because I saw him.

[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.260]
Doug Greaseman, track will hold a

[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.220]
press conference at the downtown

[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.420]
Washington Church today to

[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.960]
apologize and express his

[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.840]
humility spokesman,

[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.780]
Rock Newman, told R&R today.

[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.040]
Track was fired from

[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.260]
Infinity Classic Rocker,

[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.560]
WARFM last week for an

[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.100]
on air racist remark associated

[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.560]
with the dragging death of a

[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.440]
black man in Texas.

[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.680]
Newman said, track wants to use

[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.980]
this opportunity to become a

[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.620]
better person and that his

[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.400]
desire to get another job is

[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.080]
secondary.

[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:28.860]
Right.

[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.360]
Who wants to use this

[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.940]
opportunity to suck up to

[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:32.320]
those dark,

[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.380]
complex folks in Washington

[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.240]
and said, I didn't really

[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.120]
need it anymore than I

[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.560]
made that comment about Martin

[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.180]
Luther Coon Day or whatever

[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:38.760]
it was he said.

[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.680]
Which brings us back to that

[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.020]
story in Uganda by the way.

[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.360]
I mean, what does it say

[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:44.840]
about that?

[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.580]
And of course, hundreds of

[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:47.400]
thousands, I mean this

[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.420]
particular group of

[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.980]
rebels as they call them.

[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:50.820]
That's a nice word.

[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.400]
Lunatics, Stone Age barbarians,

[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.880]
hundreds of thousands of

[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.700]
their countrymen have been

[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:56.620]
killing each other for

[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.680]
the last couple of years.

[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:57.820]
And I think that's why they

[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:58.460]
are not just, they're

[00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.040]
different tribes.

[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.840]
Oh, I noticed they did not

[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.720]
do the icky shuffle.

[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.220]
Did you see any of that footage

[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.000]
with the Atootsie?

[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.060]
When they were playing

[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.040]
bi-bi-tootsie, goodbye?

[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:09.520]
And they were shaking their

[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:09.760]
booty.

[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:10.700]
Rams with Tootsie?

[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.440]
Yeah, they were shaking that

[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:12.840]
little line.

[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.280]
So maybe it's a cultural

[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:14.540]
thing.

[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.280]
I don't know what that's all

[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:15.480]
about.

[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.680]
Why does anybody, why does

[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.680]
any person in its right mind

[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.280]
go to Africa to go to the

[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.380]
rainforest, to go on these

[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.720]
safaris, or what do they

[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.320]
go there for?

[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.100]
To see the gorillas.

[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:31.380]
Here's Weston.

[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:31.580]
Hello.

[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.600]
You better go to church

[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.240]
and apologize.

[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:33.920]
Hey, Nail.

[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:34.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.860]
Yeah, you don't have to go to

[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.140]
Africa to see the gorillas.

[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:37.460]
Yeah.

[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.320]
Let me, I need to get your

[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.500]
personal opinion on a problem

[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.180]
on having to work.

[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:42.820]
Just remember what happened to

[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.660]
Howard Coastel, man.

[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.240]
I know. Well, I'm not on

[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.400]
any position where they can,

[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.360]
you know, fire me for.

[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:47.960]
How much I'm not working

[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.320]
around.

[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.060]
I'm not working.

[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:49.960]
So now the garrison.

[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.560]
I have this guy,

[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.560]
well, I should I am working

[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.680]
on this B.S. thing about that.

[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:55.460]
There's a guy that sits

[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:56.440]
in front of me at work.

[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:56.920]
Yeah.

[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.920]
It's got to be 400 pounds on,

[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.700]
like on a light day.

[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:01.380]
Right.

[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.920]
He wears these white shorts

[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.560]
about every day of the week.

[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.340]
Yeah.

[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:07.720]
They got it.

[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:08.500]
They're not the cover.

[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.880]
I would say Joe Robby stayed

[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.480]
in easy.

[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:11.760]
Okay. They're huge.

[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:12.740]
Where's a pupton?

[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:13.900]
He sits in front of me.

[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.680]
Yeah, when you're that big

[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.460]
because I know about that.

[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.160]
You wear a pupton.

[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.080]
Let me tell you what he does.

[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.500]
And if I hope you haven't had a

[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.000]
big breakfast.

[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:20.380]
He.

[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:21.480]
Yeah.

[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.560]
He leans over his desk

[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.600]
and gives me a shot of that big

[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.560]
carcass of his.

[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.240]
And he's got a little brown spot.

[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.080]
And he's got a different spot.

[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.240]
You've got to understand that when you're that fat

[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.460]
and believe me, I've never been, you know,

[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.680]
400 pounds, but I've been real fat at times.

[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.760]
When you're that fat,

[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.760]
you do a lot of seeping.

[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.640]
I mean, that's the most,

[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.700]
yeah, because I'm

[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.220]
I think you go on a sinker.

[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.140]
Because that's it.

[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:44.540]
What do you think?

[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.500]
Do you think I should tell him?

[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.380]
Tell him what.

[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.440]
Well, you got crap on your ass

[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.420]
or something like that.

[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.020]
Well, where else would you expect to have it?

[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:52.680]
Oh, it's on the hair.

[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:53.980]
It's better than being like

[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.340]
a guilty and having it on your tongue.

[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.000]
We have an open line of day two

[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.740]
and Howard five six seven oh five six

[00:28:59.740 --> 00:28:59.860]
six.

[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.140]
Why do you think they call that guy

[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:01.840]
B M anyway?

[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:02.360]
Huh?

[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:04.400]
That's what they call him.

[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.220]
See, I'd like like I said before,

[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:07.920]
if you're going to,

[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.160]
if you're going to take shot,

[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.800]
at least get your information right,

[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.660]
guilty, at least know what you're talking about.

[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.380]
And then Greg Reed comes down here and says to me,

[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.800]
oh, that was good radio this morning.

[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.740]
That was great radio.

[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.520]
The big controversy between me and guilty.

[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.320]
That's great radio.

[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:23.740]
Yeah.

[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.500]
Look at you already strangling himself

[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.860]
with his goddamn headset cord.

[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.360]
That was great radio.

[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:29.960]
See that?

[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:30.940]
And he means it.

[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.640]
He believes it.

[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.560]
That's the best part.

[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.960]
He believes that Geldy belongs on the ear.

[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:37.660]
Here's Miami.

[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.000]
Hello.

[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.240]
Hey, Neil.

[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:39.640]
How you doing?

[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.120]
Okay, sir.

[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.340]
I really enjoy your show at first time,

[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:42.760]
caller.

[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:43.360]
All right.

[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.220]
And the worst thing is the worst team.

[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.720]
And I'll tell you that Geldy is good.

[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.840]
That Geldy is so paranoid and so thin skin to get.

[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.300]
So insecure, that deep hole.

[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.440]
And he's got those cushes, but the guy really knows.

[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.180]
You learn nothing about sports on that radio show.

[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.300]
You know, they just blabber and blabber Joe Rose

[00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.480]
with the social life.

[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:00.920]
Geldy, Mr.

[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.080]
Yeah, Joe, Joe wants it all.

[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.680]
You know, if all these guys are getting in, you know,

[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.060]
how they do with the ladies, the ladies that business.

[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.720]
It's just a little ponderous.

[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.460]
Yeah, but I have a thing that when a grease man takes over

[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.160]
mornings here in a couple of weeks, because that's why Greg

[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.640]
really came down here to give me the news.

[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.160]
I wasn't supposed to be.

[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.460]
I love when he knocked on Geldy, because he's a young punk trying to make a name

[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.780]
and I've always thought he'd be.

[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.260]
There are young guys in sports like Bug.

[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.240]
I mean, he's a much too fat, but Bug at least is a broadcaster.

[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.080]
He usually knows what he's talking about.

[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.220]
And now that they separated him at the hip from Christina Moore

[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.860]
and they got the two away from each other,

[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.120]
now Bug is developing into like a real talent.

[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:38.060]
But Geldy is between the voice and the suction factor.

[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.100]
There's nothing there.

[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.120]
Yeah, since when does he, Joe Hockey?

[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.720]
Now, I see him on Wyoming now.

[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:43.380]
Yeah.

[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.240]
Well, I mean, why don't you get on there?

[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.360]
He's 23 years old.

[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:47.900]
He was around.

[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.800]
Because he's a suckle.

[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.600]
He's on the payroll of the organization.

[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.420]
Just like the stuff you read in the newspapers,

[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.240]
like yesterday, more than they're quoting Robbie Niedermar.

[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.500]
Oh, well, we got to do this.

[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.160]
And we got to do that.

[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.100]
Here's the guy that never played one full game, 60 minutes,

[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.220]
in his entire career with this organization.

[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.380]
And they're always taking quotes from him about what they got to do this

[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.060]
and they got to do that.

[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.600]
When is he going to start doing that?

[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.760]
He's a guy who's got a dogman.

[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.700]
And he's got a town, but he's got no heart.

[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.000]
Right.

[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:11.640]
There you go.

[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.020]
So why are they always quoting him, though?

[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.120]
Yeah, Lindsey's got all heart, but he's got zero talent.

[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.340]
Probably because he's the only one on a team that'll talk to that fat microsoil anymore.

[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.840]
Yeah, I love your show, Neil, and keep knocking Geldy.

[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.580]
And have a great day.

[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:23.320]
That voice, man.

[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.120]
Okay, see you.

[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:24.820]
Goodbye.

[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.240]
All the nice days.

[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.100]
Two open lines and Broward.

[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:29.860]
I'm going to, you know, something.

[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.740]
I think I'm going to do it the rest of the year.

[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:32.700]
I'm going to do in that voice.

[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.060]
If he can do it, why not?

[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:35.820]
Can I do it?

[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.580]
Two open lines and Broward, five, six, seven, oh five, 60.

[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.060]
And pound five, 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:43.440]
Come on.

[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.160]
Let's hear it.

[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.020]
I have fired up and pitched off for tonight's game or what?

[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:48.180]
No.

[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.100]
I mean, if he can do what, how can't we?

[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.200]
We...

[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.740]
Slushing down, my dad, or what?

[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:01.320]
From the people that brought you, maybe last, it's a brand new exciting game show on pornography central.

[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.440]
Make me come.

[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.520]
And here's your host, Dean's Mountain Dan.

[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.580]
Hello, you know, and what's more than purpose on your host, Dave Mountain Dan.

[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:14.540]
Today we're going to find out whether our four stars can make Rebecca of Donnie Brooks farm come.

[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:21.220]
If not going to be easy because Rebecca informed us earlier that she's only had sex with farm animals.

[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.040]
Round baby kin, let's meet off our four stars.

[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.140]
Wilk the still.

[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:27.940]
Wow, it's just Maui.

[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.380]
I get that's what they need by big foot.

[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.900]
Anyway, Wilk the still.

[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.480]
Rebecca of Donnie Brooks says, make me come.

[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.400]
This is Maui, maybe some of time.

[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.960]
Oh, Mr. Ed, Mr. Ed.

[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:42.420]
Oh!

[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:44.740]
Yeah!

[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.580]
I don't believe it.

[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.320]
Rebecca, you sure you're not a guy.

[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.180]
It only suits you.

[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.640]
Eleven seconds, the jump.

[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.460]
Oh, it's down to you, Dave.

[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.600]
Take me, we want to get that firewall over here.

[00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:01.900]
Make me come only on pornography central to an in-next week for celebrity guest, our Monica Lewinsky.

[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.260]
Oh, you can do it in the night.

[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.420]
You'll be watching.

[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.100]
Most of you will be watching that crack tonight.

[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:06.840]
You don't want to admit it.

[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:07.200]
You'll be watching.

[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.300]
You'll be peeking out of the corner.

[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.200]
I'm 10.45.

[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.540]
You know, the one thing I would like to know before this day is out, what are we going to do about these gorillas in our midst?

[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.940]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.260]
Hello.

[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:20.740]
Good morning.

[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.300]
Yes sir.

yeah, I'd go with the number 10,

[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.180]
on the map with the number six,

[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:24.600]
after 2615 and add sull if it's educational then I'm going to get that.

[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:24.600]

[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:28.780]
I'm going to get him at 76 and generate down just one XML patch.

[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:28.940]
Three be throughout random and installed drive x graduates.

[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:28.940]

[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.000]
two thanking Инse journey.

[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.880]
Because if I started in on the way I feel about doctors today, I would go till midnight,

[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.520]
nonstop.

[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.420]
I'd never take a breath.

[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.740]
In fact, most of you could go to one of doctors, they'll make sure you'll never take

[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:41.280]
another breath.

[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.040]
Here's Hollywood, hello.

[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.480]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:46.120]
Okay, sir.

[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:50.240]
Uh, a grease man used to be on a radio station here in Florida.

[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:50.960]
Did he really?

[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.540]
Yeah, he was on with the Hick as a one-up injection bill.

[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.380]
Oh, that's right.

[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.000]
The eighth.

[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:56.720]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:57.220]
Yeah.

[00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.640]
Yeah, he was, he was grosser than he is now.

[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.380]
I don't see what the big deal is.

[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.280]
I don't get it.

[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.180]
They just got a real bunch of sensitive dark people up there in Washington, I guess, for

[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:07.820]
those sensitive humor.

[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:09.680]
Hey, I got a question for you.

[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:17.500]
Why do these people that own these commercial accounts do their own voiceovers or whatever

[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.300]
you want to call them?

[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.340]
One word.

[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:19.920]
Ego.

[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.160]
Is that what it is?

[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:21.300]
Yeah.

[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.140]
Because they sound like El Dorco.

[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:23.640]
Right.

[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:24.200]
Ego.

[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.440]
Okay, you take care.

[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:26.160]
Okay, you too.

[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.340]
Yeah, he's right.

[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.620]
A lot of people insist on doing their own spots.

[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:33.900]
We got many of those people here in town like, like King Paul.

[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.240]
Isn't King Paul dead, by the way?

[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:41.600]
Because I see those TV spots and his, uh, kin, his daughter and the husband, whatever they

[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.300]
are doing the spot.

[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.660]
And actually, some of those spots are kind of cute, even though they look real dorky,

[00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:47.600]
just like King Paul, the glasses and the whole deal.

[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.280]
But there are just some people like that.

[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.540]
They really don't care whether they're doing any business from that.

[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.000]
It's just like Martin King.

[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:53.820]
There's a guy.

[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.120]
They don't advertise on his station.

[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.840]
Martin King and Scott King from King, whatever it is, they pedal.

[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.840]
You know, kind of, uh, Martin, I'm a Martin King.

[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.000]
Well, Martin, you know, you get a personality transplant.

[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:06.840]
You're very stiff.

[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:07.940]
You're very stilted.

[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.360]
Your delivery is a bad.

[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.200]
But we do know who you are.

[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:13.540]
You know something.

[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:14.780]
I think it is in this room again.

[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.420]
I think I'm, oh, man, I'm having a bad, you know something.

[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:21.700]
It just started after Greg Reed came down here and all of a sudden, I'm all like choked

[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.260]
up and gagging on stuff in here.

[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.580]
It's in this place.

[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.860]
Here's a mobile in Bokeh.

[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:28.860]

[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:29.600]
Hey, Neil.

[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:30.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.100]
I got a question for you.

[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.060]
What, um, what happened to your website?

[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.280]
What happened to what website?

[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:37.800]
The Neil dot Neil.

[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.240]
That's that ancient history.

[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.440]
It's Neil Rogers dot com.

[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.020]
You got to get with the, with the, with the country.

[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:42.880]
Oh, man, no wonder.

[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.300]
We're almost at the end of the century.

[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.080]
You're still like 200 years behind.

[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.720]
Neil Rogers dot com.

[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.480]
Eric and Orlando does a great job on it.

[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:50.080]
Okay.

[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:50.700]
I'll check that out.

[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.340]
Hey, I'm riding around with a coworker of mine.

[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.900]
And he's here.

[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.280]
He's laughing.

[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:57.320]
Yeah.

[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:05.580]
And he wants, he's, well, I would tell him about, yeah, I was telling him about lotion

[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.200]
in the basket.

[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.140]
He wants to hear that.

[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:08.520]
Is there any way you can play it?

[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.040]
Any way I can play with the whole thing?

[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.400]
Yeah, please.

[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.720]
So how about just it puts the lotion in the basket for starters in the rest of it later.

[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:16.520]
Okay.

[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:16.940]
Thank you.

[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:17.620]
Good.

[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:21.920]
I got this guy in the, actually, he's in the trunk of my car.

[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:22.440]
I kidnath.

[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.880]
I mean, he's sure like poison, but I got the speakers blurring so we can't miss hearing

[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.140]
it.

[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.040]
And I got him locked up in the trunk and he wants to hear something like it puts the lotion

[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.040]
in the basket.

[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.180]
Look at to it.

[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.380]
Oh, there's something bad in this place.

[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:39.340]
There is or maybe, and you know something Greg Reed told me his kids got monol.

[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:41.760]
And he hasn't been feeling too good.

[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.320]
And he sure don't want to spread it around.

[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.100]
He was in here like half an hour ago.

[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.000]
And I'm already like choked up and I'm jagging.

[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.080]
Was I doing this before he came in?

[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:51.020]
No.

[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.320]
No, shouldn't let him lick your face like that.

[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.760]
Oh, that was my face.

[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.460]
Toby, I'm about to fall.

[00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:58.120]

[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.680]
This is Debbie.

[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:02.640]
Hello, hi, Debbie.

[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.300]
I'm interested in getting through operations done.

[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.080]
Okay.

[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.440]
And some body contouring and some lip oil extraction.

[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.040]
Uh-huh.

[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.460]
And I was wondering if it's some tummy tuck and lip augmentation cosmetic.

[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:16.360]
The best surgery place for all of these things.

[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:16.840]
Uh-huh.

[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:18.040]
And I was wondering.

[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.200]
Well, let's start with.

[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:21.680]
Well, I need to get everything done.

[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:26.120]
Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my thing.

[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:27.680]
Okay, we don't do that.

[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:28.160]
No.

[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.060]
Could you do breast implants though?

[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.180]
Uh, I can't be done.

[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.700]
But I don't know if they would do it right away.

[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.640]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:36.480]
Uh-huh.

[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:37.760]
How much?

[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.300]
Uh, 5,000.

[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:40.020]
Excellent.

[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:42.440]
I'd like to have my skin resurfaced too.

[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.180]
Uh-huh.

[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.240]
Lace of surgery.

[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.040]
Uh-huh.

[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.160]
Have the lamb stop crying yet, mommy?

[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.460]
Excuse me?

[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.380]
Don't hurt mommy's little baby.

[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.900]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.660]
I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV.

[00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:58.560]
Okay.

[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.820]
Can you make me look more like a woman?

[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.340]
Well, we'll have to see you first.

[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.500]
And then I'm on looking actually.

[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.740]
We can tell you that when we see you.

[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:08.820]
Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts, mommy?

[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.600]
Uh, if you'd like to.

[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.880]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.240]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:15.400]
Yes.

[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:16.200]
Okay.

[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.000]
Um, there is a $100 consultation fee.

[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:19.880]
That's fine.

[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:22.100]
Okay.

[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:23.740]
Okay.

[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.720]
Um, my name is Buffalo Bill.

[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:27.440]
Okay.

[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.760]
Let me give you a little information from you.

[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.060]
Okay.

[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:32.220]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.240]
I understand.

[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.780]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.040]
Do you want to come in for a consultation for the life of the...

[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.940]
What's the lotion in the basket?

[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:43.060]
Uh, okay.

[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.180]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.140]
Or do you want to call me back?

[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.160]
Okay, what's the lotion in the basket?

[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:48.780]
I understand.

[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.420]
I got my skin suit and it was like, uh...

[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:55.700]
Bill, it puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:56.960]
I understand that.

[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.520]
What's the lotion in the basket?

[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.220]
What's the lotion in the basket?

[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.020]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:04.020]

[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.320]
I will talk to you in a time, okay?

[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.260]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:08.040]
Hello?

[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.000]
11.03 at 5.60.

[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.820]
And we got hanged from the Durala to a clock.

[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.600]
Booster from the National Car Eating Center at 6.

[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.400]
And then 7 o'clock to pregame.

[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.700]
Panthers in Colorado at night.

[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:19.200]
7.30.

[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:19.720]
Any interest?

[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:20.000]
No.

[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:20.300]
Okay.

[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:25.860]
You know, just above the story about the grease man going to church today to try to save his ass.

[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.060]
And it's R&R today thing.

[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:29.660]
This story is...

[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:34.160]
And coincidentally, the guy that just called you before about the grease man used to be on the ape in Jacksonville.

[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:35.280]
Wait till you're this story.

[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.040]
It says no more monkey business.

[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:48.200]
WPLA Jacksonville Nighttimer, Dick Dale, wanted to one up Crosstown WAP, which was doing a cash call contest called Spank the Monkies.

[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.380]
WAP is known as the Big Ape.

[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.420]
So last week he created his own contest of the same name.

[00:46:53.920 --> 00:47:01.700]
The difference, Dale's version involved male listeners who competed in the studio to see who could not be masters of their domain in the quickest time.

[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:08.820]
WPLA even recruited two female volunteers to serve as visual stimuli for the contestants.

[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:13.400]
In keeping with the theme, the contest ended prematurely, Scorch-Court.

[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:14.720]
Not that way.

[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:21.400]
When one of the 14 contestants who just happened to be an undercover vice cop busted Dale on a prostitution statute.

[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:26.820]
Program director Rick Schmidt was suspended and Dale went on vacation until Monday when both will return.

[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.380]
A little premature Scorch-Court evacuation.

[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:32.400]
How do you like that?

[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.680]
This is the kind of stuff that's going on in radio in America today.

[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.980]
His guys are coming in and speccing their monkey and they're bringing naked bras and it kind of sounds like the old Ron and Ron show.

[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.500]
Of course, in that case it was the host that we're doing it.

[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.960]
See, I'm still trying to figure that out.

[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.960]
I know it's not very complicated, but they used to bring in these skanky naked bras.

[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.900]
I mean, Scabby, you wouldn't touch him with somebody else's.

[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:57.180]
Okay, believe me.

[00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:01.660]
No matter how desperate you are, even the thing wouldn't touch them with his thing.

[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:07.720]
And I used to go in there in the other in the control room and I'd look in there and hear Ron and Ron and Feds.

[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:09.020]
Of course, it was all red in the push.

[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.560]
I think it was a face.

[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:16.040]
And they're sitting in the way these naked bras I'm thinking it's a radio show.

[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.360]
They really don't have to be naked.

[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:21.140]
You follow what I'm saying?

[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.220]
It's just a radio show.

[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.200]
Nobody can see it.

[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.600]
You're naked right now.

[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:31.200]
And in that case, the more close they would have put on, the more appealing it would have been because they were skanky.

[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:32.560]
I mean Scabby.

[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.400]
Even Scabby Hayes never looked like that.

[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.320]
Here's Miami.

[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:38.660]
Hello.

[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.820]
Hey, Neil. How are you doing?

[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:41.320]
Okay.

[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:46.780]
Hey, Neil, about that guy with the crap stain on him.

[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.100]
Yeah.

[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.320]
Three, two.

[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.120]
Open line of day two and groward.

[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.540]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty.

[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:57.440]
One of yours is pound five, sixty on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:58.240]
Like I told you.

[00:48:58.800 --> 00:48:59.420]
Oh, look at this.

[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.100]
We got the Mickey work lady on here. Hello.

[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:02.760]
Hello.

[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:04.320]
Yes, this is the Mickey work lady.

[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.760]
No, I love to know.

[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:06.980]
I just test that man.

[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.760]
He is the lowest comeback in the world.

[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.460]
Why are you saying that?

[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:11.680]
Because you're the Mickey work lady.

[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.400]
Well, we love you.

[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.180]
We love you when we insult the charm of the world.

[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.180]
Well, do you want to say this?

[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:17.800]
The Mickey work lady.

[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.480]
Why I'm calling.

[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:19.320]
Why are you calling?

[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.000]
The thing is, because.

[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.060]
You weren't talking to me this way.

[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:25.720]
You were like saying, you were a reporter saying reality.

[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.540]
You were like a litmus test for the same.

[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:29.740]
And the people can understand your show.

[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.120]
They're the same, that's all.

[00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:32.040]
You know that?

[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.040]
Oh, and Mickey work lady.

[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:35.660]
Yeah, no.

[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:39.200]
Yeah, yeah, that's the Mickey work lady who's the little under the weather this morning.

[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:40.380]
Yeah.

[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:42.240]
You're not going to put me on this.

[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.100]
I'm going to say, I'm listening.

[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:44.240]
You're not going to put me on this.

[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:44.360]

[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.200]
I'm not going to put you on this.

[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.900]
What do you mean I'm not going to put you on this.

[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:51.640]
Well, I'm sorry to tell you how you're touching people out there.

[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:52.340]
Yeah.

[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.600]
Not many, but the water is touching people.

[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.460]
Not enough.

[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.140]
I'll tell you that.

[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:55.860]
Not the right one.

[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:59.180]
Well, that's because they're dead, brain dead, on in the head.

[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:00.560]
I love your show.

[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.660]
I love you.

[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:01.780]

[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.520]
Say how to Mickey.

[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:02.840]
Okay.

[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.740]
We have an open line in the day 2 and Broward.

[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:10.100]
56670560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:11.840]
In fact, now we got like 8,000 open lines.

[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:13.960]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:14.160]
Hello.

[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:15.260]
Bill.

[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:15.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:16.620]
All right.

[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.920]
I just want to tell you that let's notice the distance between hip hop and rap music.

[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:22.060]
Which is what?

[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:23.920]
Hip hop is the culture.

[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.620]
And the rap music just moves about.

[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.340]
Hip hop is the culture.

[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:28.780]
Yeah.

[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.880]
That's the way you live, the way you dress, the way you know, the way you carry yourself.

[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:37.720]
The rap music just retains, I don't like all rap music, but I'm in the hip hop.

[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.540]
You don't like rap music but you're in the hip hop.

[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:43.140]
Oh, I saddle my all rap music.

[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:43.500]
Yeah.

[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.200]
But I live hip hop.

[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.440]
You live hip hop.

[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:46.760]
Right.

[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:47.640]
Which means.

[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:51.000]
Just like you get, you don't walk around gay or they, you know.

[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:51.920]
Oh yeah, you know.

[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:53.040]
I'm minced.

[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.780]
You know, you put on pants, you don't walk around like a lady.

[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:56.200]
Oh, sure.

[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:57.880]
I got like pantalooning on right now.

[00:50:58.300 --> 00:50:59.540]
You run the sand on the sand.

[00:50:59.540 --> 00:50:59.880]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.260]
In fact, I'm sitting here stark naked.

[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.680]
Yeah, I just want to let you know because the tour is on the way to talking about it.

[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.480]
Okay, well listen, hop on this and have a good life.

[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:08.880]
All right.

[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:09.920]
Okay, he likes to hit.

[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:14.260]
See, I don't, I don't, I mean, I'm not finding that explanation because they call the music now hip hop.

[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:17.580]
If hip hop, be a way of life, then how can it be hip hop music?

[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.680]
You be following what I'm saying?

[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.500]
And I was thinking the other day because there was a pickup truck.

[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:26.820]
I was sitting in a stop light with two, an ugly kind of red neck of your white kids sitting in it.

[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:27.760]
Blasting the music.

[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.500]
And of course they had that rap music on that real.

[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.800]
Just here on a tolerated crap.

[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:37.320]
And I was thinking what a shame, you know, because now it's like all the way up to say like early 30s.

[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:41.560]
Would that be about the right age to say that all those young people grew up listening to a rap crap.

[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:45.440]
And then they consider that their music, which I think is.

[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.080]
I mean embarrassing would be an understanding.

[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.980]
Would you even admit that you like that music?

[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:50.760]
Anybody out there?

[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:51.020]
No.

[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:53.720]
No, I mean, if you were white, would you admit that you like that?

[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:53.900]
No.

[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:54.180]
No.

[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:58.640]
I mean, if you were black, you're supposed to be like this guy, although he said he don't like all of that.

[00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.500]
That is what he said.

[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:00.860]
But he lives hip hop.

[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.020]
Kind of like the Easter Bunny.

[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.120]
He lives hip hop.

[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.720]
He's hopping on it every time he can.

[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:09.940]
Now if somebody would teach those folks a little bit about birth control, we'd all get along.

[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:10.620]
Do Jay.

[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.940]
Exactly him too.

[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:19.120]
We have an open line in the Bronx in two and a five six seven, oh five sixty.

[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.260]
Oh, that's you be ill and is that what that was?

[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:22.960]
Sure.

[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.400]
Let's hear it.

[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.040]
You'll Jay.

[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:26.960]
Wait, yeah.

[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.060]
Oh, yeah.

[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.160]
You'll be ill and maybe.

[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.520]
Okay, put it on this suspended animation.

[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.020]
Hold it.

[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.160]
Yes, first.

[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:37.660]
Back to the moon.

[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:43.380]
Have you ever had the run?

[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:47.380]
And baby, come notice the Hershey square.

[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:52.640]
Oh, now the golden under the sea.

[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.300]
The kind that makes your eyes really scream.

[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:04.700]
You do the green at the quick steps that when you try to hold it in it starts there to run.

[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:11.360]
Where she twerps the healing and dying the rear splatter falls.

[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.480]
Yeah, that God works in mysterious ways, doesn't it?

[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.960]
I mean, what kind of God would create diarrhea?

[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:19.260]
Constipation.

[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.020]
I've asked you this question many times before.

[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.540]
Does anybody ever have an answer?

[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:22.860]
No.

[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:26.560]
Even animals, even your dog.

[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:27.800]
Of course you got him on a human diet.

[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:28.980]
You know, that's going to be the excuse.

[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.380]
Even dogs get the squirts, hopefully not in the house too often.

[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:34.520]
Thank you Chuck.

[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:39.340]
There's my buddy Chuck from the sub-setters bringing me my last meal before I croak from whatever this.

[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:40.940]
And I just said the George during the break.

[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:44.180]
I said, I've got this like like twitch in the eyelid or my left eye,

[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:45.860]
along with all this other stuff that's going on.

[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.820]
He said, yeah, I've had that for the last few days too.

[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.260]
Now isn't that interesting?

[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.060]
I go away from here for 10 days.

[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:53.500]
Feeling pretty good.

[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.780]
Feeling anything I could, okay?

[00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:00.800]
And this rash, you know, going pretty much away and making a little bit of a comeback, but not too bad.

[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:01.940]
Come back here.

[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.380]
It's the third day back to work.

[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.760]
My eye is twitching.

[00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:06.360]
I feel like I'm on death's door.

[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.560]
My head is aching.

[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.560]
My rash is like palpitating.

[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:11.260]
My recto.

[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:12.360]
I feel too great either.

[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:18.300]
You don't think there could be like something in this place like a real sick place, do you?

[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:18.660]
Uh-huh.

[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:22.940]
Because God forbid they should have to actually spend some money and clean this, put, and join out.

[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.240]
When it doubt, clean that, join out.

[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:27.480]
By the way, here's a facts from money inside and third channel.

[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:29.740]
They hate, they all hate each other over there.

[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.700]
Can't think it along like we do here.

[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:39.140]
This fact says Peter Boulder would sell his children and wife for a permanent sucking spot on Rana's rectums.

[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:42.120]
What it's a little fast, but you know, how do you like that?

[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:43.180]
And that's true.

[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:44.680]
How do you sleep?

[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.360]
How do you live with yourself, Peter Boulder?

[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:48.320]
All the lives you've destroyed in this market.

[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:50.460]
How do you like it?

[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:53.080]
Even at the slaughterhouse over there in Chicago.

[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:57.180]
They don't destroy as many lives as you're doing in this business.

[00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:59.520]
You piece of walking turd.

[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.160]
Garbage.

[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.300]
Garbage on two legs.

[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.420]
That's you, Pete Boulder.

[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:09.120]
And of course, you know, Tom Jik is busy writing about Monica Lewinsky, denied, and about how she's really going to have a big deal.

[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:14.040]
And that's a big audience in spite of the fact that, you know, Tom, why don't you write ever about anything that's going on in this town?

[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:19.660]
We got all of these things, all of this, the buttery going on in the media in this town.

[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:22.420]
And you're busy, always Mr. Network expert, you know?

[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:23.180]
All of these things.

[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:24.400]
Yeah, that's what we want to read about.

[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.780]
We don't give a crap about everybody and their brother knows that bitch is going to be on there.

[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:32.740]
With that illiterate, with that speech defective piece of garbage from Miami Beach, Bob Waw.

[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:34.720]
See, that's the scandal.

[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.800]
Not that Monica Lewinsky is going to be on there.

[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.860]
But that Bob was doing it and that, you know what?

[00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:40.300]
She's the guilty of TV.

[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.440]
I see a tremendous parallel.

[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:44.920]
She can't speak.

[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.740]
She cannot speak at all.

[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:51.240]
Tom Broca and Barbara Walters are the gildies of television.

[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.820]
They can't speak even a little bit.

[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:59.440]
And somebody somewhere decided that they were sensational and worth millions of dollars to put their ass on there.

[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.940]
It is absolutely unbelievable.

[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:08.720]
Okay, deadlines open 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:13.600]
And by the way, Geldy, to talk about what a hard ass and little piece of tour you are,

[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:18.720]
while virtually everybody else in the building came down and said happy 23rd anniversary, Neil, on Monday,

[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:21.200]
including those people that hate me like poison some of them.

[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:24.120]
Did he come down here and show his little ugly face?

[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:24.400]
No.

[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:25.320]
Not that I really care.

[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:27.920]
But just to show you what little hard ass he is.

[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.740]
And he's knocking me in Hank.

[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:33.140]
Oh my god.

[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:35.340]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:35.700]
Hello.

[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:37.120]
Hello, Neil.

[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:38.400]
I don't think we'll ever be this in again.

[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:38.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.160]
There's this place out on Miami Beach.

[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:42.940]
It's called the Sandbar.

[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:43.920]
Out on 60 something.

[00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:45.300]
Collins.

[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:45.780]
Yeah.

[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.420]
There's a guy out there who flips burgers, speaking of diarrhea.

[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.460]
It looks just like you.

[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:54.300]
And.

[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:57.520]
And kind of funny.

[00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:58.360]
You should go check him out.

[00:56:58.620 --> 00:56:59.800]
Be like looking in the mirror.

[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:00.480]
Yeah.

[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:02.340]
Okay.

[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.080]
Thanks for the good news.

[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:03.980]
Oh my god.

[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.140]
This guy waited all that time for something that profound.

[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:06.740]
Thank you.

[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.020]
He discovered your other job.

[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:08.680]
He what?

[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.220]
He just discovered your other job.

[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:11.200]
Yeah.

[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.020]
I was trying to keep it under covers.

[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:15.640]
We were going to think I make all the big bucks.

[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:16.960]
You're not from this tea pass outfit.

[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.620]
Not from the measlies.

[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:21.820]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:24.520]
On the 18 T wireless line.

[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:26.120]
Never again.

[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:27.140]
It'll never happen again.

[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:27.380]
Yeah.

[00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:27.560]
Right.

[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:29.920]
They're slaughtering people in Uganda by the hundreds of thousands.

[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:33.340]
Now they're slaughtering tourists over there with a little machete doing an OJ number on them.

[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.460]
Never again.

[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.220]
They're slaughtering people in Kosovo.

[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:38.540]
Never again.

[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:39.300]
You wait and see.

[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:40.780]
We're going to go in there and do something about it.

[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.740]
You better watch out.

[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:42.500]
Right.

[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.940]
And what has God sit back and let this go on by the way?

[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:48.980]
You think he watched that?

[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:50.060]
You're seeing in the Godfather?

[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.600]
Were they said there were animals anyway?

[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:54.580]
Let them move their souls?

[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:57.620]
Must be.

[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:00.740]
Because God was talking about all the slaves and how you treat your slaves.

[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:02.320]
And you do this and you don't do that.

[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:06.880]
See if any of that was divinely inspired, any of that bull crap that was written in the Bible.

[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:11.620]
If it was anything over and above the intelligence or lack of of the people who wrote it in those days,

[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:14.760]
it would have said something like, you don't hold people as slaves.

[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:16.400]
Yeah.

[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:22.320]
And you don't keep women as being subservient and keep them out of the temple and the church and all the other crap

[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:25.700]
and keeping barefoot and pregnant all the time, unless it's convenient.

[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:27.600]
You know something?

[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.860]
There's even something in there's something in the vent.

[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:31.820]
There's a poison in this guy in place.

[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:35.300]
Do you think I'm joking when I attended as a fungus among us?

[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:37.340]
There's something real sick in this building.

[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.000]
And I think it was down here about an hour ago.

[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:42.600]
Here's a mobile in Okachoby.

[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:42.880]
Hello.

[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:48.740]
Hello.

[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:52.420]

[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:53.400]
Hello.

[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:53.840]
Yes?

[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.400]
I've never waited that long for a guy in the film before.

[00:58:58.520 --> 00:58:59.140]
I hear like your nail.

[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.380]
But I just wanted to comment on a...

[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:01.060]
What pain for it?

[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:03.200]
I just wanted to comment on the rap and hip-hop.

[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:03.740]
Yeah.

[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:09.740]
There's an article in a paper that said, hip-hop is the background music for rap music.

[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.660]
So there's something else in the world that you're using for changeably.

[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:15.940]
But hip-hop is also the culture and it's the background music for rap.

[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:16.480]
Yeah.

[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:17.060]
That's all.

[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:17.920]
And it all sucks.

[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.100]
It's beautiful.

[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.380]
It's beautiful.

[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:21.700]
Can I call somebody a d-stag?

[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:22.280]
It's beautiful.

[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:22.800]
Yes.

[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:24.380]
You have to listen to it.

[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:26.000]
Not all of it is good, but a little garbage.

[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:27.020]
Some of it is good.

[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:27.620]
It's dumb.

[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:30.060]
It promotes illiteracy.

[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.000]
It's not poetry.

[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:31.800]
Not all of it.

[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:34.700]
It promotes illiteracy, violence, and stupidity.

[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:35.500]
Not all of it, though.

[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:38.580]
It promotes a culture that is so anti-human and so unacceptable.

[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.160]
Can I call someone a d-stag?

[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:40.420]
Sure.

[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:40.860]
Okay.

[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:43.960]
And it still sucks.

[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:44.780]
There you go.

[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:45.940]
She says it's beautiful.

[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:49.260]
Is there anybody else out there that thinks that hip-hop is beautiful?

[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:49.580]
No.

[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.600]
Come on, let's do it.

[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.400]
They're not doing much on these phones.

[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:53.940]
Come on here.

[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.340]
A little too much of that one.

[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.300]
Plus I'm having my lunch now anyway.

[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.660]
I just want to have one good last meal before I quote from the QA and corporate disease.

[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.400]
No matter which one of these places you go to, they all got their own corporate goddamn disease in this town.

[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:09.300]
God forbid.

[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.840]
Like I said, we still have a lot of people who are not doing it.

[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.180]
So I have a goddamn exterminator.

[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:17.640]
We don't have a bug man that comes in here once a month, once every six months, once every year, once every sookas.

[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:18.600]
Do we have one?

[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:18.920]
No.

[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:19.240]
No.

[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:22.820]
Here's a mobile and four-letter.

[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:23.220]
Hello.

[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:24.840]
Hello, Neil.

[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:25.320]
Yes?

[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:27.500]
Neil, for a long time.

[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.360]
I want to give you some help with your twitching eyelids.

[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:30.820]
Yeah.

[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.720]
What you want to do is warm compresses.

[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:35.260]
Five minutes on each eyelid.

[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.140]
What do you mean on each eyelid?

[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:38.580]
I've only got one of them that's twitching.

[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.260]
Only one twitching?

[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:40.440]
Yeah.

[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.880]
Yeah, just get a, you know, I think I've just got this spot.

[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:43.100]
No, what's that?

[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.280]
It's not, it's not, get a gay spot.

[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:45.820]
This clock.

[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:46.580]
Or this clock?

[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:50.440]
Yeah, or, you know, just a little bath clock, warm it up and put it on your eyelid.

[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:51.040]
Yeah.

[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.200]
And then it will.

[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:53.800]
And after about five minutes and that, I'll take care of it.

[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:54.740]
But what causes it?

[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:55.500]
Stress.

[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.400]
That's what it is.

[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.140]
You got to stress.

[01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:58.840]
It's this place.

[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.240]
It's that goddamn Maddie, the food Nazi upstairs.

[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:05.120]
If he knew that we were eating food down here right now, he'd be jumping up and down like Napoleon.

[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:08.240]
Neil, can I call some of the dish bags?

[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:08.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.300]
Neural, the Louisville, your two big flaming dish bags.

[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:12.600]
Okay.

[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.280]
See it?

[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.100]
Give me the dish bag.

[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:15.860]
Well, I'm sitting here naked.

[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.980]
And I got that picture of what's his name.

[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:19.580]
Did we ever get a call on that, by the way?

[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:20.140]
Of course not.

[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.460]
Let's talk about something important today.

[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:27.120]
I brought this up the day before I went on vacation and it was like talking, it was like starting into a windstorm.

[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.860]
Now I realized that we've slipped a lot being on this second-rate station.

[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.640]
But I'm going to tell you somewhere out there, there's somebody who went to Palmetto High.

[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:38.440]
In fact, there's probably somebody that was on the Palmetto High swimming team.

[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.220]
Are you going to start this crap again?

[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:42.840]
Yes.

[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.100]
I just noticed this picture.

[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:46.720]
Thank God George didn't throw this out.

[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.160]
Brendan Barmer.

[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:50.760]
Brendan's got a new friend.

[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.020]
He doesn't know it yet, but I'm Brendan's best friend.

[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:53.800]
He isn't aware of it.

[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.140]
So this was what they was.

[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.500]
This was the Harold Sports section on Thursday, February 18th.

[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.140]
That was the morning I went on vacation that day.

[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:04.700]
There's a big story about how Brendan goes to a Duquesne University.

[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.280]
He's a 20-year-old walk-on swimmer.

[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.840]
And today he's a bodybuilder and a this and a that and all these other things, all these things.

[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.980]
And he finishes the runner-up and the Kellogg's raising brand Crunch-Crunchathon.

[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.660]
And I've done, oh, that's ready.

[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.780]
He did 6000 abdominal crunches and all this other crap.

[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:24.140]
And it shows Brendan sitting there with his shirt open and a big smile on his push.

[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:29.220]
And I'm thinking to myself, well, if Brendan would just show up here, I could have like a little appetizer.

[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:32.880]
Huh? Did anybody ever call and say, oh, I went to school with Brendan?

[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.120]
I know who that guy is.

[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:34.980]
Of course not.

[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:39.320]
What the hell is wrong with you people out there?

[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:40.320]
Don't you know anybody?

[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:40.620]
No.

[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.440]
I mean, the people we know are like so unimportant and most of them so ugly.

[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.620]
Here's a mobile and sunrise.

[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:48.980]
Hello?

[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:51.920]
Mobile and sunrise.

[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.060]
Going once.

[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:55.320]
Okay.

[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.280]
Open line and Broward to and date 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:02.480]
Here's Miami.

[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:03.120]
Hello?

[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:03.700]
Hello?

[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:04.260]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.040]
Yeah, I want to talk about hip hop.

[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.260]
I mean, I don't know about that girl thing is beautiful.

[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:08.660]
Yeah.

[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:11.820]
It ain't really beautiful, but a lot of it has a lot of positive messages.

[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:12.280]
Like what?

[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:16.180]
Like, like, a feature woman to a pulp and that goes through some folies.

[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:17.020]
No, that one.

[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.100]
Now, see that?

[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.620]
See those different types of rappers.

[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:20.840]
There's a lot of deep rappers.

[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:21.700]
There's ones that promote.

[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:22.560]
There was deep?

[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.880]
Like deep, yeah.

[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.920]
Like deep like in your rectum.

[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:27.300]
That deep?

[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:28.560]
No, no, no.

[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.080]
Way in there?

[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:29.740]
No.

[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:30.600]
Deep with deep.

[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.160]
They talk about issues.

[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.220]
A lot of people talk about real issues.

[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:37.780]
Some talk about political stuff, which really doesn't interest me.

[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:38.860]
Good on it.

[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:39.680]
You know, but like.

[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.360]
Yeah, out of that crap.

[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.020]
I don't like politics, but whatever.

[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:49.540]
It's like, it's different because you have some rappers that are talking about, yeah, I'm going to pull out my gat or gun, whatever.

[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.400]
You're going to pull out there what?

[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.040]
Yeah, that's another word for gun.

[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:52.760]
I know that.

[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.100]
I thought you said something else.

[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.000]
No, no, no.

[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.340]
They're like, oh, yeah, I'm going to pull out my gun and shoot you.

[01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:02.120]
But a lot of people, they like, there's also like what are the type of music where people fight in?

[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.180]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.780]
Like, do you think Celine Dion is going to scrap or melt more than that?

[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:08.980]
I want to tell you, Celine Dion is the biggest piece of garbage.

[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:10.560]
I can't stand right here.

[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:11.000]
I hear it too, man.

[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.520]
I'd rather hear rap music for 25 hours straight.

[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.200]
I can't stand.

[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:15.300]
Then here's Celine Dion.

[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.440]
She makes me want to barf even if she is Canadian.

[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.220]
I can't stand that bitch.

[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:22.780]
I hope she elopes with God in that little fag at what's his name?

[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.600]
Leo de Caprio.

[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:23.940]
How?

[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.180]
I hate that mega-push.

[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:27.140]
He is the biggest piece of little turd, man.

[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.220]
Even an old fact like me can't stand it.

[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:30.040]
Oh, no.

[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.040]
Yeah, it's the letter he Devman, he got used to that.

[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.160]
I have to take my technicals in.

[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:35.100]
Exactly.

[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.580]
Okay, listen, have a great day, pal.

[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:36.860]
All right.

[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:37.480]
And hop on this.

[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.440]
Okay, we're starting to learn about hip-hop music today.

[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.540]
It's about time we had a blending of the cultures in this town.

[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.100]
And what are we going to do about those island people?

[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:45.160]
I asked that question yesterday.

[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:45.960]
Did we get an answer?

[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:46.180]
No.

[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.440]
See, here's our poll questions for today.

[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.900]
When you see somebody with dreadlocks, which of the above do you do?

[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.100]
Which of the following do you do?

[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:58.720]
One like hell, call a police or both of the above.

[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.480]
See what he's gotten, how much?

[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.180]
Or the other alternative is like...

[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:05.920]
Pukerga.

[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.740]
Like, for example, this morning I'm channel surfing.

[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.080]
One of the shows they had that will be Goldberg.

[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:11.220]
Now, I'm going to tell you something.

[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:14.660]
Well, that was fun.

[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:17.020]
At the risk of alienating my Jewish friends out there.

[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.040]
Whoop a Goldberg, you know what I'm talking about?

[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:19.520]
Yeah.

[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.540]
I don't know about those people named Goldberg.

[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:22.540]
That was fun.

[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:22.860]
Yeah.

[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.860]
But I see her and I immediately start...

[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:27.380]
You know.

[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:29.080]
When you start up chucking in that bird...

[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:29.800]
Like that.

[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.220]
Like maybe you've got a little dog, like mine that's always picking up crap off the ground

[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:33.840]
and off the carpet.

[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.120]
And it's always gagging up.

[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:37.860]
You know, always on the verge of puking its cuts out.

[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:44.640]
When I see somebody with dreadlocks, I immediately start getting violently ill and those

[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:47.640]
rost the people over there in the Netherlands like I'm telling you, I'm stood on.

[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.680]
I mean no place is perfect and that's why they're there.

[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:54.280]
Just to make sure that there's something there that'll be very annoying to cook, bon,

[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.100]
rock, poke.

[01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.100]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.440]
1126 at 560 QA.

[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.180]
I mean, can't the islands people do anything besides drugs?

[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:05.440]
No.

[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.280]
Got there especially?

[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:06.780]
Uh huh.

[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:08.780]
I'm not saddened.

[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:11.020]
It's Samo time.

[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:23.160]
Yes, get down with the man who puts a disk and get functional.

[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:24.840]
MC Samo.

[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:28.680]
It's the album that's flooded its way to the top of the chalk.

[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:30.700]
Please, have a don't hurt yourself.

[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.880]
You get unable to touch it.

[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.720]
Have you viewed her and the Samo's latest lies?

[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:41.500]
You got you.

[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.740]
The critics agree about MC Samo.

[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.580]
Your boy says, get it out.

[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.140]
MTV says, that's easy for you to say.

[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.440]
And Ebony says, say what homie?

[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:54.440]

[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.160]
Oh, damn hell.

[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.020]
Please, have a don't hurt yourself.

[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.480]
Available everywhere on CD record and tape.

[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.700]
Top on it, baby.

[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.940]
It's 1132 at 560 WQM.

[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:07.920]
We're talking music today.

[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.020]
We're talking about people with rehabilitation music like George.

[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.080]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:15.760]
No, seriously, in a few minutes, I'm going to play a record that I like a lot.

[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.500]
I'm going to play a song and then we're going to find out if I'm full of crap.

[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.460]
No, you're already nodding your head.

[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.040]
You're already saying I'm full of it.

[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.460]
It's not the backstreet boys.

[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:30.880]
It's not something that you have to be intimidated by because it threatens your macho masculinity

[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.500]
because if you admit that you like it, are they intimidated?

[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:35.040]
By the way, how's 311 coming?

[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:36.320]
311?

[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:36.840]
They're doing great.

[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.260]
No, 311.

[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.600]
That's if 1-911 is busy.

[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:40.020]
Call that.

[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:43.500]

So let's hit pop on it.

[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.060]
Baby, it's not just a music.

[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:48.760]
It's a lifestyle.

[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:49.460]

[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:50.920]

Okay, call me when you get a phone that works out.

[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:15.760]
I think that was extra chunky.

[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:18.140]
I think Reggie would like that.

[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.060]
Open line in date 1 and brown.

[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:23.280]
In fact, muggy Solomon would have had a great tier to have been done about on his station

[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:28.440]
He was a bookie. He wasn't just somebody that knew all the bookies. He was a bookie. Oh

[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:35.740]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 anybody missed dusty springfield. She died. Anybody remember her? No

[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:43.840]
You know gene siscle dies while I'm on vacation dusty springfield dies yesterday and this town

[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.460]
All they want to hear about is how's Joe to magio how's Joe to who gives a crap about Joe to magio the ugliest man

[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:54.140]
It was ever born. He made quasi motor look like Robbie Benton. That's how ugly he is

[01:10:54.140 --> 01:11:00.960]
And they're all hockin to China about oh joltin Joe to magio. He's 84 years old for Christ's sakes

[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:03.400]
That's old enough. Oh, sorry, ma

[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.020]
That's old enough

[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:13.400]
But I mean for Christ's dusty springfield she was only 60 she was in the prime of her life for a little just beyond you know by 30 years

[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:15.660]
She's dead

[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:22.740]
The great the late the great from breast cancer no less now. What was the story is she was dusty springfield the dyke?

[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.060]
I don't think so and I always think that and Maria's a dyke

[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:28.420]
But she's got a whole bunch of kids which of course we know doesn't prove anything

[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:31.760]
But I tell you one thing she's really going overboard to prove that she's not

[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.220]
In fact when she comes out to sing the she came out the last game

[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:42.900]
At Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto that awful six to lost the Chicago at the end of the game

[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:44.680]
They brought her out to sing that real

[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.540]
Pureful song whatever was that Canadian song up in action land them

[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:51.880]
And I'm gonna take her something a lot of guys were thinking we should have suited her up at least might have won a game

[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.540]
She is butcher than most of those bag hockey players up to that

[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.840]
That's what Scott melon be told me

[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:01.040]
Here's a mobile in bokeh hello

Hello Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, I just called a few minutes ago my phone cracked out on me. Yeah nice phone nice job

Thank you very much that little pink guy is doing his job

[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:15.500]
Anyway, I heard you mentioned that the station needs a pest control service

[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:19.120]
I didn't say they need one. I say they're too cheap to buy to get one

[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:25.960]
Oh, because I would like to apply for the job, but but there is no job because they're not gonna pay for it

[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.280]
So unless you want to do it for free

[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.960]
Mm as much as I like to meal

[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:34.700]
That's what I'm saying that's why we were one day we had a guy came in off the street heard me belly

[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:38.280]
I can about it and did a little spritz in around you know here and there, but that was it

[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.740]
We got ants falling off the ceiling in this place. I am an ant specialist right

[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:49.200]
And I can't do it for free like muggy Solomon. Okay. Well, thanks anyway pal. Thanks. See there you go

[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:56.300]
Whoever heard of working in an establishment that doesn't have a bug spray guy an exterminator coming

[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.600]
At least once a month

[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:04.320]
Anybody in the in the history of radio ever working a station where there was no exterminator no

[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:07.760]
God

[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:14.360]
Even when I worked at WYND for two weeks in Sarasota that cheap prick pub packs and we had an exterminator

[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:18.440]
Not here. It's not the visibly read way baby

[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:24.300]
But maybe if you realize Greg I'll take you to dinner with Chris and they do have exterminators there

[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:30.740]
I want to bang you in the butt honey. Have you ever turned on the radio and said that son makes me sick?

[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:31.880]
Well now

[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:36.740]
KO Pectake Records presents sounds that make you wanna throw up

[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:49.960]
And songs that make you want to throw up you get staying

[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.020]
But what's the point?

[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.880]
Even George who and now you heard me play this the other day

[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:47.880]
And you hate it? It's weak. I don't hate it. It's just very mild

[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:50.180]
Nothing there

[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.220]
But go ahead

[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.320]
She's already poison the atmosphere

[01:14:59.480 --> 01:14:59.820]
Yeah

[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.480]
Perhaps

[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:36.300]

[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:11.280]
And I love, oh I'm getting so mad at you

So every week I might

[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:44.140]
That's the story

[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.560]
Understand

[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:51.920]
I live a night

[01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:57.680]
And all my dreams are

[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.160]
Blue and blue and dark

[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:04.660]
Well, then just let me try

[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:10.140]

I love, oh you don't cry

[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:27.760]
I'm getting so mad at you

[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.900]
When I get so mad at you

[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:33.540]
I love, oh you don't cry

[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:38.060]
I'm getting so mad at you

[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:49.680]
I love, oh you don't cry

[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:55.680]
I'm getting so mad at you

[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:07.420]
I love, oh you don't cry

[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:16.380]
I'm getting so mad at you

[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:19.660]
I love, oh you don't cry

[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:19.660]

[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:31.020]
I'm getting so mad at you

[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:38.060]
I love, oh you don't cry

[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:39.980]
I'm getting so mad at you

[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:41.780]
I love, oh you don't cry

[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:49.640]
I'm getting so mad at you

[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:53.080]
I love, oh you don't cry

[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:56.840]
I'm getting so mad at you

[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.300]
I love, oh you don't cry

[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:05.040]
I'm getting so mad at you

[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.140]
I love, oh you don't cry

[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:15.880]
Oh you're right

[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:17.900]
All right, all right

[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:18.580]
See they liked it

[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:21.960]
So 11 before noon at 5.60.QM

[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.080]
Okay, make it or break it

[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.380]
They don't know who that is

[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:25.740]
Because it's a European group

[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:26.240]
They're British

[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:28.260]
Steps

[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:30.100]
Number one in London, by the way, for a while

[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:30.660]
Not anymore

[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:33.060]
And actually some days if you live long enough

[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:33.840]
It might be released here

[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.400]
They also got on the same with this

[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.320]
But I didn't realize they did this anymore

[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.580]
Maybe this is very rare

[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:41.180]
That they had a CD single with two cuts on it

[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.640]
Remember the old extended play 45s

[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.300]
That used to have like four

[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.520]
Two on each side

[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:47.540]
And this one's got like two

[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:49.680]
Cutting off

[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.520]
I'm not going to play this

[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:51.540]
But just like a taste

[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:53.800]
Also with that handed hit

[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:54.660]
That's mad

[01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:58.680]
That's what it is

[01:19:58.680 --> 01:19:59.080]
Yeah

[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:00.160]
Perfectly

[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:06.620]
But you know how I feel about the BG's after they screwed me on that American way?

[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.660]
Okay, two open lines today

[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:09.780]
Come on, let's hear it

[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.360]
5.670560

[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.000]
I want you to rush out to your music store right now

[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.180]
And ask for it by name steps and heartbreak

[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:20.120]
You're going to get it?

[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:20.900]
No, of course not

[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:21.660]
They don't have it

[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.780]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello

[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:26.040]
Yeah, what's up, Neil?

[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:26.840]
Yes, sir

[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:28.160]
Yeah, man, listen

[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.260]
I've been listening to rap music for 20 years

[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:31.100]
Oh, God

[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:32.440]
You understand what I'm saying?

[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:32.960]
Yeah, I do

[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.280]
And believe me, man

[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.560]
Miss rap music is the most

[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.840]
Missed, understood, still music

[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:39.440]
Correct

[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:39.920]
Yeah

[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:40.900]
In America

[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:41.460]
What is it?

[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:41.840]
Yeah

[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.160]
Missed, understood, seriously, man

[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.440]
It's from a steady stuff, though

[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:46.020]
It's a music

[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:48.840]
I thought rap and the music were like contradictory terms

[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:51.320]
Correct

[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.260]
And now listen, man, listen

[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:54.000]
That's why they changed

[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.880]
See, that's why they changed it to hip-hop

[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.860]
Because when you say rap, it's easy to put the C in front of you

[01:20:58.860 --> 01:20:59.000]
Right

[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.440]
See, I'm gonna tell you something

[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:00.980]
It was okay

[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.380]
Yeah, listen

[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:04.900]
It was a credit for people like you anyway

[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:05.620]
See what I'm saying?

[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:09.100]
It was created by young black living in the inner city

[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:09.480]
Yeah

[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:10.100]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:11.860]
It's just that corporate America

[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:14.420]
You sound like you make a local off of it

[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:16.000]
So they try to force it on everybody

[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:16.920]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:17.200]
Right

[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.640]
But it was a credit for you

[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.240]
Now what do you mean?

[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:22.660]
Now how badly did you hate that record I just played?

[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:23.200]
Did you hate that?

[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:24.980]
I mean, I hate that

[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.180]
I'm telling you

[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:29.440]
I'm black and I almost saw a white reference to that

[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.100]
You see that?

[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:31.000]
That was a very well-you-right

[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.440]
Five white people, you're right

[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.680]
You saw me from America

[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.140]
For guys like you, the Cursed Bad Rap

[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:39.780]
I mean, it's a new point

[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.140]
Because they want to do it mentally

[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:42.320]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.400]
You're right, it's a mute point

[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:43.660]
Right

[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:45.980]
I'm pressing the mute button right now

[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:46.780]
Have a great day pal

[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:47.440]
All right

[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.340]
I'll read it there at your Roma

[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.120]
All right

[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:51.120]
Okay, we have an open line of day one and brown

[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.000]
Five, six, seven

[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:52.640]
What he be saying?

[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:53.900]
He said it's a mute point

[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:56.700]
Come on, what about this record I just played?

[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.580]
You don't like that?

[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.040]
Don't be such a relentless pick

[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.460]
I know that you think it's pretty good

[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.260]
Yes, you know I don't like it

[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.200]
What an asshole, man

[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.020]
You know that's your season asshole

[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:07.240]
Yeah

[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.180]
How could you not like that?

[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:10.080]
That's a great song

[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:10.680]
Mmm

[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:12.740]
Nothing there

[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:14.220]
It's no 4-1-1

[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:20.000]
Now she's a little sorry I got the talent

[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:20.420]
Yes

[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:21.360]
Good

[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.440]
Who said Jerry Lewis doing hip hop?

[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:27.060]
Here's Poppato B, chill out

[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.960]
Hi, Neil, I'm gonna miss Dusty Springfield

[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.240]
Yeah, here's one

[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:31.920]
Here's one

[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:32.280]
Oh

[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:34.840]
And did you know she was a lesbian?

[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.000]
That's what I thought

[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.980]
Yeah, there was a book about 10 years ago but it was really bad

[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:42.340]
That's why these people don't want to talk about Dusty Springfield, he was a dyke

[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:43.560]
Yeah

[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:47.260]
All these straight guys out there that are obsessed with all the emotional about bull bikes

[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:49.740]
But they don't want to talk about her

[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.420]
Yeah, well she didn't do any videos so

[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:52.240]
Yeah, that's probably it

[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.240]
They missed out

[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:54.660]
What about the one with Anne Bishop?

[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.180]
Well, come on, that's you don't go on the other extreme

[01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:58.920]
Yeah

[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.400]
Okay, well that was a good one

[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.200]
Okay, thank you

[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.160]
Butch up

[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.260]
Open line of day two and Broward

[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:08.800]
In fact, if there's nobody got anything to say about that song, you see

[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.540]
That's what I mean about this town

[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.580]
You're a bunch, a collective bunch of deadheads

[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:15.040]
If you hated it like poison

[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.300]
If you've heard it before

[01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:17.620]
If you don't ever want to hear it again

[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:20.000]
Something, have something to say

[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.260]
Have some feeling

[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:26.040]
When Jean Pitney did that record a town without pity

[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.280]
This is the place that he was singing about

[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.740]
Make no mistake about it

[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:33.240]
These people no matter what it is

[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.560]
They have no opinion

[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:37.400]
They're like, they're like, I've told you before vanilla ice cream

[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.900]
That's why every time I bring that thing up

[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:40.440]
They all live in the raised their hands

[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.760]
Oh yeah, we love vanilla ice cream

[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:42.880]
Sure it figures

[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.180]
It's only a small segment of the population

[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:49.280]
That have enough taste that have real taste buds

[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.780]
That can enjoy fish food

[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:52.580]
And all the other great Ben and Jerry's flavors

[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:54.080]
That have some taste to them

[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:58.000]
But Taffioca putting in vanilla ice cream man

[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.320]
How about you? They're like eating wonder bread

[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.980]
Not even with anything on it

[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:03.000]
Just right out of the bag

[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.020]
Just stuffing wonder bread down their puss

[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:10.380]
Here's Miami, hello

[01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.700]
Hello, Neil? Yes, Caldy

[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.060]
Neil, I love fish food

[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:17.820]
Yeah, I hate vanilla ice cream

[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:20.720]
And I even hated that song you played even worse

[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:21.480]
Really?

[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:22.380]
It was terrible

[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.720]
The last time I heard something like that was in an elevator

[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.620]
Almost initially

[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:26.120]
Yeah

[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:30.300]
You know though, listen to these black guys call and I hate rap

[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:32.220]
Yeah, I hate it with a passion

[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:34.220]
But I'd rather listen to that

[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:36.280]
But anyway, listen to the side track of the high

[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.000]
I got an important point to make

[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.800]
I can't think without music

[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.300]
The black people are falling asleep and that rap was the inventor

[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.180]
Was started by black kids in the ghetto

[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:48.560]
That's not true

[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:49.960]
How about Motown?

[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.940]
At least black kids in the ghetto said that

[01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:53.220]
Oh yeah, I believe that's not true

[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:53.740]
What's in the list?

[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.800]
Randy, a group in the 80s

[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:55.880]
Right

[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:58.420]
Did the first rap song which was

[01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:59.840]
I didn't like the song

[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:02.460]
But that's where rap came from, a white girl

[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:04.420]
Randy's still with the new old spot

[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:05.540]
Yeah, there you go

[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:06.160]
That he had been there

[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.900]
And listen, I wanted to tell George

[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:12.000]
I thought he didn't have a career in the business

[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.220]
Yeah, that's your last week

[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:13.740]
You really?

[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:14.780]
You did a great job

[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:15.140]
Great

[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:15.880]
Excellent

[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.320]
And I think he'll talk to us by the way

[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:19.560]
Have a great day

[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:20.160]
Take care

[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:24.020]
I really just can't hold it in you

[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:26.060]
You just can't hold it in you

[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:28.180]
Go to Europe where they have all the great music

[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:28.820]
And you come back here

[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:30.460]
Oh, that really sucks man, that blows

[01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:31.720]
Let's hear some rap music

[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:33.140]
Let's start rapping it

[01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:35.020]
And by the way, they've had too much rap musical

[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:36.220]
But they're just obsessed

[01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:39.300]
They got rap artists over there that haven't been born yet

[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.580]
It started way back in history

[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:42.900]
They got all in me

[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:45.200]
It rossed the people in Amsterdam on the street

[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.360]
They turned on the music factory or the box

[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:50.760]
And you just rapping out your...

[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:51.200]
Rack of them

[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.980]
Oh God, on and on

[01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:56.480]
Which at least it keeps some of those people with the raster here

[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:58.260]
Off the streets anyway

[01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:00.180]
Rock, mud, rock, go, go

[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:06.780]
So like I said, what are we going to do about the guerrillas in our midst?

[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:10.020]
But that ross here had me...

[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:10.320]
Yeah

[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.400]
Four minutes till noon

[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:15.020]
By the way, speaking of assholes, what are we going to do about John Penis?

[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:15.900]
Does he work here anymore?

[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:16.200]
No

[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.280]
I mean, is he going to do anything?

[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:17.920]
He's on vacation

[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:18.640]
Oh, he's on vacation!

[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.620]
What year did that start?

[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:25.700]
Because Pompano Park, you know, where they had that big $150,000 race on Friday, September,

[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:29.880]
February, whatever it was, February 27th, which is like several days ago

[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.040]
With a track record, 149 and 4

[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:32.940]
Fantastic!

[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:33.840]
But I have nothing...

[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.900]
I don't have the Simon Cash schedule for the month of March

[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:39.820]
I don't have anything interesting or anything for the month of March

[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:43.820]
All I can tell you is they got great harness racing going on tonight starting 7-35 at the PM

[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:50.520]
The Neil Roger Show on 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale

[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:53.460]
Okay, 12 noon at 560 QAM

[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:55.400]
What happened with what?

[01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.520]
With the bit, with what bit?

[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.300]
I thought you were going to play a bit?

[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:01.920]
Why?

[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:03.200]
You always do?

[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:04.360]
Well, I didn't

[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:08.440]
Okay, because I don't have one cute up because I'm busy looking at Brandon's picture here

[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:09.540]
I'm busy reading

[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:09.880]
Huh?

[01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:11.560]
No, well, that's true

[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:17.080]
I'm eating lunch and I'm either over lunch or the picture and I got a facts here, which is from Yum

[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.300]
Oh, look at this from Club Cathode Ray

[01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:20.940]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:23.140]
From some faggot out there

[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:29.460]
But nevertheless, a great fact that said, Brendan is the hottest, I'm on my knees with my mouth open, Brendan

[01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:32.920]
Yummy yummy, I need an appetizer with 28 exclamation points

[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.100]
All I can say is...

[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:34.280]
Oh!

[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:34.660]
Yeah!

[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:40.580]
See, I hate to break the news to you, but no matter what your taste happened to be

[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:42.380]
Of the legal variety we're talking

[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.420]
You know, nobody wants to look at ugly people

[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.780]
We want to look at beautiful people

[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:48.780]
Just look at that whammy experiment

[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:50.460]
Nobody wanted to look at us ugly people

[01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:54.480]
They put that pens on there and they had a few pretty interesting looking almost naked people on there

[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.340]
And it was a hit

[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:57.540]
What a concept!

[01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.600]
People want to look at people that look great

[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.680]
What a shock

[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:02.900]
Right, Brendan?

[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:04.220]
Uh-huh

[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:06.200]
Just keep saying it

[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.360]
Uh-huh, uh-huh

[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:09.040]
Here's a mobile and sunrise

[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:09.420]
Hello

[01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:11.260]
Hello?

[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:11.760]
Yes, sir

[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:14.920]
Yeah, I just wanted you to know it's just a comment called

[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:17.020]
I love Dusty Slingfield

[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:22.240]
And this morning when I heard about the news, they gave the her age as being 57

[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:22.820]
Sixty

[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:24.680]
And now you say 60

[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:25.500]
That's what they said

[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:29.900]
Yeah, surprised me, but I don't think that there was a more sultry voice than

[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:33.380]
Regardless of what her sexual persuasion was

[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:33.500]
What?

[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:37.580]
Her music will...it's the voice of that time period

[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:40.600]
I'm going to find some in my collection somewhere I'll bring it in the mall

[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:46.700]
Well, there's a one...there's a one CD set that has...that's a pretty comprehensive and then there's a box that's pretty pretty

[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:51.200]
Yeah, there's one CD that I think is Rhino that puts it out

[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:51.580]
Right

[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:53.420]
The pretty comprehensive collection

[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:57.220]
And then there's a three CD set that has like everything

[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:00.500]
And stuff like that that I went ahead

[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:03.860]
But I just wanted a comment that I really appreciate that you appreciate

[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:05.300]
I love Dusty Slingfield

[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:09.540]
She was great in the fact that people who die who give us a little bit of entertainment

[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:13.980]
I'm not saying we got to go up to make a grace land for Dusty Slingfield and act silly about it

[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:17.140]
But at least recognize the fact that she entertained us a little bit

[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:20.460]
Not only that she entertained, but when you listen to her voice

[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:25.540]
It's pretty timeless and the emotion and the way that she was able to put across the song

[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:30.540]
You know, unless you hear her singing, you don't understand the sensuousness

[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:34.780]
And what she was trying to put across and people, a lot of people don't know that she was entertaining

[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:36.180]
Even when she was a young girl

[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:39.440]
Even had her own show I think at one time with her sister from that set

[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.280]
Yeah, in England

[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:42.660]
Well, it was her sister, yeah, that was the best

[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.140]
Yeah, right, it was her sister

[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:52.540]
Up until 10 years ago when they came out with the revelation that I think that for her sense of everything is...

[01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:56.200]
I don't know, it's made some lecture with the sexual misplacing

[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:59.880]
But since it's a voice, listen to what she's saying, why are you saying it? Thanks a lot

[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:00.460]
Okay, thanks

[01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:04.880]
Okay, see we got a couple, thank God we got a couple of people emotional about Dusty Springfield

[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.040]
Good lady, okay?

[01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:08.580]
So she was a little bit too much or for some of you, too bad

[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:12.160]
I can't believe you don't like that, so then I think you're full of it

[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.960]
I think you're just like the guy yesterday that's so-called religious guy

[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:18.280]
That I couldn't get to admit that he knows it's a bunch of crap

[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.560]
You're just playing hard ass

[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:24.740]
I don't think that there's a record that's ever been made that if I played it in here and I said that I loved it

[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:26.620]
That you would agree that it was good

[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:29.140]
Other than maybe Aerosmith, maybe

[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.040]
I like Aerosmith

[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:35.280]
Like when I said that, Crayon was the greatest song of all time, they invented rap, by the way

[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:35.740]
Yeah

[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:40.500]
Oh and by the way, this has nothing to do with that

[01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:43.920]
But I was watching because they had all these stupid info mercials on even in Europe

[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:48.860]
And you know how they're always peddling these one record sets and two these box sets

[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:53.160]
And it was like the best of the, I don't know, one of the 1670s deals

[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:56.360]
And they had one of the cuts on it was I can hear music by the Beach Boys

[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.360]
Which is one of my favorite songs by the Beach Boys

[01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:02.160]
Now did you know who did the lead vocal on I can hear music?

[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:05.220]
Brian Wilson?

[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:05.800]
No

[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:06.600]
Close

[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:07.860]
It's a trick question

[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:10.160]
No way, it's not a trick question

[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:11.840]
Are you only got five boxes?

[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:12.940]
Like love?

[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:14.060]
No, not my glove

[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:17.600]
I said close, so in other words, it must be one of the Wilson's

[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.800]
It wasn't Dennis Wilson, it wasn't Brian Wilson, it was

[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:22.820]
And Wilson

[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:24.880]
Let me give you a hint, fat and dead

[01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:30.640]
Just recently, come on George, Mr. Music Expert that's getting red in the face

[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.840]
You look like you just caught whatever I got

[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:36.660]
Red in the push, beat red, Mr. Music Expert

[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:38.200]
That's not the Beach Boys

[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:38.640]
Why not?

[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:41.160]
How about Al Jardin?

[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:42.780]
Who?

[01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:43.440]
Yeah

[01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:45.500]
You putz

[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.600]
How about David Lemongello?

[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:47.200]
Yeah

[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:50.080]
Come on, Wilson

[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:52.040]
Pete

[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:55.220]
Well, California

[01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:56.040]
Close

[01:31:57.460 --> 01:31:59.080]
Carl Wilson, you schmuck

[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:01.600]
I can't name all the Beach Boys

[01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:03.220]
Why?

[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:07.300]
Because I was an embryo with Dennis Wilson the drummer, he's dead, he drowned

[01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:08.680]
Remember Dennis Wilson the blonde one?

[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:11.320]
Brian Wilson, he's not dead, just brained it

[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:13.960]
The bed guy, that's Brian Wilson and I know Mike Love

[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:14.120]
Right

[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:17.900]
Because he wears that mic love, who's like a real Republican which made us turn on him badly

[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:20.660]
But nevertheless, with a high fault dead of all the rest of them

[01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:28.200]
And Carl Wilson and Al Jardin and then in the beginning before Al Jardin there was a broad David Marks

[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:31.440]
Who was the only one that ever looked good and they said get out of here because we all look pretty ugly

[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:35.840]
Well, you know, some people thought Dennis Wilson wasn't the bed because he was blonde and a surfer kid, he was ugly

[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:37.000]
He's dead, he drowned

[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:40.880]
Carl, now see, sidetracked me off the whole thing there

[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.560]
I never knew that Carl Wilson did do that in either songs

[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:47.560]
I always thought it was either Brian Wilson or it was Mike Love

[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:54.800]
So I just mentioned that and of course it brings to mind the fact that he was young and fat and he's dead

[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:01.020]
Just mentioned that in passing book, young, fat, dead, prematurely dead

[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.120]
Trying to help that guy, you know

[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:05.420]
Here's Miami, hello

[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:07.460]
What is it?

[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.660]
Okay, they're gay, don't have time for the game players, okay?

[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:12.840]
Go play with each other

[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:17.840]
Two open lines and date five, six, seven, five, six, ten, five, five, six, ten, and a mobile one line

[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:20.580]
Mobile in the curl spring, hello

[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:23.080]
Yeah, Blue, remember Chris Farley

[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:23.700]
Boob

[01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:27.120]
Yeah, I was just saying Boob remember Chris Farley, he's gotten dead

[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:35.140]
Anyway, my eager old daughter wants to know what mall that band is playing in next, you know

[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:36.020]
She wants?

[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.980]
She wants to know what mall that band is playing in next

[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:44.960]
All right. I mean, holy cow. You know, how do you go from aerospace to a lot of pop band like that?

[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.080]
I like all kinds of music. Would you

[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:53.440]
I mean, wait a minute. Okay. I was just talking about the beach boys, right? Right? Would you say the beach boys were like hard rock music?

[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:57.760]
No, of course not. Do you do you like the beach boys? I

[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:02.280]
Can't enjoy it. I mean, I mean, I'm you know, I'm only 29. I just go here and there, but yeah

[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.940]
Sure, so it's fine. I like all different kinds of music

[01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:11.520]
That's even different to what you're playing now. I met the budget Tiffany want to be sure playing over there now. No, yeah, I mean holy cow

[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:16.160]
So you're hitting whatever you hated it. I couldn't stand it to be quite on

[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:22.280]
But that's what we're trying to at least get some emotions. I'm feeling out of these people even if you hated it's better than having no opinion

[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.240]
The worst part is that I

[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:28.360]
I like you so much. I couldn't even change channels hating that music as much as I did

[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:33.720]
Well, it's only four minutes and 25 seconds out of your life. It was brutal Neil

[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:39.880]
I'll never play it again. Thanks only in the car. You're the best would you rather hear that or guilty? Oh

[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:41.920]
Okay, I think about it

[01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:43.100]
See

[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:47.340]
There's a choice. What was a little harsh with that mall comment?

[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:54.140]
We have an open line at Broward five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty rhymes with six on the mobile one line

[01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:58.440]
I think there'll be everything that is big is Aqua. Hey, I hate to break the news to you

[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:07.780]
But they're already that big they're gigantic that I told you number one in London big all over Europe the video all over the place steps

[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:11.160]
And I'll be over here eventually and I'll be very big over here

[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:14.120]
Now I would agree just being big doesn't mean that they're good

[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:16.880]
Look at that 8 11

[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:23.380]
Oh thank heaven to the 7 11 get it out of here with that crap. Oh, man, it music. It's real

[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:27.280]
It's real. We got on the sand and rap music it's the brother in the ghetto. It's crap

[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:31.040]
It's garbage. Baby. It's dumb. It's dumb music for dumb people

[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:35.900]
With taste deep inside their vacuum. Wow. Just ask Pete Volga. He'll tell you

[01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:40.080]
We got the hangover show from the D'Arala to this afternoon

[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:46.900]
We got big fat tubby booge shamby from the National Car eating center with six o'clock with his hour and then

[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:53.340]

[01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:56.460]
Let's fill that you went up. It's a mighty big game

[01:35:56.460 --> 01:36:00.100]
You know Boston won last night beat Phoenix three to two Phoenix are staggering and

[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:06.600]
The Bruins are now two points ahead in Montreal one air game and the Rangers got a tie with Dallas and Washington beat the

[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:11.880]
Snot out of Tampa so all the teams on right in there with the the Panthers for that number eight playoff spot

[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:14.720]
Got at least a point last night and most had a win

[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:22.540]
So this is a humongous game last night have a little passion a little feeling come out to the macarita night bring two 300 bucks get a soda

[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:33.340]
Where do you find date pepperon and jeans hummus white where you got it sports radio five sixty two eight I am just

[01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:34.700]
Distraught

[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:40.560]
Distraught can you believe this? I'm looking and looking at see one of the scams that they pull on these best of

[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:44.860]
CDs for various recording artists you know groups that have actually had more than like one half of a hit

[01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:51.840]
Is they make you know the greatest the best the and they look like ten different versions and all of them have got

[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:54.940]
Something that one of the other ones doesn't have you know what I'm saying

[01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:59.040]
So I'm digging and digging through my CDs over here

[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:01.260]
No

[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:04.260]
And is it on here? No

[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.260]
It's definitely on one of the ones that we got in here somewhere

[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:11.980]
Huh because I'm right like the front. I know what the front of the other one looks like

[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:15.460]
And it's not this this is the Beach Boys greatest hits

[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:19.660]
I'm not I'm not that I'm saying there's a lot of bad stuff on here. There's good stuff like

[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:27.480]
Yeah, and isn't that kind of syrupy too by the way they're saying that that heartbeat by steps with syrupy

[01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:30.940]
surfer girl that's not syrupy

[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:36.960]
Huh I diabetes is starting to act up. I my blood sugar is raising the 300 just here in the first four hours

[01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:46.080]
So your center is like wood syrup and bad syrup. Yeah like maple syrup

[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:50.300]
You like syrup from a jar

[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:58.020]
Yeah, good idea. I want to hear I can hear music by the Beach Boys with Brian with Carl Wilson

[01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:03.660]
Which you didn't know say you can talk a good game and you can try to convince the public you know something about music

[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:05.800]
But we all know that you don't

[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:11.420]
Maybe music maybe like hook or rock you know, okay? Maybe like hook or rock. Yeah, all right chat. Maybe you know that

[01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:12.340]
There's no reason I should

[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:21.020]
Yeah, but I do why not because I was a member of your then yeah, I know a Rudy Valley. Yeah, I wasn't born then

[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:25.200]
And then all about the I don't want that the fact that we don't have a balance that wasn't all this fossil rock

[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:31.220]
I saw silent movies at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. Hey, I could name three out of a how many Beach Boys

[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:35.500]
But not to name Carl Wilson

[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:38.920]
Aren't you embarrassed he just died here like months ago

[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:43.860]
Carl Wilson he's dead, but I do a lot of drugs. Oh, well, so today

[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:48.500]
Here's a big report in somewhere mobile in Miami. Hello

[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:50.440]
Hey, Neal's going okay, sir

[01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:55.160]
Big report in South Beach heading east probably the McCartney Causeway

[01:38:55.160 --> 01:39:00.240]
There's one pig standing up sticking its gun at everybody and three more on bikes

[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:07.260]
So anybody heading east probably the McCartney Causeway slow down and be careful. Thank you sir god bless you

[01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:14.540]
One other thing. Yes, boys are not that van hailed vintage van hailed in narrow space a hundred times better than what

[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:22.940]
The vintage van hailed with David Lee Robb and Harold Smith now even out of the back then way better than the Beach Boys. Okay

[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:27.580]
Later, yeah, I'm not saying the Beach Boys are as good as Erasmus now van hailed

[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:32.280]
Because I hear of David Lee Roth and David Lee growth

[01:39:32.860 --> 01:39:37.520]
And I skid like a growth like a mole starts growing in my lip. Oh, and that's another thing by the way

[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:40.220]
I want to know sometimes I'm so glad that this guy called

[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:43.200]
Not intentionally, but he like I said way into it

[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:48.860]
People with but I know I'm an old folk in I'm not into a lot of stupid stuff. Thank god

[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:54.060]
Body piercing is one thing and to me all of it not some of it all of it

[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:58.020]
I'm not talking like a little earring all of it depends on how many they are and how much they droop and what you're real

[01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:00.900]
What the message is supposed to be which is usually a lie anyway

[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:06.620]
I'm talking about real body piercing people that do the body piercing in their tongue

[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:12.260]
Seriously are these people crazy? Uh-huh

[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:19.680]
If you had any and it goes to show you just like my the reason that I bring this up today my discussion about religion yesterday

[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.120]
It goes to show you

[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:28.140]
That if you tell people that something is trendy fashionable acceptable. It's uh, you know

[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:29.480]
It's in

[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:30.960]
They'll do it

[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:39.020]
You have got to be the most stupid idiotic piece of turd with no respect for your body even if it's a you know

[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:41.920]
Look at my body. Do I have respect for this one? Who the hell could?

[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:48.380]
But even as fat and disgusting as sick as I am when I put like a post in my tongue no way sweetheart

[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:57.900]
And of course you do realize that a lot of people got infections from that and many of them died they died they died they're dead

[01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:03.240]
What let me let me do it huh? I have to speak to pop up. I don't think I did tongue

[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:10.880]
Seriously not to mention many other things I can think of that I might get in a way up

[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:12.280]
I mean how do you eat?

[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:17.080]
You know how every now and then while you're eating and you're chewing you chew down on your gum

[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:20.300]
I mean on your cheek on the inside of your cheek do that all the time

[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:25.620]
And it's annoying because there's like a big blood blister right there and then you keep touching with your tongue and irritating it

[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:26.540]
It's annoying

[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:33.160]
But when you got a like a ball on your tongue well, I mean like a silver ball on your tongue. Oh, I'm sorry

[01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:35.780]
Brendan uh when you got a silver

[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:40.960]
A silver ball on your tongue that doesn't go away

[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:48.700]
And you tell me what what are you doing your chump down on that how do you chew how do you eat

[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:55.460]
Eat what how you speak when you have a thing about like that

[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:00.560]
Huh? Maybe that's like Tyson's hub maybe got a thing on his tongue. I don't know

[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:02.760]
Oh, and by the way, it was only a small TV set

[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:09.620]
It wasn't a big fan teach man. You want to want to be through there when they put him in the uh in the quarter to dry out my Tyson

[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.300]
Hey, what luck fight anyway

[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:21.220]
Oh, oh, oh god. I can't believe I don't have I can hear music. I'm gonna have to redo a recheck my library see where all the good stuff is

[01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:27.560]
And you must admit there is some good stuff in there even you wouldn't admit that no question musical hardass

[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.220]
The older stuff

[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:32.820]
Where why don't why don't any of these say next is there any special?

[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:35.700]
Huh? Well, how about let's take a candle hello

[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:37.480]
Yeah, you got okay sir

[01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:40.980]
I'm not gonna worry about that party person. I don't understand either

[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:44.120]
Well, what is that what would you ever allow somebody to put like a

[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:46.700]
Of post through your tongue? I don't know

[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:47.300]
God

[01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:52.560]
Um, and then they got him in their penis. They got him in their nipples. They got him in their navel

[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:57.360]
They got you know, they got the people drilling stuff through every part of their body. You can imagine

[01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:03.800]
I was prompted to call because I think we'll look near the end of the last hour you hit this guy calling it about

[01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:10.880]
Blondie being the original rap music crap. Oh god. Neil. Yeah nothing to be further from the truth

[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:18.940]
You know rap has been around for a long time not to accept that it is now, but and I'm not necessarily a fan of it

[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:20.860]
But you know have to give them a props

[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:26.540]
You know they're making a lot of money for the music in their shoes days. Isn't that sad? Yeah crap

[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:28.400]
Yeah

[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:33.380]
And basically it's about it. I am out of material my friend. Okay. Thank you so much

[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:37.040]
I think a Corey started it from a Cincinnati wasn't that his name

[01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:39.420]
Don't you remember the Corey rap?

[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:45.820]
Oh, yeah, I have that video by the way, huh? I had that video at home. Oh my god burn it

[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:50.980]
Two open lines and date were discussing rap. We're talking about I can hear music by the beach boys and Carl Wilson

[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:54.820]
Which beach boy was the best which one was the most macho? Which one is the most dead?

[01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:58.320]
Which one did the most drugs which is the most right wing

[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:03.400]
See that started like a really turning it. Oh, I remember where the hell was it was it here?

[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:07.780]
Where was it that they wouldn't let them sing it some

[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:09.820]
New Year's thing

[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:16.060]
Because they were too controversial was that here? I don't think it was here. That was just a few years ago. Was it here?

[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:21.260]
I don't remember but because they were like a bit because they were a rock group and they're from I mean

[01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:26.980]
They were as vanilla pudding. They were as mom and pop and apple pie as any group that was ever invented

[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:30.060]
I think unamerican was the yeah, I think that was here

[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:31.540]
Might have been here

[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.840]
Not to mention of course the fact that Mike love is always in those Republican fundraisers

[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.440]
They were all good. Bunch of right wingers probably from Orange County

[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:42.180]
Not too controversial the beach boys

[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:45.180]
Man talk about a dead head place

[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:48.260]
Here's Miami hello

[01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:49.900]
Neil yes, sir

[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:55.960]
That's what you played before always a walking like I said yes, it's true bad. Okay, it's worth paying and I'm

[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:58.560]
I'm here again. I have a story for you about on tongue piercing

[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:03.540]
About what tongue piercing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I had a friend on swallow one

[01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:07.300]
And they could get pretty expensive like five years ago. They were like $60

[01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:11.420]
Yeah, she went over. She made it. All you got to do is dig it out

[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:13.200]
That's exactly what she did

[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.520]
Back on when in doubt dig it out and she put it back in her tongue

[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:19.440]
Yeah, she came that you know, it's infected it. Yeah

[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:24.940]
That's pretty disgusting. It is. I mean, there's nothing wrong with piercing that's just a fashion statement

[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:30.400]
You know there's a fashion statement excellent. Thank you so much sir. It's a fashion statement

[01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:36.400]
It was James Watt in 1983

[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:39.440]
The reform at the Washington monument Washington monument

[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:42.860]
Thank you whoever called him with that information and Ronnie Reagan had to go to their defense

[01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:44.420]
The beach boy can

[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:47.460]
Well, he used to be he forgot who they are

[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.520]
We have an open line in day five six seven oh five six

[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:56.280]
It's a fashion statement if you have somebody how about if you took a wooden post and somebody jended in there

[01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:59.160]
Also fashion statement let's face it

[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:05.000]
It's sure is unique. It sure is different and if one person went on if Calvin Klein came on tomorrow and said

[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.420]
This is the new fashion for the next millennium

[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:12.760]
There'd be two million people immediately sticking wooden posts in their rectum running around hopping on it

[01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:13.840]
Talk about hip-hop

[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:24.000]
Crazy people man who just whatever the latest bad whatever no matter how stupid it is no matter how little sense it makes no matter how idiotic how ridiculous

[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:30.060]
Oh, but it's counterculture right that's why there's only 50 million people walking around with bodies

[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:33.500]
You'll be in every part of their goddamn body just just like all the hippies in the sixties

[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:40.260]
Within within a matter of months they all looked the same they all smelled the same

[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:45.560]
They all did the same drugs. They're all I the same crap all of them crap

[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:48.520]
Because they were all individualists

[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:53.660]
Here's a mobile in peppered pine. Hello, no god. Yes, sir

[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:55.340]
Figure four at one

[01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:01.660]
Sheridan street out west near I think it was the cross tree would be like north 70th. That's not about right

[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:09.300]
Could be about seven or eight of them on motorcycles and they all got their thing hanging out and they're lurking in the trees out there

[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:10.480]
So beware okay

[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:15.100]
Also if stick in a steel spikes through my penis is a statement

[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:16.160]
I

[01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:21.300]
Listen it's a fashion statement man. Yeah, well, I'm not listening to that statement

[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:23.780]
I don't well. Okay, I'm a great thing

[01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:28.820]
Yeah, of course if you if you have a one of those things if you have body jewelry in your penis

[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:30.480]
Doesn't it kind of interfere with like

[01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:33.000]
Almost any function you can think of?

[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:37.100]
Doesn't it kind of like get in the way? Yes, well, we'll find out

[01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:41.340]
You know, you got to get with the time and then you got to stop being a whole foggy

[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:44.620]
You got to get with you got to start listening to rap music you got to get your body pierced

[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:49.760]
You got to get a post in your tongue a post in your ear a post in your penis a post in your rectum. There you go

[01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:54.860]
That's what Mike Tyson said he said it felt like a post holy

[01:47:55.540 --> 01:48:00.220]
Maconon this is jobalon the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority

[01:48:00.220 --> 01:48:01.640]
Right. Oh god

[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:11.960]
I turn up the key because the city NBA is dead

[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:16.840]
Well, right when you love to you why

[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:20.380]
Why don't you practice that to treat your own life

[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:24.580]
Didn't you say help the truck and help the city in the wrong way?

[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:34.400]
help the truck and help the truck and help the truck and help the truck and help the truck

[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:36.980]
help the truck and help the city in the air

[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:38.480]
It's the hard without my

[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:45.220]
Now you gotta breathe you might be to pay on the end

[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:52.020]
Or she'll wave the purple die gay and hair cut and it's a thing on the fan

[01:48:54.520 --> 01:49:00.080]
Well, right when you jump the door and I come and you can triple down with it you try

[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:04.960]
You gotta go for the truck and help the city with all the time

[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:16.880]
help the truck help the truck and help the truck and help the truck and help the truck and help the city in the air

[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:18.720]
You know without my

[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:30.520]
You

[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:35.820]
Okay, that's enough

[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:40.340]
Man, am I pissed that I can't find I can hear music and you're lucky because if you don't like that song

[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:41.500]
I would have played the whole thing

[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:43.900]
How can you not like that song?

[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:44.960]
We talked to

[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:53.200]
I just in general I like it. I'm just saying anybody that wouldn't like it. How could you not like it?

[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:59.240]
Of course, you do know what was Carl Wilson that sang Lee vocal on that. Oh, George just swallowed his crap

[01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:02.020]
He just took him on his cafe gubano

[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:06.740]
Well, I'm trying to teach you something. Okay, you're the expert in cyclopedia

[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:12.380]
You know all this useless crap, but anything that has to do with stuff that people are interested in you don't know about you know a lot of

[01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:14.360]
stuff, but it's all useless

[01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:22.100]
Just like this thing that I got you know, do you know anything about that? No, just like all the doctors. You know the same as they do nothing

[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:29.860]
What does it take what how many doctors how much money how many trips

[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:34.340]
How many experts does it take before somebody can diagnose the hang nail in his town

[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:40.340]
But like if you suffer from blue balls for example, you know

[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:47.360]
How many doctors would it take to go any for they look and said oh my god look at that you got blue balls mister how many

[01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:57.440]
Here's a candle hello. Yes, sir. How you doing great. Well, I'm glad you're talking about the beach boys. They are they are the best

[01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:59.700]
Well, now you're getting cured. Well, okay

[01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:01.420]
Anyway, I

[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:06.520]
Pardon, sir. They're okay. I think you know Carl Wilson died. You didn't know he died

[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:13.340]
I know you died. He died of I think lung cancer a couple years ago lung cancer. Yes, smoking too much bad weed. I think is what did it?

[01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:13.660]
Yaman

[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:19.000]
Anyway, help me ronda that that was Al Jardine singing lead

[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:26.600]
Your Al Jardine looks just like my roommate from Michigan State

[01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:30.980]
But anyway

[01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:38.840]
I think music is a great song. It's just I mean there's something about that song. It's just I can't even I can't describe it

[01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:42.500]
You can't put it in the words, but there's just something about I'm gonna have to bring that in tomorrow

[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:47.560]
I'm gonna have a lot of music for tomorrow. I think it's I think it's on an album called sunflower originally

[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:52.240]
Sunflower yes released back in 1970 when the other music kind of sucked

[01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:56.880]
Yeah

[01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:59.640]
Oh, if you're great if you could play that I'll have it tomorrow anyway

[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:05.940]
Also, you know Carl Wilson he was he's the first vocalist when you hear good vibrations his guitar soft singing that song too

[01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:10.900]
What he does yeah, and also got only knows that temple well wait a minute. See now these I can handle

[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:12.740]
God only knows that's

[01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:18.560]
Wouldn't it be nice to have to I like

[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:23.580]
Carl

[01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:28.880]
Carl come on

[01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:35.220]
Yeah, I hate that song. Yeah, what's the other ones?

[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:38.660]
Oh, is that a good vibration?

[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:45.260]
That's probably the last thing he said

[01:52:48.460 --> 01:52:48.820]
Oh

[01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:52.580]
And what was the other wouldn't it be nice I think wouldn't it be nice is also

[01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:55.080]
Yeah, talk about

[01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:57.740]
Yeah, good here like George

[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:05.000]
Are you sure you know, man? You know

[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:12.600]
I'm 32 years old, but I've been listening to the Beach Boys since I could pick up the photograph needle and pop it on the pop it on there

[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:13.780]
Yeah, so

[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:18.980]
Just in case you were wondering I don't know if you were not but Brian Wilson has a new album

[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:27.080]
Brian Wilson made an album. Yes, last summer of 98 I think yeah, and I don't know about what about that first album for that first

[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:27.940]
Brian, don't you remember that?

[01:53:28.780 --> 01:53:29.080]
Oh

[01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:37.100]
Say that I was talking about

[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:39.900]
I

[01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:44.920]
Tried to honk at one of the UCD stores and they just laughed me out of the place. I'm ever playing this on data

[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:45.600]
I think it was

[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:55.560]
Get back in the bed Brian before it's too late. All right listen. Thanks a lot. Okay. See it. I had a Carl Wilson

Oh, that's enough bad really bad

[01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:08.240]
Why do you know when you do all those drugs and when you're spending a lot of time in bed with your teddy bear

[01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:13.360]
He spent a lot of time in bed with his teddy bear. Okay. He liked it

[01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:17.040]

[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:19.120]
Hey, listen, you know sooner or later. We all got to hang it up. I'm thinking about it like the end of the week

[01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:25.200]
Here's a candle hello. Hi Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, I'd like to talk about that these playfield

[01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:27.220]
But just in reference to the beach boys

[01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:33.120]
Um the song that you want to hear I can hear music. Yeah, the songwriting credits for that code at Jeff Barry

[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:38.520]
Ellie Greenwich and Phil Spector that was that was written during the early wall of sound days. Arlen Spector

[01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:40.140]
Phil Spector

[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.500]
And there's also recorded by Ronnie Spector

[01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:49.400]
I just in case I'm looking at a beach boy album in which that's it's on it's on the good vibrations

[01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:53.180]
Greater tits. It's the second song on site. Hey, yeah, I have to bring I got it at home

[01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:56.500]
But anyway, I was said by the death of Dusty Springfield

[01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:01.380]
Yeah, do you remember who big hit I only want to be with you? Yes, okay

[01:59:01.380 --> 01:59:08.400]
When I was talking about the one I sounded like it was recorded at 49 rpm instead of 45 right have you ever have you ever heard the Israeli version?

[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:13.760]
No, like I want to be with juice. Yes, I had 10 seconds of it here. I'd like to hunt for you

[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:21.600]
Oh god

[01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:27.080]
We have an open line of day one and abroward 5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:31.600]
Of course, then on the morning show they got the one that they play only want to be with juice. Oh, man

[01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:35.320]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello

[01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:39.380]
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I like say first of all like saying for a great show

[01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:43.540]
You know anything to keep you sane and it was god forsaken hell. I'm that man. I'm the only thing they got

[01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:45.820]
They're talking about the body peers and you know

[01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:48.980]
I said these people fierce about every per their human anatomy so far

[01:59:48.980 --> 01:59:52.980]
I think if they won't want to make a statement maybe you get into something like body amputation

[01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:57.620]
Maybe lock off a couple fingers or a couple of toes. I think that's good. I think that's gonna be as well

[01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:01.220]
Once we cross into the new millennium. I think that's gonna be end. I think that's the next step

[02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:05.040]
I wanted to chop it out. That's right. Really make a statement right

[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:09.980]
Thanks again, Neil and have a great day. Yeah, a little body mutilation. What's wrong with that? Huh?

[02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:11.780]
I mean, you know

[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:16.780]
Have one in your earring one in your nose one in your penis one in your vagina. Maybe both of the above

[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:18.520]
All of these things. Yeah, there you go

[02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:21.840]

Yeah, you two could be buffalo bill, baby

[02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:30.900]
Oh my god, I bet you we got plenty of a potential buffalo bills with me right now make no mistake about that

[02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:33.000]
How is the thing coming by the way? How is it doing?

[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:37.500]

Here's Miami Beach. Hello

[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:07.380]
Yes

[02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:16.120]
Hello, how are you? I'm just on the air. How's the old Siri doing?

[02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:24.700]
Okay, let's do with it. Yeah, Neil yes, I was on the beach. I'll beach and I see this

[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:30.000]
Basically a bum walking around in a t-shirt, but I say to myself that's overstone and

[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:38.020]
I go up to the to the the lifeguard guy. I'm like is that all over stone right there? You know it was beach with pack on

[02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:43.860]
Sunday. Yeah, I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Who? I was like okay, never mind. Was Oliver Stone? Yes, I walked up to him

[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:46.740]
I know he was when he put that JFK thing together that piece of crap

[02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:52.400]
He's Oliver Stone. Oh man, that guy's Stone A. Yeah, he's the ender. So looking good

[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:56.820]
Honestly, feel real good and I go up to him and I just say you're overstone

[02:01:56.820 --> 02:02:01.220]
You know, I just wanted to say I appreciate he's like don't don't cover he has cover in the stage

[02:02:01.220 --> 02:02:07.200]
He's like don't do that. I'm I'm I'm looking for so yes, I am you know, he's like all freaking out. I was like

[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:12.060]
I appreciate your work. I tell him his work sucks. Thank you. Okay. We have an open line and tape five

[02:02:12.060 --> 02:02:15.440]
There's another another one of those image things state of mind type

[02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:22.200]
He couldn't direct Mickey Mouse to a pick his nose. Okay, that's Oliver Stone that great movie talk radio

[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:26.680]
Remember with Eric Bagotian. Oh god. That's enough to make me make me pierce his tongue

[02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:35.000]
That's how bad that was and then that JFK my favorite scene in JFK was when we're Joe peshy is doing the thing where he's revealing the whole plot

[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.420]
Well, and this one did that one in Barbi, but he did this and this one behind the scenes

[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:47.800]
Just I mean the most pathetic idiotic and then there's the one where Donald Sutherland now there's a guy who ought to have maybe he's already got something in his tongue

[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:55.140]
See donner I can't even say now Donald Sutherland is all of a sudden very big and doing commercials for last couple years

[02:02:55.700 --> 02:03:00.140]
My yeah, my favorite is the one for signal health plan CIG and a and he says

[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:04.760]
Signa signal like it's it's got a thing in it's not a pun

[02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:06.780]
Signa

[02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:12.680]
See, I guess they think that it's kind of like I don't know artsy far see that people are very impressed by that

[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:16.200]
And what happens when they do that is that you don't pay any attention

[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:21.340]
To the to what the commercial message is all you do is pay attention to the speech defect

[02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:25.560]
That's the health plan and you're thinking oh my god, that's Donald Sutherland

[02:03:26.660 --> 02:03:30.220]
Who sounds like Elmer Fudden Daffy duck with Brian Murray

[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.580]
Can't you hear Brian Murray doing spots for it? Signa

[02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:41.680]
We have an open line and date one and brown and five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line

[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:49.020]
You mean that's Andy and Hollywood is that you're suggesting who that might be yeah, Jim or Mitch

[02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:55.160]
One of these jackasses. Hello. It's not Andy. Okay. How are you doing today mr. Roygers? Okay?

[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:59.360]
Um Michigan state grad here on the phone checking in you don't sound anything like Andy

[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:04.020]
I think you're just slipping now not Andy. Got a bad ear. That's why I just taste the music is so bad

[02:04:04.540 --> 02:04:08.880]
Just wanted to give you a little frog story that I had at the golf course the other day

[02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:12.040]
Yeah, my uncle's down for Michigan

[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:14.160]
So I'm gonna take him golf around the way to the course

[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:17.640]
I'm explaining to him what the the frogs are like down here

[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:19.640]
And he doesn't quite understand and sure enough

[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:22.840]
Me and my uncle and a buddy we get joined up with a frog

[02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:26.740]
They're all over the golf course here in Hollywood. Yeah

[02:04:26.740 --> 02:04:29.820]
Of course he was too cheap to pay for a cart

[02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:34.800]
So the three of us are in carts and he's walking which held us up for the first three holes

[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:42.000]
And then he asks if he can hop in the open space in the cart that my buddy has so he got a free cart right there. No

[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:45.340]
Well, you know we're nice people so we let him

[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:52.860]
Then I buy the guy a beer and the drink cart comes around and the drink cart comes around the second time and he doesn't get his wallet

[02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:54.840]
No drinks when it's his round

[02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:56.240]
and then

[02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:00.900]
We get to the green and much to his surprise when he offered me a cigar

[02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:04.660]
I already had a lit dubian my mouth because I like to do that when I golf

[02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:05.800]
Yeah, man

[02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:07.460]
And so you know

[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:12.600]
Anyways, I was just kind of interesting as I was explaining to him about all the frogs down here

[02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:16.360]
Of course we get joined up with one and it was about a five hour round of golf

[02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:23.660]
And long back to had a good time. Yeah, we had a great time and Neil I root my balls off for those tickets tonight. Okay

[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:33.220]
What are these people talking about what are they talking about what tickets? I said there's

[02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:41.100]
1400 unsolved tickets for the night's game. I didn't say we have any did I say that no and we don't do we have any I got my own way of any others no

[02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:48.840]
We don't give crap away on a show anymore sir. We give nothing but pure entertainment the prices right it's free

[02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:51.060]
I

[02:05:59.860 --> 02:06:05.660]
Great music but bubble gum see there's nothing wrong with bubble gum and you're a big thing with the backstreet boys is always

[02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:09.180]
Oh, that's bubble gum. That's for like, you know bad bubble gum wrong

[02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:14.020]
In fact in Billboard magazine last week there's a big piece which you would have agreed with most of it

[02:06:14.020 --> 02:06:18.820]
Where they're talking about the formulas where they have all these groups the five and the 98 whatever they're all

[02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:23.000]
These groups that are like all patterned after whatever the for you know new kids on a block

[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.620]
But there was one before they were created by the same guy right but

[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:31.920]
And it said the average shelf life is very short not five years like you were saying but like no less than that

[02:06:32.460 --> 02:06:37.580]
But it said the difference between the backstreet boys and all the other groups is that these guys can really sing

[02:06:42.460 --> 02:06:47.020]
Now you can you can sit in there and laugh and puke and let me tell you again

[02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:52.920]
One of them that I would even think about doing okay. They're none of them that look good and there is a one of them that can sing

[02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:56.040]
Oh, now that's see that's it's just ridiculous. You're just a high-end

[02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:58.060]
I thought there are other live thing on Saturday night live

[02:06:58.060 --> 02:07:03.940]
They were groaning and straining and missing the notes that they were all over the place. They couldn't find it with a map

[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:06.780]
And the notes you told me he can find it

[02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:10.200]
Here's your candle hello

[02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:14.400]
Hello, Neil. Yes sir. Yes, I have a question for you. You really tell me confused

[02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:19.220]
Why is it the one day you're kissing somebody's ass on the radio and then the next day you just rip in their butts right out?

[02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:20.720]
And who would that be sir? Who?

[02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:24.420]
Yes, for example you have Steve King who you always talk trash about right?

[02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:29.360]
But yes, it is that you're okay in my book because he sent me flowers. That's right. I mean that's two face

[02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:32.180]
No, it's not I said that I can't stand exact and he's full of crap

[02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:36.120]
But I appreciate the flowers and he's okay because he's balanced and he's made himself a life not too face

[02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:39.860]
I told it exactly the way I'm always there but you're the same blowing out your ass pal

[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:44.560]
Blow it right out your little ugly ass. I tell it exactly the way I see it

[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:48.920]
And when somebody does something goes out of their way to actually spend money to do something nice for me

[02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:53.180]
I appreciate that and if you can't handle that go to hell okay go straight tail

[02:07:53.180 --> 02:07:57.000]
Don't stop in purgatory. Don't stop and see the pope unless you got your lips all greased up

[02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:01.440]
Get out of my face and get back out of banana boat by the way and go back where you came from

[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000]
Too many people here from the wrong places. That's the problem with this town

[02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:10.480]
Too many people here from the wrong places

[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:17.500]
Open line and Broward to end date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line

[02:08:57.420 --> 02:09:03.340]
Tina Turner. Oh, man. I just get a hold of her love because it sounds to me like a bunch of bull crap

[02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:10.460]
Is what it sounds like to me. Okay, we have an open line and Broward to end date five six seven oh five sixty pound five nothing about the body piercing

[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:15.520]
We don't have it hurt for many but it's got a poet a poet a poet in the and probably because they can't speak

[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:22.200]
Maybe if he just mumbled a little bit maybe like that and we'll know that you got a post in your tongue and you can't really speak

[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:25.360]
Oh boy, it's the one to two hour

[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:32.540]
We're on Jerry. Oh, we're on the right hand of God

[02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:41.480]
I woke up today. I put my TV on and instead of traveling or CNN. I saw purple creature with a gay sign on his head

[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:45.220]
It wasn't upside down triangle purple thinking wing

[02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:50.760]
Upside down triangle purple thinking wing

[02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:58.620]
Where will just when I thought things couldn't get worse. I know to see was carrying a little

[02:09:58.620 --> 02:09:59.160]
First

[02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:04.900]
I have a round

[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:05.220]
I

[02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:22.960]
Will most of our Christian times is hard to believe but on the teller tell me something is a TV screen

[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:28.840]
A purple bean is pointing straight at me that was blowing an eye through the hole in the sink

[02:10:39.060 --> 02:10:39.660]
Oh

[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:48.060]
You're gonna put him to be boys in the same class with aroismeth

[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.340]
You're comparing Carl Wilson with Steve Tyler

[02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:54.820]
and

[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:00.700]
You're serious you put them in the same level

[02:11:00.700 --> 02:11:04.840]
Well, their new stuff isn't as good as the old beach boys, but the roll stuff is

[02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:09.960]
You're let me say it again. I just want to make sure I'm understanding what you're saying the beach boys

[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:16.320]
Yeah, bubble gummy surfing car, living loving eating

[02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:22.040]
Beach boys, you're putting on a musical level with aroismeth sure

[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:30.280]
Here's a lady mobile in bokeh hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am

[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:36.500]
I was just gonna tell you that my cousin here is an advantage to it. He's got what pierced my tongue

[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:39.620]
Oh, you're your tongue. I thought you said your son was pierced

[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:40.900]
if I could

[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:43.900]
Your tongue is pierced and what's the advantage?

[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:48.780]
Well, I got it because it's supposed to enhance the certain sexual situation. Yeah

[02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:53.440]
And because that's the springfield the sister mine. I can tell you my girlfriend agrees that it does work

[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:55.280]
So there's an advantage to it

[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:57.780]
Uh, okay, whatever you said

[02:11:57.780 --> 02:11:59.240]
Exactly whatever she said

[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:04.280]
Here's the fact that says Celine Dion makes me want a puke. I can't stand that frog bitch

[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:08.120]
Leo de caprio is a huge flaming queen. He's not fooling anybody

[02:12:08.660 --> 02:12:11.780]
But he's fooling a lot of young girls. I'll tell you that. That's what Nick told me

[02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:15.100]
Says when he kissed Kate Winslet and Titanic. I thought it was a lesbian scene

[02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:18.080]
And the movie sucked anyway right on

[02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:24.880]
Wherever you are and then somebody faxes me all of this stuff about Donald Sutherland who was born in St. John

[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:28.520]
New Brunswick, Canada. They and went to the University of Toronto and

[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:29.700]
Et cetera. He's okay

[02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:35.740]
Once he was in that JFK thing that room and that rule was in birison. That was really bad. He was great in the

[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:39.180]
Invasion of the the body snatchers

[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:41.260]
Is that it? Yeah, and I have the needle

[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:47.400]
Yeah, I mean he's a good actor, but it's just these commercials. He's a signal the signal health plan

[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:49.320]
Like the guy with the big lips

[02:12:50.700 --> 02:12:54.460]
We have an open line in the Broward to and date five six seven oh five sixty

[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:59.060]
Is there anybody in this audience look at the way the lines dropped off as soon as you said that

[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:03.060]
No seriously, you're not I want to give you the opportunity to change your mind

[02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:09.300]
Okay, right before God man in the audience on this rainy dreadful god because God is gonna punish us any minute if you keep this up

[02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:11.920]
You were serious old beach boys

[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:18.140]
Forget about old and new okay, I'm just talking as a musical group as talent as a

[02:13:18.140 --> 02:13:24.020]
Force in the music industry as music as sound that's coming out of a thing out of a side

[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:25.660]
Hall of Fame

[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:31.780]
With what the 1910 food gum company sure

[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:37.220]
What did I tell you I?

[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:40.380]
I knew if I gave him enough rope he would hang in the shelf just dead it in the door new

[02:13:41.180 --> 02:13:43.620]
The beach boys and arrow Smith

[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:47.180]
Anybody have a heart or a liver?

[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:10.800]
No

[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:17.120]
Guns and roses

[02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:41.100]
And

[02:14:48.660 --> 02:14:52.460]
I know that you can love me when there's no one left to blame.

[02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:57.900]
So nevermind this darkness, we still can find a way.

[02:14:58.260 --> 02:15:03.140]
Come on, Christmas is less forever, even call no memory.

[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:04.720]
Yes, just do!

[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:08.020]
No memory, welcome!

[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:10.740]
What the fuck?

[02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:11.220]
What the fuck?

[02:15:12.940 --> 02:15:13.560]
What the fuck?

[02:15:17.780 --> 02:15:18.320]
What the fuck?

[02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:20.260]
What the fuck?

[02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:20.420]
What the fuck?

[02:15:20.420 --> 02:15:20.420]

[02:15:20.420 --> 02:15:20.460]
What the fuck?

[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:20.760]

[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:20.760]

[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:20.760]

[02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:26.240]
How do we even want this album, big ones, by Erosmith?

[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:29.100]
I'm just looking at the list of credits on here.

[02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:33.560]
Guess who plays Beratone Sax, Ian Putz.

[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:39.440]
But seriously, see the thing that you don't understand,

[02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:43.360]
obviously the difference between serious music and fun music.

[02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:47.820]
The Beach Boys music was fun, not serious, but it was very good.

[02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:53.580]
Good, but fun, highly acclaimed and enjoyed by many other people.

[02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:55.300]
No, no, so I didn't like the music.

[02:15:57.220 --> 02:16:00.200]
If I didn't like the Beach Boys, it would be different.

[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:03.540]
Then I'd have no credibility in this discussion like you with the Backstreet Boys.

[02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:11.860]
But the fact is that to compare serious music like Erosmith with fun music,

[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:16.080]
again, that was acclaimed because it was good and people liked it and it was memorable.

[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:20.220]
Latter-day Erosmith is more cookie cutter than the Beach Boys ever would.

[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:24.220]
So you keep coming back to that latter day, it doesn't make any difference whether it's latter day.

[02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:25.680]
It goes out and does put out a bunch of stuff.

[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:28.260]
It's just that thing you got with the Mormons again with that latter-day crap.

[02:16:28.700 --> 02:16:29.960]
You just can't get over that.

[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:32.940]
In addition to which the Beach Boys didn't wear no magic underwear.

[02:16:34.380 --> 02:16:36.440]
Here's Kendall. Hello, I don't think. Hello.

[02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:42.380]
You need a producer that's about 10 years older and that way you can talk about music a little bit more intelligent.

[02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:47.880]
I'm sorry, George. What was the 1910 Frucombe company song that you just met?

[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:48.640]
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:49.740]
Oh, that's right. That's right.

[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:53.080]
I got something bad in my tummy and I think you know, another one's coming soon.

[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:59.980]
When I was starting out in radio, I was in college radio in the early 80s, then got in the commercial radio,

[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:01.220]
and now I work in federal radio.

[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:03.080]
In federal radio?

[02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:05.580]
Yeah, the office of Cuba broadcasting right down the...

[02:17:05.580 --> 02:17:06.940]
Oh my God, I'm an audio martini.

[02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:07.800]
You got it. Yeah.

[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:09.240]
So I wanted to tell you a story.

[02:17:09.460 --> 02:17:11.540]
Now, I met Brian Wilson's wife.

[02:17:11.660 --> 02:17:15.680]
She used to shop at the supermarket that I worked at Gelsons, which was a market that...

[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:16.220]
Gelsons?

[02:17:16.220 --> 02:17:17.220]
No, no, no, Gelsons.

[02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:20.500]
It was a market that all the rich people shopped at in in Sino, California.

[02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:25.240]
No matter if that's where the Wilson's were from in Sino and the San Fernando Valley.

[02:17:25.780 --> 02:17:30.500]
And so Brian would come into the supermarket, Gelsons, and he would go to the meat counter.

[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:31.500]
This is a true story.

[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:34.460]
I mean, a lot of people don't know that he spent a couple years in bed.

[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:36.540]
You know, you can say that on the air and it is true.

[02:17:36.740 --> 02:17:37.260]
Oh, it is true.

[02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:38.140]
A lot of people don't know that.

[02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:38.780]
That's any, bro.

[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:42.240]
Right. Well, anyway, he would come into Gelsons to the supermarket,

[02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:46.000]
and he would walk up to a little drain near the meat department.

[02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:48.220]
You see them at publics and wind dicks either.

[02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:52.720]
Usually drains for the water, drains out of either the meat case or the frozen fruit case.

[02:17:53.140 --> 02:17:56.240]
And he'd take out his little pinky winky and he would go right there.

[02:17:56.660 --> 02:17:58.580]
And I mean, this is an honest to God story.

[02:17:58.860 --> 02:17:59.260]
Oh my God.

[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:00.400]
Yes, you believe it.

[02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:01.660]
Yes, I believe it.

[02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:03.160]
Okay, and finally, play more market day.

[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:06.760]
I was lacking, he was lacking in the social raises because he never got out much.

[02:18:07.020 --> 02:18:07.380]
I'm telling you.

[02:18:07.580 --> 02:18:08.020]
I'm telling you.

[02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:09.420]
So I was paying more what?

[02:18:09.780 --> 02:18:09.860]
What?

[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:12.260]
I was going to say play more market day today, but to anyway.

[02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:17.000]
Well, you know, and then then George would try to tell me that the beach boys would be in the same class with Marvin Gaye.

[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.540]
But you know, it's coming from him.

[02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:19.700]
I just I don't know.

[02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:21.860]
You need to know, but seriously, I mean, he's smirking.

[02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:33.040]
So we I'm giving him time to think about it, but on the face of it, anyone who would say who would categorize the beach boys in the same category with Marvin Gaye would need a lobotomy, would need a musical lobotomy.

[02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:33.600]
Absolutely.

[02:18:33.780 --> 02:18:34.880]
Does he help plan paid for that?

[02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:38.560]
I don't know if it's paid for yet.

[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:39.420]
Have a great day.

[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:39.800]
Thank you.

[02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:40.320]
Thank you.

[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:41.380]
You're not responding.

[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:43.420]
Oh, they're much better than Marvin Gaye.

[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:48.800]
And this last guy was a suck whole.

[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:55.440]
What does he know about music just because we saw Brian Wilson, the school, the beach boys were much better than Marvin Gaye.

[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:56.440]
Yes.

[02:18:57.160 --> 02:18:59.260]
But you got something against gay black people.

[02:18:59.420 --> 02:19:00.620]
I love that.

[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:01.320]
Yeah.

[02:19:02.180 --> 02:19:04.960]
The beach boys were better than Marvin Gaye.

[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:06.760]
Their contribution to music guys.

[02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:08.640]
Oh, the head of Marvin Gaye.

[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:11.740]
You know something Tammy Torello, so pissed off. She's about ready to make a comeback.

[02:19:12.060 --> 02:19:12.700]
That's how pissed off.

[02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:14.340]
You all do respect to Marvin who I loved.

[02:19:16.380 --> 02:19:18.220]
Marvin, you're talking about Marvin, Marvin.

[02:19:18.420 --> 02:19:19.320]
He were no beach boys.

[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:20.260]
Two open lines.

[02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:20.860]
Thank God.

[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:21.520]
Two open lines.

[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:21.900]
Indeed.

[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:25.800]
5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the 18t.

[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:26.260]
One of the fun.

[02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:27.760]
Their music was bubble gum.

[02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:28.700]
Good bubble gum.

[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:29.320]
Enjoyable.

[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:29.800]
It was fun.

[02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:30.560]
I like it.

[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:31.300]
I love it.

[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:39.080]
But to say that it's serious music like Marvin Gaye or Erosmith is to reveal a lack of understanding.

[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:40.680]
A lack of taste.

[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:45.280]
So glaring that one might think you were born in a distant barbaric land.

[02:19:47.500 --> 02:19:48.680]
Here is not so distant.

[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:49.440]
Here is Volka.

[02:19:49.540 --> 02:19:49.720]
Hello.

[02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:50.660]
Neil.

[02:19:50.940 --> 02:19:51.240]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:59.620]
My name is Gary and I've been listening for a long time and I've been even calling and telling you about the funniest show you ever did.

[02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:00.040]
Yeah.

[02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:03.160]
How long ago did you move to plantation?

[02:20:04.140 --> 02:20:04.600]
Years ago.

[02:20:04.740 --> 02:20:05.280]
Many, many years.

[02:20:05.380 --> 02:20:06.180]
Ten years, twelve years.

[02:20:06.280 --> 02:20:06.700]
How long time?

[02:20:06.700 --> 02:20:12.040]
Soon after you moved to plantation, they were delivering furniture to your house.

[02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:14.180]
Do you remember that day?

[02:20:14.420 --> 02:20:14.580]
No.

[02:20:15.780 --> 02:20:17.840]
You had a friend's day and it was sleeping?

[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:18.980]
Yeah.

[02:20:19.460 --> 02:20:21.140]
That was when I moved to plantation.

[02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:23.700]
I moved to Jacaranda.

[02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:26.900]
I knew you had just moved.

[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:31.340]
Anyway, you were apoplectic and it was hilarious.

[02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:32.820]
I'd have pulled my car off the road.

[02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:34.660]
It was a funny show you every day.

[02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:35.040]
What a memory.

[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.660]
Anyway, I had to tell you that.

[02:20:37.780 --> 02:20:38.960]
I've been meeting an apoplectic for a while.

[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:41.560]
Well, you're a little slow, Gary, but better late than ever.

[02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:42.840]
Number two.

[02:20:42.980 --> 02:20:44.740]
Larry, I was always being called Dusty Springfield.

[02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:46.720]
I really loved your music, Dusty, and too late.

[02:20:48.380 --> 02:20:51.200]
Before you leave in three years, I guess I'm better call you.

[02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:56.600]
Number two, you talked about religion a lot lately.

[02:20:57.480 --> 02:21:02.920]
I just wanted to tell you, my feelings about religion coincide pretty much with Woody Allen.

[02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:10.180]
He did a movie years ago and he's sitting on a grassy knoll overlooking a lake and he's discussing religion with his beautiful girl.

[02:21:11.580 --> 02:21:12.760]
How old are you about ten?

[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:15.120]
No, it's just a little older.

[02:21:16.820 --> 02:21:27.400]
He says, well, I don't really believe in organized religion, but I believe there's an intelligent force that prevents the universe except for parts in certain parts in New Jersey.

[02:21:28.140 --> 02:21:32.060]
But I would just like to mend that and say, except for certain parts of sunrise and Delray Beach.

[02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:34.260]
Okay, Gary. Come in 12 years.

[02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:34.860]
Take this back.

[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:35.340]
Okay.

[02:21:36.620 --> 02:21:43.060]
This man has just said that the Beach Boys are in the same level with Aerosmith and Marvin Gaye.

[02:21:43.940 --> 02:21:45.540]
And I have an open line on the board.

[02:21:45.740 --> 02:21:47.380]
We should have a backup.

[02:21:47.620 --> 02:21:50.520]
They should blow the lines out on the phone bank right now.

[02:21:50.540 --> 02:21:51.700]
This for any kind of a town.

[02:21:52.840 --> 02:21:55.940]
I just... I can't believe I heard it with my own ears.

[02:21:56.540 --> 02:21:57.680]
The one I'm talking to.

[02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:02.540]
The only choreo was a song.

[02:22:03.540 --> 02:22:06.420]
Oh, so in other words, writing the song is what makes you a great singer.

[02:22:06.880 --> 02:22:09.320]
No, singing makes you good singer. Writing makes you good writer.

[02:22:09.820 --> 02:22:13.240]
Yeah, we're not talking about writers. We're talking writers invented music.

[02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:13.780]
Yeah.

[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:16.740]
Anyone that supports this is.

[02:22:17.820 --> 02:22:18.540]
There's something...

[02:22:18.540 --> 02:22:19.420]
Voice is a retirement zone.

[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:22.740]
So what we see on the dozen write music, therefore, is the dime a dozen.

[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:31.200]
And we see the difference.

[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:31.680]
And we see the difference.

[02:22:32.020 --> 02:22:34.080]
You're right. There is definitely something in this building.

[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:35.240]
Make no mistake about it.

[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:35.480]
God.

[02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:39.220]
If he didn't grind his...

[02:22:39.220 --> 02:22:40.000]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:41.000]
If he didn't grind his what?

[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:44.740]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:22:45.060 --> 02:22:45.180]
Hello.

[02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:46.660]
Neil, you are God.

[02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:48.180]
Yes, you're so wrong.

[02:22:48.420 --> 02:22:48.880]
How about a road?

[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:49.680]
How about that?

[02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:51.400]
DJ's Beach Boys.

[02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:52.060]
The Beach Boys.

[02:22:52.820 --> 02:22:54.940]
Yeah, now we know where this guy is coming from.

[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:57.480]
Beach Boys versus Erasmus.

[02:22:57.620 --> 02:22:58.640]
Not even a comparison.

[02:22:58.740 --> 02:22:59.060]
You're right.

[02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:00.220]
There is no comparison.

[02:23:00.440 --> 02:23:00.580]
You're right.

[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:02.160]
I'll give you three reasons why.

[02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:02.800]
Number one.

[02:23:02.860 --> 02:23:07.120]
Brian Wilson and Michael have put together couldn't lick Stevie Towers' ass.

[02:23:07.460 --> 02:23:08.100]
All right. All right.

[02:23:08.260 --> 02:23:11.180]
How many number one songs do the Beach Boys have versus Erasmus?

[02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:13.220]
Erasmus has one number one song.

[02:23:13.420 --> 02:23:14.100]
They only have one?

[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:15.760]
Only one.

[02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:17.300]
That was that one from the bottom.

[02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:19.380]
We're going to base our...

[02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:21.480]
No, that's not true at all. Are you out of your mind?

[02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:24.560]
No, I just saw it on behind the music the other night.

[02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:26.520]
They said that was their only number one song ever.

[02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:28.080]
I'll find out because I have the book there.

[02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:31.420]
I don't even have any of that pieces to say what's the number one.

[02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:32.920]
Just to know.

[02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:34.200]
I got the book here.

[02:23:34.300 --> 02:23:35.600]
I'll tell you how many number one songs.

[02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:36.640]
See, I don't think...

[02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:40.160]
While you're looking at sports holes, we have an estate editor just open up a mouth.

[02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:42.600]
I'm looking at sometimes having an idea what I'm talking about.

[02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:44.840]
While you're looking at that up, I'll give you another reason.

[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:45.080]
Yeah.

[02:23:45.780 --> 02:23:49.200]
Beach Boys experimented with different sounds and created new music.

[02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:53.300]
What did Harrison ever create that was different from what was already out?

[02:23:53.680 --> 02:23:56.440]
Beach Boys did harmonies that had never been done.

[02:23:56.680 --> 02:24:02.360]
They did tape, they overdubbed four and five part harmonies that had never been done before.

[02:24:02.820 --> 02:24:04.420]
You know, they were interfated.

[02:24:04.780 --> 02:24:05.620]
People got to number three.

[02:24:05.800 --> 02:24:07.680]
The creative this, they didn't have any number one record.

[02:24:07.860 --> 02:24:09.700]
So the one you're talking about from Margaret Gettin is the only one.

[02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:11.960]
It was on Margaret Gettin and that came out after that.

[02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:12.860]
Right, after the book.

[02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:16.140]
So Beach Boys had at least ten number one.

[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:17.020]
What does that mean?

[02:24:17.020 --> 02:24:20.180]
Elvis Presley had more number one records than both of them together.

[02:24:20.380 --> 02:24:23.660]
Are you going to tell me Elvis Presley was better than the Beach Boys and Errol Smith?

[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:24.820]
Yes.

[02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:27.040]
Because he had more number one record.

[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:32.060]
Elvis Presley was one of the top three figures of music of all time.

[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:36.040]
But that doesn't mean vanilla ice cream is the best selling flavor of all time.

[02:24:36.140 --> 02:24:37.460]
But that doesn't make it the best.

[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:38.560]
Don't you understand?

[02:24:39.140 --> 02:24:40.160]
I don't listen to vanilla ice.

[02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:41.720]
Okay, thanks.

[02:24:44.140 --> 02:24:44.500]
Ah!

[02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:49.380]
It's the film everyone wants to see.

[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:50.780]
Vanilla ice dies along.

[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:52.560]
Bloody agonizing, Satanic death.

[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:53.140]
The movie.

[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:55.380]
See, I've dropped from an 18 story building.

[02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:58.700]
Beatin and Mug, by homeless people.

[02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:00.120]
Just get the phone, break the faith.

[02:25:00.300 --> 02:25:00.800]
Oh my God!

[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:05.340]
Run over by a milk truck and club the death by a group of angry seventh graders

[02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:07.040]
while being forced to listen to his own music.

[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:08.520]
No, I mean, you do suck.

[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:09.640]
Vanilla ice dies along.

[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:11.300]
Bloody agonizing, Satanic death.

[02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:11.660]
The movie.

[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:15.760]
See former surgeon general, see if it could extract the ice band's tongue and save the world.

[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:17.000]
Change shall it says.

[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:19.060]
It's the failed good movie of the 90s.

[02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:20.000]
Vanilla ice dies along.

[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:21.500]
Bloody agonizing, Satanic death.

[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:21.960]
The movie.

[02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:23.300]
A cheesy T-N-I-L production.

[02:25:23.780 --> 02:25:26.280]
Tarika loves to watch boobs and butts and biting.

[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:29.900]
Oh, black.

[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:49.240]
The movie.

[02:25:52.500 --> 02:25:59.820]
The movie.

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:25:59.840]

[02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:04.460]
The movie.

[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:08.340]
The movie.

[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:17.280]
The movie.

[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:19.240]

[02:26:19.380 --> 02:26:19.380]

[02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:19.840]
The movie.

[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:20.000]

[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:20.000]

[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:20.000]

[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:20.280]
The movie.

[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:20.340]
The movie.

[02:26:20.340 --> 02:26:20.360]
The movie.

[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:20.360]

[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:20.360]

[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:20.360]

[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:20.360]

[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:20.360]

[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:20.360]

[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:20.360]

[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:20.360]

[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:20.360]

[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:20.360]

[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:20.400]
The movie.

[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:20.480]
The movie.

[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:20.480]

[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:20.480]

[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:21.420]
The movie.

[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:23.960]
The movie.

[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:24.220]
The movie.

[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:30.360]
How's it hanging Brendan?

[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:30.360]

[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:32.220]
How's this hanging?

[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:38.540]
You know that thing that got in Jersey?

[02:26:38.620 --> 02:26:39.840]
The Brendan Brewners Expressway,

[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:43.460]
it's a 131 at 560 WQM, we have an open line to date.

[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:48.680]
560, 560, that last guy boy that was giving me a song and an answer all the beat's boys number one hits,

[02:26:49.060 --> 02:26:49.980]
etc and so on.

[02:26:50.020 --> 02:26:52.080]
Well, I mean if you're going to go based on the charts,

[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:53.800]
And then he's don't need it.

[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:53.960]
Huh?

[02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:55.060]
It's don't mean it.

[02:26:55.060 --> 02:26:58.420]
And then he told me that Elvis Presley was better than the Beach Boys Aero Smith.

[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:04.180]
And I like Elvis.

[02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:06.200]
I like most of his music like I've said before.

[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:07.480]
I don't have a blow up doll.

[02:27:07.660 --> 02:27:09.580]
I will not be going to Graceland any time this year.

[02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:10.560]
It's not my agenda.

[02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:15.380]
But I mean, again, it's the most ludicrous comparison.

[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:18.740]
It's like saying that Elvis Presley was better than Fats Domino.

[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:21.920]
What?

[02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:22.620]
No way.

[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:23.540]
Not even in the same.

[02:27:23.620 --> 02:27:24.080]
I can't agree.

[02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:26.300]
Fats Domino is sensational.

[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:28.360]
One of the all-time best in the originator.

[02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:29.740]
No Beach Boys, by the way.

[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:31.500]
Here's Miami.

[02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:31.840]
Hello.

[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:32.640]
Hey, Neil.

[02:27:32.900 --> 02:27:33.200]
Yes, sir.

[02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:36.180]
I have to agree partially with George.

[02:27:37.260 --> 02:27:38.660]
This way it goes.

[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:39.160]
Yeah.

[02:27:39.420 --> 02:27:39.960]
Beach Boys.

[02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:42.740]
Then Marvin Gaye.

[02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:43.780]
Then Elvis Presley.

[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:44.720]
Then Aero Smith.

[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:45.720]
Yeah.

[02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:46.400]
Aero Smith.

[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:47.380]
Early Aero Smith.

[02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:50.560]
All he did was copy the stones and Aero Smith sucks.

[02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:52.700]
They have nothing to do with the rolling stone.

[02:27:52.700 --> 02:27:53.600]
Oh, they were America.

[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:56.380]
They tried to be America's little version of the rolling stones.

[02:27:56.380 --> 02:27:57.980]
It's the way he did not.

[02:27:58.220 --> 02:28:00.980]
Even his stage, you know, whatever.

[02:28:01.260 --> 02:28:02.600]
I don't say you tried to act like me.

[02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:02.840]
Why?

[02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:03.820]
Because he's got big lips.

[02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:05.760]
So that means he was trying to be Mick Jack.

[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:07.020]
No, he tried to move like him.

[02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:07.980]
He tried to think like him.

[02:28:08.280 --> 02:28:09.640]
I don't agree with you.

[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:10.980]
Neil, you're wrong.

[02:28:11.300 --> 02:28:11.520]
OK.

[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:15.260]
He's wrong, sir.

[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:18.120]
I have the buzzer.

[02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:23.120]
Open line today 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line.

[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:27.080]
I mean, and again, like the stones OK.

[02:28:27.220 --> 02:28:28.200]
Would that concert this weekend?

[02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:31.580]
The stones, you know, geriatric tour in sunrise.

[02:28:32.540 --> 02:28:34.880]
As they come out with the walkers and the canes

[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:37.240]
and they'll be wheeling them out there and all of the, you know,

[02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:40.200]
if that's what you like more power to you, you're living in the past.

[02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:46.540]
But again, to compare the rolling stones with arrow smith.

[02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:47.820]
To me, it's laughable.

[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:48.600]
It's ridiculous.

[02:28:48.900 --> 02:28:49.380]
It's a joke.

[02:28:51.420 --> 02:28:55.880]
Newly like comparing a saline Dion with the dusty Springfield.

[02:28:58.560 --> 02:28:59.940]
Canes must match you by the way.

[02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:02.700]
I think Ann Marie still got it.

[02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:03.960]
Here's a mobile and four lot of Dale.

[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:04.200]
Hello.

[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:05.580]
Yeah, hi Neil.

[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:09.100]
What did you get hit by a puck last night?

[02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:10.240]
George is right.

[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:13.060]
Where do you get bubble gum music from the Beach Boys?

[02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:14.420]
They're both great bands.

[02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:15.240]
Where do I get it?

[02:29:15.780 --> 02:29:17.140]
Yeah, right out of the TV.

[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:21.660]
It's a light, light music.

[02:29:21.880 --> 02:29:23.160]
It's not like, I love it.

[02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:23.740]
Don't get me wrong.

[02:29:23.860 --> 02:29:25.760]
I like the music, but it's not serious music.

[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:29.560]
Well, yeah, and of course the arrow smith made a song called paint.

[02:29:29.740 --> 02:29:30.600]
That's a real serious.

[02:29:30.660 --> 02:29:31.500]
That was a piece of crap.

[02:29:31.980 --> 02:29:34.780]
Well, I just like Pokemon.

[02:29:34.780 --> 02:29:35.560]
Do you like Pokemon?

[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:37.860]
No, not really.

[02:29:38.180 --> 02:29:38.780]
No, there you go.

[02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:39.480]
No, no, no.

[02:29:39.620 --> 02:29:43.760]
You name me any group, any artists that never made a clunker and I'll listen.

[02:29:44.260 --> 02:29:44.460]
Right.

[02:29:44.580 --> 02:29:46.860]
I mean, anybody's capable of a clunker.

[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:51.460]
But you judge an arrow smith by pink rhymes with no, not not not not all.

[02:29:51.580 --> 02:29:52.040]
I'm just saying.

[02:29:52.280 --> 02:29:52.940]
So what does that mean?

[02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:55.600]
Beach Boys were real great, feel good music.

[02:29:55.620 --> 02:29:59.000]
Some serious answers, but that was almost as serious.

[02:29:59.660 --> 02:30:00.820]
What was serious?

[02:30:00.940 --> 02:30:02.000]
Name a serious song?

[02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:03.560]
Oh, what?

[02:30:05.060 --> 02:30:06.480]
Oh, yeah, this vibration.

[02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:09.820]
Thank you too many too many nights listening to air in summers.

[02:30:09.820 --> 02:30:11.060]
I think it's your problem, sir.

[02:30:12.040 --> 02:30:12.800]
Good vibrations.

[02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:13.520]
My ass.

[02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:17.320]
Or your round breaking history making.

[02:30:18.680 --> 02:30:20.200]
Got the Beatles on the phone calling.

[02:30:20.480 --> 02:30:21.680]
You know something thinking they're cool.

[02:30:21.820 --> 02:30:24.160]
The Beatles were doing mushrooms again at the time.

[02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:25.420]
Let me just tell you this.

[02:30:25.540 --> 02:30:27.860]
Good vibrations isn't even one of their better songs.

[02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:31.900]
Okay, it's not like.

[02:30:31.900 --> 02:30:33.720]
Like I'm just on this one CD.

[02:30:35.360 --> 02:30:36.400]
409 is good vibration.

[02:30:36.620 --> 02:30:37.640]
This good is 409.

[02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:39.180]
No as good as God only knows.

[02:30:39.220 --> 02:30:41.220]
No, here's the song that wasn't even a hit.

[02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:45.760]
Okay, wasn't even a hit that they get that they gave the Jan and Dean who couldn't

[02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:49.280]
sing the way out of a paper box and Brian Wilson and then Mike love wrote most of the music

[02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:50.080]
for Jan and Dean.

[02:30:50.500 --> 02:30:54.620]
Here's the song that was ripped off under a sidewalk surf and was the name by Jan and Dean.

[02:30:55.360 --> 02:30:56.360]
Get your way.

[02:30:57.200 --> 02:30:57.720]
Great.

[02:30:58.540 --> 02:31:02.400]
It was like on the beach side of Beachwood or your school or something like that.

[02:31:04.040 --> 02:31:04.560]
Great.

[02:31:05.200 --> 02:31:07.200]
A million times better than that.

[02:31:07.460 --> 02:31:08.040]
Good bye, great.

[02:31:08.920 --> 02:31:09.100]
Yes.

[02:31:09.500 --> 02:31:10.560]
Well, we don't stop.

[02:31:10.760 --> 02:31:11.920]
10 million times good.

[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:19.280]
You've battled out, turned around and raised and baby.

[02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:22.800]
That's all there is to the combined grace you got to.

[02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:23.300]
All right.

[02:31:23.740 --> 02:31:25.720]
I just heard my daughter.

[02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:28.700]
Oh, by the way, speaking of Jan and Dean.

[02:31:34.780 --> 02:31:35.520]
It's on here.

[02:31:36.020 --> 02:31:36.660]
Wait a minute.

[02:31:38.540 --> 02:31:39.980]
Talk about a flagrant rip off.

[02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:42.260]
It's not like they stole it.

[02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:45.660]
They just gave him the music and they said, okay, here try and do something with this.

[02:31:45.680 --> 02:31:45.900]
Okay?

[02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:49.160]
You four bastards because one of you are going to be in a real bad car crash and you need the

[02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:49.640]
money.

[02:31:51.080 --> 02:31:51.820]
Tell us.

[02:31:58.340 --> 02:31:59.700]
Oh, see you.

[02:31:59.780 --> 02:32:01.780]
I just tried to do that photo.

[02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:07.140]
That's the worst you ever heard your life.

[02:32:08.940 --> 02:32:10.620]
Maybe what do I got to car crash?

[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:12.200]
Oh, I just said that.

[02:32:13.860 --> 02:32:14.900]
You can't.

[02:32:14.900 --> 02:32:14.900]

[02:32:14.900 --> 02:32:24.900]
When you got to go that's not your view.

[02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:28.220]
You'll probably feed it if you get serious.

[02:32:28.460 --> 02:32:29.000]
Try to suit.

[02:32:29.720 --> 02:32:29.740]
Choose.

[02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:30.000]
It is.

[02:32:30.860 --> 02:32:31.300]
Man.

[02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:33.880]
Could they sing or what that Jan and Dean, huh?

[02:32:36.100 --> 02:32:37.100]
Here's four latter day.

[02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:37.340]
Hello?

[02:32:38.040 --> 02:32:38.680]
Hi, Neil.

[02:32:38.860 --> 02:32:39.180]
Yes, sir.

[02:32:39.400 --> 02:32:41.700]
Yeah, I was calling about the beach boy state.

[02:32:41.700 --> 02:32:46.540]
yes i think that uh... they were pretty influential on the right yes

[02:32:46.540 --> 02:32:48.220]
uh... in the middle of the day

[02:32:48.220 --> 02:32:51.680]
i'm not doubting that they were influential that they were great that they

[02:32:51.680 --> 02:32:53.600]
were like uh... all of these things

[02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:54.980]
that make a more important

[02:32:55.680 --> 02:32:59.860]
i'm not discussing who's more important discussing whose music was better

[02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:02.580]
sir

[02:33:02.580 --> 02:33:04.080]
yeah i'm still here

[02:33:04.080 --> 02:33:04.280]
yeah

[02:33:04.280 --> 02:33:07.680]
i don't think that i'll smith music is very important

[02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:09.140]
i mean influence

[02:33:09.140 --> 02:33:11.280]
air is not an important group

[02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:13.720]
arosmith is a groundbreaking group

[02:33:13.720 --> 02:33:14.900]
groundbreaking yes

[02:33:14.900 --> 02:33:18.380]
what song is this groundbreaking all of the early songs were groundbreaking

[02:33:18.380 --> 02:33:20.320]
you name them

[02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:23.580]
all the early songs what are the that was what one album to album

[02:33:23.580 --> 02:33:24.180]
and

[02:33:24.180 --> 02:33:27.860]
i think that the beach boys had more than that

[02:33:27.860 --> 02:33:29.660]
yeah and then and let me ask you this

[02:33:29.660 --> 02:33:32.880]
since since you know i mean again i shouldn't be on the defense of because i

[02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:33.520]
like the beach boys

[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:36.680]
but like surf in safari surfer girl surf in u.s.a

[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:39.060]
do you want to dance uh... dance dance

[02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:42.720]
you can take all of these different records and you can take ninety percent

[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:45.180]
of them can get them down to the same three songs

[02:33:47.020 --> 02:33:48.700]
they were groundbreaking and

[02:33:48.700 --> 02:33:53.180]
i think they're not you're not responding to what i just said because you know

[02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:53.680]
it's true

[02:33:53.680 --> 02:33:57.420]
and i like every one of the song ninety nine percent other than coke a

[02:33:57.420 --> 02:33:57.580]
mall

[02:33:57.580 --> 02:34:01.060]
i don't think the beach boys ever made a record i didn't like ninety eight percent

[02:34:01.060 --> 02:34:01.840]
i liked okay

[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:03.900]
but the most of them were the same

[02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:06.900]
i understand that

[02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:08.660]
yeah i mean i understand a lot of music

[02:34:08.660 --> 02:34:12.320]
so what they're going to create a bunch of volume of album

[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:15.860]
they started making music with different types of instruments and

[02:34:15.860 --> 02:34:17.400]
right changing the face of music

[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:21.060]
i understand that but i'm talking about the music itself

[02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:23.540]
i'm not you know how about less polonry for

[02:34:25.060 --> 02:34:26.240]
that's before by time

[02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:27.620]
okay thank you

[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:32.540]
how about gogi grand in the wayward wind with the phasing huh and say you know

[02:34:32.540 --> 02:34:33.820]
you're laughing but i'm serious

[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:38.440]
that was one of the first right of the big hurt by Tony Fisher those were some

[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:40.980]
of the earliest records where they did phasing and music

[02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:44.420]
but you know

[02:34:44.420 --> 02:34:48.700]
anybody here know about less polonry for it no but let's talk about other than us

[02:34:49.700 --> 02:34:50.100]
no

[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:52.440]
but they're all music experts

[02:34:54.140 --> 02:34:55.300]
and let me say it again

[02:34:55.300 --> 02:34:57.480]
surfe i mean you can look down the list

[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.160]
ninety five percent of them are the same

[02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:02.760]
song will have

[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:04.200]
give you that

[02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:07.200]
like i said 78 percent

[02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:09.640]
thirty three

[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:11.700]
forty five rpm

[02:35:11.700 --> 02:35:14.240]
why are you airing like this

[02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:15.320]
long

[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:17.820]
it is a thing

[02:35:17.820 --> 02:35:21.800]
it's a thing

[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:23.640]
it's a thing

[02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:28.120]
somebody

[02:35:39.060 --> 02:35:39.060]

[02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:41.560]
happy

[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:41.560]

[02:35:57.100 --> 02:35:58.060]
I'm sorry.

[02:35:59.020 --> 02:35:59.960]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:00.380 --> 02:36:00.820]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:01.900]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:01.900 --> 02:36:01.900]

[02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:02.160]

[02:36:02.340 --> 02:36:02.620]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:04.660]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:05.220 --> 02:36:05.300]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:05.300 --> 02:36:05.300]

[02:36:05.300 --> 02:36:05.300]

[02:36:05.300 --> 02:36:05.300]

[02:36:05.300 --> 02:36:05.300]

[02:36:05.300 --> 02:36:05.300]

[02:36:05.300 --> 02:36:05.300]

[02:36:05.300 --> 02:36:05.600]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:06.300]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:07.500]

[02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:07.800]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:07.940 --> 02:36:07.980]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:07.980 --> 02:36:08.200]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:09.400]

[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:10.240]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:12.280]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:14.260]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:18.220]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:19.580 --> 02:36:20.020]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:20.020 --> 02:36:20.580]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:25.200]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:27.000]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:28.360]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:28.580 --> 02:36:28.980]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:30.880]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:32.400]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:36.260]
Okay, 145 at 560 WQM.

[02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:37.840]
So we've decided Elvis is like what?

[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:38.520]
Down on the list.

[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:39.060]
Wait down there.

[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:39.960]
Wait down.

[02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:41.240]
We'd like Elvis.

[02:36:41.540 --> 02:36:42.200]
He's okay.

[02:36:42.460 --> 02:36:43.320]
But he's down on the list.

[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:46.860]
Two open lines in date 5 6 7 0 5 60.

[02:36:46.860 --> 02:36:48.420]

He's down on the list.

He's down on the list.

[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:05.080]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:05.320]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:08.060]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:08.060 --> 02:38:10.140]
He's down on the list.

He's down on the list.

[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:27.380]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:27.380 --> 02:38:27.380]

[02:38:27.380 --> 02:38:28.220]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:28.220 --> 02:38:29.520]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:29.840]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:30.760]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:32.060]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:32.060 --> 02:38:32.660]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:33.360]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:34.140]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:34.140 --> 02:38:35.220]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:37.480]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:39.180]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:39.340 --> 02:38:41.240]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:45.460 --> 02:38:46.620]
He's down on the list.

[02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:51.780]
I've been playing music a long time and Steve, when we were in high school, we had those

[02:38:51.780 --> 02:38:52.300]
mixers.

[02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:58.580]
He used to do the Mick Jagger thing a long time ago, but he got teased a lot and everything.

[02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:00.360]
He's a really great guy.

[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:04.940]
As far as the comparison, there is not yet.

[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:06.960]
It's ridiculous.

[02:39:07.240 --> 02:39:07.700]
Okay, hang on.

[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:09.780]
George, I'll give you the address and you can zip it over here.

[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:10.100]
Yeah.

[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:11.040]
And the picture is too.

[02:39:11.820 --> 02:39:13.620]
Okay, we have an open line in date 56670560.

[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:18.620]
Here's a crawl springs.

[02:39:18.700 --> 02:39:18.880]
Hello.

[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:20.880]
Yeah, guys.

[02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:26.000]
I don't know what George has been eating for lunch, but I don't know.

[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:27.640]
He's about the beach boys.

[02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:29.580]
They're kids music.

[02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:31.900]
They have no content to beach boys.

[02:39:32.060 --> 02:39:32.440]
Yeah, hard.

[02:39:32.580 --> 02:39:36.720]
You know, great harmonies and you know, and it's like there's been a chipmunk roll.

[02:39:37.380 --> 02:39:38.520]
They have nothing to say.

[02:39:38.700 --> 02:39:40.720]
The chipmunks add a little bit slower RPM.

[02:39:40.860 --> 02:39:42.560]
They're like the chipmunks at 42 RPM.

[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:43.080]
That's right.

[02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:45.940]
They were great, but the chipmunks, good comparison.

[02:39:46.140 --> 02:39:46.480]
I like that.

[02:39:46.740 --> 02:39:47.520]
I like that.

[02:39:47.900 --> 02:39:51.960]
You know, they have little content in their music there.

[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:55.020]
And I like Marvin Biggay because you know, it gets me late.

[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:55.740]
Okay.

[02:39:58.080 --> 02:39:59.880]
Well, there's Marvin Gaye.

[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:04.540]
Oh, you're comparing the beat twice with this.

[02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:07.100]
I can't believe it.

[02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:16.820]
He's going back to that same stupid crap.

[02:40:16.820 --> 02:40:18.720]
We're not understanding about that.

[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:20.600]
About writers, about Bach and Beethoven.

[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:24.160]
We're talking about singers, people who made music.

[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:26.020]
Who were still mal music.

[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:27.120]
They follow instruction.

[02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:28.540]
They make music.

[02:40:28.700 --> 02:40:28.880]
Okay.

[02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:30.620]
You can have all the instructions in the world.

[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:33.640]
Unless you've got the vocal abilities, you can give the same.

[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:35.020]
You could give Jan and Dean.

[02:40:35.020 --> 02:40:36.140]
There's a classic example.

[02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:37.900]
The same music is Brian Wilson.

[02:40:38.320 --> 02:40:41.760]
And they still can't make music because they can't sing.

[02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:43.380]
And you could give.

[02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:44.640]
Here's a good example.

[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:46.900]
You could give Ricky Martin with all the respect.

[02:40:47.100 --> 02:40:47.940]
How good they made him look.

[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:48.580]
How they did that.

[02:40:48.620 --> 02:40:49.420]
I only wish I knew.

[02:40:49.720 --> 02:40:52.060]
You could give him the same music as they give to Luis Miguel.

[02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:52.500]
Okay.

[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:55.660]
And I'm sure his Spanish is impeccable, almost as good as his English.

[02:40:56.740 --> 02:40:59.600]
Could Ricky Martin make the same music that Luis Miguel makes?

[02:40:59.760 --> 02:40:59.940]
No.

[02:41:00.180 --> 02:41:00.300]
No.

[02:41:00.740 --> 02:41:00.920]
Yeah.

[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:07.580]
I feel so weak.

[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:08.520]
I feel just so.

[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:09.820]
That's what I was thinking of.

[02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:09.940]
Week.

[02:41:10.580 --> 02:41:11.060]
The both of them.

[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:11.480]
Week.

[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:13.320]
Luis Miguel is weak.

[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:14.820]
He's got a good voice.

[02:41:15.820 --> 02:41:17.260]
But he'd be nothing without songwriters.

[02:41:17.900 --> 02:41:18.700]
What would he say?

[02:41:19.340 --> 02:41:22.400]
If you ever saw Luis Miguel in concert, which you won because you're a hard-hearted

[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:22.800]
speaker.

[02:41:22.940 --> 02:41:24.060]
I saw clips of it.

[02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:24.560]
No, no, no.

[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:26.100]
If you ever saw him live.

[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:27.240]
Like you were right there.

[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:28.600]
Like I was three different times.

[02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:29.860]
Once in Vegas and twice here.

[02:41:30.220 --> 02:41:35.580]
And you saw him sing and sing everything perfectly and never miss a note and just do things

[02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:37.620]
with his voice that nobody could dream of doing.

[02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:39.900]
You wouldn't be saying all these things.

[02:41:40.580 --> 02:41:41.960]
You wouldn't even be thinking.

[02:41:42.060 --> 02:41:42.780]
All of these things.

[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:43.080]
Right.

[02:41:43.620 --> 02:41:45.900]
But you're just saying it to be a little Ojón provocador.

[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:46.440]
Yeah, sure.

[02:41:46.460 --> 02:41:46.920]
Yeah, right.

[02:41:47.100 --> 02:41:49.640]
You're not fooling us because nobody's that dumb.

[02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:51.620]
Here is the Fort Lauderdale.

[02:41:51.740 --> 02:41:51.880]
Hello.

[02:41:54.260 --> 02:41:55.140]
Fort Lauderdale.

[02:41:55.900 --> 02:41:56.720]
Neil God.

[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:57.380]
Yes, sir.

[02:41:57.380 --> 02:42:02.100]
Yeah, I kind of agree with the call that was saying that the beach voice were more influential.

[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:05.240]
But I mean, as far as something I like personally, harassment.

[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:05.840]
Yeah.

[02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:09.220]
But if you want to get to the root of where they come from.

[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:09.940]
Let's get to the root.

[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:11.780]
Yeah, listen to their own words.

[02:42:11.940 --> 02:42:16.800]
Steven Tyler and Joe Perry admit that what they are a knockoff of is of Led Zeppelin.

[02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:17.260]
Yeah.

[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:18.080]
That's all they are.

[02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:20.240]
Well, okay, that I can handle, but not the Rolling Stones.

[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:23.740]
Oh, well, the Rolling Stones, of course, they made their influence too.

[02:42:23.820 --> 02:42:24.680]
But now you're right.

[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:26.200]
They're walking around and walkers are there.

[02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:29.400]
And if you want to listen, you want to listen to some real ass kicking stuff.

[02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:29.880]
Yeah.

[02:42:30.380 --> 02:42:31.140]
Let's have them, man.

[02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:31.640]
Okay.

[02:42:31.860 --> 02:42:32.080]
All right.

[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:32.540]
So yeah.

[02:42:32.980 --> 02:42:34.540]
Okay, here's a medley of their hit, by the way.

[02:42:35.140 --> 02:42:37.340]
And you know what we're forgetting in the midst of all of this?

[02:42:37.620 --> 02:42:41.640]
More influential today than all the groups that have been mentioned put together.

[02:42:43.620 --> 02:42:44.020]
Yeah.

[02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:45.740]
Come on, let's hear it.

[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:47.180]
Get ready for tonight at the Master Ray.

[02:42:47.180 --> 02:42:47.580]
Come on.

[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:48.420]
Let's go.

[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:50.380]
This is it.

[02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:52.160]
Forget about the Beast Boys.

[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:55.060]
Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, the Thone.

[02:42:55.060 --> 02:42:57.160]
Forget about all these mediocre groups, okay?

[02:42:57.500 --> 02:42:58.680]
Let's get with the heavy-duty stuff.

[02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:00.080]
Heavy-duty.

[02:43:00.460 --> 02:43:00.820]
Come on.

[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:02.340]
It's only a four-hour show.

[02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:02.840]
Let's go.

[02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:07.500]
Oh, listen to that.

[02:43:09.140 --> 02:43:10.300]
Rosie and the original.

[02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:13.300]
She'll be the sour, sour, old.

[02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:16.860]
And oh, God.

[02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:17.800]
I'm crazy.

[02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:22.560]
Oh, God.

[02:43:24.020 --> 02:43:25.020]
Oh, God.

[02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:40.240]
Oh, God.

[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:42.640]
Oh, God.

[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:47.740]
Thank you.
