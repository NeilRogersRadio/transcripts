croaks and then mister spot he's not feeling good

[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.560]
and then we got another jackass so with this deal about teaching the kids

[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.840]
and not not that learning or succeeding is important but feel good about

[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.960]
yourself so even if you're a moron did you see that piece last night

[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.640]

[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.700]
miniscule is that and my point being here's four people that we don't even

[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.780]
know the names of these people probably never will

[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.500]
i wouldn't be surprised if maybe at least three of those four maybe all four

[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.640]
pretty dang good people

[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.260]
uh... decent people never still afraid train probably weren't born with a silver

[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.560]
spoon stuck in there that doesn't have two hundred million dollars in the bank

by the way bill of rift on cnbc this morning was due to peace from Atlantic City

[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.060]
from soon some just re-open newly refurbished

[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.740]
casino and it was putting in a quarter

[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.860]
for the other year for suhara and the david the whatever's name is there

[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.620]
i can ever think of his name what's his name the little one on the you don't

[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.520]
watch the nbc because you haven't got a stock

[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.000]
but anyway you put you don't put a quarter in the slot machine

[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.960]
because uh... it was one of those things were that if you

[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.920]
put in the all three quarters of all three dollars in a dollar machine

[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.560]
the third one is the one that trips the wheel at the top or something like that

[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.020]
i hate when i see assholes doing that

[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.760]
in vegas you see that all the time these idiots

[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.420]
they're wondering why the thing never comes in for the wheel of fortune for example on the

[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.920]
slot machine it doesn't come and won't come up for unless you put in all three

[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.800]
coins you idiot

[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.740]
what's the sense of playing the machine you're not going to hit anything

[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.840]
unless you put in all the coins it's that maybe like in one case you got three

[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.200]
quarters plopped out

[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.140]
they plopped out

[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.440]
got him i wound up to that have no idea why because i had a

[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.300]
disastrous weekend all men that i have a dark weekend

[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.900]
here's Miami hello

[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.120]
yes sir did you see twenty twenty last night yes i did about the college

[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.320]
fraternity thing i missed that i saw the one with the kids that didn't they didn't

[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.520]
want to pursue competition right that was the last segment yeah

[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.220]
living in the wrong country to be doing something like that that this country is

[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.660]
all about competition the world is about

[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.860]
exactly and that we have to pat everybody on the head say oh you're great

[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.020]
you're wonderful you know i mean how about somebody is ugly do we have to tell

[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.220]
them that they're beautiful to make them feel better according to that piece i think

[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.400]
you do and uh... this guy this guy is dangerous people i can use another doctor

[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.020]
spock

[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.180]
yeah i don't understand that these kids are being let on set up for fall because

[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.600]
in the real world when it turned right it turned eighteen

[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.560]
they need me to get a job flipping burgers and McDonald's those kids

[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.540]
now and i don't understand what what's what's the reasoning i never got the

[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.720]
reasoning behind us what is it was to do so they're supposed to make them feel

[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.080]
better about themselves so that nobody feels inferior and nobody has this

[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.680]
complex but in the meantime they're so stupid as hell you know

[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.800]
well it's kind of like one step beyond social promotion

[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.740]
it must have been a real bleeding heart liberal that would be yeah

[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.580]
i mean exactly not so not only do we move you along even if you're an

[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.020]
idiot every year but also we tell you how wonderful you are for being a moron

[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.660]
oh my god right uh... this is just remember one thing pal that the american

[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.360]
way

[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:27.060]
have a great thing so he didn't see the first segment on to i'm gonna say something

[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.040]
else besides the fact i'm already burned out on football you know it's a hundred

[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.820]
twenty degrees in the shade how can anybody would have brain be thinking about

[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.820]
football right now

[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.380]
it was to a hockey show huh that would fit right in

[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.660]
hundred and forty eight degrees i just don't get it these none they're not one

[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.400]
dimension learn on the mention of the little kids he was talking about

[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.860]
but anyway even more grotesque than that our college fraternities i've always felt

[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.420]
that way

[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:56.040]
not just hazing a college fraternities college fraternities should be banned

[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.340]
from every college campus in america now

[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.640]
well what what is joining some elite group of snobs of of assholes who want to

[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.600]
see if they who could be the biggest group of assholes on campus what does that

[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.300]
have to do with learning which is what you're supposed to be doing when you go to

[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.920]
college besides rickidle out of beer

[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.100]
which is kid last night drank too much booze and beer and guess what he's dead

[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.260]
at m it no less not at some horseball college like uh... you know michigan

[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:27.940]
or michigan state like i went to but no at m it at this institution of

[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.480]
blue nose brown noses of higher learning where they still act like a bunch of

[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.900]
barbarians because going off to college in america

[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.780]
means getting drunk and getting laid a lot don't forget the factory

[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.400]
okay well you want to do the show today i know i have a good

[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.780]
pretty good what

[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.500]
not all right you're right

[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.020]
you want to play in a lot of time i don't know why i don't understand why

[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.960]
maybe it's all those drugs in it this week and you said before

[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.200]
good balance yeah

[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.620]
so anyway ban fraternities now before it's too late and of course the fact that

[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.800]
this kid happened to be a real good looking bright kid naturally we like that

[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.820]
better people have been ugly most of us will just said you know time it doesn't

[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:14.680]
but he was like uh... standout i mean he was like uh... just great looking

[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.240]
all american brilliant with this wonderful future just ask his parents who are

[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.180]
under grieving last night rightfully so

[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.580]
and he goes off he's an m it five weeks

[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.140]
five weeks

[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.440]
and he's dead

[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.400]
and then the response to the lawsuit they filed against the fraternity is the

[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.840]
a chapter they they just disbanded so they'd like uh... they all went away you

[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.820]
know that was a response they just bandit

[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.600]
you know they they they like the kids in the room they force them to drink

[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.720]
x amount in other words you know if you want to get in the here you're going to

[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.200]
have to drink this amount and uh... if you got out all over place or you're out

[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.580]
and then he starts he pay passes out starts puking and so they take them

[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.800]
downstairs in a basement put them on a sofa and leave for a while

[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.720]
and he chokes on his own puking they go back down in his purple and they rush

[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.160]
into hospital and these brain didn't finally have to pull the plug and he's dead

[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.980]
eighteen or nineteen-year-old kid at m it

[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.620]
and of course the assholes who have been in fraternity see fraternities are to

[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.400]
those who were a part of them just like the college football mentality

[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.200]
the same thing somehow having gone to school at

[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:28.520]
and a blank noted game michigan state indiana michigan wherever was i mean this

[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.820]
becomes bigger than life itself

[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.900]
of course down here we have an even worse problem that we have a bunch of

[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.520]
overgrown children who have even went to you of them which are probably lucky

[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.620]
for that but uh... who are into the whole this hercune thing

[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.680]
which makes less than no sense

[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.540]
you see just like this other piece that they had at the end of the guy was

[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.360]
talking about before about the little kids supposedly feeling better about

[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.700]
themselves i know it comes into great shock but when you go off to college

[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.460]
you're having a good time is fine but you're supposed to learn something

[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.680]
there that's the purpose of it

[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.500]
not as kind of a precursor to a little bit of it's kind of like the young

[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.260]
people here the young yentos who are in training

[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.360]
why i to one i t i call me it's yentos and training

[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.740]
yeah who are practicing for their later years when it can be condo

[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.480]
commandos and it's the same thing with his college fraternities

[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.480]
all one day we can be a member of the elx the american forgin the foreign legion

[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.080]
the koanas all of these other horseball groups

[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.360]
and anybody who's ever seen the kind of activities that have been a lot of

[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.040]
movies about them of course a lot of these uh... soft and more movies

[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.360]
about the crap that goes on at college fraternities we know what they are

[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.860]
that's a great club you more on right a lot of excuses for everybody to get

[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.280]
another underwear get naked grab each other's parts kind of like uh... football

[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:44.540]
yeah or guys hang around shower together and grab each other around the uh...

[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.080]
groin by the way did you were you were the fact that most football players don't

[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:50.380]
work out

[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.700]
no what you learn something today

[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.600]
this year is the hundred and twenty fifth anniversary of the bike out of the

[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.880]
out of the back of the back of the actually was originally invented because of

[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.380]
biker's on the a cobblestone roads you know

[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.800]
all man there would go all the time

[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.940]
not real good for the nads

[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:10.560]
original a reason that the jobstrap's were invented in the first place now hockey

[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.140]
players were jockstrap's

[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.520]
if i get this wrong let's see i'm trying to think is it baseball i say i should

[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.440]
put the article out

[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.500]
is it based no baseball players especially catchers they were jockstrap's but

[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.880]
not football players not most

[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:29.380]
i saw put in child straps on who football play well let's find out

[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.340]
what do you mean you saw them putting you're talking about in high school

[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.480]
sure i'm talking about college in professional football players professional

[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.500]
look it up in the book

[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.860]
corning this article and it's written by people who uh... know their jocks

[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.380]
real football players don't wear jockstrap's

[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.040]
because it's restrictive

[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.300]
and they like it in the good foot in the crotch it makes them feel like a real man

[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.540]
will find out let's ask about the name you know

[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.620]
now it may seem a word jockstrap's because there's a bunch of panties basically

[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.820]
no more fraternities left here in the outlaw and ban them right now

like to go out of town during the summer months do not go

[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.780]
to trotto ontario canada the last weekend in july

[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.600]
i forgot

[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.960]
i forgot it was carabana weekend

[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.580]
you know what carabana weekend is

[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:10.020]
it's a weekend where all these dark people all of this come to a town they have

[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.600]
a big parade on their own the lakefront

[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.580]
and uh... they just have hundreds of thousands of farchers who come in uh... for

[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.480]
no particular reason i guess just to be professionals farchers

[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.120]
and i think all of them were staying in my hotel is what i think you know i'm

[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:23.860]
saying uh...

[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.100]
now i just ordinarily i mean the more those people i'm kind of uh... broad-minded

[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.360]
i don't mind a little bit of a mix you know few of these a few of these not

[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.600]
too many sources that makes me uncomfortable like this weekend which is why

[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.820]
i left early yesterday morning instead of coming back last night i hopped on

[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.160]
the earliest plan i could find

[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.260]
and even four thirty in the morning yesterday morning when i went down the

[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.700]
lobby and hotel to catch a can be the airport it was loaded ordinarily at four

[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.860]
thirty in the morning you can't find a dog in a hotel

[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.680]
or any other hotel it was just loaded with farchers what were they doing i you

[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.020]
have to ask them i don't know

[00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:01.060]
i just want to say this and i i realize we have a lot of black people listen to

[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.280]
show at least five or ten

[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:07.140]
but i got to tell you this anybody who could have spent the weekend that i

[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.520]
just spent at least a half a weekend up there

[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:15.140]
in the environment of loud this courteous obnoxious just just grow test

[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:19.700]
holding elevator doors yellow open yelling standing in your way just just

[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.880]
going out of the way to be obnoxious anybody who could have experienced that

[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.940]
and still not be a racist man you've got you'd have to be uh... stronger than

[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:30.520]
hercules you'd have to be more talented than joey car

[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.600]
to be able to survive as an experience like that and i'd say

[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.100]
man old man i mean gets gets a manor is get a brain get the what was that

[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.600]
what was that all about

[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:41.720]
a boot

[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.620]
so that's just my best advice now if you happen to be dark and you like uh... you

[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.140]
know and these were people from the care of being either that i thought

[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.020]
carabana was like you know from all these places the car being originally

[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.660]
what was the concept these were like mostly from the trite

[00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.500]
i mean these were people i left the trite twenty a some years ago twenty

[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.220]
years ago to get away from people like this and these were the people who were

[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.320]
up there were this weekend

[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:11.040]
roudy and loud and obnoxious and disgusting and just uh... abhorrent of their

[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:11.620]
behavior

[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.640]
and just jump in and running in jukin and jive and but nevertheless

[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.040]
and i kept thinking of myself you know if if and and they were also i will say

[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.480]
this there were some black people there who just as offended and appalled by

[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.540]
the behavior of the majority of these people as uh... those of us whiteies

[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.760]
uh... us honkeys were there

[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.560]
they were grossed out and obviously very embarrassed

[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.260]
and i'm thinking of myself you know if you want to get treated like uh... uh...

[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.120]
human being like uh... an ordinary civilized human being how about start

[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.780]
acting like one would be a good idea

[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.820]
just a little bit of courtesy and common sense would be good just tone it down

[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.740]
like about twenty or thirty not just for starters would be great

[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.360]
god

[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.540]
here's a mobile implantation hello

[00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.720]

when to see soft park over the weekend

[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.780]

[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.700]
i've seen the movie and i have no one in yet

[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.160]
i don't know if you're playing on cedar now

[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:17.180]
well anyway i've worked with about twenty people movie theater and uh...

[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:17.840]
all of a sudden

[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.360]
a take comes in

[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.820]
from the broward this is at the in very uh... movie theater

[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.160]
probably can't get any work for you

[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.940]
yeah right uh...

[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.020]
comes in and there's this

[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.240]
grow it must be like seventeen or eighteen years old

[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.720]
i don't know if any of the ratings police that what it was

[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.640]
comes in and yankster out with her friend

[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.180]
and i couldn't believe it

[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:42.900]
and i i i i was about to say

[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:43.920]
there was

[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.700]
you know they they pulled them out i couldn't believe it i i you know i was

[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.800]
is very very strange

[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.900]
yeah i'm on the soft park video i was watching yesterday that's one of the

[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.180]
things that they're talking about is you know making fun of this the

[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.920]
business of you know having all these rated movies and

[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.840]
and censoring movies and video games and all this other crap

[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:06.080]
on the ironic that some poor company and yank some kids out because i

[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.180]
think i'd probably like seventeen and two thirds anyway

[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.500]
they're in two thirds

[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.780]
i mean i thought they were busy reading the strip points

[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.840]
yeah i thought the time for this well that it's nice to know that they're

[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.580]
spreading it around

[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.120]
yeah

[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.340]
um everything is um i went into a uh

[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.880]
into a sushi place

[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.400]
off i can't remember the name and i probably don't want to but they're next to

[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.020]
gold gym

[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.580]
on uh... university in play or sunrise yeah

[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.280]
and i went in there for a second

[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.100]
because i had to use the bathroom to

[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.240]
urinate

[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.760]
and i went in i went in and i said

[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.980]
your bathroom please

[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:38.940]
and

[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.160]
they say they and it's it just there's nobody in the restaurant like six o'clock

[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:43.800]
in the evening

[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.180]
and i

[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.560]
and i'm there and then

[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.040]
there's a like a chinese family held around the reading their dinner whatever

the middle of an all-white uh... whatever might be like on the bus

[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.440]

the problem for the left is the best chance

[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.900]
again in the next two

[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.900]

[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:15.440]

this is a great political wise victory

[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.580]
who outside the hood is just like Hillary

[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:56.860]
a meldically a match up and even for ron for next to Hillary Clinton

[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.300]

[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:22.380]
the book for Hillary Hillary Hillary Hillary Clinton

[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.580]
yeah all right 1025

[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.960]
560 WTQMC people just don't want to understand by the millions

[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:34.280]
I just don't I just can't figure out why it's so difficult to understand

[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:39.260]
they have an arrangement now I realize that we're not supposed to say those

[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.140]
things in America because we live in this ivory tower kind of

[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.480]
allyson wonderland country where everybody is happily married

[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.300]
and it's said or in so on and is everybody happily married who's married no

[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.100]
and are there a lot of people that have got a arrangement

[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:56.460]
will like have their own sex lives and basically do their own thing and even have

[00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.620]
their own circle of friends but they stay married for whatever reason

[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:04.300]
in her case it's political because she's got her aspirations and he's got his

[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.340]
aspirations and they're both getting their own ass evidently

[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.240]
because they haven't slept together in 20 years by all accounts

[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.360]
by those who are sticking their nose in it why is that so hard to understand

[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.880]
they have an arrangement okay so she has to act out raids and indigment

[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.900]
and indigment and she thought he was over this

[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.260]
10 years ago and all this other crap and this is for public consumption

[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:29.060]
these are the things you have to say so she has to concoct this scenario

[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.520]
where well you know he never stole a freight train and he's a wonderful father

[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.940]
and Chelsea isn't as ugly as everybody thinks

[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:39.120]
etc and so on all she is as ugly as everybody thinks but nevertheless

[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.840]
she's the one responsible for that because Chelsea's got her hair like she used to have it

[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:47.880]
back before she became rich and famous and a hot shot politician

[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:52.100]
they got an arrangement what's wrong with that i bet you there are plenty of people

[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:55.380]
in this audience right now and i know you won't call because we don't have a voice

[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:59.240]
writer unfortunately if it was a real radio station like we used to have an i.o.d

[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.740]
we'd have a voice writer and people could call in and say yeah my wife and i've been married

[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:07.440]
for 40 years and we haven't done it in 25 years and she screws her guys and i do my uh

[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.540]
whatever you know and i said it's an arrangement

[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:14.600]
sometimes couples do that for the children while the children are growing up

[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.740]
and then sometimes we even want to children our adults for whatever other reasons they do it

[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.440]
for appearance sake or for uh because they whatever who the hell cares

[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:31.000]
here's a lady in Miami hello hi you know i guess you know you'd have watched that um

[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.200]
molotto woman sold that o'Brien on ms mbc she's molotto oh yeah well what it was

[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:43.000]
was she not a molotto she's black she's no it's no it's not so that o'Brien isn't black she's

[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.980]
Hispanic she's like uh i don't know what she is she's not black she's a molotto

[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.580]
she's a molotter

[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.500]
well what color is she like light pink i don't know what i mean like some

[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:59.880]
some white or shade of pale i don't know anyway that whatever but um i've seen or should i make

[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:12.960]
make uh duty on the floor when i see her right i do too because i always thought she was just a

[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:18.600]
inferiority because she referred to that mass killer in Atlanta as the late what was his name

[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:24.320]
something Burke she says uh we're not going to interview uh the friends of the late uh Eric

[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:30.200]
Burke or whatever his name was no mark mark her and she made sound like he was a notable and then

[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:36.400]
she referred to him uh Barton not not Burke here i even marked Barton his name was Mark

[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.900]
Barton i don't even want to know that jerk's name okay the late Mark O'Barton yes

[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:46.280]
and she says and she and then she refers to him as the gentleman you know the

[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:50.720]
couple they want all they all do that in the media you know or the alleged killer or you know

[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.560]
stuff like that they all pull like her well she's just a uh pimplehead but why does she have so

[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:00.320]
much air time because she's on msnbc just like why does John Gibson have so much air time because

[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:06.100]
they work cheap i guess god it was so and and uh she didn't even get the back straight she says

[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:10.800]
well he allegedly killed on his first life but what about the mother-in-law that he also

[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:18.040]
hacked up now she didn't have i have more facts than she had yeah well she's a pimplehead in fact

[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:22.880]
if you want but you see you're not uh if you pretended to be a molado put on some black face and

[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:28.820]
maybe you can get on there really yeah okay not too dark though yeah really okay i don't know what

[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.940]
else she is other than annoying so let that all brine and of course uh which ties him with that

[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:38.680]
thing about newsweek yeah this week's newsweek the one that's got the sad goodbye on the cover

[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:44.660]
because they more the Kennedys here's Caroline and Ted and Arnold Schwarzenegger and what's your name

[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.480]
there Maria Schriver with no chin and i don't even know who that is in the bottom that's uh i don't

[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:54.400]
know who that is a sad goodbye but anyway it's the obvious two issue of a newsweek so they've got

[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.000]
some letters in response to that piece they had a couple of weeks ago Latin USA with that awful build

[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.460]
wreck article in it about generation inye about a guy trying to make a living uh uh you know fostering

[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:09.320]
something that doesn't even exist and shouldn't wait till you hear these two there are several letters

[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.420]
and most of them of course are hostile toward that whole mentality thank god but the first letter

[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:20.180]
is nauseating and then the second one the balances it out living la vida latina the first one says

[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:23.860]
salute to newsweek for being one of the first majoring west language publications in the US

[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:27.500]
to portray accurately and honestly what it's like to be Latin in this country

[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:32.520]
i'm a generation in ye latina and my parents felt that teaching us Spanish would lead to discrimination

[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.400]
for their children speaking only English did help me to fit in with my anglapirs in school but to

[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.900]
this day i have felt robbed of my heritage because of the overwhelming pressure i faced trying to

[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:47.540]
act white to fit into american society during the 70s and 80s there's that expression again act white

[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:53.260]
oh if only those people in Toronto this weekend would have acted white thanks to mainstream publications

[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:57.040]
like newsweek that choose to celebrate the rise of the Latin population in our country there will

[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.800]
be countless kids who will take pride in their heritage and not feel ashamed of their ethnicity

[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:09.940]
grazia says rene agradano of uh urica california to which i say hi to her now name with hell from

[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:15.360]
cistero illinois because evidently they want to stay alive it says so the rest of america must learn

[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:20.200]
with that to the increasing Hispanic influence in the u.s as a 19 year old white female i find

[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:24.280]
it difficult to be totally optimistic about this trend entire streets in my town have become

[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:29.360]
holy spanish speaking and cater overwhelmingly to the Hispanic community back in my predominantly

[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:33.920]
Hispanic high school the national anthem was often disregarded replaced with chalca viva mehiko

[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:39.080]
and inquiring about potential summer jobs i've been told by employers not to bother applying

[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:44.420]
unless i'm bilingual sound for me here i'm all for preserving and celebrating individual cultures

[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:49.040]
and i honestly love the diversity and ethnic richness of the united states but it's such a terrible

[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.000]
idea for some of them moved to a new country and actually learned the language what happened to

[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.020]
preserving america's culture says name with hell in cistero illinois go and name with hell

[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:05.040]
whoever you are and the couple of other letters to ripping into that bitch christy how beggar

[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:09.040]
mara red her a column about oh disgusting and nauseating about that whole generation any a

[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.880]
business you can have all the culture you want you can eat all the god damn refry beans and all

[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.580]
of horse meat and whatever it had you like i don't care just like the attendants they'd all

[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:22.120]
their pasta they don't even pronounce it right there but you go to with their pursuit and they're

[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.420]
uh... cover cool and all this other because they make some uh... they think they make some sound

[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.540]
Italian and the Italians laugh at them but nevertheless

[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.580]
but that doesn't mean they have to walk around uh... you know mind your mind you talk talking

[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.320]
some forward language in the streets

[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:40.440]
and then like being separate from everybody else this this separate equal thing is is crap that's

[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:40.860]
the problem

[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:47.360]
and that line in there from rene uh... should compel the act white what's wrong with acting like

[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.420]
civilized it's not a question of acting white

[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:54.420]
this plenty of white people a trailer park trash who also don't act white according to what some

[00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:47.010]
I'm gonna leave that little cat away.

[00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:00.470]
Welcome to New York City.

[00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:03.490]
I'm gonna get a car to you and see both of them.

[00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:08.970]
And you'll notice by the way this is having no impact.

[00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:14.530]
Two hours and 40 minutes of Ricky Martin today baby.

[00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:24.690]
I...</p

[00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:25.150]
this is Martin

[00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:27.550]
I just had a clip of my tool

[00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:30.210]
there at the bow on you

[00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:37.730]
I was the woman there, that is Ricky there

[00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:38.710]
that's a man with a few

[00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:40.050]
I was the one there

[00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:40.750]
let's go on a little

[00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:48.010]
I mean, no matter where you turn, you can't get away from Ricky Martin

[00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:51.470]
it's an all-vicky Martin Monday here because we've got no calls, no interest

[00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:54.730]
this is the definitive day of my life

[00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:56.370]
this tells you what this town is all about

[00:57:56.370 --> 00:58:01.110]
last week I was the hero, I was the great white-hold, I was the one voice of sanity

[00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:04.090]
we got the election done, everybody's peeing all over my leg

[00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:06.130]
and I come here on Monday morning and guess what?

[00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:07.490]
hey, screw you baby

[00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:11.250]
okay, so screw this story that was on the front page

[00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:13.170]
I got no thoughts about that because it's too embarrassing

[00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:15.330]
okay, that teenage voice did it with each other

[00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:18.210]
and they don't necessarily have that permission from their parents to be watching

[00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:18.850]
from adults

[00:58:20.810 --> 00:58:23.450]
and the other 8500 things that I talked about this morning

[00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:25.250]
including my weekend with the Carabana Festival

[00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:27.110]
that most of you are too embarrassed to talk about

[00:58:27.110 --> 00:58:29.750]
and in fact we got golf and prime time on ABC tonight

[00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:34.690]
and the affirmative action thing which got all mighty, I hope that I wish this guy all the luck in the world by the way

[00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:37.470]
with this, I'll sign a petition ten times

[00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:38.850]
goodbye to affirmative action

[00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:44.310]
5, 6, 7, 05, 6, 10

[00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:44.910]
are we on the air?

[00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:49.190]
because I noticed that in the bizarre part of part about this is that most morning side coming here

[00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:52.790]
and I take a peek at the phone and the control room while the worst team is on and it's like deadly

[00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:55.070]
maybe there's a call on there maybe not and they're in there

[00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:58.810]
this morning they were loaded, you want to know why because the back of these football nerds are back

[00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:00.950]
they're in a feeding frenzy now

[00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:04.230]
because they actually had a couple of scrimmages so now they're in a feeding frenzy

[00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:07.530]
the people with no lives other than the jocks traps

[00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:10.110]
fine, did we even get a call about that?

[00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:10.690]
no, no

[00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:15.610]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:17.510]
I mean I'm embarrassed, I really am

[00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:20.690]
I'm embarrassed and humiliated for the hypocrisy of this town

[00:59:22.450 --> 00:59:25.010]
people will pretend to care about something, they don't care about anything

[00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:26.390]
they're just mindless

[00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:28.610]
mindless battling rhetoric

[00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:30.850]
where have we heard that before

[00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:33.850]
where have we read that before?

[00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:35.670]
here's a mobile in, what does that say?

[00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:36.570]
in default

[00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:37.990]
how you doing now?

[00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.950]
what is that default?

[00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.790]
default?

[00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:42.710]
put that on there automatic

[00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:44.410]
yes sir go ahead

[00:59:44.410 --> 00:59:45.690]
I do know, okay

[00:59:45.690 --> 00:59:49.290]
oh I just want to thank you for doing your great public service last week

[00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:53.110]
and for the Panther Rally tickets to gaming

[00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:56.250]
to go to Judas Bay 2 and they were going to say thank you for that

[00:59:56.730 --> 00:59:58.610]
and I went to Vegas last week

[00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:01.510]
a great time, great time everybody spending having a great time

[01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:03.510]
and I like this one way of doing things out over here

[01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:05.790]
how was your weekend in Toronto by the way

[01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:06.210]
horrible

[01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:08.870]
yeah I'll spurt you as a man

[01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:10.170]
I'll spurt you as a man

[01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:11.150]
yeah that's incredible

[01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:13.190]
I know who you're slow right?

[01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:15.550]
no no no I only wish

[01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:17.350]
but you rather have who you are slow

[01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:19.390]
well I'm thinking okay I have a great day pal

[01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:22.910]
I'll have to, no I'm not, do I go to Kyoto?

[01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:25.350]
no no I like a few white people around you

[01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:27.330]
just a few to make me feel comfortable

[01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:29.870]
make me feel safe like going to Louise in the Bronx

[01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:31.910]
what?

[01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:34.290]
come on come up out of the water

[01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:38.270]
I am, why you, I don't care what do I care about her ass

[01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:41.070]
okay well great you're excited about her ass

[01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:43.630]
I don't want to see her ass or Ricky Marcus ass

[01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:43.950]
huh?

[01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:47.370]
in fact to be honest with you I'm not into anybody's ass

[01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:49.430]
I mean you guys I don't want to get back on that again

[01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:50.410]
there'll be another 30 grand

[01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:55.610]
5670560, 0560 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:59.090]
dead Monday, remember that song blue Monday by Fats Domino

[01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:00.630]
dead Monday that's it today

[01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:02.970]
Monday August 2 the worst day of my life

[01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:05.730]
so when I started I mentioned it like half an hour ago

[01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:06.930]
we're getting lunch from a bread today

[01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:08.650]
at Tony's but he doesn't know because I want that sausage

[01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:11.030]
with no cheese cut the cheese okay

[01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:12.210]
no more cheese

[01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:15.250]
just some of that sliced sausage with the sauce

[01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:16.990]
and little bit of onions that would be, that was perfect

[01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:19.410]
and he doesn't have to send two pounds of it by the way

[01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:20.590]
just to make him feel a little bit better

[01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:23.110]
why is it that every time these people send me lunch the matter

[01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:25.430]
who it is they always send like three times more than I need

[01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:26.950]
and I sit here and just shovel it down

[01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:28.470]
and shovel it down and shovel it down

[01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:32.870]
here's a mobile in Kendall

[01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:33.730]
hello

[01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:35.490]
Neil yes sir

[01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:38.410]
you went to Toronto I thought they had a lot of uh...

[01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:38.970]
you went up there

[01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:41.010]
and hanging around them

[01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.270]
carabana festival

[01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:44.390]
sir it was all sparts or weekend in Toronto

[01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:46.430]
oh they have that up there too

[01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:47.050]
you know everywhere

[01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:51.590]
and all more just your ordinary pedestrian black people

[01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:54.950]
these were people who went out of their way to be loud and rude and obnoxious

[01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:58.090]
and make you as disgusted as you possibly could just be in their midst

[01:01:58.090 --> 01:01:58.910]
but anyway yes

[01:01:58.910 --> 01:02:00.710]
like the San Francisco gay parade

[01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:02.730]
something like that yeah similar

[01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:08.110]
anyhow uh... once we get anywhere near the season or there's a practice

[01:02:08.110 --> 01:02:11.470]
you know all the dolphins come out of the wood where people have no lives

[01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:13.830]
and that's all they do and all they talk about there

[01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.290]
analizing the dolphins

[01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:16.910]
they're analizing every play

[01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:21.790]
this morning they were complaining that they practiced too far away from the stadiums

[01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:22.470]
where they sit

[01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:25.450]
Jimmy Johnson's going to excuse me

[01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:27.310]
what would you like us to do out here

[01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:29.710]
you know what this reminds me of what it's the five-spon

[01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:31.930]
people call and say they went to panther practice

[01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:33.210]
and i say to myself

[01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:35.190]
do you people have any kind of a life at all

[01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:37.830]
why would anybody go to a practice to a scrimmage

[01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:40.690]
i mean if these people are then impressed and overwhelmed by these

[01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.730]
illiterate morons then they need serious help

[01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:44.590]
well i some of them do that

[01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:46.610]
and by the way they can have a literate morons you see

[01:02:46.610 --> 01:02:49.250]
chrome alone signs for uh... seventeen million years

[01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.670]
oh

[01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:53.930]

[01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:58.830]
i did i thought it was excellent but that's old news now let's move forward

[01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:02.670]

[01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:02.930]
directions

[01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:07.530]

[01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:24.730]
i hear it's a slow day

[01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:28.890]
i wonder if it's slow enough you can answer a godfather question for me

[01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:30.170]
i am

[01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:33.370]
was watching the three movies over the past couple weeks

[01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:35.130]
in godfather three

[01:03:36.050 --> 01:03:38.950]
how did they kill don lukezi at the end

[01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:40.990]
with his glasses he took his glasses off

[01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:43.410]
and he stabbed him in the neck and opened up

[01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:44.090]
and he stabbed one of his own

[01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:48.950]
with his own glass right he grabbed the glasses off of his head and he just stabbed him in the neck

[01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:52.510]
and by not being a gushy didn't see too much of the blood but enough to make you realize

[01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:54.110]
he's uh... morto

[01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:56.590]
that's what i thought i just couldn't imagine that that's what it was

[01:03:56.590 --> 01:03:58.390]
yeah i managed to kill the man with his own glasses

[01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:59.570]
i'm pretty clever huh

[01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:01.410]
where there's a wheelers away

[01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:03.790]

[01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:06.690]

[01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:12.510]

[01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:14.290]

[01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:18.610]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eighteen t wireless line

[01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:27.790]
not only we win the election last week we got those great ratings and then the little

[01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:31.450]

we're like not just number one we're number one half

[01:04:33.850 --> 01:04:37.630]

okay we'll show you mr hot shot

[01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:43.770]
that's why anybody who develops an ego in this town has got a real problem

[01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:47.870]
because they shoot you down every god damn day

[01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:51.830]
by the way don't mention those Cuban bullets anymore okay

[01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:53.170]

[01:04:57.650 --> 01:05:03.850]
last week my days are crazy it's big i'm blue to open to learn to keep on it

[01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:07.890]
and then i hit the street to go check out my stuff

[01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:10.930]
and what happened was why i got it

[01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:17.150]

[01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:52.130]
a box box a new box a box

[01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:55.690]
thank you as a later i thought i was dying

[01:05:56.310 --> 01:06:02.010]
someone called the paramedics i presume then another dude said man you

[01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:03.690]
you

[01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:40.990]
I'm a 34-550 W. Kimmer, so continue our desperate search for a place where there's a whole

[01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:47.370]
bunch of white people. 566-505-60, pound 560 on the AT&T line. For example, they got that

[01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:52.270]
golf thing on ABC tonight. Only two golfers, this is a max tournament, okay? So only two golfers

[01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:57.870]
and one of them is Tiger Woods. What does that tell you? Got to be one white guy and one

[01:06:57.870 --> 01:07:05.710]
dark guy. Here's Coral Gables. Hello? Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I got a question for you. Have you

[01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:10.850]
seen that movie Blair Witch? No. Project? No, I read all the reviews are great. Yeah, I want

[01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:14.950]
to see it yesterday. Let me tell you something. I went home and I had to check each corner of my

[01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:19.390]
house when I got home at 12 o'clock. Oh, George said, did you see it? George, you can be thumbs-down.

[01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:24.890]
You saw that. I saw it. All the reviews are great. All the great movie if they put an ending on it.

[01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:28.910]
They're really good. Let me tell you something. Everybody says the ending sucks. I think the ending

[01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:32.770]
is the best. There was no ending. There was no ending. But how happened? They didn't end it.

[01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:36.830]
Well, they don't give you an conclusion, but it pretty much you have to think about it. If you have a

[01:07:36.830 --> 01:07:41.390]
brain, you pretty much configure it. Well, I figured it out. It sucked. George says it sucks.

[01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:47.410]
Neil, go watch it. Go watch it. I'm leaving in about 20 minutes. You're the best. Okay, thank you.

[01:07:47.850 --> 01:07:50.790]
Yeah, I'm going to leave now because obviously we got no show going on today. And of course,

[01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:53.950]
today is only August 2nd. So we got the next month to a Labor Day. It'll be a good month to

[01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:56.790]
think. In fact, that's what they do in a lot of countries in Europe. They take the home month of

[01:07:56.790 --> 01:08:00.950]
August off and they just disappear. They close up shop and they go out of town. Let's do it.

[01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:08.770]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T line. I can't believe you. I've read, in fact, even yesterday in

[01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:15.170]
one of the papers, I was reading on a plane, a glowing review about that movie, 4 out of 4 stars,

[01:08:15.330 --> 01:08:19.450]
and just went on and on about how great it was and great idea. Yeah. Great execute. And how it was

[01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:23.430]
really a horror movie that was really scary, got the tension building all the way through.

[01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:28.890]
And even credits rolls. And everybody sat in their seat until the blue rating screen came on,

[01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:33.530]
until the commercials came on and then really slowly, so as like having a wild gay sex or

[01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:39.210]
he would know, scored, scored conclusion. Exactly. Here's a mobile in the Miami. Hello.

[01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:43.130]
Hello. Yes, sir. Want to go sailing this weekend? No.

[01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:46.470]
Yes, she blows. You'll be able to say for the first time in your life.

[01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:53.470]
Uh-huh. Come on. Yeah. Come on. Yeah. Good material. Like I said, no material is crowded today. Zero.

[01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:58.830]
In short, it's in her screaming at these people on the phone just screaming in. Yeah. Oh,

[01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:06.830]
look who it is that he's screaming at. Oh, we were green. 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T line. I'm

[01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:10.430]
going home. I'll tell you that right now. I'm starting to feel really sick. I felt pretty good

[01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:12.730]
by the way. I came in this morning. I'm starting to feel a little under the weather.

[01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:20.330]
Here's a mobile in Key Largo. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, I don't know. I tuned in late.

[01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:25.690]
I don't know if I covered this or not, but the headlines in today's peril, uh, peril, a sin of

[01:09:25.690 --> 01:09:34.030]
weakness about first lady child abuse led to Clinton's infidelity. Where it was caused. Yeah, well,

[01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:37.630]
that's all they're talking about is about what she said on this interview. And I, to be honest,

[01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:41.250]
with you, I can't handle it. I can't stand it. The mother and the grandmother caused this

[01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:45.390]
infidelity. Yeah. Maybe the fact that she's the ice princess and they didn't sleep together for

[01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:48.830]
the 20 years. Maybe that had something to do with it. I think that's what it did. Okay, thank you.

[01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:53.710]
I mean, what is she going to come on here and say is that she's not into given head. So,

[01:09:53.730 --> 01:10:00.130]
naturally, she's out. Which is what we already heard was that the conversations with him in Monica

[01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:05.070]
about how Hillary couldn't satisfy him the way he wanted to be satisfied. And of course,

[01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:08.230]
it's kind of hard when you're sleeping in separate houses like Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt

[01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:16.150]
were doing talk about an arrangement. Speaking of arrangements, we're really desperate. Okay,

[01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:20.710]
let me ask you. Did you see for saving private Ryan? No. Okay, in the beginning of that, you

[01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:26.410]
remember for a while TV commercials. And I also didn't see Staling 17. Okay, thank you.

[01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:31.650]
You remember for a while shaky TV commercials were in where the camera was always shaken?

[01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:36.090]
Were you were shaking it? Yeah. You remember that? Yes, of course. That worked briefly.

[01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:41.730]
We used to call it a puke cam. Imagine an hour and a half of that.

[01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:48.130]
In what? In that movie. An hour and a half of that shaking crap.

[01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:56.110]
I was in the blur which Yamama project. Yeah, bless. I saw it. How come all the reviews are so great?

[01:10:56.550 --> 01:11:00.970]
I don't know. You know what? Because everybody's trying to be RC-Farcy. Yeah. Let me tell you what,

[01:11:00.970 --> 01:11:05.730]
it's not a movie you would go back and see a second time. It's a movie that makes you sick.

[01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:11.150]
By the time you're done, by the time it's over, you're so nauseated, anything can scare the crap out

[01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:16.830]
of you. Yeah. I had to bury my face and my wife's lap. I was so sick. It was like a bad rollercoaster.

[01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:24.210]
Are you sure that was in that order? I'm sorry. Anyway, did you find that your blood type?

[01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:29.610]
No. I thought you'd get only blood test done. When you get a blood test done, they don't tell you

[01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:34.710]
your blood type. I could call my mother and find out my blood type. Please find out your blood type.

[01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:41.670]
No. Yeah. Because you know, you need to go back and read that book again. What book? Eating for

[01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:47.230]
your blood type. Yeah, you're crazy. That was Ellie and a Bravamel. Wasn't that his name? No, no, no.

[01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:54.630]
Theodamo. Theodamo. Some day go with all the senobas. I think you'd lie.

[01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:59.750]
Vickadamo. Just get your blood type and let me know what it is on the end. No.

[01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:06.470]
Anyway, do not go see the movie. I promise you. Okay, that's our pool question. Which would be a

[01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:10.970]
better way to two hours? American pie or the Blair Witcher Frickin project? Whatever it is.

[01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:15.930]
Actually, American pie had some. Do you like that Eugene Levy? I don't know who that is.

[01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:20.110]
You know, he used to be the Schmengie brothers with John Candy. He was on Second City TV.

[01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:23.570]
By the way, Second City TV is coming back this fall, by the way. All the wider

[01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:26.730]
know if it's going to be here. It's coming back in Canada. But anyway, I would assume it

[01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:32.650]
would have it all new cast. Yeah. Anyway, John Levy was on Second City TV. He was the Jewish guy

[01:12:32.650 --> 01:12:38.390]
with the black frizzy hair, the glasses and the big shnauz. Anyway, he steals the movie.

[01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:43.750]
He's the kid's father. He's constantly catching him. Yeah, doing things. Yeah, doing things.

[01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:47.730]
But anyway, the movie was hysterical. It was known as something about Mary, but it was very good.

[01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:51.330]
Well, actually, it got pretty good reviews too from the usual suit of one electrical.

[01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:55.630]
So we gave 85 stars to the Blair Witcher Frickin project to give 81 or two to that one.

[01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:59.330]
Let me tell you what, people would jump it on that bandwagon. That movie sucked.

[01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:04.970]
Okay, have a good day. It sucked. Now we're now. Now we're what? That's a Gene

[01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:08.610]
shallot. Well, what does he know? How the hell can you see it anyway when you got all that hair in

[01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:13.010]
your way? You'd like the one kid in American pie. Yeah, I already told you that. Yeah,

[01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:17.430]
well, I'm going to go see it right now. Is he naked a lot in the movie or what? Yeah, the shirt off

[01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:20.890]
is that that's a good start. That's a good start. Always you got to get the shirt off first

[01:13:20.890 --> 01:13:26.070]
before we get everything else off, although not necessarily. 567 05 60 pound 560.

[01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:31.230]
And I noticed we got spots on the log today are recorded spots for canondigua wine.

[01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:38.470]
They're for Howard Samuel. Canondigua industry. From a great city, canondigua, New York,

[01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:43.010]
with still the same stale old 10,000 people that they had 100 years ago. And it's a great town.

[01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:48.750]
A lot of white people there too, by the way. Now that's a good question. That would be a great,

[01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:52.230]
we'll ever find out. You think there's any sports is moving in because what I live there,

[01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:57.630]
they're all in other than fact machine is beeping. Boy, this is a day from hell, you know what?

[01:13:58.130 --> 01:14:01.650]
I think the Pope's full of crap. I think there is a place such as hell, a physical place,

[01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:07.550]
and I think we're in it. That's our question. That's the searches on. We found north Lima,

[01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:12.990]
Ohio, which it turns out is nowhere near the regular ordinary Lima, just plain Lima, Ohio.

[01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:18.170]
Now we got to find out are there's sparsas in canondigua in New York. And if so, what are they doing there?

[01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:31.590]
Do you or your family suffer from things? The hunters of Zyfan wants you to know about a miracle drug

[01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:37.070]
that helps you deal with the symptoms of various things. Zyfan, one of the Department of Health's

[01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:41.730]
prestigious longest list of side effects award for two years running. Zyfan, talk to your doctor

[01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:45.530]

our lights why to get history of temptations and plagues of locusts have been associated with

[01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:53.110]
the use of Zyfan. Other possible side effects he put blinds is in his loss of weight,

[01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:56.870]

[01:14:56.870 --> 01:15:00.390]
night sweats, talking like Roger Ewer, if you are against exploding head and the gout.

[01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:03.950]
Some patients have reported blurred vision for only talking on stress and saying the phrase

[01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:08.150]
good to go. Not knees, broken bones, bumpy eyebrow makeup, high cholesterol, low esteem,

[01:15:08.150 --> 01:15:11.830]
wet packing, cause dry yeast, soft dough unit sections, cloth watching and reclamizing.

[01:15:12.090 --> 01:15:15.270]
A more significant number of Zyfan users have reported occasional thoughts of chest pain,

[01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:19.170]
random loss of knees, trouser-tinting, greasy forehead, twisting of the truth, spinal straight,

[01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:42.610]
11.45 at 5.60 WQM. So finally, after prodding and pleading and begging, here's a,

[01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:47.970]
somebody who's creative and does it by facts. It says I've been married for almost 16 years.

[01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:51.590]
The actual relationship probably lasted seven years and after our daughter was born,

[01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:54.730]
eight years ago, the marriage became nothing more than two people sharing a home,

[01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:59.250]
bills and a responsibility of raising a child. No small feet by no stretch of imagination,

[01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:03.990]
but a marriage needs a great deal more than that just to survive. During the past few years,

[01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:07.630]
I've considered divorce and I've ventured once outside the marriage, but I've remained

[01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:12.310]
married for one reason, my daughter. The marriage by definition no longer exists and you can't

[01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:16.170]
complain about my sex life because I don't have one. How I don't even recall the last time my

[01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:19.950]
wife and I did it, but the responsibility of raising my daughter outweighs the sadness of

[01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:23.530]
seeing a relationship of so many years disappearing in front of my eyes. I guess in a way this is

[01:16:23.530 --> 01:16:27.550]
an agreement of sorts in which we both know the marriage is gone, but we both stay sharing the

[01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:32.510]
responsibility of raising our daughter. How do you like that? Unsigned, of course,

[01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:38.150]
confidential, but nevertheless one of many villains of such stories in the naked city. I guarantee

[01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:43.650]
another arrangement, just like the Clinton's app, just like the Roosevelt's had, just like

[01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:47.730]
I don't know how many millions of American couples have in an arrangement,

[01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:54.790]
but nevertheless, and see in public company we're not supposed to talk about things like that.

[01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:58.470]
We're supposed to pretend that everything is beautiful and glamorous and wonderful,

[01:16:58.490 --> 01:17:01.950]
and everybody's Jewish like what's your name on a guiding light, which I can't take a

[01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:09.590]
pertain, Jesse Zepheon say. She looks about as Jewish as Earth a Kiff. Here's a mobile in Miami,

[01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:16.470]
hello? Hey Neil. Yes sir. What's up? Listen, about the Blair Witch, definitely gotta go see it.

[01:17:16.650 --> 01:17:21.710]
No. I thought this weekend I'm like one of the biggest. Everybody in this building has just

[01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:25.290]
told me since then one call. It's the worst piece of crap they ever shown her life. They said

[01:17:25.290 --> 01:17:29.830]
like having a bunch of little kids go out when making a whole movie, getting lost in the woods,

[01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:33.390]
and no conclusion. I thought I'd agree with it. It's kind of you've never seen the show cops,

[01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:36.710]
it's kind of like that where you see the camera running around chasing people. It's kind of like that.

[01:17:37.330 --> 01:17:40.710]
Okay, but it gets you into it because in the sense that it's not like every other horror movie

[01:17:40.710 --> 01:17:45.430]
that you see some stupid crappy moms that run around chasing the people. It kind of makes you feel

[01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:50.010]
like you're actually in the movie. And the ending going back to George's, there's no way

[01:17:50.010 --> 01:17:54.250]
that can end it. That's the whole basics of the movies. You know, the ending when he said,

[01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:58.290]
if you happen to see the movie, which I definitely think you should because I'm a person who hates

[01:17:58.290 --> 01:18:02.630]
the movie. I got a big 50-inch TV, I got a DVD player, so I love watching everything at all.

[01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:06.850]
I hate going to movies with a bunch of screaming kids in the background, but I want to go see this one

[01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:12.210]
and I loved it. Absolutely adored it. I thought the movie was great. I think personally you should

[01:18:12.210 --> 01:18:17.350]
go see it. I think you might like it. You know, it's a lot better than most of the other crap that

[01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:20.810]
they put in the movies. And it's definitely better than horror movies like the haunting and stuff

[01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:26.490]
like that, that every horror movie is identical to the last. Every single one is identical. This one

[01:18:26.490 --> 01:18:30.890]
at least is completely different and you really start feeling sorry for the kids because you're

[01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:35.250]
there. You're actually feeling kind of like what they're feeling. They're lost out there. They're

[01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:39.230]
going crazy. They start getting hungry and they're starting to leave and stuff. It's okay. It's a trip.

[01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:45.130]
Okay. All right, buddy. Thanks. Bye-bye. I'm on my way for the new show. 5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:50.810]
05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Am I going to go see it? No. No. Here's West Palm Beach. Hello.

[01:18:51.450 --> 01:18:55.690]
Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, we were listening to this radio show that will go around here

[01:18:55.690 --> 01:19:01.070]
and never seen the city that's portrayed in the Borough Rich Project. It is afraid to show the movie

[01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:04.250]
there because they think the people are going to go into a panic, which I think is just like

[01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:10.830]
completely stupid. And another thing, the week that it's premiered, they showed it on 26 screens.

[01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:17.470]
And it just got made more money than Star Wars did. I mean, if you want like crappy film

[01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:21.630]
quality about three-youtube kids and a forest like screening about some urban legends. Yeah.

[01:19:21.930 --> 01:19:26.330]
Just show it on TV. Save yourself a lot of money and tie more people to watch it.

[01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:30.390]
I bet you the photography on the Tom Green show is probably better than on that thing.

[01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:35.230]
Tom Green is the man. He is. I mean, he could do better than like this movie.

[01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:40.530]
Well, without even trying to just just puke him for an hour and a half and probably be more entertaining.

[01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:44.810]
Yeah, more intelligence than his mind and those three little yuppies screamers having their entire

[01:19:48.570 --> 01:19:52.810]
Yeah, okay. Thanks a lot pal. I want to stay in fact. And George Ever brings me back to the tape.

[01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:57.070]
Have you watched that yet? No. That's going to be just like me with the sopranos.

[01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:02.070]
That poker brine gave me the tape that's got all the previous episodes on it for the last 500 years.

[01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:07.010]
I don't I don't want to see the sopranos see just because I like the godfather and good mafia movies.

[01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:11.390]
And there's another one. It's got all those awards that it's nominated for and all this other book.

[01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:14.870]
That great. I'm happy for you. Okay. I don't want to see the sopranos.

[01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:19.950]
I turned on the tape. The day he gave it to me. I watched about 10 minutes of it and it went in the

[01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:24.850]
off position and it went back in the box and that's it. It just didn't do anything for me. It didn't

[01:20:24.850 --> 01:20:30.210]
capture me. You follow what I'm saying? It just didn't didn't hold my interest.

[01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:35.690]
I looked at it and I said like that and that was just like apocalypse now.

[01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:41.990]
I've tried to watch that. I bet you 10 times. I have the tape sitting right at home right now as we speak.

[01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:47.030]
About like I said 45, 50 times. I've tried to watch it. I watched the first 15, 20 minutes of it and

[01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:50.610]
I pulled it out in the stick in the box in the tape too.

[01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:55.890]
But it doesn't it's I just can't watch it. It's of no interest to me.

[01:20:56.870 --> 01:21:01.770]
See I'm not one of those people that watches a movie or a TV show because everybody else says oh

[01:21:01.770 --> 01:21:08.370]
you got to see it. Okay fine. I'll watch a few minutes. I'll try anything once almost and you know

[01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:13.450]
if it doesn't hold my interest I'll move out of something else. Something entertaining like

[01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:18.710]
which I could watch all those episodes again if you'd ever bring the damn tape back because

[01:21:18.710 --> 01:21:21.570]
you're not going to watch it. I'll trade you. I want to watch the sopranos. Huh?

[01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.630]
No, my painter is he wants to borrow that.

[01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:31.810]
What? I'm never going to get to see him. No because you're holding on to the goddamn

[01:21:31.810 --> 01:21:38.150]
eye. I can't imagine somebody like you who waste so much time doing nothing being sick all the time.

[01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:42.270]
I can't imagine something like you not watching the time green. It's got all the episodes and you'll

[01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:46.410]
see a lot of those a lot of the stuff that they're showing now like this last one. Did last

[01:21:46.410 --> 01:21:50.710]
Thursday night in MPV. I saw that. Oh yeah, but almost all those segments are from these old shows

[01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:55.450]
which maybe it's poison for you. I even though they're still funny the second time. Although I

[01:21:55.450 --> 01:22:01.230]
really could have lived without the worm that thing. No, I just just I mean I watched it and

[01:22:01.230 --> 01:22:05.030]
yeah it's very funny but it's just a little bit too gross. You know what I'm saying? The meal worms

[01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:13.270]
were like almost semi-racing to the bowl but not quite. Here's Carl Springs. Hello.

[01:22:13.730 --> 01:22:17.270]
Okay, how you doing? Okay sir. Hey, get the movies today. Go buy

[01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:24.290]
videos to or get analyzed. Have you seen it yet? No. You haven't seen the analyzed? Isn't

[01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:29.970]
it John V. Volta in that? No, it's really crystal in Robert De Niro. Oh yeah, yeah, no, there's no

[01:22:29.970 --> 01:22:35.290]
way I would watch that. That's forced another role that they invented for Robert De Niro to play another

[01:22:35.290 --> 01:22:40.290]
Guitau. Oh man, that was a great movie I've ever seen. Funnier than crap. The greatest movie you

[01:22:40.290 --> 01:22:48.730]
ever saw. It's a far funny ghost. I'm off of you comedy. Okay, thanks. Now there's one. You can

[01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:52.270]
mark it down right now and you'll never go see that. No. I saw the clips from that.

[01:22:53.170 --> 01:22:59.190]
First of all, Robert De Niro, he talked about leaving you cold. He is so overrated. It's a joke.

[01:23:00.490 --> 01:23:04.370]
Robert De Niro, what he contributed to the godfather trilogy, you could stick in a

[01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:09.570]
symbol and have room for the old Soviet army in there. He contributed nothing to it.

[01:23:11.190 --> 01:23:15.550]
If it could have been anybody that played the young Vito Corleone, it could have been anybody else.

[01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:19.530]
The only movie I ever saw him in that way he was good and was a once upon a time in America.

[01:23:19.530 --> 01:23:23.490]
That was pretty good in that. If you had like four or five extra hours to kill.

[01:23:24.370 --> 01:23:28.610]
And there's another movie by the way. Exactly. I'm seeing. Notice how that popped into my mind.

[01:23:28.890 --> 01:23:32.310]
Exactly what you're saying with this Blair Witch one was a project.

[01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:38.350]
You watch the movie for like 17 hours once upon a time in America, the uncut version.

[01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:41.950]
Oh, that's because they were tied in from the old country. That's why they were uncut.

[01:23:42.130 --> 01:23:45.010]
But nevertheless, you watch the whole thing and it gets to the end and is there an ending?

[01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:47.250]
No. No. It just ends.

[01:23:48.650 --> 01:23:54.250]
And you're assuming that James Woods got cobbled up in the garbage truck there at the end.

[01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:56.950]
Although you don't see those vids popping out, which really makes you wonder.

[01:23:58.330 --> 01:24:02.170]
You ever notice Wayne High Pinga where do you make all this money in the garbage business?

[01:24:02.630 --> 01:24:06.150]
James Woods was in that role where he allegedly got chewed up in the garbage store and both

[01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:10.290]
had the same complexion. You ever notice that? Same vids. Maybe they rubbed it together.

[01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:13.230]
Here's a mobile in Halendale. Hello.

[01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:17.430]
Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, did you see that fraternity bid on that 2020 last night?

[01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:20.330]
Yeah, I talked about it. I said all fraternity should be banned starting right now.

[01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:22.490]
You think they shall be banned? Yes.

[01:24:23.490 --> 01:24:24.750]
What about the academic ones?

[01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:29.590]
All right, let me say it again. All fraternities should be banned. What purpose do they serve?

[01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:30.350]
What's the point?

[01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:32.830]
You drink a lot of beer and bang a lot of water.

[01:24:32.970 --> 01:24:34.750]
Why do you have to be in a fraternity and do that?

[01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:36.810]
It's just a lot easier to meet chicks that way.

[01:24:36.970 --> 01:24:37.690]
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

[01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:40.390]
Uh-huh. There's a real genius for you.

[01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:41.890]
Real easy to meet chicks that way.

[01:24:42.090 --> 01:24:45.230]
Of course, I guess that can't be meeting any more chicks as he can tell that he's dead.

[01:24:46.710 --> 01:24:48.430]
Unless it's chicks or like a guy in a box.

[01:24:50.410 --> 01:24:54.550]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0.5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:58.170]
See, I say these things which are on, you know, just on the face of them,

[01:24:58.190 --> 01:25:01.170]
obviously anybody with a brain who's on it would say, yeah, right on, baby.

[01:25:01.410 --> 01:25:03.370]
But you know something, they're not the American F and way.

[01:25:04.090 --> 01:25:06.010]
So some punk like this last color there.

[01:25:06.010 --> 01:25:08.630]
Oh gee, well, you know, fraternity and he's probably an

[01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:11.590]
fraternity or was in one like a lot of you college punks out there.

[01:25:13.570 --> 01:25:14.690]
There's no need for it.

[01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:16.190]
Absolutely none.

[01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:22.010]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0.5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:25.030]
Here's a mobile, in-fort, lottery, all hello.

[01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:26.250]
Hey, how are you doing, Neil?

[01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.810]
Okay, sir.

[01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:28.510]
I'm sorry to follow that brain surgeon like that.

[01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:31.950]
Anyway, listen, I wanted to defend this upon a little bit.

[01:25:32.730 --> 01:25:34.430]
I'm not a big, you know, it was a pretty good thing.

[01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:37.290]
The whole thing about the show was, it was never really meant,

[01:25:37.530 --> 01:25:40.970]
it wasn't really promoted at big by HBO, like it was going to be a big, big deal.

[01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:42.990]
And it just kind of grew by word of mouth.

[01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:43.530]
Yeah.

[01:25:43.670 --> 01:25:44.990]
People kind of liked it.

[01:25:45.210 --> 01:25:45.870]
I really enjoyed it.

[01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:48.690]
The first couple of shows I said, oh, this is nothing.

[01:25:49.170 --> 01:25:51.870]
And then it was on like every Sunday night and then I started watching it.

[01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:56.290]
And once you get into the characters and you know, you like kind of like a soap opera kind of deal.

[01:25:56.410 --> 01:25:56.570]
Yeah.

[01:25:56.690 --> 01:25:59.150]
Once you identify with the characters, it really becomes realistic.

[01:25:59.510 --> 01:26:00.370]
You know, the interview's some-

[01:26:00.370 --> 01:26:01.970]
I already got a Puerto Rican Mafia family.

[01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:03.170]
I'm guiding life doesn't have to.

[01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:04.270]
That's what I heard about that one.

[01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:06.710]
I, I haven't seen a lot of work in it.

[01:26:06.710 --> 01:26:09.530]
I work in a night time so I'm available to watch those but I haven't really got into those.

[01:26:10.490 --> 01:26:11.870]
Listen, I do a lot of chip stage.

[01:26:12.150 --> 01:26:15.190]
I know you're planning on moving to Europe one these days when your contract runs out.

[01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:16.850]
If you ever make enough dough.

[01:26:17.530 --> 01:26:18.390]
But I'm on the opposite.

[01:26:18.530 --> 01:26:19.490]
Listen, you've got to go get Thailand.

[01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:21.250]
Everybody does-

[01:26:21.250 --> 01:26:22.330]
No, I'm telling you they're not-

[01:26:22.330 --> 01:26:23.630]
I'm not a child monster.

[01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:26.370]
No, no, not like enough of the sex towards anybody like that.

[01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:27.490]
But the country's pretty good.

[01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:28.190]
The food is great.

[01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:29.250]
Yeah, but you look how far it is.

[01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:30.490]
How long did it take to get there?

[01:26:30.890 --> 01:26:32.390]
From here, good 18 hours.

[01:26:33.370 --> 01:26:34.090]
El Paso.

[01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:34.330]
No.

[01:26:34.330 --> 01:26:39.590]
It's a long deal but listen, I've been bringing back some stuff from there as far as

[01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:40.850]
porn goes.

[01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:42.530]
Anywhere I can get in touch with that alcohol fee?

[01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.910]
For what?

[01:26:45.010 --> 01:26:48.310]
I got the raw footage that I might get promoted generally.

[01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:49.250]
Yeah, okay.

[01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:49.790]
Whatever you say.

[01:26:49.870 --> 01:26:50.490]
Have a great day pal.

[01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:53.390]
El's got the raw stuff he needs.

[01:26:53.550 --> 01:26:54.770]
Okay, he's about as raw as it gets.

[01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:59.470]
See, oh no, it's not for the sex thing and then he starts talking about how beautiful it is.

[01:26:59.470 --> 01:27:00.970]
And oh, by the way, he's got a bunch of porn, oh,

[01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:02.370]
that he brought back from there and some raw stuff.

[01:27:02.610 --> 01:27:04.170]
Yeah, probably 10-year-old kids, okay?

[01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:06.150]
Trace the call to pedophile.

[01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:10.170]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:12.510]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:14.690]
And I just want to say this in passing, okay,

[01:27:14.710 --> 01:27:15.970]
because I don't want to get sidetracked on it.

[01:27:16.170 --> 01:27:18.490]
I hate to break the news to you, but last time I checked,

[01:27:18.690 --> 01:27:20.350]
they don't cure pedophiles, okay?

[01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:22.830]
So they need to put them away and keep them away,

[01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:24.510]
and that would solve that problem.

[01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:28.230]
And some kind of an institution, if they would deal with it like an illness, okay?

[01:27:28.230 --> 01:27:30.710]
Put them away, lock them away somewhere, and that's it.

[01:27:36.490 --> 01:27:38.510]
You know, today, even though I shouldn't do it,

[01:27:38.530 --> 01:27:40.230]
because I'm in a really good mood and I feel fine,

[01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:41.970]
and the sun is shining somewhere.

[01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:46.410]
But today would be a real appropriate day for me to just go nuts and go off on the sales department

[01:27:46.410 --> 01:27:47.990]
here again, and on this whole operation.

[01:27:48.210 --> 01:27:51.310]
Here we just had Scrooan Winnick, our esteemed sales manager.

[01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:54.450]
She gets the employee of the suck-up of the month thing from Greg Reed,

[01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:57.250]
which is okay because that thing's a joke anyway, and we all laugh at it.

[01:27:58.230 --> 01:28:03.650]
But isn't it amazing that we work in a place where there is no such thing as servicing an account.

[01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:07.670]
I have no idea why any advertisers advertise on this radio station.

[01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:14.170]
Because the management here really and truly honestly doesn't care about doing a job for these people.

[01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:18.110]
I mean, I've worked in stations before.

[01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:20.710]
It always has been a problem getting copied that makes them sense.

[01:28:20.770 --> 01:28:23.270]
Give us something to work with, something with some teeth in it.

[01:28:23.410 --> 01:28:25.770]
I heard Hank screaming about this the other day and rightfully so.

[01:28:26.850 --> 01:28:28.690]
But it's gotten so bad now.

[01:28:28.690 --> 01:28:31.110]
And is there anybody in this building doing anything about it?

[01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:33.710]
Oh, you know, Ray Perry, they'll drag him up here about once every six months,

[01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:36.470]
and he'll talk a good game, and he'll go and tap somebody on a shoulder,

[01:28:36.610 --> 01:28:37.710]
and maybe something will happen.

[01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:42.310]
But these people manage it's unbelievable to stuff that I was just telling George,

[01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:47.930]
I have never ever in my life been handed the swill, the craft that I get handed here,

[01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:50.430]
and then people say, okay, make magic for the sponsor.

[01:28:50.710 --> 01:28:51.470]
Do a wonderful job.

[01:28:52.150 --> 01:28:53.710]
And I'm sitting here going, yeah.

[01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:55.490]
What are you talking about?

[01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:56.270]
What does this mean?

[01:28:56.570 --> 01:28:57.750]
It's in hieroglyphics.

[01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:58.970]
It makes no sense to me.

[01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:03.750]
And they just don't care.

[01:29:04.090 --> 01:29:04.990]
I'm not making that up.

[01:29:05.050 --> 01:29:05.850]
I'm not exaggerating.

[01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:06.770]
I'm not trying to be dramatic.

[01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:08.710]
I'm just telling you the way it is.

[01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:12.010]
They just don't give a flying crap in this place.

[01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:16.150]
And I have nothing but the greatest disrespect for people who have no,

[01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:17.330]
who just don't care.

[01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:20.290]
I can come on here and say, okay, I don't care either.

[01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:22.130]
Like I did three, four months ago and do that,

[01:29:22.130 --> 01:29:22.730]
and I'm going to say, I'm going to go to the gildy routine,

[01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:24.110]
just take the money, thank you.

[01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:26.190]
And you can go on that for a little while,

[01:29:26.190 --> 01:29:29.490]
but after a while you start saying, what kind of swill is this?

[01:29:29.770 --> 01:29:31.630]
How can you people be so uninvolved?

[01:29:31.770 --> 01:29:33.070]
How can you take the money?

[01:29:33.490 --> 01:29:36.410]
How can you take the commission when you're not servicing your accounts?

[01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:40.850]
And he puts a memo out about the screw and winnick

[01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:43.290]
and what a wonderful sales department you put together

[01:29:43.290 --> 01:29:45.430]
of misfits, of mental midgets,

[01:29:45.690 --> 01:29:48.590]
who are busy having best fights downstairs on the second floor,

[01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:51.370]
because they're trying to prove which one's the biggest moron.

[01:29:54.710 --> 01:29:57.930]
God, it's just shocking to me, do these people read this stuff?

[01:29:58.010 --> 01:29:58.070]
No.

[01:29:58.210 --> 01:29:59.050]
Do they look at it?

[01:29:59.050 --> 01:30:00.210]
Do they think about it?

[01:30:00.210 --> 01:30:03.510]
Do they have any concept of what it is that they're handing to us?

[01:30:06.810 --> 01:30:07.530]
Embarrassing, embarrassing.

[01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:11.790]
Here's a mobile in Boynton V, cello.

[01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.650]
Hello, Neil.

[01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:16.170]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:16.810 --> 01:30:17.250]
How are you, Dave?

[01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.730]
Okay.

[01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:21.670]
Just came out of a steak and shake drive through in Boynton.

[01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:22.810]
Brand new.

[01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:24.810]
A steak and shake is open in Boynton V?

[01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:25.390]
Yes, it is.

[01:30:25.770 --> 01:30:25.770]

[01:30:26.090 --> 01:30:26.890]
I feel better.

[01:30:27.630 --> 01:30:28.410]
I couldn't get in.

[01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:29.650]
I had to go through the drive through.

[01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:30.130]
Yeah.

[01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:33.470]
I had myself a double third-learned book burger, very lean,

[01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:36.890]
very excellent, and a French fries.

[01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:37.670]
Oh, the best.

[01:30:38.290 --> 01:30:40.750]
Guinea-Fried, very grease-free.

[01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:42.350]
I give it a nine.

[01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:43.130]
Okay.

[01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:44.130]
I give it a nine.

[01:30:44.210 --> 01:30:44.710]
Now where is it?

[01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:47.890]
A whole Boynton Road just west of Congress.

[01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.810]
Near the borders.

[01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:51.130]
Starting near the border.

[01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:51.990]
How long has it been open?

[01:30:52.850 --> 01:30:53.430]
Probably a week.

[01:30:53.890 --> 01:30:54.130]
A week.

[01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.790]
Yeah.

[01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:57.270]
Which means the one in plantation acres can't be far behind.

[01:30:57.630 --> 01:30:57.830]
No.

[01:30:58.250 --> 01:30:58.650]
Or it's far.

[01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:59.250]
I swear to that.

[01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.450]
Great.

[01:30:59.890 --> 01:31:01.210]
Okay, thanks for the good news, pal.

[01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:02.030]
Take care now.

[01:31:02.170 --> 01:31:03.070]
And don't shake it too hard.

[01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:04.970]
Steak and shake is open in Boynton V.

[01:31:05.490 --> 01:31:06.910]
Just in time for our lunch,

[01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:09.050]
showing up from our good friend, Debrado Bertone's,

[01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.510]
at a hundred ninety-third North-Western Avenue,

[01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:13.810]
where their stuff just keeps getting better and better and better.

[01:31:14.710 --> 01:31:15.210]
Yeah, sure.

[01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:15.910]
I'll take one, Joe.

[01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:16.170]
Why not?

[01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:17.850]
I'll not stick this back in there if you would.

[01:31:18.610 --> 01:31:19.730]
Or just plain stick it.

[01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:22.150]
Yeah, in fact, we were all commenting here on Friday

[01:31:22.150 --> 01:31:23.590]
that their pizza is getting so good

[01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:25.290]
that they're starting to make some other people real nervous.

[01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:26.470]
I don't want to mention any names.

[01:31:26.710 --> 01:31:27.150]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:31:27.670 --> 01:31:29.210]
Other places where their stuff is real good,

[01:31:29.210 --> 01:31:31.670]
but they're climbing right up to the top of the ladder.

[01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:32.970]
Our buddy, Brett, over at Tonys.

[01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:37.310]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[01:31:37.730 --> 01:31:40.110]
pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:42.670]
Here's a mobile in South Miami.

[01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:43.010]
Hello.

[01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.910]
Daniel.

[01:31:45.130 --> 01:31:45.570]
Yes, sir.

[01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:46.670]
Hi, how are you, sir?

[01:31:46.710 --> 01:31:46.890]
Great.

[01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:48.570]
Pleasure to talk to you.

[01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:52.710]
I know how adamantly you feel towards the news stations,

[01:31:52.710 --> 01:31:54.570]
and I just want to interject something here.

[01:31:54.630 --> 01:31:55.770]
How adamantly I feel toward what?

[01:31:56.190 --> 01:31:57.510]
Towards the news stations,

[01:31:57.730 --> 01:31:58.450]
these news people,

[01:31:58.610 --> 01:32:01.090]
how they project something, you know,

[01:32:01.230 --> 01:32:03.670]
a story and they take it completely out of context.

[01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:07.130]
Like Channel 710, you know what I mean?

[01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:08.350]
Yeah, four takes.

[01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:10.310]
Okay, the shooting is in Atlanta.

[01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:12.630]
Yeah, the shooting in Atlanta.

[01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:15.850]
The guy, the guy, the shooting, they say,

[01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:18.730]
oh, you know, he had a took us fall at the stock market

[01:32:18.730 --> 01:32:20.090]
and he went crazy from it.

[01:32:20.570 --> 01:32:22.830]
The guy, the guy was already crazy, you know,

[01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:24.570]
and this is what gets me so mad.

[01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:27.350]
Well, you see, they're very upset because he's dead.

[01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:30.150]
So they can't analyze, they can't interview him,

[01:32:30.510 --> 01:32:31.730]
they can't have an ongoing thing.

[01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:33.790]
And the thing with the trick is in Auckland, Colorado.

[01:32:34.290 --> 01:32:36.790]
The media get very frustrated when the perpetrator is dead.

[01:32:37.210 --> 01:32:39.510]
Right, and then it's just, that's what they do with everybody.

[01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:42.510]
Somebody does something crazy and they blame it on,

[01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:45.190]
you know, stocks or white.

[01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:45.790]
Everyone has a problem.

[01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:48.870]
Yeah, the fact that he bludgeoned his ex-wife and,

[01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:50.390]
and four he did it.

[01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.750]
Right.

[01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:52.210]
A lot of them, six years ago.

[01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:54.630]
Maybe he just had a bad day at the track that day.

[01:32:54.810 --> 01:32:55.310]
There you go.

[01:32:55.530 --> 01:32:57.250]
And I just want to say they're all a bunch of idiots

[01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:59.310]
and also the,

[01:32:59.870 --> 01:33:01.710]
do you see, got me, took my material.

[01:33:02.230 --> 01:33:03.090]
Okay, and have a great day.

[01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.350]

[01:33:04.190 --> 01:33:06.070]
Hey, listen, they don't have a lot of material today,

[01:33:06.170 --> 01:33:07.370]
but at least they make the effort to call,

[01:33:07.450 --> 01:33:08.250]
which is more than I can say,

[01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:09.230]
for most of this crowd today.

[01:33:09.230 --> 01:33:10.610]
And every Monday of my life,

[01:33:11.150 --> 01:33:12.670]
just tears your kishki's out.

[01:33:12.930 --> 01:33:14.390]
Just like reaching into your intestines

[01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:16.130]
and pulling your kishki's out.

[01:33:16.230 --> 01:33:18.010]
Oh, I do like something that's good stuff, Dermot.

[01:33:18.490 --> 01:33:19.350]
That's a pickle, Burl.

[01:33:20.210 --> 01:33:21.470]
I love my stuff, kishki.

[01:33:21.610 --> 01:33:23.110]
But I never got there this weekend because,

[01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:23.550]
well,

[01:33:25.290 --> 01:33:26.290]
5, 6, 7, 0,

[01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:27.370]
0, 5, 60,

[01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:29.830]
pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:31.210]
Here's Key Largo.

[01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:31.470]
Hello.

[01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:32.370]
Hey, Neil.

[01:33:32.650 --> 01:33:32.970]
Yes, sir.

[01:33:33.230 --> 01:33:34.270]
Yeah, I'm, I'll tell you,

[01:33:35.010 --> 01:33:37.250]
every Sunday of my day, I'd like to go get my email.

[01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:38.070]
Uh-huh.

[01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:40.210]
And, uh, he went across the street the other day and, uh,

[01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:42.690]
he put his money in and he'd give the paper out and he'd

[01:33:42.690 --> 01:33:43.330]
read, he looked at it,

[01:33:43.450 --> 01:33:43.990]
it's all in Spanish.

[01:33:45.710 --> 01:33:46.030]
Yeah.

[01:33:46.290 --> 01:33:48.150]
There's, uh, they, they didn't, they switched them.

[01:33:48.610 --> 01:33:49.690]
The English ones are Spanish.

[01:33:50.090 --> 01:33:50.430]
They what?

[01:33:50.730 --> 01:33:51.930]
They switched like the English hero.

[01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:52.470]
Yeah.

[01:33:52.730 --> 01:33:53.710]
And put a Spanish one in there.

[01:33:53.890 --> 01:33:54.090]
Yeah.

[01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:55.530]
And they didn't plan English one around,

[01:33:55.650 --> 01:33:56.330]
anywhere in the area.

[01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:58.470]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

[01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:59.210]
Okay.

[01:33:59.590 --> 01:34:00.190]
And another thing,

[01:34:00.330 --> 01:34:01.450]
Key at the passport office, yes?

[01:34:01.670 --> 01:34:03.650]
It is, uh, I think you should go get

[01:34:03.650 --> 01:34:04.330]
to the Blair Witch,

[01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:05.070]
but if you do,

[01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:08.150]
to Mayhun's sci-fi, they have a special about it.

[01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:10.390]
Wish my girlfriend, she said that you should watch it

[01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:11.190]
before you see the movie.

[01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:11.630]
Okay.

[01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:12.810]
Cause I give you all this, uh,

[01:34:13.050 --> 01:34:13.830]
other info on it.

[01:34:14.530 --> 01:34:15.430]
And it is a good movie.

[01:34:15.630 --> 01:34:16.170]
Okay, I'll do it.

[01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:16.470]
See him.

[01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:18.090]
He says it's a good movie, by the way,

[01:34:18.130 --> 01:34:19.690]
George, you said you're full of crap and so is Tommy.

[01:34:20.090 --> 01:34:20.870]
Tommy said it sucked.

[01:34:22.570 --> 01:34:23.370]
Now, Paul Harvey Jr.

[01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:24.030]
What did he say?

[01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:25.630]
I'm, I don't even remember what he said.

[01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:26.390]
He said it sucked.

[01:34:26.690 --> 01:34:28.790]
Oh, well, one of the last time you agreed with him.

[01:34:29.290 --> 01:34:29.610]
Never.

[01:34:30.010 --> 01:34:31.010]
That was the first time.

[01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:31.470]
Yeah.

[01:34:33.630 --> 01:34:33.950]
Yeah.

[01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:35.250]
So aren't you beginning to wonder about it

[01:34:35.250 --> 01:34:36.190]
when you start agreeing with him

[01:34:36.190 --> 01:34:37.750]
that maybe you remember this cut movie before?

[01:34:38.570 --> 01:34:40.130]
Five, well, maybe how about Lijay Cobb?

[01:34:40.170 --> 01:34:40.990]
He likes to talk film.

[01:34:41.410 --> 01:34:42.290]
Right, Father Perinoia?

[01:34:43.050 --> 01:34:43.310]
Uh-huh.

[01:34:43.890 --> 01:34:44.910]
Five, six, seven, oh five,

[01:34:45.010 --> 01:34:45.810]
six, the pound five,

[01:34:45.810 --> 01:34:46.990]
six, the Honorable One Line,

[01:34:47.050 --> 01:34:47.910]
and a very weak one.

[01:34:48.010 --> 01:34:48.830]
They were one of the weakest days

[01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:49.670]
in the history of my life.

[01:34:49.670 --> 01:34:50.190]
I'm pretty bad.

[01:34:50.930 --> 01:34:51.890]
How come I'm so strong

[01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:53.190]
and the audience is so weak?

[01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:53.770]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:55.850]
How come I'm so God damn strong

[01:34:55.850 --> 01:34:58.110]
as they would say on a boring morning show of ours?

[01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:59.690]
Boy, you're really strong today.

[01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:02.690]
Much I love the way that they use that word like, uh,

[01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:03.410]
silly.

[01:35:03.630 --> 01:35:05.110]
It's a silly show for silly people.

[01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:08.350]
It's the biggest pile of force crap

[01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:09.650]
I have ever seen

[01:35:09.650 --> 01:35:11.490]
in my freaking fracking life.

[01:35:11.770 --> 01:35:13.650]
He was America's golden boy.

[01:35:14.350 --> 01:35:15.550]
The one who couldn't be,

[01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.990]
but never was,

[01:35:17.490 --> 01:35:19.270]
and really didn't want to.

[01:35:20.090 --> 01:35:22.010]
Oliver's soul brings to the screen

[01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:24.330]
the tragedy that chopped the nation.

[01:35:24.850 --> 01:35:25.570]
JFK Jr.

[01:35:26.130 --> 01:35:27.570]
starring Will Smith.

[01:35:27.570 --> 01:35:27.950]
Yeah.

[01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:29.050]
JFK Jr.

[01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:30.070]
JFK Jr.

[01:35:30.490 --> 01:35:31.270]
JFK Jr.

[01:35:32.650 --> 01:35:32.650]

[01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:33.370]
JFK Jr.

[01:35:33.630 --> 01:35:33.630]

[01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:34.450]
JFK Jr.

[01:35:34.890 --> 01:35:35.570]
JFK Jr.

[01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.690]
JFK Jr.

[01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.930]
JFK Jr.

[01:35:41.130 --> 01:35:42.290]
JFK Jr.

[01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:44.450]
JFK Jr.

[01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.930]

[01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:45.630]
JFK Jr.

[01:35:45.630 --> 01:35:45.750]
J.

[01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:47.130]
JFK Jr.

[01:35:47.650 --> 01:35:49.470]
Also starring Joe Pesci.

[01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:50.870]
He was a remitter.

[01:35:51.410 --> 01:35:52.970]
He was like a...

[01:35:52.970 --> 01:35:53.670]
a sausage,

[01:35:54.150 --> 01:35:54.890]
wrapped in a...

[01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:55.870]
in a cotton net.

[01:35:56.630 --> 01:35:57.310]
All right.

[01:35:57.930 --> 01:35:59.150]
What up, get a f***ing run.

[01:35:59.950 --> 01:36:01.530]
Hey, we're all safe and clear.

[01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:03.130]
We knew what f***ing B.

[01:36:03.530 --> 01:36:04.710]
Will Smith does.

[01:36:05.130 --> 01:36:06.430]
As JFK Jr.

[01:36:06.970 --> 01:36:07.830]
you will watch it,

[01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:10.070]
starring into a theater near you.

[01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:12.450]
This is the one with the lights on.

[01:36:13.110 --> 01:36:13.470]
You know,

[01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:14.910]
say you can see this.

[01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:21.630]
Something for everybody in this video, I'll tell you.

[01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:23.170]
I do enjoy watching this.

[01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:24.010]
I do, I do.

[01:36:24.330 --> 01:36:25.470]
This is the best video.

[01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:26.030]
There you go.

[01:36:26.210 --> 01:36:27.310]
We can agree on that.

[01:36:27.970 --> 01:36:29.510]
I be eighth degrees, Billy.

[01:36:29.630 --> 01:36:30.830]
I'm your open man.

[01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:34.070]
You're a new paradise.

[01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:38.690]
In the world, I'm not safe.

[01:36:39.650 --> 01:36:40.750]
Ha ha ha ha ha.

[01:36:41.190 --> 01:36:43.390]
Do it all by heart.

[01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:46.270]
Do my tongue in thee.

[01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:47.530]
I do.

[01:36:48.570 --> 01:36:49.550]
There you go.

[01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:51.690]
Do it all by heart.

[01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:54.850]
Do it all by heart.

[01:36:54.850 --> 01:36:54.870]
Do it all by heart.

[01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.890]
Do it all by heart.

[01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.930]
Do it all by heart.

[01:36:54.930 --> 01:36:54.930]

[01:36:54.930 --> 01:36:54.930]

[01:36:54.930 --> 01:36:55.610]
I wanted it.

[01:36:55.810 --> 01:36:57.890]
You don't have to think by.

[01:36:59.190 --> 01:37:01.090]
Just that I'll find a lot of them already.

[01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:04.150]
Well, yeah, what are he doing in this group, that I'll find them?

[01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:06.970]
I always got to be some minority kind of guy.

[01:37:07.090 --> 01:37:09.490]
Every group, every come or so, every TV show,

[01:37:09.630 --> 01:37:11.330]
you get to be I'll find a lot of that group.

[01:37:11.710 --> 01:37:12.690]
I thought you liked what guy.

[01:37:12.690 --> 01:37:14.950]
And it's a little funny guy too, getting him out of there.

[01:37:15.010 --> 01:37:16.470]
There's a group of other Jeff and Nick Zelda.

[01:37:16.770 --> 01:37:17.330]
Get these other guys.

[01:37:17.410 --> 01:37:18.110]
They can't even sing.

[01:37:20.370 --> 01:37:21.830]
And he noticed at the end, he says,

[01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:22.770]
Beth's up.

[01:37:23.210 --> 01:37:23.610]
Beth's up.

[01:37:23.850 --> 01:37:25.130]
Everybody else has got, you know,

[01:37:25.210 --> 01:37:26.750]
they're all supposedly dating the same trick,

[01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:28.010]
but he used your hooters.

[01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:29.170]
He's Beth's up.

[01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:29.610]
What?

[01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.290]
Yeah.

[01:37:30.750 --> 01:37:32.270]
What do you expect from an albino anyway?

[01:37:36.130 --> 01:37:37.350]
I got to say that there's Nick.

[01:37:37.570 --> 01:37:38.710]
And then this Nick, nothing Nick does.

[01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:40.830]
From the, this Nick is the first ugly guy.

[01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:42.510]
I've ever been like all excited about my life.

[01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:43.290]
And he is ugly.

[01:37:44.770 --> 01:37:45.950]
But from the chin down,

[01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:48.730]
future plays a mean chin ball.

[01:37:52.230 --> 01:37:52.630]
What about you?

[01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:57.030]
What did I say about 98 to 3?

[01:37:57.190 --> 01:37:58.110]
Did you recall the night time?

[01:37:58.770 --> 01:37:59.550]
Actually, it's done.

[01:38:00.230 --> 01:38:00.990]
Baby, baby.

[01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:03.610]
Baby.

[01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:10.030]
Man, I was just put that girl in my living room, bro.

[01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:11.170]
That's my girlfriend.

[01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:12.330]
I just proposed her.

[01:38:13.710 --> 01:38:14.370]
Beth's up.

[01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:15.150]
Beth's up.

[01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:16.430]
He can't even just sit there.

[01:38:17.050 --> 01:38:18.330]
Yeah, get him out of there.

[01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.830]
Get them out of there.

[01:38:18.830 --> 01:38:20.050]
I'll find about 98 degrees.

[01:38:20.170 --> 01:38:20.690]
We'll have a hit.

[01:38:20.970 --> 01:38:21.210]
Oh!

[01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:23.530]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:25.430]
pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:26.870]
You go watch the,

[01:38:27.090 --> 01:38:27.890]
whatever that,

[01:38:28.450 --> 01:38:30.390]
you will know the which your movie is,

[01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:31.270]
whatever that thing is.

[01:38:31.630 --> 01:38:32.970]
And I'll watch your 98 degrees.

[01:38:33.370 --> 01:38:33.710]
Thank you.

[01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:38.490]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, and pound 5, 60.

[01:38:38.490 --> 01:38:40.330]
In fact, that's our question.

[01:38:40.510 --> 01:38:41.470]
The Blair Witch Project,

[01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:44.310]
or the 98 degrees video we just saw,

[01:38:44.490 --> 01:38:46.050]
I do want to stick it somewhere.

[01:38:46.450 --> 01:38:46.950]
Under the flute.

[01:38:47.290 --> 01:38:47.750]
There you go.

[01:38:48.690 --> 01:38:49.810]
Here's a mobile and deer field.

[01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.090]
Hello.

[01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:52.090]
I'm all the brother, Mike.

[01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:52.870]
I want respect.

[01:38:54.230 --> 01:38:54.730]
I want me.

[01:38:54.810 --> 01:38:55.450]
I'm smart.

[01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.790]
I'm smart.

[01:38:57.050 --> 01:38:57.290]
I want me back.

[01:38:57.290 --> 01:38:58.710]
I found like everybody says.

[01:38:58.930 --> 01:38:59.410]
I'm smart.

[01:38:59.730 --> 01:39:00.810]
I'm smart, Michael.

[01:39:01.630 --> 01:39:02.470]
I gotta go.

[01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:03.090]
Okay.

[01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:06.610]
I did see Godfather too, by the way,

[01:39:06.610 --> 01:39:08.450]
in my hotel room to Saturday night.

[01:39:09.690 --> 01:39:10.390]
Or was it Friday night?

[01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:11.370]
I know it's Friday night.

[01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:13.810]
Did see that again?

[01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:15.450]
Godfather too, you know,

[01:39:15.530 --> 01:39:16.770]
and no matter any of the three,

[01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:17.790]
they come on television and I,

[01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:19.170]
as soon as I see it, I'm stuck.

[01:39:19.330 --> 01:39:20.030]
I can't turn it off.

[01:39:20.090 --> 01:39:21.530]
I just watched it to its conclusion.

[01:39:21.530 --> 01:39:22.710]
If it was on before in the morning,

[01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:24.170]
I would sit there still glued with it.

[01:39:24.190 --> 01:39:25.810]
That's how great the Godfather 12 G is.

[01:39:26.050 --> 01:39:28.530]
Even including Godfather 3 with the big nose and a bad acting,

[01:39:28.770 --> 01:39:29.810]
I don't care what anybody says.

[01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:30.850]
It's still got its moments.

[01:39:32.230 --> 01:39:33.010]
And these people would,

[01:39:33.010 --> 01:39:34.670]
oh, you gotta watch the sopranos.

[01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.370]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:39:35.370 --> 01:39:37.010]
I forgot the sopranos, okay?

[01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:38.690]
Not interested.

[01:39:39.970 --> 01:39:41.470]
Here's a mobile and West Palm Beach.

[01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.690]
Hello.

[01:39:42.690 --> 01:39:42.930]
Hello.

[01:39:43.210 --> 01:39:43.510]
Yes, sir.

[01:39:43.930 --> 01:39:44.130]
Meal.

[01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:44.550]
Yes.

[01:39:44.690 --> 01:39:45.030]
First time.

[01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:46.270]
Long time.

[01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:46.730]
All right.

[01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:48.030]
Hey, yeah.

[01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:49.530]
I'll probably go and call you.

[01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:50.670]
You've got to, it was actually

[01:39:50.670 --> 01:39:51.650]
Scheme 98 degrees.

[01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:53.650]
I had to take my kid to the Nickelodeon

[01:39:53.650 --> 01:39:54.670]
get assessed where they were.

[01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:55.810]
And there were about 20

[01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:57.950]
inks, back street, 40.

[01:39:58.830 --> 01:39:59.690]
98 degrees.

[01:40:00.850 --> 01:40:02.170]
Fake fans going on.

[01:40:02.250 --> 01:40:02.390]
Right.

[01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:04.830]
I think they're multiplying in Orlando there

[01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:06.330]
and just kind of cranking it up.

[01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:10.790]
Yeah, but three hits each one.

[01:40:11.190 --> 01:40:11.570]
Yeah, okay.

[01:40:11.710 --> 01:40:12.430]
Your phone's crappy now.

[01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:13.990]
Whatever you, what do you say they say they could sing?

[01:40:14.170 --> 01:40:14.690]
No, they can.

[01:40:14.770 --> 01:40:14.990]
They're good.

[01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:16.730]
Actually Nick is the only one of the groups

[01:40:16.730 --> 01:40:17.350]
they really can sing.

[01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:18.450]
And once in a while the brother Jeff

[01:40:19.110 --> 01:40:19.990]
who's got a great body.

[01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:20.790]
By the way, but nevertheless,

[01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.910]
he throws it in a word or two.

[01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:23.870]
And the albino and little short twerpie kid,

[01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:24.870]
they're in there just to fill it out.

[01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:25.130]
I guess.

[01:40:25.230 --> 01:40:25.530]
I don't know.

[01:40:25.890 --> 01:40:26.590]
To make it look kosher.

[01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:29.110]
600 open lines here today.

[01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:30.070]
567.

[01:40:30.670 --> 01:40:30.950]
0560.

[01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:32.970]
Palm 560 on a mobile line.

[01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:34.570]
It's really great, man.

[01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:36.590]
The most fun is being self-immolated

[01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:38.030]
inside of God damn thing.

[01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:40.590]
Here's a dear field beach call.

[01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.870]

[01:40:41.230 --> 01:40:42.090]
Hey, what's going on?

[01:40:42.210 --> 01:40:42.830]
Not much, pal.

[01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:46.030]
I'll make this quick since your phone lines are obviously jammed.

[01:40:46.050 --> 01:40:47.010]
Oh, yeah, they're smoking, huh?

[01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:47.830]
Oh, yeah.

[01:40:48.450 --> 01:40:49.570]
I have three quick things.

[01:40:49.970 --> 01:40:52.030]
One, if you ever heard of Bill Hicks.

[01:40:52.490 --> 01:40:53.150]
Bill Hicks?

[01:40:53.410 --> 01:40:53.550]
Yeah.

[01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:55.210]
Somebody sent me something and stuff.

[01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:56.150]
I never got to listen to it.

[01:40:56.170 --> 01:40:56.430]
I did.

[01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:57.670]
Is it?

[01:40:57.850 --> 01:40:58.490]
You'd like it.

[01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:59.470]
It's the same kind of stuff.

[01:40:59.970 --> 01:41:01.750]
Same flux that you have on religion

[01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:03.650]
and, you know, legalization of drugs

[01:41:03.650 --> 01:41:05.190]
and for life and all that crap.

[01:41:05.290 --> 01:41:06.050]
Did you like Tom Green?

[01:41:06.850 --> 01:41:07.250]
No.

[01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:09.990]
Nobody's like Tom Green.

[01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:11.270]
No, no one is.

[01:41:11.490 --> 01:41:15.410]
And number two is that this summer has sucked so much ass.

[01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:17.290]
It is so dead out here.

[01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.830]

[01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:19.010]
I look up.

[01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:20.030]
I look up side.

[01:41:20.130 --> 01:41:20.850]
There's like nothing.

[01:41:21.650 --> 01:41:23.510]
I'm really going to split my wrist here.

[01:41:23.570 --> 01:41:24.090]
You know something?

[01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:25.610]
And now that you mentioned it,

[01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:28.090]
I've been thinking this every day when I back out of the garage

[01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:28.650]
to come to work.

[01:41:29.250 --> 01:41:30.290]
My neighborhood is like,

[01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:32.110]
like everybody either went away or they all died.

[01:41:32.110 --> 01:41:34.290]
There's not even a dog on the street.

[01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:36.330]
There's no sign of life anywhere down here.

[01:41:36.330 --> 01:41:36.550]
I know.

[01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:38.810]
I can watch a flare gun and nobody would see it.

[01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:39.450]
Exactly.

[01:41:40.830 --> 01:41:44.270]
Lastly, I have a special song for our favorite person,

[01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:45.550]
Wayne Heizanga,

[01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:48.010]
to the tune of O Canada.

[01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.470]
Yeah.

[01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:52.270]
Oh sperm for lunch.

[01:41:53.110 --> 01:41:56.870]
It's Wayne Heizanga's favorite dish.

[01:41:57.290 --> 01:41:57.690]
Word's Quirk.

[01:41:58.230 --> 01:42:01.070]
Oh sperm for lunch.

[01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:04.470]
It crusts on its upper lip.

[01:42:05.050 --> 01:42:05.450]
Oh.

[01:42:06.210 --> 01:42:07.450]
And that does it for me.

[01:42:07.770 --> 01:42:08.170]
Okay.

[01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.770]
Everything.

[01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:09.410]
Okay.

[01:42:09.530 --> 01:42:10.290]
There you go.

[01:42:11.630 --> 01:42:13.490]
You said Wayne's a crusty old fart.

[01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:14.170]
What's wrong with that?

[01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:16.450]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[01:42:16.810 --> 01:42:18.370]
Is there anybody alive out there?

[01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.570]
No.

[01:42:18.610 --> 01:42:20.090]
Is there anybody living and breathing?

[01:42:20.210 --> 01:42:20.430]
No.

[01:42:20.430 --> 01:42:22.670]
It wasn't just obsessed with that stupid oblong object

[01:42:22.670 --> 01:42:23.210]
called a football.

[01:42:24.110 --> 01:42:25.230]
Oh, it's football time.

[01:42:25.290 --> 01:42:25.610]
That's football.

[01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:26.470]
I do that as football.

[01:42:27.370 --> 01:42:28.910]
No, I'm not, to be honest with you.

[01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:30.690]
And yes, I'll probably watch some games again this year.

[01:42:30.690 --> 01:42:32.050]
Like I had last two or three years,

[01:42:32.130 --> 01:42:33.670]
but with much less interest than ever before,

[01:42:33.810 --> 01:42:35.310]
because it's getting really pondering

[01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:37.970]
and terminal and weak and watered down.

[01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:39.130]
And just awful.

[01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:40.930]
Not as awful as baseball,

[01:42:41.210 --> 01:42:42.250]
but it's catching up fast.

[01:42:44.230 --> 01:42:45.910]
And give Gary Bebina a couple more years

[01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:48.210]
when we have 722 teams in the NHL.

[01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:49.330]
And we'll be right up with them.

[01:42:50.190 --> 01:42:51.830]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:54.350]
Palm 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:56.330]
This audience wouldn't know 98 degrees.

[01:42:56.650 --> 01:42:59.110]
If it was, if they came to knock it on their door right now.

[01:43:00.230 --> 01:43:02.490]
Would that chick with a gigantic enormous hooters?

[01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:03.890]
And I think those were real too, by the way.

[01:43:04.090 --> 01:43:04.670]
Aldi Landry.

[01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:06.630]
That's the Dorito girl.

[01:43:07.670 --> 01:43:09.330]
Does she came to Tom Landry, I think?

[01:43:09.450 --> 01:43:10.050]
Oh, yeah.

[01:43:10.150 --> 01:43:11.490]
Let's get that football pie in there.

[01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:12.770]
That'll make these bastards up.

[01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:15.110]
Here's Halendale.

[01:43:15.230 --> 01:43:15.330]
Hello.

[01:43:15.930 --> 01:43:16.170]
Neil.

[01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.730]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:19.150]
Did you have an award to show on Channel 7 last

[01:43:19.150 --> 01:43:20.690]
when he signs from God?

[01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:21.970]
No.

[01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:23.310]
Oh, Neil.

[01:43:23.650 --> 01:43:25.410]
Two hours, the most fantastic,

[01:43:25.810 --> 01:43:27.130]
fascinating show I've ever watched.

[01:43:27.650 --> 01:43:29.530]
It proves to me to be on a shadow of a doubt

[01:43:29.530 --> 01:43:31.150]
that the keyword of life is temporary.

[01:43:32.010 --> 01:43:32.970]
You didn't watch it.

[01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:33.990]
You'll get a video over it.

[01:43:34.010 --> 01:43:34.490]
When you're pleased.

[01:43:34.730 --> 01:43:34.870]
No.

[01:43:35.170 --> 01:43:36.770]
We're going to convert Neil Rogers.

[01:43:37.150 --> 01:43:37.210]
Please.

[01:43:37.670 --> 01:43:38.070]
Yeah, huh?

[01:43:38.410 --> 01:43:39.290]
Okay, hold your breath, pal.

[01:43:39.450 --> 01:43:39.630]
No.

[01:43:40.210 --> 01:43:40.770]
Okay, squeeze this.

[01:43:41.490 --> 01:43:43.010]
Okay, 1,600 open lines.

[01:43:43.210 --> 01:43:44.690]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:46.910]
Palm 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:48.910]
Take your fairy tales in your bubble-mysies, pal.

[01:43:49.210 --> 01:43:50.350]
And have a great time with them, okay?

[01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:52.710]
Just sit in the back of the room with your thumb

[01:43:52.710 --> 01:43:53.330]
and your mouth going.

[01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:55.510]
And have a wonderful time.

[01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:56.930]
Here's a mobile invoker.

[01:43:57.050 --> 01:43:57.190]
Hello.

[01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:58.510]
Hey, Mr. Neil.

[01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:59.170]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:59.650 --> 01:44:02.150]
Hey, wanted to give you a report on the Blair Cracked

[01:44:02.150 --> 01:44:02.670]
project.

[01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:04.970]
And it was okay.

[01:44:05.290 --> 01:44:06.670]
It was a pretty original film,

[01:44:06.910 --> 01:44:07.950]
but pretty much, you know,

[01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:09.490]
the guy made it for about 20,000 bucks.

[01:44:10.090 --> 01:44:12.130]
And I looked like you're watching an episode of cops

[01:44:12.130 --> 01:44:13.010]
for about two hours.

[01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:16.030]
So, you know, just have one camera bouncing around.

[01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:18.130]
And I'm just conversational of these kids.

[01:44:18.130 --> 01:44:19.810]
And it's kind of scary in a couple of parts,

[01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:22.010]
but most of it, it's pretty bad.

[01:44:22.670 --> 01:44:23.250]
Pretty weak.

[01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:23.930]
Yep.

[01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:25.170]
Okay, thanks for the good news.

[01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:27.750]
All right. I remember several years ago, many years ago,

[01:44:27.810 --> 01:44:29.410]
they were doing a thing on the about 10 years ago

[01:44:29.410 --> 01:44:32.390]
on the TV news with that puke can.

[01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:33.090]
Remember that?

[01:44:33.850 --> 01:44:34.950]
And they were trying to down there.

[01:44:35.230 --> 01:44:36.130]
And then they would do a story.

[01:44:36.210 --> 01:44:37.790]
And the camera would be bouncing around it.

[01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:39.330]
And you felt like you were getting vertigo,

[01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:40.470]
like you were ready to pass out, you know,

[01:44:40.650 --> 01:44:41.830]
like seasick without the ship.

[01:44:43.730 --> 01:44:45.550]
You were getting sick to your stomach without

[01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:46.630]
Mickey Harrison helping you out.

[01:44:47.210 --> 01:44:48.550]
Although I see his pus always named.

[01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:50.450]
And I always start getting sick to my stomach.

[01:44:52.590 --> 01:44:54.210]
And that lasted about three or four weeks.

[01:44:54.210 --> 01:44:55.770]
And then all of a sudden, it vanished real fast.

[01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:56.870]
I guess I had too many complaints.

[01:44:57.230 --> 01:44:58.130]
And what's the purpose?

[01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:59.470]
Is it RT-Fart-C?

[01:44:59.550 --> 01:44:59.670]
No.

[01:44:59.770 --> 01:45:00.410]
Is that the idea?

[01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.670]
No.

[01:45:00.730 --> 01:45:01.290]
No, it is not.

[01:45:01.450 --> 01:45:02.770]
It's nauseating and puke-inducing.

[01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:03.950]
It makes you sick to your stomach.

[01:45:05.370 --> 01:45:06.690]
See, one of the,

[01:45:06.690 --> 01:45:08.350]
what the subtle intellectuals,

[01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:11.550]
RT-Fart-C covers up a lot as opposed to content.

[01:45:11.890 --> 01:45:12.730]
Give me the content.

[01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:14.510]
You can have the RT-Fart-C stuff.

[01:45:14.590 --> 01:45:15.570]
Okay, I'm not in that.

[01:45:15.870 --> 01:45:16.710]
I don't care about that.

[01:45:19.170 --> 01:45:19.750]
Here's Hollywood.

[01:45:19.950 --> 01:45:20.090]
Hello.

[01:45:22.130 --> 01:45:22.870]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:25.350]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:45:25.490 --> 01:45:25.570]
Hello.

[01:45:26.290 --> 01:45:27.170]
Yeah, how you doing, Neil?

[01:45:27.270 --> 01:45:27.690]
Okay, sir.

[01:45:28.230 --> 01:45:29.950]
Say, Neil, I don't know whether you're aware of this or not.

[01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:32.050]
But the state of Florida intends to spray a fungus

[01:45:32.050 --> 01:45:33.210]
over the entire state.

[01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:33.870]
Yes, I am, too.

[01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:34.890]
Eliminate the wicked weed.

[01:45:34.990 --> 01:45:35.650]
Yes, I am, sir.

[01:45:36.210 --> 01:45:38.830]
And I just hope the people stand up because, uh,

[01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.110]
they do.

[01:45:39.110 --> 01:45:40.890]
What do you mean you hope the people stand up?

[01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:41.910]
They're not going to stand up.

[01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:43.410]
They're going to lay down like they always do.

[01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.950]
Well, you're right, Neil.

[01:45:45.090 --> 01:45:45.710]
And isn't that a shame?

[01:45:46.090 --> 01:45:47.270]
I clipped the article about it.

[01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:48.270]
I don't know if I still have that here.

[01:45:48.270 --> 01:45:48.850]
I got it somewhere.

[01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:51.970]
The rest of the country's shocked and surprised

[01:45:51.970 --> 01:45:54.350]
by this move because it may actually kill all the tomatoes

[01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:55.270]
in Florida also.

[01:45:55.390 --> 01:45:56.390]
Yeah, we don't care about that.

[01:45:56.530 --> 01:45:58.010]
So this is still, this is the same state

[01:45:58.010 --> 01:45:59.470]
where we started with a periquot crap

[01:45:59.470 --> 01:46:01.050]
which it was poisoning all the people.

[01:46:01.290 --> 01:46:01.950]
That serves them right.

[01:46:02.010 --> 01:46:03.830]
If they're going to smoke that wicked weed like we're doing in here

[01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:05.770]
right now, then they ought to die from a self-denial.

[01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:07.390]
No, it's not fair, Neil.

[01:46:07.390 --> 01:46:08.950]
They have to die after the roast is the liquor

[01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:11.250]
and alcohol poisoning instead because drinking is okay.

[01:46:11.250 --> 01:46:12.630]
You can beat your wife, wreck your car.

[01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:13.510]
That's not work.

[01:46:13.670 --> 01:46:15.370]
Just ask those opportunities at MIT

[01:46:15.370 --> 01:46:16.670]
that I'll tell you, drinking is good for it.

[01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:18.870]
Well, I don't know what to say, Neil,

[01:46:18.910 --> 01:46:20.210]
but I got to go because I got to light up one.

[01:46:20.410 --> 01:46:21.430]
Okay, have a great day, pal.

[01:46:23.010 --> 01:46:24.130]
Country, let me say it again.

[01:46:24.370 --> 01:46:25.370]
Here's a country where we got,

[01:46:25.530 --> 01:46:27.250]
and they had a piece on 60 minutes last night,

[01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:29.110]
which nobody has called about about the assault weapons.

[01:46:29.610 --> 01:46:31.750]
And we'll hold that assault weapons band five years ago

[01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:32.530]
what a joke it is.

[01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:33.970]
And there's more from, in fact,

[01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:35.490]
the gun show that Leslie Stahl was

[01:46:35.490 --> 01:46:36.450]
when they started the show,

[01:46:36.710 --> 01:46:38.330]
guess where it was right here in Miami?

[01:46:38.970 --> 01:46:39.530]
How do you like that?

[01:46:40.650 --> 01:46:42.890]
They started that segment on 60 minutes life

[01:46:42.890 --> 01:46:44.270]
that had a gun show right here in town,

[01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:45.170]
which by the way,

[01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:47.250]
we're always advertising that crap here on the station.

[01:46:47.250 --> 01:46:48.730]
I'm very sorry in apologize for it,

[01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:49.890]
but I have no control over it.

[01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:52.890]
To joke.

[01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:57.410]
So that's okay to have the only assault weapons out there,

[01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:58.590]
even the ones with a bayonet.

[01:46:58.730 --> 01:47:01.210]
The bayonet ones, well, that's not too crazy about that.

[01:47:03.090 --> 01:47:05.430]
We all have to have a weapon with a bayonet on a doughing

[01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:06.930]
to be safe, just to be sure.

[01:47:08.970 --> 01:47:10.450]
But those people are running run on a loose,

[01:47:10.570 --> 01:47:11.470]
the people who are selling them,

[01:47:11.470 --> 01:47:12.230]
the people manufacturing,

[01:47:12.230 --> 01:47:14.230]
and most of the people that are killing people with them,

[01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:15.190]
they're running run on a loose.

[01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:17.670]
But the evil people, the marijuana people,

[01:47:17.890 --> 01:47:19.850]
they've got all the jail cells in America filled up.

[01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:22.110]
That's why they had to let that guy out in Texas,

[01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:23.530]
who murdered the three teenagers

[01:47:23.530 --> 01:47:24.930]
so we could kill all those girls again.

[01:47:26.290 --> 01:47:28.670]
Because they got to, you got to pre-up some Roman adjails.

[01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:30.210]
Keep the wicked weed people in there.

[01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:30.750]
They're dangerous,

[01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:32.450]
but the murderers let them out for a while.

[01:47:32.530 --> 01:47:33.110]
Give them a free pass.

[01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:35.090]
Let John Hinkley have a couple of weekend passes.

[01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:38.110]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[01:47:38.290 --> 01:47:39.890]
pound 5, 60 on a mobile one line.

[01:47:40.610 --> 01:47:41.650]
Here's a mobile in Miramar.

[01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.970]
Hello.

[01:47:42.890 --> 01:47:44.250]
Okay, nice talking to you too.

[01:47:44.770 --> 01:47:45.770]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:47:45.970 --> 01:47:46.130]
Hello.

[01:47:46.710 --> 01:47:47.370]
Hello, me.

[01:47:47.650 --> 01:47:47.930]
Yes.

[01:47:48.410 --> 01:47:49.090]
Yeah, how you doing?

[01:47:49.090 --> 01:47:49.690]
Okay.

[01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:50.870]
This is a Julio.

[01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.850]
Nio, you know,

[01:47:53.310 --> 01:47:55.950]
has anyone called you concerning this old news?

[01:47:56.130 --> 01:47:57.530]
But I don't know if you know about it.

[01:47:57.670 --> 01:47:59.470]
About Jeff Bush's wife

[01:48:00.190 --> 01:48:02.030]
with a scam that she had in Paris.

[01:48:02.210 --> 01:48:04.290]
That she wasted, she said she wasted 600 dollars.

[01:48:04.890 --> 01:48:05.450]
Oh.

[01:48:18.610 --> 01:48:19.170]
Wow.

[01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:24.050]
This is a little bit behind the times, he said.

[01:48:24.990 --> 01:48:28.430]
And by the way, President Lincoln's head is still thriving, he said.

[01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:36.510]
Hello, soccer.

[01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:40.610]
My name is Colamba.

[01:48:40.810 --> 01:48:45.130]
I got up the plane after shopping in front to knit your money away.

[01:48:45.490 --> 01:48:48.390]
I bought designer clothes, expensive bubbles and jewels.

[01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:51.970]
And you in advance said, do things tax with you.

[01:48:52.670 --> 01:48:54.410]
I tried very hard to smuggle.

[01:48:55.410 --> 01:48:57.350]
And they wouldn't let me buy.

[01:48:58.630 --> 01:49:00.690]
But I did not get in trouble.

[01:49:01.610 --> 01:49:01.770]
No.

[01:49:01.770 --> 01:49:04.030]
So I said, God, I know why.

[01:49:04.530 --> 01:49:05.350]
Get some Jeopardy!

[01:49:05.670 --> 01:49:08.570]
You might want to live up my life with such a table.

[01:49:09.970 --> 01:49:15.310]
After all, my husband brother will soon be your dictator.

[01:49:17.070 --> 01:49:21.510]
I'd like to have a dinner by anything I need and just one thing more.

[01:49:22.610 --> 01:49:27.590]
I'll be just risk his family now you when I get that from the store.

[01:49:28.250 --> 01:49:29.810]
Oh, right.

[01:49:29.810 --> 01:49:32.010]
All right. She just, she's very, very subtle.

[01:49:32.210 --> 01:49:33.190]
She'd be beddy, beddy, sunny.

[01:49:36.030 --> 01:49:39.910]
There wasn't no farmer who's lived on a rock.

[01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:40.210]
Oh!

[01:49:40.410 --> 01:49:44.770]
He's adding the metal just shaking his face at some boy.

[01:49:44.770 --> 01:49:46.830]
You were down by the crink.

[01:49:47.210 --> 01:49:51.890]
There be in the water there, hands on their marbles and play things.

[01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:53.590]
And I'd have passed four.

[01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:55.530]
There's people, young lady.

[01:49:55.890 --> 01:49:58.570]
She looked like a pretty young creature.

[01:49:58.570 --> 01:50:00.410]
She sat on the grass.

[01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:07.610]
She pulled up her dress and she showed them her rubbles and laces and white fluffy ducts.

[01:50:07.690 --> 01:50:13.990]
She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children so they would not spin.

[01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:17.570]
While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling,

[01:50:17.690 --> 01:50:20.910]
Reptusin litter from yesterday's heart.

[01:50:21.230 --> 01:50:24.310]
While the girl in the meadow was rubbing her,

[01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:27.610]
I let the fellow down by the knot.

[01:50:27.930 --> 01:50:34.390]
He looked like a man with a side of a home in the country with a big fence out front.

[01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:41.210]
If he has her phone lightly, she'd show him her little bet dog who was subject to bits.

[01:50:41.770 --> 01:50:48.050]
And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her small tender and with a movement so quick.

[01:50:48.050 --> 01:50:51.350]
And then she'd bend over and suck down.

[01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:54.830]
It's candy, so tasty made of butter, Scott.

[01:50:55.370 --> 01:51:01.690]
And then he spread the cream all over her cookie that she had left out on her shelf.

[01:51:02.150 --> 01:51:05.530]
If you think this is dirty, you can go for yourself.

[01:51:05.630 --> 01:51:06.010]
All right.

[01:51:06.190 --> 01:51:09.730]
23 and 560 WQ and our facts machines have a little bit of a problem here.

[01:51:09.850 --> 01:51:13.210]
Here's one from Chris who's writing about fraternities and looks like Chris might

[01:51:13.210 --> 01:51:16.710]
have had something interesting to say, but it's all distorted in here.

[01:51:18.170 --> 01:51:21.970]
He says there are 12-year-old boys with more maturity than what goes on in their fraternities,

[01:51:22.090 --> 01:51:23.670]
fraternities, and that's all I can read.

[01:51:25.130 --> 01:51:28.010]
So maybe you can refact that to me, Chris, because it seems like it's kind of interesting,

[01:51:28.130 --> 01:51:28.770]
but I can't read it.

[01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:31.090]
And then here's one that says, Mr. Rogers, I'm on a irregular listeners.

[01:51:31.130 --> 01:51:32.370]
However, I'm too embarrassed to call.

[01:51:32.590 --> 01:51:32.750]
I have.

[01:51:33.410 --> 01:51:34.490]
And then it's.

[01:51:35.010 --> 01:51:35.610]
That's you know that.

[01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:39.010]
So our facts machine, maybe it's having a little bit of problem or maybe it's on the outside.

[01:51:39.330 --> 01:51:39.650]
Or who knows?

[01:51:39.770 --> 01:51:40.870]
Maybe it's a common is plot.

[01:51:41.210 --> 01:51:44.930]
Or maybe it's the beer, maybe it's the Blair Witch project that's got something to do with it.

[01:51:45.090 --> 01:51:46.970]
Or maybe it's the Tupacabra, you think that might be it?

[01:51:47.010 --> 01:51:47.790]
That could be it.

[01:51:49.190 --> 01:51:50.270]
Or it could be Superman.

[01:51:50.610 --> 01:51:51.610]
That's what Johnny Ola said.

[01:51:55.150 --> 01:51:57.650]
Here's the Dan and for a lot of the other day who says about these sopranos,

[01:51:57.810 --> 01:52:01.250]
he says HBO probably bought that award for more promotion, just like Rocky.

[01:52:03.570 --> 01:52:04.150]
That's what I'm saying.

[01:52:04.370 --> 01:52:06.890]
PS didn't know the idiot Jack Cassline was open today.

[01:52:07.190 --> 01:52:08.230]
Oh, it's open today, Dan.

[01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:09.330]
It's open every day.

[01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:09.770]
No waiting.

[01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:14.370]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pond 5 60 on a mobile one line.

[01:52:14.710 --> 01:52:17.750]
I think it's appropriate that when you have a sales department like we've got here that knows

[01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:21.250]
nothing about writing copy that gives us absolutely nothing to work with.

[01:52:21.490 --> 01:52:25.530]
We should have an idiot Jack Cassline and hook it directly to the sales department's collective rectum.

[01:52:25.690 --> 01:52:26.690]
What I think is a good idea.

[01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:30.150]
They got a lot of experience talking through their ass.

[01:52:31.070 --> 01:52:31.690]
Here's Miramar.

[01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:32.030]
Hello.

[01:52:33.850 --> 01:52:34.290]
Miramar.

[01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:35.610]
Hey Neil.

[01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:36.150]
Yes sir.

[01:52:36.330 --> 01:52:38.290]
I got some good news for you today.

[01:52:38.290 --> 01:52:39.270]
I have a 30.

[01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:42.570]
Everybody around the world is going to spark one up.

[01:52:44.430 --> 01:52:44.730]
Yeah.

[01:52:45.250 --> 01:52:45.930]
And uh,

[01:52:46.810 --> 01:52:48.350]
Sal and Lake Forest.

[01:52:48.650 --> 01:52:48.930]
Okay.

[01:52:49.670 --> 01:52:51.830]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pond.

[01:52:52.010 --> 01:52:53.430]
There you go Dan and for a lot of dollars.

[01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:54.310]
You answer no waiting.

[01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:58.970]
I told you 5 6 7 0 5 60 pond 5 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:52:59.490 --> 01:53:00.570]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:53:00.730 --> 01:53:00.910]
Hello.

[01:53:02.050 --> 01:53:02.710]
Father Neil.

[01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.330]
Yes sir.

[01:53:04.370 --> 01:53:06.010]
What is wrong with this epin show today?

[01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:07.550]
Meaning what?

[01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:10.410]
I mean just the calls are pitiful.

[01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:10.770]
Yeah.

[01:53:10.970 --> 01:53:11.410]
So is that mean?

[01:53:11.410 --> 01:53:12.450]
I mean, we're just still time.

[01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:13.610]
Why don't you play that uh,

[01:53:13.690 --> 01:53:14.770]
silence of the land bit.

[01:53:15.130 --> 01:53:16.370]
We'll kill some more time with that.

[01:53:16.590 --> 01:53:18.510]
It's one of these Jackass calls out of the way.

[01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:22.370]
And I don't know.

[01:53:22.450 --> 01:53:24.630]
Maybe something will turn around for us in the next hour and a half.

[01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:25.230]
Uh huh.

[01:53:25.810 --> 01:53:26.110]
No.

[01:53:27.650 --> 01:53:30.830]
Is that the lamest attempt that I've requested you ever heard in your life?

[01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:31.090]
Uh huh.

[01:53:31.110 --> 01:53:31.930]
Was that was that pretty weak?

[01:53:32.190 --> 01:53:32.350]
Yeah.

[01:53:32.690 --> 01:53:33.510]
Oh god.

[01:53:34.650 --> 01:53:35.730]
Hey, word, well, you know,

[01:53:35.730 --> 01:53:38.450]
if you go through 20 or 30,000 calls like I've always said,

[01:53:38.490 --> 01:53:39.630]
you come up with a couple of these ones.

[01:53:39.870 --> 01:53:41.370]
People that might actually have something interesting.

[01:53:41.650 --> 01:53:43.990]
I'm using a provocative anything at all.

[01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.930]
That's what we're doing.

[01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:45.770]
We do this every day.

[01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:47.090]
What are you talking about today pal?

[01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:50.470]
Like this is something new and unusual.

[01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:52.750]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:53.170]
There you go.

[01:53:53.250 --> 01:53:54.510]
That should tide you over for a little while.

[01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:56.150]
Here's Pemberpine.

[01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.450]
Hello.

[01:53:56.730 --> 01:53:57.170]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:53:57.310 --> 01:53:57.750]
Okay, sir.

[01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:58.870]
What's that guy's feeling about?

[01:53:58.950 --> 01:54:00.090]
He's one of the worst calls in the day.

[01:54:00.210 --> 01:54:01.090]
Exactly right.

[01:54:01.230 --> 01:54:02.750]
There's a guy that had nothing to say at all.

[01:54:03.050 --> 01:54:04.450]
And what's going on with his shoulder?

[01:54:05.110 --> 01:54:06.530]
You had no material whatsoever.

[01:54:06.690 --> 01:54:07.470]
You were talking about that.

[01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:09.390]
But, okay, first off, I want to say,

[01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:10.810]
congratulations last week on the tax.

[01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:11.550]
And so I was out of time.

[01:54:11.730 --> 01:54:11.990]
You're going to change the tax.

[01:54:12.010 --> 01:54:13.290]
Well, I was a hero last week,

[01:54:13.410 --> 01:54:14.730]
but now it's Monday, so I'm a bum.

[01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:16.210]
You know, I think the way this town is.

[01:54:16.270 --> 01:54:17.230]
What did you do for me lately?

[01:54:17.410 --> 01:54:18.270]
I know I think you're zero,

[01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:21.530]
which is like, we think we're proct annuals rating is,

[01:54:21.570 --> 01:54:23.750]
but anyway, first off,

[01:54:27.130 --> 01:54:30.550]
yeah, exactly.

[01:54:30.810 --> 01:54:32.810]
But yeah, I don't know what to do.

[01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:33.450]
I'm going to school.

[01:54:34.570 --> 01:54:35.710]
She's ecstatic that she actually

[01:54:35.710 --> 01:54:37.210]
is on a show with an audience now.

[01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:39.970]
I think she gets excited when we just even mention her.

[01:54:43.190 --> 01:54:44.130]
That's exactly it.

[01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:45.310]
But yeah, I just want to say,

[01:54:45.410 --> 01:54:46.290]
you're talking about this one

[01:54:46.290 --> 01:54:48.350]
about like these terminal football people and everything.

[01:54:48.650 --> 01:54:48.650]

[01:54:49.130 --> 01:54:50.710]
My gosh, I can't even turn it on.

[01:54:50.810 --> 01:54:51.610]
When I go to school in the morning,

[01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:53.430]
I can't even listen to that crap in the morning.

[01:54:53.790 --> 01:54:55.630]
I mean, I would much rather listen to, I think.

[01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:57.350]
I mean, they're getting all bent out of shape

[01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:58.730]
about what happened in a scrimmage.

[01:54:58.770 --> 01:55:00.190]
And this one got into a brawl,

[01:55:00.210 --> 01:55:01.810]
and this one got a little bent out of shape.

[01:55:01.810 --> 01:55:03.130]
Who gives a crap?

[01:55:03.330 --> 01:55:05.170]
I mean, if that's the best you can do,

[01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:06.610]
it's time to turn out the lights.

[01:55:06.810 --> 01:55:07.310]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:55:07.450 --> 01:55:08.410]
If you get to pre-season games,

[01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:09.610]
we're playing against different teams.

[01:55:09.730 --> 01:55:10.750]
I guess our own team, really.

[01:55:11.170 --> 01:55:11.550]
I mean, really.

[01:55:12.010 --> 01:55:13.710]
But yeah, Eddie Kay did post-Azio

[01:55:13.710 --> 01:55:15.310]
the night on that Gary Sarner fight.

[01:55:15.570 --> 01:55:15.750]
Yeah.

[01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:17.290]
He gave two to one on Gary Sarner.

[01:55:17.490 --> 01:55:17.650]
Yeah.

[01:55:18.030 --> 01:55:18.410]
And so,

[01:55:18.930 --> 01:55:20.690]
that's what Lee Cutler was sitting down

[01:55:20.690 --> 01:55:21.450]
through this morning,

[01:55:21.570 --> 01:55:23.070]
no signing of Gary so.

[01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:25.710]
Okay, two requests.

[01:55:26.110 --> 01:55:27.470]
Just start off on what he called somebody a douchebag.

[01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:29.290]
Pat Rally over in Fort Myers,

[01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:30.970]
or a big fat flaming douchebag.

[01:55:31.530 --> 01:55:32.130]
And number two,

[01:55:32.250 --> 01:55:33.250]
can we play a managed thing?

[01:55:33.810 --> 01:55:34.410]
Okay, great.

[01:55:34.630 --> 01:55:35.310]
Love you to see you.

[01:55:36.030 --> 01:55:37.410]
Yeah, he said, can we play?

[01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:38.450]
Didn't say would you play it?

[01:55:39.150 --> 01:55:40.670]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[01:55:40.830 --> 01:55:42.630]
pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:44.130]
We're pissed off and fired up today,

[01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:44.510]
baby.

[01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:46.370]
I'm not sure about what about those guy,

[01:55:46.410 --> 01:55:47.490]
they have college fraternities.

[01:55:47.890 --> 01:55:49.150]
They're banning him starting now,

[01:55:49.150 --> 01:55:49.570]
by the way.

[01:55:49.650 --> 01:55:51.410]
This fall, when your kids go back to school,

[01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:53.110]
all your fraternities are going to be shut down.

[01:55:54.730 --> 01:55:56.830]
And we here at WQM are going to make sure

[01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:57.770]
that they're shut down,

[01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:59.410]
because no more of this hazing,

[01:55:59.410 --> 01:56:00.830]
no more of this gazing,

[01:56:01.090 --> 01:56:03.850]
no more of this gay banter that goes on there,

[01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:05.450]
whatever the crap is going on in there.

[01:56:06.190 --> 01:56:07.450]
Running around in your underwear.

[01:56:09.490 --> 01:56:10.930]
Let me say it one more time,

[01:56:11.050 --> 01:56:12.530]
just in case you missed it the first time,

[01:56:12.530 --> 01:56:13.050]
or you don't know,

[01:56:13.210 --> 01:56:14.270]
speak it in English, okay?

[01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:16.290]
When a bunch of young college age guys

[01:56:16.290 --> 01:56:17.910]
are running around in their underwear,

[01:56:18.170 --> 01:56:19.430]
playing grab ass with each other,

[01:56:19.490 --> 01:56:20.090]
you know what that is?

[01:56:20.330 --> 01:56:21.910]
That's a deep club you moron.

[01:56:22.210 --> 01:56:22.570]
Right.

[01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:25.810]
And don't give me any debate on it, okay?

[01:56:26.510 --> 01:56:27.710]
So if you want to start some

[01:56:27.710 --> 01:56:30.050]
fag fraternity, which they do have those I understand,

[01:56:30.670 --> 01:56:31.390]
that's one thing.

[01:56:32.010 --> 01:56:33.650]
But let's at least have some truth in packaging.

[01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:35.910]
At least put some truth in your package

[01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:37.310]
before you start squeezing it.

[01:56:38.230 --> 01:56:39.150]
What's your phony baloney?

[01:56:39.450 --> 01:56:41.770]
What's your overgrown pre-adolescence?

[01:56:41.890 --> 01:56:42.690]
Much of juveniles,

[01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:44.630]
were like 19 and 20, go it on 12.

[01:56:44.810 --> 01:56:45.450]
That's the problem.

[01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:47.630]
Only that one kid,

[01:56:47.970 --> 01:56:50.090]
he's still 19 and two years later.

[01:56:50.430 --> 01:56:50.990]
He's not aging.

[01:56:52.650 --> 01:56:53.710]
Oh, look at what we got.

[01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:54.850]
It's totally embarrassing.

[01:56:55.290 --> 01:56:56.870]
Yes, go out with him.

[01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:57.470]
It's a man.

[01:56:57.670 --> 01:56:58.610]
It's a love man.

[01:56:58.630 --> 01:56:59.070]
That kid.

[01:56:59.410 --> 01:56:59.770]
So what?

[01:56:59.890 --> 01:57:01.530]
It's the psychic psychopnoir.

[01:57:01.650 --> 01:57:02.330]
It's so grippin'.

[01:57:02.330 --> 01:57:03.450]
It's only gonna come my friends to golf.

[01:57:03.850 --> 01:57:04.830]
Are you attracted to your leaf?

[01:57:04.830 --> 01:57:05.390]
I think so.

[01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:06.190]
Oh my god.

[01:57:06.450 --> 01:57:07.230]
And you know something,

[01:57:07.330 --> 01:57:08.290]
you imagine the amount of money

[01:57:08.290 --> 01:57:09.470]
that they're raking in with that crap?

[01:57:10.090 --> 01:57:11.310]
People who call psychics.

[01:57:11.550 --> 01:57:12.190]
And you talk about,

[01:57:12.330 --> 01:57:13.570]
you wonder why this guy in Atlanta

[01:57:13.570 --> 01:57:14.930]
went nuts and shot all these people?

[01:57:15.450 --> 01:57:16.130]
And you're saying,

[01:57:16.330 --> 01:57:18.090]
oh, there's a lot of crazy people out there.

[01:57:19.010 --> 01:57:20.490]
And there are people that are sending their money

[01:57:20.490 --> 01:57:21.670]
to Janet Paul Crocs.

[01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:22.690]
And people sending their money

[01:57:22.690 --> 01:57:24.070]
to the psychic die-cat line.

[01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:27.410]
We're talking millions is what we're talking about.

[01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:29.010]
Are you Aaron?

[01:57:29.230 --> 01:57:30.030]
Shit like this.

[01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:32.610]
The mad dog is out of control

[01:57:32.610 --> 01:57:34.170]
and you'll find out why.

[01:57:34.410 --> 01:57:35.950]
Would you hear the latest release

[01:57:35.950 --> 01:57:37.490]
from Blackbusters Entertainment?

[01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:38.150]
Oh, right.

[01:57:38.370 --> 01:57:40.550]
Jim Mandage sings duet.

[01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:41.310]
Well, yeah.

[01:57:41.410 --> 01:57:41.690]
Well, yeah.

[01:57:41.690 --> 01:57:42.230]
Oh, right.

[01:57:44.050 --> 01:57:45.750]
Right around and sweet.

[01:57:46.170 --> 01:57:46.850]
Well, yeah.

[01:57:47.070 --> 01:57:47.890]
Oh, right.

[01:57:49.110 --> 01:57:50.250]
Here's the mad dog.

[01:57:50.670 --> 01:57:53.610]
Jim Mandage sings classic rock.

[01:57:54.570 --> 01:57:56.410]
This is all right.

[01:57:58.090 --> 01:57:59.910]
This is all right.

[01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:03.210]
All right.

[01:58:04.030 --> 01:58:06.170]
I'm not waiting for it.

[01:58:06.170 --> 01:58:06.870]
It's all right.

[01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:10.330]
All right.

[01:58:10.930 --> 01:58:11.350]
All right.

[01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:11.630]
All right.

[01:58:12.370 --> 01:58:12.790]
All right.

[01:58:13.210 --> 01:58:14.030]
All right.

[01:58:14.570 --> 01:58:14.950]
All right.

[01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.790]
All right.

[01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:17.550]
Mandage says,

[01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:19.050]
blind fingers.

[01:58:19.410 --> 01:58:20.490]
Well, all right.

[01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:22.670]
Well, all right.

[01:58:27.790 --> 01:58:29.490]
Well, all right.

[01:58:29.890 --> 01:58:31.570]
Well, all right.

[01:58:31.570 --> 01:58:31.570]

[01:58:32.150 --> 01:58:33.630]
All right.

[01:58:34.430 --> 01:58:35.630]
All right.

[01:58:36.410 --> 01:58:36.870]
All right.

[01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:40.030]
And first, Jim said he felt a little bit foolish.

[01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:40.910]
I don't like that.

[01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:42.590]
You nicked in a hole, huh?

[01:58:42.830 --> 01:58:44.870]
But now he said, I like it.

[01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:46.630]
I like it.

[01:58:46.670 --> 01:58:47.010]
Oh, man.

[01:58:47.230 --> 01:58:48.770]
The dog just can't piss it up

[01:58:48.770 --> 01:58:50.350]
with that cottage cheese butt.

[01:58:50.490 --> 01:58:51.450]
If he wants me to sing,

[01:58:51.450 --> 01:58:52.510]
he's got plus America

[01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:54.390]
and pasteies in a jeep string up here.

[01:58:54.530 --> 01:58:55.050]
I'll do it.

[01:58:55.050 --> 01:58:56.330]
You got both.

[01:58:57.030 --> 01:58:58.430]
And then I go.

[01:58:59.170 --> 01:59:00.450]
That is all right.

[01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:02.570]
All right.

[01:59:02.730 --> 01:59:03.810]
Jim's is a mad dog.

[01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:05.050]
Sing him, film happy.

[01:59:05.310 --> 01:59:05.870]
All right.

[01:59:06.430 --> 01:59:07.170]
All right.

[01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:09.430]
All right.

[01:59:09.730 --> 01:59:10.290]
All right.

[01:59:11.050 --> 01:59:11.050]

[01:59:11.050 --> 01:59:11.550]
My mother.

[01:59:12.150 --> 01:59:12.590]
He's mad.

[01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:13.770]
This isn't due yet.

[01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:15.910]
Available now at all Blockbuster Studios.

[01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:16.790]
So what do you think?

[01:59:16.850 --> 01:59:17.290]
All right.

[01:59:17.590 --> 01:59:19.490]
1245 at 560 WQM.

[01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:20.290]
Happy Monday, T.

[01:59:20.290 --> 01:59:22.090]
We're going to make it in spite of this crowd today.

[01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:24.050]
It's kind of dull, you know, like the town.

[01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:26.230]
Like the ambiance of this whole place.

[01:59:27.090 --> 01:59:27.410]
560.

[01:59:27.730 --> 01:59:27.950]
705.

[01:59:28.370 --> 01:59:28.670]
60.

[01:59:29.610 --> 01:59:31.750]
Count 560 on the most prestigious.

[01:59:32.050 --> 01:59:32.490]
What is it?

[01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:33.350]
This is our mobile one line.

[01:59:39.310 --> 01:59:40.830]
OK, let's go to Fort Lauderdale.

[01:59:40.950 --> 01:59:41.070]
Hello.

[01:59:41.610 --> 01:59:41.990]
Hey, Neil.

[01:59:42.130 --> 01:59:42.530]
How are you?

[01:59:42.590 --> 01:59:42.830]
OK.

[01:59:43.090 --> 01:59:43.450]
That's good.

[01:59:43.650 --> 01:59:44.210]
Try to stay awake.

[01:59:44.570 --> 01:59:44.890]
Yeah.

[01:59:45.230 --> 01:59:46.510]
First thing I want to tell you is that you

[01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:47.990]
are the Frank Zappa of radio.

[01:59:48.150 --> 01:59:48.270]
Yeah.

[01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:49.530]
I really appreciate your show.

[01:59:50.090 --> 01:59:51.330]
And the other thing I want to get into

[01:59:51.330 --> 01:59:54.190]
is I was thinking a lot about this global warming thing

[01:59:54.190 --> 01:59:56.130]
that's going on right now with all those people dying

[01:59:56.130 --> 01:59:59.930]
and the northern part of the hemisphere and things like this.

[02:00:00.490 --> 02:00:03.030]
And I was thinking about how Norman Braiman was coming out

[02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:05.290]
so hard against that tax and things like this.

[02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:08.990]
And honestly, I understand that the government in Miami

[02:00:08.990 --> 02:00:11.050]
is very, very corrupt and the reason why

[02:00:11.050 --> 02:00:12.770]
the people didn't want to give them the money is because they

[02:00:12.770 --> 02:00:14.610]
knew they were going to steal it or spend it on something

[02:00:14.610 --> 02:00:15.630]
else or something like this.

[02:00:16.130 --> 02:00:18.690]
But someone like him stands the most to lose here.

[02:00:19.250 --> 02:00:21.370]
And if it came down to the point where the internal combustion

[02:00:21.370 --> 02:00:23.930]
engine had to be abolished or else we were all going to die,

[02:00:24.030 --> 02:00:25.250]
I don't think they would give it up.

[02:00:25.850 --> 02:00:28.010]
I really don't think they would because they don't

[02:00:28.010 --> 02:00:29.470]
have our interest at heart there.

[02:00:29.530 --> 02:00:31.110]
What do you mean he stands to lose the most?

[02:00:31.530 --> 02:00:33.110]
Like somebody faxed the other day.

[02:00:33.390 --> 02:00:35.590]
People who buy the kinds of cars that he sells aren't

[02:00:35.590 --> 02:00:35.930]
sluppers.

[02:00:35.930 --> 02:00:37.310]
They don't ride the metro rail with a bus.

[02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:38.370]
Oh, exactly.

[02:00:39.070 --> 02:00:42.370]
But the whole thing is if we had a decent transit system, OK,

[02:00:42.570 --> 02:00:44.850]
if it came out, if the EPA came out,

[02:00:45.210 --> 02:00:48.190]
and someone said, OK, right now the best thing

[02:00:48.190 --> 02:00:51.270]
we can do for this planet is to not drive around cars

[02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:52.210]
with internal combustion engine.

[02:00:52.210 --> 02:00:53.550]
But they're not going to do that.

[02:00:54.590 --> 02:00:57.510]
But how many people do you see driving electric cars around

[02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:58.270]
today, by the way?

[02:00:58.690 --> 02:01:00.310]
You don't see that many.

[02:01:00.450 --> 02:01:01.870]
I understand what you're saying because you're saying.

[02:01:01.870 --> 02:01:02.810]
I don't see any of them.

[02:01:03.070 --> 02:01:03.270]
Right.

[02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:06.010]
Because how many stations can you go and recharge

[02:01:06.010 --> 02:01:07.750]
your battery in your electric car?

[02:01:08.770 --> 02:01:11.770]
But what I'm saying is is that if it came down to the point

[02:01:11.770 --> 02:01:14.430]
where they said, OK, these emissions are not good, OK?

[02:01:14.690 --> 02:01:16.690]
Which everybody already knows, OK?

[02:01:16.690 --> 02:01:19.150]
We would like to switch to some kind of a mass trend

[02:01:19.150 --> 02:01:21.350]
that which they already have great ideas for like monitoring.

[02:01:21.370 --> 02:01:21.710]
OK.

[02:01:22.150 --> 02:01:22.310]
Yeah.

[02:01:22.730 --> 02:01:23.110]
You know?

[02:01:24.030 --> 02:01:25.910]
And it's like someone like him, of course.

[02:01:25.970 --> 02:01:26.310]
OK.

[02:01:26.930 --> 02:01:27.790]
He's the most balloon.

[02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.910]

[02:01:29.010 --> 02:01:30.370]
Why do you keep repeating that?

[02:01:30.850 --> 02:01:32.210]
Because he's a car dealer.

[02:01:32.330 --> 02:01:34.270]
So you know, I mean, of course, you know?

[02:01:34.270 --> 02:01:35.430]
So let me say this to you, OK?

[02:01:36.090 --> 02:01:38.370]
68% of the people in this town have spoken.

[02:01:38.490 --> 02:01:41.770]
And they have said, no, we're not going to give away $270

[02:01:41.770 --> 02:01:43.890]
million a year for the next 5,000 years.

[02:01:44.050 --> 02:01:46.230]
So then a bunch of crooks can do it with it, OK?

[02:01:46.230 --> 02:01:46.330]
OK?

[02:01:47.010 --> 02:01:48.210]
No, I understand what you're saying.

[02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:48.470]
OK?

[02:01:48.650 --> 02:01:48.890]
OK.

[02:01:51.650 --> 02:01:52.710]
So what's the point?

[02:01:53.150 --> 02:01:53.690]
So what I'm thinking?

[02:01:53.950 --> 02:01:54.370]
That's a nice day.

[02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:55.370]
I mean, you're making me sick.

[02:01:58.290 --> 02:01:59.010]
5,670560.

[02:01:59.210 --> 02:02:02.150]
Guy actually steps up to the plate to quote that little big

[02:02:02.150 --> 02:02:03.190]
year torque rosperelle.

[02:02:03.370 --> 02:02:05.750]
He steps up the plate and rolls up his plate and did, did,

[02:02:06.150 --> 02:02:07.490]
didn't just do, do, he did it.

[02:02:07.670 --> 02:02:08.330]
Nice call, Norman.

[02:02:09.010 --> 02:02:10.730]
I write to a great letter to the editor in the Herald too,

[02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:11.950]
by the way, to top it all off.

[02:02:12.270 --> 02:02:14.510]
And this guy's knocking him because he sells cars.

[02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:16.650]
You know something I hate to break the news to you, sir?

[02:02:16.930 --> 02:02:20.570]
If Norman Braeman never sells another car from this day on,

[02:02:20.650 --> 02:02:22.190]
he's still going to not miss any meals.

[02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:23.230]
But you know what I'm talking about?

[02:02:23.770 --> 02:02:24.870]
He ain't going to go hungry.

[02:02:26.530 --> 02:02:29.050]
He can buy and sell all of us 100 times over,

[02:02:29.110 --> 02:02:30.090]
except for Mickey and Wayne.

[02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:33.650]
And by the way, I hope he sells a lot more cars than Wayne's

[02:02:33.650 --> 02:02:34.810]
doing, if it gets my drift.

[02:02:35.530 --> 02:02:36.590]
Anybody still got that stock?

[02:02:37.050 --> 02:02:37.310]
Uh-oh.

[02:02:39.070 --> 02:02:39.610]
Here's Miami.

[02:02:39.770 --> 02:02:39.970]
Hello?

[02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:41.450]
Hey, Neil.

[02:02:41.670 --> 02:02:42.010]
Yes, sir.

[02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:43.950]
We got screwed again.

[02:02:43.950 --> 02:02:46.030]
Alex Venus and company last Friday,

[02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:47.870]
before they recessed for the summer,

[02:02:48.590 --> 02:02:54.070]
voted a $11.74 set homeowner tax on every $1,000.

[02:02:54.330 --> 02:02:56.430]
You spend each year with the county.

[02:02:57.450 --> 02:03:00.210]
In other words, if you were paying two or $3,000 in Texas

[02:03:00.210 --> 02:03:03.530]
for every $1,000, it went up $11,74.

[02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:05.650]
There was a little particle in the Miami Herald

[02:03:05.650 --> 02:03:06.390]
and Saturday morning.

[02:03:06.610 --> 02:03:07.750]
Yeah, and what are they going to do with that?

[02:03:08.070 --> 02:03:10.290]
Well, that was imposed because they didn't get the sales tax

[02:03:10.290 --> 02:03:11.250]
when you were on Thursday.

[02:03:11.670 --> 02:03:11.830]
No.

[02:03:12.190 --> 02:03:12.510]
Yes.

[02:03:13.150 --> 02:03:14.210]
Well, what do you mean, yes?

[02:03:14.490 --> 02:03:15.850]
That's what they said in the article.

[02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:17.430]
What are you talking about?

[02:03:17.590 --> 02:03:18.990]
That plan is history.

[02:03:19.290 --> 02:03:19.630]
It's dead.

[02:03:19.730 --> 02:03:21.050]
They're not building any metro rail.

[02:03:21.490 --> 02:03:23.390]
No, but they got more money just for the money.

[02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:24.730]
And what are they going to do with it, sir?

[02:03:24.750 --> 02:03:26.170]
They're just going to spend it just like they were.

[02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:26.610]
OK, great.

[02:03:27.230 --> 02:03:28.230]
Another rocket scientist.

[02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:32.110]
Where do these people come from?

[02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:34.430]
Man, you talk about the stuff coming in over the weekend.

[02:03:34.650 --> 02:03:34.910]
Wow.

[02:03:36.330 --> 02:03:38.570]
They must have brought it in here by the truckload.

[02:03:38.730 --> 02:03:39.350]
Yeah, man.

[02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:43.810]
5,670560, 0560 on the mobile one line.

[02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:46.490]
Here's a call in West Voke.

[02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.790]

[02:03:47.290 --> 02:03:47.810]
Hey, Neil.

[02:03:48.030 --> 02:03:48.350]
Yes, sir.

[02:03:48.570 --> 02:03:51.530]
There are a couple of calls going.

[02:03:52.190 --> 02:03:53.190]
Just keep wordy on them.

[02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:56.070]
You start out so good, but it's also a point.

[02:03:56.970 --> 02:03:57.730]
It was just darned.

[02:03:57.850 --> 02:03:58.050]
Yeah.

[02:03:58.290 --> 02:03:59.110]
And 60 minutes.

[02:03:59.550 --> 02:04:01.230]
I don't know if you have 15 minutes.

[02:04:01.610 --> 02:04:02.270]
And 60 minutes.

[02:04:02.530 --> 02:04:02.730]
Yeah.

[02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:03.830]
I don't know if you recommend.

[02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:08.410]
They did a deal and pay a net.

[02:04:08.930 --> 02:04:10.710]
I just got you talking about that.

[02:04:10.710 --> 02:04:11.170]
No, no.

[02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:11.450]
You know, you go.

[02:04:11.770 --> 02:04:14.070]
And luckily, Saul started out at a gun show right here

[02:04:14.070 --> 02:04:14.510]
in Miami.

[02:04:14.910 --> 02:04:15.810]
You didn't mention the part.

[02:04:16.070 --> 02:04:17.350]
I don't know if you caught that.

[02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:21.350]
What they did, they banned a bayonet off the rifle.

[02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:23.230]
Off those, uh, on the bayonets.

[02:04:23.250 --> 02:04:24.130]
That's what I just said.

[02:04:24.630 --> 02:04:25.190]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[02:04:25.330 --> 02:04:26.170]
No, I didn't catch that part.

[02:04:26.910 --> 02:04:27.890]
I couldn't believe it.

[02:04:27.930 --> 02:04:29.550]
They actually banned a bayonet.

[02:04:29.810 --> 02:04:32.750]
Like, we're going to walk up to you with a semi-automatic

[02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:35.530]
and threaten you with a bayonet at the end of it.

[02:04:35.530 --> 02:04:38.510]
You know, like that's the most, uh, dangerous part of the rifle.

[02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:39.350]
Who's going to do it?

[02:04:39.370 --> 02:04:40.010]
Way to go.

[02:04:40.890 --> 02:04:41.390]
Way to go.

[02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:41.930]
Way to go.

[02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.390]

[02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:46.070]
Way to go.

[02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:47.630]
You don't start buying those damn cars.

[02:04:49.210 --> 02:04:50.510]
5, 6, 7, 8, wait.

[02:04:50.610 --> 02:04:51.990]
I've got to do something to get that damn stock.

[02:04:52.170 --> 02:04:54.650]
I'll be keep firing people, new president, new vice president.

[02:04:54.890 --> 02:04:55.470]
All kind of stuff.

[02:04:55.590 --> 02:04:57.310]
The stock is still in the toilet.

[02:04:58.770 --> 02:05:00.930]
And you know what happens when people start losing money

[02:05:00.930 --> 02:05:01.370]
and stock.

[02:05:02.690 --> 02:05:05.610]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60 and without the bayonet.

[02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:07.390]
And pound 5, 60 on a mobile one line.

[02:05:10.130 --> 02:05:11.410]
Here's a mobile invoke.

[02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:11.690]
Hello.

[02:05:12.570 --> 02:05:13.030]
I know.

[02:05:13.210 --> 02:05:14.550]
I was just calling about your callers.

[02:05:14.590 --> 02:05:15.410]
Are we allowed to do that?

[02:05:16.170 --> 02:05:17.090]
I'm allowed to do one.

[02:05:17.830 --> 02:05:19.050]
Talk about your callers.

[02:05:19.130 --> 02:05:19.430]
Of course.

[02:05:19.570 --> 02:05:19.710]
Of course.

[02:05:20.150 --> 02:05:20.590]
Why not?

[02:05:20.830 --> 02:05:23.790]
I've never seen an audience full of more jackass

[02:05:23.790 --> 02:05:24.770]
than my entire life.

[02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:25.230]
I agree.

[02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:28.570]
I mean, man, you know, there's something almost every Monday of my life.

[02:05:28.570 --> 02:05:29.370]
It's the same way.

[02:05:29.370 --> 02:05:33.470]
The only people I hear from on Monday are retards, like all of these 90% of what we've

[02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.970]
had here today.

[02:05:34.210 --> 02:05:35.950]
The worst cause in the history of the human race.

[02:05:36.150 --> 02:05:36.450]
That's right.

[02:05:36.630 --> 02:05:40.450]
I don't want to hear another sales tax call.

[02:05:40.710 --> 02:05:41.250]
I don't want to hear anything.

[02:05:41.250 --> 02:05:41.470]
Right.

[02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:43.030]
It's the one that I say before.

[02:05:43.150 --> 02:05:43.790]
It's over with.

[02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:44.530]
It's ancient history.

[02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:45.310]
We won.

[02:05:45.450 --> 02:05:46.050]
It was great.

[02:05:46.290 --> 02:05:47.190]
We put a stop to it.

[02:05:47.330 --> 02:05:48.250]
Now let's move on.

[02:05:48.330 --> 02:05:51.150]
I bring a 550 other goddamn things I'm talking about.

[02:05:51.330 --> 02:05:52.370]
And it's like I never said them.

[02:05:52.530 --> 02:05:55.630]
And then like two hours later, oh, by the way, you'll just see that thing on 60 minutes

[02:05:55.630 --> 02:05:57.050]
about the God, the salt weapons.

[02:05:57.050 --> 02:05:59.770]
I just got to talking about it and had no response.

[02:05:59.970 --> 02:06:00.890]
It's from Bokka.

[02:06:01.110 --> 02:06:01.810]
It's from Earth.

[02:06:01.970 --> 02:06:03.370]
Earth to anybody in Bokka.

[02:06:03.490 --> 02:06:04.730]
Earth to anybody in Bokka.

[02:06:05.550 --> 02:06:07.130]
Any of you want to inform me?

[02:06:07.650 --> 02:06:07.650]

[02:06:08.570 --> 02:06:10.570]
Have you heard that new mega radio station?

[02:06:11.450 --> 02:06:11.750]
No.

[02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.770]
I think it did.

[02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:14.450]
It's a disco station.

[02:06:14.930 --> 02:06:18.410]
I want to be the great she that I'm going to listen to what I'm going to wait home today

[02:06:18.410 --> 02:06:19.970]
in between Hang's commercial breaks.

[02:06:20.590 --> 02:06:22.570]
You better listen to it during Hang's show.

[02:06:22.710 --> 02:06:23.690]
Is somebody telling him for them?

[02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:25.190]
No.

[02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:26.510]
Oh, okay.

[02:06:28.270 --> 02:06:29.330]
Oh, now they're knocking.

[02:06:29.470 --> 02:06:31.410]
Hey, stupid Jesus Christ.

[02:06:31.670 --> 02:06:33.070]
What is wrong with you people today?

[02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:35.890]
Like I said, the good stuff came in over the weekend.

[02:06:36.050 --> 02:06:37.410]
The only problem is they didn't get any of it.

[02:06:37.490 --> 02:06:38.190]
That was the problem.

[02:06:38.530 --> 02:06:40.870]
And they're pissed off and fired up about it.

[02:06:41.890 --> 02:06:42.570]
George did.

[02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:46.310]
Yeah, he's in a good mood today for a change.

[02:06:46.430 --> 02:06:47.110]
He's feeling great.

[02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:52.530]
I'm not feeling all that great, but I'm still in a good mood because I got the hell out of that jungle I was in.

[02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:53.670]
Oh, man.

[02:06:55.190 --> 02:06:55.990]
Oh, God.

[02:06:56.530 --> 02:06:58.730]
And you noticed I haven't had any calls about that?

[02:06:59.950 --> 02:07:01.430]
Not one call about that.

[02:07:01.590 --> 02:07:03.970]
For many of my dark, complex friends in this audience, okay?

[02:07:04.390 --> 02:07:05.550]
And I'm not blaming you for it.

[02:07:05.690 --> 02:07:07.030]
But what kind of behavior is that?

[02:07:07.810 --> 02:07:11.690]
What kind of rude and loud obnoxious fartsus that we have up there in for the...

[02:07:11.690 --> 02:07:13.470]
That carabana thing in Toronto this weekend?

[02:07:14.930 --> 02:07:17.670]
I mean, the elevators are already overrun in the hotel as it is.

[02:07:17.670 --> 02:07:18.970]
It's so jam-packed with people.

[02:07:19.210 --> 02:07:21.090]
And every time you finally make it up on our two floors,

[02:07:21.410 --> 02:07:23.650]
and the door would open here be another whole bunch of fartsus.

[02:07:23.650 --> 02:07:25.950]
And they would hold it there open and start talking to each other.

[02:07:26.230 --> 02:07:29.290]
And high five and low five and then screaming and yelling and carrying on.

[02:07:29.670 --> 02:07:32.730]
And the other three or four of us, any elevators are going,

[02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:33.550]
come on already.

[02:07:33.710 --> 02:07:35.250]
Like, let's go, but we weren't saying it too loud.

[02:07:37.390 --> 02:07:38.070]
You know what I mean?

[02:07:38.290 --> 02:07:39.110]
Not saying it too loud.

[02:07:40.670 --> 02:07:41.030]
God.

[02:07:42.410 --> 02:07:47.170]
You know, I wish I had on tape the conversation that the cab driver and I had on my cab ride yesterday morning

[02:07:47.170 --> 02:07:48.470]
to Pearson International Airport.

[02:07:48.890 --> 02:07:49.250]
Wow.

[02:07:50.710 --> 02:07:55.230]
We'd have the NAACP, Jesse Jackson would be down here, but you know something too bad.

[02:07:56.630 --> 02:07:59.190]
That kind of behavior was unfri-kin-acceptable.

[02:07:59.630 --> 02:08:00.730]
And these weren't sluppers either.

[02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:03.610]
These were well-dressed people, people who aren't missing any meals.

[02:08:03.850 --> 02:08:06.070]
Some of them looked like ancho-mime and drag, bro.

[02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:07.110]
A chubby kind of people.

[02:08:07.890 --> 02:08:08.610]
Believe me.

[02:08:09.290 --> 02:08:10.730]
A little too much watermelon, I think,

[02:08:10.810 --> 02:08:12.110]
put some of these people right over the top.

[02:08:12.710 --> 02:08:17.130]
But out of control, out of fricking control, and 4.30 in the lobby yesterday morning,

[02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:18.370]
I go down to get my cab.

[02:08:18.370 --> 02:08:20.290]
And then jammin'.

[02:08:20.290 --> 02:08:22.550]
It's jammin', baby, 4.30 in the AM.

[02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:26.710]
And I'm thinking to myself, what are these people doing here?

[02:08:26.810 --> 02:08:27.610]
Are they just coming in?

[02:08:27.710 --> 02:08:28.530]
Are they just going out?

[02:08:28.770 --> 02:08:29.550]
Are they undecided?

[02:08:29.950 --> 02:08:30.870]
What are they doing here?

[02:08:33.890 --> 02:08:34.930]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[02:08:35.050 --> 02:08:35.230]
Hello.

[02:08:36.130 --> 02:08:36.690]
Hi, Neil.

[02:08:36.970 --> 02:08:37.430]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:08:37.550 --> 02:08:38.790]
I just have a quick comment.

[02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:40.530]
Golf sucks.

[02:08:40.970 --> 02:08:41.170]
Yeah.

[02:08:41.550 --> 02:08:43.070]
And the only thing worse.

[02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:45.590]
But you got three hours of it in prime time on ABC tonight.

[02:08:45.670 --> 02:08:46.790]
Well, that's what I was thinking.

[02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:48.790]
Hey, golf on ABC hiding prime time.

[02:08:48.810 --> 02:08:51.110]
Yes, and golf is golf on prime time.

[02:08:51.210 --> 02:08:51.330]
Right.

[02:08:51.650 --> 02:08:52.130]
It blows.

[02:08:52.350 --> 02:08:52.530]
Right.

[02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:53.330]
I was a day.

[02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:54.010]
And back to you.

[02:08:54.130 --> 02:08:56.350]
There is a lady who's not going to put up with it anymore, okay?

[02:08:56.430 --> 02:08:57.690]
You and your damned golf balls.

[02:08:59.190 --> 02:09:02.950]
Then this is how desperate America is come to come for entertainment now.

[02:09:04.050 --> 02:09:05.410]
They watched a few snuff films,

[02:09:05.530 --> 02:09:07.050]
spaces of death parts once you're 100.

[02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:08.250]
They got burned out on that.

[02:09:09.170 --> 02:09:11.450]
They watched all the goddamn JFK Jr.

[02:09:11.730 --> 02:09:13.390]
John John crap for about 2.5 weeks.

[02:09:13.630 --> 02:09:15.130]
They finally got burned out on that.

[02:09:15.930 --> 02:09:17.450]
The guy that killed everybody off in Atlanta.

[02:09:17.450 --> 02:09:19.090]
They watched that for about 4 or 5 hours.

[02:09:19.190 --> 02:09:20.170]
Then they got burned out on that.

[02:09:20.230 --> 02:09:20.770]
Well, big deal.

[02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:22.030]
You know, happens all the time.

[02:09:22.750 --> 02:09:26.230]
So now we have to, we replaced all of this with golf in prime time.

[02:09:26.370 --> 02:09:26.610]
Ow!

[02:09:30.130 --> 02:09:31.850]
Now, I don't want to say I don't like Tyker Woods

[02:09:31.850 --> 02:09:33.410]
because that would make me sound like I'm a racist

[02:09:33.410 --> 02:09:34.810]
because I have the Winchester from Golf to be going.

[02:09:34.950 --> 02:09:36.290]
I don't even know who this other guy is.

[02:09:36.710 --> 02:09:37.550]
What's his name, Dale?

[02:09:38.450 --> 02:09:39.190]
What is his name?

[02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:41.730]
The other golfer that he's up against tonight.

[02:09:43.470 --> 02:09:43.890]
Let's see.

[02:09:43.890 --> 02:09:47.770]
Dave Duval, do you want to know why I know it's a word association thing?

[02:09:48.090 --> 02:09:50.790]
Because he has the same name as the weather guy on CFTO in Toronto.

[02:09:51.490 --> 02:09:51.990]
Dave Duval.

[02:09:52.290 --> 02:09:53.510]
That's why I know that's what his name is.

[02:09:53.630 --> 02:09:54.190]
Nice going, Neil.

[02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.630]
Thank you.

[02:09:55.830 --> 02:09:58.190]
I hope Dave Duval beats him by like 15 strokes.

[02:09:58.510 --> 02:10:00.390]
In fact, I hope that Tyker has a stroke, okay?

[02:10:00.650 --> 02:10:01.690]
Not just because he's dark.

[02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:04.870]
Not just because he's, what's his other thing?

[02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.730]
Asian.

[02:10:05.890 --> 02:10:06.310]
Oh, I know.

[02:10:06.450 --> 02:10:06.910]
But what is he?

[02:10:06.970 --> 02:10:08.870]
He's a Taiwanese.

[02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:10.030]
Tywin on?

[02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:11.810]
He's a tycoon.

[02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:14.150]
That's what it was.

[02:10:14.810 --> 02:10:16.650]
Not because of that, because I'm sick of him.

[02:10:17.130 --> 02:10:21.410]
Who the hell is he making 20 and 30 million dollars because he can hit a God damn golf ball?

[02:10:21.630 --> 02:10:22.890]
We're talking crazy people.

[02:10:23.610 --> 02:10:25.090]
God am I impressed or what?

[02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.350]

[02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:30.330]
Oh, that was you, baby.

[02:10:30.910 --> 02:10:31.930]
I'm still in heaven.

[02:10:32.450 --> 02:10:32.450]

[02:10:32.450 --> 02:10:33.230]
I'm still in heaven.

[02:10:33.230 --> 02:10:33.230]

[02:10:33.910 --> 02:10:35.310]
I'm still in heaven.

[02:10:35.310 --> 02:10:35.730]
I'm still in heaven.

[02:10:35.730 --> 02:10:35.830]
I'm still in heaven.

[02:10:37.890 --> 02:10:41.130]
I'm still in heaven.

[02:10:42.130 --> 02:10:47.710]
More I've been to Peter Sisto, rock, wood, and sour crap.

[02:10:48.290 --> 02:10:51.230]
I love a Polish piscose.

[02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:53.810]
I'll roll to barrel out.

[02:10:54.230 --> 02:10:58.750]
I put off the leader's hoaxes and I will ever find a hat.

[02:10:59.170 --> 02:10:59.370]
Yes.

[02:11:00.170 --> 02:11:05.110]
The sound of a crack through my hands and I'll still flare a tear.

[02:11:06.110 --> 02:11:11.450]
It's the sound of the waltz, and it's my favorite.

[02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:14.430]
That's the sound of a lively polka.

[02:11:14.770 --> 02:11:15.250]
All right.

[02:11:15.870 --> 02:11:18.090]
Peter's gone, Peter's died enough.

[02:11:18.690 --> 02:11:20.370]
Peter's alive, Peter's gone.

[02:11:21.230 --> 02:11:23.070]
The camp is broke.

[02:11:23.450 --> 02:11:26.530]
I could have just passed the trauma of polka.

[02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:29.650]
Peter's gone, Peter's gone.

[02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:32.290]
Peter's alive, Peter's gone.

[02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:35.470]
Peter's alive, Peter's gone.

[02:11:35.950 --> 02:11:38.590]
I'm staying up on the camp, polka.

[02:11:39.450 --> 02:11:44.630]
The band goes on top and we'll finish up the polka.

[02:11:45.650 --> 02:11:48.150]
Dance with your grandma.

[02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:50.690]
During a lovely polka,

[02:11:51.530 --> 02:11:53.230]
this house of men.

[02:11:53.570 --> 02:11:56.710]
Don't fear, don't drink the fondue, polka.

[02:11:57.590 --> 02:12:00.230]
It's all good outside.

[02:12:00.670 --> 02:12:02.650]
This is a two-up polka!

[02:12:03.630 --> 02:12:05.730]
This is a two-up polka!

[02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:06.290]
Come on!

[02:12:07.110 --> 02:12:07.690]
Everyone's out!

[02:12:07.870 --> 02:12:08.630]
Stop polka!

[02:12:09.170 --> 02:12:09.810]
He's home!

[02:12:10.850 --> 02:12:11.910]
That's not every night!

[02:12:12.750 --> 02:12:14.430]
There she goes, he likes that polka.

[02:12:15.150 --> 02:12:17.070]
Well, three and five, 60 WMQ.

[02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:18.970]
Here's that facts from Chris who refacted.

[02:12:19.070 --> 02:12:20.550]
I thank you because it's a great fact that says,

[02:12:20.610 --> 02:12:22.110]
I want to agree with you on the fraternity issue.

[02:12:22.770 --> 02:12:25.650]
There's absolutely no reason for fraternities or sororities.

[02:12:25.950 --> 02:12:27.870]
I attended the University of Miami several years ago

[02:12:27.870 --> 02:12:29.970]
and one of the first days on campus

[02:12:29.970 --> 02:12:31.790]
in a bathroom stall was written.

[02:12:32.190 --> 02:12:35.130]
Fract guys are high school nerds who have to pay for their friends.

[02:12:36.550 --> 02:12:37.810]
That's absolutely correct.

[02:12:38.050 --> 02:12:39.670]
Absolutely correct sir!

[02:12:39.810 --> 02:12:41.890]
They collected dues of $700 per year

[02:12:41.890 --> 02:12:43.750]
just for the privilege of being able to wear their shirt

[02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:44.950]
and give secret handshakes.

[02:12:45.170 --> 02:12:48.710]
There are 12-year-old boys with more maturity than what goes on in these fraternities.

[02:12:49.050 --> 02:12:51.010]
And you know what that hating stuff is?

[02:12:51.290 --> 02:12:52.830]
It's a gay club you more on since Chris.

[02:12:54.190 --> 02:12:56.090]
Also, they like to talk about themselves as brothers

[02:12:56.090 --> 02:12:59.550]
but I saw so many guys screw each other over for women.

[02:12:59.630 --> 02:13:00.130]
It was ridiculous.

[02:13:01.410 --> 02:13:03.130]
And you have to be careful how you read that sentence.

[02:13:03.490 --> 02:13:05.250]
I saw so many guys screw each other over for women.

[02:13:05.310 --> 02:13:05.830]
It was ridiculous.

[02:13:06.190 --> 02:13:08.090]
Hazing with extensive amounts of alcohol,

[02:13:08.290 --> 02:13:10.290]
ought to bring a jail sentence for those f-ing-frared boys.

[02:13:10.630 --> 02:13:12.650]
If universities had any balls, they'd outlaw them.

[02:13:12.830 --> 02:13:13.230]
Right!

[02:13:14.230 --> 02:13:16.430]
But that's another one of the stupid American myths

[02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:20.110]
that if you're supposed to go to college and experience the Greek life.

[02:13:20.250 --> 02:13:21.690]
You know what that Greek means, don't you?

[02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:21.890]
No.

[02:13:22.190 --> 02:13:24.090]
It wasted all the time and act like a moron.

[02:13:24.090 --> 02:13:26.170]
Of course I could drag and party these and them out there.

[02:13:26.490 --> 02:13:28.450]
But fraternities and sororities have nothing to do with learning.

[02:13:28.630 --> 02:13:30.290]
Which is what you're supposed to be doing there says,

[02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:31.330]
Chris, okay?

[02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:34.650]
And if you can't get late and have a few beers in college,

[02:13:34.870 --> 02:13:36.470]
without you having an opportunity or sorority,

[02:13:36.690 --> 02:13:37.170]
then you're a loser.

[02:13:37.170 --> 02:13:39.430]
Anyway, go back to grade school and start over again.

[02:13:41.410 --> 02:13:43.050]
That thing at MIT last night.

[02:13:43.190 --> 02:13:45.090]
That was just enough to tear your guts out.

[02:13:45.670 --> 02:13:46.670]
Make you nauseous.

[02:13:47.210 --> 02:13:49.230]
Parents send their kid away to school five weeks later.

[02:13:49.370 --> 02:13:49.690]
Guess what?

[02:13:49.890 --> 02:13:50.350]
He's dead.

[02:13:52.030 --> 02:13:53.810]
No, it was just puking his guts out.

[02:13:53.930 --> 02:13:56.470]
We put him on the bed down in the basement, left him alone a while,

[02:13:56.570 --> 02:13:57.830]
so we can go back and drink some more.

[02:13:59.290 --> 02:14:01.230]
And when he went back downstairs, he was purple.

[02:14:02.230 --> 02:14:03.410]
Purple, not red.

[02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:04.250]
Purple.

[02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:07.930]
Here's the Hollywood, hello.

[02:14:08.630 --> 02:14:11.090]
Yeah, I don't know if you've seen the article on 3A of the Sun,

[02:14:11.130 --> 02:14:12.850]
but today, Christian Coralition.

[02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:15.410]
Oh, yes, Christian Coralition, hobbled by turmoil.

[02:14:15.830 --> 02:14:16.750]
Yes, the...

[02:14:16.750 --> 02:14:18.710]
That is the part who's exact heavy tool.

[02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:19.750]
I have it in my hand right now.

[02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:23.250]
The high point of it is here is it says that cutting him,

[02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:26.450]
who resigned in March of the Coalition's director of national operations,

[02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:30.210]
is now Capitol Hill lobbyist for the National Rifle Association.

[02:14:30.330 --> 02:14:30.950]
How do you like that?

[02:14:31.290 --> 02:14:31.930]
That's the coincidence.

[02:14:32.850 --> 02:14:35.670]
It's a very interesting article, but I thought that was the high point.

[02:14:35.850 --> 02:14:36.690]
Yeah, what does that tell you?

[02:14:36.850 --> 02:14:37.830]
Yeah, that's all my material.

[02:14:37.950 --> 02:14:39.030]
That's a lot to do with religion, man.

[02:14:39.250 --> 02:14:39.610]
Absolutely.

[02:14:39.890 --> 02:14:40.730]
Okay, and God bless you.

[02:14:40.830 --> 02:14:41.010]
All right.

[02:14:41.670 --> 02:14:42.310]
There you go.

[02:14:42.590 --> 02:14:44.930]
Christian Coralition, I have some serious problems, man,

[02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:45.730]
because, well,

[02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:49.670]
I just kind of fallen apart of the scene, especially since the IRS

[02:14:49.670 --> 02:14:51.310]
said, give us your guide, Dan Money, okay?

[02:14:51.530 --> 02:14:52.450]
And okay, okay.

[02:14:53.590 --> 02:14:57.370]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T line.

[02:14:57.490 --> 02:14:59.190]
They can have 50 million shows on, like,

[02:14:59.230 --> 02:15:01.570]
they did down 60 minutes last night on the gun shows,

[02:15:01.730 --> 02:15:04.850]
and they can have Leslie Stahl on there and Diane Feinstein

[02:15:04.850 --> 02:15:07.030]
and Pat Rosio Donald and everybody else.

[02:15:07.150 --> 02:15:08.610]
And it's not going to do a frickin' bit of good,

[02:15:08.830 --> 02:15:11.650]
because the NRA and the gun nuts run this country,

[02:15:11.950 --> 02:15:14.810]
which is why every day people are getting blown away in this country,

[02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:16.730]
but they're going to have to drive this crazy house.

[02:15:18.250 --> 02:15:20.170]
And those people are got the politicians,

[02:15:20.170 --> 02:15:23.390]
especially the Republicans, but not exclusively, in their pocket.

[02:15:23.810 --> 02:15:26.530]
Just like Don Coralion had the judge in his pocket,

[02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:28.510]
they got all the politicians in their pocket.

[02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:31.350]
So if you really believe that in our lifetime,

[02:15:31.630 --> 02:15:33.410]
any significant change is going to happen with a

[02:15:33.410 --> 02:15:34.990]
front nut shot there, you're dreaming.

[02:15:37.450 --> 02:15:38.490]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[02:15:38.490 --> 02:15:38.870]
Hello.

[02:15:39.730 --> 02:15:40.070]
Yes, sir.

[02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:41.550]
How about we just name Monday,

[02:15:41.550 --> 02:15:42.810]
more on Monday?

[02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:44.830]
Yeah, it sounds perfect for today.

[02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:46.870]
I'd like to comment on that tree again,

[02:15:47.150 --> 02:15:48.930]
asshole about six months ago about a day.

[02:15:48.930 --> 02:15:49.470]
Which one?

[02:15:50.010 --> 02:15:53.630]
The three hugger that Braimins...

[02:15:53.630 --> 02:15:53.970]
Oh, yeah.

[02:15:54.430 --> 02:15:58.110]
How about the millions and millions of workers in the auto industry

[02:15:58.110 --> 02:16:01.830]
that are going to suffer if they stop making cars?

[02:16:02.610 --> 02:16:02.790]
Yeah.

[02:16:03.190 --> 02:16:04.390]
I mean, he doesn't think about that.

[02:16:04.690 --> 02:16:06.850]
It's a typical tree hugging asshole.

[02:16:07.690 --> 02:16:08.310]
That's what I got to say.

[02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:09.410]
Okay, Tom to hug this.

[02:16:10.590 --> 02:16:13.130]
Hey, they have alternatives that they have had for years

[02:16:13.130 --> 02:16:14.910]
to what we got today, but you know,

[02:16:14.970 --> 02:16:16.750]
there's too much money in the whole world is about money,

[02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:17.390]
so forget it.

[02:16:17.590 --> 02:16:19.410]
And that's why when you look outside some days,

[02:16:19.610 --> 02:16:21.170]
and you can't see like two feet ahead of you,

[02:16:21.250 --> 02:16:23.430]
and it's not fog or maybe it's smog,

[02:16:23.670 --> 02:16:25.810]
like in Los Angeles for the last 30 years.

[02:16:27.710 --> 02:16:30.410]
Last time I was in LA, and I'm on the freeway,

[02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:33.330]
and I'm looking ahead, there's a Hollywood hillside

[02:16:33.330 --> 02:16:34.450]
who's up there in the mountain somewhere,

[02:16:34.650 --> 02:16:35.510]
but you can't see it.

[02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:36.470]
You can't see it.

[02:16:36.530 --> 02:16:37.230]
You know it's up there.

[02:16:37.230 --> 02:16:38.750]
You cannot see it.

[02:16:40.210 --> 02:16:41.290]
And I'm thinking to myself,

[02:16:41.530 --> 02:16:42.770]
I would roll down the window here,

[02:16:42.850 --> 02:16:43.770]
but I would probably die.

[02:16:44.130 --> 02:16:45.230]
You know, I mean, you can't breathe,

[02:16:46.190 --> 02:16:47.690]
but don't confuse us with the facts,

[02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:49.470]
because somebody's making a lot of money from it,

[02:16:49.530 --> 02:16:51.690]
so we can't interfere with that.

[02:16:53.710 --> 02:16:54.510]
Let me say it again.

[02:16:54.670 --> 02:16:55.410]
Legalize the wicked.

[02:16:55.410 --> 02:16:56.810]
We take that tax money.

[02:16:56.910 --> 02:16:58.150]
You build all the highways you want,

[02:16:58.250 --> 02:16:59.910]
all the buses, all the, whatever it is,

[02:16:59.910 --> 02:17:02.790]
all the metro rail, whatever you like.

[02:17:04.110 --> 02:17:06.510]
And let all those goddamn bastards out of jail,

[02:17:06.510 --> 02:17:08.730]
literally, oh, you got four plants in your backyard.

[02:17:09.010 --> 02:17:09.650]
That's 10 years.

[02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:12.870]
And I love these stories that we're seeing now

[02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:14.730]
that we have all these horrible mass murders going on.

[02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:16.890]
These stories we're finding out about people who went to jail

[02:17:16.890 --> 02:17:17.710]
before from murders,

[02:17:18.030 --> 02:17:19.690]
and got out for, in like, six, seven, eight years.

[02:17:21.230 --> 02:17:23.990]
You grow ten, we tend to plant in your backyard.

[02:17:24.330 --> 02:17:27.250]
You're going to get 10 years, minimum mandatory sentence.

[02:17:27.690 --> 02:17:28.970]
But if you go out and kill somebody,

[02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:30.190]
you get six or seven or eight years.

[02:17:31.730 --> 02:17:34.290]
That's your federal government for your hearted work.

[02:17:36.450 --> 02:17:37.250]
Here's Bokeh, hello.

[02:17:37.670 --> 02:17:37.930]
Neil.

[02:17:38.190 --> 02:17:38.530]
Yes, sir.

[02:17:38.670 --> 02:17:41.170]
Hey, sir, this day has dropped with all the callers

[02:17:41.170 --> 02:17:41.990]
that have been calling, huh?

[02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.190]
Yeah.

[02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:46.810]
No, I have to agree that you 100% are the fraternities,

[02:17:46.890 --> 02:17:49.410]
because when I was in college, I was in a fraternity,

[02:17:49.490 --> 02:17:51.490]
and when I was there, I thought it was the coolest thing in the world.

[02:17:51.730 --> 02:17:54.310]
And now, if not a little older, more mature,

[02:17:54.470 --> 02:17:56.550]
I mean, yeah, there was the waste of time,

[02:17:56.770 --> 02:17:57.530]
and it was just stupid.

[02:17:59.290 --> 02:18:01.330]
I was watching CNN today, by the way,

[02:18:01.330 --> 02:18:06.470]
and there was a headlamp in that Ted Kennedy jumped the award

[02:18:06.470 --> 02:18:08.070]
because he thought John's on had his watch.

[02:18:08.550 --> 02:18:08.570]
Yeah.

[02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:09.550]
Yeah.

[02:18:09.930 --> 02:18:11.130]
All right, I want to let you know.

[02:18:11.630 --> 02:18:11.670]
Bye.

[02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:16.830]
56670560, who bad about these bad callers, right?

[02:18:17.470 --> 02:18:18.150]
That's what he said.

[02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:24.530]
Count 560 on the AT&T wireless line nine minutes after you're 1 at 560WQM,

[02:18:24.530 --> 02:18:26.070]
the hangover show from Shulah's at 2.

[02:18:26.290 --> 02:18:29.390]
We got Jim Mandin at 6 o'clock Ed Kaplan for you degenerates,

[02:18:29.390 --> 02:18:31.710]
for your real losers in life, 10 o'clock tonight.

[02:18:32.490 --> 02:18:34.990]
You blow too much, you're in trouble.

[02:18:35.130 --> 02:18:42.390]
So can it be our woman need a friend?

[02:18:43.710 --> 02:18:43.970]
Oh!

[02:18:44.350 --> 02:18:46.930]
5.10.

[02:18:48.490 --> 02:18:52.310]
We'll mock you on your ass.

[02:18:52.750 --> 02:18:53.230]
Oh, grat.

[02:18:53.230 --> 02:18:57.890]
Hey, you're a guy, so you buy our sides,

[02:18:58.110 --> 02:19:01.490]
you're a king, you're the king.

[02:19:03.230 --> 02:19:08.910]
So he's a guy, so you're a king, you're the king.

[02:19:09.650 --> 02:19:09.850]
Oh!

[02:19:10.050 --> 02:19:13.230]
3.10.

[02:19:13.230 --> 02:19:23.230]
4.10.

[02:19:24.570 --> 02:19:25.870]
4.10.

[02:19:31.230 --> 02:19:31.490]
Okay.

[02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:45.430]
1.15 at 560WQM,

[02:19:45.470 --> 02:19:47.010]
tomorrow we're starting a six-part series.

[02:19:47.170 --> 02:19:49.190]
What are we going to do about the Schwarches North of the border?

[02:19:49.350 --> 02:19:51.250]
That starts tomorrow at 11 o'clock here on the show.

[02:19:52.090 --> 02:19:52.970]
What are you laughing about?

[02:19:53.070 --> 02:19:54.110]
This is a serious businessman.

[02:19:56.130 --> 02:19:57.570]
Here's a, what does that say?

[02:19:58.010 --> 02:19:59.050]
Oh, a birthday in Miami.

[02:19:59.210 --> 02:19:59.370]
Hello.

[02:19:59.370 --> 02:20:00.810]
Hello, Neil.

[02:20:01.110 --> 02:20:01.370]
Yes.

[02:20:01.830 --> 02:20:02.170]
Neil.

[02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:06.870]
As far as the spring over Florida to kill the wiki weed,

[02:20:06.890 --> 02:20:09.010]
it is outrageous.

[02:20:09.810 --> 02:20:12.150]
I'm going to start a hunger strike right now.

[02:20:13.090 --> 02:20:15.150]
And you need to, I'm going to tell you about 2.15,

[02:20:15.270 --> 02:20:16.070]
I'm going on one, yeah.

[02:20:16.370 --> 02:20:17.630]
Well, you're going to support me too.

[02:20:17.650 --> 02:20:20.170]
I feel so fat right now, I feel fat or not, I have in years,

[02:20:20.170 --> 02:20:22.410]
I feel like I'm just overflowing with food.

[02:20:23.090 --> 02:20:23.350]
Neil.

[02:20:23.650 --> 02:20:25.870]
I feel like my kishkeys are about to spring right out of my

[02:20:26.350 --> 02:20:27.990]
thing out of my stomach, yes.

[02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.870]
Hello, Neil.

[02:20:31.830 --> 02:20:33.770]
I thought you put birthday on this, George.

[02:20:35.570 --> 02:20:35.750]
Yeah.

[02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.250]
Neil.

[02:20:36.690 --> 02:20:37.190]
Yeah, I'm listening.

[02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:38.810]
So, are we not going to be sure why?

[02:20:39.150 --> 02:20:40.590]
Are we going to smoke the wiki weed?

[02:20:41.710 --> 02:20:43.170]
Let's go to a lady in Miami.

[02:20:43.330 --> 02:20:43.490]
Hello.

[02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:46.910]
That's one of your boyfriends.

[02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.570]
Lady in Miami.

[02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:47.850]
Hello.

[02:20:49.390 --> 02:20:51.010]
Well, these buttons are sticky.

[02:20:51.010 --> 02:20:51.390]
Hello.

[02:20:51.730 --> 02:20:52.150]
Neil.

[02:20:52.390 --> 02:20:52.490]
Hello.

[02:20:53.210 --> 02:20:53.730]
How are you?

[02:20:54.030 --> 02:20:54.570]
I'm good.

[02:20:54.750 --> 02:20:54.990]
Listen.

[02:20:54.990 --> 02:20:56.030]
I have something.

[02:20:56.130 --> 02:20:57.090]
Don't help me off, please.

[02:20:57.290 --> 02:21:01.370]
Can I take a couple shots at the Miami Police in Bell South?

[02:21:03.210 --> 02:21:05.170]
Now, what kind of a way is that to start a conversation?

[02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:07.710]
I don't know because I've called you before and you hang up on me.

[02:21:07.850 --> 02:21:08.290]
Why is that?

[02:21:08.470 --> 02:21:09.050]
I don't know because I'm boring.

[02:21:09.050 --> 02:21:11.050]
If you had anything to say, I wouldn't, yeah.

[02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:12.870]
I'll just pour it out and have fun again.

[02:21:13.310 --> 02:21:14.230]
Don't make it boring.

[02:21:14.350 --> 02:21:15.670]
Make it something that might be interesting.

[02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:16.630]
This is interesting.

[02:21:17.310 --> 02:21:18.150]
This is interesting.

[02:21:18.410 --> 02:21:20.430]
I live in the neighborhood where you work.

[02:21:20.850 --> 02:21:23.990]
My employer's beautiful Mercedes was stolen on the last

[02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:25.650]
stop when they have the news.

[02:21:26.010 --> 02:21:29.530]
He called the Miami Police and they said, well, busy, can you call us back in an hour?

[02:21:29.730 --> 02:21:29.910]
Yeah.

[02:21:30.170 --> 02:21:34.870]
Okay, and I called Bell South and asked for your number and they gave me WIOD.

[02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.510]
Yeah.

[02:21:35.770 --> 02:21:36.170]
Hey.

[02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:38.190]
And?

[02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:41.410]
And I love you and I agree with everything you said today.

[02:21:41.730 --> 02:21:42.770]
I'm calling you.

[02:21:44.110 --> 02:21:44.510]
Okay.

[02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:45.930]
See you.

[02:21:46.170 --> 02:21:46.270]
Bye.

[02:21:47.230 --> 02:21:47.350]
Yeah.

[02:21:47.930 --> 02:21:49.550]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:21:50.110 --> 02:21:50.290]
Boy.

[02:21:51.390 --> 02:21:52.190]
I'm speechless.

[02:21:52.350 --> 02:21:52.770]
I really am.

[02:21:52.770 --> 02:21:53.350]
I'm going to show you today.

[02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:54.490]
Why did I come back?

[02:21:54.650 --> 02:21:55.810]
I was having such a great time.

[02:21:57.090 --> 02:21:58.210]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, and 5.

[02:21:58.310 --> 02:21:59.550]
And in fact, by now, maybe the smarts are gone.

[02:21:59.630 --> 02:22:00.230]
Let's give it a shot.

[02:22:00.350 --> 02:22:00.510]
Okay.

[02:22:00.610 --> 02:22:01.450]
What time can I call Helen?

[02:22:01.530 --> 02:22:02.350]
See if I can get on that plane.

[02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:06.830]
By the way, there was a Colombian team on the plane going up Friday night.

[02:22:07.150 --> 02:22:07.570]
And I don't know.

[02:22:07.950 --> 02:22:10.890]
It couldn't have been for the Pan American games because that didn't win a peg.

[02:22:11.730 --> 02:22:12.970]
Some kind of, and they were ugly.

[02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:13.770]
That's the worst part.

[02:22:14.010 --> 02:22:15.610]
A bunch of ugly Colombians.

[02:22:16.210 --> 02:22:17.070]
Now that's a rarity.

[02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:19.590]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:22:20.410 --> 02:22:22.390]
On the 18T line, here's Weston.

[02:22:22.470 --> 02:22:22.590]
Hello.

[02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:25.150]
Weston.

[02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.890]
Hello.

[02:22:26.310 --> 02:22:26.750]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:27.090 --> 02:22:27.870]
Neil, how are you?

[02:22:27.950 --> 02:22:28.190]
Okay.

[02:22:29.010 --> 02:22:30.150]
Mind if I change a subject?

[02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:31.510]
What subject?

[02:22:31.650 --> 02:22:32.710]
What kind of subject is there?

[02:22:32.830 --> 02:22:33.830]
Whatever you want to talk about.

[02:22:33.890 --> 02:22:35.590]
If it's more interesting than the last woman, you got a shot.

[02:22:35.810 --> 02:22:36.530]
This is a great story.

[02:22:36.930 --> 02:22:38.710]
There's a great story in a very true story.

[02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:42.070]
I've been dating this girl as a bartender on South Beach for a couple of weeks now.

[02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:46.690]
And she said to me, we're going to a birthday party for one of her friends who's a lesbian.

[02:22:46.690 --> 02:22:47.330]
It was great.

[02:22:47.490 --> 02:22:48.130]
I love lesbian.

[02:22:49.250 --> 02:22:50.230]
It was a lesbian party.

[02:22:50.550 --> 02:22:51.930]
And was it a birthday party?

[02:22:52.670 --> 02:22:53.450]
A psychic lesbian?

[02:22:53.890 --> 02:22:58.010]
No, actually, she tells me she's straight, but I think she could go by, but we're working on that.

[02:22:59.850 --> 02:23:04.530]
Throughout the party, having a good time, and I wanted to go get a drink in another room.

[02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:08.370]
And I dropped off my, I brought a sweater too because it was cold.

[02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:10.290]
So I wanted to have the room to get a sweater.

[02:23:10.650 --> 02:23:11.250]
It was cold.

[02:23:11.610 --> 02:23:14.230]
Yeah, the air conditioning is on too free.

[02:23:14.290 --> 02:23:14.730]
I don't know.

[02:23:14.730 --> 02:23:16.230]
Listen to the story.

[02:23:16.370 --> 02:23:17.370]
It's nothing to do with the story.

[02:23:18.290 --> 02:23:21.870]
I walked into this other bedroom and they're unbelievably.

[02:23:22.730 --> 02:23:26.810]
A life-size blow-up doll with a strap on it.

[02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:32.990]
But the thing was, I look up at the face and whose face is taped on there, cut out.

[02:23:33.810 --> 02:23:40.850]
None other than Neil God on the bill, on the blow-up doll with the strap on.

[02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:43.590]
Turns out she was a big-neil rod just for you.

[02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:46.690]
The one, the picture with you with the big Stogie coming out of your mouth.

[02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:48.490]
On to the doll.

[02:23:50.470 --> 02:23:51.270]
Wonderful story.

[02:23:51.790 --> 02:23:52.190]
Unbelievable.

[02:23:52.410 --> 02:23:52.590]
Yeah.

[02:23:52.830 --> 02:23:55.010]
I have a special request if it's okay with you.

[02:23:58.070 --> 02:24:00.730]
5670560, Pom 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:24:00.730 --> 02:24:01.710]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:24:01.710 --> 02:24:02.070]
Hello.

[02:24:02.530 --> 02:24:02.930]
Who?

[02:24:03.210 --> 02:24:03.530]
Yes, sir.

[02:24:03.930 --> 02:24:04.450]
Hey, Queen.

[02:24:05.190 --> 02:24:05.350]
Yeah.

[02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:06.670]
How's it going, Neil?

[02:24:06.990 --> 02:24:07.870]
What can I do for you, sir?

[02:24:07.970 --> 02:24:08.230]
Chronic.

[02:24:08.230 --> 02:24:10.290]
Hey, Neil.

[02:24:10.610 --> 02:24:11.390]
Here's North Lauderdale.

[02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.630]
Hello.

[02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:14.550]
North Lauderdale.

[02:24:15.010 --> 02:24:15.650]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:24:15.870 --> 02:24:16.170]
Yes, sir.

[02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:21.190]
I'd like to talk about a concert that went on two weeks ago and on here in AmpliPhera.

[02:24:22.330 --> 02:24:26.590]
We went there for the concert for 279 for the tickets.

[02:24:28.410 --> 02:24:29.990]
And no one showed up.

[02:24:30.190 --> 02:24:32.050]
So we got zip out of 279 for the tickets.

[02:24:32.050 --> 02:24:33.410]
No one showed up.

[02:24:33.550 --> 02:24:33.890]
No one.

[02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:34.470]
And the tenors.

[02:24:35.210 --> 02:24:36.290]
Showed up for the concert.

[02:24:36.290 --> 02:24:36.890]
Who was it?

[02:24:36.930 --> 02:24:38.010]
Who was supposed to be performing?

[02:24:38.510 --> 02:24:39.870]
A lot of it's Jamaican artists.

[02:24:40.490 --> 02:24:41.670]
A lot of Jamaican artists?

[02:24:41.810 --> 02:24:42.470]
Yes, I'm hard.

[02:24:42.690 --> 02:24:42.870]
Oh.

[02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:45.530]
So thousands of people had to get started.

[02:24:45.670 --> 02:24:47.270]
Twenty-seven dollars a piece for the ticket.

[02:24:47.570 --> 02:24:47.770]
Yeah.

[02:24:48.210 --> 02:24:52.230]
No police, report, earnestly, was fed about it.

[02:24:52.370 --> 02:24:53.950]
No city official came to buy it.

[02:24:54.110 --> 02:24:54.770]
That's a novelty.

[02:24:54.890 --> 02:24:55.950]
A Jamaican ripoff artist.

[02:24:56.130 --> 02:24:56.530]
That's unusual.

[02:24:57.510 --> 02:25:00.150]
So we got no help from the city official or anything.

[02:25:00.530 --> 02:25:00.650]
Right.

[02:25:01.010 --> 02:25:02.790]
You know, if I was a hooliol probably.

[02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:03.070]
Right.

[02:25:03.850 --> 02:25:06.370]
They'd have probably given you a new inflatable banana boat.

[02:25:06.470 --> 02:25:06.790]
That's right.

[02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:08.550]
All right, Neil.

[02:25:08.830 --> 02:25:08.950]
OK.

[02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:10.030]
Go do it again, Mon.

[02:25:11.450 --> 02:25:11.830]
567.

[02:25:12.130 --> 02:25:13.910]
I tell you, I'm so glad I came back here.

[02:25:14.050 --> 02:25:14.730]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:25:14.810 --> 02:25:15.750]
I'm really ecstatic.

[02:25:17.170 --> 02:25:17.930]
567.0560.

[02:25:18.390 --> 02:25:21.030]
Pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:22.550]
Here's Danya.

[02:25:22.730 --> 02:25:22.850]
Hello.

[02:25:23.350 --> 02:25:24.330]
Hey, how are you doing, Neil?

[02:25:24.470 --> 02:25:25.170]
Oh, fantastic.

[02:25:25.270 --> 02:25:25.910]
Can't you tell?

[02:25:26.390 --> 02:25:27.050]
I don't know.

[02:25:27.150 --> 02:25:28.730]
These are hard acts for me to follow.

[02:25:29.430 --> 02:25:32.010]
One, I had a glimmer of hope yesterday.

[02:25:32.010 --> 02:25:35.210]
I was on Danya Beach and I actually seen an entire family

[02:25:35.210 --> 02:25:39.570]
who felt free enough to be changing from their street clothes,

[02:25:39.770 --> 02:25:42.430]
that they were bathing suits right there in front of God and everybody.

[02:25:42.510 --> 02:25:42.890]
Oh, my God.

[02:25:43.270 --> 02:25:44.910]
If he wants to do the same, get out of here.

[02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:47.830]
I think the lifeguard was even enjoying.

[02:25:48.010 --> 02:25:53.110]
It was a good thing that the moral minority police weren't there.

[02:25:53.650 --> 02:26:01.990]
The other thing is I was curious to know whether or not you knew of any place to find statistics on less murder or murder.

[02:26:06.690 --> 02:26:11.970]
If there's any place to find the statistics, yeah, you know, like in the Almanac, World Almanac, that'll have it in there.

[02:26:12.390 --> 02:26:12.710]
Yeah.

[02:26:12.970 --> 02:26:13.250]
All right.

[02:26:13.370 --> 02:26:18.990]
Looking to find out that most of the countries like in Western Europe, they're very civilized and they maybe have like a handful of murders every year.

[02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:20.810]
We do better in this country on a good weekend.

[02:26:20.910 --> 02:26:27.530]
In fact, the guy in Atlanta killed more people in that one spree and that one day in a couple hours than some countries have in a whole year.

[02:26:27.530 --> 02:26:35.790]
Well, I was out the dinner at the other night, not to plug the place, but runway 84 up there on 84.

[02:26:36.670 --> 02:26:44.110]
And I was with a person there who was from England and he was saying that it just hardly ever happens even in London, you know, as far as people getting murdered.

[02:26:45.170 --> 02:26:46.290]
So, you know, I don't know.

[02:26:46.350 --> 02:26:47.450]
I don't know what's wrong with our country.

[02:26:47.950 --> 02:26:48.330]
It needs to be.

[02:26:48.370 --> 02:26:52.250]
Well, what do you mean you don't know what's wrong with it? It's a barbaric place. That's what's wrong with it.

[02:26:52.250 --> 02:26:59.990]
With people who have no value on human life and we got crazy people running around with guns and we got the politicians all terrified peeing in their pants about the gun lobby.

[02:27:00.130 --> 02:27:02.290]
And as a result, that's what's wrong with our country, man.

[02:27:02.670 --> 02:27:04.430]
It's a nut house.

[02:27:04.450 --> 02:27:05.190]
Got a band lobby.

[02:27:05.610 --> 02:27:06.310]
Got to get rid of them.

[02:27:06.310 --> 02:27:07.190]
Okay. All right.

[02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:08.350]
I'll see you in the lobby.

[02:27:09.550 --> 02:27:12.350]
That's what I said, but I went downstairs in the hotel yesterday morning.

[02:27:12.450 --> 02:27:13.110]
I took a look around.

[02:27:13.170 --> 02:27:14.470]
I said it's time to ban lobbies.

[02:27:14.890 --> 02:27:15.970]
That's what they're going to look like.

[02:27:17.070 --> 02:27:17.390]
Man.

[02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:19.690]
Spargers, here's Spargers.

[02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:20.790]
There are Spargers everywhere.

[02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:22.690]
I mean, is there a white person left here?

[02:27:22.830 --> 02:27:22.950]
No.

[02:27:23.270 --> 02:27:26.130]
Even the, even the, uh, the, uh, what you call it?

[02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:27.530]
It's one of the Bell boys were Spargers.

[02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.770]
No.

[02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.990]
And they don't even work there.

[02:27:29.470 --> 02:27:31.890]
I think they stole some uniforms over in the middle of the night.

[02:27:33.310 --> 02:27:36.450]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the eight.

[02:27:36.670 --> 02:27:38.670]
That would, that would be like taking a trip to Copenhagen.

[02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:40.850]
Flying all the way over there.

[02:27:41.570 --> 02:27:43.390]
Knowing that, you know, there's a lot of white people.

[02:27:43.550 --> 02:27:44.270]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:27:44.410 --> 02:27:45.230]
You're a white person.

[02:27:45.490 --> 02:27:46.010]
You want to go.

[02:27:46.090 --> 02:27:47.770]
There's a lot of white people when you go on vacation.

[02:27:48.150 --> 02:27:51.550]
Not because you're a bigot necessarily, although, I mean, so you go there to Copenhagen.

[02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:52.290]
You get off the plane.

[02:27:52.610 --> 02:27:55.170]
You get, they take you, they can't take you to the hotel.

[02:27:55.530 --> 02:27:57.110]
You get to the Sheraton Copenhagen hotel.

[02:27:57.210 --> 02:27:58.750]
And there's nothing but Spargers in there.

[02:28:01.230 --> 02:28:01.890]
And you go.

[02:28:02.130 --> 02:28:02.610]
Oh, God.

[02:28:02.850 --> 02:28:03.110]
Wow.

[02:28:04.290 --> 02:28:05.270]
What the hell is this?

[02:28:08.270 --> 02:28:12.330]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the eight TNT wireless line.

[02:28:12.330 --> 02:28:13.550]
I think it was an act.

[02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:17.230]
It was one of the most despicable things in the long history of this nation.

[02:28:17.950 --> 02:28:22.790]
To take black people from Africa, put them in crates, and bring them over here as slaves.

[02:28:23.850 --> 02:28:26.150]
And I think a way of evening that injustice out.

[02:28:29.410 --> 02:28:32.490]
What, no, what do you, I haven't even said it yet, and you're already smirking.

[02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:34.050]
Huh?

[02:28:35.370 --> 02:28:36.470]
We'll take up a collection.

[02:28:36.810 --> 02:28:40.090]
I'm not talking about all our dark friends, just the ones who don't listen to this show.

[02:28:40.090 --> 02:28:41.250]
They're all going back.

[02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:42.150]
They don't know it yet.

[02:28:43.970 --> 02:28:44.830]
Wouldn't that be great?

[02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:47.190]
Here's the Fort Myers.

[02:28:47.370 --> 02:28:47.490]
Hello.

[02:28:47.930 --> 02:28:48.470]
Hello, Neil.

[02:28:48.730 --> 02:28:49.050]
Yes, sir.

[02:28:49.310 --> 02:28:51.530]
You were talking last week about your ratings book there.

[02:28:51.810 --> 02:28:51.970]
Yes.

[02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:55.370]
Do you ever get the numbers from the station over on the coast over here?

[02:28:56.970 --> 02:28:57.370]
No.

[02:28:58.570 --> 02:29:01.430]
Because they were talking about on the other day, and it sounded like they were doing a lot better.

[02:29:01.590 --> 02:29:01.790]
Really?

[02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:02.190]
Yeah.

[02:29:02.330 --> 02:29:05.270]
How come they don't share that with information with us?

[02:29:05.570 --> 02:29:06.950]
How come they don't tell us anything?

[02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:08.430]
They just open up a pot.

[02:29:08.730 --> 02:29:11.190]
They put me on a year over there, and they tell us nothing.

[02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:13.350]
That's why I'm here to fill you in.

[02:29:13.570 --> 02:29:14.470]
So what did we do?

[02:29:14.690 --> 02:29:17.170]
Well, they didn't go into exact numbers, but they were real happy.

[02:29:17.390 --> 02:29:18.790]
The morning guy was up.

[02:29:18.810 --> 02:29:20.010]
I want to think of us some numbers.

[02:29:20.710 --> 02:29:21.250]
I don't know.

[02:29:21.550 --> 02:29:22.710]
Another update for you.

[02:29:22.770 --> 02:29:24.290]
Guess who's doing promos on that station?

[02:29:24.890 --> 02:29:25.610]
Cory Saban.

[02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.190]
Yeah.

[02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:28.090]
And so I thought that was interesting, too.

[02:29:28.190 --> 02:29:28.550]
That's great.

[02:29:28.650 --> 02:29:30.430]
I wonder how he's doing there on channel, whatever he's on.

[02:29:30.650 --> 02:29:33.010]
I haven't seen him on the TV yet, but he was doing promos.

[02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:34.070]
Can I ask one last favor?

[02:29:34.210 --> 02:29:34.350]
Yeah.

[02:29:34.490 --> 02:29:35.630]
Can I call somebody a douchebag?

[02:29:35.710 --> 02:29:35.850]
Yeah.

[02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:38.910]
Jeff Mitchell, you are a flamen douchebag.

[02:29:39.130 --> 02:29:39.550]
Okay, pal.

[02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:40.330]
Thanks for the good news.

[02:29:40.530 --> 02:29:44.730]
At least we get some information from our caller from over there and four buyers, which, of course, we don't have a toll-free liner.

[02:29:44.730 --> 02:29:45.970]
We'd have a lot of calls from over there.

[02:29:46.010 --> 02:29:46.290]
I'm sure.

[02:29:48.550 --> 02:29:49.650]
But it's so typical.

[02:29:49.790 --> 02:29:51.410]
This is the easily way of doing everything.

[02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:55.530]
It's called Lock Up, told you before I've used this exact expression, light and a vacuum.

[02:29:57.430 --> 02:30:00.050]
Your job is in a vacuum when you work here for this company.

[02:30:00.370 --> 02:30:02.390]
Everything that goes on in the show is in a vacuum.

[02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:04.790]
And that's primarily because, number one, they're in.

[02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:05.570]
That's the number two.

[02:30:05.890 --> 02:30:07.010]
We're not a sports thing.

[02:30:07.930 --> 02:30:10.370]
We don't wear jock straps when we do this show.

[02:30:11.010 --> 02:30:14.830]
Now, before I pointed out that football player is most of them don't wear jock straps.

[02:30:15.890 --> 02:30:20.270]
But the guys on our station, amazingly enough, the x-football players, they do.

[02:30:21.630 --> 02:30:24.630]
Even guys who never played the game, I don't want to mention no names.

[02:30:24.930 --> 02:30:27.510]
If they talk about sports, they come to work with it.

[02:30:27.570 --> 02:30:28.150]
That was funny.

[02:30:28.270 --> 02:30:28.710]
On a bike.

[02:30:30.810 --> 02:30:31.990]
26 past one.

[02:30:33.550 --> 02:30:35.830]
Two or three hundred open lines here for the last 35 minutes.

[02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:37.090]
It's going to be blazing, baby.

[02:30:37.190 --> 02:30:37.990]
It's going to be dynamite.

[02:30:38.490 --> 02:30:40.630]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound five.

[02:30:40.750 --> 02:30:41.130]
I'm sitting by.

[02:30:41.190 --> 02:30:45.210]
I'm sitting so far back in the chair that I may lose contact with a microphone in a minute.

[02:30:45.470 --> 02:30:47.190]
Not that I want to get out of here, fat, if you understand.

[02:30:47.470 --> 02:30:52.950]
I'm just backing away because I don't want to be associated with what's gone on here the last three hours and 25 minutes, but who's counting?

[02:30:53.790 --> 02:30:55.290]
God, has this been desperate?

[02:30:55.690 --> 02:30:56.110]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:30:56.330 --> 02:30:56.570]
Yes.

[02:30:56.950 --> 02:30:57.870]
Man, burst.

[02:30:58.210 --> 02:30:59.090]
Am I embarrassed by it?

[02:30:59.190 --> 02:30:59.370]
No.

[02:30:59.370 --> 02:31:05.530]
No, I'm embarrassed that I work on this radio station number one, and I'm especially embarrassed that I work with the sales department, especially John Penis.

[02:31:07.050 --> 02:31:08.530]
He is a disaster.

[02:31:08.850 --> 02:31:11.130]
He makes Todd Dreck look like a good human man.

[02:31:11.490 --> 02:31:12.110]
How do you like that?

[02:31:13.450 --> 02:31:13.910]
Not really.

[02:31:14.090 --> 02:31:15.010]
Well, but at any rate.

[02:31:19.450 --> 02:31:20.270]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:22.430 --> 02:31:23.250]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:24.850 --> 02:31:25.670]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.710]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:25.710 --> 02:31:25.710]

[02:31:25.710 --> 02:31:25.730]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:25.730]

[02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:25.730]

[02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:25.730]

[02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:25.730]

[02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:25.730]

[02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:25.730]

[02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:25.730]

[02:31:25.790 --> 02:31:26.950]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:27.150 --> 02:31:27.210]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:32.890 --> 02:31:33.710]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:33.710 --> 02:31:33.710]

[02:31:33.710 --> 02:31:34.110]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:34.110 --> 02:31:34.710]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:34.710 --> 02:31:35.250]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:35.250 --> 02:31:36.270]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:36.310 --> 02:31:36.970]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:37.710 --> 02:31:38.530]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:38.830 --> 02:31:39.510]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:39.950 --> 02:31:40.790]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:41.570 --> 02:31:42.250]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:42.250 --> 02:31:42.790]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.670]
I'm sorry.

[02:31:45.290 --> 02:31:46.810]
That's the place for me.

[02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:49.870]
I got the brand new Nike Pen I'm ready to die.

[02:31:50.250 --> 02:31:52.430]
A poison jello with the rest of the guys.

[02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:53.910]
We're going to do it spacious.

[02:31:54.130 --> 02:31:55.010]
They can't be seen.

[02:31:55.390 --> 02:31:57.590]
Our schools will be taken by a particle beam.

[02:31:58.010 --> 02:32:00.130]
Canceration is the only thing that bothers me.

[02:32:00.270 --> 02:32:02.670]
You got to sit down to see me.

[02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:05.310]
You know I think the poison is affected me.

[02:32:05.530 --> 02:32:07.390]
It's the hellbop conical or me.

[02:32:07.390 --> 02:32:07.390]

[02:32:15.310 --> 02:32:16.030]
I'm sorry.

[02:32:16.030 --> 02:32:16.030]

[02:32:16.030 --> 02:32:16.030]

[02:32:16.030 --> 02:32:16.030]

[02:32:16.030 --> 02:32:16.030]

[02:32:16.030 --> 02:32:16.030]

[02:32:16.030 --> 02:32:16.870]
I'm sorry.

[02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:17.750]
I'm sorry.

[02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.990]

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

[02:36:46.470 --> 02:36:49.230]
Well, I started by saying that the house that side has no long

[02:36:49.230 --> 02:36:49.850]
and there has not existed.

[02:36:49.950 --> 02:36:53.190]
I started by saying that.

[02:36:53.350 --> 02:36:56.090]
But the resolve of their responsibility.

[02:36:57.230 --> 02:36:58.110]
But the resolve of their responsibility.

[02:36:58.110 --> 02:36:59.750]
There's a lot of hope.

[02:36:59.750 --> 02:37:00.290]
There's a bit of hope.

[02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:06.450]
There's a bit of hope.

[02:37:06.450 --> 02:37:09.670]
i don't want to be twenty twenty twenty twenty i didn't see anybody force anyone

[02:37:09.670 --> 02:37:12.130]
to drink i think i would like to see it

[02:37:12.130 --> 02:37:15.870]
and i don't want to be a minute in the city because the thing wasn't on video

[02:37:15.870 --> 02:37:19.590]
tape thank god we don't have to see them dying out of their own puke but the fact

[02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:22.930]
is you know as well as i did that during hazing you have to go through these

[02:37:22.930 --> 02:37:25.070]
things are they're going to turn you down they give you an offer you can't

[02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:29.110]
refuse in my fraternity where i was an officer we eliminated hazing

[02:37:29.110 --> 02:37:32.210]
you have made some ridiculous and that and it still goes on

[02:37:32.210 --> 02:37:35.970]
but i mean that's individual you know why our fraternities necessary what's

[02:37:35.970 --> 02:37:39.370]
the point well i'll give you a point i mean this kind of makes me a jerk but

[02:37:39.370 --> 02:37:43.210]
article one says congress shall make no right is the same one i'm not talking

[02:37:43.210 --> 02:37:46.670]
about whether they're on whether they're legal or not i'm saying what you

[02:37:46.670 --> 02:37:51.070]
right what it's the same law that protects you in your job it's the right to free

[02:37:51.070 --> 02:37:56.570]
speech it's the right to have a response to my question my question is what do

[02:37:56.570 --> 02:37:59.830]
we need them for now whether they're legal or not what is the point what do you

[02:37:59.830 --> 02:38:04.050]
need them for when i was in school i learned how to organize things i learned

[02:38:04.050 --> 02:38:08.070]
how to be responsible i learned how to make sure that people were responsible

[02:38:08.070 --> 02:38:12.050]
as an officer the fraternity i learned how to build floats that's a

[02:38:12.050 --> 02:38:14.630]
ridiculous thing there's a lot of things you learn it's the same thing as the

[02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:18.750]
boy scouts i mean you know you know you know what the boy scouts is another story

[02:38:18.750 --> 02:38:21.810]
but i mean you and i understand that you can learn things and be responsible

[02:38:21.810 --> 02:38:25.650]
behave if you're eighteen if you're eighteen and you open your mouth and you

[02:38:25.650 --> 02:38:28.350]
swallow out all the things you're the operative work

[02:38:28.350 --> 02:38:31.830]
well i just don't see i'm going to let me say it again you know i say on a one

[02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:34.870]
hand you didn't allow a hazing and then you're turning around and saying well if

[02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:38.290]
you do it voluntarily it's your fault no let me say it again when you when it

[02:38:38.290 --> 02:38:42.410]
what if you drink it your fault how can you blame the system you can blame the

[02:38:42.410 --> 02:38:46.650]
school because they said it didn't die because he drank he died because he was

[02:38:46.650 --> 02:38:50.570]
in a hazing incident and they forced it to drink more than he any he wasn't even a

[02:38:50.570 --> 02:38:53.830]
drinker to begin with which is what i think it's worse but if you're eighteen

[02:38:53.830 --> 02:38:57.390]
years old how can you blame a bunch in addition to what you're all you can break the

[02:38:57.390 --> 02:39:01.310]
new idea but the drinking age is an eighteen a Massachusetts okay was against

[02:39:01.310 --> 02:39:05.210]
the law talking about the law you know we tell you right now they were breaking

[02:39:05.210 --> 02:39:08.810]
the law i agree with you ninety five percent of the time but let me ask you this

[02:39:08.810 --> 02:39:13.490]
how can you blame anyone else for your actions how can you do that that's not

[02:39:13.490 --> 02:39:17.770]
fair you can't blame your your your your the old thing about a dog chasing its

[02:39:17.770 --> 02:39:20.750]
tail around in the circle that's what you're doing have a wonderful life okay

[02:39:21.490 --> 02:39:25.410]
i stand by what i said it's a waste of time and i hope you have a nice time

[02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:04.140]
so over but I think I did enjoy always play the same role no except for King of Comedy

[02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:09.860]
Rubberpuck and that was good didn't see that that was very good thank god the other thing I went to

[02:42:09.860 --> 02:42:15.620]
an Ivy League University in the seventies uh-huh and the sororities were banned in the fifties because

[02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:20.160]
the girls told them killed themselves because they didn't get the right one but the fraternities

[02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:24.240]
prevailed to this day because they donate more money and are the future leaders of the world

[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:30.620]
but um the thing that was like so aggravating about them they they had their housing right in the

[02:42:30.620 --> 02:42:35.500]
middle of campus they had their private dining halls which were on the periphery of a normal dining

[02:42:35.500 --> 02:42:40.300]
hall and they figured us uh financial aid students like craft like they'd load up their their

[02:42:40.300 --> 02:42:46.480]
trays with not not three glasses but ten glasses of chocolate milk and put cigarettes and paper and

[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:51.500]
just make it sort of disgusting you know and just just treat everybody else like learn the

[02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:55.720]
fraternities were the best you know we can get away with date rape and you know dragon

[02:42:55.720 --> 02:43:00.420]
fresh and it's the Ivy League schools that those are my favorite those nudy Ivy League schools

[02:43:00.420 --> 02:43:03.380]
where they alcohol crawl with their nose up in the air because they're too good for everybody else

[02:43:03.380 --> 02:43:08.080]
I don't want to mention that the Kennedys went to schools like that well you know offered some

[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:14.960]
normal and Yale Princeton schools like that were they too good for everybody else and they're a

[02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:19.620]
normal financial aid folks squeaked through there and came out and you know listen to Neil and

[02:43:19.620 --> 02:43:24.360]
you know our prosperous and and and aren't fraternities and that might even learn to make a float

[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:29.100]
yeah but um we didn't have floats at our school I don't know maybe our fraternities weren't as good

[02:43:29.100 --> 02:43:33.000]
as we were. Yeah I think I think he's right for this all floated. You gotta go to the U.M.

[02:43:33.180 --> 02:43:38.400]
okay yeah take it easy bye bye five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty what do you think

[02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:44.200]

[02:43:55.180 --> 02:43:58.560]
sit there in the theater the whole two hours trying to wait for something to happen and the

[02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:03.120]
ending nothing happened. Isn't that pathetic? I had to kiss the whole movie and uh I waited for

[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:07.340]
the ending and nearly ruptured my bladder and got nothing out of it. The second thing I don't

[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:12.320]
know if you've warned the audience about is haunting another big time piece of crap and I hope that

[02:44:12.820 --> 02:44:17.080]
people out there don't go see it and the third thing is about fraternities if you're paying for your

[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:21.660]
friends where's the logic in that you know you're bigger losing everybody else and you go around you

[02:44:21.660 --> 02:44:26.220]
know yeah that's very well put just like that sort of facts that got crushed I mean people who

[02:44:26.220 --> 02:44:30.400]
are joined fraternities are obviously big big losers who are desperate looking to latch on to

[02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:34.480]
somebody else with their money or with your money. Yeah you're paying for your friends and

[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:38.640]
and you go around you know gloating that you're doing that that's real smart you know. Anyway thanks

[02:44:38.660 --> 02:44:43.900]

[02:45:02.260 --> 02:45:06.620]
like I said just like a little dog chasing its tail round and around and around and the first

[02:45:06.620 --> 02:45:09.920]
amendment this and I just ask him one simple question what is the purpose of it.

[02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:16.460]
Bapapapapa and he floated away. Here's your field be chill out. Hey how you doing Neil okay sir.

[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:21.200]
Yeah I just want to call that fat boy a douchebag because I just graduated college and my roommate

[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:26.080]
was in a fraternity right and he has the biggest loser in the world. He's an asshole oh I couldn't

[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:30.260]
believe it. I'm like you sir I want to tell you some you show me a guy who's in a fraternity

[02:45:30.260 --> 02:45:34.260]
and I'll tell you he's an asshole right off the bat before even meet him. He's nose is so far off

[02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:38.640]
right that's right and it's just like oh I have more money than anybody else so I can pay for my

[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:43.960]
friends and my women and I drive better cars than the president or university I mean it's disgusting.

[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:51.340]
Are we impressed. Okay pal thanks a lot Neil. Have a great day. There you go we take grave

[02:45:51.340 --> 02:45:55.220]
exception to all you fraternity people okay we don't want to put you in your place but nevertheless

[02:45:55.220 --> 02:46:00.160]
