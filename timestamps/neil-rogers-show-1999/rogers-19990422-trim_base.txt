[00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:08.600]
Sport Radio 560 WQAM Iami Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Roger Show to talk to Neil

[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.940]
called 560 560 toll free for date and grabberd or pound 560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.500]
No, the opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not necessarily

[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.800]
reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisitions or the easily no no no.

[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.780]
Now Neil Rogers on Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.800]
Then coach, get away from the ball mother f***er.

[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.960]
Here I let it.

[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.800]
I don't know if you remember me.

[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.220]
But I was the guy whose house you said I'm fire last year.

[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.220]
Huh?

[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.660]
Please let it go.

[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.300]
I'm not dead yet.

[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:35.120]
Dear Atlantis, I want to tell you that the guy you saw with your best friend that wasn't me.

[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.620]
He kind of looked and talked just like me but that's surely purely coincidental.

[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.240]
I was nowhere near that place.

[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.520]
I love you too much to look at anyone else.

[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.140]
Dear Atlantis, I had a dentist appointment.

[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.080]
I was nowhere near the Sharon Smedall Inn Hotel.

[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.880]
I would never cheat on somebody who treats me so good.

[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.680]
Whins all those rambies, ads all that money.

[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.660]
Come on, let me out of the pit.

[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.920]
10.202 560 WQAM, happy Thursday to him.

[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.040]
So anyway, I've got the most distressing job here this morning.

[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.400]
God, how do I break this but sucking thing to the audience?

[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.800]
Well, they won't be surprised.

[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.640]
Well, I didn't hear it myself.

[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.480]
Although somebody who was at my house last night watching the first two periods of the Buffalo Auto a Playoff game,

[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.120]
somebody who I treated to dinner last night, well, I didn't really treat you if Cohen treated him to dinner at the pizza lock.

[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.880]
I don't want to mention Jeff Rumor.

[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.320]
He said, oh, yeah, they asked me to be on the Marmor and to call him on the award team because we got depots out of town.

[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.500]
And of course, Geldy's the only one I'm sure that knows even a little bit about hockey.

[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.420]
So they want to talk about what the playoffs coming up, etc. starting.

[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.140]
Okay, am I going to get up at, you know, I mean, I was up at him.

[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.360]
I'm going to turn on the radio in the house 7.45 in the morning.

[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.920]
No. To this station, especially.

[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.780]
No. Of course not.

[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.140]
But when I get inside the building, I hear the most distressing, the most unbelievable.

[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.980]
Well, let me just set the stage for this.

[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.540]
Okay, set the table, so to speak, without the silverware.

[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.520]
So you know, Rumor sets me up his mother-of-laws in town.

[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.180]
And so, you know, he doesn't want to like him pose on his wife and his mother-of-law.

[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.840]
They have to be sitting there watching hockey games with a playoff son.

[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.680]
So in actually one, I come over to my house to watch a hockey game.

[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.600]
You know, great. No problem. I got to satellite dishes, big screen TV.

[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.480]
And how about buying him dinner before the game would be good?

[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.540]
Well, he didn't really say that. But if Rumor says let's go to dinner, it means he ain't buying.

[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.360]
So you figure it out.

[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.980]
So I got even with him. I said, okay, I'll make you the pizza law five o'clock.

[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.080]
Knowing that the price would be right and the food would be very good, which it was.

[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.580]
Thanks, ponytail.

[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.200]
I'm going to cut it in the hour that we were there.

[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.200]
I picked up enough material to like blackmail at least 50 different people.

[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.860]
It does unbelievable. Amazing.

[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.800]
I could be tired right now this minute.

[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.360]
So anyway, we, you know, we're sitting there and the help they're very friendly to me.

[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.380]
Oh yeah, near Rogers is here. They call off ponytail.

[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.440]
Wasn't there at the moment on the cell phone. He comes rushing into the restaurant.

[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.860]
So he sits down and he says to us.

[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.440]
He said, gee, if you guys would have told me you were coming tonight,

[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.020]
I would have taken out and bought you both dinner at someplace better.

[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.400]
His little brand of humor, you know ponytail and remember responds without a pause,

[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.740]
without a hesitation. How much of our night?

[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.820]
True story.

[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.940]
Oh, I'm just kidding. I'm just, yeah, you're just kidding, right?

[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.840]
Anybody believe me just kidding? No, of course not.

[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.840]
So I come in here this morning and I'm, I just, I don't know what to say about this.

[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.460]
You know, because George and Rimmer hate each other like poison,

[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.120]
which I still haven't figured out what that's all about.

[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.200]
I don't mean dislike. I don't mean despise hate.

[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.500]
Hate. In fact, I told him that you were going to be doing a show and I'm on vacation just

[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.440]
psychotic. He was doing cartwheel summer solts.

[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.680]
So I guess he's not going to listen. He'll be listening because I'm sure you'll be talking about him,

[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.220]
won't you? Well, I'll be talking about my client said about him.

[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.360]
Okay. Oh, now he'll be listening. Yeah.

[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.700]
And so will everybody else?

[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.180]
So I guess I just should play it, you know, and I'd be around the bush.

[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.340]
She calls in this morning on the worst team.

[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.740]
So does I now even hear the rest of it ostensibly to talk about the NHL playoffs.

[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.560]
But somewhere in a conversation came up an opportunity to do a major league suck job.

[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.560]
What's going to happen with that radio job in your opinion?

[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.220]
Oh, the radio jojo.

[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.080]
Yeah, the radio play by play now. It's crazy.

[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.060]
I think I think obviously Goldie, based on his bench hitting performance,

[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.040]
has got to be considered as a serious candidate.

[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.320]
One thing about Steve Goldstein, I think you'll agree with me, Joe,

[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.020]
you know better than anybody in all seriousness.

[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.660]
I respect the work that Steve Goldstein puts in.

[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.380]
Be it preparing for a Panther radio broadcast,

[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.640]
I've had the fortune of working with Joe at QA,

[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.860]
or not with Joe, but with Goldie at QAM.

[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.000]
And Joe, I think Goldie's a hard worker, and I really respect that.

[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.860]
And I think he's got to be considered the next.

[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.740]
Well, you have been strong. What do you go for him?

[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.960]
What a suck up job that was.

[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.940]
I mean, I can't find words.

[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.320]
There are no words that have been invented yet to describe the suction.

[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.180]
When I heard that, I almost fell off this chair and on the ground.

[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.220]
Not that I know that he doesn't really believe that.

[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.440]
Anybody believe that not that I know?

[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.480]
Yeah, right.

[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.340]
I mean, why do people feel compelled?

[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.380]
Why is this market so full of suck holes?

[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.760]
Are they all lyricaly wannabes?

[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.280]
Is that it?

[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.980]
They think they're going to make it to the top by sucking their way to the top?

[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.380]
Kissing cottage cheese ass all the way to the top?

[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.000]
Unbelievable.

[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.840]
This man no more believes that Gildi ought to be doing the Panther games next season.

[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.660]
Then he's going to pay for the next 10 dinners.

[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.240]
There is a China man's chance in hell.

[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.960]
I think I'm just going to play that from now to two over and over again.

[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.600]
How many times have I got ballistic on here here, telling you about all the suction that goes on?

[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.380]
That's basically what this town is all about.

[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.480]
That's the biggest, well, one of the big problems with this town.

[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:52.820]
Too many suck holes.

[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.820]
Very few people are really having an honest opinion and are willing to take a chance and express it.

[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.520]
But you know, you don't have to go out of the way.

[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.900]
I mean, oh, it makes my skin crawl.

[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.280]
How about tonight?

[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.860]
Save it for next time.

[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.320]
We got to find that alligator arms, by the way.

[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.480]
Whatever.

[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.000]
Did he come in here one day and like takes it out of our DCS, alligator arms?

[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.040]
Unbelievable.

[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.220]
The man with arms, too short to everywhere.

[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.600]
I mean, a couple of times I've noticed him try to reach for the check with the arms.

[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.820]
Just, you know, can't reach far enough.

[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.100]
Even if they put it like right in front of his little hands, they just can't reach out there and grab that check.

[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.700]
Major, major.

[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.780]
What a suck up job that was.

[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.560]
Suck up job.

[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.720]
The worst.

[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.880]
Well, I would say that was the worst suck up job I ever heard in my life.

[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.660]
Larry King couldn't come close to it.

[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.580]
The Humper couldn't compete with it.

[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.260]
There was nobody in the history of mankind.

[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:53.180]
Even the biggest marshmallow tossers, the biggest butlickers, the biggest name droppers, could never come close to matching that rumor.

[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:54.940]
Man.

[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:03.060]
Not just insincere, but a flat out blatant pile of big oozing smelly crap.

[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.220]
You know what that was.

[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:05.700]
Crap.

[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.540]
But just keep it up.

[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.660]
Because the sports nerds who listen to this station, they eat that stuff up anyway.

[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.280]
They put mayonnaise on it.

[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.300]
You know, the Dutch put mayonnaise on their French fries.

[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.340]
Well, the South Florida sports nerds, they put mayonnaise on their craft.

[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.240]
And they love it.

[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.040]
Breakfast lunch and dinner.

[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.040]
Wait till I share my first bags within a minute.

[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:27.520]
Great.

[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.600]
Starts off my morning on a real high note.

[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:31.740]
Great bags.

[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.500]
For another one of our gonahuggers out there in Radio Land, I love it.

[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.060]
I'm not sure if we have to stop.

[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.020]
And then we'll do it that.

[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.100]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:23.080]
And then I'll get up and I make a track, a couple of toasts, and the puddles coming back every night Get a thrill when I roll that weed, talk to about my favorite stuff to do on your sea, make some extra cash and I'll sell you a lit of two

[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:38.420]
I hold it all up for the snow to pass, but I'm gonna hate to take that cure and test, my back forages worth got only those with the illegal grass grows.

[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:39.500]
Oh, right.

[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.420]
Not that you have to stop.

[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.280]
And this is what stuff is giving off, right?

[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.040]
I don't think you have to stop.

[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:58.220]
That 14 here at Sucks and Central, maybe 560 WQA in this town, and I'm telling you, someday it'll be just like that big black hole that they're always talking about in outer space.

[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:06.080]
Just disappear off the map, it'll just get sucked right down into the center of the earth, maybe even Pat Boone will be down in there, or James Dehran, or whoever was in that movie.

[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.680]
Who was it? Well, one of them.

[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.560]
Maybe it was Pat Goon.

[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:23.740]
Nice suck job there, Rimmer Fony, Fony, Fony, Insancer, unbelievable shameful, shameful, a disgraceful display, a totally unacceptable display of just this on it, of just the crap.

[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:31.400]
Here is a man who, and I agree with him, how could that voice possibly be on the air when any reference made to guilty?

[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:38.000]
That squeaky, that tune out that voice, you know, I mean, guilty's not a bad guy, but that voice, you know, he's gotta overcome that voice.

[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:49.440]
And he comes on here this morning, and just gratuitously out of nowhere, just to be a suckle says what you heard, which I'll play again 20 or 30 times, just to make sure, no, we gotta pinch ourselves to make sure, look at that, I'm itching already.

[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.380]
I'm sure I'm itching, I have an allergy from here in that.

[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.460]
It's how I'll agitated my system is from hearing that crap.

[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.320]
Here's a great fact before I get to my gun facts from John, by the way.

[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.780]
Here's a great fact from a guy named Jim.

[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:30.840]
Carl Sagan often said that American kids were so capable of violence not because of TV or movies or musical junk food, or not going to Sunday school, or any of these other bowl shot reasons, the right wing is from with the mouth about, but because we as a society are so bizarrely frightened of the idea of teenage sex that adolescent simmer restrained in a pressure cooker full of hormones until they have to break loose somehow often explosively, which is you have so often pointed out does not happen in most other advanced countries.

[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:41.180]
The few who do view sex with the same, what does it say with the same idiotic fear is that we Americans always seem to have the same violent leanings most Islamic countries, for example, there you go.

[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:52.440]
Think about this, is that it veiled reference? Think about this, he says any country Americans visit because they consider it either a paradise or just a great place is fundamentally free of morality about teenage and most other sexuality.

[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.820]
You know what your right says Jim, get me my passport, I'm getting the F out of this place, I want to move somewhere that civilized.

[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:07.220]
Nice go on Jim, excellent fact right on, what on target and then of course become the first facts that I got out of the machine this morning.

[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:14.820]
Which I don't want to carry on again, yesterday with a spectacular great show if I say so myself, where you in show nice going Neil, thank you.

[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.880]
And then of course I get here the right to the station going on about what you think the bears can drive the running back.

[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:28.260]
Seriously, I don't feel sorry for those people, I feel sorry for us that were surrounded by idiots like that.

[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:39.700]
I mean here we've just been through a massacre of young people right here in the middle of this country and these people are nothing deters them from their appointed stupidity.

[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.880]
That's all I know about, that's all they know, that's the beginning and the end of their resistance.

[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.420]
You idiots out there that keep asking me, well what's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of their lives?

[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:54.640]
Huh? I mean what's the ball score stop coming in, is their life even worth living at all?

[00:12:54.700 --> 00:13:02.600]
No, good question. So anyway, John faxes me this, here you go and it's interesting there's a little white out in here, you must have put a word in there.

[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.340]
I don't want to say it might have started with in or something like that.

[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:18.580]
But you'll figure it out, he says just a thought to ponder Neil, if you went to sleep tonight and three hours later woke up to wait and then there's a white out there, you know, large figure standing at the foot of your bed with a black ski mask.

[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:32.040]
See you got the black in there but just he moved it around a little bit. Could have been a brown ski mask, a orange ski mask, any any kind of black ski mask and a six inch knife in his hand, you would sell your soul to the devil to have immediate access to a gun.

[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.920]
I saw my soul to the devil, no, I just borrowed the devil's pitch fork.

[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:45.160]
Sure do better than that stupid knife that guy, I mean six, he's only got six inches this guy in the knife too. That's not a nice, that's just a little, you know, that's like a letter opener.

[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:46.100]
Huh?

[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.300]
This is the focus says John of the NRA.

[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.840]
Anybody believes John by the way that this is the focus of the NRA?

[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.900]
Not to simply own a gun but to protect ourselves and family with it says John, right.

[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:10.980]
That's why all your kids are out there shooting each other up low and he said his brains out committing either suicide with it or accidentally playing around with them and blowing their own brains out.

[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.620]
You know, it's like, we all know what that is.

[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.240]
That's the American top point.

[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.120]
There you go, that's right. Come on, have another one.

[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:28.920]
And it's interesting because this whole business out there in Denver, NRA cancels portions of the Denver Convention as a result of what happened the two days ago.

[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:39.920]
As horrifying details of the massacre had column by in high school, I continued to merge yesterday with public and legislators in Colorado shocked their colleagues by killing.

[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:45.480]
That's just pardon the expression killing two pro gun measures headed for passage within a matter of days.

[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:56.940]
Even before police could learn where the Colorado killers acquired their guns, Colorado governor Bill O'Hunting several Republican leaders in the state retreated from their earlier support of those two major gun bills.

[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:05.420]
The withdrawal of those bills was a stunning victory for gun control forces who have viewed Colorado as an important test after Missouri voters in April 6.

[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.740]
The majority of us in this country aren't in love with guns. We don't want to see everybody in their brother running around with guns.

[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:26.680]
We don't believe that most people have got some kind of right, somewhere that they read into the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:31.620]
They have an arsenal of weapons in their basement and their garage in the backyard in their...

[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:38.900]
They're right wherever they're hiding them, okay? Hate to break the news to you, John. But that's the way the majority of sane people in this country think we're not in love with our guns, okay?

[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.820]
Or your gun or anybody else's guns.

[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.000]
You son of a bitch.

[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:42.580]
Well, too bad.

[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:52.100]
And then of course right here in the Sunshine State, what somebody called in about this yesterday, Florida lawmaker delays debate on gun lawsuits.

[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.020]
It would be an inappropriate time to hear it says the House Speaker, John Trasher.

[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.080]
And what were they going to debate yesterday?

[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:05.580]
A proposed law to ban local governments lawsuits against gun makers, including one filed by a date county this year.

[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.380]
The bill would even ban pending lawsuits like that one and the other ones that are pending.

[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.920]
So in other words, let's make sure we get the gun makers off the hook is what that bill was all about.

[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.920]
But they canceled the Florida debate yesterday because the timing would have been real bad.

[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:30.840]
It would have been real embarrassing to point out that our right wingers here in the state of Florida, our gun nuts, our gun huggers,

[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:38.060]
are trying to do everything in their power to protect the gun makers, to protect everybody and their brother who's got as many guns as they want.

[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.080]
And I'm going to tell you something.

[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.460]
I've been through this a zillion times.

[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.040]
It's like the abortion thing. It's like anything that's tired, old issues.

[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.140]
It's never... It's a waste of time.

[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.480]
It's a waste of my time in your time because just like I said before, it just ain't going to change.

[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.920]
That's the American fucking way.

[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.140]
That's right. That's just what it is.

[00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:01.880]
I'm not saying people ought to give up trying because if you've had your life, but nevertheless, it's going to be a long time before any serious inroads are made.

[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:08.120]
Because this is a country that's obsessed with guns and violence and believe me, that's not a very good combination.

[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.860]
Not a good combination.

[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.020]
Guns violence and a respect for human life.

[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.840]
There's the third one. There's the trifecta for you.

[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.220]
Put those together and you got...

[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.640]
What a dead people is what you got.

[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.840]
You got a barbaric place, like I said yesterday.

[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.420]
It's not a civilized country.

[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.500]
You can keep pretending that I'm a bad guy.

[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.720]
I got some kind of an agenda.

[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.660]
Well, whatever you want to say, you can attack me all you want with your bull crap.

[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.020]
But the fact is, it's the truth.

[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.600]
It's a barbaric country.

[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.620]
Civilized country people aren't walking around shooting each other.

[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:43.320]
Kids aren't picking up baddies, gun and bull and their brains out and their classmates and their friends and their brothers and sisters.

[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.540]
It's unheard of.

[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.780]
You can try to trace it to movies.

[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:52.780]
You can try to taste it.

[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.420]
It traces it to TV.

[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.000]
Whatever you want.

[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.100]
But the American public has developed an insatiable appetite for violence.

[00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.320]
Insatiable.

[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.420]
That's why we have extreme everything.

[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:07.160]
Extreme wrestling, extreme violence, faces of death parts 1 through 5,000.

[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.380]
Extreme, you fell into black.

[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.620]
Extreme violence.

[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.020]
Just plain ordinary violence.

[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.700]
That's not fun anymore.

[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.380]
That's no good anymore.

[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.880]
And you know what's really interesting.

[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:29.760]
They were showing some clips from a couple of movies, including that one movie gear to teenagers with her and the school they're blowing everybody away with rifles and shotguns.

[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.960]
I don't know what the name of that movie is.

[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:37.440]
And I'm thinking to myself, kids can go see these movies, even if they're like PG, whatever, you know, if they have an adult with them.

[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.120]
That's okay.

[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.760]
But unless they're 18, they can't go see like a porn movie.

[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:43.640]
They can't see sex.

[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.000]
But all the violence that they've ever been invented, no problem at all.

[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.960]
See this movie that they were showing, Clockwork Orange, remember had an X rating?

[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:54.680]
And it was nothing.

[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:55.880]
I mean, there was some violence in it.

[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.660]
There was some sexual, you know, innuendo.

[00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:58.840]
But nothing.

[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.660]
And of course, Malcolm and Dowell's are slung.

[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.280]
That was in there too.

[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.060]
But other than that.

[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.660]
But they're kind of gratuitous violence in these movies.

[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.140]
And I'm not saying that if you go see a movie, that's an excuse because you got the decided it was a good idea to kill somebody.

[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.740]
But just think of the different set of standards we're talking about there, okay?

[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.800]
Okay, to go see that no matter what your age really, they'll get you in.

[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.380]
But God forbid there should be people, you know, having sex, anything sexual.

[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.280]
Oh my God, unless you're at least 50, we don't want you to see that.

[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.120]
And only with a note from your grandpa.

[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.520]
America is neurotic about sex.

[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.640]
So Jim with his facts, you're right on target sweetheart.

[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.960]
And as far as John and your facts, first of all, he got a good security system.

[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.780]
And you got a little dog that barks a lot.

[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:47.320]
I'm not really worried about some guy with a big black ski mask getting into my house, standing there with his six inches or his knife either.

[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.080]
I'm not really too worried about it.

[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.460]
I don't think you'd make it that far, okay, Jim?

[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.660]
John, whatever your name was.

[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.380]
Here's a lady mobile in somewhere.

[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:55.700]
Hello.

[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.200]
Hello.

[00:19:59.060 --> 00:19:59.680]
Lady mobile.

[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.140]
What happened to her?

[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.200]
What just happened to the phone?

[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.620]
What just happened to my life?

[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.380]
I see a flashing before my eyes.

[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.600]
I'm pressing the button only she's not on.

[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.760]
I can't press her off.

[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:09.720]
She isn't going off.

[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.840]
Oh please don't tell me this is happening today.

[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:12.640]
Not to me.

[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.640]
What is this?

[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.320]
Another Greg Reed deal here with our great equipment that never works?

[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:20.700]
Look at that.

[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.140]
I can't put her on.

[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.400]
I can't, let's try it again.

[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:23.680]
Hello.

[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.440]
Okay, let's try one more.

[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.660]
Here's a mobile in Halea.

[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:27.880]
Hello.

[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.760]
And you can tell that they're not going to be on because the screen is like,

[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.940]
hello, going once, going twice.

[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.040]
How about line five and Davy?

[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:37.260]
Hello.

[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.640]
And as soon as I punch it up, whatever you've written on there where they are that goes out.

[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.340]
So guess what boys and girls?

[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.720]
Our phone system in this room doesn't work today.

[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.780]
So I want to screen, let's see if that helps.

[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:48.480]
WQAM.

[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.280]
Hello.

[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.100]
No, it's just line and use elsewhere.

[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.000]
This whole phone system is totally F-D.

[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.540]
And you wonder, you wonder that we have actually have people, I mean, if you've been listening

[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.360]
a long time, you probably shouldn't wonder anymore.

[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.780]
But those of you who think that I get carried away, that I go overboard, you wonder why I go ballistic

[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.460]
about working for people like this?

[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:19.260]
We're from one day to the next, you come in, and you have no idea if anything is going to be working.

[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:26.520]
This is the most unbelievable, cheap ass, horse ball outfit I have ever worked for in my life.

[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.700]
I work for stations that aren't even on air anymore in Marshall, Michigan, places like that.

[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.920]
And they were more professional in this horse ball outfit.

[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.620]
Let me try line seven, mobile in, and I press it up and mobile in and the Miami goes out.

[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.720]
So the whole phone system is out.

[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.020]
It's done, it's history.

[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:43.640]
Great.

[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.680]
Left here yesterday at two o'clock, phones were working fine, they were sizzling off the hook yesterday.

[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.100]
We did a radio show in here.

[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:53.940]
Come back in the next day.

[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.180]
Does anything work?

[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:55.520]
No.

[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:55.860]
No.

[00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.780]
Only at WQAM.

[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.200]
Tank tries to get on the air every single day.

[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.680]
You can almost bait your life on it.

[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.940]
Within the first five minutes, they're going to lose the line.

[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.480]
He's out of the chula, his line goes out.

[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.060]
He's up at Louisville, his line goes out.

[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.520]
This is a technical disaster, it's a technical horror show is what this is.

[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.000]
What's the point of getting upset about it?

[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.580]
What am I screaming and yelling and getting wild about it?

[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.080]
It goes on all the time.

[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.880]
In fact, the days that we ought to be surprised are the days when a damn thing works.

[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.400]
Oh, and you guys are going to get a great new phone system up there.

[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.020]
The state of the art.

[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.180]
Did we get a new phone system?

[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.160]
Was it another lie from our general manager who's showing his ass to the world?

[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.640]
I just another bunch of bull crap.

[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:40.520]
Unbelievable.

[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.320]
This is, don't bring your daughter to work day today.

[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.980]
So Georgia's got his daughter subring here.

[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.280]
They subring you're getting a chance to see what a horse ball place this really is.

[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.140]
It's just unbelievable.

[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.240]
So what are we doing, boys and girls?

[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.100]
Let's do a break.

[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.300]
That's what we're good for here.

[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.580]
We can always get the spots on here.

[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.780]
We can't get the programs on here, but we can get those spots on here, baby.

[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.280]
Let's put this place all about.

[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.420]
All spots are radio.

[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.160]
Okay, let's hop right into it.

[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.460]
Okay, let's not waste any time.

[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.900]
1031 at 560 or make believe radio station.

[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.480]
You're a tinker toy station for the 90s.

[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.480]
Let's see if this works.

[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.420]
Okay, I don't think it will.

[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.400]
Here's a lady mobile.

[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.160]
It's going to work.

[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.080]
Mobile in Pembercline.

[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:15.320]
Hello.

[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:15.940]
Neil.

[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:16.520]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.360]
Hey, it's working.

[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.160]
Why does that work?

[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.160]
I don't know.

[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.420]
I could hear you the whole time.

[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.620]
I know why it worked because I got rid of that.

[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.860]
I did something on it.

[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.460]
One button there.

[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.180]
I think that's what it did.

[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.080]
But anyway, there you are.

[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:25.760]
Okay, good.

[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.380]
What a miracle.

[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:27.880]
Thank God.

[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:28.720]
Thank God.

[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.340]
Thank God.

[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:29.760]
Thank God.

[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:30.700]
Thank God.

[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.260]
That's a family bushing that button.

[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.820]
Somebody was in here dealing with our phone.

[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:34.480]

[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:35.900]
Wait a minute.

[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.560]
That's another reason, by the way, that we can't be letting anybody

[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.460]
else in here in the afternoon to get in these studio.

[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.420]
I don't want anybody else ever in here again.

[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.520]
That door, there's lock.

[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.220]
We'll remain locked.

[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.920]
They've got to do production in a toilet.

[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.000]
Let him do it in the ben Victory.

[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:47.880]
I'm sorry, let me go ahead, sweetheart.

[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:48.400]
Okay.

[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.180]
The NRA adopted 365 calling out for under their Rocklast site.

[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.340]
You put a spin on the tragedy in Colorado.

[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.860]
You son of a bitch.

[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:56.300]
You know.

[00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:02.400]
They felt that the reason that it happened is because the kids are raised with no moral values.

[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.380]
Only the gun lovers have moral values.

[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.880]
They blame Hollywood, they blame the video games.

[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:17.840]
And good old Alignor, he started to hear by saying there were 20,000 gun laws on the books and not one of them stopped what happened out there.

[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.680]
So why don't we just give everybody guns?

[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.380]
I mean if that's the logic, let's just give everybody a whole bunch of guns. It'll probably work out okay?

[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.300]
Right, seven of them.

[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.220]
You're not a problem in America?

[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:34.160]
Senator Lottonberg from New Jersey was on there as the anti-gun lobby, I guess you could call him.

[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:44.180]
And Alignor, they were saying that the Brady Bill stopped 250,000 felons from getting gun permits and guns last year.

[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.880]
And the NRA's response, what are the felons still walking the street?

[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.360]
We need the government to enforce the laws more.

[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:58.540]
And I'm like, now wait a minute, I saw like NRA Republicans, they want less government and now they're saying that they want them to arrest all these people and throw them away for good.

[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:03.720]
Not all felons that are out there are bad people you serve. You're allowed to come back in the society.

[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:05.920]
So, and...

[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.240]
I got news for you, they could take...

[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:15.900]
If they took all the people in prison in jail on drug charges, if they took them out of jail, they could put all the scumbags away and keep them there for next 50 years.

[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.220]
Right, right. And it's a very end of the show.

[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.320]
You're putting a lot of the ones that are playing in the National Felom League, too, by the way.

[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:32.100]
I totally agree with you with that. At the very end of the segment, they were talking about how they need to restrip guns and make it harder for people to get.

[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:39.180]
And of course, they bring up the Second Amendment and Senator Lottonberg read it, word for word, how the cops are doing.

[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:44.700]
But you're not going to... You're never... It's like the abortion thing in these are the same people, it's the same mentality.

[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:50.580]
It's like arguing with a rock, don't you understand? It's as much a part of their body as the blood that's thrown through their veins.

[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:55.720]
I agree. It was just so fascinating because I've been waiting to hear what the NRA had to stay on this.

[00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:04.300]
This is total tragedy, it's a real shame. They're going to find out there was more involved in this than just a couple kids going out the blow them away, you know, their friends the way or whatever it was.

[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.720]
Maybe, maybe not. Who knows, I don't know. Maybe they will or maybe they won't.

[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.120]
We might never know what really happened, but it was just so funny. Now they're going to...

[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:17.740]
You have to wonder again, we haven't heard a damn thing except for the heartfelt messages from the parents of these two scumbags.

[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:23.880]
We haven't heard anything else about them or who they were or where they were when these kids were making their 30 explosive devices.

[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:24.360]
Right.

[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:36.040]
While they thought witnesses said they heard them exploding them off through the weekend, then they were in the house and all this was going on and they have a feeling that they were in there making all this stuff.

[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:41.940]
But I don't think the two of them did alone. They found too many explosions devices around that place. They could not have done that all by themselves.

[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:46.480]
No, I guess they could. They asked one of the so-called experts this morning, one of the police people. They could have made them.

[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.560]
I mean, you don't have no idea what the timeframe was. How long they were planning this.

[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:58.420]
That is true, you don't know. But yeah, the NRA put the spin on it that it wasn't the gun laws and nothing like that. It was just their new borrower.

[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:04.440]
You got it. It'll borrower on the home on your. So all you've done, love them, people out there, you know, sleep with your guns tonight, whatever.

[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.680]
They'll be squeezing them. Hopefully.

[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.060]
You got it. I'll see you.

[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:07.220]
Bye.

[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:12.280]
Oh, thank God our phone is working again now. Every day we got to go through like some little kind of stuff in here.

[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:18.800]
Okay. By the way, the thank you for the fact that this is the, this is a chronic thanks to by the way, but nevertheless, thank you anyway.

[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:27.440]
The basketball diaries with the movie that kid with a trench coat goes in. You know that movie and blows everybody away into clans. It blows a bunch of kids away basketball diary.

[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:33.600]
It was. It wasn't. I saw that movie. I don't remember that happening. They showed the seniors today.

[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:43.320]
All of them. Maybe I slept to that part. There's a Leo movie was crappy. There's a scene where a kid goes in with a trench coat and shotgun wearing black and blows kids away.

[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:51.360]
They showed the clip. Yeah, one of the Tuesday night. All right. I'll take it work for it. I kind of have what it has. You know, one on one with Robbie Benson.

[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:58.800]
That's the only basketball movie you ever said. I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't see it. The baskets fall by reason. I'm going to go see that. No.

[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:05.520]
No. So I'm assuming that this is right because I'm sure it is because they they showed it. Here's a mobile and blood bell. Glade. Hello.

[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:13.920]
Hi. How are you doing? Okay, sir. I just called because yesterday I caught a show and I got up for work on this lady to the teacher at the school.

[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:22.540]
And she was like pleading that this could never happen to her school. God, they were the sacred school. I don't think no because it was a why?

[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:30.560]
Because she had the safest school that school that she was teaching that was the safest school. And you know, she didn't think that would ever happen.

[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:37.620]
No one would think it would ever happen in the school. But today you take out the corporate punishment in the school and you know, you're loved with that.

[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:44.540]
And what are a bunch of pucks coming to school wearing black trench coats and sunglasses? By the way, all through class every what is that?

[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.580]
Nothing. Just a statement that they're trying to make.

[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:56.100]
What statement is the school system now trying to make when they let kids do whatever they want?

[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:16.660]
They're not making money. You know, they're taking a side of a politician that's out there because as soon as you stop parents from being parents at home, because you're going to call HRist or if I'm taking a discipline my child, I mean, you have no, you're taking the right side of parents' hands.

[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:24.740]
And then you don't want to deal with the child. You know, everybody has to wear the parents wear the parents. Well, you know, sometimes it has a tie.

[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:25.500]
Yeah.

[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.300]
Who's hands are tied?

[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:35.440]
The parents hands because I think the people in the parents hands are tied. Maybe they're tied behind their back is the problem.

[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:46.220]
Okay, sir. Parents hands are tied. The school teachers hands are tied by the parents. Don't ever touch my kid. Don't ever accuse my kid of doing anything wrong by the parents who are mostly scumbags parents of these kids.

[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:51.120]
Not always mostly though. Sometimes you got some good parents who just love that just are totally oblivious.

[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:56.700]
Tried their best, but generally speaking in this country, one of the one of our biggest pastimes is trash making babies.

[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.500]
Otherwise, the jury's fingers should be off the year tomorrow.

[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.540]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:12.280]
That's right. Man, the NRA people in the gun thing. Don't you understand? Can't I draw you a map? Can I get, can I explain it to you?

[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:19.500]
Guns are as American as apple pie and Chevrolet and hot dogs and baseball and beer and you name it.

[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:28.420]
It's firmly ingrained. It's in there. It's deeply embedded since the days of the wild west that they don't want to let it go.

[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:37.840]
They have more excuses. You can't reason with maniacs. You can't reason with them because there is nothing there that will ever permeate that thick skull of theirs.

[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:45.580]
Nobody's going to take away their gun. And I'm not, we're not just talking handguns. You name it. You're going to have an arsenal as many as you want. Whatever you want.

[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.400]
That's what the Bill of Rights says. I'm going to have my gun because I don't trust that government.

[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:58.980]
And by the way, generally, politically, these are the people aligned with the far right wing who are the people in government that we should be trusting the least, by the way.

[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.180]
So maybe it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:14.140]
Of course, this is Robert. I'm playing in out of town all the time on business. Whatever I was looking for a good sports talk radio station and having to find the Rogers.

[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:24.240]
Being honest with you, it's very pathetic. And this guy, I mean, if this is all you got in the sports talk radio, it is horrible.

[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:32.320]
So I definitely try to find somebody better than for sure. And his whole GD thing and everything else, just telling one day we all face the Lord.

[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.140]
All right. Have a great day.

[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:34.700]
Bye.

[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:42.240]
210 years ago this March, astronomer William Hershel discovered the planet Uranus.

[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:53.880]
To commemorate this historic event, your public library is proud to present a special salute to Uranus, complete with books and magazines to help you study Uranus.

[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.560]
And the special display that allows you to examine Uranus more closely.

[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:08.540]
Brackum, why after one visit you'll be able to find Uranus with both hands tied behind your back. So stop by your library and discover Uranus today.

[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:17.700]
1045 at 560 WDQ and by the way, speaking of Uranus, this fits right in NRA scales back its convention. How do you like that? They had a scale it back like I said.

[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:31.040]
I met a growing backlash against guns following the little Colorado School massacre, the National Rifle Association yesterday began scaling back its annual convention, which was to begin next week in Denver, just a few miles away from the side of the killings, the shootings.

[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:39.140]
A spokeswoman who declined to identify herself confirmed that the centerpiece of the conference and elaborate exhibition at the city's convention center would be closed.

[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:44.600]
Meetings are to be held as scheduled NRA spokesman Bill Powers did not return messages yesterday.

[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:51.360]
The event had been expected to draw more than 22,000 hunters, shooters, collectors, and others from Colorado in the Texas Panhandle.

[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:58.920]
But yesterday the powerful lobby representing nearly three million lunatic gun owners began taking down billboards with pictures of NRA President Charlton Heston.

[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:04.800]
Along major roadways throughout the state and quietly informed its members of plans to scale back the event.

[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:12.300]
Ted Pasco, executive director of the Colorado Coalition Against the Gun Violence, a group of about 30 organizations applauded the decision.

[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:18.780]
We believe that in light of this horrible tragedy, the NRA should demonstrate some sensitivity to the families of the shooting victims, he said.

[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:25.260]
The decision appeared to be, a last-minute bid to avert what could have been a major public-reate relations crisis for the NRA.

[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.760]
And that amazing gun lobbyist have a public relations thing they got to worry about.

[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.680]
As in how embarrassing do they have to look before we realize how crazy they are.

[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:41.540]
As recently as Tuesday, Mr. Powers insisted that the organization wouldn't cancel the gathering, saying there's no way to do that.

[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:48.840]
He had had hundreds of thousands of dollars have already been spent and that the Denver Convention has been in the works for more than five years for Christ's sake.

[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:57.880]
Before the Colorado shootings on Tuesday, the NRA had identified Colorado as a state where it's still a good chance of winning loser regulations on guns.

[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:06.740]
Oh boy, winning loser regulations on guns, including proposed legislation that would have made it easier for gun owners to get permits that allow them to carry concealed weapons.

[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:13.620]
All right. No, they don't want to be able to protect yourself and your family and your home.

[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.420]
No, what they want you to be able to do is have all the guns you want anywhere and everywhere.

[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:23.420]
Let's just shoot it out, baby. In the parking lot. At school, anywhere you want.

[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.880]
Crazy people is what we're talking about. Gun huggers.

[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:35.240]
And it's such a phallic thing. I mean, anybody who doesn't realize that. These are old smoothies. These NRA guys.

[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:40.180]
I bet you, I bet you even would just a cursory examination you'd find out that Charlton has the news.

[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.840]
Doesn't have anything even closely resembling a penis. I guarantee you that. That's why he's hugging that gun.

[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.000]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello?

[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:57.240]
Yeah, Neil, I'm a little insulted as a parent. Everybody's blaming everything.

[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:04.440]
Rosie O'Donnell was blaming Jerry Springer yesterday. Everybody's blaming the guns. But nobody's coming back to the parent.

[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:09.720]
To the parental responsibility that I have to my kid to show him what right or what's wrong.

[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.420]
You know, I'm not a gun. I'm not four guns, right?

[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:19.120]
Let me ask you this. Sir, sir, my cliché, old friend. Let me ask you this.

[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:25.000]
If you got bad kids, they'll know the difference from right or wrong. Doesn't it make sense that they shouldn't have any access to guns?

[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.540]
Well, besides that, is that a stuffy one?

[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.900]
Sir, you're not even having to conversation, you're just screaming.

[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:38.520]
No, but the kids were looking at that crap on the internet. They were watching. I heard it with the Stephen King book. I just heard from you.

[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.520]
You just got through the crying, the people who are blaming everything else. And now you're doing it.

[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:52.260]
What should we do in front of it? What should have been done is that the parent should have been curtailing what their kids were seeing or anything like that.

[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.560]
Sir, let me ask you this. Sir, let me ask you this.

[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:59.740]
No, you can't ask me anything until you have stifled your lip and let's have a conversation. Otherwise, you're gone, okay?

[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.480]
Okay. Because you're a rude jackass. Okay.

[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:09.800]
Now, how about the kids that pick up daddy's gun? And you know, every day in this town, practically, there's another horror story.

[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:18.440]
And we see people crying on your television sets on the evening news because kids found daddy's gun that was sitting out on a lock or a shotgun or whatever was usually a handgun.

[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:22.980]
And somebody gets killed. Them, their playmates, their brother, whoever was. What about that?

[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:30.180]
Okay. Well, I agree. But also the parental responsibility to keep those guns locked up and keep the child safe to lock on them.

[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.940]
And are they doing it? Are they doing it, sir?

[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.700]
I don't know. I love coming in.

[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:39.440]
Okay. Well, when you find out, call me back. When you find something else. When you know something, my concerned parent friend. He don't know.

[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:50.460]
Like I said yesterday, we're just picking up just where we left off. It's like I told you. It's a hopeless argument. You're you're you're you're you're you're betting your head against the wall. I'm not going to do it. There's no point to it.

[00:36:52.800 --> 00:37:03.540]
Yeah, parents should be responsible. But you know something. There were a lot of parents who aren't. There were a lot of parents who are scum reproducing making babies. I know it may come as a shock to you, sir. It's not a big magic trick. Happens all the time.

[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:07.780]
In fact, a lot of time is the worst the scum we're talking about. The more babies they be making. Okay.

[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:16.240]
But don't confuse this guy with the facts that when you got a lot of little kids out there who are let come from families like that.

[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:27.460]
Who haven't been taught the difference between right and wrong. At least let's make sure that they don't have bombs that they don't have guns. They don't have hand grenades. Let's do the best we can to make sure that that's not possible.

[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:35.560]
But oh God forbid we should do that because then any starts with the cliche. I should why did I let him go beyond that guns don't kill people. Okay.

[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:46.880]
Soon as I hear the guns don't. That's like saying nuclear weapons don't kill people crazy governments kill people with nuclear weapons.

[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.480]
So why do we why do we want to do it with nuclear weapons for Christ's you know why should we want to do that.

[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:58.540]
I mean already got to do is read your newspaper today that they're still a little bit concerned about Russia the why two K problem.

[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:04.940]
I mean it's say I was six seven eight months away whatever it is now but they're not so sure about those nuclear warheads that got over there.

[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:13.220]
And the why two K problem is a little bit of concern like maybe we ought to send some people over there with a IQ larger than their thumbnail and help work that problem out for them.

[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:21.380]
Just so we don't blow the world up when we change the data on the calendar and then all the all the lunatics will be saying oh we told you armageddon's coming.

[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:29.620]
Told you so here's a candle hello the world will be a much better place if everyone had a gun you know that.

[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:36.560]
Oh yeah right but listen I'll change it to change the topic what a great game going to have time huh the Maple Leafs and the flyers.

[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:55.940]
Yeah five six seven oh five sixty call up a lot of the sports are a lot of hockey experts on this station okay you know what you know about the Maple Leafs and the flyers put together so you wouldn't know maple syrup or pantomime is stuck it inside your back home okay five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line these last couple days even though I didn't watch you some hockey last night with the alligator arms.

[00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:14.760]
I mean I just for some reason I have less patience than usual for the sports nerds you know just it's just not on my mind is that amazing Colorado they cancel it they moved the games the first two games of the series from Denver out to San Jose they rearranged that whole series the cancel the nuggets game the cancel two Colorado Rockies baseball games and like I said if it would have been the time of the year when the

[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:20.660]
Denver Broncos would have been playing you know the National Felomly they would have had to go on with it because well you know it's more important than life.

[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:29.880]
I'm just I'm just not thinking too much about ball games right now you know especially when I beat for about these gun huggers these crazy gun people.

[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:40.240]
We're helping to destroy this country and making it into a slaughterhouse where every single day somebody in this country picks up a gun I'm not talking about the scumbags that are out there so hold some pretty

[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:45.240]
issue I'm talking about innocent the kids and others oops sorry all too late now.

[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:55.660]
You need a driver's license to drive a car like I said I'll say it over and over again but to have a gun in the house all you got to do is be able to go out and buy one.

[00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:00.960]
That's all just have enough cash to buy one or maybe somebody to give you one.

[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:13.120]
But hey let's have make it easier to get concealed gun permits then we can all like hey you get pissed off over parking space in the you know any supermarket there you go at them all get out of that space mother reference.

[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:22.300]
Because we know that the American people are you know for real calm is not not a violent bunch of people for real calm rational reasonable.

[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:29.840]
Don't get psychotic over stuff it's like meaningless you know here's a mobile and color rich hello.

[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.580]
How are you okay sir.

[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:49.560]
Listen you know I agree with you I mean not to stir your rap but I'm a gun owner but I would if someone said tomorrow that there has to be you know a license for it and psychological testing and range testing I would be all for it.

[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.680]
Raise raise the age.

[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.020]
Well I mean if you think the NRA would be all for that.

[00:40:53.660 --> 00:41:00.980]
I don't care I don't give a crap I mean you know I don't give a crap I mean it's it's it's a responsibility I take very seriously.

[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:06.980]
But the thing is this I think I also think it's way too easy it is way too easy.

[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:14.160]
Another thing I wanted to say I'm driving down the pometta day first time I've been in that area and I had to pull off the side of the road.

[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.540]
Whoever put up the billboard for sunny hurts I mean they're a mention I mean I had to stop at the spot.

[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:29.620]
Yeah I take a glance I don't only see the guy in you know in little black and white photos sometimes in the paper and the IOD thing but you know it's nice to see his face I don't know if you you're aware of that.

[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.140]
Yeah something called about yesterday it was a nice touch.

[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:36.280]
Yeah it was very nice you know I mean God bless sunny hurts you know.

[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.320]
Okay and God bless you Neil.

[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.200]
And have a great day.

[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.400]
And don't sneeze again.

[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:44.520]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:52.240]
I mean that this is one of the reasons that I gave up doing that kind of talk years ago because I arguing these things with people who are boneheads.

[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:57.140]
I mean it's like a religion thing I just do that because it agitates a lot of people and because somebody needs to say it.

[00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.040]
Somebody needs to say the truth.

[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:05.000]
But arguing guns in America it's like it's like saying well that's that's ban professional sports.

[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:05.740]
Yeah right.

[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:05.740]

[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:12.440]
Let's not let's make it illegal to fire off firecrackers on the 4th of July huh.

[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.020]
I think that's ever going to happen.

[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:14.260]
No.

[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.300]
That may be the end of the 4th of July.

[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:16.560]
No.

[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.500]
Let's make it illegal to drink beer on the holidays you know.

[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:19.760]
No.

[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.720]
Let's here's a mobile in South Miami.

[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.040]
Hello.

[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.440]
Yeah it was going on.

[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.080]
How you doing sir?

[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:26.860]
A couple things.

[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.220]
I think that movie for somewhere somebody said something about movie called Heather's.

[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.200]
I haven't seen it.

[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.880]
But somebody said a movie called Heather's that might have been something.

[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.020]
No it was the basketball diary.

[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.680]
I'm sure it was a dream sequence.

[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.000]
He was having a fantasy scene.

[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:39.740]
Oh fantasy scene.

[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.360]
He was the nevertheless that's what they showed us.

[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.360]
You know, people on the French code were always clashed.

[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.160]
Corrections are one of the Howard Piles I call this.

[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.660]
The Howard is not anti-gun.

[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.200]
Howard has a few guns.

[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.100]
And at the time, a forever becomes on the show and he doesn't have to go.

[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.040]
You need to know all the guns.

[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.740]
Don't you get a predict yourself this and that would ever.

[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.020]
And to us today of course that's the best.

[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:57.780]
I don't get listened.

[00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.300]
I don't listen to somebody because they agree with all my opinions.

[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.640]
That's his business whether he has a gun or not if he's responsible with it.

[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:05.500]
I don't have a problem with that.

[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:09.180]
But the pull the stun that he had this guy do on a day one.

[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.220]
Just think of yourself as a parent.

[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.080]
You're sitting there, you're terrified.

[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.040]
You're scared, crapless.

[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:18.440]
Or think of yourself as one of the kids in the school who's watching, who's hiding and cowering.

[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.440]
And watching they had a TV set in every room.

[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.320]
They had one kid call from inside the school.

[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.900]
And they inject this in the middle of it.

[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.420]
Like there's something funny about this.

[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:28.240]
Yeah, I understand.

[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.300]
What up?

[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.920]
I would say that George is going to start with their how it is daughter there.

[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.140]
I wonder if funny would be if they were playing the same kind of you know.

[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.680]
If they played that call in the year then the letter is over here.

[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.220]
I don't know if funny is daughter would think it's me.

[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:43.280]
But I'm sure they cleaned that part up and they wouldn't let her let her hear that part.

[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:43.820]
Okay.

[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.360]
Okay, a good request.

[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:46.380]
What's your joint?

[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:46.940]
Okay.

[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:47.540]
Thanks.

[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.780]
What's going to happen with that radio drop in your opinion?

[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:51.980]
Oh, the radio.

[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.940]
Yeah, the radio played by play now.

[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:59.280]
I think obviously Goldie based on his pensioning performance has got to be considered.

[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.300]
Is a serious candidate.

[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:05.220]
One thing about Steve Goldstein, I think you'll agree with the Joe, you don't better than anybody in all seriousness.

[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:09.820]
I respect the work that Steve Goldstein puts in.

[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.580]
Be it preparing for a Panther radio broadcast.

[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:19.040]
I've had the fortune of working with Joe at QA or not with Joe but with Goldie at QAAM.

[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.220]
And Joe, I think that Goldie is a hard worker and I really respect that.

[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.040]
And I think he's got to be considered the next.

[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.340]
Well, you have been strong.

[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:26.860]
How do you go, Ram?

[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.360]
You have bastard, he's who got it.

[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.340]
You have that bit of death.

[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.680]
And you know, when that's what you said, I don't buy it.

[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:32.640]
I don't buy it.

[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.140]
I find that.

[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:33.720]
You got it.

[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.120]
You get the who we're out the moon, man.

[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:37.020]
And I'm for the sake.

[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:37.820]
And I'm for the sake.

[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:38.620]
And I'm for the sake.

[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:38.920]
Oh.

[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.240]
So you're asking me, oh, why does he do that?

[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.300]
It's just his nature.

[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:48.360]
It's like a leech that attaches, not Brian leech, a leech that attaches itself to your like shoulder, your neck.

[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:49.600]
It's his nature.

[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.700]
Like a vampire.

[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:52.820]
Like Bella Logosi.

[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:53.940]
Why does he suck blood?

[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.380]
It's in his nature.

[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.440]
It's his way.

[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.000]
It's his thing.

[00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.080]
And remember, his thing is being an askissor.

[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.520]
Good guy, but a real askissor.

[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.120]
How about tomorrow night?

[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.660]
56670560, 0560 on the 18t.

[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:11.900]
Oh, it was just a joke.

[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.100]
As he turns red in the face, it was just a joke.

[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:14.720]
Oh, yeah, right.

[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.480]
Here's a lady, mobile and candle.

[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:17.780]
Hello.

[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.200]
Yeah, hi.

[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:19.760]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:21.260]
I'm doing great.

[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.620]
I totally agree with you, Neil.

[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:26.220]
Well, this is becoming the Wild Wild West all over again.

[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.320]
Everybody wants to have a gun.

[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:30.700]
Everybody wants to use it at the spur of the moment.

[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:37.860]
And nobody's being responsible for these kids, for these guns that they're, they can get faster than an easier, that they can get drunk.

[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:42.200]
And God forbid, anyway, she'd talk about that because then we get all the, you know, the gun lovers out.

[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.720]
We get the all the cliches like that jackass parent before.

[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:46.300]
Oh, guns don't kill people.

[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:47.580]
There's a guy.

[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:48.720]
I can't think for himself.

[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.680]
All he is is mind is filled with cliches that somebody else he've been there.

[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.760]
He's scary as a parent.

[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.100]
I mean, I hate to see how he treats his kids.

[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.560]
But in any case, my husband and I are avid hunters.

[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:03.880]
We hunt the 34 month a year that it's a lot here in Florida.

[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.140]
We got to say, go to Texas.

[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:06.580]
And we're not parents.

[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.460]
And we have a big guy at the time.

[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.900]
Well, what are the high huffa Texans?

[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.480]
We hunt goose, quail, ducks.

[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:13.220]
Yeah.

[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.160]
Beer.

[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:19.240]
And you know, you're having big things at the house and all our children's

[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:19.540]
children's family.

[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:20.420]
Yes.

[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.480]
Oh, sorry, man.

[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:22.840]
You're going to be bound.

[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:23.300]
He's gone.

[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.620]
It's hanging on my wall.

[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:25.500]
Poor family.

[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.000]
But in any case, we are responsible hunters.

[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.300]
All our hunting equipment is locked in a big safe, that even I fit in it.

[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.960]
And you know, these parents want to be protected.

[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.680]
They're saying, case somebody breaks in, and case something happens.

[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.040]
95% of the time, the gun is not used for anything.

[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.340]
But you know, kids trying to be curious.

[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.680]
You're not going to catch a burglar in your house.

[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.360]
Very rare to be found in that kind of environment.

[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:47.960]
Well, let me ask you this.

[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.760]
What kind of an imbecile?

[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:54.640]
Say, I mean, if you're that kind of a person that leaves guns in any kind of a place in a drawer

[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.040]
unlocked, unsecured somehow, that your kids can get a hold of it.

[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.060]
What kind of a person does that?

[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.980]
How irresponsible can that person possibly be?

[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.760]
And how could that person have had the right to somehow reproduce?

[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:06.340]
I thought this.

[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:08.840]
They have that kind of a problem.

[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.020]
Those people ought to be castrated immediately just to make sure they don't make any mistakes.

[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:12.460]
I think that they would have been more babies.

[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:18.660]
Yeah, I think we'll be done all of a sudden yesterday that mothers should get together,

[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:24.940]
everybody should get together against the NCAA and put a lot tougher regulations on guns,

[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.600]
especially handguns, and things are easily accessible.

[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.460]
Now, was that before after she said that was the jury's springersfall?

[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:32.600]
Well, no.

[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.620]
That was flying off that edge there.

[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.260]
Irracional effected by the Irracional effected.

[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:42.340]
Yeah, but I believe we've all stand up against it.

[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:45.880]
The other side of it is that we all need to watch each other's kids.

[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:50.820]
Their parents are just too busy and unfortunately both parents have to work nowadays to support the family.

[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:54.200]
And we're not sometimes taking care of our kids and looking after them.

[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:59.640]
And as neighbors, as parents, as cousins, we have the responsibility to watch over somebody else's kid

[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.940]
if we see some weird behavior.

[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.840]
So we all need to pay attention to everybody's children.

[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.800]
I mean, hearing that all these children were going off in the neighborhood with these two kids,

[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:06.620]
what do they think it was?

[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.340]
The fourth of July, like it was practice, or something?

[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.900]
Yeah, honestly, how can nobody notice that these kids had a problem?

[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.980]
I mean, the head on a wet thought, you know, Hitler's birthday, something wrote testicles going to happen.

[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:19.240]
They threatened the one kid they were going to kill him last year and nobody did anything about that.

[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.080]
They did everything that put up a billboard saying,

[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.680]
guess what? We're going to do something really wrote test.

[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:23.960]
And everybody said, yeah, okay.

[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:27.540]
Yeah, there were so many signs and I can't believe nobody cared.

[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:27.900]

[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.280]
And it's everybody's responsibility.

[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:30.300]
Okay.

[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.360]
Say how to say how to pambi.

[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:33.040]
Okay.

[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:33.960]
Bye-bye.

[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:37.280]
Just before he takes his last breath, oh, I'm sorry, bambi.

[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:38.660]
Poor bambi.

[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:39.040]
Oh, he's dead.

[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:39.320]
Okay.

[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:41.940]
5670560, pont 560.

[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.640]
I mean, how can people shoot a deer?

[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.860]
And then they come on, oh yeah, why do you know the overpopulation problem?

[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:47.960]
We're doing them a favor.

[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:52.720]
They have the overpopulation problem in China, too, that we go over and shoot them all?

[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.540]
I'm not going to tell you what George said.

[00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:58.720]
Okay, I won't repeat it.

[00:48:58.860 --> 00:48:59.480]
What George said.

[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.880]
I'll just pretend I didn't hear it through the glass.

[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:03.940]
I heard it.

[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.880]
Okay, let's go to Miami.

[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:06.220]
Hello.

[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.460]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:08.000]
Okay, sir.

[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:16.080]
I agree that a big part of the problem is guns, but I think the bigger part of the problem is that these kids have access to a mainstream education.

[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.220]
What does that mean?

[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.200]
Well, it's a mainstream education.

[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:24.940]
The two kids in Colorado were arrested or they broke into a car.

[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:28.260]
Once you do something like that, stick them in a special school.

[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.840]
Don't let them in a school with normal, well-abiding kids.

[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:35.120]
So in other words, they could have killed some kids in a special school, without what you're saying?

[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:42.840]
What I'm saying is, like the kid in Kentucky brought a gun to school one time, and they let him back in the school serving his kids.

[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:43.940]
Sir, you're absolutely correct.

[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.880]
You should never have been let back in the school, and in a million years, you're right.

[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:50.600]
And if you put these kids in the school, he should have been put in a juvenile hall somewhere.

[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:51.080]
You're right.

[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:56.380]
And if they put these kids in a school with each other, they just kill themselves, left jail space, we need 20 years from now.

[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:57.260]
Okay, great. Thanks.

[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.160]
See? Well, I said before he, that's why he got to it.

[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.400]
Yeah, put them in a school with other punks, so you know, they broke into a car.

[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:07.620]
They deserve to be shot, right?

[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:08.020]
No.

[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:08.840]

[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.740]
Gains simplistic, ridiculous. Why are we doing this?

[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.700]
Why am I doing this to myself again today?

[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:17.600]
I wouldn't even brought this up other than from that facts from this John guy.

[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:24.400]
About all, if you woke up with a big black guy, with a black ski man, I see that you know, you're, you're, you're whiteed out the, you're whiteed out.

[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:25.920]
And part of that expression.

[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.220]
I mean, if it was a white guy, with a black ski man, it's going to be a six inch knife.

[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:31.360]
I wouldn't be concerned about that.

[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:34.120]
What's that?

[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.000]
It's the first time I ever saw a mirror in my hand, you know, I think it wasn't a check.

[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:37.780]
What is that?

[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.560]
A flexible spending account benefit thing.

[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:45.740]
Oh, by the way, George is getting this 200 bucks, I'm playing the monthly on his check this week.

[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.300]
Oh, I got it. I already got it.

[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.080]
I think I got it.

[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.640]
Did Bluff get his death net?

[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:49.940]
No.

[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:50.720]
No. No.

[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.380]
Okay, whoever's got George in the office pool, you win.

[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:58.120]
If you bet on dust desk, well, you lose.

[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.380]
But he's got that two little hightcher in there.

[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.660]
Get down on your hand and ease and lick my boots.

[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:05.060]
No.

[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.060]
She R E C T I O N.

[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.760]
If the wreck doesn't die.

[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:11.540]
Oh, right.

[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.560]
I'm gonna kick off my shoes, drip off my dress.

[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:18.020]
It makes me wet when I see you, Dad.

[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:18.500]
Yes.

[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.340]
A big, big wreck, duh.

[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:21.880]
Yeah.

[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.700]
That's too big for a lie, Dad.

[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:28.040]
I want it mercenary and a top of you.

[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:31.420]
And take it up my lubricated hoops, dude.

[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.500]
Give me an air breakdown.

[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:35.260]
No.

[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.360]
Nails to the wall.

[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:41.480]
R E C T I O N.

[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:44.000]
I want a drink, your ball.

[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:48.000]
I want to laugh while he out here when he's too sturdy.

[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.120]
And then I'll give it a blow.

[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.220]
He's a warning-ish-it.

[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:54.760]
And big-ass-it.

[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.160]
That creeps-sun till you take up his.

[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.060]
I want a wreck on his surround.

[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:01.580]
You're closing to.

[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.940]
And make your wonderworm explode with glue.

[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.380]
That's a miracle.

[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.760]
And his son, Sir, comes by.

[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.940]
He R E C T I O N.

[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.440]
I want a drink, your ball.

[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:20.080]
Maybe he's watching.

[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:20.980]
Tony Shale's watching.

[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:21.640]
I don't think so.

[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.060]
But Jeff is not over there to pizza lot.

[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.560]
And the day where we need lots and lots of pizzas for our friend,

[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:26.320]
because they are daughters.

[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:27.760]
It's bringing your daughter to work day.

[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:28.740]
And Sabrina's here.

[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.200]
And Jeff, uh, uh, a high daughter is here.

[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:33.320]
And Greg reads-

[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.460]
I just moved right along.

[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:35.660]
Greg reads daughter is here.

[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:36.500]
Don't start with Jeff.

[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.940]
I'm making noises about him and all that stuff.

[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.900]
And about how his daughter put on that bratty act over there at Paxton.

[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.340]
And about all that other stuff you always talk about.

[00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:46.800]
Same old stories, even though they're true, but nevertheless.

[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:49.120]
So we got to add dilemma there.

[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:50.100]
What are we going to do about that?

[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:51.820]
I can't give Jeff a little bit more time.

[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:52.480]
To a call.

[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.200]
He might be listening to the whole thing.

[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:55.040]
Yeah, we'll give Jeff a lot of five minutes to call us in.

[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:56.840]
If he might be listening now or somebody get a hold of ponytail.

[00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:00.200]
And if not, we're going to have to get a whole bunch of pizzas from someplace else.

[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.200]
Let's try his mobile phone.

[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:02.020]
It didn't work.

[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.160]
Maybe he's at the gym again.

[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:04.240]
Maybe he's over to Jeff Rimmers.

[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:06.900]
Maybe he took Jeff out to lunch.

[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.080]
You know, he said, how about tomorrow?

[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.320]
Alcohol, things in town.

[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.800]
You know, maybe they're out, uh, yeah.

[00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:13.000]
Doing that.

[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:13.880]
Together.

[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.000]
Here's the fact that's kind of interesting.

[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.300]
He says, I think it's interesting that all the gun huggers in religion is to Zimada

[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:19.620]
Facts.

[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.340]
Most right wingers need to refer to anecdotes in order to prove their alleged point.

[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.820]
Such as the fact you received would say if somebody busted your home of three amitsetorin

[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:28.360]
So on, wouldn't you wish you had a gun then?

[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.720]
Or if you knew you were dying in a Mr. Ratio accept Jesus, et cetera, and so on.

[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.800]
They need to fall back on the anecdotes because they have no facts.

[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.300]
It's a matter of fact, all the facts are against them.

[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:37.900]
Yes, sir, right?

[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:38.600]
And it goes on and on.

[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:39.600]
Yes, sir, you're right.

[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.760]
But don't confuse them with the facts because they don't want to hear from the facts.

[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:44.020]
They don't know from the facts.

[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.320]
Another facts.

[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.480]
56670560, pond 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:51.840]
Here's a mobile in Weston.

[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:52.060]
Hello.

[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.000]
Yes, good morning, Neil.

[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:54.440]
Yes, sir.

[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:55.240]
How are you doing?

[00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:55.800]
Okay.

[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:56.360]
Good.

[00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:02.720]
My call earlier the week and explained to you briefly how idiotic some of these callers are

[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:03.520]
that call in here.

[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:04.460]
And that last call.

[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:05.560]
You don't have to explain that to me.

[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:07.440]
Yeah, that was a perfect example of the last call.

[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.900]
I know a good call from a bad call.

[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.220]
I'm still waiting for a good call.

[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.800]
Well, here's a good call for you.

[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:14.960]
The reason, let me address this.

[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.360]
How do you today, I mean, period, go ahead.

[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:23.600]
This issue with the guns and the kids, I really think the main problem with this.

[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.240]
And there's so many different problems.

[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:31.220]
What the main problem with this is the families of today don't communicate with their kids anymore.

[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.940]
They're parents, if they have to work, they don't have a relationship with their parents,

[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:36.920]
their grandparents.

[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.640]
You know, my parents had a part of my life.

[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:44.120]
Everything that I did, my parents had a part of my life.

[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:50.300]
I couldn't go into my basement if I had one and sneak 30 bombs down there and make them.

[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:55.000]
Without my parents knowing anything about it, I couldn't let alone sneak a girl in my room for 10 minutes.

[00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:00.360]
You know, but the problem with this is there's no commitment.

[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.580]
There's no communication with families anymore.

[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:06.640]
In regards to the handguns, there's no way you're going to ever eliminate them.

[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:10.360]
It'd be a help if they passed laws to help it out a little.

[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:16.120]
But, you know, the most secure place, supposedly, in the U.S. nowadays, is our jail system, supposedly.

[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:22.660]
Okay? And they're able to sneak things in, guns, knives, form gangs, whatever you want to call it.

[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.860]
They're able to do it in there.

[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:26.720]
So there's no way to ever eliminate any of that kind of stuff.

[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.520]
But, you know, passing laws will help.

[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:32.340]
It starts in the families and the religion, whatever religion it is.

[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:33.900]
They need to be involved in as well.

[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:35.920]
No, religions really do a great job on them.

[00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:41.740]
Well, I'm not saying they are, but I think it helps to form some kind of base there.

[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:45.080]
Not only with the family, but with your religion, whatever religion they be.

[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.700]
I couldn't disagree with you more.

[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:49.600]
I don't think that religions have anything to do with knowing that you don't choose people.

[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:50.880]
It's just plain common sense.

[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:52.320]
It's just common decency.

[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:55.920]
All the brainwashing, all the religious bull crap doesn't change anybody.

[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:57.420]
No, it doesn't.

[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:57.880]
It doesn't.

[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.420]
And, you know, I don't even have kids yet, Neil.

[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:03.120]
And I don't know what I'm going to do when I do.

[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:04.160]
It's really a shame.

[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:04.780]
Okay.

[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.060]
But thank you, Apple.

[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:06.420]
Good day.

[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:07.420]
See you at the passport office.

[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:11.660]
56070560.560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.700]
Here's Hollywood. Hello.

[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:16.060]
Good morning.

[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:16.580]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.940]
First of all, I want to let you know I don't know on the gun and I agree with you 100%.

[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.720]
But who is going to stop this?

[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:27.060]
If our government steps in and puts the stock to this, they'll do a good job as they did with the drug situation.

[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.540]
We're in FESTA with that.

[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.940]
They do a good job when they try to stop alcohol.

[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:32.360]
They start a prohibition.

[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:36.380]
I think that if they stop the guns, what they're going to do is create a major black market.

[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:39.000]
Which is going to be very likely we don't already have one.

[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.400]
We're ever going to have one.

[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:41.540]
It'll be worse.

[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:42.640]
Neil, it'll be worse.

[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:43.240]
You don't know.

[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.400]
I don't think you can eliminate all this crap.

[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.440]
I never said we ought to eliminate all this crap.

[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.160]
What I did say is that people have to be responsible with them.

[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:54.180]
And if they're not, they're going to have to be a telecomable for whatever happens.

[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:57.900]
If you buy a gun and you leave it out and your kid blows his brains out or somebody else,

[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.860]
you're going to have to be held accountable for it.

[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:03.740]
I'm trying to figure out how all these intercity kids have all these guns available.

[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.560]
Like down here, while we've tried by shootings and crap like that.

[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:08.820]
And Oozies, they're not getting them from their parents.

[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:09.580]
Oozies?

[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:12.120]
I don't understand where these are coming from.

[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.260]
So I think it's going to be probably where.

[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:15.860]
I think our country is too far gone already.

[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:16.720]
It's really a shame.

[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.260]
And I'm well full glad my daughter is at a school already.

[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:20.980]
It's getting worse and worse and worse.

[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.020]
We're in a step forward.

[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.380]
I don't know what the hell is going to happen here.

[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:24.540]
OK, I'll see you on the plane.

[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.980]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:32.220]
Here's a mobile in Boca. Hello.

[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:33.940]
Hey, and how you doing?

[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:34.540]
OK, sir.

[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:36.720]
I got a novel idea here.

[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:41.180]
According to the Constitution, we have the rights of bear arms.

[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:44.560]
Nothing says in the Constitution, you have the rights of bear bullets.

[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:46.360]
So they restrict the sale.

[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:47.840]
OK, great. Bullards guns are there.

[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:50.180]
There's a gun. Don't kill people. Bullards kill people.

[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:51.900]
Right. That's a good point.

[00:57:55.420 --> 00:58:00.200]
Oh, boy. He's got a point.

[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.440]
You know, he's got a real point.

[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:02.440]
How old point?

[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:06.640]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:07.940]
Let's go out and kill some deer.

[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:09.140]
Come on. Let's shoot, Bambi.

[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:12.280]
Have some fun. Let's go out and shoot some deer.

[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:16.360]
I'm surprised. You know, I'm surprised Santa Claus can still get around.

[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:18.140]
I'm surprised somebody ain't shot those reindeer yet.

[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:20.100]
You know what? That poor Rudolph.

[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:22.440]
I wonder he keeps kissing so much noise.

[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.380]
I wonder if it's brood off the brown nose reindeer now.

[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:25.820]
Maybe that's a rumors thing, you know?

[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.300]
Maybe he learned from Rudolph.

[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.820]
If you just kiss enough cottage cheese,

[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.180]
that adds you'll be safe all the time.

[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:32.540]
Maybe that's what that's all about.

[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.960]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:42.020]
Guns don't kill people. Bullards kill people.

[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.920]
Excellent, sir. Not bad.

[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:44.980]
I like it.

[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.540]
There's nothing there. It says we have to have loaded guns.

[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.080]
You can have guns, even though it says we have a well-regulated militia.

[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:51.640]
But you can have guns just no bullets.

[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:54.720]
I like it.

[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:56.700]
Here's Bokeh. Hello.

[00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:57.640]
Hello, dear.

[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:58.160]
Yes, sir.

[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:01.100]
Listen, I own guns, okay?

[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:03.600]
I've been 100% agreement with you now.

[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:04.200]
Okay.

[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.440]
I used to be a member of the NRA.

[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:06.940]
Okay.

[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:08.660]
I'm not a member of the NRA anymore.

[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:09.620]
Yeah. Why is that?

[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.920]
Well, a couple of years ago,

[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.480]
when they came out with a Brady Bill,

[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.840]
the NRA turned around and they were just flat out against it.

[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:17.920]
Right.

[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:22.460]
Now, I agree that it's kind of a feel-good law.

[00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:24.840]
But if it would save just one or two lives,

[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:25.640]
hey, why not?

[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:27.380]
The law-abiding citizen,

[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:29.440]
they shouldn't have a problem with the Brady Bill.

[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.020]
I don't have a problem with it.

[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:35.260]
Another thing was, if you remember Bob Dole,

[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:39.140]
if it was, he was pushing for, what was it?

[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:41.540]
He didn't want plastic guns or something, right?

[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:43.680]
And he was with the NRA, I mean,

[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:44.480]
that's right.

[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.480]
He said that plastic guns should be allowed.

[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.640]
Why would you want a plastic gun, right?

[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.560]
So somebody would end to interview Bob Dole

[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.140]
and they snuck in a plastic gun.

[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:55.940]
And he pulled it out and he was like,

[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:58.080]
see, I could get this in there without the metal detectors.

[00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.000]
And Bob Dole, you know, he was all I rate and stuff.

[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:04.120]
But the NRA came out and they were like, well,

[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.260]
you can't restrict plastic guns, you know?

[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.720]
They were a fanatical society, basically.

[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.700]
They're gun lovers.

[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.060]
They don't really, I mean, that's a lie.

[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.640]
But they don't want any restrictions on guns here.

[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:14.080]
So they don't.

[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:17.400]
Everybody could like, you have a holster on your hip, you know?

[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:20.400]
And just like the old Wild West, that's what they want.

[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.080]
But see, I agree with you 100% that if you do own guns,

[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.140]
you have to have them locked up and you have to take responsibility.

[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:28.080]
But they don't.

[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.080]
Let me say it again.

[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.960]
This is like a dog chasing its tail.

[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:34.680]
The American public collectively are not responsible enough

[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.140]
to be trusted with guns.

[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.080]
They just can't do it.

[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.220]
Yeah, well, you know, you have so many of that.

[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.520]
I mean, I learned like I said yesterday,

[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.640]
well, you give the keys to a car to a 60-year-old kid.

[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:45.580]
Of course not.

[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:48.440]
And that's what they've done with the guns in the hands of these American people.

[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.000]
They're lunatics. They're irresponsible.

[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.260]
You know, I'm all for, like I said, you know,

[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.360]
there's got to be some kind of testing or anything for, you know,

[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:57.340]
because these people, they don't have a felony,

[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:58.240]
but they'll go out.

[01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.900]
And first of all, they shouldn't even have kids.

[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.540]
But they have guns sitting in the house with the kids.

[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:03.020]
Yeah.

[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:05.280]
And the kids won't go ahead and get a hold of it, you know?

[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:08.680]
And every single day, every week of your life,

[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:12.500]
there are kids killing themselves with each other with daddy's gun or somebody's gun

[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.720]
that was laying around.

[01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:14.420]
Every day.

[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:15.540]
You have to say to yourself,

[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.860]
these people shouldn't be parents because I have a two-year-old daughter

[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:21.040]
and I wouldn't want her to stick her hand in a light socket.

[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.080]
So I put things there so they protect it.

[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:26.300]
Well, I sure it's had care enough about them not to leave a loaded gun around.

[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.340]
But these people, they just don't think about it.

[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.780]
So first of all, they shouldn't even be parents.

[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.800]
They're not responsible enough to have it.

[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.900]
So definitely they're not responsible enough to have guns.

[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.760]
So believe me, not all gun owners disagree with you.

[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:37.080]
Okay.

[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:37.520]
Okay.

[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:37.980]
I have a good one.

[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.280]
You know, Rosie or Donald may have had a bit of a point, even though she didn't realize it.

[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:44.180]
I think what we know how we solve this, part of the problem,

[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.580]
we go around surreptitiously, you know, knocking on people's doors

[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.940]
and if they're watching Jerry Springer,

[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.560]
immediate forced sterilization right on the spot.

[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:54.740]
Huh?

[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.560]
That would solve a lot of the problem.

[01:01:58.760 --> 01:01:59.680]
No questions asked.

[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:01.200]
You know, we have like a little team of doctors.

[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:02.220]
Okay, come on in, guys.

[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:02.840]
Here we go.

[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.560]
So, snip.

[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:07.440]
Here's a mobile on the alley.

[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:07.700]
Hello.

[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:09.560]
Hello, Neil.

[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:10.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:10.900]
Hi.

[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.420]
First time I'm calling to love your show.

[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:13.940]
Uh-huh.

[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:20.480]
My point on gun is we're afraid to educate our children on curiosity.

[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.680]
I mean, kids are going and getting these guns because they're curious.

[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.540]
If we go ahead and educate our kids on what the danger of gun is,

[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:32.560]
and those gun pairs that do own guns take to get up to the range

[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.840]
and show them what their are capable of,

[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.400]
I think will eliminate that curiosity for them.

[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:37.780]

[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:43.820]
Number two, I think that the government knows that we're all bunch of lunatics.

[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.540]
And I personally think that we don't put,

[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:52.000]
there are emphasized more restrictions on guns because it's more of that's like population control.

[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:55.580]
It is.

[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:56.280]
Yeah.

[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.380]
Yeah, you guys look at this way.

[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.760]
All guns were eliminated.

[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:03.720]
Our blacks were really killed off blacks, the whites were really killed off whites, you know.

[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.080]
Yeah.

[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.360]
We'd be all populated.

[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.460]
Well, maybe that's an idea.

[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.700]
If we got neighborhoods that are overpopulated,

[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:13.500]
maybe the government can just go in and hand out guns.

[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.120]
That's not the problem pretty fast.

[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.740]
Oh, maybe it's not so much hand out guns, but...

[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:18.520]
Yeah, hand them out.

[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:21.180]
That would be such a bad idea.

[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:21.880]
Okay, thanks.

[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:22.580]
There you go.

[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:24.280]
But that's going to solve our overpopulation problem.

[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:28.320]
It's a lot easier than tell people to stop making so many babies and they don't think it's like plant parenthood,

[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:31.400]
which just the sound of that sounds like a commie pinco conspiracy to me, right?

[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.100]
Isn't that a commie pinco?

[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:33.560]
Oh, yeah.

[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:34.500]
Plant parenthood.

[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.300]
The feeding message was furnished by the NFS.

[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.080]
National felonly.

[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:41.400]
Thank you.

[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:42.840]
It's 1131 at 560.

[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.100]
We got Hank Goldberg at 2.

[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:45.220]
We got Kimberbolt Camp over at 6.

[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.680]
And Kaplan at 10 o'clock.

[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.740]
We odds on things that haven't been invented yet.

[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.840]
So we're getting food from my Arnold.

[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:51.640]
Is that what it is?

[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.700]
Because when we tried ponytail, but again, you have two days in a row.

[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.280]
You're right.

[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.840]
That would be a little bit too much pressure on him.

[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.140]
Great guy, by the way, Jeff Cohen.

[01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.640]
Got some wild stories he'll tell you.

[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:00.860]
If you promise not to repeat them.

[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:03.400]
Here's a Delray Beach.

[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:03.560]
Hello.

[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:04.820]
Hey, Neil.

[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:05.620]
How you doing?

[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:06.220]
Okay, sir.

[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.600]
Listen, I got two reasons.

[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:10.080]
Number one, I'm sick of these hunting people.

[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.760]
There's no reason to be hunting.

[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.560]
This is 1990.

[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.420]
Yeah, but Bambi needs some attention.

[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:15.320]
You need hunting.

[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.040]
You go crossbow bow and arrow.

[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:20.100]
There's no reason to have a rifle that can shoot from 300 yards.

[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:21.440]
You know what I mean?

[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:22.340]
It's ridiculous.

[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.600]
There's no reason for that.

[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.600]
And another quick statement is wing.

[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:28.780]
They don't want to shoot them from 300 yards.

[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.700]
What would your crossbow?

[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.160]
What do you do?

[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.020]
Like 50 feet away?

[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.160]
Yeah, well, whatever.

[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:35.820]
Even if you use a crossbow, look close and look at me.

[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:36.800]
I think there's one for you.

[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:37.440]
Yeah.

[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.700]
I mean, there's no reason to have guns.

[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:40.940]
They really isn't.

[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:41.200]
Yeah.

[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.240]
Another thing is when you're playing.

[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.260]
There's no reason to have bombs.

[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.240]
There's no question to have guns.

[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.880]
But that's the human F and race for you, man.

[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:47.760]
That's the way we are.

[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:48.720]
Exactly.

[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:49.620]
I'm talking about things.

[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:53.060]
You know, the hunting excuse is just washed out.

[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:53.940]
It's just ridiculous.

[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:55.600]
Okay.

[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.320]
I got a statement for wing.

[01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:57.920]
Yes, sir.

[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:02.660]
Another thing is when he made that press conference when he said that he would not play if they built

[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.140]
them an arena in Broward.

[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:04.520]
Right.

[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:05.860]
When he didn't write so far.

[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:06.660]
He would never lie.

[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:08.220]
Okay.

[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.160]
Thank you.

[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:12.600]
Oh, there's the call of the year right there.

[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.320]
Excellent point.

[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:16.120]
They will not play there.

[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.420]
Maybe that's the reason because they haven't played a lick in that arena.

[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:20.740]
And I'm going to tell you something right now and you can mark it down.

[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:21.120]
Okay.

[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.560]
If Broward County would change their mind and decided they wanted to build this facility.

[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:24.880]
Yeah.

[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:26.080]
I will not play here.

[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:27.040]
You can't do a team I guess.

[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:33.500]
Because I will not have you guys looking at me for the next 10 years saying here's the guy that said one thing and went out and did something else.

[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:33.860]
Okay.

[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.060]
So I guess we're screwed for like at least another nine years anyway.

[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.500]
Then we can say it.

[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:41.620]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.740]
That must be a John Hennesse daughter.

[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:44.740]
How much said John?

[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.500]
5, 1, say that.

[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.100]
How are you doing sweetheart?

[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.100]
And there's Carlos and there's everybody.

[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.320]
We got the whole so what's the deal we got food coming in here or what?

[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:52.920]
About 40 minutes.

[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:58.240]
40 minutes we got way our old coming in left here but it makes me very sad because it makes me think that we won't be seeing our good friend Murray.

[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.100]
You think he's in heaven now?

[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.040]
He's in that fast food restaurant in the sky.

[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.200]
Number in Faso.

[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:08.760]
He's in heaven now.

[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:15.500]
I wasn't in a panel case the nephew who was in the panel case of it.

[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.080]
I'm not talking about Murray Jesus.

[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.120]
I mean I'm not going to go into it.

[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.380]
I'm not going to go into that again because then that guy will call again.

[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.520]
You're promoting your anti-religion agenda.

[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.820]
I got so many agendas man.

[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.020]
I better hurry up and talk fast.

[01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:29.280]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:29.520]
Hello.

[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:31.320]
Hello Neil.

[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:31.760]
Yes sir.

[01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:32.520]
Yes sir.

[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:35.120]
I read this for students in Carole.

[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.140]
The morning for coming in with French codes.

[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:38.600]
Like French codes.

[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:40.640]
Coming in where?

[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.500]
At the white school near Denver.

[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.020]
At what high school near Denver?

[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.200]
The high school is closed sir.

[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:47.600]
Good luck.

[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:50.440]
56670560.

[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.020]
Pound 560 on the AT and Bobbibui by the way.

[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:54.620]
Here's a mobile in North Miami.

[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:54.920]
Hello.

[01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:56.020]
How's the meal?

[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:56.480]
How you doing?

[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.100]
Okay sir.

[01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:57.700]
Good.

[01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:01.040]
I wanted to go back to a caller that called like I guess about 5 or 6 calls ago.

[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.460]
And he made the statement.

[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.540]
He'd like to know where people in the inner city and all of these people are getting guns and who these from.

[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.960]
Does he live on another planet?

[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:10.360]
Yes.

[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.480]
He must because you've talked about it.

[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.800]
It's been in the papers millions of times.

[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.040]
Yeah.

[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:19.120]
That what these guns come from are the gun shows.

[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.880]
You don't have to go through a background check.

[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:22.120]
Yeah.

[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.240]
Or the lock in with your cash money.

[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:24.620]
Right.

[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.900]
You can pick up anything under the sun.

[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.720]
I wouldn't be surprised.

[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:33.440]
Probably by the end of the year we probably be able to buy our own nuclear weapons right over the internet.

[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:35.020]
Okay sir.

[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:35.500]
There he goes.

[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.740]
He's a little worked up and rightfully so you know those gun shows you know.

[01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:44.420]
Like I said they run those spots on the show for those gun shows and I want to make sure you understand I have no control over that whatsoever.

[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:51.280]
And I've always made very very clear that I find the whole concept of that crap.

[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.300]
But nevertheless, you know the gun lover's got to have some outlets somewhere.

[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:55.740]
5, 6, 7.

[01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:01.100]
And I noticed by the way Ken Jenny while you're busy busting the swing clubs and everything else where somebody might be touching itself.

[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:02.440]
You know the gun clubs.

[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:03.540]
Yes they don't bother you.

[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.220]
Okay the gun shows.

[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:10.640]
Because guns are good although I wait till he finds out they were phallic symbol and he might get really pissed off about that.

[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:12.360]
He might get porced off about it.

[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.100]
Fascist sure of Ken Jenny.

[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:18.160]
Oh what a what a loser he turned out to be huh?

[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.320]
It's amazing you know before they get in there it's like God or one thing like Alex penis.

[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.960]
He's got to make sure Mickey Harrison don't get a free ride.

[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:26.740]
We're not going to do that.

[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.620]
And then all of a sudden he gets elected and by the big he makes a quick right turn at the pass.

[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.640]
Well you know he's paying for the arena yet.

[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:38.500]
For the building of the arena who's going to pay for it for the next hundred years huh?

[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:41.180]
Here's the lady in Aventura.

[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:41.460]
Hello?

[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.620]
Oh this phone is the look at that.

[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.440]
Four times I had to put my finger on it and the phone too.

[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:49.600]
Here's the lady in Aventura.

[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:49.900]
Hello?

[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:50.560]
Good morning.

[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:51.140]
How are you doing?

[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:51.440]
Okay.

[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.940]
I feel two key words are role models.

[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.920]
I feel in my day our parents were...

[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.160]
You mean my Cecil Collins yeah?

[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:02.100]
We're examples of what to follow.

[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.700]
Today the parents don't they drink.

[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:05.980]
They take drugs.

[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:08.000]
They don't too busy for their children.

[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:09.440]
You have your athletes.

[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:11.480]
You can't even look up to your athletes.

[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.700]
Dennis Rodman, Darrell Strawberry.

[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.760]
How about the one that choked his coach?

[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:19.780]
You move these stores in my day if they had an affair or something.

[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:20.980]
They were out of Hollywood.

[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:23.180]
What's this with all the...

[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.800]
Shall we say a fatherless children that big?

[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:26.740]
That's American.

[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:27.660]
That's what I'm telling you.

[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.480]
The priorities of this country are upside down.

[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:32.740]
The so-called sports fans of America that go back to the latrine,

[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:33.660]
the spree wells of the world.

[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.700]
We had a guy called in yesterday admitted because he signed with a nix

[01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:39.340]
which he just got for its fine 25 grand for opening his mouth

[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:41.420]
and make it stupid comments about wanting to be traded.

[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.200]
But nevertheless he went to his team

[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.560]
to all the Sunday roots for him.

[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.600]
See, I can't buy that.

[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:48.120]
And my ring scum, you're right.

[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.080]
And my ring scum, it filters down to the kids.

[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:52.040]
What kind of a message does that send to the kids?

[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:52.720]
You can't eat.

[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:53.760]
The scum bag is a good thing.

[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.700]
You can't even look up to the preaches.

[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.360]
All the ones that have been arrested.

[01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.660]
How about even...

[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.700]
There's a random answer you can't look up to.

[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:02.000]
Who?

[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.840]
The president you can't look up to.

[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:04.540]
What will happen?

[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:05.980]
Well, depends on where you're laying at the time.

[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.640]
I said it depends on what position you're in at the time.

[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:09.400]
You're right.

[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:10.420]
You can look up to him.

[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:11.260]
You're right.

[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.360]
But it happens to be standing.

[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:16.840]
And really, and I think the way the children dress today in school

[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.060]
has a lot to do with their attitude also.

[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.820]
I think uniforms is a good thing.

[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:21.640]
Oh, no.

[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:22.480]
No uniforms.

[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:23.200]
I'm sorry.

[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:24.380]
We've part company on that.

[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:24.920]
No uniforms.

[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:28.840]
It brings up those images of the little brown shirts in Germany to Hitler.

[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:29.280]
You...

[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.700]
I don't think you're going to get that.

[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:32.900]
It's because you put somebody in a certain kind of clothing.

[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:34.940]
It doesn't change what time you got.

[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:35.280]
How about a dress coat?

[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:36.580]
How about a dress coat?

[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:37.800]
How about a dress coat?

[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:37.840]

[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:38.660]
I agree with that then.

[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:42.160]
I still want to know how come a bunch of punks in black trench coats

[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.800]
were allowed to come to school every day.

[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.060]
Well, I don't think that...

[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:45.900]
What kind of school is that?

[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:49.780]
I don't think that city payed it or a night my heart goes out to that family.

[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:51.280]
Please don't judge me on that.

[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.560]
But I don't think the families paid attention.

[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.940]
Perhaps the families of these children...

[01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:57.020]
Well, somebody had their head in the ground.

[01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:58.580]
Somebody was doing the ostrich routine.

[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.140]
Well, what about their families?

[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.600]
Are they neo-nazis?

[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.280]
If they allowed their children to have swastikas in their room?

[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:04.980]
You will find out.

[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:07.260]
I think it's very scary.

[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:10.900]
We're number one in murderous country in the world.

[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:11.420]
Right.

[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:12.940]
And we're the richest country in the world.

[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.240]
What about a number one in something?

[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:16.600]
We're number one in something!

[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:17.540]
Have a great day this week.

[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.100]
In a two day.

[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:18.600]
Bye-bye.

[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.420]
We're number one, Goddammit.

[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.160]
And if it only happens to be murdering each other,

[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.380]
why do you have to be number one in something?

[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:23.660]
Right?

[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:24.100]
There you go.

[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.600]
The media is sick and needs help, Dadland.

[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.740]
Here.

[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:39.740]

[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:40.840]
Here.

[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.560]
We call Beckland to throw them to south.

[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:46.880]
We died on deep-fried fire now.

[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:51.260]
We loved to flee the dirt in the campaign.

[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:56.540]
We prayed a lot in church.

[01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:59.920]
On my foot to next the smudge.

[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:05.720]
And then bought only new goods at the spray hall.

[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:10.360]
I just held this on a sack.

[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.680]
He hates the nice guy cut the slack.

[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:18.220]
And from the Joneses I knew poster games.

[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:23.020]
We saw the help of the bum.

[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:26.460]
All the staff at 100 clubs.

[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:32.160]
And I think that that's the chair that was his name.

[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:32.700]
Yes.

[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:34.460]
We ran away right.

[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.700]
And need a chance.

[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:42.140]
We find a poster clinic.

[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:45.380]
And we've lost the toll.

[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.820]
We're mostly white.

[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:51.140]
And sperm retention.

[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.820]
Here's our thing.

[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:55.180]
There you did.

[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:55.920]
I'm caught.

[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.920]
We ran away right.

[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.800]
We all look and read the same.

[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:08.520]
And hate the game.

[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.100]
And she's the same.

[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:14.240]
And fear the things that we don't understand.

[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:19.280]
Richard Nixon was like us.

[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:21.120]
Well, his face grew.

[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:21.120]

[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.700]
And he was like a star of the buzz.

[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:28.020]
So I think we also give our big a hand.

[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:33.100]
96 will be in swing.

[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:36.260]
And beat the dims like a rock making.

[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:41.060]
Well, don't the red and blue just keep the white.

[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:45.380]
A little boss that I straight.

[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:48.820]
Just don't let this near your place.

[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:54.120]
And hope there's no more books for him to cry.

[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:57.200]
We ran away.

[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.520]
And need a chance.

[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:04.780]
We find a poster clinic.

[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.880]
And we've lost the toll.

[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:08.760]
Are you?

[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.500]
We're mostly white.

[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.640]
And sperm retention.

[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:13.840]
The two of us are in the red and blue.

[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:13.840]

[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:17.900]
Here's what I think that you did.

[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:18.640]
I'm caught.

[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:20.400]
We're mainly in the winter rides.

[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.600]
That's the beginning of the hit.

[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:28.820]
12.47 at 5.60 WQAM on a really bizarre Thursday.

[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:29.540]
That's all I can say.

[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:30.080]
It's bizarre.

[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:32.900]
I'm just feeling bizarre.

[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:35.020]

nerds how many people listening to this radio station during the sports

[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.820]
hours could really give a flying craft if the guy that minnesota Vikings

[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:57.820]
or the chicago bears got a uh... you know uh... free safety if they got a uh...

[01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:58.260]
whatever they got

[01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:03.700]
how many but we're narrowing it down to a precious few it's a miracle we get

[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.100]
the numbers we do on the station

[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.520]
because they let these colors call in with such narrow narrow like uh... who cares

[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.360]
those guys play here anywhere around here

[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.240]

[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.080]
job and you're here's a mobile in the gable so long

[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:53.640]
you know this or hey um for these people that believe that this can't happen in

[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:58.420]
their school i'm sure you remember that believe that that these shootings won't

[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:02.120]
happen in the school believe that now at this point now that we know can happen

[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:06.100]
people that says well that's they're just isolated incidents you go look here

[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:09.760]
and i'm not only did it happen in the school but they were able somehow to plant

[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.560]
these thirty explosive devices in the parking lot and most of them inside the

[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:17.540]
school how are they able to do that what were they doing like in their after hours

[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:21.840]
how did they do this lack of lack of supervision somebody wasn't paying any

[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.760]
attention but what i was going to tell you that you remember back in eighty

[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:30.300]
six they had a shootout of panels park high school and that's where i went to

[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:34.160]
school i was there at the time i can imagine what these kids are going through

[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:37.620]
i was on the other side of the concourse when some kid because he got an

[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:42.100]
f blew away the dean blew away a cap terrier worker shot a human resource

[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:48.140]
officer and one of the two students and uh... you know and i still think about

[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:52.160]
that even now when every time i see one of these things i just cringe kids with guns

[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.400]
kids with guns i mean can you can you think of anything scarier in the world and kids

[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:59.720]
with guns that maybe kids with nuclear weapons which probably won't be far off

[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:04.100]
well i can tell you what also is just as bad i'm from uh... arkinson virginia

[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.820]
and uh... up there believe her not they were they are they wonder why because

[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:13.700]
actually petition the state legislatures guilty use eight people to seven four

[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:15.180]
deer hunting and animal hunting

[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:19.060]
yeah i didn't need that kind of firepower

[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:20.560]
how about an uzi

[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.940]
that's probably the next step i don't want to just won't be leaving line there

[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:27.840]
bleeding that that would be cool and unusual punched in relation to the dead

[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:31.260]
in the door now i guess they just want to uh... blow away the rest of the

[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.260]
years all that's left is the antlers there you go well hey they make nice

[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:36.440]

with a fish hook

[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:02.000]

shooting little defensive defensive animal like it they say defensive

[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.940]
defenseless little animals beautiful animals like that shooting

[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:35.060]
putting out of their misery because they're overpopulating

[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:38.420]
well they're overpopulating all over the world so we go around shoot them too

[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:40.540]
somebody always suggested that

[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:45.400]
how about we stop the overpopulating the poverty pissed off but other than that

[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.580]
see a one thing you fail to understand that nobody wants to talk about

[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:51.840]
is this is a country i you can remember used to be a hundred million people all

[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.420]
of a sudden i can remember the world used to be less than two billion people

[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.700]
now there's five billion it's teeming with people

[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:59.500]
and it's country that used to be a hundred million that's two hundred and sixty

[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:02.340]
million people it won't be long before three hundred million people

[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:07.600]
lots and lots more people lots and lots more problems no resources no time no

[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.260]
interest no energy to take care of people into problems and we look at these

[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:13.380]
things so now we got like teeming people and so i mean it's just a numbers game

[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:17.000]
if you have a billion people there's going to be some crazy people is going to be

[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.860]
some dangerous people but she's can't just keep reproducing like rabbits

[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.200]
you and all the screw-colds that are in groups about the company

[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:20.440]
and you must and you write it on this and stamp out this awful assessment of arguing

[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:26.760]
you can do it by bringing about compulsory education on the subject of my ethics in general

[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:32.960]
but bright water water he's particular because it is only through enlightenment

[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:37.900]
but this scourge can be what's up after the traffic in really is growing

[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:43.380]
a long as most of the people scarcely estimate as grown and is now publishing

[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:48.260]
it exists in almost every city and family in the country

[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:53.000]
i've received a letter of life-oring importance from a member of the narcotics guru

[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:59.240]
i'm going to read this letter to you my idea doctor cattle the suppression of reuse of

[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:04.000]
marijuana and the process working behind it are the most important job is the

[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.100]
department is now engaged in the weed marijuana is growing every stake in the union

[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:16.000]
the driverism there is are ground up and made in the cigarettes by a simple hand machine

[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:23.280]
the deadly narcotic is rather quickly and easily prepared for its market the sale of marijuana

[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:28.900]
is even more difficult to detect and hold when the traffic in drugs such as propium

[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:37.820]
morphine and heroin or and more vicious more deadly even on these so-called destroying drugs

[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:44.820]
is the limits of marijuana no doubt many of you do not believe the things do happen

[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:50.520]

[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:13.720]
one of the solutions of the problem i think mr. heston did you hear what he had to say on the radio

[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:19.800]
today mr. heston oh yeah he was saying how to lose visually fascist you think that the school should

[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:26.560]
have armed security guards now right and and he's right how about if every teacher is armed that would be

[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.860]
good well the other thing is i can't how about i got news for let me ask you something because i'm

[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:33.880]
mentioned about how at the first time i went to roll myself the soldier standing in the middle of the

[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:38.340]
robe with an uzi on his shoulder how about if we had an armed guard in every classroom standing

[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:43.660]
right there with an uzi that's what it sounds like yeah what i mean what i can't understand in this

[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:49.680]
panel where it happens yes i mean these people the law enforcement the educators the guidance

[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:55.620]
counselor yeah they almost been on another star trek world or something i mean it just seems like how

[01:29:55.620 --> 01:30:00.500]
how could they not have maybe there were listening to too much oblivious newton john music that

[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:05.400]
needed in the problem i think they just seem so clue they just seem like they had too many signs

[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:10.020]
too many times you gotta understand they're 1800 kids in that school so like i said before when

[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:14.880]
you're dealing with the vast massive numbers game we are in america today everybody's just another

[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:19.060]
number whether it's at the bank at school wherever it is everybody's just another number well i

[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:25.720]
think that we should like spend our money on the old the sick and and on the young okay all right

[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:30.880]
buddy okay and i'm getting there fast and i don't mean young five six seven oh five sixty pound five

[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.240]
sixty on the mobile one line no i mean they got important stuff there like when Andrew

[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:39.420]
Kahnanem came down here you know before he shot Gianni Versailles right there in the head and also

[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:44.980]
got that dove at the same time and they only goes into the pawn shop takes out his passport gives him

[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:49.280]
his real name he signs his real name gives him the address at the enormity hotel where he's staying at

[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:53.380]
and uh... you know the thing goes to the police that sits there under the i mean i realized now they've

[01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:58.840]
changed that because it was bad publicity for that to get out just kind of sat around for a few days

[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:05.620]
till they had around it to kind of looking at those things all these things just we're just overwhelmed

[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:11.840]
we're overwhelmed it's a numbers game too many crazy people too many uh babies too many crazy babies

[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:17.140]
to uh... you know that's it that's what america's all about just spawn out of control

[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:22.340]
and maybe that's why human life is so meaningless because we got so many more i mean you know if they

[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:27.140]
kill a bunch of kids there's always a bunch more come along here's a mobile in pember pine hello

[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:32.460]
hey how you doing me okay listen you know guns are already out of control and you know you were

[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:36.680]
kidding when you said up you know sooner the teachers are gonna have to start carrying guns

[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:39.780]
and i think that would be a deterrent yeah right away

[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:43.220]

Try again.

[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:51.840]
95.

[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:52.660]
Try again.

[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:53.560]
102.

[01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:54.500]
Close.

[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:55.200]
One more year.

[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:56.380]
103.

[01:38:58.240 --> 01:38:58.960]
Absolutely correct.

[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:00.800]
I just pulled that out of my ass.

[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:01.140]
Really?

[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:02.100]
Just in your went of his.

[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:02.400]
Yeah.

[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:03.940]
And he didn't even have any puppets.

[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.580]
He just had his hand with a blonde wig on it and some lipstick on his, you know, in the box.

[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:08.740]
And the box, yes.

[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:10.820]
I said, I said, I said, I said, yeah.

[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:12.540]
He was great.

[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:13.580]
I'm thinking, to be clear.

[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:15.280]
He was great.

[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:15.460]
Great.

[01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:18.240]
And the best part of it is, his lips were really pretty.

[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.260]
He was just moved and he didn't care.

[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.980]
He saw him doing a thing and nobody cared.

[01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:22.600]
He was great.

[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:25.940]
He was better than that neurotic Judy Garland as I recall.

[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.900]
I was a little kid when we went to New York to see that before.

[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:28.940]
He was fantastic.

[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:29.940]
Senior wences.

[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:31.400]
It's all right.

[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:31.920]
It's all right.

[01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:34.100]
He did.

[01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:35.900]
103, not bad.

[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:38.620]
567-0560.

[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:40.400]
Found five, 60 on the mobile one.

[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:40.940]
Hey, listen.

[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:42.400]
God, don't give us a whole bunch of years.

[01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:44.120]
You know, that God, that these people are all talking about.

[01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:46.480]
You got to do the best you can in a very limited amount of time.

[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:48.320]
Here's Miami.

[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:48.720]
Hello.

[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:49.680]
New.

[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:50.280]
Yes sir.

[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:50.860]
Okay.

[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:54.720]
I think I got the, I figured out why these transco-mouthy kids

[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:56.300]
started bucking shots at the teachers.

[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:56.860]
Uh-huh.

[01:39:57.340 --> 01:39:58.320]
The water was out.

[01:39:58.340 --> 01:39:58.880]
They weren't coming at the teachers.

[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:02.860]
There was only one teacher that got shot but then again, probably somebody had to read that to you in the newspaper.

[01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:05.020]
567-0560.

[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.760]
Found five, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:10.720]
Somebody went over to his house to read him the newspaper so we know what was going on.

[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:10.920]
No.

[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:11.440]
Okay.

[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:12.600]
I tried, pal.

[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:14.180]
Couldn't get him by any takers.

[01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:15.660]
Here's a mobile in four-later day.

[01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:23.140]
Hello, hello, Neil. Yes sir. Okay. I cannot phone you great my concentration is so many things you talk about all these things. Yeah

[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:26.300]
Hey, you know when I was growing up in high school

[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:28.380]
There was in a big high school

[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:34.440]
You knew just about everybody in the school. Yeah, somebody somebody was troubled everybody knew it

[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:39.520]
Mm-hmm. They stayed away from them. What you know, you're right with the numbers of people in these schools

[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:43.460]
There's got to be one crazy person in there 1800 kids in the school

[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:48.460]
There's got to be one crazy one in there. They were talking about some school in LA where they put in they put in

[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:53.640]
Middle-Eighteners, but they're having a problem because they got 4,000 kids go to that school and it takes like forever

[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:57.100]
Never so that they only can do random searches because they got 4,000

[01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:03.440]
Students in the school. Can you imagine? It's ridiculous. Yeah, that's why there's so much trouble and and then that's the

[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:08.360]
You know the parents the parents are so damn busy when the kids get home. They don't care anyway

[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:10.860]
They come home from work. They go to bed. They go to work

[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:15.700]
And I mean countries like China or Japan where the people are brought up would like a you know

[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:21.440]
It's very very strict morals and the very strict ideals and respect for human life and respect for other people

[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:25.700]
Then no matter how many people they have like when I had I don't know how many two billion people in China

[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:28.840]
It didn't make any difference because they all go step to the line

[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:31.300]
You know, but here we're not too good at getting people to go step in the line

[01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:32.860]
No, no big

[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:36.040]
So maybe we can put them all in uniforms and just have them go step in the line

[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:37.880]
It's crazy

[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:41.060]
Why not if they would be able to think about your will be wrong?

[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:45.980]
You're clear kid on the on the bus because he's doing something wrong again

[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:48.760]
Maybe things would change, but that's never gonna happen. No

[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:50.580]
American F and Wayman

[01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:55.060]
Yes, they're the slaughterhouse and it's appropriate that they're slaughtering the cattle because it is a slaughterhouse

[01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:58.260]
Okay, I have a hang in there pal. Okay. See you on a firing range

[01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:03.880]
Five sit what I'm supposed to correct myself. They don't use the bolt gun anymore because it shatters the skull

[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:06.220]
What do they do can't make head she's out of it then? Oh?

[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:14.460]
I don't want to see head she's much less here about it. So now they've got you tell me what's in head she's by the way

[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:18.500]
I don't I'm sorry asked now. What is it? What do they use they electrocute them now?

[01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:19.300]
With a what?

[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:21.420]
They're making a sit down in the chair

[01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:25.800]
So they have like a separate lecture free one and they put their little beanie on their head like they do on

[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:30.740]
That's right. They shave their heads and they put little beanie on there and they are cow goes

[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:35.600]
Oh, please read them the right. Yeah, does he say managed down a halala has that?

[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:37.380]
Yeah, oh

[01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:42.280]
Yeah, I think I'd talk about that before you're right, but I can't be one of those tree huggers

[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:48.620]
You know one of those vegetarians. I like my stick. I like my meat. I love my meat and a good stick ain't bad either

[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:54.920]
5 6 7 8 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on a mobile one line. I got a little carried away

[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:59.020]
Yeah, I get emotional when I think about all these things and why not?

[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.440]
Here's a mobile in South Miami. Hello

[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.300]
You know how you doing great

[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:09.020]
Two things I think it's amazing how everyone has a solution that is problem. Oh, they're all experts man

[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:11.520]
I come on yesterday. I said I don't have any answer. It's out of control

[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:14.100]
It's hopeless and these people everyone has got an answer

[01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:17.040]
Everyone we got to put a tank at every school this time

[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:21.500]
Yeah, and then there was a guy don't know if you saw CNBC last night on date line

[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:26.400]
I believe it was no, but it was they had an expert the guy is an expert in school security

[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.920]
Yeah, they go okay

[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:33.080]
So what do you think he goes well? We need metal detectors in every grammar school elementary school in high school

[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:36.060]
And then they proceeded to say this guy owns the company

[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:41.680]
That puts metal protection. Oh, what a surprise that is and like I said schools that have like 1800 kids like the school out there in

[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:44.480]
Little in Colorado or like the one in LA that's got 4,000 kids

[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:48.960]
What do they do get their three in the morning so that by 8 30 or nine when the first class starts everybody could be passed

[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:52.080]
Or the metal detector and then maybe get home by midnight? It was amazing

[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:57.340]
They go 18,000 for one unit and they cut back to this other guy and said the average high school in the United States

[01:43:57.340 --> 01:44:01.200]
It's a 62 to 88 doors on it. Yeah, so I mean

[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:05.080]
I mean no one knows if the problem is no easy solution

[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.240]
Okay, that have a great thing

[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:13.640]
There is of course there's no easy solution. That's out of control. It's on a hand

[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:18.000]
It's a barbaric country where the people unfortunately far too many of them don't have any values

[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.640]
They have no respect for human life and the rest of the public are sitting there

[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:22.940]
You know, you know what they're saying? Yeah

[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:28.920]
Yeah, cuz they're like a desensitized to it the grave robbing media has said oh, hey, here's another juicy story

[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:32.420]
You know, let's all start hyperventilating. It's just yeah, it's just another TV story

[01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:37.260]
It's got test and tragic and there's a lot of blood and it's real, but you know, it's real. They're really you know, and they're going

[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:38.940]
like that

[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:43.120]
But be that isn't me

[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:48.840]
Be that isn't me all but it's the movies and the TV shows and like I keep telling you all these European countries

[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:52.820]
I traveled through the very same movies and the very same TV shows they're all on there and nobody's killing

[01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:53.260]
each other

[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:57.900]
Wonder why that could be huh you think maybe those people might have respect for human life

[01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:00.460]
Uh-huh. Maybe they know a little bit better than your kids, you know, uh-huh

[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:03.460]
Maybe they've had a little bit better upbringing. That might just be it

[01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:09.360]
No, that couldn't be it huh could there possibly be somebody better than America?

[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:13.040]
I mean that guy that called before he was he was my favorite over the whole year so far

[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.220]
America's a great country and I said yeah, well, why?

[01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:18.360]
But be by the way by the end like that

[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:22.560]
I'll tell you one thing. It's a great day when Wayne Arles people show up. Thank you gentlemen

[01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:23.880]

[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:36.500]
So anyway, what are we doing 1226 at 560 at WKG?

I apologize to the lady who's dear hunting. I just I can't you know, I don't want to think about it

[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:50.840]
I know that you're not doing it because you're a mean nasty bitch and you want to go out there and shoot some defenseless beautiful little animal

[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:56.380]
But you know, Bandy was a very heart wrenching movie that I saw 100 years ago. What's it? No, okay?

[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:58.080]
Like I said have a good time

[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:03.880]
1226 at 560 WQA now it's a little squirrel. You don't want to share the squirrel

[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:09.060]
They can't eat a squirrel. They eat squirrel. No off that they're like loaded with rabbis and all kinds of diseases

[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:15.760]
Holy machinon. This is Joe Bo on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority

[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:19.540]
Neil God right tired of the same old flavors of yogurt

[01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:22.440]

Well look out taste buds prepare yourself palette for croutons trout on the bottom yogurt

Croutons new trout on the bottom yogurt combining to delicious attributes of yogurt with heartache chunks of rainbow trot

[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.780]
No frills no guilt

[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:49.240]
Great taste croutons try on the bottom yogurt regular and D.I. Okay, it's soft

[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:54.560]
31 at 560 WQA thanks to Hudson our buddies over Wayne Arles for bringing a great lunch for us and for all the

[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:58.140]
People in the building and the daughters that came in today like Sabrina and everybody else

[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:05.660]
I thought you were bringing something else in here. So anyway, well you never know okay

[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:07.120]
You know it never hurts to a wonder

[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:09.780]
But of course a lot of animals had to die to make our lunch today

[01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:14.160]
Let's have a couple of moments of silence for the animals that we don't want to have a new no okay, I'm sorry

[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.420]
567 on by the way, it says the Wayne says hello. He's been elected lieutenant governor of

[01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:20.860]
Kiwanis

[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:24.380]
You spoil it you supposed to say Florida and then I go no

[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:27.080]
Broward County no, no

[01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:29.340]
Kiwanis

[01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:30.900]
The politically a still Wayne Arnold

[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:36.120]
Who has the Ted Kennedy a picture on one window and a Jeb Boots picture on the other window?

[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:40.880]
No covering all sides they call it and when you're as big as when you can cover all sides just with your body

[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:43.780]
Nice going Wayne. He's the lieutenant governor of Kiwanis

[01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:46.480]
You probably look real cute with that Kiwanis cap on you know

[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:50.900]
567 O5 60 pound 560 on a mobile one line

[01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:52.380]
We're having a very educational day today

[01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:58.520]
We learned for the first time that it's the left wingers who are trying to censor everything you read and burn books and movies and everything else

[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:02.900]
It's the left wingers not the right wingers the left wingers are the ones who we're going to try to tell everybody how to live

[01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:08.600]
How about that the bedroom police the pleasure police those are the left wingers you believe that yeah, that's what the guy said

[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:18.580]
Yeah, a lot of poor animals had died a little piggy went to market these dead little look at us all these animals that had to die to make our lunch possible today Christ

[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.460]
Anybody ever have any good squirrel?

[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:28.520]
How come they don't eat squirrel because they're all rabbit is that it? I'm under a penny girl. They do eat squirrels too

[01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:34.140]
Do eat squirrel maybe that's why we traded this ass out of here. Well, he shouldn't do nothing

[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:41.400]
Here is a lady mobile in the keys. Hello, you know, I'm currently telling you and I know there are no solutions to everything

[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:45.140]
So I think the parents are really used to blame at this in a situation

[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:46.220]
maybe

[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:51.780]
You know, I just I don't understand how they were making all these bombs right there at a basement and

[01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:56.140]
Parents thought that they were had an erector set or something there. I don't know what they thought they were doing

[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:02.880]
Okay, your phone crap dot call me back sweetheart

[01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:04.880]
Your phone crap died

[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:10.540]
Prite of coming back five six seven oh five sixty pound by yummy. They were playing part cheesy down in a basement

[01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:13.680]
Maybe they were playing with each other which would have been an improvement by the way

[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:16.400]
Overbuilding a la bomba

[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:23.440]
There had to be an awful lot of people looking the other way nobody knew from nothing like I said when you got all these people

[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:28.760]
All these things all these problems you're overwhelmed you don't have the resources and of course by the way

[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:35.580]
It's also the right wingers who don't want to a lot of money to have resources for human needs God forbid you know, we take care of these things

[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:41.880]
They'd rather spend all that money and building more big bombs and more big weapons et cetera in the audio audio

[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:45.420]
Okay, for their military industrial complex for they're established now

[01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:51.300]
That's what they want to do more and more goddamn money for crap to kill people but not to take care of real living and breathing people

[01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:56.060]
All they care about as long as you take care of the fetus then we'll worry about it. They're living people later on

[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:59.120]
Here's Boka hello

[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:03.740]
Boka hello, yes, sir. Yeah, Boka

[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:08.140]
Speaking about who's this new that's last time I checked

[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:10.880]
Hello, who's this the caller

[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:15.120]
Let's go to Boka hello. Yeah, yes, sir

[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:18.880]
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about the

[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:26.560]
school after in Denver. Yes, I got a good plan for the funeral for the guys. Mm-hmm great

[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:32.700]
560 505 60 05 60 on a mobile one line. Did I cut that guy off?

[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:34.060]
Yeah, that's your sweet ass. I did

[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:39.600]
Of course if they had the fact that he was a little slow in the beginning should have tipped me off that I don't think so

[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:41.720]
Here's Pompano. Hello

[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:43.540]
Thank you. Yes, sir

[01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:48.820]
I when I was a kid I moved from one school to another from like the city to the suburbs and

[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:55.800]
They put me in like these AP classes because maybe my first original school might have been a little bit ahead of the one out in the

[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:57.540]
suburbs and

[01:50:57.540 --> 01:50:59.040]
They were these really nerdy kids

[01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:03.300]
In the AP classes and they happened to be really really nice kids

[01:51:03.300 --> 01:51:07.360]
I was doing a class this for about two years one of them probably had a play the guitar and other one

[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:12.540]
They just did they were just really wonderful people, but they looked kind of strange and nerdy

[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:19.100]
Okay now at when I left their classes and as we went to high school people ticked on these people I

[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:24.440]
Had to I had to step in like I had a couple fights when I moved from my first neighborhood to the

[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:29.200]
To the other neighborhood and I was so frightened to death somehow I won those fights

[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:33.480]
I don't know how but I was frightened to death and then people kind of accepted me

[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:38.940]
Like oh look there's a guy who could take care of himself. Well in the out I was really nervous to sell and and frightened

[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:42.040]
But these kids who I went to school with

[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:45.860]
It's like everybody was like looking to fight them

[01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:50.220]
I had to step in and stop fights once in a while they were they were getting beat up

[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:54.880]
Now these kids a lot of them you could tell they formed these little quick groups

[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:59.060]
They were owners and they were and and basically was because everybody's being mean to them

[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:03.940]
And I could see very easily nobody's addressing it that these kids

[01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:08.160]
If somebody's mean you then you ought to go on build a bunch of bombs and get some guns and blow their crap

[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:10.500]
Always that was your saying sir. No, no you shouldn't do that

[01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:14.920]
But I think what it does is it creates a little like a of these little groups of three they get weird

[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:17.120]
They they feel insecure

[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:20.680]
Yeah, and from feeling having such bad feelings

[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:23.840]
I think that these things are just in their head

[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:26.560]
Okay, thank you sir feelings

[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:29.340]
You got bad feelings

[01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:30.480]
I'm away, baby

[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:37.020]
That's good. You know, I think that's probably a sunset all up right here the following is a paid public service announcement from the International Ripeful Association

[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:41.740]
Let's face most of us will never be rich. Hell we probably won't even be successful

[01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:46.920]
And that's pretty damn depressing but as usual with every problem there is a solution

[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:50.460]
Hi, I'm Jim and I'm here to tell you a little something about handguns

[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:55.020]
They scare the **** out of people and intimidate them and giving you whatever you want

[01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:59.000]
That's right handguns think about it. Need some cash

[01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:05.020]
Don't have enough money for beer pull up the convenience takes chips and pretzels wire at it

[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:10.420]
It's all free if you got a handgun some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend kill him

[01:53:10.420 --> 01:53:17.240]
The simple solution of life's cop Lex props all I have to do is wait the five days for it and happiness is just around the corner

[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:19.920]
Well, if you don't want to wait the five days who cares?

[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:23.260]
Buy the dancing of the street just buy a lot of handgun

[01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:27.560]
It's a great alternative the working problems out and get me considered a population control

[01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:31.140]
Yes handgun they just might make your thing

[01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:34.240]
Hey, what are you here? What do you say? This like that guy said before great population

[01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:36.360]
Control there you go

[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:38.360]
Wow

[01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:43.880]
Yeah, you know they're being picked on okay. Oh, Johnny's picking on me. They're picking on the school

[01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:48.520]
So there you go that's you merican effing way man like you said before the exchange students all want to know

[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:52.740]
How come everybody's so angry over here? What are the angry about they have so much? What are the angry about?

[01:53:54.180 --> 01:53:55.620]
What are they all pissed off about?

[01:53:56.260 --> 01:53:58.880]
Maybe because they were brought up to be about just spoil little brats

[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:05.680]
Maybe their parents were too indulgent and didn't smack up the side of the head every now and say cut the crap and learn to appreciate what you got

[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:08.700]
Like Sabrina in there who's probably smarter than most of you out there

[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:10.340]
No, not probably

[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:15.260]
21 before one I don't know where she got it from. Must have been her mother

[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:18.720]
21 before well, I know it's just it's just a joke Sabrina

[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:24.360]
He enjoys being picked on not as much as Rimmer does though by the way. How's Rimmer doing? What's gonna happen without radio dropping? Okay

[01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:28.900]
If you oh, what a so you know, he's a good guy

[01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:32.580]
I have to preface it by saying that because otherwise he pouts for like week's at a time

[01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:35.220]
But what a suck whole Rimmer. I mean really seriously

[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:41.200]
That that even Kathy will it's even Monica Lewinsky never heard of a suck job like the one that Rimmer did this morning on the

[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:42.440]
station just on

[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:49.060]
Conscionable on acceptable. He's just looking to give me material I guess she over out the moon

[01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:49.440]
Me

[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:14.940]
There are schools will be taken by a particle being

[01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:20.160]
And friction is the only thing the father see you got to sit down to see me

[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:24.680]
You know, I think the poison is a second me is to help Bob come to me

[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:32.240]
Yeah, that's no fat beer can put it into every time call 44 or five sixty QM

[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:36.440]
So anyway, here's a great fact from Bob. How come the faxes are so good? We had some good calls

[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:38.600]
That a few good calls this week one one

[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:40.000]
several fun

[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.160]
But the faxes are a fantastic including one from John the gun hugger out there

[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:45.620]
He's squeezing it right now in a gun too

[01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:48.100]
So Joe Castello before I read this fax from Bob

[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:49.560]
Joe says that a lot of these

[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:53.980]
Daughters that are in here today for bringing your daughter to work day unlike Sabrina was sitting there very polite

[01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:55.760]
Needing her lunch and very grateful and very happy

[01:55:55.760 --> 01:56:00.700]
Unlike her that sitting in here with daddy in the other room a lot of these other girls around a building or running around like banshees

[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:04.800]
Turned a place up like man is his kids always do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I bet you do

[01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:06.640]
How do you like that?

[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:10.000]
See that makes my point about bridy little kids on discipline

[01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:15.540]
Then of course you look at their parents and you say oh my god. They're reproducing and you say oh, man

[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:20.720]
Can you really think about too many people in this building who ought to be reproducing? No, no

[01:56:21.540 --> 01:56:22.140]
Not at all

[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:24.920]
Anyway, here's this fax from Bob

[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:28.320]
It's his like you I traveled to western uroboa and I have many friends there in Switzerland

[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:32.080]
There's at least one rifle in every home and yet none of the slaughter we find here in the US

[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:34.540]
The reason every Swiss citizen serves in the military

[01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:38.320]
Absolutely correction and they are properly trained how to handle firearms

[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:41.820]
They're really responsible and they're not out to shoot each other employs at this brain job

[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:50.400]
Other countries in western europe germany the Netherlands the uk Italy guns are almost impossible to purchase without an extensive background check and proof of proper training

[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:51.880]
How do you like that? What a concept

[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:56.200]
It's also important to note that the police system in europe is fantastic

[01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:02.440]
The average police response time is less than five minutes for any emergency call whether it's as trivial as a pussy in a tree

[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:05.920]
Where we're serious as kids and black trench coats walking in the school and blowing everyone away

[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:12.080]
You think that that could have anything to do with the fact that the cops in europe are not bullies who just write tickets and harass harmless people

[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:13.340]
Who just want to smoke a joint?

[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:17.060]
Just might have something to do with it Bob excellent facts. Thank you, sir god bless you

[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:22.940]
I'm sorry that's neocod bless you. I don't want to get that kid out of bed under joint again. Oh, don't say joint. He might light one up

[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:27.340]
They're all impressionable. You know, you know what I'm saying light one up. Uh-huh exactly

[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:30.000]
Oh god

[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:34.220]
Just like that episode I told you about in rummaging yesterday

[01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:37.700]
I mean within a matter of seconds after this gunshot went off up into the air

[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:41.040]
There were police of every variety that ever been invented

[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:47.420]
It Lee came out of nowhere and just descended upon that location and that punk. I think he'll I won't be walking too good for a long time

[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:53.740]
They don't put up with a crap. Okay, in other words if you want to act barbaric and grotesque and like an animal

[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:57.240]
They're going to find a place to put you away for a very long time. It's not accepted

[01:57:58.220 --> 01:58:02.220]
But here what they want to find out the first thing is which NFL team can we sign you up for

[01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:06.500]
Now how many people will pay their money to watch your aberrant behavior?

[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:11.980]
I'm telling you the one thing I've learned on this station in these 16 months

[01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:18.500]
I mean and this is not an exaggeration. I have learned to have the greatest contempt for the sports nerds

[01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:21.040]
I mean far greater than I ever thought I possibly could have

[01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:25.220]
For people who have no scruples no principal no nothing

[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:26.960]
No

[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:31.960]
Live so as a result they have to live vicariously through some team. Okay, nothing wrong with rooting for a team

[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:37.420]
But I mean to this degree you have to be insane you have to be without any brain rhymes with insane

[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:43.620]
Very listen if the gangster can run a few yards if he can get us a first down man. Oh god

[01:58:43.620 --> 01:58:47.720]
Get out of my face get out go off of my cloud out of my planet

[01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:50.500]
Here's Hollywood. Hello

[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:52.260]
Hello, yes, sir

[01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:57.940]
It's the right you see thanks for taking my call. Thanks for making your call. Okay. Now we're even

[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:06.100]
Listen, I just want to make a remark. I'm a non-citizen. You were citizens. Are you an illegal alien? We'll trace the car

[01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:12.300]
I can give you my honest opinion. Okay. I think it all started

[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:13.860]
when you guys

[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:15.680]
formed your

[01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:17.020]
Republic here in

[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:22.760]
1776 this is a violent state and and and and

[01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:30.000]
You people are afraid to change laws everybody knows that it's the wrong thing to carry a gun

[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:34.440]
But still you have the law think you're afraid to change you mean civilized people know that

[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:37.020]
We have a lot of people in this country who aren't civilized

[01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:43.620]
Well, it's that's your opinion, but you don't think that's true. You don't think we have a lot of unsilvised people here

[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:50.280]
Maybe not more than anywhere else, but it's the you know, it's the culture. It's a culture shock

[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:59.040]
It's why those things don't happen in in what we call quote unquote the civilized world. I mean

[01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:00.000]
it

[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:06.620]
It happens here in neighborhoods where the least you would expect it yeah, you know and

[02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:09.740]
I think it's the shame that

[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.440]
Take for instance

[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:19.560]
Everybody agrees that it's wrong to have all those things on the website, but there is no law the changes is that

[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:24.240]
You you cannot put everything on the web

[02:00:26.220 --> 02:00:29.880]
I think it's a shame that whenever I travel here in you know

[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:33.120]
But you do understand that whatever's on the web that call it the worldwide web

[02:00:33.620 --> 02:00:37.460]
Because it is worldwide and people can download it and read in any part of the world

[02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:42.560]
And they're downloading in all those other countries that we're talking about and they're not running out in emulating or taking the messages

[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:45.400]
And killing people because they read something on a worldwide web

[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:51.820]
We have a lot of very ignorant people in this country sir. This is a very uneducated very impressionable very backward a juvenile country

[02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:52.600]
Well, mr

[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:54.520]
I just if everybody agreed that

[02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:56.380]
One of

[02:00:57.140 --> 02:01:03.060]
One of your laws are that everybody can carry arms here to protect themselves again for what

[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:07.680]
This I think this law was made when the English were here and afraid for the

[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:11.160]
For the engines the freight of the queen young

[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:15.800]
Yeah, a lot of people are afraid of the queen and maybe for wild animation

[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:21.200]
Right, you know, but I think we ought to let the deer arm themselves to protect themselves against the hunter

[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:25.160]
No, but it's it's the it's the violence in the people here

[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:30.800]
Yeah, yeah, if there is a much one I'm saying this is a violent barbaric country and the people embrace violence

[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:33.920]
They they can't there they can't get enough violence

[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:37.420]
They're they have an insatiable appetite for violence and as a result

[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:42.940]
Why should we be surprised that we see these things happening? Well, what's all the shock about doesn't surprise me

[02:01:42.940 --> 02:01:47.260]
It's grotesque and it's sad and it's tragic, but it's not surprising. It's a slaughterhouse

[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:49.640]
Yeah, but it is

[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:53.400]
Yeah, but why why is your government to frame to change the law?

[02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:59.920]
I think because the government is on the takeser the government is on the take from very very influential a powerful people

[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:04.560]
That spend billions of dollars to make sure that they don't change the laws money talks sir. There you go

[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:08.940]
God bless you sir. Thank you. How are we there to see you and I'm for them. Okay. I'm still believed

[02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:10.380]
Donkabel

[02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:16.920]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one all he's dutch therefore he knows what the real world is all about

[02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:24.400]
Never see a gun and I'm still on no, no, never see anybody shoot anybody. No most of the cops carry guns and I'm still on no

[02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:29.900]
Unheard of

[02:02:29.900 --> 02:02:36.700]
Rate education system their light years ahead of our education system number one in the world by the way in Netherlands are you aware of that number one?

[02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:41.500]
You know, I mean that must just be a coincidence right

[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:45.860]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 and you know

[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:52.120]
While he was talking I was thinking about a term that every time I hear I don't know what the laughter cry anger management classes

[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:58.520]
And you know the only people I ever hear being talked about including by some of the people on this radio station, which I won't much in any names

[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:03.240]
Professional athletes. Oh, he needs to go to anger management class

[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:06.780]
And then he'll be okay

[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:11.580]
Whichever illiterate jock they're talking about at the moment. Have you ever heard that?

[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:13.840]
anger management class

[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:20.920]
We have to take somebody to class to teach him that when you when you get pissed off and fired up, you know the low somebody away

[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.680]
Then that speak really well for americans society

[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:29.140]
We have so many scumbags right around that way and of course we shouldn't be worried about those kids

[02:03:29.140 --> 02:03:31.900]
You know like those two kids that shot up all these kids in the other school

[02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:34.660]
We just got our cuz they weren't jocks the jocks

[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:39.460]
We got to worry about make sure they get anger management training because after all we got to save them from whatever it is

[02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:43.980]
They're going to do to themselves like the dreams be well before we choke the next coach

[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:51.020]
In fact, maybe he'll even choke what's his name David Stern after they find him 25 grand for opening his big trap the other day

[02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:53.460]
Maybe he'll choke his ass or neck

[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:58.220]
Whichever is larger here's a parrain hello. Yeah, how you go okay, sir

[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:04.620]
Now I'm gonna call you about but it's nice to see that Jimmy Johnson doesn't matter criminal

[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:07.720]
He doesn't like exactly. He's the he's the gangster coach

[02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:12.560]
I'm the only one on a station that'll tell you that sir because all these other people just like the rim man

[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:17.540]
They're rimming them. They're sucking his ass. They're they're licking licking. This is the biggest suck whole station

[02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:21.280]
I've ever worked that in my life a bunch of a bunch of rubber stamps. We got in this radio station

[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:26.240]
Licky licky licky jimmy whatever you say whatever you do you're the greatest baby a lot of brown stains

[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:28.900]
That's right all over you ought to see the walls in this place man

[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:34.080]
What is another one? What I'm calling about is you know, I'm watching TV last night

[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:41.120]
I'm hearing all this rhetoric going on about this stuff and you know not once did I hear anything about you know

[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:45.480]
The problem we have with guns in this country, you know, we have our neighbors

[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:46.360]
Canada

[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:52.940]
Oh, but a whole year don't have as many murders in their country as we do in one week, right? I mean

[02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:58.840]
We can we can be Canada than a good weekend here in Miami and you know I'm I any I'd like to know which fuck has been is now

[02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:02.600]
Where's he you know, what kind of statement he's going to make after this

[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:05.080]
Defensive is and not race

[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:09.580]
But now that they took those billboards down with his push up there in the Denver

[02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:14.340]
He's probably really pissed at this I find it pretty funny some of the most terrific murders

[02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:20.880]
I've ever seen in this country just happened to happen in Mormon areas, you know in Mormon area. Yeah in Utah and

[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:25.180]
Work was asked in a good question the other day now when that happens they are do they stain

[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:30.240]
Magic underwear when that happens. Oh, no the diaper has to be taken off before he do that. Okay. Thanks

[02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:35.040]
In fact, I wonder Gary Gilmore before he got executed out there in Utah. I think that he stayed is

[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:41.640]
I'm sorry. Oh, he wasn't the five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one. I guess at that point

[02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:42.980]
We didn't make no difference

[02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:47.060]
Here's candle hello. Yeah, sir

[02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:53.820]
This is a statement. I like to make about the shooting that happened up in wherever north floor north America North America

[02:05:53.820 --> 02:05:59.300]
Yeah, wherever you where the people got blown away because I've been out of nowhere. Where was that I call a rarter that very good

[02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:04.920]
Excellent. This is besides you and you and Phil Hendry this whole country is stupid

[02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:10.180]
Because they think that proving security will stop shootings, which is cool because when I

[02:06:10.180 --> 02:06:11.880]
I just graduated about a year and a half ago

[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:16.820]
We had tight security, but I was able to bring whatever you need into school because there's always a way people

[02:06:16.820 --> 02:06:21.440]
Need to start watching the damn kids and watch what they're doing. I bring whatever you needed like why do you need it?

[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:23.860]
Guns drugs you name I put bring it into you

[02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:28.360]
But the problem was the parents never caught a knife or never bothered watching the kids are doing

[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:30.840]
That's the same thing half of my parents

[02:06:31.820 --> 02:06:37.240]
So the dishes off the crime about oh, we got a security. Oh, it's the internet. Oh, it's a TV not a damn rich

[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:41.380]
Rip that rich ass people's fault or the poor Kim Kim family's fault

[02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:43.700]
This got to get off the grass a little bit of kids are doing okay

[02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:46.920]
Thanks a lot. Thanks pal. You're all Neil okay, all right

[02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:53.860]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 8th, but see that's another part parenting in America's the law start

[02:06:54.380 --> 02:06:57.320]
You know, we got your junior and Sabrina and that's basically it

[02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:00.780]
So seriously parenting in this country is forget about it

[02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:06.520]
Just to make babies and then let them loosen the you know worry about having how how many BMWs you can have in the yard

[02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:11.200]
This food is delicious today, but it's starting my eye twitching. I wonder what that means

[02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:15.180]
You think it's that horse meat. I just did joke. It's just a joke George

[02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:22.520]
Thanks a lot Wayne. You're great American. We love Wayne. We love Hudson down there at Wayne Arnold's Royal Castle where you never get a hassle

[02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:26.820]
1250 look at that the thousand up 121 the Aztecs of 52

[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:28.280]
working you want huh

[02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:33.420]
Because that's the American effort ways long as everybody's got plenty of money. That's all we worry about

[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:36.340]
Who cares about being alive to spend it?

[02:07:40.880 --> 02:07:41.440]
Oh

[02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:46.880]
It's not just the one to two hour. It's a phenomenon

[02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:51.860]
You've found a red dog you've chugged a red wolf

[02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:56.360]
Now open your mouth and wrap your lips around a red cock

[02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:00.980]
Red cocks foamy head will lead you breathless

[02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:04.760]
Red cop goes down easy and it's never hard on your throat

[02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:10.120]
So reach into that box and wrap your fingers around a long neck red cock

[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:13.320]
You can shake it and spray it all over

[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:16.440]
Remember you can't beat a red cock

[02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:25.240]
Just look for the label with the big red pecker on the front opinion. Oh, the radio juhuh. Yeah, the radio play by play now the crystal

[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:31.320]
I think I think obviously Goldie based on his pinch hitting performance has got to be considered as a serious candidate

[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:36.260]
One thing about the Steve Goldstein and I think you'll agree with the Joe you don't better than anybody in all seriousness

[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:40.880]
I respect the work the Joe that the Steve Goldstein puts in

[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:44.620]
Be it preparing for a Panther radio broadcast

[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:50.060]
I've had the fortune of working with Joe at QA or not with Joe that with Goldie at 2am

[02:08:50.060 --> 02:08:56.140]
And Joe I think I think that Goldie's a hard worker and I really respect that and I think he's got to be considered in the next

[02:08:56.140 --> 02:08:57.900]
Well, you have been strong. How do you go, Ryan?

[02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:00.420]
What a suck up job that one

[02:09:00.420 --> 02:09:02.500]
Absolutely

[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:33.980]
Oh, you're right about the other population problem

[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:38.380]
Don't you think it goes back to the industrial revolution when they invented the you know

[02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:43.360]
All the antibiotics to prolong life and no little babies alive. No, no

[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:47.880]
How come they have all those antibiotics and all those other countries and their babies that running around shooting each other

[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:53.840]
Well, because well, it's a good point. It's a good point. Yeah. Okay, then what about this solution? Okay

[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:55.580]
That one didn't work. Let's try

[02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:57.880]
Uh, how about

[02:09:58.540 --> 02:10:03.140]
Flogging them in public and then putting them in prison for life for the rest of their life. Okay. Okay.

[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:05.460]
Okay, the only problem is these two are dead so I don't think it'll work too good

[02:10:05.460 --> 02:10:09.800]
Although I did say the other day because I was very angry after I saw this that they ought to hang the bodies out there

[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:13.280]
Like from a tree on the campus of a high school and let everybody come along and you know

[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:17.840]
Just whack it with baseball bands to do you know like they did with Mussolini and his wife after WW2

[02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:24.320]
I'm starting to talk like Jerry what's there now WW2? I must be really getting old five six seven oh five sixty

[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:33.600]
Count five sixty on the 18 W W two a Jerry Whistler just drove down the Ho Chi Minh Trail and ran into a couple of jungle bunnies on the way

[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:36.720]
Well, we'll see it. Will see something or what talk about guns

[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:42.700]
Well, maybe that's why he's uh in my mind right now since we have this gun topic boy. Yeah, get a little cheer

[02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:50.540]
Here's a pember pine. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Uh, that was Carl Lepotashi, right? What is it?

[02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:56.760]
Los Lini's wife Carl Lepotashi? Oh, I don't know. Okay. I agree with you, but I think that was her

[02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:57.920]
I was her name

[02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:01.620]
I agree with you. I uh

[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:08.980]
I think the problem comes in is with the guns. I think there's a proliferation of guns here in the United States and in Europe

[02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:15.320]
They have a strict gun control and they don't get any guns and then you do have your wackos up there

[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:19.700]
You do have your neonathe you do have your hula den and your anarchist there that

[02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:24.640]
Ones in a while they were act up, but they don't have any uh weapons that they can act up with

[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:27.260]
So obviously you don't see that like yes

[02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:34.000]
You know and a societal way what this is it's become a problem-solving method for americans is getting a gun

[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:38.500]
Having a gun and blowing somebody else away that that's what it's become and they don't do that in other places

[02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:42.460]
That's correct and they don't have the accessibility and also the education along with it

[02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:47.060]
Yeah, and here uh, you're never gonna solve it first of all because forget about the in constitution

[02:11:47.060 --> 02:11:50.980]
It's big business the gun industry here makes billions of dollars a year

[02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:55.180]
Right which is why in florida we want to make sure that there's no lawsuits against them because

[02:11:55.180 --> 02:12:01.080]
The politicians here all in the take from the gun industry absolutely are you bet that's one of the strongest lobbies around is the

[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:05.380]
All right and everything so that's you're never gonna be able to solve that so

[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:07.320]
unfortunately unless

[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:14.820]
We start thinking much more about human life and instead of guns or big business for the old mighty dollar

[02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:18.280]
Um, we're gonna continue seeing this once in a while

[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.380]
I got my own material. Okay, sir. My back. See you

[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:26.360]
I think what he's trying to say is it's a barbaric slaughterhouse. I think I don't want to put words in his mouth

[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:27.740]
Is that what he's trying to say? Uh-huh?

[02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:33.320]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line. Here's my Annie. Hello

[02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:39.220]
Hey Neil. Yes, sir. Uncle Neil. You're the best. Uh-huh. Listen the way I look at things sometimes

[02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:44.260]
It's only my opinion, but we got a war going on now in Yugoslavia. Yeah

[02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:48.680]
Why don't these kids join the army? I mean you can kill people legally

[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:50.600]
Yeah, why don't they go kill some sirby and there you go

[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:53.320]
That's a good idea take out the regression then that's an excellent idea

[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:58.220]
I mean we tried bombing Milosevic's hangout last night four o'clock this morning. Did it work? No

[02:12:58.220 --> 02:13:01.540]
I mean they you know they bombed the place, but was he there? No no

[02:13:01.940 --> 02:13:06.520]
We have the damnedest tough time you know with that damn god and Saddam Hussein and his

[02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:10.640]
Slavia Milosevic we just can't seem to hit him at the right time

[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:13.880]
Why don't they learn from the godfather? You know they hit us

[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:14.720]
We hit him back

[02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:22.040]
But like the guy said that great letter to the editor in the hairdress today the service only started acting up when we started bombing near a country

[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:23.280]
Right, they were nice

[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:27.380]
They were real nice before they were doing it. They were lightly killing the Albanians

[02:13:27.380 --> 02:13:30.860]
It was just a very light ethnic cleansing. They were doing in fact

[02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:34.460]
I think they were even breading them before they put them in those mass graves. Yeah

[02:13:35.140 --> 02:13:36.660]
Before they heated them up into microwave

[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:40.820]
Yeah Albanian Parmesan

[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:43.420]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:47.140]
5 60. Yeah, they have both sides of course even about

[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:52.540]
5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. I mean that is the Harold just continues man

[02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:56.420]
The dumber the letter you write them more likely they're going to put it in the paper. Okay, because they love it

[02:13:56.420 --> 02:13:57.880]
They never met a dummy they didn't like

[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:00.220]
Including their editor and publisher

[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:02.740]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello

[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:09.420]
Stop the news in the word god you'll pay for your okay. Yeah, you'll pay for your sins. Okay. Get off the toilet pal

[02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:12.540]
We all know we can hear it. I heard the sound and we now we can smell it

[02:14:12.940 --> 02:14:14.620]
Didn't hang up soon enough on that asshole

[02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:19.560]
5 6 7 0 5 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:22.580]
Where we've been going here's Miami. Hello

[02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:24.520]
Miami

[02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:30.860]
Uh, good afternoon Neil. Yes, sir Neil. God speaking. Okay. I appreciate you taking my call. Okay. I was

[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:35.260]
Wondering and I don't know I've been listening to you for the last couple of days and I listened to you on and off

[02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:39.720]
On when I'm in the car, but I was wondering if anyone has mentioned where are the parents?

[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:42.400]
Yes, what are the parents doing because we don't know

[02:14:42.820 --> 02:14:46.520]
You look at some of these things you look you read in the newspaper you listen to the media

[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:48.380]
These people have a small arsenal

[02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:54.240]
Where do they get the money to fund we're talking 16 17 year old kids at best working in McDonald's?

[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:59.820]
I mean does anybody have any answers to that? No, no, we don't know anything about the parents

[02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:04.340]
That except that they're very sorry any son of very a apologetic message like you'd expect them to do

[02:15:04.340 --> 02:15:08.380]
But other than that we haven't learned anything yet. It's amazing the deterioration of society

[02:15:08.380 --> 02:15:13.140]
Yeah, it's amazing because I mean I'm a 41 year old male and I have plenty of handguns

[02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:16.940]
That I used to buy when I was much younger, but to be quite honest with you I haven't fired them in 20 years

[02:15:16.940 --> 02:15:22.140]
So I'm gonna tell you something talk about parents parents have got to teach their kids that violence is bad

[02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:29.140]
It's ugly. It's unacceptable not not to a relish violence not to admire violence not to have an appetite for violence

[02:15:29.140 --> 02:15:32.660]
Violence is on effing acceptable. That should be the American way

[02:15:32.660 --> 02:15:37.880]
I agree with you wholeheartedly because people are like I said before that want to live in a violent environment like we do

[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:46.080]
It's a barbaric slaughterhouse and nobody with a brain nobody who realizes that life doesn't have to be like this wants to live in this kind of environment

[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:50.920]
I agree with you surrounded by animals. I agree with you. You know, I've heard you mention Las Vegas on occasion

[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:55.520]
I've been to Las Vegas once and in fact, I was in the last two years the first time I loved it

[02:15:55.520 --> 02:16:01.360]
Right, I would love to go back and I lived in Boston for three years and I don't know if you've ever been a Boston many many years to live there

[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:04.920]
Okay, well, I live in a small town called Nadek for three years and

[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:13.020]
Over in Boston, I'm sure if like from 1990 to 1993 you could walk the theater district there and you look going over to the Wang cinema

[02:16:13.020 --> 02:16:14.880]
Wang theater. Yeah, see you play

[02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:19.900]
Completely safe. Yeah, completely safe. You I mean you wouldn't feel that you were in any danger whatsoever

[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:27.340]
I'm like perhaps you know you walk here in downtown Miami, which but yeah, but how many cities in America can you think of where you really can do that at night?

[02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:31.820]
You know, I very very very few and certainly where we live here in one of them

[02:16:31.820 --> 02:16:35.240]
No, I agree with you whole hardly. I just think that that the culture

[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:41.080]
In the different parts of the country geographically speaking. Yeah, so different the way that people are brought up

[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:43.140]
It's almost like Americana in the Northeast

[02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:50.020]
Like a Norman Rockwell kind of environment versus like down here in Miami as an example or some of these things that are happening

[02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:53.900]
I mean, I took a look at the picture of it. Let me ask you this. Would you be walking the streets in Roxbury at night?

[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:56.680]
I'm no sir. Okay. No absolutely. Okay. Thanks

[02:16:57.780 --> 02:17:03.280]
You know, I'm a Miami resident and I just happened to hear the

[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:04.820]
Neil talk show

[02:17:04.820 --> 02:17:12.200]
My way home and I think it's absolutely horrible and I don't understand how anybody with values and morals or social conscience can

[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:14.600]
Alive such a thing to be broadcast on their station

[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:18.780]
This guy is just cursing the people insulting blast feeling

[02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:23.060]
Just spreading anger and hatred. I don't understand that. I mean

[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:28.140]
Do you have children? Do you have a family? Do you care what's going on?

[02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:30.300]
You know in the world? No

[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:32.600]
That's just a bad

[02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:35.560]
Stuff should be going around someone just

[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:41.760]
inventing all their hatred and anger at innocent people and maybe just let somebody crying on the sun the air

[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:45.780]
And maybe it's very popular and makes a lot of money for your station

[02:17:45.780 --> 02:17:51.960]
But this is really not what the world needs. I mean things are bad enough. I don't think we need to die like this

[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:57.000]
And I really find it very offensive and it's just horrible

[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:00.160]
I mean how would you like if your children were listening to that and

[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:03.000]
No, it happened a world where this kind of thing is acceptable

[02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:08.500]
Where people can talk like that and be paid for it and be endorsed. I mean

[02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:11.440]
I'm just horrified and disgusted

[02:18:12.540 --> 02:18:15.540]
And I'm sure I'm not the only person who feels that way

[02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:19.040]
Please try and take consideration of

[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:23.880]
You know the rest of the world and other people that have to listen to this kind of garbage

[02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:26.280]
And I hope you will because this is really

[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:32.200]
Something that's not acceptable if you want this world to get to be a better place. This is not the way to do it

[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:34.460]
Yeah, that's right. You tell him honey

[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:38.040]
If you want to live in a world where people blow each other's brains out

[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:42.780]
Then you got it but having this stuff on the radio where somebody's exercising is first amendment rights and voicing his opinions

[02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:45.180]
That's bad because she's an outside bitch

[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:48.700]
116 at 560 WQAM

[02:18:49.540 --> 02:18:50.920]
Here's a crawl spring. Hello

[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:56.700]
Pretty good sir. Listen, I'm listening to everybody talk on the radio. I'm listening to your comments

[02:18:56.700 --> 02:19:00.140]
And I agree with them that you deserve very violent society and

[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:04.000]
A premise of society and there's not enough punishment for violent acts

[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:10.720]
But I have a question to ask you and that is you take the worst neighborhoods in the Los Angeles or Chicago or New York

[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:12.420]
Yeah, how come um in those

[02:19:13.340 --> 02:19:15.740]
bad neighborhoods in those slums schools

[02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:19.640]
We don't have kids going in and blowing kids away in those schools. I mean in mass

[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:25.980]
quantities. I mean you look at this Columbine school. It wasn't a wonderful neighborhood. Yeah, it was a beautiful school

[02:19:25.980 --> 02:19:27.640]
Yeah, and these kids lived in the best

[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:30.540]
That's right upper middle class. That's right

[02:19:31.020 --> 02:19:31.940]
So how come

[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:38.940]
Because the streets what they're doing to make it get shot out on the street or in the school the fact is that in the inner cities

[02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:41.560]
You're talking about people are getting shot like cockroaches

[02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:46.380]
It's just a matter of time there'll be there'll be one of these in the in a ghetto somewhere

[02:19:46.380 --> 02:19:51.800]
So you're saying you're saying that it you know what differences to make is it 15 at the time or one at a time

[02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:55.120]
No, I'm not saying what difference does it make? I'm just saying it'll happen

[02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:56.680]
It happened. Look at the places where it happened

[02:19:56.680 --> 02:19:59.420]
Paduca can tucky a little tin Colorado

[02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:04.440]
Jones for Arkansas. Well, what is it what differences to make where it happens?

[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:06.820]
Yeah, but they're happening in good neighborhoods and good

[02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:10.880]
Good neighborhood and in rural neighborhoods where there are a lot of poor people doesn't make any difference

[02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:16.040]
They're happening in neighborhoods where the kids were brought up real strict and religious and where the kids were bunches skinheads

[02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:20.200]
I mean everything in between it's the American F and wacer didn't make any difference. That's the point

[02:20:20.800 --> 02:20:22.620]
Okay, thanks. Okay

5 6 7 0 5 60 pond 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line

[02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:33.680]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello, Neo. How are you okay, sir?

[02:20:33.980 --> 02:20:39.340]
The real truth of the matter is it really nowhere the little Billy Bob walk into a school in Harlem blows anybody away

[02:20:39.340 --> 02:20:44.240]
Of course not who cares that happens all the time when it does happen in when it does happen in middle America

[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:49.020]
That's from page news. It happens all the time in Harlem. I didn't know that well may not happen in the schools

[02:20:49.020 --> 02:20:50.940]
But it certainly happened in the street exactly

[02:20:50.940 --> 02:20:55.440]
That's I'm trying to say to this guy what differences it make whether people decide to do it out in the streets

[02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:59.760]
Where it's a more violent environment in the ghettos or in a school system somewhere where nobody expects it

[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:01.840]
The truth of the matter is in these small little towns

[02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:05.480]
We're hearing about middle America where mum and dad uncle Jeff throw in the whole gang

[02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:09.920]
They're always in the back teaching the kids how to shoot guns. Yeah, and where's their responsibility?

[02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:13.720]
They don't have any you can't complain about their responsibility because they don't have any

[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:19.000]
This jackass on NBC the other night is blaming society and TV in Hollywood

[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:24.120]
Of course you haven't talked about what mum and dad where mum and dad now who is that what's jackass with this?

[02:21:25.020 --> 02:21:30.560]
Some guy to some guy from the police in at MSNB from the city. Oh, ever we interviewed on

[02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:32.980]
The time MSNBC my lunch is already coming up

[02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:37.380]
Okay, thanks a lot. Okay. Anything that's on MSNBC except

[02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:44.840]
Cross except except oh no the one show I do like on there is what's it called timeline date line timeline

[02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:49.340]
Date line which has the timeline date line timeline with Jane Paul. That's a good show

[02:21:50.940 --> 02:21:56.880]
Only what differences are making if it was 798081 you know what I'm saying that stupid song whatever was that if it was 7870

[02:21:56.880 --> 02:22:00.560]
You cut it out Jane stopping a goody tushies. No, it all bitch

[02:22:01.040 --> 02:22:06.420]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T line. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello

[02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:13.440]
Well, yes sir. Yeah, I am three things yesterday. Did you ever read the letters to the editor Eddie Pope?

[02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:15.580]
Yes, I did I mentioned that

[02:22:15.580 --> 02:22:20.340]
How dare he the one good column that he ever wrote in all the 500 years he's been here

[02:22:20.340 --> 02:22:22.760]
And he gets flutter with calls from these indignant

[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:27.820]
Buttlickers who want to kiss Jimmy on the ass how dare he have the audacity to question Jimmy?

[02:22:28.060 --> 02:22:29.940]
I just couldn't believe it. Isn't that incredible

[02:22:29.940 --> 02:22:33.520]
And that's exactly what I'm in trying to tell you these sports nerds

[02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:37.560]
They're they're the ones who created this if the sports fans started revolting and say hey

[02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:42.200]
We're not gonna spend these big bucks to subsidize these goons these criminals these scumbags

[02:22:42.200 --> 02:22:45.580]
Then you better believe the league would say hey, guess what these guys?

[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:47.360]
They're not you can't sign them

[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:51.860]
But as long as they keep fill in the stand and as long as people only care about you know who can run fast

[02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:56.220]
And who carried a ball then that's what's gonna happen. It's a scumbag league

[02:22:56.220 --> 02:22:59.280]
There was labaster the week before who said who cares, you know

[02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:03.440]
Whoever is gonna put money on the table, but you know you read that one column

[02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:06.320]
JJ had to go to age Wayne

[02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:08.560]
for this you know and

[02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:14.460]
And Wayne said if he if they win games nobody will care. That's a rain set and he's unfortunately he's right

[02:23:14.460 --> 02:23:20.920]
And he and his wife Marty they were upset because they couldn't get their name on that children and women and they were very upset that Doug McLean was seen

[02:23:20.920 --> 02:23:24.060]
You know mouthing four letter words on close-ups shots on the camera

[02:23:24.060 --> 02:23:27.880]
There which is one of the reasons he got Candace coach of the Panthers. They were real upset about that

[02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:31.160]
Thank them on the Pacific Ritz. I think it's what you're looking for

[02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:33.400]
The other thing was I noticed at the NRA there

[02:23:33.400 --> 02:23:36.980]
There ain't no meeting a skit was scheduled next week for I talked about that

[02:23:36.980 --> 02:23:41.780]
Yeah, and they've had a water. We're done and even take poor charlotte and has toon's picture off the billboards

[02:23:41.780 --> 02:23:42.980]
How do you like that? Yeah?

[02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:44.380]
There you go

[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:49.200]
H2A Leonard Lee and Ardol de Caprio. Yeah

[02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:53.860]
You got to read that little article about the island the name of the island where he was capsized from

[02:23:54.540 --> 02:23:56.380]
Okay today with which paper

[02:23:56.380 --> 02:24:00.920]
Two A the Harold okay. See you. Bye. Okay. Let me dig in a waist basket here

[02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:06.660]
Oh god look at that. Look how nice the hero fits in my waist basket. Oh, it's beautiful in there

[02:24:07.220 --> 02:24:11.160]
Here's the sports here's the business here's the Broward good article by the way Fred Grim today

[02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:17.140]
And R.A. Cut in the crossfire good articles about time Fred nice. Okay everyone about once every six months he writes a good one

[02:24:17.740 --> 02:24:22.420]
Let's say boys will be others Leo de Caprio. There's that screamer that little floater

[02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:26.200]
Probably never dreamed he'd land in the drink again after Titanic

[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:32.200]
But unlucky Leo had a leap overboard when the boat he was uh in during the filming of the beach was swamped in southern Thailand

[02:24:33.140 --> 02:24:35.920]
Oh, I bet he's having a good time in Thailand by the way George

[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:39.700]
Amman soon whipped up by high waves off the island of

[02:24:40.660 --> 02:24:42.600]
OPHU KET Foucait

[02:24:43.700 --> 02:24:45.980]
Thailand flooding the boat and dragging it out to sea

[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.320]
How do you like that? Well, just Foucait man

[02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:52.940]
If you can't sail it just Foucait

[02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:54.620]
Okay, thank you sir

[02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:03.220]
Okay, where we gone. Let's go to somewhere north waterdale. Hello

[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:09.120]
Couple things, Neil. Yes, sir. Are they riffs? It's got a fifth and last night in Texas reference to why?

[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:11.700]
Scotty Fippen was arrested for DWI

[02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:14.620]
Yeah, how am I meant that? Oh right

[02:25:14.620 --> 02:25:18.460]
I've got and a talk show host was fired for

[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:23.640]
For what a bad joke about the shooting the talk show host the fired

[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:29.120]
Yeah, oh yeah, this is the guy with a fanny pack. Okay, I thought I was getting it'll

[02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:32.640]
That's the guy with a fanny pack. You're not a bad guy. Yeah, you are you're annoying

[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:36.800]
And by the way, he must lost his job at the arena there last the half of the season never saw him no more

[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:39.700]
And wonder even though we were losing him playing badly it was became less painful

[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:43.740]
Because I didn't have to answer 85,000 different questions about you know

[02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:48.980]
What color is John's car and this and that and is my dog take a dump in a house and you know

[02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:54.440]
Be got with a fanny pack. He was like a security guard at the Macarena for a while for a short while

[02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:56.760]
Until maybe he annoyed too many people

[02:25:57.940 --> 02:26:01.060]
56705 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:06.340]
I mean when you can't even go out and take a leak without something you know while giving you the third degree one of your whole life story

[02:26:06.340 --> 02:26:07.280]
Because the reyenta

[02:26:09.140 --> 02:26:11.080]
But you're okay pal just stay away

[02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:12.800]
Here's a homestead hello

[02:26:13.580 --> 02:26:17.100]
Okay, sir a couple things you're talking about the

[02:26:18.380 --> 02:26:21.640]
Unsafe streets. Yeah, well like the city mind you forget it. I mean they

[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:24.880]
They're a toilet they close the buildings at seven o'clock, right?

[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:30.520]
To get the hell out of town. Uh-huh. I learned that in the mid-Azure security guards. They under the counters exactly

[02:26:32.340 --> 02:26:38.740]
I keep guns and I collect and I'm also a parent of two boys, right and

[02:26:38.740 --> 02:26:43.720]
When my kids were old enough I thought of the difference between a real gun and a flat and a phony gun

[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:47.320]
And they to this day respect real guns

[02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:53.300]
They have no problem, right and one of them is a school teacher. He teaches in the roughest school in Dave County

[02:26:53.820 --> 02:26:55.000]
Middle school wow

[02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:58.420]
I firmly believe that the whole problem comes down to parenting

[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:02.080]
Parents are not you know, they're working two jobs just to pay the mortgage

[02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:04.340]
They don't have time to spend with our kids

[02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:08.120]
As our parents did spend with them. Well, let me ask you this question

[02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:11.340]
I mean aren't these things that I realize that this is really revolutionary

[02:27:11.340 --> 02:27:13.760]
But before people start making babies

[02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:19.320]
Don't you think they ought to kind of like sit down and think about how much it's going to cost to raise a kid and put them through school

[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:24.000]
Or hopefully maybe the college and dress them and feed them and close them and all of these things

[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:28.700]
Don't you think maybe that makes some sense? Yes, but where they gonna learn and of course in America the worst problem

[02:27:28.700 --> 02:27:32.920]
One of the worst problems we have is that the people who are least able to erase children

[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:36.300]
They're the ones who are reproducing the most perhaps their parents aren't and

[02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:38.400]
Those are the ones who are having like litters

[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:42.520]
Perhaps their parents aren't teaching them what it what it takes to raise a child. Yeah, why not being there?

[02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:44.720]
But why don't we teach people these things? I agree

[02:27:45.260 --> 02:27:47.800]
People all kinds of abstract things speaking of the school system

[02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:53.260]
But things that have to do like with real life like maybe even writing a check stuff like that. We don't teach anybody about that

[02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:54.100]
Right. That's true

[02:27:55.620 --> 02:27:59.820]
The thing you played earlier the handgun did right get a handgun right that's what these kids

[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:02.200]
They they learn that early on

[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:03.780]
Because they had they're not

[02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:04.580]
Respect

[02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:09.800]
Respect for life or well, but that's the American society when when human life becomes very a cheap

[02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:13.120]
Then you got real problems and that's that I mean that we are right now

[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:15.860]
You scrape away all the other stuff about the parents and who's fault it is

[02:28:15.860 --> 02:28:20.460]
But when this is the value system of a society when human life is cheap and disposable

[02:28:20.980 --> 02:28:26.260]
Then you got real problem the only thing that I'm gonna get worse. I know I'll see it the passport off. Okay

[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:33.660]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pond 5 60 on a 18 T wireless land or there are a lot of people out there who is that like for example

[02:28:33.780 --> 02:28:35.800]
Cory saving was in this morning. He's a good guy

[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:41.540]
But he's talking about you know something he wants to visit here and visit it and where has he ever been his parents when he was 17

[02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:43.100]
They sent to Israel. Oh

[02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:43.940]
Israel

[02:28:46.740 --> 02:28:52.140]
Why why why would anybody in their right mind while with any person in its right mind want to go to Israel

[02:28:52.140 --> 02:28:55.020]
Just because you got it your Jewish you got to go to Israel. No

[02:28:55.740 --> 02:28:58.140]
Go see the real world. That's not the real world

[02:28:58.540 --> 02:29:02.080]
That's a slaughterhouse. That's where everybody sitting around waiting to get blown up on a bus

[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:07.880]
That's where people are fighting over a crappy piece of land in the middle of a desert all desert

[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:16.740]
Got like him, you know who he's talking about going on vacation to the Grand Canyon and backpacking and this and that and doing all the all of these things

[02:29:16.740 --> 02:29:23.220]
Why are the backpack is way through Europe and stay at the youth hostels and to you know go to Amsterdam and go to a Paris and go to all

[02:29:23.220 --> 02:29:26.700]
Rome and see what the real world is all about. I'm not making it up

[02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:31.760]
I have no best I've invested interest. I had no idea 12 years ago when I first made my trip to Europe what I was gonna

[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:32.580]
counter over there

[02:29:33.380 --> 02:29:35.000]
Flood difference between day and night

[02:29:35.580 --> 02:29:38.420]
And yeah, there are places where the people are scumbags like in France

[02:29:38.420 --> 02:29:44.260]
I wouldn't go back to Paris if they paid for the trip if they give me $10,000 spending money unless I could leave it after the first five minutes

[02:29:45.900 --> 02:29:47.040]
scumb trash garbage

[02:29:48.160 --> 02:29:48.880]
human excrement

[02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:55.540]
But there are a lot of places where where the people are real honest to God people and they really know how to live and you don't live in a slaughterhouse

[02:29:55.540 --> 02:30:00.260]
And you can walk the streets and people are civilized and they have respect for human life. Wow. What a concept

[02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:07.920]
So the fact that I respect those kinds of societies and that's my idea of what life ought to be all about. Well, if you can't handle that that's too bad

[02:30:08.820 --> 02:30:09.140]
Neon

[02:30:10.700 --> 02:30:18.060]
25 till two of five sixty wq. I'm playing that and I'm thinking about these people to talk about the devil this and the devil that and I was thinking about the image you know this red devil

[02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:24.760]
With the horns on the head and the big long tail and the pitch folk. I mean devil without a pitch for it. They ain't no real devil

[02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:29.520]
You know I don't have a big long pitch folk. I think he's gonna stick in the back dome with it. Yeah, probably

[02:30:30.700 --> 02:30:39.720]
Huh? I mean, what's more fanciful the devil or sat sanny clause at least Santa Claus. You know he's fuzzy and he's got a beard and he only bugs you only once a year

[02:30:39.720 --> 02:30:42.740]
You know and comes down with chimneys courts court like that

[02:30:43.360 --> 02:30:46.380]
But the devil he's there all the time doing all these bad things

[02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:52.700]
All this evil every time something happened the devil made me do it all of these things. That's right

[02:30:53.280 --> 02:30:58.300]
God is good. God is wonderful. God is love. But the devil. Ah, there's the problem. There's the rub

[02:30:59.520 --> 02:31:01.980]
So quit rubbing it. Here's West Palm Beach. Hello

[02:31:03.780 --> 02:31:14.100]
And yes, Neil. Yes, I am. I just want to tell you what I feel and all these guys who need handguns. Yeah, a bunch of pussy faggots. That's right

[02:31:14.100 --> 02:31:29.500]
And that's what I said. That's what no penis. And how come there's a quarter of a million handguns? How do you're in T. It's your own

[02:31:29.500 --> 02:31:34.360]
person? Well, they've got that five each. No, that's one per person. We just haven't spread them around. We haven't distributed them all yet

[02:31:34.360 --> 02:31:36.680]
Who's the faggots? Okay. Thank you. That's right

[02:31:37.440 --> 02:31:44.000]
Just like a lot of the sports baggots who call in on this radio station who are lives that are obsessed with the guys running around with tight pants and jocks wraps on

[02:31:45.060 --> 02:31:50.940]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. The devil. Oh the devil's gonna get you

[02:31:51.880 --> 02:31:56.840]
I mean stop and think about that really just just stop. I know it's very difficult to depress. We don't want to be depressing

[02:31:56.840 --> 02:31:57.180]
Well

[02:31:58.100 --> 02:32:05.300]
Think about that people who really honest to God. Oh, he say God. Yeah, honest to F and God believe in the devil

[02:32:08.940 --> 02:32:13.860]
Oh, and you know the devil is horny all the time. That's why sex is evil because devil's got those horns on that's right

[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:20.680]
He's got those two big crooked hook to rock. It's like I tell you one thing better than the antlers on the mantelpiece

[02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:23.260]
How about the devil's horns? That would be something then

[02:32:23.740 --> 02:32:25.380]
Tell some stories to your grandkids

[02:32:26.840 --> 02:32:30.920]
How you got you the devil and you got his horns right there on the mantel to show it

[02:32:31.720 --> 02:32:34.640]
Right, Mickey? Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[02:32:35.120 --> 02:32:37.580]
Yeah, it is yes, sir. Oh, yeah great

[02:32:38.340 --> 02:32:40.820]
Just want to comment. I'm sick and tired of people

[02:32:41.220 --> 02:32:43.600]
Blaming guns for all the problems of this country right

[02:32:44.680 --> 02:32:49.360]
Great man guns are beautiful. Hey guns are wonderful. Hey, you believe in your first amendment rights, don't you?

[02:32:49.600 --> 02:32:54.860]
Yeah, right. Oh, no, you don't we sir don't waste don't waste my time with the baloney about a well-regulated militia

[02:32:54.860 --> 02:32:56.980]
I don't like it. I don't

[02:32:56.980 --> 02:32:59.420]
Don't tell me what I should believe you ask me

[02:32:59.420 --> 02:33:03.220]
I don't care what you believe. Okay. I don't guess what then I don't care what you believe

[02:33:03.220 --> 02:33:05.740]
How do you like that gun hugger? I was gonna listen to you

[02:33:05.740 --> 02:33:10.060]
But if you don't care what I believe then go listen to some other show find out what large ass limbo believes

[02:33:10.060 --> 02:33:10.620]
Illigridia

[02:33:11.100 --> 02:33:13.580]
Illigrid with all your right wing bull crap all the way down the road

[02:33:14.540 --> 02:33:21.640]
He doesn't care what I believe see what I'm saying. I'm delighted this guy call because he's a classic example of the gun hugger mentality

[02:33:21.640 --> 02:33:23.560]
He doesn't care what anybody else believes

[02:33:24.860 --> 02:33:28.220]
I mean they had slaves before the revolution before the civil war too

[02:33:28.220 --> 02:33:31.820]
Does that mean that because Jefferson had slaves and slept with at least one of them?

[02:33:31.880 --> 02:33:33.960]
Therefore it should be okay today. Is that what that means sir?

[02:33:34.300 --> 02:33:35.600]
Probably in his mind. Yes

[02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:38.360]
At least put him in the right place, you know

[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:44.300]
This baloney about well this says this and this says that and by the way speaking of that

[02:33:44.300 --> 02:33:46.880]
I'll tell you another part of the big problem we got in America today

[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:52.000]
And I it's because I cliche but it is oh so true now that we got people like lonely fifty dollars

[02:33:52.500 --> 02:33:55.720]
I'm Jerry Spence on there and all these other media horrors

[02:33:55.720 --> 02:34:00.800]
To pontificate and share their expertise with us is if they know something lawyers

[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:04.920]
See in America you've got to commit the most abhorrent crimes

[02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:10.180]
But hey guess what people don't get punished all the time because if they got enough money or enough fame like

[02:34:10.180 --> 02:34:13.780]
OJ and they got the right attorneys in there to write lawyers to manipulate the system

[02:34:13.780 --> 02:34:16.140]
We don't ever punish them they go out and play golf every day

[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:23.960]
That's right lawyers with no conscience scumbag lawyers defending scumbag clients

[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:28.340]
People who are threatened the real danger to all society that's what America's all about

[02:34:29.020 --> 02:34:32.540]
We don't give a crap about justice. We just give a crap about who can afford the best lawyers

[02:34:34.140 --> 02:34:35.260]
With no conscience

[02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:38.300]
Right Johnny Cochrane? Yeah

[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:44.400]
May 5th

stations are giving away trips to cancels. I'm we're giving away trips to Mexico City

[02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:55.940]
But who are we are bringing Mexico to use that's right. We're giving away Mexicans real live Mexicans

[02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:57.340]
Go around

[02:34:58.060 --> 02:35:02.140]
We're smuggling illegal aliens across the border in the wheel well of a station back

Then we hope you want to you imagine your own personal Mexicans. They'll wash your car

[02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:13.520]
Audio

[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:16.760]
He's a headquarter when you hear this time

[02:35:17.580 --> 02:35:22.320]
And win a Mexican members of this station and their families are not eligible to own Mexicans

[02:35:22.320 --> 02:35:29.300]
Fading and deloshing the Mexicans his winners responsibility station assumes no liability for infectious diseases carried by Mexicans

[02:35:29.300 --> 02:35:31.460]
That's a great single-be-myo with your own home

[02:35:31.460 --> 02:35:35.700]
Every day with your very own Mexicans people to think away

[02:35:36.540 --> 02:35:40.000]
Okay, 144-560 WQM love that Cinco de Mayo unfortunately

[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:46.800]
Is that anybody in this kind of interest in that holiday? No, we have any Mexicans here no besides down there in like Florida City picking grapes

[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:51.920]
Why is that why don't we have some nice Mexicans here? I'm sorry. I should never have asked you that question

[02:35:52.380 --> 02:35:54.440]
I mean Luis Miguel. He's nice. He's okay

[02:35:55.540 --> 02:35:56.860]
Here's the Hollywood hello

[02:35:57.360 --> 02:36:02.240]
Neil and then there's yes sir. Yeah a couple things um. I've been listening to you. I'm trying to write my art paper

[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:07.000]
But I couldn't help but call okay um. I'm a younger guy. Yeah, I'm going 25. You know

[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:12.620]
But uh, I think this this whole situation with all the violence and everything with these kids blowing up and everything

[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:16.500]
I think it all starts with with the parenting, you know, yeah

[02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:22.600]
I'm gonna use myself as an example, okay? I was as like 12 years old. I was taken hunting

[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:24.700]
Okay, by my pastor the church

[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:30.260]
Okay, my new thing hunting by the pastor of the church. Yeah. Why is that? Well

[02:36:30.780 --> 02:36:36.480]
My mother was single mother, you know, and I didn't really have a father figure or anything right and the pastor had stepped in

[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:38.160]
whatever and

[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:42.480]
You know, it might be messed up after taking a little kid to go kill animals whatever

[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:49.220]
But it taught me a respect for handgun. Okay, okay, the other thing is that my mother was a strict disciplinarian

[02:36:49.220 --> 02:36:54.940]
She didn't beat me, but she spanked me, right? And I'd like to go on ma. Yeah, you know

[02:36:54.940 --> 02:36:59.860]
And you know at the time when when she did it, whatever, you know, I'd be pissed at her because she spanked me whatever now

[02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:06.320]
I by fully understand, you know, and I think that these kids today are taught that as soon as a parent lays a hand on them

[02:37:06.320 --> 02:37:09.320]
That is child abuse and I kind of get a lawyer and parental

[02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:13.100]
Malpractice right right and

[02:37:13.100 --> 02:37:18.980]
You know and and now that parents are scared to death to discipline their kids so they give them time out

[02:37:18.980 --> 02:37:21.480]
What the hell is that? You know, that's nothing

[02:37:22.020 --> 02:37:26.180]
You know and one of my friends now I'm not proud of it. I'm not proud of this

[02:37:26.180 --> 02:37:31.400]
But one of my friends that you know, I met in high school or whatever he had grown up two parents in the household

[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:34.820]
No discipline whatsoever. He's now doing life in Rayford

[02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:39.420]
You understand what I'm saying. Yeah, I mean no respect for human life nothing

[02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:45.720]
You know, but me I have a single parent with a mother that taught me from the get-go. Yeah, you know, to respect human life

[02:37:46.240 --> 02:37:50.020]
You know, so I think some that has to be done about the parenting situation

[02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:53.960]
And I know we can't say that you know parents have to be licensed to have kids or whatever

[02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:59.320]
But I think that we can hold parents responsible for their kids actions. Amen. You know what I'm saying? Amen

[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:01.400]
But I have a request. Yes, sir

[02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:07.460]
It's like the Limerick's phone, you know what I'm talking about yeah at the end is as if you think this song dirty

[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:11.640]
Go after yourself, right? Okay, and can I call someone's do you sure? Yeah?

[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:14.400]
Yeah, everyone that's playing football today in Cooper City tonight

[02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:17.120]
Do you expect okay? See you later. See you

[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:20.520]
Now which one is that if you think this is dirty go after yourself. What is that?

[02:38:20.820 --> 02:38:22.860]
Minus farmer's daughter. Oh farmer's daughter

[02:38:23.860 --> 02:38:27.100]
Boy you're right on top of that huh? Oh, if farmer's daughter is in this

[02:38:28.740 --> 02:38:31.460]
Now you put farmer's daughter in the in the thing

[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:36.540]
There's for a cock the mishpah there's no farmer's daughter in it. No farmer's life

[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:45.780]
But in there either. No, it's not in there. I'll get to it. Just a couple of minutes. I know exactly I know where to put my finger on it and the bit too

[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:48.920]
Okay, where we going here's a big pine key. Hello

[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:52.800]
Neil God. Yes, sir. How are you today great? All right

[02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:58.880]
I'm calling into a response to that call you have I think it was on tape about the lady that

[02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:03.680]
Oh, yeah, that's an old one. Yeah. Yeah, I believe so by the way for the guy that comes and I don't care what you think

[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:06.420]
Yes, what we don't care what you think either smart ass. I think we're going

[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:12.800]
I'd like to put my two cents worth in of how much I think your values are excellent and

[02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:20.700]
We incorporate them into our family and use them for our kids every day to get a daily dose of Neil God, right?

[02:39:20.700 --> 02:39:25.920]
And I got my head screwed on straights or DNH makes all the sense that we're doing all harm and

[02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:29.980]
That's right period. That's it. We're simple. It's so simple. It's such common sense

[02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:35.200]
What's the big deal isn't cost any money? Don't have to go to some stupid service and mumble a lot of stupid words

[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:39.660]
Right, you don't have to pray to some supernatural being that certainly doesn't exist and never responds anyway

[02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:46.180]
Correct and two years ago. I couldn't get my fun into Boycecalf because we had put down the

[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:48.160]
We didn't believe in God

[02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:50.840]
This year he's got to start

[02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:57.560]
Because he believes in God now, but when he says the pledge he says Neil God there you go

[02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:04.260]
So there is a God and God both you got into the boys. Thanks God. Thank you. Keep up the good. Yeah, take it

[02:40:04.260 --> 02:40:07.460]
Neil God, I don't keep saying that. Why do you say that? It's like you know what's like?

[02:40:07.460 --> 02:40:10.860]
It's like the assholes that kept asking where did I wear the armor because on the TV show on whammy

[02:40:12.700 --> 02:40:17.300]
See, I never should have done that because I thought that there might be a little bit of intellect out there that people might

[02:40:17.300 --> 02:40:22.440]
understand that it was a joke that it was a theoretical that it was a biting commentary and like oh

[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:25.360]
How come is he like really religious isn't that kind of hypocritical?

[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:27.540]
You know like

[02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:33.800]
What is that? Where the hell do that come from? How can you get that with two teas, baby? Huh?

[02:40:35.420 --> 02:40:39.540]
Yeah, well, even this thing's acting up today. Well, I want to pick on Daruligan. You leave him alone

[02:40:39.540 --> 02:40:42.860]
He deserves his 80th chance, don't you raford?

[02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:47.440]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 in the 18 2 wireless line

[02:40:48.940 --> 02:40:53.760]
Oh, he just makes so much damn sense when you're gonna stop saying these things. Yeah, that's a problem too much sense

[02:40:54.900 --> 02:40:59.700]
They got it, you know, I don't care what you think. Well, I'm great. Why would you call somebody if you don't want to have a conversation

[02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:03.840]
What's the point? You want to make a speech get yourself a little soapbox go out on a street corner somewhere

[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:07.020]
Meantime, I'm talking to hundreds of thousands of people every week in this guy

[02:41:07.020 --> 02:41:11.560]
You know, he don't want to have a conversation because he doesn't care what anybody else thinks unless of course we agree with him

[02:41:14.180 --> 02:41:19.840]
Which we all know exactly what that is that the American fucking way unless I'm looking now because I don't trust that thing
