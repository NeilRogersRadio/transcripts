[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]
Are you doing your draft show today, Neil?

[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:01.900]
Yes.

[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:02.680]
Okay, good.

[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.360]
Got more draft conversation with Neil Rogers coming up.

[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.140]
You're right, D-Full.

[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.580]
For once in your life, you're right, Tweeter.

[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.740]
It's a strange thing, isn't it?

[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.280]
It's about time.

[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.540]
Yeah.

[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.760]
You know, it was some weight.

[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.680]
Okay, I will.

[00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:12.040]
Thanks.

[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.700]
QS Sports Time is 10 o'clock.

[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.120]
This is Sports Radio 560.

[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.100]
Now, will you QAM, Miami Fort Lauderdale?

[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.260]
So, what does that say?

[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.580]
Sports Radio 560.

[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.140]
Tell me if you will, Miami Fort Lauderdale,

[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.280]
as that's the Neil Rogers show to talk to Neil,

[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.240]
called 560.

[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.140]
560.

[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.300]
Told free for date and marriage,

[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.680]
or pound 560 on yourself, all.

[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.580]
The opinions of Neil, his guests,

[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.400]
callers or anyone else on the show

[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.160]
do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM,

[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.260]
easily read acquisitions or the easily broadcast groups.

[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.240]
Now, Neil Rogers, on Sports Radio 560.

[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.280]
QAM.

[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.460]
More names will never be the same.

[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.160]
Starting this Monday,

[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.560]
560.

[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.460]
WQAM presents

[00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.480]
Tanner in the morning.

[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.800]
Tanner in the morning.

[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.200]
Yeah.

[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.520]

[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.700]
Monday through Friday,

[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.220]
6am to 10am only,

[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.880]
on 560.

[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.160]
WQAM.

[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.180]
Why you air in shit like this?

[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.620]
6% to Dr. Jack.

[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.740]
6% to Dr. Jack.

[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.980]
Oh!

[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.620]
Look in your machine,

[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.480]
cause there's no turning back.

[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.840]
6% to Dr. Jack.

[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.320]
I've got no digestive tract.

[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.100]
And my host is dead,

[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.740]
I know good in the rack.

[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.500]
I'm looking very pale.

[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.360]
And my host men start to live a ring my mail.

[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.620]
Please help me before they throw you in jail.

[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.260]
Who the?

[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.140]
Another sick person to Dr. Jack.

[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.820]
I'm ready for the trip.

[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.360]
Talk me up to the ID and let it breathe.

[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.020]
Okay.

[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.160]
Gotta join tall rollin' hope to my road's clear.

[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.920]
Yeah.

[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.980]
Anyway, it's too late for him because the poor Dr. Jack,

[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.700]
he's going to jail 10 to 15 years.

[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.760]
You know what they said?

[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.520]
Or 10 to 25?

[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.220]
What they should have done was given him a medal.

[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.840]
That's what the judge should have done, that bitch.

[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.120]
She should have said,

[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.760]
I'm gonna present you with an award here.

[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.380]
Here's a medal.

[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.500]
Hang it around your neck for having a courage to stand up to this crap.

[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.260]
But of course, no, we gotta put him in jail

[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.700]
because he broke the law.

[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.440]
That's the American fucking way.

[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.220]
Right, that's right.

[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.660]
He broke the law.

[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.680]
He assisted people who wanted to die who were like in tremendous pain and suffering.

[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.340]
Saying, I'm dying over here.

[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.940]
He helped them to end the pain.

[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.900]
And therefore 10 to 25 because the judge, this bitch,

[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.940]
wow, I'm gonna show you.

[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.120]
You flondered that you had the audacity to go on TV and say all of these things.

[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.260]
And I'm gonna stick your old decaying ass in jail.

[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.880]
We know nobody can help you, croak.

[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.400]
The word is that he's gonna go on a hunger strike.

[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.060]
Isn't that what he's saying?

[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.140]
He's gonna go along, you know.

[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.820]
Huh?

[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.260]
How are you gonna tell?

[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.280]
Exactly, in his case.

[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.580]
My favorite part of the story though is the members of this is kind of like a Monti Python thing, you know.

[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.520]
Members of the anti-Covorkian disability rights group not dead yet.

[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.840]
There shouldn't be up there in Michigan.

[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.340]
They should be here in Florida.

[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.520]
We need them down here.

[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.560]
For about half of the population and about 70% of the population in Broward.

[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.360]
Not dead yet.

[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.560]
We're close, but we're not dead yet.

[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.660]
Hey, I'm getting better.

[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.960]
Yeah, don't be too sure.

[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.000]
Members of the group don't not dead yet who say he targets vulnerable people related with a sentencing yesterday.

[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.120]
They cheered, cried and embraced outside the courtroom, singing and chanting.

[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.540]
Ding dong, Jack is gone and get to jail, Jack.

[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.640]
And don't you come back.

[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.560]
Get to jail, Jack.

[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.700]
I kind of like that.

[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.700]
Oh, there's a vocal Bryant thought for you right there.

[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.840]
Huh?

[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.260]
He could put that to music easy.

[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.680]
Get to jail, Jack.

[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.600]
And don't you come back.

[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.820]
Yeah.

[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.380]
Meanwhile, while the not dead yet people were jumping up and down in glee.

[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.580]
The hemlock society, the right to die activists, decried the imprisonment of their most outspoken champion.

[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.600]
His intentions and goals were not vicious or malicious.

[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.160]
He was doing what he thought was to help to somebody that said,

[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.820]
shall live or more, hemlock of Michigan president.

[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.460]
Hemlock society.

[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.460]
They've been around a long time.

[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.440]
Back in the old days when we used to do those boring interviews on talk shows,

[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.900]
there was always somebody from the hemlock society on, like at least once a week.

[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.480]
And of course, again, like I said in Florida, this is a perfect place for it.

[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.580]
The not dead yet crowd, we need them.

[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.440]
Not dead yet, but getting closer by the second.

[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.920]
Got the city link in front of you, by the way.

[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.220]
The annual best of, we already did the new times about a month ago.

[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.840]
And now we have the city link.

[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.940]
That should kill some good time today, especially Susan Barardi's choice.

[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.420]
Now, what does she do over there?

[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.340]
This is one of the staff members who also make their picks.

[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.560]
Yes.

[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.600]
What does she do?

[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.540]
She writes.

[00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.960]
writes what?

[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.720]
Crap of our French Canadians.

[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.240]
That'll take you, Susan.

[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.600]
My favorite thing in the whole thing, and boy, this station, they licked our ass.

[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.500]
In fact, we all have a sore rectum today just because of the ass looking from the city link.

[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.540]
Which we thank them for profusely, by the way.

[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.440]
Even though the reader's choice was the anxious at best, we'll get to that.

[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.940]
Well, I guess you must have voted on that.

[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.700]
You like Castor Nova.

[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.460]
I do.

[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.380]
Yeah.

[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.400]
About as much as you like to get perimeter.

[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.900]
No, I like Castor Nova much, much more.

[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.400]
Oh, okay.

[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.920]
I like I said.

[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.600]
But my favorite one of the whole deal, and I have to temper the thing about pizza law.

[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.500]
Because he gets too much free publicity anyway, Jeff.

[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.840]
And yes, they did pick him as the best pizza in, where is it?

[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:50.680]
In Southwest Broward between 595 and Griffin Road on the west side, on the east side, whatever side.

[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.420]
No, certainly they got a category here for best pizzas.

[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.460]
I mean, I guess they must have a lot of people advertising in the city link in this rack.

[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:05.700]
They got best pizza in Fort Lauderdale, Louis, Louis, best for Hollywood, Southeast, Broward, Capone, Flickr Life, best for Southwest Broward, pizza law.

[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:14.460]
Best in West Broward, La Torreta, best place for pizza in Northwest Broward, pizza time, best place on your block, Rosa and Pasquale's in Northeast.

[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:22.200]
I mean, you know, so as much as we love ponytail, and we're delighted for him that he got the recognition there by city link.

[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.960]
I wouldn't get to a side of it.

[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.060]
In fact, were there any pizza places that didn't get best of within the two block radius?

[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.340]
No.

[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:39.200]
But my favorite of all the food reviews in here is because I agree wholeheartedly, best place for steak expensive in Broward, Ruth's Kris steakhouse.

[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.860]
Oh, yeah.

[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.800]
I could just move in there, you know what?

[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.040]
I love that place.

[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.920]
I'm just obsessed with Ruth's Kris.

[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.600]
In fact, I'm going there this weekend.

[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.260]
Instead of going out, this is a tough choice.

[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:58.340]
Instead of going to the Panther game on Saturday against Tampa Bay Saturday night, which of course is a good excuse not to be able to take somebody who he'll be working

[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.200]
one of your favorite people that night will be televising the game.

[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.620]
One of your very favorite people in the world.

[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.520]
I told him yesterday, I said, oh, we're going to Ruth's Kris Saturday, but I forgot you can't go.

[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.940]
You're doing that stupid hockey game.

[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:09.960]
Can't go.

[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.880]
Oh, damn it.

[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.600]
Well, we're still going anyway.

[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.880]
Through Ruth's Kris.

[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:20.760]
It says, if you enjoy corn fed Midwestern USDA Prime V if you're going to pay dearly for the Ruth's Kris, that much is certain.

[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:27.860]
And since high end steak houses offer only all a card menus, you'll pay for appetizers, salads, potatoes, and vegetables, not to mention dessert.

[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.360]
Who each deserves you guys?

[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:36.300]
Stakes are brought with 1800 degrees and served with butter on heated plates for that extra sizzle and supplementary dose of cholesterol.

[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.860]
It says, whichever Ruth does, doesn't understand the whole cholesterol thing, which I'll get to.

[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:46.680]
The petite fillet is the least expensive at 21.95, people on cost 29.95, Porterhouse for two will sit you back 58 bucks.

[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:53.820]
And it goes on, man, it says, good yes, expensive yes, worth it, you decide.

[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.540]
Yeah, it's worth it.

[00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:02.100]
And then some, even if you're paying yourself, and if somebody else is paying, or if they're picking up the tab, it's really well worth it.

[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.660]
By the way, getting back to those advantage bars, I'll get to that in a second.

[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.400]
I apologize profusely if anybody went out and bought those yesterday.

[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:10.520]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.920]
I'll never say that again.

[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.840]
In fact, I'm going to, I'm going to really go nuts on those things today.

[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:23.320]
At the great expense, at the great risk of pissing off my good friend Dr. Bob Atkins, your advantage bars blow.

[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:31.780]
Okay, they blow, they suck, get them off the market before other people want to nauseous with high blood sugar of 200, by the way.

[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.660]
But I'll get into that. Got a lot of good crap for you today.

[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.020]
Of course, the draft, that's the big topic.

[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:42.040]
My favorite call in the morning, the guy that guy John, I called depot and was ripping the ass, I enjoyed that part of it.

[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.540]
But then he gets to this thing, you understand depot, what you don't want to understand.

[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.140]
Most people care about the draft.

[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:55.060]
And I went, yeah, about the NFL draft, not about drafting, you know, kids to send to you with sloppy.

[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.040]
Your mornings will never be the same.

[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:06.100]
Starting this Monday on 560 WQAM, it's the morning mayor, Herb Oscar Anderson.

[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.980]
Now follow again.

[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.840]
Here's my best of you.

[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.320]
Are you guys all praying?

[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.540]
I'm all scared.

[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:23.200]
Wake up, your Oscar Anderson, Monday, Group Friday, 6 p.m.

[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.020]
Only on 560 WQAM.

[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.260]
Clean up, clean up the brown thing in your underwear.

[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.020]
Clean up, clean up, put on a thousand hairs.

[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:43.240]
Clean up, clean up the cumstrings right here on your seat.

[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.840]
Clean up, clean up whenever you eat your meat.

[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.360]
Clean up, clean up, try some dune shit works, but back.

[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.880]
Clean up, clean up whenever you have that.

[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.320]
Okay, that's the end of 560 WQAM.

[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.060]
Let's take a quick poll here on this, okay?

[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.360]
Quick, instant poll, screen list, don't answer them.

[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.140]
5607 0560, our poll question, you care about the NFL draft,

[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.080]
and part two, should we do another hockey show with Rimmer?

[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.120]
Now, why are you making a face like that?

[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.000]
I think you might be surprised at the outcome of this poll, huh?

[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:17.180]
No.

[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.220]
You care about the draft, and you want to hear another hockey show

[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.880]
with the voice of the Panthers, Jeff Rimmer, and all those people that we used to have on.

[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.460]
Which is your just 5607 0560, count 560 on a mobile one line.

[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:29.560]
WQAM.

[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.060]
Jeff Rimmer and all of them.

[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.320]
Hello, yes, sir.

[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.580]
Yeah, so it's going to do the poll?

[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.700]
Yeah, you care about the draft?

[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.000]
Okay, you couldn't even get the words out.

[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.840]
Yeah, you want to do the right, okay?

[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.700]
I want to have an eye, okay.

[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.160]
You're hired, put them on the weekends.

[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:47.340]
WQAM.

[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.740]
No way, baby, I have a life.

[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.100]
I guess that was done both, does that what you saying?

[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:53.780]
Yeah, both.

[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.080]
WQAM.

[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:56.540]
Hello, poll.

[00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.680]
Yes, the draft is for idiots, and keep Rimmer off the air.

[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.080]
Okay.

[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.860]
Oh, come on.

[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.540]
See, and I'm not going to say that you put me up to this, but you didn't.

[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.420]
This is my own idea.

[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:10.880]
WQAM.

[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.180]
In the words of Buffalo Bill?

[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:13.820]
No.

[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.220]
I'm both.

[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.420]
Thank you.

[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.680]
I guess you meant no.

[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:18.140]

[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:19.720]
WQAM.

[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.160]
Hey, George.

[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:21.580]
Yes?

[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.420]
Oh, Neil.

[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.360]
Yes, oh, Neil.

[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.360]
Hey, Neil, Neil.

[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:29.440]
Oh, my god, I remember the IOT days when they would pretty much shut the damn radio station down

[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.000]
just to do a live draft coverage.

[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.640]
You remember that, Fiat?

[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.160]
Yes, I do.

[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.480]
You know, I do not ever want to hear, see or smell the draft again.

[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.300]
Okay, and Rimmer?

[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.200]
You can.

[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:38.520]
Rimmer?

[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.500]
Hey, he has a good job.

[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.120]
What can I say?

[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.620]
But, should we do a hockey show?

[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:43.840]
You know what?

[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:49.160]
I hate to say it, but even though I love to hear you talk about it, I'm kind of sick of hockey myself.

[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:49.860]
Okay, thank you.

[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.240]
I guess that was a...

[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:51.400]
No.

[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.320]
Come on, does anybody want to hear a hockey show with Rimmer?

[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:54.500]
No.

[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:55.400]
Huh?

[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.360]
WQAM.

[00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.520]
No draft.

[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.120]
Don't care about the draft.

[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:01.340]
Yes.

[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.480]
And Rimmer, but don't share your...

[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:04.720]
Okay.

[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:05.740]
Okay.

[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.660]
Sounds like sour grapes to me.

[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:08.760]
WQAM.

[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.020]
No.

[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.360]
No way, no, I'm not in New York.

[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.120]
Not in other words.

[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:14.400]
Okay.

[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:16.760]
What are they trying to say?

[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.040]
No.

[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:17.460]

[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.520]
56670560, PON 560, the Automobile One Limerty, an instant pull.

[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.700]
You care about the NFL draft.

[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.340]
You want to hear any more about...

[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.000]
Did you have a life where you care about the draft?

[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.840]
So you're in spite of what that John Asshole said there were depots this morning?

[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.620]
Most of us care about...

[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.020]
No, the sports nerds, they care about the draft.

[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.260]
Those are the only people that give a flying fart about the draft, okay?

[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.220]
But a hockey show with Rimmer?

[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.000]
WQAM.

[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.040]
No, and hell, no.

[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:45.780]
Okay, thank you.

[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:49.960]
WQAM.

[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.440]
No, no, not that.

[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.060]
Okay, I think they're a little hostile about the second part of this question, you know what?

[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.240]
I think they're a little bit psychotic about it.

[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.220]
Well, I think back to those shows.

[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:00.720]
WQAM.

[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.220]
And there.

[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.280]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.360]
Yes, I'm looking forward to listening to the draft.

[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.120]
I'm not going to be in front of my TV set, but I will be listening.

[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:09.540]
Yes.

[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.320]
And no to Rimmer.

[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.480]
Okay, thank you.

[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.560]
So there's a lady who does care about the draft, but still don't want to hear Rimmer.

[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.540]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.020]
Oh, so the draft is leading Rimmer by one.

[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.000]
That's, I mean, that's a shot, you know?

[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:27.640]
That's unbelievable.

[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.400]
I'd be depressed here in that.

[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.180]
WQAM.

[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.720]
Uh, yes, Neil.

[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.180]
Yes sir.

[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:33.620]

[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.180]
No squared, okay, thank you.

[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.460]
Wonder what Peter Marshall would say about that.

[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.200]
WQAM.

[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.620]
A hell-boggled in the draft, and I'll take Rimmer and Peter Bondra's spot.

[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:43.500]
Okay.

[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:45.640]
WQAM.

[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.740]
The draft blows in Soda's Rimmer.

[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.440]
Oh!

[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.760]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.680]
What do they try to say, huh?

[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:54.900]
Oh.

[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.100]
Is that what they're trying to say?

[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.260]
WQAM.

[00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.620]
Yes, no.

[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.120]
Yes, no.

[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:01.880]
Yes, no.

[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.000]
Yes, stop.

[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:02.580]
In that order?

[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:03.280]
Right.

[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.020]
Okay, thank you.

[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.080]
That was good.

[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.220]
Yes, no.

[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:06.560]
Good.

[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:07.500]
Good job, sir.

[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.560]
WQAM.

[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.480]
No, no more ring jobs.

[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:12.020]
Okay.

[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:13.700]
WQAM.

[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.940]
Uh, no, and yes.

[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.120]
Yes?

[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:17.960]
Yes?

[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.920]
Like Rimmer.

[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.420]
Maybe they'll talk about Satan.

[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:21.760]
This is Rimmer.

[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:23.600]
Is this Rimmer?

[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:25.860]
This is...

[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.340]
I'm not...

[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:26.480]
Rimmer.

[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.200]
Yeah, this is Rimmer.

[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:27.840]
You're not fooling.

[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.180]
Not Rimmer.

[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.780]
Okay, I'll talk to you later, Rimmer.

[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.800]
That was him doing a voice, wasn't it?

[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:32.260]
Or was that...

[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.520]
He was either Don Johnson or Rimmer.

[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.700]
Okay, that right now.

[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:37.380]
WQAM.

[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:39.620]
WQAM.

[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:40.540]
Hello?

[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.480]
Uh, speaking ill.

[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.060]
Speaking.

[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.840]
Oh, no, and bring that Tony for hockey.

[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.180]
Bring back who?

[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:49.740]
Sonny.

[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.460]
Well, I wouldn't...

[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.840]
I mean, that's a shot, you know?

[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.380]
When they said they'd rather have a dead man doing the games?

[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:57.920]
WQAM.

[00:15:59.100 --> 00:15:59.400]
Hi.

[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:00.620]
Hello?

[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:01.080]
Yes.

[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.160]
I am still here.

[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:02.620]
Okay.

[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.620]
Yes, do you want to care about the NFL draft?

[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:06.720]
Hell no.

[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.520]
And you want to hear a hockey show with Jeff?

[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.880]
I would rather hear Joey Reynolds than I'd rather hear Rimmer.

[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.940]
And you'd rather be dead than here Joey Reynolds, right?

[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.340]
Oh, I loved Joey.

[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.080]
I love it.

[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:16.220]
Joey's coming.

[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.900]
Joey's starting Monday morning as a matter of fact.

[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.260]
All right.

[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.420]
Okay, thank you.

[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.680]
So she doesn't want to hear Rimmer with a hockey show.

[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.040]
She wants to hear Joey Reynolds.

[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:26.900]
Oh, man.

[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.680]
That's unbelievable.

[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.000]
You know why Joey's coming back?

[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.740]
I have my nose up kneels and ask.

[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.660]
That's the answer, right?

[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:35.800]
WQAM.

[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:36.900]
Hi there.

[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:37.840]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.980]
Okay, the last time I cared about a draft, it was one that was blowing up my skirt.

[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:42.840]
It sounds like the nun.

[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:43.480]
The erst nun.

[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:45.240]
Yeah, it is.

[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:45.920]
Oh, I said a nun.

[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.360]
No hockey either.

[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.900]
You can talk about hockey.

[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:50.760]
Yeah, but no Rimmer.

[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:51.480]
No Rimmer.

[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:51.960]
Okay.

[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.000]
God bless you.

[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.580]
Even the erst nun don't want to hear him.

[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.140]
I don't want to make him feel bad, but he was giving me a bunch of crappiestes today.

[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.900]
So, paranoid inside Cotta.

[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:01.980]
Oh, you're a rip of me.

[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.020]
Well, the seats were bad.

[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.000]
Rimmer, there were terrible seats.

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.980]
There were a million miles away, you know?

[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.360]
And I have no problem that I could see you handing it up up there in a press box for my benefit.

[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.440]
I have no problem with that.

[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.400]
I don't mind seeing the press box.

[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.540]
I don't really care about that.

[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.240]
They foster a Hewitt Memorial Gondola.

[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.680]
I just wanted to see the game, which if I were to get a good seats, I could have seen the game.

[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.900]
And I would have probably been within, you know, see the problem in my section was,

[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.600]
the reason I finally figured it out, the reason the people were so combitose,

[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.920]
they're so far away, they couldn't really see what was going on anyway.

[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.980]
So, they just figured out we'll eat some food and shmuz and walk back and forth

[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.960]
and pass our credit cards up and down and a few loonies and tunis.

[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.060]
And that's it, because we can't see what's going on out there.

[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.080]
We're too far away.

[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.380]
WQAN.

[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:44.920]
Hello?

[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:46.280]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.340]
No, I'll have to get out of Sranthell.

[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:55.420]
Okay, so we got Joey Reynolds and Alice Rantell so far over Grimoran Hockey.

[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:56.900]
WQAN.

[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.640]
I'm going to pick up Kuro.

[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.460]
Okay, thank you.

[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.140]
Oh, God, they're good.

[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.140]
WQAN.

[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.000]
Yes, yes, to the draft.

[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.480]
And I don't know who Rimmer is, but I'm rather intrigued in how he got his name.

[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.480]
And bring that micrinary.

[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.480]
Okay, okay, Riner is going to be starting Monday by the way.

[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.200]
WQAN.

[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:23.540]
Hello?

[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.720]
I say yes to RIN job and no to RIN.

[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:28.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:29.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.300]
One of your is another one.

[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.700]
That's all I care about, man.

[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:38.140]
Bracken.

[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:38.420]
Cool.

[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.080]
Cool to one dinga.

[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.180]
Those are the only two words you need.

[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.620]
No, they'll give you a driver's license to little beat a bullbrown to it.

[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.980]
You're ready to rock and roll, baby.

[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:47.380]
WQAN.

[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.700]
Yes, no.

[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.040]
Okay, thank you.

[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:51.640]
WQAN.

[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.320]
Anyone who listens to the draft get up.

[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:54.960]
Pack and write.

[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.360]
Okay.

[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.740]
Didn't stick around for the other answer, I guess.

[00:18:59.200 --> 00:18:59.640]
WQAN.

[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.540]
Yes, no to the draft.

[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.020]
Yes, I think we're good to be.

[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.160]
Okay, thank you, Ken.

[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:04.740]
Ken Block.

[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.400]
WQAN.

[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:06.700]
Hello?

[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.080]
In the native tongue of the Lexi Ocean, the yet to the draft and the yet to Rimmer.

[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:13.540]
Okay.

[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.400]
It's possible.

[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:17.260]
WQAN.

[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.480]
Neil.

[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.440]
Yeah, let Rimmer do a show on the end of our draft.

[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.340]
So keep away from hockey.

[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:24.880]
Okay, good.

[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:25.800]
Now there's an idea.

[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.800]
That's going to kill two turds with one stone.

[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:28.460]
I like that.

[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.180]
That's not bad.

[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.020]
WQAN.

[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.740]
Yeah, I, Neil.

[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:33.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:39.380]
I would say dodge the draft and no rimming allowed on your shelf.

[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.240]
Okay, thank you.

[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:41.700]
WQAN.

[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.560]
Hey, Neil, those seats weren't that bad and you couldn't beat the price.

[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.220]
Yeah.

[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.340]
Yes, for Rimmer.

[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.200]
Okay, there you go.

[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:49.940]
That was Rimmer again.

[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.300]
That's two times he's called in trying to disguise his voice.

[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.300]
WQAN.

[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:56.440]
Yes?

[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:57.640]
And yes.

[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.240]
Rimmer in a show with Dino.

[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.020]
Oh, now with Dino.

[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:02.460]
Yeah.

[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.000]
How about Rimmer with a show with Bino?

[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.500]
Dino's not feeling good.

[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.260]
How about Bino Cook?

[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.260]
You're not out of here.

[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:08.880]
See even the one.

[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.320]
They can't even do it with a straight face.

[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:11.260]
WQAN.

[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:12.540]
Neil.

[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.280]
The dolphins are going to pick K-Bit-Nound, but heck no to Rimmer.

[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.240]
Yeah, okay.

[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:18.900]
WQAN.

[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:20.700]
Hello.

[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.100]
Yes, E-Nound, myth Rimmer.

[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.120]
WQAN.

[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.440]
Yeah, it's Rimmer.

[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.860]
Bring back little Tommy Dunham Burger if he can drive.

[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.380]
WQAN.

[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.220]
Why?

[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.200]
That's what George did when we got when I got second to do those hockey shows.

[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:39.660]
Why?

[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.120]
And the whole audience would be calling up during the entire...

[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.760]
It was always around lunchtime, too, you know.

[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.200]
Not that there was anybody sucking around for a free lunch.

[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.200]
But the whole audience would be calling up screaming...

[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:52.380]
Oh, look at that.

[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.200]
That won't work anymore.

[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.480]
What is that all about?

[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.040]
Why?

[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.380]
Is he doing this?

[00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.380]
They used to get a little psychotic.

[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.100]
That's what you say.

[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.220]
Now, I have no way of knowing that.

[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.800]
I think that's just because you've got your...

[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:02.920]
What?

[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:03.860]
We're doing screenless.

[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.000]
That is sterical because he's not on.

[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:06.480]
Yeah.

[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.000]
So in other words, you're saying if we did that hockey show and he was in here?

[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.020]
Saying, I told you do a hockey show and do a lot of movies.

[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:13.180]

[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.440]
I'm not going to do the hockey show.

[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.200]
And do screenless and let him hear the people psychotic, hysterical screaming and screaming.

[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.060]
Are you going to...

[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:21.360]
Why?

[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.580]
Is he doing this?

[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.720]
What is he doing?

[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.340]
Has he lost his mind?

[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:25.900]
Yes.

[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.600]
You'll wear the dump button out in an hour.

[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.040]
Really?

[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.220]
Okay.

[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.440]
Okay, that's enough kill at pole.

[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.960]
Okay, that was, I think we finally got the message.

[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.200]
Most of these people didn't give a crap about the draft because we're going to have the real sports nerds, most of them.

[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.720]
We have some sports fans, but we don't have the real sports nerds,

[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.040]
like they have uncertain other shows on this Estacion.

[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.440]
And the remember thing was virtually unanimous except the two times he called in trying to disguise his voice.

[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.480]
I mean, how would a guy have...

[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.740]
I would anybody in the audience have known if the seats were good or bad unless they were there.

[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.800]
And there was nobody in this audience there except me and Rimmer.

[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.000]
They sucked the seats were...

[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.700]
I mean, you know, I'm not holding a grudge about that.

[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:11.700]
You know, if those hockey shows were great, I would overlook the fact that he got me really crappy garbage seats a million miles away from where he was.

[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.560]
And I would say that everything was going on.

[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:18.440]
Even after I bought him a great lunch at that great Delhi, whatever the hell name of this in downtown Toronto.

[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.100]
What's the name of it?

[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.400]
What's the name of the goddamn place I go over?

[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.020]
Well, the flower factory, I don't know.

[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.860]
The lollipop...

[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.680]
Oh my god, my mind is turning the yellow just from the notion...

[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.540]
Powderkage or something.

[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.380]
Now you've heard me tell the pickle barrel.

[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.560]
There it is. Something like that.

[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.340]
Powderkage was close.

[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.580]
which tasted like crap

[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:12.880]
to be polite

[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.220]
to be couple and we crap would be an upgrade okay to make a lot of story

[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.980]
short they start they were horrible

[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.380]
and i looked on the uh... labels there were the ingredients and it gives you

[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:27.140]
that propaganda i hope that bob link it is listening right now and maybe

[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.860]
even doctor bob and anybody else out there who's peddling

[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.700]
see the atkins died i believe in the one not losing an ounce i still weigh

[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:38.140]
exactly the same on my scale today i'm stuck there i'm going nowhere but at any

[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.100]
way

[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:44.300]
i believe in the diet but one of the time talk about marketing swill

[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.820]
he said and we have one guy yesterday calling and pretending that it was

[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.360]
probably rumor

[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.440]
pretending that he likes these there's nobody would taste that bad okay because

[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.080]
anybody ever had any of these would immediately say the worst

[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.840]
your dog your periket wouldn't touch this with its pecker okay

[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.700]
so i looked on the label and here's this crap about total carbs only two

[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.340]
grams even though it tastes like garbage

[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:11.000]
at least it's filling and it's all makes you nauseous

[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.260]
and it goes on about what what would be asterisks blister in a product of uh...

[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.420]
triglyceride fat breakdown has been omitted from the total carbide

[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.860]
raccontents is an only converts to a negligible amount of glucose in the body

[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:22.940]
well guess what doctor bob

[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:27.920]

[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:40.700]
in fact i want to public last night and the over by the deli area you know

[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.920]
where you get the stuff fresh i'd be like taking a number

[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.020]
one of the recover numbers in there at any rate back boys but seriously so i

[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.380]
they have a uh... whole thing now the new deal in my public where they have all

[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.640]
these fresh sliced up its package you know but it's their own brand

[00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:00.080]
and i and i was very careful i got stuff only that has zero card the stuff

[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.900]
that's is less than one well that's fine but maybe it's like three quarters of

[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.000]
a gram for each slice of cheese or me to wherever you need to by the time you

[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.960]
at all up you got a lot of carbohydrates here so i get the cheeses to meet

[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.960]
that they're all like that's a really great corn be

[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.960]
good stuff zero

[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.780]

maybe a couple days and then uh... some cheeses that had zero cards good stuff

[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.060]
so if you want to snack eat that stuff forget about sweet forget about all of

[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:30.840]
these things okay

[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.940]

[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.400]

[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.840]
as in g uh... they start right

[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.080]
but one of the bars maybe was the uh... first one i had yesterday

[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.260]
and we don't have the labels and more because they're long gone it had g in it

[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.040]
g-a-t-e

[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.460]
and i saw that in a dawn on me that i just read one of these books which i'm

[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.440]
going to get to admit the heart revolution by dr. kilmer mcculley

[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.060]
who writes about homo-sistine and homo a lot of homo stuff

[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.480]
and about uh...

[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:04.800]
g

[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.800]
and how it's really bad for you

[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.540]

[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:10.700]

after you eat it

[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:12.680]
and that's in there

[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.820]
so i would only doctor bob you should do a little bit better homework on the

[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.000]
stuff that they're peddling in your name because it is really it tastes like

[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.540]

[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.100]
good stuff sweetheart

[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:36.120]
just here to try to tell it like it is okay to protect you from yourself

[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.060]
to protect us from ourselves as we desperately search

lot of people in this town especially the draught next

[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.840]

right out of nowhere

[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.640]
oh my god look at that

[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.220]

for the draught next for the draft holes

[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:04.320]
hey you think the uh... where's the get a quarter back in the first round

[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:09.480]
oh man this is the time of the year brings out the real desperate was man

[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.680]
the people would know not even a semblance of a life

[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.120]
so anyway about those hockey shows

[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:18.760]
okay let's get back to this book the heart revolution by kilmer mcculley md

[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.240]
which i mentioned the last week about

[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.420]
homo cysteine

[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.600]
leave it to a homo to know about homo cysteine which i'm waiting for that test

[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.920]
result by the way

[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.720]
hey doctor mark on the yesterday was in a lot better for him i'm in the

[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.260]
worst of the day before

[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.080]
and give me some of my results uh... which are pretty good cholesterol still

[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:34.880]
a little bit high though

[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.440]
got a work on a cholesterol

[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.140]
now that i'm off at hc t that might just do it you know that goose is your

[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.180]
cholesterol up there

[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.640]
my target was arrived a drop from one twelve to ninety four i do like that

[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:45.800]
just three weeks

[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.060]
at any rate you want to hear about that

[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.500]
however speaking of all this panic about cholesterol

[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.500]
and uh... dr mcculley in the book tells you about all this uh... what i've

[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.880]
been told you for two years now this low fat revolution is a bunch of

[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.280]
bull crap

[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:04.420]
because uh... you know it's just a process garbage is what it is

[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.640]
processed crap

[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.800]
loaded with cholesterol by the way

[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:14.140]
but he says only cholesterol that contains extra oxygen atoms oxy and by

[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.760]
the way that's the which i get to a minute

[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.500]
oxy cholesterol is harmful to our arteries

[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.260]
oxy cholesterol is our creative uncertain food that process let's take the

[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.700]
classic example of eggs

[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:28.060]
the local uh... advocates have us believe in that eggs are evil we know that

[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:31.280]
egg yolks contain cholesterol which is used to make the cells and tissues

[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.760]
of the developing chick

[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.900]
in fresh eggs the cholesterol is protected from the oxygen of here by the

[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.080]
eggshell and antioxidants in the yoke eating fresh eggs

[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:44.340]
doesn't damage arteries because the cholesterol is pure but when the egg

[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:48.960]
yolks are sprayed right in the process of making powdered eggs oxy cholesterol

[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.680]
is formed

[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.300]
sprayed right at the everywhere

[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.560]
using many package food like cookies

[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.940]
crackers and other commercial prepared baked goods because they're easier to

[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.020]
handle the fresh eggs

[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:01.980]
what's worth it was the ingredients label just list them as eggs you can't even

[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.240]
tell if they're the food you're eating

[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.420]
the same goes for powdered milk which also contains oxy cholesterol the bad

[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:08.820]
ones

[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.340]
this type of cholesterol is highly damaging the arteries has been proven to

[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.440]
cause arse arterioschloradic

[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.340]
plaques

[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.140]
it's not only prepared baked goods are contained oxy cholesterol

[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.740]
fast food restaurants are havin for these deadly fed

[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.600]
typically these places

[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.860]
fry a lot of their food when chicken for instance is fried in cooking oil

[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.540]
some of its cholesterol converts to oxy cholesterol

[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:35.140]
if the cooking oil is not discarded after each use oxy cholesterol is

[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.220]
begin to build up in the world and any food cooked in it for example french

[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:38.620]
fries

[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.860]
which they put mayonnaise on by the way an Amsterdam

[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.580]
becomes liberally laced with oxy cholesterol

[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.540]
you think most fast food of food restaurants change the oil in their

[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.640]
fires after each use

[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:54.120]
if you must eat fast food restaurants avoid the fried foods altogether

[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:54.520]
says

[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.560]
now getting back to this gist up

[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:01.180]
he says the cholesterol in the cream of whole milk also becomes contaminated by

[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.520]
oxy cholesterol milk is sprayed right to make powdered milk

[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.060]
buttersons contains cholesterol is susceptible to formation of oxy cholesterol

[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.580]
if butter is heated for prolonged periods

[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:13.620]
twenty four to forty eight hours the oxygen in the surrounding air begins to

[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.700]
react to the cholesterol and butter to produce oxy cholesterol the bad stuff

[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.280]
the

[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.700]
the heated butter used in Indian cooking is a classic example

[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.480]
in a 1987 study of Indian immigrants living in London

[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.540]
an increased risk of heart disease was observed this was traced to their consumption of

[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.720]
G G H E E

[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.680]
the oxy cholesterol of G evidently was causing accelerated arteriosclerosis

[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.800]
and coronary heart disease at an early age the oxy cholesterol we eat in

[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.660]
powdered eggs fried foods heated butter and powdered milk

[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.700]
is more likely to damage arteries and cause heart disease

[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.820]
on the other hand if you fresh eggs butter milk or food saute in olive oil

[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.660]
your arteries will not be harmed for all the non-believers reading this I'll say it

[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.060]
again

[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.240]
oxy cholesterol is the only kind of cholesterol that can cause

[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.860]
artery damage he says

[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.920]
therefore if you're on a low cholesterol diet trying to reduce your heart disease

[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.380]
what matters is that you restrict your oxy cholesterol intake

[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.860]
but you know what happens at a low cholesterol diet typically people give up

[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.700]
ice cream and eat low fat cookies instead

[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.720]
a low cholesterol diet is often filled with highly processed

[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:20.980]
low fat crackers and low fat desserts that actually contain more damaging

[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.760]
oxy cholesterol and fewer nutrients that have died containing fat

[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.000]
essentially this is a prime example of why the low fat

[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.640]
low cholesterol diet doesn't work in reducing heart disease in fact it increases

[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.420]
your chances of getting the disease

[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.660]
boy says Dr. Remacoli

[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.260]
but you like that

[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.960]
so ghee which is in this product that we were eating here yesterday which is

[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.440]
supposed to be a product that's so good for you and one of the reasons by the

[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.240]
way it tastes so bad

[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.180]
if you look on the ingredients it's got all these vitamins that's what has

[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.720]
that kind of like medicinal awful nasty stale taste to it

[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.120]
see I can take my vitamins and I do a lot of them

[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.900]
in a pill and so can anybody else in fact a doctor is always recommending

[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.560]
doctor records all these things he's got that megabyte of

[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.480]
nutrient that new book is all the stuff that he wants you to take fine

[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.840]
but don't put in a goddamn food bar

[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.860]
huh I mean when I have my great stake in root script I want them to put a

[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.920]
whole bunch of vitamin E and panathetic acid and stick that in the

[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.860]
stake while they're cooking it I don't think so

[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:28.040]
I'd rather hear a hockey show first before I do that and I would rather die

[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:31.120]
than do another one of those awful hockey show they start oh they were bad

[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:34.700]
we were just reminiscing about how every time we get into that stuff during the

[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.460]
hockey season time of year the trend would come out and it would be

[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.900]
in the crapper ratings would take a dive in fact that would be another good

[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.720]
instant pull right now all the people they've veterans of this show who used to

[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.880]
listen to iod when we did those hockey shows since we've never done one here

[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.960]
have we we don't want to hear no oh thank god I finally wise up

[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.300]
what was that time I had off chance to clear my brain out you know

[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.140]
or maybe there's a chance in the in the Eden Center some of that cleared my

[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:03.700]
brains out a little bit came to my senses so if there's any people out there that

[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:07.380]
turned it off and got upset when rumor was on on iod and turn the station off

[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.560]
let's do a couple of minutes of that and find out I could be wrong five six seven

[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.020]
oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one I'll get them don't mind you

[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.100]
do why are you doing that that's bad this is another one of our stories

[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:20.360]
instant polls you saw the tremendous reaction we had to that

[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:24.060]
I mean I don't want to be a dead horse but I'm just I'm wondering if what you're saying

[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:28.240]
is an exaggeration if people actually turned this show off if it was detrimental to

[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.660]
this show when we did that those shows in iod we want to hear about it because

[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:35.620]
obviously it's my livelihood I can't afford to hurt the show just to give

[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:40.940]
somebody else's ego a big boost and a free lunch wqa am I like to have to show

[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:53.360]
so speaking about beyond the boundaries here's the press the oh we got another break

[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:59.120]
haha haha haha haha well i can't afford to get any further behind i apologize it's turned our

[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:03.360]
shoulder pure instant crap today because the audio vault cracked out and we don't have a backup

[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.060]
one like we used to a paxon because this cheap passoff it can only afford one first one unit

[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:13.300]
per studio that's why guilty is on and around that morning show they don't want to have too many

[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:18.980]
units in out of that studio and he hasn't had one but uh so unlike the paxon people want you know

[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:23.740]
paxon was an asshole and he still is and a phony baloney and a goody two shoes and destroyed

[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:30.420]
everything in his wake but at least they spent money we had equipment there that nobody needed nobody

[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:35.520]
ever heard of nobody knew how it worked but we had it if they invented it we had here it's like

[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.880]
uh uh like this great car machine we got over here let me let me do anybody want to buy a car

[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:44.340]

[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:42.960]
5500 people if there were a thousand people there last night it was a lot and guess what they're

[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:48.160]
trying to get them to do in Montreal build a new stadium for them downtown and speaking of Joe

[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:52.260]
Rosen the San Francisco Giants I saw about two minutes of that game last night and they pan through

[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:58.360]
the crowd the crowd the crowd were all in disguises invisible people's red seats they were in

[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:03.980]
disguise that you couldn't complain about the crowd there because there wasn't any and they're

[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:10.200]
building a new stadium downtown there's a story oh

[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:11.780]
if there's a

[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.840]
I'm gonna take off my shoes

[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.440]
drip off my dress

[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:22.280]
it makes me wet when I see you get a big ira

[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:22.900]
rags

[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.760]
uh that's too big for my mouth

[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:32.820]
I want it mercenary and a top of you and take it up my lubricated food

[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.800]
okay give me an ira

[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:36.260]
examined

[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.960]
see

[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:38.440]
people

[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:21.880]
We don't know what that was, that popping clicking, clicking, clicking, clicking, clicking,

[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:24.580]
well the audience started to get used to it, they were listening to QA, I mean of course

[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:28.660]
even when we don't have a technical problem there's a lot of popping and clicking going on.

[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:32.460]
Before I get to the city link stuff, which you'll kill, that are to kill about five, six hours,

[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:36.480]
I think they have to wait. Here's a story that certainly didn't get much publicity,

[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:40.460]
thank God, and it was buried way down on the bottom of the page in the Scum Centrelus morning

[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:43.860]
on the inside page two or three. Oh there it is again, now I'm starting to get concerned,

[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.720]
did you hear that? Did you hear that popping puke there, whatever that was?

[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:53.320]
What the hell was that? Wait a minute, listen carefully. There it is again.

[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:58.540]
Oh, seriously, it's popping and puke-ing time here at QAM. Well listen, just plot ahead, okay?

[00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:02.100]
Just plot ahead, we don't have time to stop, we gotta make sure we get all the spots in.

[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:08.240]
Simpson slightly injured, in Tussle with gunman is the headline on the story here,

[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.420]
and of course the Simpson they're talking about is none other than-

[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:11.960]
Oh man.

[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:20.660]
Oh Jay. Los Angeles, oh Jay Simpson was slightly injured on Tuesday when he struggled with a gunman KCBS TV reported.

[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.640]
Damn it, who bad the gunman didn't, I didn't know how this was thinking.

[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:28.780]
Simpson hand was cut by the barrel of the gun during the afternoon incident,

[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.660]
which took place in Griffith Park after he had played golf.

[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.980]
Playing a lot of golf there with those bad arthritic knees, aren't you, OJ huh?

[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.340]
You know what I'm saying? Oh man.

[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:38.240]
Yeah, murdering bastard.

[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:42.040]
The attacker came out with the gun and tried to get me to go with him,

[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:46.960]
and we wrestled Simpson told the TV station. Simpson said he bit the assailant.

[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:51.960]
He pulled a marv Albert on the assailant during the attack, and then tried to chase him in his car.

[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.640]
Oh, there he goes again. Another one of those highway chases.

[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.360]
Sounds familiar to me, isn't it?

[00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:00.580]
He was talking to Burbank police on his phone at the time.

[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.600]
Oh boy, doesn't this all take us back?

[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:06.100]
But officers told him to end the chase and cut the crap is what they said.

[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.360]
And he went, oh man.

[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:07.720]
Yeah.

[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:15.040]
Probably staged the whole goddamn thing, and all he made here in the papers here was way down on the bottom of the page and that nobody reads.

[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:17.100]
Damn it.

[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:22.100]
I mean, anybody with a gun that got that close to OJ obviously would take care of this.

[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:27.780]
Okay, getting to a city like magazine, by the way, in their yearly best of worst of it,

[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.260]
they don't do the worst, do they?

[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.080]
Like a new times.

[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.840]
Well, you know, the Broward thing.

[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:38.820]
First, the reader's choices, okay? The reader's choice, and I don't understand really what this is all about.

[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:42.160]
They've only got about seven categories. They've got 50,000 categories inside.

[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:44.220]
Now, the readers, I don't know what this means.

[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:50.580]
Readers' choice, waitress, best waitress, Rosie O'Neill at Creoleen is in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:51.600]
Do you ever hear of Rosie O'Neill?

[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:51.800]
No.

[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:52.660]
Do you ever hear of Creoleen?

[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:52.940]
No.

[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.240]
Best bartender, Dar, at Rosie, baby in Lauderdale.

[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:56.920]
Do you ever hear of Dar?

[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.680]
I remember we used to go to track with a guy named Dar and Michigan years ago.

[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.600]
Historical TV newscaster, of course, Rick Sanchez.

[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.380]
Best local radio personality.

[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.440]
This is the reader's choice.

[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.600]
Obviously, you stopped the box.

[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.000]
Paul Castronova.

[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.160]
I almost couldn't get it out.

[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:16.060]
God, local musical performer, Tony Bishop, local artist, Stan Street,

[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.400]
and government official Nancy Graham.

[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.480]
Ever heard of those last three?

[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:19.740]
No.

[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:20.400]
None of the above.

[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:21.240]
Never heard of one of them.

[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.300]
Paul Castronova, ever heard of him?

[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:23.600]
No.

[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:23.920]
No.

[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.900]
Okay, now we get into the city link picks.

[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.660]
First before we get into their picks though, in all these different categories,

[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.280]
since they, they lick, maybe that's what we're hearing.

[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:38.340]
Honor monitors, we're hearing the sound of the lucky, lucky sounds from the city link staff

[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.540]
over there who love us to pieces.

[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.820]
What ever happened to that Howard Beel guy, by the way?

[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.460]
Used to write all that great stuff in city link?

[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:48.720]
Oh, and before I get to your good friend, Susan Barardi, by the way, George,

[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:53.420]
before I get to that, among the categories, I'm looking through all the dining places,

[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:58.720]
and best pizza, and best Italian, and bestest, the best place for dessert and brow art.

[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.340]
Not thought I'm in the market for desserts, I can't eat it, but I just had a curiosity of

[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:03.640]
because the name caught my attention.

[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:09.560]
A place called the Tea Room, a 21 East Los Olas Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:14.800]
Because I mean, I know a lot of you out there on Las Olas in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.620]
When you go to the tea room, I know what you're looking for.

[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.060]
You're looking for glory holes!

[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:20.200]
Right, which George has never seen one, by the way, in his life.

[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:27.440]
The name of the place is the Tea Room, and it's the best place for dessert.

[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:31.820]
I bet you're Peter Clayton, the late great restaurant reviewer, Peter Clayton would probably agree.

[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:37.760]
I wouldn't be surprised if he got a few desserts in the tea rooms of this community over the years,

[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:40.900]
but that's another story, which is too close to lunch today, that story.

[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.940]
Okay, getting back to Susan Barardi.

[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.740]
Now, who is she? She writes for a city-length.

[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:45.320]
Yes.

[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.360]
And we know her from marketing magic.

[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.920]
She used to work there when we were in a factory building with them, yes.

[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:50.260]
Right.

[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:51.140]
Did I know her?

[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:52.160]
No.

[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:53.120]
You've seen her.

[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:54.520]
Well, her picture is right here.

[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:55.060]

[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:55.960]
Hi, Susan!

[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:56.820]
Bitch!

[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:59.260]
So anyway, we talked about her.

[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:02.660]
George tells me several weeks ago, or not that long ago, because she wrote an article,

[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.640]
or written in the French Canadiens, and she got an...

[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:05.440]
Just got one line.

[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:06.000]

[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:08.120]
Well, that's right now, remember?

[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.040]
She just gave him a shot.

[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.880]
Passing in her aim was to have been out of shape those frogs.

[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:14.460]
So now, I get to have...

[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:18.000]
In the midst of this thing here today, this gigantic issue with all their best stuff,

[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:24.400]
they allowed the staff, also, along with their own editors, who ever wrote the other stuff.

[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:25.700]
The staff makes their picks.

[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:29.240]
So Susan gives about a half a dozen different things here.

[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.500]
Best bumper sticker, mean people suck.

[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.800]
That's the best bumper sticker, mean people suck.

[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:37.160]
That's weak.

[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:38.980]
That's really weak.

[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.160]
But anyway, this always this.

[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.240]
Best radio personality, Neil Rogers.

[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:47.500]
Rogers wins by default based purely on the lack of choices, Susan says.

[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:52.240]
Besides, the real reason behind this pick is Rogers producer George Rodriguez.

[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:53.920]
He's a friend and a good guy.

[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.500]
To which you're so embarrassed that you're not even going to say that.

[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.960]
Oh, no, now he's looking in the DCS for some...

[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:03.620]
Thanks, Sue.

[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:04.600]
Yeah, thanks, Sue.

[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:05.840]
I'm not...

[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.360]
I think what you were looking for was probably...

[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:09.140]
That fucking bitch.

[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.680]
I would have fit in real good for Sue.

[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.280]
Okay.

[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.280]
What do you want, Sam?

[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:17.940]
What do you want?

[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.840]
Don't wink at me, okay? You're not my type, Drew.

[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:21.340]
What do you want?

[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:23.220]
Who wants to talk to you?

[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:23.620]
Okay.

[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.140]
You want to stay verbal in a course with you.

[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:27.280]
If he's going to do a lot of those van hits, okay?

[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.140]
Tell him to...

[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:29.260]
Hit this. We're not interested.

[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:30.400]
Okay.

[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.860]
So now we get to the Nitty-Gritty.

[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.560]
Now we get to the big categories here.

[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.640]
Best TV anchor.

[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:37.540]
City-Link magazine says,

[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:38.460]
Rick Sanchez.

[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:39.800]
Channel 7.

[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:41.440]
We know what you're thinking.

[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.020]
Rick Sanchez, are you people joking?

[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:45.000]
He makes a mockery of local TV news.

[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:46.220]
Exactly it says.

[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:50.060]
We've given up pretending that our local loses anything but a noisy shrill freak show.

[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:52.260]
A breathless blow-dried posers,

[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:59.120]
shamelessly grabbing us by the lapels with exaggerated readings of any story that comes with a lace garter or yellow police tape wrapped around it.

[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:03.800]
Who better to embody this low-brow pandemic to our baser instincts than Rick Sanchez,

[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.660]
who we suspect will be squatting over South Florida?

[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:08.500]
Where do they get that line, I wonder?

[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.400]
For as long as WSBN Channel 7 will allow.

[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:12.340]
How do you like that?

[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:17.620]
He'll be squatting over South Florida as they continue stealing material from this show.

[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:20.620]
I already have a homosexual relationship with NEO,

[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:22.320]
so I might as well have one with you too.

[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.820]
Best TV reporter, Michael Putney.

[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:25.420]
Oh boy.

[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:29.080]
That must have been before that Cuba thing, you know, before that baseball game that Mr. Riteness.

[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:37.800]
He's a good guy, Michael, but, uh, oh god, just shameless pandering, bending over backward, doing summer solts, backflips pandering.

[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.300]
So on that one.

[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:43.780]
Best TV weather person, Amy Murphy on Channel 7.

[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:44.540]
Do I know who that is?

[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:44.920]
No.

[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:47.260]
I have no idea who that is.

[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.800]
I thought I knew every weather fairy, every weather person in this town.

[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.460]
Do I have any clue who Amy Murphy is?

[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:53.600]
No.

[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:54.760]
In fact, it's interesting.

[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:55.760]
They're obsessed with that.

[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:58.260]
I'd like to the city like people who watch any of the other channels,

[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:01.380]
because best hair on TV news, Belkies Nere.

[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:05.800]
It's a good thing they didn't have a category for best name of the TV people,

[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:09.440]
because Belkies Nere certainly, uh, oh man.

[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:15.680]
It's more like a feathered skull cap, really, but Belkies Nere pixie do

[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.140]
is a welcome counterpoint to the helmet heads and big, bad looking,

[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:23.600]
Dan O'Wave that march across our TV screens like shampoo, soap, Jesse Briggs Nightmare.

[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:27.160]
No rollers, no setting gel, no big blow dry mousse on the loose.

[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:31.980]
Belkies is a great looking 90s version of an N-E-Rexic young Liza Manelli,

[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:34.780]
who sets the craftier pace for the no nonsense.

[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.740]
This is just in the newsroom kind of reporting.

[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.420]
Can you believe this?

[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:39.680]
No.

[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:41.100]
She's a freak show.

[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:44.000]
I'd like Marilyn Mitchell with a cat eyes.

[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:48.520]
Mine eyes have never seen anything like that.

[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:48.720]
No.

[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:49.260]
In my life.

[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:50.540]
Okay, now we get to the good stuff.

[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.700]
Okay, after they're licking over with Channel 7,

[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.540]
I think the reason being that we used to work over there.

[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:57.460]
And by the way, I drove by the way, the doctor a couple days ago on Monday.

[00:59:58.140 --> 00:59:59.940]
Is there anything in that old IOD building?

[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:00.500]
Do we know?

[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:01.620]
Boxes.

[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.560]
Does anybody know?

[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:03.220]
Huh?

[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.600]
There's nothing in there?

[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.020]
This goes to show you when you have that much money,

[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:09.880]
how dangerous you are.

[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.920]
When Paxton bought IOD, he also bought that old building.

[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:14.940]
Even though we weren't going to have a radio station in there,

[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.440]
they bought the building not having any idea what they were going to do with it.

[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:19.720]
And it's just sitting there.

[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:22.580]
So I'm a sous- I don't- I can't assume anything.

[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:25.080]
Maybe when they sold a clear channel IOD and all their radio off,

[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.800]
maybe they sold in that building or maybe not.

[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:28.100]
Does anybody have the answer?

[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:28.620]
Who knows?

[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.480]
So it's just sitting there.

[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.220]
Just sitting there is like an appendage to Channel 7 on the 7th answer,

[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:35.820]
which is because way.

[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.380]
Anybody know the answer?

[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.760]
Okay, now let's get to the good stuff.

[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:42.160]
Okay, best TV sportscaster.

[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:45.880]
85 guesses in the first 84 don't count.

[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.560]
Hank Goldberg, yes, PN.

[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:49.580]
That was funny.

[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.500]
Except for Channel 10's football intensive sports jam,

[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.680]
Hank Goldberg doesn't do much local TV,

[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:58.380]
which is too bad because his ultra informed and gambler friendly insights

[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.560]
will sharply improve any area sports cast.

[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.400]
That's what Joe Castello says.

[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:08.320]
Instead, the hammer covers the competition as an at large NFL reporter for ESPN,

[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:12.080]
which thanks to the not- see, we're going along fine now,

[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.500]
but again, another mistake.

[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:15.340]
Too many mistakes in this town.

[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:19.800]
Can anybody write anything in a paper and a rag and a handout without making mistakes?

[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:20.220]

[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.580]
ESPN, which thanks to the well-sourced Goldberg,

[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.860]
first broke the Jimmy Johnson isn't quitting after all story.

[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.060]
Were they the first ones to break that story?

[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:31.420]
No.

[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.300]
Hank Goldberg broke the story, all right,

[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:40.000]
but it was on the near Rogers show on QAM minutes before they had it on ESPN.

[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.400]
How do you like that?

[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.280]
CityLink, and they like me at CityLink,

[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.640]
but they still can't get it right.

[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:52.740]
It says locals get Goldberg's scoops from 2 to 6 p.m. each Monday through Friday on WQAM 560 AM.

[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.060]
All we can say to that is, hey, stupid!

[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:56.500]
Yeah.

[01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.260]
Get it right.

[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.160]
Just once I'd like to pick up a paper.

[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.400]
I'd like to even pick up a piece of toilet paper and look on there and read something that was accurate in this town.

[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.360]
On and on.

[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.840]
It goes as the misinformation just keeps going around and around.

[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:12.020]
And of course here it doesn't make any difference.

[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:13.960]
I'll see you, good.

[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.080]
1132 at 560 WQ AM.

[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:21.080]
Hank Goldberg coming up at 2 has been voted the best TV sportscaster by prestigious CityLink magazine.

[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:21.500]
Oh!

[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.120]
Loose paper, whatever this rag is.

[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.300]
Does anybody read this?

[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:24.620]
No.

[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.880]
Well, that's why I'm reading it to you on the air.

[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:26.600]
Kill some good time.

[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.380]
And you're interested?

[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.340]
They're all interested in this, aren't they?

[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:29.700]
Uh-huh.

[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:30.500]
But you're sweet ass.

[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.020]
Wait till they hear who gets best radio sportscaster.

[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:35.900]
I'll give you one hint, okay?

[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:36.500]
All right.

[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:37.120]
There you go.

[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.220]
See, what did I tell you?

[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.800]
Haven't I always been right on top of this?

[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.420]
This man is a genius.

[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:42.400]
He's a panic.

[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.360]
He's off the wall.

[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:44.380]
He's certifiable.

[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.800]
He's crazier than a bed bug.

[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.080]
Our very own.

[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:47.720]
Yes!

[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:48.840]
G-a-man witch.

[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:54.360]
It says he can be loud, obnoxious and sexist, and he couldn't care less about most of anything but the dolphins.

[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:55.840]
The dolphins and all of you had the dolphins.

[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:01.560]
But in spite of, and perhaps because of, his narrow-minded sensibility, no one on the sports dial

[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:06.320]
is as entertaining as passionate, as honest, as brash, or as funny, as the mad dog.

[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:11.000]
And no one appears to be having as much fun talking about the game's department of sound

[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.360]
Florida life as the former dolphins tied in.

[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:18.080]
Also, unlike a lot of ex-jocs who have no business sitting behind a microphone, Mandice has

[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:22.680]
learned the craft of his profession which makes him all right as they talk host.

[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.680]
That's what it says with the 7Ws and...

[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:25.660]
Exactly.

[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.360]
Oh right.

[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.380]
There's here one the whole past thing here off the show.

[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.120]
As a talk host and color commentator on dolphins radio broadcast.

[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:33.660]
Right up.

[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:34.880]
There you go.

[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:38.180]
Best suck up sports announcer.

[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.480]
I'm assuming they're talking about the TV people by the way.

[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.320]
It says all of them.

[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:46.500]
When to last time we saw any of our esteemed local sportscasters get under the skin of the people they cover.

[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:51.260]
The giant sucking sound, Ross Perot, once referred to when he arrived about NAFTA,

[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:57.740]
is really the sound of ex-jocs and powdered pretty boys avoiding the kind of confrontational questions that usually come from journalists.

[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:04.480]
Then again, journalism of the few exceptions disappeared from local TV years ago and was never applied to much of sports anyway.

[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.440]
So don't expect that sucking sound any time soon or ever.

[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.000]
And don't forget.

[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.920]
Just a gaggy suck, okay?

[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:10.600]
Okay.

[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:12.260]
Okay.

[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.360]
Now we get to the good stuff.

[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:14.760]
Okay.

[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.800]
Best AM radio personality, of course.

[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:17.960]
Oh god!

[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:18.700]
Naturally.

[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:19.700]
Best AM radio.

[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:26.020]
Best AM personality on a station below 600 on the dial that's located in North Day between the Broward border and the...

[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:26.020]

[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.940]
I mean, best AM radio personality.

[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.080]
No, that's not exactly like a great... you know what I'm saying?

[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.520]
That's like a great pat on the back.

[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.080]
Although they do suck pretty hard.

[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:37.240]
It says, is there a better radio personality at all?

[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.860]
AM or FM in this town than the O'Rodgers?

[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:40.960]
And then it says...

[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.200]
Yes.

[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:42.100]
No, it says...

[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:42.260]
No.

[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:42.580]
Sorry.

[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:43.480]
No.

[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:48.920]
Is there anyone who can cut through our ass and eye and religious political and sexual hypocrisies better than Rodgers?

[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:49.160]
No.

[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:55.100]
Is there anyone who gives listeners the vicarious thrill of telling the boss off to stuff it better than Rodgers?

[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:55.380]
No.

[01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:01.580]
Is there anyone other than Rodgers who so rightly exposes Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura as neo-fascist blowhard?

[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:01.880]
No.

[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:03.920]
Has Rodgers ever been better?

[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:04.200]
No.

[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:05.260]
Is neo-rodgers god?

[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:05.600]
No.

[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.600]
See, that's what it meant in a mistake.

[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.140]
It says no.

[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:15.100]
But does his do no harm religion, no collection plate, no steeples, no televangelists make really good sense?

[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:15.660]
Yes.

[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:16.680]
There you go.

[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.480]
Will local AM radio be the same on Rodgers finally retires?

[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:21.740]
No.

[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:24.580]
And who the hell is the guy that says, I'm Rodgershow anyway?

[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.660]
It's Buffalo Bill, you silly people.

[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:27.900]
No.

[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:28.640]
And that's...no.

[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:29.300]
Larry King.

[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:31.160]
And that's...where is it?

[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:31.500]
Come on.

[01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:31.840]
No.

[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:32.660]
Drusy.

[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:36.380]
So there you go.

[01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:37.080]
How do you like that?

[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:37.780]
Boy, I'm telling you.

[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:40.400]
My ego is just taking a city-link magazine.

[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:45.180]
I mean, have I...is my ego...is my clocking like a peacock now?

[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:45.460]
No.

[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.980]
Now I'm still in shock about the response to those great hockey shows.

[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:50.760]
I can't believe that.

[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.920]
I think you...I think you set those people up.

[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:55.680]
He claims Rimmer was calling in over and over again.

[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.420]
I think it was George who was calling in over there.

[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.180]
He was doing his appallal windshield routine.

[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.980]
Because I know they love those hockey shows.

[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.720]
That was probably one of the great highlights.

[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.560]
One of the...what?

[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:12.400]
George says, even Foster Hewitt would turn those off if he were alive today.

[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.100]
He would turn them off.

[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:17.540]
Best FM radio personality, Howard Spurm.

[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:22.080]
Leave the hard questions to the audacious radio broadcaster and bestselling author.

[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:28.080]
Without Howard Spurm, we never know that Pamela Anderson Lee is a three-input woman

[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.040]
or that Heather Lockler excreed several times today.

[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.920]
Taking a bigger morning jolt in a double latte.

[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:37.800]
I'll see there we go again with that big double latte with your spic stuff.

[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:40.820]
The likable shock-jock is not a big thing.

[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.460]
What is it?

[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:45.120]
It's a West Coast new AG coffee thing.

[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:46.460]
Like a patino.

[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.040]
Right.

[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.900]
Which is an Italian thing that you try to steal.

[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:54.900]
The likable shock...as like I said, there they go with that West Coast pseudo-lingo.

[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:58.440]
The likable shock-jock isn't about putting himself in strange positions.

[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.820]
Like the timing, measured his penis and fell short compared to his three-man team.

[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.040]
Even Robin had a bigger penis I heard.

[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.220]
Got to love those contests too.

[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.160]
Like when one lucky girl recently got a surgical makeover courtesy of Howard

[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.360]
with sidekick Robin Quivers laughing all the way.

[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.660]
Do you have any idea what that means?

[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:16.320]
Oh.

[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.200]
And best radio DJ.

[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.600]
Freddie Cruz on Hot 105.

[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.180]
And the quiet store.

[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.620]
See, I would say Phil Henry doing Freddie Cruz would be the best radio DJ.

[01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:34.980]
And the quiet store on Hot 105.

[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:42.980]
Interesting enough, Freddie says it goes on about his bedroom voice in a soft, cool romantic mellow tone that barely breaks a whisper.

[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.280]
And Cruz says, I think they like the voice.

[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.940]
Someone talking softly to them.

[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:49.620]
Women are sensitive, man.

[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.400]
I make believe I'm whispering in her ear.

[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:52.840]
You don't have to scream.

[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.880]
I don't like a guy screaming in my ear.

[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:56.480]
I can't deal with that kind of radio.

[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:57.560]
Says Freddie Cruz.

[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.400]
He can't deal with that kind of radio.

[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.200]
Some guy screaming at him on the radio.

[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:04.060]
Well, Bafangu to you too, Freddie.

[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:05.920]
Over there it's not so hot 105.

[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.320]
I didn't realize he was on Hot 105.

[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:09.020]
Was he on Hot 105?

[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:09.300]

[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:09.860]
He was.

[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.200]
The quiet store.

[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:12.920]
I guess what?

[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.020]
I don't listen to Hot 105.

[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:14.720]
No.

[01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.280]
Anybody in this audience listening to Hot 105?

[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:17.640]
No.

[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:18.960]
That's a good question.

[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:24.620]
If we can find one person in this audience who listens to Hot 105,

[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:26.460]
we might give away a prize.

[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.120]
Not.

[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.020]
I mean, if we had a prize, we'd give him a prize.

[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:29.740]
Right?

[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.740]
I'll bet you dimes to donuts.

[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.540]
I'll bet you the cost of today's lunch, which is.

[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:37.940]
I'll bet you that much.

[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.500]
That there isn't one person in this audience who listens to Hot 105.

[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.940]
Going once, going twice,

[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:49.820]
that phone line is that board is as dead as a door nail.

[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:52.020]
Hot 105.

[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.900]
Yeah, I listen to Hot 105.

[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.460]
You listen to Hot 105?

[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:01.100]
Oh, my God.

[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:01.920]
Am I open up a jackpot?

[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:03.080]
Okay, that's our poll question.

[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.900]
Would you rather here remember to a hockey show or listen to Hot 105?

[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:08.620]

Just keep ringing it.

[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:15.660]
I think it's just set up.

[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.120]
Bob Reen got these people on the phone.

[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:18.300]

[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:25.300]
Okay.

[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:32.540]
You obnoxious foul and distasteful.

[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:35.080]
The dolphins are cursing and man,

[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:40.600]
it's distraightful because Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying.

[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.640]
They got f***ing.

[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.620]

Words of love, they tossing.

[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.240]
The microphone, the duck button,

[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.600]
just can't seem to be left alone.

[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:55.860]
And all of this is because they like saying.

[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:56.600]
They got f***ing.

[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.160]
They got f***ing.

[01:09:58.660 --> 01:09:58.960]

Oh, but they play football badly.

[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.100]
I think so, yeah.

[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:14.420]
How did the patriots kick their ass?

[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:15.620]
Look for f***ing.

[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:20.820]
Well, they make it to the Super Bowl.

[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.320]
But with an attitude as bad as theirs.

[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:26.780]
They were.

[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:30.200]
They're tossing our hopes down the stairs.

[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:31.480]
Oh, f***ing.

[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:34.940]
Mood of Noxious foul and distasteful.

[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:38.760]
The dolphins are cursing and man it's distraightful.

[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:42.420]
Because Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying.

[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.320]

Suck my f***ing.

[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:48.940]

[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:49.720]
Mother f***ing.

[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.640]
They are saying.

[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:51.900]
Suck my f***ing.

[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:52.780]

[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.460]
Oh, bди.

Make my f***ing.

[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:57.660]
You have f***ing.

[01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:58.500]
Mother f***ing.

[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.660]
I just didn't look a great marketing idea.

[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:03.720]
the avoid today's the day ought to be in there with that the patent office you know

[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:07.480]
you know how they have like to see role pops how about if they had like a

[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:09.740]
sucker called dick pops

[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:13.080]
and you could say look my

[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:15.720]
now would be a comment in there

[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:19.720]
uh...

[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.100]
where would the comment go in that sentence

[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:22.200]
ten to twenty

[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.760]
okay see i'm sick i'm really sick i'm happy to be

[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.620]
anyway speaking of sick i am uh... take everything back i said about city

[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.160]
link i'm embarrassed just like what you can't

[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.900]
what was that was embarrassed about that they had an air something really wrote

[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.200]
test on the same page

[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:36.820]
mortified

[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.440]
more to call well guess what best newspaper call in the sports gets to

[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.500]
they picked their thos on the city link

[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.180]
michael mayo

[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.000]
the anxious michael mascovitz may or whatever his name is

[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.360]
from the scum sent them

[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.380]
so mike may or was premature to write that you need someone they chicken hard

[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:58.480]
to cover when a story wrongfully broke that the dolphin coach was

[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.720]
resigning it turns out that johnson was the current after all

[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.900]
and the same can be said for me or was never been afraid to tell it like it is

[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.600]
or how it should be with the support of sports team

[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.200]
but but but it's concise yet

[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.940]
entertain almost always fair it says

[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:12.840]
i guess the almost might have to do with our close

[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.500]
best personal friend

[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:18.080]

the hopper said yes

[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:34.900]
excellent book i read a lot of it last night because it was really whatever was

[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:38.760]
on tv the uh... whatever game i was fully in the buffalo pretty boring

[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.560]
and uh... i was reading a lot of the boy outside of brought back a lot of

[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:46.080]
good memories for me and bad memories of here's marv Albert by the way very

[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:46.940]
young marv Albert

[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.660]
when he assigned out to the rangers games a hundred years ago

[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:52.440]
looking just like our own kory savin a little bit more here

[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.260]
i would say this picture looks more like kory savin well almost as much

[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:58.620]
is the dead and we can and looks like santa shan

[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.060]
that's going to be our office poll the audience can participate in the

[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:04.080]
poll because they can't see him

[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.520]
but kory savin and uh... young marv Albert i don't know of kory's in like you

[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.740]
know putting on negligee and panties and a lot of backbiting but

[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:11.840]
we are Jewish

[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.020]
oh that that's right

[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:14.220]
all i think i'll be

[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.780]
well and here's one of the here's all these pictures great book howby

[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.940]
it says there are many who believe that win all you might have been the best

[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:26.200]
radio broadcast to the new york rangers ever had to

[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.440]
which i would say absolutely correct her he was great

[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:34.420]
win all you know what i think i have a good ball on cbs radio sports for

[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:34.820]
years

[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:39.780]
but boy did he do a great thing he made those games exciting and uh... he was

[01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:42.900]
great no they remember that no win all you do in the range and there's a

[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.200]
whole big piece here in jim gordon

[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.780]
we did the jen and i'm great thing unless kiter

[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:50.020]
like i said has been in a while for about a hundred years live in life of

[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:50.300]
riley

[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:56.100]
more and and uh... how they have a stamp out is obsessed and i'm not

[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.700]
knocking because this is a good guy marty glickman

[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.560]
with that real real heavy new york more the glickman i mean

[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:05.980]
see marty was great but he couldn't get a job anywhere other than new york

[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:08.320]
and when we'll be because he had a real heavy northeastern accent

[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.180]
but he was great

[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.740]
he did the joint schemes for about six hundred years

[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:15.020]
and also what called the racist at yankers raceway before bullet bob

[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:17.260]
myr anybody know anything about that of course not

[01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:20.980]
cian talking that abstract all these people they know what i'm talking about

[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.200]
they would know bullet bob myr from uh... jordan myr

[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.640]
exactly same difference to you right

[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:30.020]
from myr cahani

[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.040]
he's not doing too good

[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:37.420]
so like i said if you're into new york radio or radio sports there is d row

[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.860]
out there got us he was good

[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.180]
he was outstanding there's al helford

[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:42.800]
uh... we already did this yesterday

[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.480]
and there's more to glickman look at that morning must have been about two feet

[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:45.900]
tall

[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:50.300]
and giants putter dav jenny he did that or dav jenny's was like nine feet tall

[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.360]
because more marty glickman looks like a midget

[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:56.260]
or any hardwell the great or any hardwell gets in t-thirty he's great though

[01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:57.440]
done dumpy

[01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:00.840]
i would say the greatest boxing announcer whoever lived on the field on with less

[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:01.200]
citer

[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:04.460]
and bill stern but uh... done up it was the best

[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:08.340]
court goudi looking about two hundred years old i picture vince gully

[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.320]
melale melale melvin israel

[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:13.880]

[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:33.540]
all these people

[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:37.280]
who have come here from all these other but i'm talking about ten world

[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.460]
countries i'm talking about other places in america i pose this question yesterday

[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:44.660]
i've been posing it for twenty three years for all you poseers out there

[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:48.360]
what did they do where did they go to the ever-know-one thing about

[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.700]
all of these things i'm always referring to no

[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.440]
i don't get it

[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:56.120]
i just don't understand it

[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:57.220]
but what do i know

[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:58.800]
that you can't

[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.620]
a george yes sir

[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:02.580]
i had an error on the annual

[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:03.560]
we want to be to george

[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:07.300]
uh... no no i'd rather speak to you i'd tell you that i i work with marty

[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:08.140]
glitman would go last

[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:11.500]
like i said if you look long enough you find a guy that knows something about

[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:11.900]
life

[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:15.160]
now i work at the connective radio network when i was in college and after that

[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.360]
he used to call university football you're gonna get football back to

[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:18.900]
right

[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.760]
i gotta say i he was i he was terrible but this is like the early eighties

[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.420]
and he just uh...

[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:29.020]
he got the names wrong in everything he was he wasn't a bad guy to work with

[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:32.420]
he was a nice enough guy to deal with but yeah it just wasn't uh...

[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:34.220]
wasn't a good uh... work

[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:37.580]
you're gonna have to hop over dav halberstand spot it because he's obsessed with

[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:40.980]
marty glitman i'm not just he just he's on almost every page every time he

[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:44.020]
mentions marty's name i'd like to i'd definitely want to see that book i mean

[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:46.860]
i know marty glitman was tremendous in the fifties and the sixties even into

[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:50.160]
the seventies but you know you said you said yourself a hundred times it's

[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.320]
sometimes just got stuck away

[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.060]
now dav jennings i've met dav jennings a few times he is like six foot four

[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:55.380]
so

[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.280]
so that's why you're saying marty glitman you know might be on the

[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:01.740]
about three feet six in that picture you know jennings was the punter for the

[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:06.140]
giants and uh... i don't know i met him a few times because his father was

[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:09.460]
the president of the university that i went to when he was around the campus

[01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.340]
quite a bit in the springtime stuff and i met him

[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:14.500]
i can't just do different things but he's like six four so yeah

[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:19.500]
and i i definitely i think i think i'll be like the marty glitman because he was

[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.120]
jewish

[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.140]

[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:26.120]
mel Allen he liked him red barber not too crazy about he was a boy

[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.840]
the jewish guys he liked the best

[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:31.960]

[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:12.380]
over

[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:13.300]
the book of the ranger

[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:15.280]
the white was not a book of the

[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:19.260]

[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:16.500]
right on target jim gordon see that's one way jim gordon was great i don't know how he was

[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:19.880]
on the giants games i never heard me got a lot of criticism in the year he was great on a ranger

[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.980]

[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:29.920]
both television and radio puts the accolades for foster he would in a tempered perspective it

[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.740]
didn't take much to be good back then we were a primitive business by today standards he was awful

[01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:40.100]

[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.680]
brought up the david halberstown book because these people don't know what i'm talking about

[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:41.160]
how sad how sad indeed that we're here in this god for second place

[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:46.060]
where they don't know they don't know uh they they don't know when Elliot from the trooper

[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:50.120]
carburetor for five fifty w depend so the bad that's the promise two days ago he was going to

[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:55.540]
bring tape and yesterday's apologize this 40 cents in today remember the tape of the apantha game

[01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:59.820]
from the other night which i didn't have thank god where uh and i've and there's no point in my

[01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:05.040]
watching it because i found out from the inside that he already said um shiny hockey then he's

[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:10.340]
this time he didn't say what he usually says like i feel really really you know he said they were

[01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:17.040]
playing shiny hockey and then it goes on here to just rip the you'd like this note by the way

[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:24.900]
just rip the crap uh on uh rumor just rip stay at this note i mean just rip it and it says please do

[01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:32.260]
four to five hours today about uh david keon okay we love david keon we love you david but you're

[01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:36.520]
the best etc even though he didn't show up on at last night in the gardens but you needed the rest

[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:41.820]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line see the one of the reasons

[01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:45.020]
that this could never be a sports down even if it had the inclination to which it does not

[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:49.440]
and that they when you hear these people calling in they don't even know who to help build zimperies

[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:53.720]
okay or like i ask you know do you like zimper better than rick weaver they don't even remember

[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:58.260]
who rick weaver was seriously i've never had a call about rick weaver

[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:05.920]
and how can you be a sports fan without getting into the broadcasters who made the game exciting

[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.480]
and of course down here most of the sports guys never did make the game exciting in the first

[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:14.320]
place so that's why so what are they ever here in their lives what do they know Christina moron

[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:23.760]
bill zimper that's decadal computerized voices that sounds like it's being spit out of a computer

[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:28.160]
well totally lacking in the void of any personality like hank always says and he's right about this

[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:32.680]
if you went out on the street even if you went to the stadium where all the sports nerds are

[01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:36.800]
and you walked up to a hundred people and said who's the broadcaster for the adult in games can you

[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:41.440]
tell me and they probably if they had any name they would say all right your manage even though he

[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:45.220]
does the color not to play by play and you say okay well he does the color and he's great he's

[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:50.100]
funny but who does the play by play and you know what they would say yeah that's what they'd say

[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:55.620]
they don't know wqa m

[01:31:55.620 --> 01:32:01.780]
hey yeah this is George yes sir would you give Neil today man he fired up like great yeah he's

[01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:06.180]
out of his mind today of course I think he's done drugs I mean he's great he brought some good stuff

[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:13.040]
back from honest to them then I haven't seen him so rap it's like I don't know I know it's like he's

[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:17.680]
like a mocked ten well maybe because that's fat tub lost a little weight you know oh that might do

[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:22.720]
have a great day pal wait him a what then let's go he want to talk to him no I was going to tell

[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:28.280]
you it first and tell you tell me what you thought of it okay well you know how he's always talking

[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:34.640]
about that guy Peter North yeah that step star well I'll give me a guy gave me a movie with Peter

[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:40.140]
no one said it yeah and I never seen a guy gave you movie with Peter in it yeah really then I never

[01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:45.620]
seen such muzzle velocity in my life uh-huh anyways then they were good yeah yeah then there was

[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:52.340]
another one the court court court court court court yeah with a Vanessa del Rio right and she

[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:58.280]
was two what she was doing two guys at the same time I don't mean two guys different hold I mean

[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:06.880]
two guys in the same orifice yeah so then it reminds me that old adage sure it must be wrong

[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:12.080]
one in the hand is not right we're two in the bush yeah okay anyway five six seven oh five

[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:15.940]

[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:42.180]
owned it he's the one to put it on the ear and you're a jackmark don't even know that

great even his last guy he was sensational whatever the hell he was talking about but most of them it's

[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:49.840]
like yeah when the draft started already fed so huh that's why the draft is so big down here and

[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:55.320]
you know something most of these people couldn't catch pneumonia in a draft these losers these low

[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:59.240]
lives no lives we got those cheer lives that were going to be selling here for ten bucks a pop

[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:03.100]
you pour a little water even you take a little squirt squirt on it and the life start

[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:11.360]
scroll right there funny rise wqa m sam rose and baby he's in there he's in there he's got how do

[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:18.240]
you know he never gets to say anything shady he never gets to say three words shady bap bap bap bap bap bap

[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:22.620]
they're scoring goals and sam is desperate open up as a bap bap bap nice nose two sand by the way

[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:26.960]
we're seeing by within those like that i remember he uh he definitely got a face for radio

[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:31.660]
sam i remember the late 70s early 80s when cable first came down here it's it's important and the

[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:36.640]
big whistle was going again oh really yeah i never saw that i never saw Jim Gordon on tv

[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:41.100]
buried back in the the ranger suckback and that it makes a bad trade what do you mean back then

[01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:47.300]
back then you don't have to turn the clock back for that they suck down the best the best

[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:51.360]
announcer the rangers had on hockey was more of albert that was his best sport no the best

[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:56.120]
announcer before your time was winelius yeah but marvus pretty good was i never heard him do hockey

[01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:00.220]
was he good at what actually i'm like the asshole down here he actually told you what was going on

[01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:03.740]
well that's the idea see that's why anybody would say Chris morons and announcer doesn't know

[01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:07.200]
what the sports all about the best the best news of the cancers this year is that is that

[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:11.660]
asshole is that of here that's right that's the that's the silver lining in a dark ugly season is

[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:15.480]
that we say goodbye to Christina moron you're absolutely great he's the worst they ever heard

[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:20.040]
i mean how they hired that guy i'll never know i think he had naked pictures of somebody

[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:25.520]
organization of the spokesman yeah the spokesman maybe yeah okay pal say how to winelius

[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:32.300]
winelius winelius tv sports he was great i know before most of your time a bunch of little punks

[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:36.000]
that and that's sad because most of you grew up during this jockeocracy crept with a bunch of

[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.920]
illiterate x-jocks like Fran healy and the highly touted timmacarva who by the way halberstam

[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.320]
says wonderful things a timmacarva another one bap bap bap bap bap bap

[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:49.380]
doesn't add a god damn thing to the game he second guesses every pitch every play never

[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:54.840]
shuts up for a second and he had nothing to the game timmacarva he should only croco wicked death

[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:59.780]
that's how much i despise timmacarva and even though i like dav halberstam they believe me

[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:04.220]
the way out of line on this one and according to some of the new yorkers at least at one

[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:07.140]
marty glickman suck too i don't know i just remember the voice

[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:11.720]
wardy glickman with a real real heavy new york accent and i wondered how could a guy like this

[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:15.120]
with an accent like that possibly beyond here i know i thought well he's in new york

[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:20.720]

[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:16.800]
21 seconds left, he saw to the right a tight nut that was scored.

[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.800]
First period, Mueller now against Oats.

[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:23.460]
Back to roll off.

[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:24.140]
Shot!

[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:27.520]
Goal for Wistchock!

[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:28.940]
Goal in home!

[01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:31.660]
Connecting head up and boss with 18 seconds left.

[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:36.780]
22-560 WQM, 56-705-60, pound-560 on the mobile one line.

[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:40.740]
We're doing screenless so they all crap out during the break because the lines disconnect after 400 rings.

[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:41.340]
And that's good.

[01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:43.020]
They don't have to wait during all those commercials.

[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:46.040]
Yeah, we're talking about some good stuff.

[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.800]
Okay, which you don't find too much of it down here.

[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:53.880]
And like I said, if you've got people who pretend to be sports fans and they know nothing about sports casting, then they really aren't sports fans.

[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:55.680]
What do they ever hear? What do they know?

[01:43:56.020 --> 01:44:00.320]
What is their life consistent beside the Chiya life that they have to water 10 times a day?

[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:04.160]
That the neighbor has to come over and pee on it to see if they can get anything to sprout.

[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:07.200]
WQM.

[01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:10.680]
That city link article is all wrong.

[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:13.480]
Jeff Rimmer is the best announcer in South Florida.

[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:15.600]
And those seats won all that bad.

[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:16.660]
Yeah, okay, thanks, Chef.

[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:18.580]
WQM, hello.

[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:19.640]
Hello.

[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:20.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:24.680]
Good, why, why, and, good, why, and...

[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:26.440]
Let me tell you something about those seats at the...

[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:28.460]
Good, why, why, and...

[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:28.900]
They're stunk.

[01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:31.120]
WQM, hello.

[01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:33.780]
Did your lovely receptionist give you the Denise took?

[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:34.520]
Yeah.

[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:36.740]
And he says, he says, shini hockey on there.

[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:38.320]
Shini?

[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:39.800]
Yeah, with two ends.

[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:40.820]
Are you sure?

[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:42.240]
That's Pond hockey.

[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:43.100]
That's what they call it.

[01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:44.720]
The old time is they call Pond hockey.

[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:46.020]
They used to call shini hockey.

[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:46.660]
So nice try.

[01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:47.620]
But thanks for the tape, though.

[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:48.020]
All right.

[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:49.100]
It'll come in handy.

[01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:49.400]
Thank you.

[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:53.280]
Yeah, it's not even a six hour, it's a six and a half hour tape.

[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:58.260]
It's a T-130, which is exactly what an AMR security thing on the VCR.

[01:44:58.900 --> 01:44:59.400]
Thank you, sir.

[01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:00.020]
God bless you.

[01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:01.700]
Am I going to watch that thing?

[01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:01.980]
No.

[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:02.700]
No.

[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:06.720]
I'd like to, like, I'm at the game Saturday night in Toronto, okay?

[01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:08.920]
And Rimmer says, oh, did you tape the game?

[01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:10.400]
And keep in mind, I'm up there.

[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:13.300]
I'm going to set my VCR to tape a game that I'm going to see live.

[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:14.120]
Of course not.

[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:17.080]
And like I said to him, I said, and if I did tape the game,

[01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:19.440]
you think I'm going to tape it off the sports channel Florida,

[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:22.740]
when I could take it off of the CBC with Bob Cullen-Harry Neal.

[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:24.420]
And I'm going to tape your telecast, Rimmer.

[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:25.760]
Are you serious?

[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:26.320]
No.

[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:28.920]
WQAM.

[01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:29.180]
Hello.

[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:30.280]
Yeah, hello.

[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:30.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:31.880]
Yeah, I'm in Bokeh.

[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:33.340]
Let's go to Bokeh.

[01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:33.580]
Hello.

[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:35.340]
Hey, Neil.

[01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:35.920]
Yes, sir.

[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:37.040]
No, I'm the draft.

[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:38.080]
Yeah.

[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:42.200]
Yeah, on Rimmer, because I would like to see him screw up and bumble around a bunch of times.

[01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:46.500]
And the best, the mentor of the Hadeb Pascupal is Eric Reed.

[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:47.540]
Thank you.

[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:48.140]
Okay.

[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:52.440]
I've seen Eric Reed 77 times, and he's never stopped talking through his teeth.

[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:54.400]
He never stops talking through his teeth.

[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:56.780]
He even wishful, he talks through his teeth so much.

[01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:00.400]
Now, he stopped doing that for a short period of time.

[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:02.880]
I remember a couple of years ago commenting on the year how much he had proved

[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:05.160]
because he stopped doing that for only talking through his teeth.

[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:08.840]
There's 76 to 72, and he's back doing it again now.

[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:11.820]
He blows WQAM.

[01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:14.460]
QAM.

[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:16.100]
Going once.

[01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:17.700]
WQAM.

[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:17.920]
Hello.

[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:20.420]
Yeah, a couple of hockey questions for you.

[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:21.400]
What do you mean hockey?

[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:22.480]
Is this a hockey show?

[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:23.260]
Yes.

[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:24.760]
Better than some of the other topics, right?

[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:25.240]
Like what?

[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.200]
I've never heard you talk about Pat Foley as a hockey announcer up in Chicago.

[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:29.640]
He's good.

[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:30.920]
Pat Foley is good, very good.

[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.200]
I hear the other person.

[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:34.780]
I hear the Black Hawk, so I have a jaded view, but he's very good.

[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:35.440]
And you know what?

[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:38.820]
The Black Hawk's in Panthers way I see it, Neil, very similar.

[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:43.680]
If you look at the attendance at the night at the dinner, the Black Hawk's are really terrible.

[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:44.580]
And you know what?

[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:46.540]
Next year's going to be the same thing at our new arena.

[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:47.060]
Right.

[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:50.020]
Is it going to be tough for one brother to fire another?

[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:52.440]
No, but let me ask you this.

[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:57.260]
How tough is it for the president of the organization, Viltory, to fire both brothers, make a package deal?

[01:46:57.260 --> 01:46:58.180]
Oh, it's a small.

[01:46:58.620 --> 01:46:58.800]
Right.

[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:01.000]
Two pink clips for the president.

[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.440]
One, even Marv Albert would go for that.

[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.300]
5.6705.50.

[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:06.700]
It's my last game.

[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:09.480]
I realize we have one more Saturday, which I gave the tickets away to one year today.

[01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:11.560]
Last Panther game in the year for some of us.

[01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:14.560]
The Panthers and those frogs, the Montreal kind of deans tonight.

[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:18.060]
Did we find out if Beth Cohen is singing the national anthem, by the way?

[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:19.800]
Does anybody know the answer to that?

[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:21.380]
Huh?

[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:22.200]
Don't we?

[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:22.480]
No.

[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:25.240]
Yeah, if she's got, because if she's not singing, I may have to stay home.

[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:27.820]
Unless that young sparzer guy, he's good too.

[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:30.200]
A Sean, Ibron, Ibron, Ibron, Ibron, Ibron.

[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:31.100]
I think it's Sean Ibron.

[01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:33.620]
He's a Jewish sparzer.

[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:34.880]
He's going to be singing tonight, maybe.

[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:38.120]
And even if Aaron Bergallif, they brought him back.

[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:40.220]
He must have had a falling out with Wayne or something.

[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.340]
Now, he's not the one that's married to Wayne's son, is he?

[01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:45.780]
WQA and hello.

[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:48.460]
You do know that, don't you?

[01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:51.660]
WQA and hello.

[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:53.300]
The actor is Neil.

[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:53.800]
Speaking.

[01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:55.140]
Neil?

[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:55.640]
Yes, sir.

[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:56.580]
You do know that, don't you?

[01:47:57.820 --> 01:47:58.620]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:02.220]
Isn't that pathetic?

[01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:03.360]
Isn't that pathetic?

[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.120]
They get on and then it's like, eh.

[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:06.660]

[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:06.900]
Eh.

[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:07.980]
Yeah.

[01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:09.940]
And back to you.

[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.100]
Back in you.

[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:12.620]
WQA and.

[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:15.600]
Hello.

[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:17.580]
WQA and hello.

[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:21.520]
See, now we have a bunch of copycat more.

[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:22.180]
No, we don't.

[01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:24.080]
So, what it was to believe there?

[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:24.680]
What's the problem?

[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:25.800]
I had my radio on.

[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:27.680]
I wanted to turn that stupid radio off.

[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:28.560]
But then you listen to the radio.

[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:30.900]
Will you listen to Paul Castanovah doing repeats of this show?

[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:32.680]
He does do that.

[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:33.260]
Yes, he does.

[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.460]
He does repeats of every show.

[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:35.700]
Hey.

[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:37.220]
Are you sure positive?

[01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:43.120]
But, but, but, but, a while back, some guy called and said you could get Bob and Tom or Lauderdale.

[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:46.240]
And I've been listening to him on the way to work and they are great.

[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:47.440]
What did I tell you?

[01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:48.300]
Oh, man, they are a lot of fun.

[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:50.460]
That's Morning Show in America, Bob and John.

[01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:51.100]
Absolutely.

[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:51.900]
They are hysterical.

[01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:52.440]
They are original.

[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:55.740]
They don't just bring on, you know, lesbians every morning waiting for you to grab yourself,

[01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:56.380]
your stick ship.

[01:48:56.740 --> 01:48:57.740]
They are really funny.

[01:48:57.900 --> 01:48:58.220]
Absolutely.

[01:48:58.780 --> 01:48:59.280]
And they are great.

[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:00.400]
And you're got.

[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:01.340]
And God bless you.

[01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:01.820]
Have a good day.

[01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:03.640]
Now, how come they didn't get a mention here by the way?

[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:05.500]
I didn't scour through the city link thing.

[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:07.360]
How come Bob and Tom don't get no mention, huh?

[01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:10.360]
Because they too busy sucking Howard's ass in the city link.

[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.900]
Because it's a brow thing and they figure all the New Yorkers.

[01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:14.100]
We don't have the New Yorkers.

[01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:16.380]
You notice that?

[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:18.600]
Two things in this audience.

[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:20.560]
We don't have any Jews and we have the New Yorkers.

[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:21.740]
And maybe there's some crossover there.

[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:22.180]
You think so?

[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:23.240]
Might be a little crossover.

[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:24.820]
We don't have any of either one.

[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:28.680]
I asked questions about the Jewish things like paysocks.

[01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:29.220]
Remember the other day?

[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:29.600]
Nothing.

[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:35.460]
Well, by the way, Georgia's crazy Jewish accountant called this morning and did wonderful things

[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:35.860]
for him.

[01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:37.380]
And he's still crazier to bedbugs.

[01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:39.320]
And a stone age goofball.

[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:43.060]
And I'm embarrassed and humiliated that he's walking around taking up good space.

[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:49.420]
Now that he's done his thing for you this year and straighten that probably had gotten

[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:50.840]
you money coming back from the government.

[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:52.680]
Can't we just say goodbye to him now?

[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.100]
Can't we send him a broad?

[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:56.340]
Send him two or three broads.

[01:49:56.740 --> 01:49:56.740]

[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:00.160]
Probably an old pervert if you ask me.

[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:01.000]
A young pervert.

[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:03.080]
Orthodox my ass.

[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.020]
Oh, no, not for you.

[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:05.080]
Not for you, David.

[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:06.880]
Maniac.

[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:08.140]
Hey, you never know.

[01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:11.380]
Crazy Jews with a beard and a yard that's shmata on.

[01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:15.500]
The only thing I know is he's been laying too much to fill in.

[01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:19.540]
Like my doctor, David, with that turn of kid.

[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:21.760]
Oh, I don't want to go back into that again because Dr. Mark will get upset.

[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:22.380]
He's a good guy.

[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:24.360]
He just had a stressful day.

[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:25.260]
Yes, Bush.

[01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:26.920]
Back to my house.

[01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:28.140]
Look who's back.

[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:29.280]
Yeah.

[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:31.800]
Look what's up, doc.

[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:36.400]
Bugs' money and the whole gang is back.

[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:40.200]
In a fool-length motion picture that the adults are assured to love.

[01:50:41.620 --> 01:50:43.500]
Evil, evil, equia.

[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:46.340]
I'm about to do me a rabbit.

[01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:52.020]
Siskle and Ebert say leave the kids home for this one.

[01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:56.480]
Bugs' money.

[01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:58.340]
Stars in Bugs' bodies.

[01:50:58.680 --> 01:50:59.840]
Waking at moments.

[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:00.440]
Me.

[01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:02.940]
Me and I, Stinka.

[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:04.240]
I mean, soon enough either.

[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:04.880]
You're useless.

[01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:06.420]
Oh, Richie Hepner.

[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:07.560]
Well, he gave one.

[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:08.960]
You suppose he can trap one.

[01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:10.060]
I thought a dengerling.

[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:10.980]
Can you give it?

[01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:11.980]
And he'd take it away.

[01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:14.460]
He just went out of here now.

[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:17.760]
This would be some kind of pandemonium.

[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:19.460]
And why not?

[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:23.080]
Here's the one two-page commercial.

[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:25.400]
And there's a ball hit deep to that field.

[01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:27.080]
Back to his body balance.

[01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:29.040]
And he can't get it.

[01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:30.100]
Just a good ball.

[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:36.440]
Well, what you're hearing me say.

[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:37.600]
He can give us anything.

[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:43.580]
And he just gave us today on a whole round.

[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:44.700]
His first ministry.

[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:47.200]
Bobby bought some leaf pie.

[01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:49.960]
And it's just over the glove.

[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:52.840]
And the pirate's feed.

[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:54.340]
Bit of ice.

[01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:55.080]
From the label.

[01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:56.900]
Okay, Bob Prince, the greatest of them all.

[01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:57.560]
I can goose bumps.

[01:51:57.660 --> 01:51:59.160]
So I get here on my sphincture.

[01:51:59.180 --> 01:51:59.940]
It starts growing.

[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:02.920]
1245 at 560 WQM.

[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:04.040]
Do these people know Bob Prince?

[01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:04.260]
No.

[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:05.300]
Do they know what Prince?

[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:05.660]
No.

[01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:06.520]
Formerly known as?

[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:06.760]
No.

[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:09.060]
Yeah, that was the answer formally known as Bob Prince.

[01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:15.660]
WQM.

[01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:17.200]
Hey, you have got.

[01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:17.880]
How are you, sir?

[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:18.900]
Figular.

[01:52:19.140 --> 01:52:19.560]
Massive.

[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:22.080]
It's a freaking big convention.

[01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:24.500]
I-75 going south.

[01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:27.180]
From like a commercial down through Oakland.

[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:30.020]
I swear there's like over a dozen Halloween.

[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:30.640]
Yeah.

[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:31.520]
Multi-agency.

[01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:32.800]
It's a php.

[01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:34.780]
Well, I used to have high regard for.

[01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:35.760]
But why is that?

[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:37.480]
Why did you have- they do nothing but write tickets?

[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:38.380]
They don't do anything.

[01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:40.240]
Yeah, but they seem to be professionals.

[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.160]
No, they're both professionals.

[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:42.440]
Professional ticket writers, that's right.

[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:43.560]
They don't do a goddamn thing.

[01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:44.160]
The php.

[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:44.680]
Oh, right.

[01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:47.100]
The bad ones are the php.

[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:49.020]
Yeah, well, I got nothing but write tickets.

[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:51.560]
That's the only goddamn thing they do is write tickets.

[01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:54.440]
And do they write tickets for things that aren't even illegal?

[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:55.000]
Like.

[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:56.840]
Well, in rental vehicles.

[01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:58.260]
No, if you're in a car, right?

[01:52:58.600 --> 01:52:58.780]
Yeah.

[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:00.840]
I got pulled over in a rental van.

[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:02.260]
It was at least with the company.

[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:02.680]
In a fancy van?

[01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:03.600]
Huh?

[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:04.060]
Yeah.

[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:08.720]
And the decal on the tag didn't match the tag.

[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:12.500]
For a statute, if your company that has over a thousand vehicles,

[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:14.720]
the decals don't need to match the tag.

[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:15.160]
Yeah.

[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:20.460]
So he writes me a citation for expired tag, because it's not the right decal.

[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:22.220]
My citation is from Crown 1948.

[01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:24.860]
For Lonious decal.

[01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:25.220]
Yeah.

[01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:26.600]
A felonious decal?

[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:28.840]
Yeah, it was the wrong decal.

[01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:30.080]
Can you relate to felonious clonk?

[01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:31.560]
So I was committing fraud.

[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:32.460]
Well, don't do it again.

[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:32.800]
Okay.

[01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:34.060]
This guy's all been out of shape.

[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:36.000]
And he thought they were good guys.

[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:38.080]
Does anybody else think the FHP are good guys?

[01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:38.240]
No.

[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:39.280]
Not anybody with a brain.

[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:40.880]
I guess you'll learn your lesson in a hard way, pal.

[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:45.120]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:45.920]
A screenless Wednesday?

[01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:48.120]
Just the way I like it?

[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:49.540]
No, it's good.

[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:50.640]
It keeps them on their toes.

[01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:52.060]
Like that little pole we had this morning.

[01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:54.020]
About those great hockey shows.

[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:55.340]
Should we ever have another hockey show?

[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:56.340]
And they said, they stuck.

[01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:57.240]
Don't do it again.

[01:53:57.580 --> 01:53:58.780]
Not if you want to stay on here, Mr.

[01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:01.880]
Here's something QAM.

[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:02.160]
Hello.

[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:06.260]
Speaking of the pigs, they're going to be voting up in the ass of Hasse about pulling you

[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:08.920]
over now just for no reason if you're not wearing a seatbelt.

[01:54:08.980 --> 01:54:09.900]
Yeah, isn't that nice?

[01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:10.580]
Isn't that nice?

[01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:12.440]
And you know that they're going to say yes.

[01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:14.220]
They're going to look very high.

[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:15.100]
All the goody-two shoes.

[01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:16.100]
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

[01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:17.100]
You've got to wear your seatbelt.

[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:18.180]
No crime in Florida.

[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:20.000]
But if you don't have your seatbelt on, you're going to...

[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.420]
Well, I'm going to get one of those that you want those phony ones.

[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.080]
That's like a cardboard thing you put on your chest.

[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:26.540]
I'm going to get a note from my doctor.

[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:28.080]
It says I got a separated shoulder.

[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:28.540]
How's that?

[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:30.500]
I'm going to get a note from my doctor too.

[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:31.800]
Okay, so at least he can do for me after he's...

[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:32.580]
It's part of the event.

[01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:33.700]
We should all that time the other day.

[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:38.580]
Of course, the Panther Games tonight make sure they show that same clip that from meatballs.

[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:40.520]
It just doesn't matter.

[01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:41.040]
Okay.

[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:42.280]
It does matter.

[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:42.940]
It matters a lot.

[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:46.040]
That's why we're firing the coach in his brother, the BM of the GM.

[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:50.720]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:52.180]
WQAM.

[01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:55.240]
I'll listen to you on my voice.

[01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:58.420]
That was good.

[01:54:58.760 --> 01:54:59.980]
That was a helium modicone.

[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:00.880]
That was beautiful.

[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:02.780]
Thank you.

[01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:04.300]
WQAM.

[01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:06.300]
Hello.

[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:06.840]
Yes.

[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:07.400]
Hi.

[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:07.880]
Hi.

[01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:09.160]
I'm here.

[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:09.940]
I'm here too.

[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:10.940]
Oh, Neil.

[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:11.540]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:12.480]
Hi, I'm sorry.

[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:12.980]
That's okay.

[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:14.460]
I knew Bob Prince.

[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:16.140]
I'm from Pittsburgh.

[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:16.880]
All right.

[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:19.960]
And that gave me chills when you just played.

[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:20.480]
Was it great?

[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:22.160]
His daughter was a friend of mine.

[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:24.680]
I see the problem with the Bob Prince cuts.

[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:27.700]
I can't get any of this stuff because his wife, I don't know if you know this or not.

[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:28.060]
No.

[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:30.300]
But she had the rights to all of his tapes and everything.

[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:30.760]
Yeah.

[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:35.420]
And so, you know, I've had people contact KDKA and I've had people contact the pirate organization.

[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:38.480]
And my good friend Mike Lang from Pittsburgh tried to get me some stuff.

[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:42.580]
You can't get it because most of the stuff you get is recreated, which is all phoning.

[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:43.420]
It doesn't really sound good.

[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:47.720]
That clip that I just played, I think that's one of only two real cuts that I've ever got.

[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:49.560]
That were like from a real game from Bob Prince.

[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:51.400]
The other stuff they've got is recreated.

[01:55:51.580 --> 01:55:52.140]
It's all phoning.

[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:53.300]
Oh, that's really too bad.

[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:54.240]
Yeah, he was the best.

[01:55:54.400 --> 01:56:00.060]
There was nothing like sitting on a summer evening out in the porch listening to Prince call the game.

[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:00.900]
It was fabulous.

[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:03.540]
He was the greatest or nobody is even close.

[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:08.280]
And you know, either I don't know if it's KDK or the pirate fired him.

[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:08.840]
Yeah.

[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.380]
And they just about had riots.

[01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:13.100]
I was there.

[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:14.200]
I was there.

[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:14.980]
It was a parade.

[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:15.740]
It's KDK.

[01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:15.800]
It was a parade.

[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.300]
We're picketing against Wzysting House.

[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:19.440]
In fact, that's all Halberstember's book about that.

[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:20.380]
I'm going to have to read that.

[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:24.200]
Why does he have Prince in there just because he was the best or was he ever in New York?

[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:25.160]
He was in New York.

[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:29.220]
He talks about in fact the day that the Bobby Thompson at Tho Home Run and Russ Hodgers made

[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:31.180]
that famous call, you know, the Giants, when the pen-it-

[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:31.420]
Right.

[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:33.080]
Well Bob Prince was visiting the city.

[01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:34.660]
He was there to see the Play-Off game.

[01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:36.620]
He was in the booth with Hodges.

[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.720]
At the end of the game, after Hodges called the home run, he got so hysterical

[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:40.840]
that he ran out of there.

[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:43.700]
During the commercial break he said to Prince, you take it and do the wrap-up.

[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:46.580]
and even though he was sitting there in the york pop prints the wrap-up on that

[01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:48.200]
he's mentioned several times in the book

[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:50.180]
wonderful story he was a great guy

[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:52.320]
he was a lot of fun

[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:56.180]
and uh... great collection of suits he was either him or isn't else in the best

[01:56:56.180 --> 01:56:57.580]
collection of suits in the universe

[01:56:57.580 --> 01:57:01.300]
i know really funny but it was a good guy and it he was the best people

[01:57:01.300 --> 01:57:03.820]
like you said people down here just listen to vanilla

[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:07.660]

[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:10.860]
real excitement he would know us we i mean like he was part of the team he

[01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:13.360]
really believe that as opposed to this joe angel guy

[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:17.020]

[01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:17.700]

[01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:25.840]
fake excitement

[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:29.720]

[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:31.080]
spirit actor i think or something

[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:33.600]
and it's just embarrassing because he could be pretty good he's got a good

[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:33.900]
voice

[01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:35.120]
but he just makes me ill

[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:37.260]

[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:32.880]
is it no

[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:08.740]
based

[02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:09.040]
and

[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:11.180]
is

[02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:12.900]
can

[02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:29.060]
It's going to be a few minutes and then it's going to be a little bit more.

[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:30.660]
It's going to be a little bit more.

[02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:33.020]
It's going to be a little bit more.

[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:41.200]
One third here is five switching.

[02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:45.480]
I'm actually doing another disadvantage bar here just to get it out of the way to finish these off.

[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:46.600]
Okay, so they're not laying around.

[02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:48.460]
So no, I'm suspecting a slot comes in here.

[02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:49.280]
Like Josh Freeman.

[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:51.260]
Who would want him sticking one in his...

[02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:51.400]
Correct.

[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:51.900]
You know?

[02:11:53.140 --> 02:11:54.680]
These things are grotesque.

[02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:56.180]
Atkins disadvantage bar.

[02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:57.220]
Take it from me.

[02:11:57.360 --> 02:11:59.460]
Don't ever put this anywhere near your push.

[02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:02.680]
And God, don't stick it near your mouth, you might eat it.

[02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:07.020]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound, five, 60 on the 18T wireless line.

[02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:08.100]
You know, I should've known.

[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:10.420]
I can see I can't really know.

[02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:12.880]
To a degree I know it.

[02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:14.840]
But subconsciously I have to keep...

[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:15.800]
I have to block it out.

[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:21.900]
Because if I ever fully accept the notion, not the notion, the reality of what this place is all about,

[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:23.060]
then I couldn't continue.

[02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:23.860]
I could not do this.

[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:26.080]
So I have to keep conning myself.

[02:12:26.100 --> 02:12:31.040]
There's a little part of my brain that continues conning me into believing that maybe something is going to change.

[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:31.720]
Is it going to change?

[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:32.000]
No.

[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:33.040]
Through 23 years, no.

[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:40.680]
But the proof that in the pudding was, yesterday I read what I thought was a really neat column by Howard Kleinberg about the famous restaurant.

[02:12:41.980 --> 02:12:44.480]
Okay, now granted it closed a long time ago, 18 years ago.

[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:46.260]
But I'm thinking of myself coming to work this morning.

[02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:50.580]
If you were like 30 in 1981, today you're 48.

[02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:52.540]
We got plenty of people listening to our 48.

[02:12:53.340 --> 02:12:56.360]
If you were 25, you're 43, right?

[02:12:57.140 --> 02:12:58.760]
If you were 20, you're 38.

[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:00.960]
We don't have to be an old fart to remember the famous.

[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:03.120]
Then we have one call about the famous.

[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:06.820]
Did anybody give a crap about the greatest goddamn restaurant that was ever here?

[02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:06.960]
No.

[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:10.700]
And about the shelter water and the whole thing.

[02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:11.720]
What the hell was that?

[02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:13.960]
You didn't hear that beep?

[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:15.320]
What was that?

[02:13:16.340 --> 02:13:17.360]
I didn't hear it.

[02:13:19.980 --> 02:13:20.940]
We just had a beep.

[02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:22.600]
We just had a...

[02:13:22.600 --> 02:13:23.740]
No, not that.

[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:25.040]
Get out of here with this.

[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:26.160]
What's going on over here?

[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:27.100]
We just had a beep.

[02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:29.600]
That's what we had.

[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:34.720]
A spontaneous, we got pukes and pops and beeps and bleeps and...

[02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:38.080]
And you didn't even hear it.

[02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:44.140]
WQAM.

[02:13:45.340 --> 02:13:46.020]
Hello, Neil.

[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:46.520]
Yes, sir.

[02:13:46.820 --> 02:13:47.320]
How are you, sir?

[02:13:47.420 --> 02:13:47.640]
Okay.

[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:52.020]
That's Italian restaurant in Hollywood near 441.

[02:13:53.420 --> 02:13:54.620]
Daven Italian restaurant.

[02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:55.340]
What is it?

[02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:57.540]
Daven Italian restaurant.

[02:13:57.700 --> 02:13:58.060]
Daven.

[02:13:58.440 --> 02:13:58.860]
Yes, sir.

[02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:00.500]
That's crazy bread around.

[02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:01.940]
Yes, excellent.

[02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:05.560]
You got to go try this right on the corner of 441 and Hollywood Boulevard.

[02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:06.720]
Okay, thank you so much, sir.

[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:09.260]
Okay, I'm a little distracted here because that's how we did here, the beep.

[02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:09.800]
What is that?

[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:11.820]
It's the fat, was it on a paper?

[02:14:12.940 --> 02:14:13.480]
Or ink.

[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:14.360]
Oh, it's not an ink.

[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:16.860]
The fax machine is beeping back here, so we got to put some ink in it.

[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:20.140]
So that's luck that wrote the rumor, no rumor, no 50 million times.

[02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:21.880]
I'm wasting 85 pages of fax paper.

[02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:26.040]
You know, I mean, maybe my doctor's going to fax those blood test results over here sometime today.

[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:27.760]
Which you called me yesterday, which is very nice.

[02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:29.320]
But I'd like to see the whole thing, you know.

[02:14:30.380 --> 02:14:31.700]
Like Jack Webb used to say.

[02:14:33.420 --> 02:14:38.700]
Just the fax, please doc, maybe he'll fax that over when the fax machine is working again a couple minutes after you ink it up again.

[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:39.700]
What?

[02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:40.380]
Uh-uh, what?

[02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:42.600]
We don't have any ink.

[02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:46.900]
Well, what do you mean we don't have any ink?

[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:50.220]
You don't have any in there?

[02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:59.240]
What kind of a f***ing place is this anyway, you know?

[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:05.100]
I mean, you would think a paper clip, you know, anything, do we have it?

[02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:05.460]
No.

[02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:06.560]
Anybody know where it is?

[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:06.840]
No.

[02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:08.720]
Anybody got to hold anything in this joint?

[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:08.920]
No.

[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:14.160]
Just like yesterday morning, which I didn't even mention on the show yesterday, the satellite goes out.

[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:18.520]
And now the guy damn fax machine back here, are you sure that's what it is?

[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:19.740]
I unplugged it, yeah.

[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:21.920]
But I don't hear the beep coming from over there.

[02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:24.180]
I don't think that's what the property is.

[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:25.600]
It's coming from over to my right.

[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:33.660]
It's not coming from the fax machine.

[02:15:35.300 --> 02:15:36.580]
Did you, and you unplugged it?

[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:40.840]
I bet you the doctor marks going to fax me my stuff now and you unplugged the guy damn fax machine.

[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:43.380]
It's coming from the right.

[02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:50.400]
WQA and nut house, hello?

[02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:51.120]
Neil.

[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:51.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:52.700]
I got a couple things.

[02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:56.260]
First of all, I grew up in Philly, uh, Gene Hart.

[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:56.840]
I liked him.

[02:15:56.900 --> 02:15:58.780]
I didn't hear anybody else, but I liked Gene.

[02:15:58.780 --> 02:15:59.520]
He's in the book.

[02:15:59.980 --> 02:16:02.080]
Um, too many tasty cakes for Gene.

[02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:02.760]
Too many.

[02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:05.080]
Yeah, he put me to get up and down the stairs anymore.

[02:16:05.180 --> 02:16:07.300]
They just have to put him in a wheelbarrow and bring him up.

[02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:08.480]
He loved those tasty cakes.

[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:08.720]
Yeah.

[02:16:08.940 --> 02:16:10.240]
I got something for you in the, uh,

[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:11.620]
I mean, that was so bush league, man.

[02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:13.320]
Every time the Philly Flyers would screw or go,

[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:14.780]
another tasty tasty.

[02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:18.000]
I know the sponsor wanted that, but that was so bush league.

[02:16:18.260 --> 02:16:19.420]
Well, I know that, but that was bush league.

[02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:20.040]
I hated that.

[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:22.520]
So I got something for you in the New York post today.

[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:23.000]
Yeah.

[02:16:23.460 --> 02:16:24.760]
One, it's about Larry King.

[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:29.740]
The Chicago Tribune gossip column has claimed that before King goes on the air at CNN,

[02:16:30.420 --> 02:16:33.600]
he has a stylist painted scalp to make him for his thinning hair.

[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:34.840]
Really?

[02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:35.960]
Yeah, that's what it says here.

[02:16:36.060 --> 02:16:37.020]
I don't have a bonspot.

[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:38.280]
Page nine today.

[02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:39.660]
I don't have a bonspot.

[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:40.640]
See, he does.

[02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:42.560]
The other thing is that, uh,

[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:43.800]
Groot, he doesn't have a bonspot.

[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:44.260]
Yeah.

[02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:44.760]
He does.

[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:47.020]
Groot, and then we'll do it that way.

[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:50.620]
The prep school is having a wrestling homosexual problem right now.

[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:51.980]
It says that, uh,

[02:16:52.100 --> 02:16:52.720]
Isn't that redundant?

[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:54.440]
It might be, yes.

[02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:59.400]
It said that the pupils in the chapel April 1, they talked about reports.

[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:02.700]
You can see this is Paul K. the guy who's the, uh, chancellor.

[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:05.540]
Um, the, the, the, the,

[02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:09.780]
The line separating wrestling from horseplay and grobing has been crossed.

[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:14.740]
An old grotonian who passed along the letter claims that in his day,

[02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:17.980]
the wrestling room was always known as the passion pit for horny young men.

[02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:18.400]
Right.

[02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:20.000]
When they went co-ed in the 70s,

[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.760]
he was supposed to settle down those raging hormones.

[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:24.760]
I guess nothing changed what they said.

[02:17:25.780 --> 02:17:26.120]
Okay.

[02:17:26.220 --> 02:17:27.020]
Thanks for the good news.

[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:29.660]
Just after I thought we hit them all straight now with that.

[02:17:29.700 --> 02:17:32.660]
So I read the other day about the guy with the, um, this captain's penis on his arm.

[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:34.620]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:37.220]
pound 5, 60 on the 18 T wireless lines.

[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:38.320]
So I guess the beeping has stopped.

[02:17:38.380 --> 02:17:39.400]
I have no idea what that was.

[02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:40.460]
And what, it wasn't over there.

[02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:41.980]
Well, somewhere over there,

[02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:43.980]
which there's nothing over there that ought to be beeping,

[02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:45.340]
but it was over there.

[02:17:45.420 --> 02:17:46.660]
Remember that song over there?

[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:47.140]
Remember that?

[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:47.720]
Of course not.

[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:49.720]
WQA and hello.

[02:17:50.020 --> 02:17:50.700]
Hello, Neil.

[02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:51.120]
Yes.

[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:52.320]
I have a QAWA.

[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:52.660]
What is it?

[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:54.620]
WQA and hello.

[02:17:55.180 --> 02:17:55.400]
Neil.

[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:55.920]
Yes, sir.

[02:17:56.100 --> 02:17:56.840]
I don't know what's worse.

[02:17:57.180 --> 02:17:59.840]
Um, Rimmer show or Andy from Hollywood.

[02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:01.140]
Yeah.

[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:01.780]
Yeah.

[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:03.040]
I do.

[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:03.780]
What?

[02:18:04.100 --> 02:18:04.760]
Andy from Hollywood.

[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:06.880]
Not a contest.

[02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:09.240]
He's worse than a major disease.

[02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:12.940]
Like, he's worse than terminal illness of any kind that you can name.

[02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:13.760]
Which is deal?

[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:14.540]
I don't understand.

[02:18:14.660 --> 02:18:15.300]
What is his deal?

[02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:16.560]
He has no life.

[02:18:16.780 --> 02:18:17.640]
That is his deal.

[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:19.560]
He has no life.

[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:22.320]
If you cannot say goodbye to him, he's like Greg from Boyton V.

[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:23.540]
In fact, they're even buddies together.

[02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:26.720]
All these chronicstays have like a little grab ass fraternity with each other.

[02:18:27.060 --> 02:18:27.740]
They call each other.

[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:28.700]
They play with each other.

[02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:29.680]
He's a no life.

[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:31.820]
A low life, no life, a scumbag.

[02:18:31.980 --> 02:18:33.840]
Do they have to go to the games, not they?

[02:18:34.340 --> 02:18:34.480]
Huh?

[02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:35.400]
It doesn't have to be a lot.

[02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:36.060]
Not anymore.

[02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:38.660]
He didn't come to the last game or game before that.

[02:18:38.660 --> 02:18:39.580]
He was like, wandered by.

[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:40.480]
Oh, we're still friends.

[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:41.420]
I say, yeah, get out of here.

[02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:42.400]
How do you know what he looked like?

[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:42.720]
Huh?

[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:43.620]
How do you know what he looked like?

[02:18:43.620 --> 02:18:45.560]
Because he's made because he was coming by for a while.

[02:18:45.660 --> 02:18:46.400]
I didn't know who a while.

[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:51.360]
I didn't register that it was him the same asshole on the phone until he identified himself.

[02:18:51.500 --> 02:18:52.480]
I read he just played.

[02:18:52.940 --> 02:18:54.360]
He's like, Boyline annoying.

[02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:56.040]
No, no, he's not Borderline annoying.

[02:18:56.140 --> 02:18:57.280]
He's way over the Borderline.

[02:18:57.320 --> 02:18:59.180]
Even Madonna never saw Borderline like him.

[02:18:59.340 --> 02:19:00.400]
He's over the border, sir.

[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:01.140]
He's annoying.

[02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:02.020]
He's disgusting.

[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:03.580]
He makes me want to puke.

[02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:06.520]
I'd rather finish eating this at this advantage, Bar.

[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:06.900]
Look at that.

[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:07.860]
I hit the whole thing.

[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:10.180]
And it tastes like crap.

[02:19:11.980 --> 02:19:12.880]
Oh, God.

[02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:15.700]
I'd rather croak than eat another one of these.

[02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:17.480]
And George is wondering how come you're eating it?

[02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:18.060]
I don't know.

[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:19.420]
I felt like it.

[02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:21.280]
What's sitting here?

[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:26.260]
Man, I'd rather eat the speaking of that guy with his chewwawa.

[02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:29.040]
I'd rather eat a half a pound of chewawa droppings than this.

[02:19:29.740 --> 02:19:30.100]
Garbage.

[02:19:31.900 --> 02:19:36.340]
Man, Dr. Atkins, how could you put your name on something that is so grotesque?

[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:38.360]
Guy, how could you do it?

[02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:40.340]
Guy with.

[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:43.000]
And that's what makes you do, too, by the way.

[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:44.680]
If he had enough of that, makes you wish a lot.

[02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:46.120]
5.670560.

[02:19:46.780 --> 02:19:47.280]
QAM, hello.

[02:19:47.500 --> 02:19:47.760]
Deal.

[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:48.360]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:48.420 --> 02:19:50.120]
I know an Italian restaurant you've been to.

[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:51.700]
It's called Pinga Denture to Walk.

[02:19:51.820 --> 02:19:52.900]
Yeah, how pinga this, OK?

[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:54.300]
One track, Cuban, another one.

[02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:55.260]
One track, mine.

[02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:57.620]
Pinga, pinga, pinga, pinga, pinga, pinga, pinga, pinga, pinga.

[02:19:57.700 --> 02:19:58.160]
That's it.

[02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:02.180]
I'd be embarrassed.

[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:02.920]
I don't know why you're searching.

[02:20:03.140 --> 02:20:03.780]
What's in New York?

[02:20:03.940 --> 02:20:04.600]
What are you talking about?

[02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:05.660]
I would have been in the open.

[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:06.320]
I was just kidding.

[02:20:06.540 --> 02:20:07.300]
In New York, I was just kidding.

[02:20:07.300 --> 02:20:07.400]
In New York, I was just kidding.

[02:20:07.460 --> 02:20:07.980]
In New York, I was just kidding.

[02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:09.100]
In New York, I was just kidding.

[02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:14.340]
In New York, I was just kidding.

[02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:16.900]
QAM, not the Marriolitos.

[02:20:17.180 --> 02:20:17.720]
QAM, hello.

[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:19.080]
What the hell is that, Neo?

[02:20:19.540 --> 02:20:23.060]
The only place in America, you always see people going up and down the street still in the rubber raft.

[02:20:23.500 --> 02:20:23.860]
Unbelievable.

[02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:25.600]
Thank God we're right down by sea level.

[02:20:25.900 --> 02:20:28.500]
Neo, I overheard that the Monaco's coming to town.

[02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:29.120]
What?

[02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:30.660]
Monaco is coming to town.

[02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:32.080]
Monaco is coming to town.

[02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:33.160]
Oh, Monaco, Lewinsky.

[02:20:33.380 --> 02:20:33.620]
And?

[02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:34.440]
Is she?

[02:20:34.740 --> 02:20:35.860]
I don't know and I don't care.

[02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:38.320]
Well, in a second.

[02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:40.260]
Do you care whether she's coming to town?

[02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:42.360]
What's the matter of fact, I wanted to get in autographs.

[02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:43.060]
For what?

[02:20:43.980 --> 02:20:45.080]
Well, that's a collectible.

[02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:46.080]
Yeah, okay.

[02:20:46.260 --> 02:20:46.880]
Good luck to you, sir.

[02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:47.740]
Another no life.

[02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:49.440]
Send him a cheer life.

[02:20:50.780 --> 02:20:52.180]
We're going to start taking phone numbers.

[02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:53.540]
All you people in no lives at all.

[02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:54.460]
We'll send you a cheer life.

[02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:55.780]
Okay, maybe you can sprout something.

[02:20:55.980 --> 02:20:56.540]
All the way down it.

[02:20:58.280 --> 02:20:58.800]
WQAM, hello.

[02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:00.320]
Hello, Neo.

[02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:00.740]
Yes, sir.

[02:21:01.180 --> 02:21:01.700]
How are you doing?

[02:21:02.020 --> 02:21:02.180]
Great.

[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:07.840]
Just a little milk for you and your caller is about a Y2K situation.

[02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:09.280]
Oh, here we go, man.

[02:21:09.340 --> 02:21:10.260]
Wow, no, wait a minute.

[02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:11.140]
Look at my shovel out.

[02:21:11.300 --> 02:21:11.420]
Okay.

[02:21:11.420 --> 02:21:12.980]
Real quick.

[02:21:14.060 --> 02:21:17.580]
I'm going to need a mail this morning from a good friend of mine in Hawaii, never.

[02:21:18.540 --> 02:21:18.720]
Yeah.

[02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:21.800]
How's Jack going to do it?

[02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:23.400]
It's about these doing great.

[02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:26.240]
It's about the VCR setup.

[02:21:26.460 --> 02:21:37.760]
And people who are selling VCRs are telling most of the consumers that they can not advance, record anything once the year 2000,

[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:39.480]
unless you get one that's updated.

[02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:42.040]
So you need to buy one, a new one that's updated.

[02:21:42.340 --> 02:21:43.060]
That's not true.

[02:21:43.500 --> 02:21:43.500]

[02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:48.960]
The thing that everybody needs to do is set your VCRs back to 1972.

[02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:53.320]
That's the same calendar year, exists as the year 2000.

[02:21:53.700 --> 02:21:53.860]
Right.

[02:21:54.260 --> 02:21:57.140]
And you'll never have to buy another VCR until it breaks out.

[02:21:57.260 --> 02:22:00.240]
So then you won't have a 2K problem.

[02:22:01.300 --> 02:22:01.740]
Okay.

[02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:03.560]
Let's just roll note that passed along.

[02:22:03.740 --> 02:22:04.340]
Thanks a lot, Neo.

[02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:05.080]
Thank you so much.

[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:05.500]
All righty.

[02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:05.740]
There you go.

[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:06.760]
There's some good advice for you.

[02:22:06.860 --> 02:22:06.940]
Okay.

[02:22:07.080 --> 02:22:08.080]
There's some sound advice.

[02:22:08.700 --> 02:22:11.340]
Instead of getting ripped off and going out and throwing your VCR on the trash.

[02:22:11.920 --> 02:22:19.360]
And probably whoever told you that wants to go and check your trash in the morning while you're sleeping and pick out your old appliances out of there that you threw up because they fed you a bunch of horse crap.

[02:22:21.880 --> 02:22:28.080]
So tragically said, you know, in Denver just a couple days ago, I told you they tested the whole thing with a Y2K with the power and the, uh...

[02:22:28.860 --> 02:22:29.340]
Now what was that?

[02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:30.640]
What is doing the beeping?

[02:22:30.640 --> 02:22:31.600]
It's something over here.

[02:22:32.060 --> 02:22:34.700]
It's either in the, uh... it's in one of these things over here.

[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:37.480]
Now, and then did you plug this back in, by the way?

[02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:37.920]
No.

[02:22:38.100 --> 02:22:38.220]
No.

[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:45.760]
This connected me from the outside world on my fax machine that I'm waiting breathlessly for something that I actually might have some interest in.

[02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:53.860]
And there's a beeping coming from like, uh... either the DCS or there's some monitor down here or the phone or the bottles of water on the floor from the Colorgon man.

[02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:55.760]
Something is beeping over here, okay?

[02:22:57.300 --> 02:22:58.260]
It might be what?

[02:22:58.800 --> 02:22:59.860]
How could it be the phone?

[02:22:59.860 --> 02:23:03.260]
It makes like someone who's not on one side of someone's body.

[02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:05.480]
Hey, it might as well be unplugged, okay?

[02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:07.780]
Maybe the phone is rebelling against the screenless.

[02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:08.780]
I don't have any idea.

[02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:15.380]
It's the Greg Reed FNWay man, the bush league, the cheapest, the most amateur hour, the most bush league.

[02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:20.240]
And these people that work in this joint, I've never seen such a bunch of hundredlings in my life.

[02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:22.260]
Whatever swill he throws their way.

[02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:24.280]
They just got their tongue out all the way on the floor.

[02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:27.740]
I come in here in the morning and they're all out there with their tongues, lapping it off the floor.

[02:23:27.740 --> 02:23:28.680]
Oh, yes, Greg.

[02:23:28.860 --> 02:23:29.240]
Yes, Max.

[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:29.860]
Yes, Max.

[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:30.720]
And what do you say, Max?

[02:23:31.720 --> 02:23:32.800]
And he's going, huh?

[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:34.860]
Are you scratching that spot on his head?

[02:23:35.180 --> 02:23:35.360]
Huh?

[02:23:38.140 --> 02:23:38.500]
WQAM.

[02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:39.900]
Hello, Neil.

[02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:40.460]
Yes, sir.

[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:41.700]
I remember the famous.

[02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:43.060]
Here's a guy.

[02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:44.840]
I remember the restaurant that's worth talking about.

[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:47.420]
I remember the cafeteria that was right down the street from it.

[02:23:47.620 --> 02:23:47.980]
What's that?

[02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:49.180]
I remember the name of it.

[02:23:49.240 --> 02:23:50.080]
I just remember going there.

[02:23:50.380 --> 02:23:50.560]
Yeah.

[02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:53.820]
It was a real focuffellate used to hang out there a lot.

[02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:57.800]
But it was a very good cafeteria and the restaurant was there.

[02:23:57.820 --> 02:23:59.140]
I'm not talking about a cafeteria.

[02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:00.380]
I'm talking about the famous.

[02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:01.580]
Who cares about a cafeteria?

[02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:02.780]
Well, you got to remember it.

[02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:03.560]
It was right down the street.

[02:24:03.980 --> 02:24:04.400]
Right on call.

[02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:05.020]
Yeah, good.

[02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:07.040]
So it's some derelicts right down the street, too.

[02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:07.360]
Okay.

[02:24:07.580 --> 02:24:10.320]
Here's the guy that remembers the famous and he wants us to talk about it.

[02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:11.740]
No, he wants to talk about a cafeteria.

[02:24:11.940 --> 02:24:12.680]
Does he know the name of it?

[02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:13.060]
No.

[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:13.340]
No.

[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:15.520]
That's...

[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:16.100]
There you go.

[02:24:16.340 --> 02:24:17.860]
Oh, send him a chialife, okay?

[02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:21.800]
Send this guy to chialize in case the first one commits suicide.

[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:24.300]
Even without Dr. Jack.

[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:27.180]
Man, that was a great call, sir.

[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:31.980]
God bless you for letting all our visitors understand what this place is all about.

[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:32.940]
That was beautiful.

[02:24:33.980 --> 02:24:34.740]
What is that?

[02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:36.560]
That's machine ink.

[02:24:36.780 --> 02:24:37.460]
I'll change it in a second.

[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:39.280]
But we've got the problem.

[02:24:39.940 --> 02:24:40.360]
But we've got the problem.

[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:40.800]
But we've got the problem.

[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:42.300]
Don't let him take it away, though.

[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:44.480]
Once we get a hold of it, don't take it away.

[02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:45.200]
We'll never see it again.

[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:47.820]
There's a beeping over on this side.

[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:48.540]
There's something beeping.

[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:51.140]
Not now, like, intermentally.

[02:24:51.140 --> 02:24:53.460]
Every now and then, like, yeah, once in a while.

[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:56.420]
Maybe it's Josh Friedman.

[02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:57.600]
Maybe he's in the...

[02:24:57.600 --> 02:24:58.420]
Maybe it's Fatboy.

[02:24:58.580 --> 02:24:59.840]
Maybe he's in the other room and...

[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:01.260]
He's beeping on it.

[02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:02.400]
Are you Aaron?

[02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:03.260]
Shit like this.

[02:25:11.260 --> 02:25:15.740]
I'm dreaming of a white neighbor.

[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.240]
Just like one who I used to know.

[02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:21.940]
Yes!

[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:29.460]
Where are the longs for trims and far's atrims?

[02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:29.880]
Yes!

[02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:33.540]
So very long ago.

[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:42.440]
I'm dreaming of a white neighbor.

[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:43.540]
All right.

[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:47.420]
With every force, you'll find I'm right.

[02:25:48.420 --> 02:25:54.420]
Take your days, be very and bright.

[02:26:01.100 --> 02:26:03.520]
Man, name.

[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:09.420]
All the people, never give up.

[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:15.320]
He why don't you give up?

[02:26:22.380 --> 02:26:23.180]
132-560.

[02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:26.040]
WDQM got that Goldberg short too from Shulestek.

[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:26.920]
Six o'clock.

[02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:27.740]
We got Donnie B.

[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:28.760]
Talking baseball.

[02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:29.640]
Any interest?

[02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:29.920]
No.

[02:26:30.180 --> 02:26:31.020]
And 635.

[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:33.100]
We got the Marlins in the match in New York again.

[02:26:33.540 --> 02:26:34.540]
Another disaster coming up.

[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:38.080]
And also we got the Panthers on 790 on Waxi.

[02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:38.900]
Panthers...

[02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:39.720]
What does that say?

[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:41.300]
Oh, they got the right team.

[02:26:41.420 --> 02:26:44.620]
Montreal Canadians are last game at the arena for some of us at the Macarena.

[02:26:44.620 --> 02:26:46.180]
They will play Tampa Bay on Saturday.

[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:46.880]
Are we going to that?

[02:26:47.100 --> 02:26:47.280]
No.

[02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:48.160]
Not if you got a brain.

[02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:49.940]
Not if you have any kind of a life at all.

[02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:52.720]
WDQM, hello.

[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:54.200]
I'm just here to defend myself.

[02:26:56.340 --> 02:26:57.400]
The indefensible, OK?

[02:26:57.840 --> 02:26:58.200]
Asshole.

[02:26:58.580 --> 02:27:01.360]
Major obnoxious oozing and disgusting asshole.

[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:02.860]
WDQM, hello.

[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:03.840]
Yeah.

[02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:04.780]
Is this Neil?

[02:27:04.940 --> 02:27:05.280]
Yes, sir.

[02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:08.000]
Neil, did they mention Piper High on that book at all?

[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:08.920]
APX?

[02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:10.040]
In what book?

[02:27:11.060 --> 02:27:11.940]
The best of.

[02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:15.300]
Oh, did they mention Piper High on the City Line?

[02:27:15.980 --> 02:27:16.240]
Yes.

[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:17.060]
Not that I saw.

[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:19.560]
Now they said the best station was Zeta.

[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:20.560]
OK.

[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:22.880]
I think Captain Ovo paid him off or else, you know,

[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:24.140]
blew somebody over there for this one.

[02:27:24.980 --> 02:27:26.080]
Because they gave us Zeta.

[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:27.300]
They were raving about Zeta.

[02:27:27.380 --> 02:27:28.420]
Anybody I know listen to Zeta?

[02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:28.680]
No.

[02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:28.900]

[02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:31.560]
I remember when Zeta used to be good in the morning.

[02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:33.340]
WDQM, hello.

[02:27:34.140 --> 02:27:34.520]
Hey Neil.

[02:27:34.660 --> 02:27:34.960]
Yes, sir.

[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:37.540]
Do you know if any good Hawaiian restaurants are the main ones?

[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:38.340]
Yeah, Monokai.

[02:27:40.580 --> 02:27:41.180]
WDQM, hello.

[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:43.520]
QAM.

[02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:47.020]
WDQM, hello.

[02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:48.200]
Hello, Neil.

[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:48.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:49.440]
I got one for you.

[02:27:49.540 --> 02:27:50.400]
Genes 5 and 10.

[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:51.340]
Restaurant.

[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:52.260]
What is it?

[02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:54.360]
Genes 5 and 10 in North Miami.

[02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:54.960]
Uh-huh.

[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:55.320]
Chronic.

[02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:57.360]
Chronic.

[02:27:58.780 --> 02:28:01.000]
What do you mean that's one of the chronic Holyotes?

[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:01.980]
Yeah, that voice.

[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:02.360]
That voice.

[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:02.560]
That genes 5.

[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:03.160]
Who knows?

[02:28:03.420 --> 02:28:04.820]
It doesn't make any difference what it is.

[02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:05.680]
It's nothing.

[02:28:05.860 --> 02:28:06.380]
It's kaka.

[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:08.140]
It's like everything that comes out of his mouth.

[02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:08.980]
It's bad.

[02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:11.140]
It comes out of every orifice in his body.

[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:13.800]
WDQM, hello.

[02:28:16.820 --> 02:28:17.400]
WDQM, hello.

[02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:18.700]
Uncle Neil.

[02:28:18.860 --> 02:28:19.140]
Yes, sir.

[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:20.540]
What's up with your Gatza Mishbuka?

[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:21.100]
How you doing?

[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:21.720]
Okay.

[02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:23.360]
You're looking for good old restaurants?

[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:24.500]
No, I'm not.

[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:27.980]
I was talking about an article about the famous restaurant.

[02:28:28.260 --> 02:28:29.820]
I'm not looking for a good old restaurant.

[02:28:30.180 --> 02:28:31.960]
I'm talking about a specific old restaurant.

[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:36.560]
And I get a guy that tells me about a cafeteria up the road somewhere where they eat in horse meat or something.

[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:39.460]
Well, give me a little clue and I could probably tell you what it is.

[02:28:39.580 --> 02:28:39.980]
I know everything.

[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:40.820]
No clue of what?

[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:42.760]
What's the old one you're looking for?

[02:28:46.620 --> 02:28:47.640]
What does that mean?

[02:28:47.980 --> 02:28:48.720]
What does that mean?

[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:49.800]
All right.

[02:28:49.980 --> 02:28:50.760]
Let me cut to the chase.

[02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:51.440]
Can I have the tickets?

[02:28:52.580 --> 02:28:53.740]
The tickets for what?

[02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:54.680]
The lighting.

[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:03.600]
WQM, hello.

[02:29:04.500 --> 02:29:05.460]
Hello, Neil.

[02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:06.020]
Yes.

[02:29:06.020 --> 02:29:07.160]
Hey, Neil. What's going on?

[02:29:07.220 --> 02:29:07.700]
I don't know.

[02:29:07.820 --> 02:29:08.380]
It's a magic question.

[02:29:08.380 --> 02:29:08.820]
I was here.

[02:29:09.020 --> 02:29:11.120]
You, uh, poke fun of a book, shall we?

[02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:12.180]
Yeah.

[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:14.060]
How big is the man?

[02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:14.840]
480.

[02:29:16.100 --> 02:29:17.060]
For real?

[02:29:17.260 --> 02:29:18.400]
570, 480.

[02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:22.360]
560, 530.

[02:29:23.860 --> 02:29:24.880]
That's a good old egg.

[02:29:25.220 --> 02:29:26.820]
A foot three, 620 pounds.

[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:29.280]
What would you say the boosters go on these days?

[02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:30.700]
400 easy?

[02:29:31.620 --> 02:29:32.040]
That's all.

[02:29:32.340 --> 02:29:32.660]
Really?

[02:29:33.180 --> 02:29:33.600]
No, wait a minute.

[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:34.580]
I'm asking Jill Castello.

[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:35.680]
380?

[02:29:37.700 --> 02:29:38.800]
310, my ass.

[02:29:39.260 --> 02:29:41.320]
And believe me, my ass is about 310.

[02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:42.460]
I'd say 330.

[02:29:42.820 --> 02:29:43.040]
Wow.

[02:29:43.300 --> 02:29:44.440]
And he's been doing it for five years.

[02:29:44.760 --> 02:29:44.860]
Huh?

[02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:45.440]
Five eight?

[02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:46.020]
Five three.

[02:29:46.580 --> 02:29:46.980]
No.

[02:29:47.400 --> 02:29:48.100]
Like the beast, yeah.

[02:29:48.140 --> 02:29:51.200]
So he's sort of like, uh, what's the guy with a channel six?

[02:29:52.160 --> 02:29:52.500]
David?

[02:29:52.980 --> 02:29:53.340]
Oh, no.

[02:29:53.480 --> 02:29:54.540]
David Games, much taller.

[02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:57.340]
David Shamby comes up to David Games, Pupik.

[02:29:57.800 --> 02:29:59.600]
I don't remember when you were pretty fat, man.

[02:29:59.640 --> 02:30:01.700]
I thought you'd like about 12, 13 years ago.

[02:30:01.820 --> 02:30:02.000]
Yeah.

[02:30:02.320 --> 02:30:03.280]
And you did a pretty good job.

[02:30:03.660 --> 02:30:04.840]
I'm like, boo Shamby, sir.

[02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:05.300]
I have never.

[02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:08.480]
And then believe me, I looked like a big fat slide when I was that fat.

[02:30:08.580 --> 02:30:09.340]
I was a big fat slide.

[02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:11.280]
I'm a little chubby now, but not like that.

[02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:13.980]
Around this part, they call me slim around here now.

[02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:16.480]
Well, if you want to look good, just stand next to boo.

[02:30:16.780 --> 02:30:17.100]
Okay.

[02:30:17.300 --> 02:30:17.780]
All right, I'll go.

[02:30:17.960 --> 02:30:18.200]
Thanks.

[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:19.200]
Joe had a good idea.

[02:30:19.820 --> 02:30:23.740]
We could do an office pool, guess boo's wait, and have a weigh-in on your scale there.

[02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:25.400]
Well, that's a good idea.

[02:30:25.900 --> 02:30:27.300]
Only who the hell's going to get a hold of him?

[02:30:27.360 --> 02:30:28.100]
He won't come in for that.

[02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:29.740]
He's very uptight about that, I understand.

[02:30:30.420 --> 02:30:31.100]
Yeah, he's a good guy.

[02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:35.380]
I saw him in the restroom there that he had some of the henna stuff he was doing on his

[02:30:35.380 --> 02:30:35.540]
hair.

[02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:38.280]
That's what you do in boo, and he says, I'm dying on the wind.

[02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:42.320]
I mean, nobody really has orange hair.

[02:30:42.540 --> 02:30:43.480]
Okay, only in comic books.

[02:30:43.740 --> 02:30:46.920]
Comic book characters have purple hair, blue hair, and orange hair.

[02:30:47.220 --> 02:30:49.300]
Now down here in South Florida, we do have much blue hair.

[02:30:49.720 --> 02:30:50.420]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:30:50.520 --> 02:30:50.780]
Oh!

[02:30:50.920 --> 02:30:51.460]
I think you do.

[02:30:52.020 --> 02:30:53.600]
But orange hair and purple hair, uh-uh.

[02:30:54.040 --> 02:30:55.540]
Only in comic books and boogsters.

[02:30:56.520 --> 02:30:59.560]
In fact, I heard somebody refer to him the other day as the old redhead, which of course

[02:30:59.560 --> 02:31:02.740]
was red barber, the old orangehead, boogshobby, and a Marlon broadcaster.

[02:31:02.820 --> 02:31:03.060]
Oh!

[02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:05.120]
WQAM, hello.

[02:31:05.660 --> 02:31:07.620]
Wimmer is looking for brown eye.

[02:31:08.680 --> 02:31:09.360]
WQAM, hello.

[02:31:09.880 --> 02:31:10.600]
Hey, Joe, how's it going?

[02:31:10.820 --> 02:31:11.040]
Okay.

[02:31:11.520 --> 02:31:12.220]
Can I stick with Neil?

[02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:12.800]
No chance.

[02:31:14.140 --> 02:31:14.860]
WQAM, hello.

[02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:16.780]
You know, the famous was great.

[02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:17.260]
Yeah.

[02:31:17.980 --> 02:31:20.800]
And with the salsa bottles and the conishes on the table.

[02:31:21.020 --> 02:31:21.860]
And you actually ate there.

[02:31:22.320 --> 02:31:22.480]
Yeah.

[02:31:22.940 --> 02:31:24.800]
And left with a lot of heartbreak.

[02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:25.380]
Uh-huh.

[02:31:25.960 --> 02:31:26.920]
But it was all you good.

[02:31:28.100 --> 02:31:29.840]
Tough cabbage, the dharma, all that crap.

[02:31:30.020 --> 02:31:30.180]
Yeah.

[02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:31.400]
The kiski.

[02:31:31.940 --> 02:31:32.780]
Kiski, all that stuff.

[02:31:32.860 --> 02:31:33.240]
Oh, go ahead.

[02:31:33.300 --> 02:31:33.980]
Glad you had a good meal.

[02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:34.940]
Okay, let one out.

[02:31:35.580 --> 02:31:36.620]
Okay, it feels better now.

[02:31:37.580 --> 02:31:37.900]
WQAM.

[02:31:38.660 --> 02:31:38.980]
Hello.

[02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:39.540]
Yes, sir.

[02:31:40.020 --> 02:31:40.660]
Hi, this is Neil.

[02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:41.220]
Speaking.

[02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:43.480]
Is this George?

[02:31:43.960 --> 02:31:44.800]
No, it's not George.

[02:31:45.060 --> 02:31:47.080]
If you want me to tell you I'm George, I'm George.

[02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:47.920]
Okay, Kephasa.

[02:31:48.260 --> 02:31:48.560]
Kephasa.

[02:31:48.920 --> 02:31:49.320]
How are you doing?

[02:31:49.480 --> 02:31:50.360]
Okay, Kephasa.

[02:31:50.580 --> 02:31:50.980]
Oh, sorry.

[02:31:51.020 --> 02:31:51.980]
I was just listening to the radio.

[02:31:52.160 --> 02:31:53.220]
Well, I'm doing screen-list today.

[02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:53.920]
How could it be George?

[02:31:53.980 --> 02:31:55.020]
He's not answering the phone.

[02:31:55.020 --> 02:31:56.280]
He's sitting in there with his head in his hands,

[02:31:56.280 --> 02:31:57.940]
wondering, uh, contemplating his life.

[02:31:58.140 --> 02:31:58.580]
Oh, no.

[02:31:59.260 --> 02:32:00.520]
Well, listen, I just want to tell you,

[02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:02.200]
the Boston Bruins have taken the cup this year.

[02:32:02.380 --> 02:32:02.600]
Yeah.

[02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:03.740]
You want to tell me.

[02:32:03.840 --> 02:32:05.180]
Like that, like that, like that, say, uh,

[02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:06.620]
because you say it, it makes it so.

[02:32:06.780 --> 02:32:07.080]
Exactly.

[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:07.940]
You only cuped it,

[02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:10.300]
and I have this one on their, uh, on their private, okay?

[02:32:10.460 --> 02:32:10.760]
Uh-huh.

[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:12.600]
I don't know where he's like, they do air every year, sir.

[02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:13.660]
They got a nice team.

[02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:14.560]
They're not going anywhere.

[02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:15.900]
They'll never survive the first round.

[02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:17.100]
That's what everybody else tells me.

[02:32:17.220 --> 02:32:17.800]
And then they're right.

[02:32:18.060 --> 02:32:18.840]
They got a nice team.

[02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:20.260]
I like to end Pat Bruins' great,

[02:32:20.260 --> 02:32:22.000]
but you'll never make it past the first round.

[02:32:22.280 --> 02:32:22.940]
Trust me, okay?

[02:32:23.020 --> 02:32:24.640]
I'm here to tell you, don't bet the ranch.

[02:32:24.920 --> 02:32:25.760]
They're not going anywhere.

[02:32:28.220 --> 02:32:30.180]
He's here to tell me they're going to take the cup.

[02:32:30.380 --> 02:32:31.160]
Uh-uh.

[02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:34.000]
Call one of the sports shows and talk crap like that, okay?

[02:32:34.780 --> 02:32:36.680]
And by the way, since you're so draft-intensive,

[02:32:36.920 --> 02:32:39.500]
how about suggesting the dolphins might draft a couple of white guys, huh?

[02:32:39.520 --> 02:32:39.700]
Ah!

[02:32:39.820 --> 02:32:41.580]
All right. It's just for variety, all right?

[02:32:44.380 --> 02:32:45.980]
You're looking for glory holes.

[02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:57.040]
See you other night I watched a wrestling match with big smooth men with sweaty tracks.

[02:32:57.200 --> 02:33:00.560]
They would try to grab each other's ass,

[02:33:00.920 --> 02:33:04.360]
wearing something more than a tiny g-strap.

[02:33:05.120 --> 02:33:10.440]
But when they rang the bell and the match was over,

[02:33:12.760 --> 02:33:18.500]
I couldn't help but notice I had a big boner.

[02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:20.900]
Yeah, I want a wee wrestler.

[02:33:22.280 --> 02:33:22.600]
Okay!

[02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:26.300]
And have a man's crotch wrapped around my mouth.

[02:33:26.480 --> 02:33:26.660]
Yeah.

[02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:28.340]
I want a wee wrestler.

[02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:29.420]
Press the wrestler.

[02:33:30.700 --> 02:33:33.640]
It's just pushing inside and out.

[02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:34.180]
Welcome.

[02:33:34.500 --> 02:33:37.220]
Oh, I admit it seems a little gay.

[02:33:37.900 --> 02:33:41.160]
Stick my hand between another man's legs.

[02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:41.920]
All right.

[02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:44.240]
So when I pull my hands away,

[02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:46.720]
I get to sell my fingers.

[02:33:48.260 --> 02:33:51.800]
You know that other than some time to train,

[02:33:52.500 --> 02:33:55.460]
you don't need to have much of a brain,

[02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:59.160]
as long as in the shower after you work out.

[02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:02.820]
You don't mind lacing someone's balls in your mouth.

[02:34:03.820 --> 02:34:09.480]
I know that white scenes can be messy and too melty.

[02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:15.940]
That's why they like to rub that KY on their belly.

[02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:19.560]
I want a wee wrestler.

[02:34:21.820 --> 02:34:24.840]
And retaining more runs just like you.

[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:25.320]
Or you?

[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:26.880]
I want a wee wrestler.

[02:34:28.260 --> 02:34:32.420]
And maybe run for governor too.

[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:36.040]
As long as it attracts the crowd,

[02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:39.680]
I don't mind going down.

[02:34:40.260 --> 02:34:46.160]
I don't rub it in these illnesses or locks with the clumpy queers.

[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:50.040]
144 at 560 W. Cam, we're doing an office pool.

[02:34:50.460 --> 02:34:52.180]
We got a big plastic bucket.

[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:56.720]
We thought just say it and to get the plastic bucket.

[02:34:57.360 --> 02:35:00.500]
And we'll take an office pool up on how much the books directly weighs.

[02:35:01.660 --> 02:35:03.440]
I'm guessing what did I say 290?

[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:05.600]
I'm going for 390.

[02:35:06.660 --> 02:35:08.100]
George is putting in for 300.

[02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:09.900]
Joe Castellos says 310.

[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:12.240]
We're putting 5 bucks a piece in the big plastic bucket.

[02:35:12.980 --> 02:35:15.280]
Just say get in the rhymes with bucket.

[02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:18.460]
And whoever is the closest wins the pool.

[02:35:18.460 --> 02:35:20.080]
The book pool.

[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:23.340]
Now you do understand we got a way till he comes back from the road trip.

[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:27.380]
Oh you know, in the way to me, we never thought about that.

[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:29.880]
We got a factor in he's in New York with all those great restaurants.

[02:35:31.560 --> 02:35:33.980]
We got a factor in how, now when do the marlins come back home?

[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:35.140]
What day do we know have any idea?

[02:35:35.420 --> 02:35:38.520]
Joe will have to look that up with the sports nerds and find out when the marlins come back home.

[02:35:39.100 --> 02:35:40.800]
All you guys out there that are going to enter the pool.

[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:41.500]
Keep that in mind.

[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:46.600]
You might want to adjust and evaluate your guess based on how much poundage you can add on

[02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:48.880]
while he's in the big city.

[02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:50.920]
WQAM.

[02:35:51.820 --> 02:35:52.180]
Neil.

[02:35:52.380 --> 02:35:52.680]
Yes sir.

[02:35:52.860 --> 02:35:53.420]
You know what I think?

[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:55.180]
I think we should put him on the advantage bars.

[02:35:56.040 --> 02:35:57.140]
The disadvantage bars?

[02:35:57.580 --> 02:35:57.760]
Yeah.

[02:35:58.300 --> 02:36:00.860]
I get around to bowl 160 in about three weeks.

[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:04.640]
Listen, I say 317 baby.

[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:06.180]
Have you ever a, have you seen him?

[02:36:06.820 --> 02:36:07.460]
I've seen it.

[02:36:07.660 --> 02:36:08.460]
I saw him once.

[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:10.460]
But I think he's bigger now.

[02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:11.500]
How long ago was that?

[02:36:12.260 --> 02:36:14.160]
I think it was like 70 months ago.

[02:36:14.220 --> 02:36:14.900]
Oh forget it.

[02:36:14.900 --> 02:36:17.800]
You're not, you're not even in this year's, that was last year's pool poundage try.

[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:19.560]
Now seriously, he's ballooned up.

[02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:21.380]
In fact, that's our next poll question.

[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:23.020]
Who's, who's ballooning up faster?

[02:36:23.620 --> 02:36:24.980]
Jeff D. Flourist or the Booster?

[02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:26.980]
I mean, I'm not saying D. Flour is anywhere near that weight.

[02:36:27.220 --> 02:36:30.960]
But if he keeps going into this pace, if Booster slows down just a little bit,

[02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:35.280]
the D. Flour might catch him because every morning you can, you can see him expanding.

[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:39.200]
It's like watching one of those slow mo freeze frames thing, you know,

[02:36:39.260 --> 02:36:41.720]
you can seem getting a little bigger and bigger and bigger.

[02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:43.480]
Scary.

[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:45.060]
It's the fat joint.

[02:36:45.580 --> 02:36:47.500]
Anybody out there ever seen a fat joint?

[02:36:47.660 --> 02:36:47.900]
Yes.

[02:36:48.460 --> 02:36:49.440]
A QAM, hello.

[02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:50.440]
Hello, no.

[02:36:50.660 --> 02:36:50.860]
Yes.

[02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:51.880]
How are you?

[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:52.240]
Okay.

[02:36:52.900 --> 02:36:56.560]
Over in Pimper Pment for your eckens, the gnashing.

[02:36:56.900 --> 02:36:57.080]
Yes.

[02:36:57.340 --> 02:36:59.220]
There's a place called Delight.

[02:36:59.720 --> 02:37:00.700]
They're all over the place.

[02:37:00.800 --> 02:37:01.600]
Listen, listen.

[02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:04.020]
They've got good, good soft.

[02:37:04.580 --> 02:37:05.500]
It's very good.

[02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:06.220]
It's good and soft.

[02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:06.780]
I like it when I talk.

[02:37:06.780 --> 02:37:07.560]
Trust me when I talk.

[02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:09.540]
You know, another good soft what?

[02:37:11.820 --> 02:37:14.560]
Chocolate, vanilla, all kinds of different flavors.

[02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:15.500]
They've got everything.

[02:37:15.500 --> 02:37:16.040]
Oh, what?

[02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:18.120]
I was like yogurt and stuff.

[02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:19.180]
Yogurt and stuff?

[02:37:19.460 --> 02:37:19.620]
But it's good.

[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:24.220]
Trust me, it's better than like having a state to eat in between meals.

[02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:26.900]
It's the in that advantage stuff.

[02:37:27.660 --> 02:37:28.660]
I wouldn't wish that on an eating.

[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:29.320]
Absolutely.

[02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:30.240]
I spit it out.

[02:37:30.380 --> 02:37:31.460]
I went back and got my back back.

[02:37:31.460 --> 02:37:32.300]
I always spit it out too.

[02:37:32.380 --> 02:37:32.860]
That's a good idea.

[02:37:32.980 --> 02:37:34.060]
What I mean is going around these days.

[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:34.620]
Good idea.

[02:37:35.180 --> 02:37:36.600]
When in doubt, spit it out.

[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:38.680]
WQAM, hello.

[02:37:40.660 --> 02:37:40.980]
QAM.

[02:37:41.420 --> 02:37:41.740]
Hello?

[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:42.300]
Yes, sir.

[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:42.900]
Yes.

[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:44.500]
Neil, you look like a fat toad.

[02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:46.040]
Okay, thank you.

[02:37:47.100 --> 02:37:47.620]
WQAM, hello.

[02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:49.180]
That's the highest compliment I've had this year.

[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:49.640]
QAM.

[02:37:50.740 --> 02:37:51.060]
Hello?

[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:51.540]
Yes, sir.

[02:37:51.780 --> 02:37:52.200]
How are you doing, Neil?

[02:37:52.340 --> 02:37:52.440]
Okay.

[02:37:52.780 --> 02:37:53.240]
This is what I got.

[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:54.340]
QP is for you.

[02:37:54.580 --> 02:37:54.720]
Yeah.

[02:37:55.060 --> 02:37:56.540]
If the Pope ever ate something from the kiss,

[02:37:56.540 --> 02:37:57.400]
it'd say, just me on first.

[02:37:57.620 --> 02:37:57.940]
WQAM.

[02:37:58.920 --> 02:37:59.240]
WQAM.

[02:37:59.320 --> 02:37:59.440]
Hello.

[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:02.120]
QAM.

[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:02.900]
Neil.

[02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:03.420]
Yes, sir.

[02:38:03.860 --> 02:38:04.260]
Big report.

[02:38:04.820 --> 02:38:05.040]
Yeah.

[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:06.180]
I just saw a book.

[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:09.000]
Yeah.

[02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:10.500]
Week.

[02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:11.200]
Isn't that pathetic?

[02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:14.160]
Week and week and it gets weaker and weaker.

[02:38:14.460 --> 02:38:16.920]
You can't complain about their material because they don't have it.

[02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:17.520]
Week.

[02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:20.140]
WQAM, hello.

[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:23.680]
QAM.

[02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:24.080]

[02:38:24.220 --> 02:38:24.440]
QAM.

[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:25.540]
345 pounds.

[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:27.960]
Okay, we'll lose some weight fat, so.

[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:29.380]
WQAM, hello.

[02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:30.900]
Hello.

[02:38:31.220 --> 02:38:31.520]
Yes, sir.

[02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:32.780]
Yeah, it's a good meal.

[02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:33.740]
Speaking.

[02:38:34.540 --> 02:38:40.600]
Still, Johnny, oh, listen, I want to thank you about Johnny, Johnny, oh, Johnny, oh, oh, from

[02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:42.580]
Colorado Springs, listen, my kids are from school.

[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:47.800]
I love to let them listen to your show, get to show them all the idiots that call up that, you know, I want to show them to

[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:50.920]
bunch of moms and grow up not to be like those moms calling in.

[02:38:51.140 --> 02:38:51.360]
Great.

[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:52.580]
All right, buddy.

[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:53.300]
Okay, Johnny.

[02:38:54.060 --> 02:38:54.740]
See ya.

[02:38:55.620 --> 02:38:57.940]
See how to, what's his name too, Fredo?

[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:01.300]
Wasn't Fredo, tight with Johnny, oh, nothing.

[02:39:01.900 --> 02:39:02.560]
Yeah, right.

[02:39:03.260 --> 02:39:04.840]
How about Superman, do you ever meet him?

[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:07.120]
WQAM, hello.

[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:08.280]
Hello, Neil.

[02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:08.740]
Yes, sir.

[02:39:09.540 --> 02:39:13.400]
I believe that the beef is coming from, yeah, from Uranus.

[02:39:13.980 --> 02:39:14.660]
WQAM, hello.

[02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:16.120]
Yes, Neil.

[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:16.600]
Yes, sir.

[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:19.340]
Hi, there's a big little bag in the church.

[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:23.060]
Yeah, and, and, and, I know that's it.

[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:24.140]
That's the point.

[02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:26.320]
And WQAM, hello.

[02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:28.460]
You're all up, bunch of the chicken eggs.

[02:39:29.240 --> 02:39:29.680]
WQAM.

[02:39:30.540 --> 02:39:31.680]
Neil, my queen.

[02:39:32.580 --> 02:39:33.200]
QAM, hello.

[02:39:33.860 --> 02:39:34.660]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:39:34.820 --> 02:39:35.200]
Okay, sir.

[02:39:35.740 --> 02:39:39.140]
There is no way a new stadium was going to make any difference for these marlins.

[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:40.400]
I don't know what they're thinking.

[02:39:40.900 --> 02:39:41.400]
What new stadium?

[02:39:41.580 --> 02:39:42.320]
What new stadium?

[02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:47.480]
I won't rest until I make sure that now one penny of public funds goes to building a new stadium.

[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:53.380]
No matter what the putt whackers, the sportswhackers around his joint, or the newspaper pours sportswhackers thing, a bunch of crap.

[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:54.560]
I agree with you.

[02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:55.680]
I mean, they may have a...

[02:39:55.680 --> 02:39:58.980]
There is absolutely, positively no interest whatsoever.

[02:39:59.380 --> 02:40:00.020]
Okay, and you know something?

[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:04.020]
I hate to break the news to the Mike Mayo and all these other dickheads that we got in his town.

[02:40:04.180 --> 02:40:08.000]
But the fact is that somehow we survived here, long before we had a baseball team.

[02:40:08.100 --> 02:40:08.300]
You know what?

[02:40:08.540 --> 02:40:09.300]
Somehow we got along.

[02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:10.200]
Absolutely.

[02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:10.920]
You know what will happen?

[02:40:11.020 --> 02:40:13.960]
The first few days everyone comes to take a team out, then we got to that.

[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:14.700]
It'll be dead again.

[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:18.440]
Just like Montreal where they had seven frogs in their last night and two of them were buffos.

[02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:20.280]
Take care, Neil.

[02:40:20.460 --> 02:40:21.220]
Okay, back at you.

[02:40:22.700 --> 02:40:24.580]
Stadium my fat ass, okay?
