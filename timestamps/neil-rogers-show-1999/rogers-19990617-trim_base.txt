[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.960]
word that food 10 on 3 at 5 60 WQAM happy Thursday 2 now what did you say we were debating about

[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.360]
given that stuff away what was it something a tarzan passes tarzan passes but they're not the

[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.680]
four Friday the weekend and Monday through Thursday their what is only Monday through Thursday passes

[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.660]
only at the end of the year it's the summertime today is the last day of school whatever you want to

[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.720]
do no I'm not just slow down a minute okay don't get ahead of yourself I'm just saying that what

[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.680]
difference does it make what day it is now that everybody's out of school and it's summertime

[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.100]
and I write about that uh-huh day in F&A no but I was going to say before I was so rudely interrupted

[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.220]
I was going to say that we haven't given anything away on the show since I think about August

[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.840]
and done tremendously well by the way thank you and I think that would be like a real sellout to do

[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.840]
that today you know as opposed to like going over the list of the top 5,000 actors and actresses see

[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.740]
the deal with that and I better not say it because that'll screw up the whole thing but the deal is

[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.840]
it's like it's like it's just and of course it's a follow-up a year later to what they did last year

[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.540]
with the 45,000 best movies I mean if you're compiling your own list of like your favorite movies

[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.960]
of all time I can do a top five or top 10 but like how do you do the top 100 how do you decide between

[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.060]
what what what's what is differentiates between like number 87 and number 88 you follow what I'm saying

[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.820]
what kind of nuance in the movie pushes it like up about a half a point between like 87 and a half

[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.280]
to 87 it's ridiculous I'm on the face of it now granted it's fun and it kills a lot of time

[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.920]
and it gets people really pissed off and they like fight about it because they like fighting about

[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.640]
a lot of crappy stuff that's unimportant but nevertheless and by the way in Morning Crout

[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.060]
carpet munchers I'm serious I mean you know I said it yesterday and evidently well we're

[00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.380]
getting the evidence right now you know same old crap again I mean would I ever take shots at

[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.460]
them on this show yeah why not I say all out war that's what I say it's gonna be a long hot

[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.220]
summer let's just beat the crap out of each other work the last time work like a charm huh

[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.940]
well of course see they let their callers do it and then they all get locked on at you yeah

[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:22.700]
they have nothing to say but beat that as it may oh this this is uh one of the great letters

[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.800]
every day I try to find a letter for you and either one of the papers and amazingly I'd say 95

[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:34.800]
percent of the day as I find one in the hero this morning rated our title please don't pay the

[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.440]
effort my neighbors from England are shocked to find a verb shagged in new acclaimed movie title teenagers

[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:48.460]
are snickering in delight they're snickering in delight that the smarmy synonym for the effort in

[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.560]
the film starring Mike Myers is in there how dare the producers writes key hulphman in Fort

[00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:02.700]
Lauderdale the British synonym for the effort boy lethal pay the effort is in there how dare they

[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.580]
and then in the same paper by the way that's in the editorial page letter to the editor same

[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.200]
newspaper as you turn over to the business section here's a big article with a headline it says

[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.460]
shagvertizing in areas again Austin Powers this by who shamelessly plugs and it goes on about here's

[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.940]
a picture of with his milk mustache ad campaign oh I heard mommy had a milk mustache too one time

[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:31.660]
and then here over here is uh first USA visa and there's the a virgin Atlantic and all over the

[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.660]
goddamn place every day everybody look there's uh Mike Myers there's this Austin Powers thing

[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.820]
and uh all over the place don't ask me why I mean far be it for me to give my opinion about that

[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.020]
because you know me I'm an old buddy that he and I don't want to pee on everybody else's parade

[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.960]
that he's so goddamn funny is he funny oh nice you know

[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.520]
exactly a little bit goes along yeah yeah I mean it's the same thing over and over and over and over

[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.000]
and over again okay I mean it's the same with that same look and the same bad a phony bad teeth

[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.620]
no seriously that's what they did to make him look British they made the phony real bad teeth

[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.180]
because if you're British you have to have rotten teeth and it goes with the territory only the

[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.060]
royal family are permitted to have what appeared to be real teeth and who knows if they are for real

[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.100]
or not probably not they probably can't but something about the British maybe they're reading

[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.840]
like too much spotted dick oh probably a tea health man in Fort Lauderdale be writing a letter

[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.260]
to the editor Marbottes the fact that even on the talk shows now they're using British terms

[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.220]
like spotted dick well if it's good enough for the British to say why can't we say it it's kind

[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.200]
of like mama la penga if it's good enough for the Cubans to say and all the other do the Mexicans

[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.900]
say that oh no they just do it no seriously is that like a term that uh is indigenous to denotts

[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:49.600]
all the uh all the Julio's do that trust me so here again somebody very upset the word police

[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.820]
let's get those guys from Michigan what was the place standish standish Michigan let's get

[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.180]
those they're a little off a standish get them down here and see if they can't do something about

[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:05.440]
this guy damn Austin Powers guy and shag galantic the spy who shagged me you know I think it's a good

[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.600]
sign I think it's great I mean maybe just a little tiny bit we're growing up you know first it

[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.120]
was Monica with uh Bubba and blow jobs we finally blew her to that out oh my god you can't say blow

[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:23.180]
jobs well everybody didn't there you go thank you Bubba oh I was watching on the news last night

[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:30.660]
the wooden man even even Ron Diaz wasn't as wooden as Al Gore he's a good guy but he's as wooden as

[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:39.560]
they come he needs a personality transplant and I was thinking oh and and also then right after

[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.720]
right after they showed that they had the spot with Bob Doolan you know where he's doing the

[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:51.320]
Olympian spot and I was thinking of myself if you don't like Clinton's politics at least we had a

[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.640]
president this time who could get it up there's something to be said for that uh yeah we didn't

[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.280]
elect somebody who's got a limp that's not good for the American psyche okay can you see a sitting

[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.480]
president can you see if Bob Dool had been elected and he's in there serving out his second term

[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:10.500]
and he goes on TV it says well I have a limp but Litty uh doesn't mind because I'm popping

[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.380]
these pills Litty and I don't think he's talking about Litty Dool I think he's talking about G Gordon

[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:19.260]
Litty I think he's doing it can you tell me where Litty comes from by the way have you ever known

[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:30.120]
any but an indelizabeth who's been called Litty what is that all about Liz Beth oh speaking

[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.200]
of Beth by the way the guiding light now you'd like her even though she's a little old make-up makes

[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:40.020]
her look a lot younger definitely would like her she's now I would say the best female on that show

[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.620]
by a long shot Beth even though I can't stand the character she plays and her acting is like so

[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.920]
overdone 20 years for overacting sweetheart with a hand like everything but oh but uh Lizzy uh

[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.680]
well with a hand but anyway see I'm just rambling with them gonna kill some good time and I'll

[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.900]
pull the side the audience will let us know whether they we should give those passes away the

[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.560]
tarzana now is that what they're for tarzana movie maybe if we play tarzana and jane by toybox

[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:09.840]
in the background you would like uh do we have that here no anyway it's 1009 at 560 wqa m

[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:18.280]
thank you milk my jockey shorts and now thoughts do something today you've never tried before

[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:24.280]
like really putting in a full day of work you'll appreciate how much you get away with

[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:31.760]
once someone hurts you forgive them and move on unless you have a clear shot at punching them in the head

[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:37.760]
if there are no dwarfs in a circus does that mean there's a shortage of little people

[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:45.980]
how come you have to eat milk chocolate the drink chocolate milk take a few moments each day to

[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:53.800]
look back on your life and reflect why was that stupid look at yourself in the mirror and if you

[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:59.380]
think you look hot you are and if the man you're interested in won't give you the time of day

[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.000]
he's just gay if you think everybody is out to get you they are plant just one seed and it will

[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.880]
reveal a gift of nature that can be admired or stomped into the ground depending on your move that day

[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:19.700]
if you can't say anything nice about somebody make up something about their sexual preference

[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.300]
it's almost time to get jiggy with it

[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.440]
if I ever see him again it'll be much much too soon you know what I am trying to think of the people

[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.640]
who just get make me gag the most and they're several on the list like god direct for example

[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.440]
but we'll Smith I mean what was the story with him can he sing no can he and no is he like a

[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:48.360]
pleasant no he just makes me sick god oh there you go with that racist thing I don't care if he

[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.620]
woke up tomorrow morning his white is the fallen snow okay it don't have be having nothing to do

[00:10:52.620 --> 00:11:00.500]
with that he just I find is offensive I just wrote test and just oh man not as offensive is Ricky

[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.700]
Martin but pretty close speaking of offensive by the way somebody faxes us 60 something year old

[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.660]
Jim Brown hey Jim Brown for all you jocks nippers out there great number 32 Cleveland Brown one of the

[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:15.920]
greatest running backs all those number 32s a arrested last night on felony charges for threatening

[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.780]
kill his 24 year old wife but he was white too by the way and he's another guy that likes white

[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.200]
chicks which is see there's nothing wrong with that generally speaking but there's something about

[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.940]
these athletes that there's certain ones again not to mention any names but they're very big

[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:36.560]
with white chicks what is that all about maybe somebody can verify that for us with the Jim Brown's

[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:42.000]
wife is whatever she might be so let's find out from the audience but let's you know because I

[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:48.060]
said Thursday it's a horrendous day I can just feel that you can smell it I can already anticipate

[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.520]
it but now we could play the easy way out and give away those goddamn parses and passes since we

[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.620]
have about 50 million of them but that would be a cop out so let's find out from the audience whether

[00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.020]
they want us to do that or not because they will kill the show that much I guarantee you right now

[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:05.560]
there is no question whatsoever there were two things last year that were killers on this radio show

[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.800]
from like the middle of the summer until we stopped doing the giveaways in August to September and

[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.840]
that was the giveaways and number one even more than that was talking about that whammy show all

[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.020]
the time which nobody in listening audience wanted to see there were some people who watched it

[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.380]
about ten of them but those people weren't people who listened to the radio show because they had a

[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.400]
life or worked during the daytime so they turned it out at night to see just how ugly I was etc and

[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.980]
which smatha I was wearing that night and what a hypocrite I was because it was a religious thing

[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.280]
are you following what I'm saying so far no but those were two detrimental things so let's fight

[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.080]
out from these people should we give away and I'm not giving them away right now okay don't call

[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.140]
it say well I'll take some because we do have thirty six of them and each one is for good for two

[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:49.420]
people I let me ask you something this tarzan I'm a little bit confused didn't we just have a tarzan

[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:55.920]
with what's his name I can't think of the guy's name he's always on MTV for whatever reason you know

[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:04.060]
the guy I'm talking about you don't know the guy I'm talking about no on MTV he's always not a singer

[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.800]
but he's always on it for whatever reason he's like not a bad looking guy he's like I can't

[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.240]
think of what his name is he's definitely not on the list of the top 50 actors we did just have

[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.800]
a a tarzan though he did it was like a bomb this is the the cartoon the Disney thing oh this is a

[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.880]
I don't think we're gonna do it I'm very reversed to doing I know what they're gonna say what

[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:49.520]
no no I'm not I don't hear a dial tone so goddamn fast we're not giving anything away we're

[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:54.280]
doing a four play now to find out whether we should give stuff away to me that's the worst

[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.960]
thing you can do on a radio show I want to apologize to everybody in this town for going through that

[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.500]
period of time even those porn movies would give away even though it didn't reach many lives

[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.240]
out there in radio land I should say those adult videos you that's supposed to say porn movies

[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.320]
because then it sounds obscene and filthy which in America everything's obscene and filthy even

[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.160]
though everybody wants to see it and especially some of us want to do it but nevertheless

[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.880]
we'll find out come on let's go let's find out from this crowd out there you bunch of dead heads

[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.400]
just like I did that thing yesterday about manager Joe Rose and like you know three people I had

[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.540]
a force feed to have an opinion on it these people don't even have an opinion anything and you

[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.420]
want to know why they're not con because they're there were sitting back waiting thinking that I

[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.260]
will give them out and then they're gonna call right away and grab them and please stop calling

[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:40.920]
about Casper van being who is who who's the tarzan in the latest tarzan movie with Jane March which

[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:46.220]
was a very big bomb yeah he was the guy from Starship Troopers but the one in the face that wasn't

[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:50.500]
the tarzan movie no I know that movie was George of the jungle but they're so in the other way a

[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:54.580]
cartoon made a movie for the day when you made it from the god damn rope and he was running around

[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:59.100]
with a god damn leopard skin outfit on the same old crap you know yeah but he runs into things and

[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:09.500]
then he started doing the monkey WQ I am look at that these people are you're pathetic you really

[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:15.360]
are here's Kendall hello hey Neil how you doing okay sir listen I'm calling because I respect

[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:22.680]
your opinion and I like what you have to send the past about diabetes I have diabetes and

[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:29.700]
my doctor just prescribed Resolent have you heard anything about that not really no no

[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.940]
because there was stuff on the news they're pulling it from the mark I heard some negative things

[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:40.460]
about it yeah and I just spoke to the doctor prescribed it to me yeah and he's telling me that

[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:45.580]
it's all a bunch of false advertising all about but listen seriously instead of calling me why

[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:50.500]
does you go second opinion call another doctor I just I just want to call you and see what if you

[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.440]
had no but that's my advice is to get a second opinion from another doctor I'm I don't give

[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.260]
people life you know I mean that's when you have diabetes it's like life and death yeah

[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:06.220]
get another opinion all right okay good luck hello doctor I mean I don't want you know I'm

[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.600]
not belittling the guy because diabetes is a serious illness and you got to have it under

[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.100]
control because you go blind you lose your limbs and you know you start going little bit like that

[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:18.540]
but nevertheless find a real doctor out there and when you find one by the way let me know who it is

[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:26.160]
here's Miami hello hello Neil there's no interest in these passes by the way yes sir no giveaways please

freeloaders. Now let's talk about Ruth Chris again, how come they answer? Hey listen

[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.620]
though if you look if you're gonna spend first then you deserve like maybe a

[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.460]
little something you know a little demi-pass like I said.

[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:31.560]
WQAM? QAM? Ticket line? WQAM, hello. Yeah, how you doing? Great. Is this

[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:37.180]
meal? Speaking. All right, feel me. I got you in the first ring. Anyways I want

[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:42.720]
you to give it away and the tickets to Tarzan also. Yeah why? All right I don't

[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.180]
know. Sounds like a... You didn't want to yourself though did you? I mean it's a

[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.800]
stupid cartoon. You wouldn't go to a cartoon with you? Of course. You would go to

[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.880]
a cartoon? I live in Miami. You got to be a matured. Oh that's a good point. Okay well I'll

[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.400]
think about it. Thank you sir. Okay there's one who says give him away and he'll be

[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.420]
calling back in hurry if I say we'll give him away. Hey listen we can kill about

[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.500]
two hours doing this. Hey there's a method to my madness. I'll tell you that right

[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:09.180]
now. Okay I continue to talk about a bunch of boring sports crap and start

[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:13.740]
calling people names on a morning show like carpet muncher. We have that

[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:19.120]
here and pillowbiter. Oh yeah let's hear that. How long is it by the way? 16 seconds. Oh yeah let's hear it.

[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.300]
I'm 10 o'clock little pickle buffer. Why doesn't he take the call when he's

[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:27.860]
lifting out Joe like he is? All he wants is his little pillowbite is the call and

[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.000]
stick up on his side. He's a jerk. Joe you're absolutely right for

[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.480]
arguing because you're gonna work with those two guys. I don't know how you're

[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.860]
saying. Oh I mean that I take that as a high compliment a guy who sounds like

[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:44.600]
that. He's sucking up on Joe's side. Hey if that's the best you got on your side Joe

[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:50.680]
guess what you're in deep do do baby. You got a real serious tourist. And you know

[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.420]
something we just took a poll in the station there wasn't one person here that

[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:57.140]
came down on Joe's side even to people that hate death like poison all 40 of

[00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:03.980]
them they said you know what kind of crap is that. But again another one

[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.500]
of the suckling sound like a real New Yorker with a same setting all sound the

[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.100]
same they all you know smell the same. Go back on a subway okay get out of

[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.500]
our lives. See I thought it was like maybe like a almost normal person that's a

[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.540]
high compliment to me. With something that's that much of an obvious scumbag with a

[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:25.260]
phony voice. Yeah you're cooper mature with the new one. But fuck it yeah. Pack this

[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.600]
okay you jackass. In fact just pack a small bag and get on the bus. That would be a

[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.880]
big favor to all of us. In fact maybe Joe could take you okay. Maybe the two of

[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:38.340]
you could like head north together or maybe do east would be good. That was great

[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.880]
1027 at 560 WQN if you talk dirty to me.

[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:15.640]
Alright 132 at 560 WQN we got thank Goldberg sure to a clock we got Josh Darrow at

[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.260]
6 o'clock tonight. How do you like that? All clarences on you like that. Yeah come on

[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.720]
he'll be great. He'll be great. It'll sound like over the age of 10. He's on from

[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.880]
6 to 8. It's filled a couple hours in here because we got nobody else. And then we got

[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.380]
the NHL game number five Stanley Cup championship they call it this year. We used to call it

[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.440]
the finals but that didn't sound like it's impressive enough. So Gary Beckman decided

[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:40.080]
well it's the Stanley Cup championship. Okay whatever you say a little tour eight o'clock

[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.820]
tonight Buffalo will beat Dallas. Oh man that would be great wouldn't that be something

[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.180]
if they beat him tonight. Well you love that. Give me sexual excitement. So anyway I you

[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:51.180]
know getting back to the carpet munching guy or whatever that guy was talking about the

[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:56.020]
pickle puffers. Let me just say this to you I would ordinarily dignify a jackass obnoxious

[00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:00.320]
New York stereo typical scumbag loud mop like you but let me just say this as far as the

[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:04.580]
Joe Rose thing which I don't want to dwell on but I will anyway. See one of the things

[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.660]
that I find them especially a guy used to be a football player you know big jock macho

[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:13.580]
the whole deal. You can't be a pussy no matter what business you're in you have to take

[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.580]
responsibility for your own success or failure you can't always be looking to blame somebody

[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:21.840]
else you know. So if you have a crappy trend or a crappy rating book or whatever it is don't

[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.700]
be looking to blame the program director or the sales manager or everybody else or the

[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.400]
general manager which you wouldn't do because you don't have the balls to rip him on here

[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:34.120]
but nevertheless don't be looking to blame somebody else look in the mirror it'd be very

[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.340]
easy to say well we don't have any promotion on this body and our something we don't have

[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.020]
any promotion and we still just had the biggest guy named reading book in a history of WQIM

[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.720]
in a modern history of it anyway. Since way back in the days when there was only two stations

[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:52.400]
on the air and they still couldn't make 50% so how is that possible? I just I'm just not

[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.040]
too big on guys that are always looking for scapegoats blaming somebody else. I mean if

[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.560]
I'm on the air and like you know get a lot of crappy calls in the idiots and how can I blame

[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:07.020]
the people on the other side of the glass are they responsible for that? No. We got a whole

[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:10.940]
bunch of people in this radio station who have turned into emotional cripples lately I don't

[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.900]
know what that's all about. If you're having a crappy day you know what crap happens that's

[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:19.460]
the way it is just the way it works but don't be looking to point the thing with all the

[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:24.700]
underlings oh you're too full yeah how is it there fault are they making the calls? No.

[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:30.560]
Are they set up deals? No. So that's my best advice okay is that some of the people

[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.680]
are building need to grow up and take responsibility for their own success or failure. You're going

[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.400]
to take credit for the success don't be pointing the finger at everybody else blaming them when

[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.840]
you suck big time okay. I'm not blaming anybody else for those shows where I was given

[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:48.460]
stuff away those shows sucked. I apologize I'm embarrassed by those shows those shows were

[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.280]
worse than back in the days when I was doing those boring guests on WS News 100 years ago

[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.140]
and an I and Z at night hello that's that those shows I'm embarrassed by I apologize for

[00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.820]
those I don't blame anybody else nobody how the gun to my head and say you got to put this

[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:05.420]
old fart on the air and talk to a bunch of 90 year old geriatric idiots who want to hear

[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:10.240]
some free medical advice and you know find out how to squeeze their bag the right way nobody

[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:16.760]
told me to do that I take responsibility takes a real man like yours truly to take responsibility

[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.980]
for your own or whatever you're going to say hey look we just had a great book fine then

[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.280]
when you have a crappy book don't look to blame anybody else Joe and others in this building

[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.180]
don't be pointing the finger at all the underlifts blame them when you're young doing a really

[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:35.080]
crappy horrible show say I suck today I'd like to have some of these people on this station

[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:42.140]
get on here and say my show yesterday suck and I'm responsible for it huh now my show yesterday

[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:47.320]
happened to be pretty good on this on this you know although we've had plenty of shows on this station

[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:53.080]
that suck and I take some responsibility for it I think mostly it's George no seriously don't

[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:58.580]
be saying that other people when you suck if I suck it's because I want a suck okay but that's

[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:05.700]
another story for tomorrow show let's see people are saying a synonym for the f-word yeah here's

[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.500]
thank you I can't stand will Smith is there anybody in this audience who can stand will Smith no

[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:16.240]
no everybody I know hates him like poison do the black people like will Smith no white people

[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:22.640]
yellow people purple people no eaters now they hate him who are his crowd who they be I think it's

[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:28.540]
another medium myth I think it's a conspiracy nobody likes will Smith he's just obnoxious he just

[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:34.360]
got that arrogant hostile attitude like my stuff don't stink god is he make me nauseous how come

[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:40.420]
Freddie Prince is dead and he's still alive whatever that means but it's I think it's a great

[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:47.080]
point here's pop it ob shell oh hey how you doing great hey six pounds and five days on the

re-entertaining in a very sadistic way and of course I am sadistic I'm a real sadist I love I'm

[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.060]
you know it's when you live in South Florida long enough you become a very kind of close

[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:50.060]
student unfriendly and be you start becoming a sadist anyone who inflicts as much punishment on

everybody else so they can be as miserable as you are because you have to be here wow that was

[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:59.080]
great by the way sir the answer is the answer is no we haven't even decided yet whether we're

[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:03.020]
gonna give them away we're doing a little full play here okay and don't throw you don't use

my little kid he's dying of some horrible disease we don't know what it is yet and we're not

[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:16.860]
really sure if he's got it but we think he might be dialed someday can we have the tickets no

[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:22.240]
what tickets we're not doing any tickets yet this is the four-player and so far the overwhelming

[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.240]
majority of people have said don't do that because if I do do it it's only because we want

[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:31.660]
persons a fault and that's George I mean mine no well he's pushing for it I don't know why you're

[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:36.780]

way start time with the audience going to see some stupid Tarzan cartoon what kind of a person

[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:59.840]
goes and see as a stars a star's a cartoon only somebody who goes because his woman you know

[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.940]

[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:08.000]
everybody around here a little bit out of control like I said everything was going just great

[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.180]
we were on an even keel everybody was happy we had great ratings and then all of a sudden we get

[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.880]
one bad print or somebody farce the wrong flavor and then everybody's all bent out of shape here

[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.380]

[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.660]
guys from millions of the Auld

[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:16.960]
and

[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:17.020]
i hear

[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.280]
a fact from boss in the last year told you we had another out of the time

[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.180]
line here we get fifty million calls every day from living in breathing people

[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.460]
but nevertheless the fact that he still works

[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.760]
from scott and boss didn't says i like hearing you not give stuff away when you

[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.700]
give free loaders a hard time and makes my day my vote would be free to tell people

[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.660]
you were given the tickets away but did not actually give them to anyone who

[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.880]
asked for

[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.480]
uh... always done that before i've uh... pulled out you know

[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.260]
especially when we actually work in something away but had to go through about

[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:43.780]
a hundred people

[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.600]
uh... i don't know that's a bad

[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.980]
it's that statistics to be again that makes i like hearing people travel

[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.420]
especially for something insignificant is movie tickets you know there's nobody

[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.340]
listening to me right now can't afford like ten bucks for a pair of movie

[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.780]
tickets is there anybody no

[00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:01.260]
i mean i realize that that she's a pretty expensive these days that grandma

[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.340]
boon but nevertheless

[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:06.160]
so thank you scott and boss didn't like that

[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.040]
five six seven oh five sixty i still haven't made up my definitive mind of

[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:10.520]
by the way

[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.740]
because i think the audience might enjoy hearing a lot of your people out there

[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.740]
gravel and uh... you know dehumanize yourself

[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.920]
i mean for ten for ten bucks worth of tickets these people do almost anything

[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.060]
they get out of their hands and knees and kiss my feet

[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:24.220]
oh sorry joe

[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.440]
here's a fact now where the hell is this this look all i see

[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.020]
panamocity that's what happened

[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.860]
a fourth grade student was reading a magazine when his teacher one the

[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.660]
Nelson granted the magazine that is

[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:40.120]
called it pornography ripped up the offending pages and threw them in a trash can

[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.820]
this was in panamocity only in america

[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:48.920]
only in prudish backwards america the magazine was national geographic

[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.760]
and the pornography was an article on evolution that included drawings

[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:58.060]
not pictures not photos drawings of naked humans

[00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:58.980]
wow

[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.380]
yes today the cherry street elementary school teacher received a written

[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.060]
reprimand for inappropriate action

[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.580]
but the school superintendent didn't believe that censorship was an issue

[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.820]
they county school superintendent Larry Bolinger said he supported the teachers

[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.780]
right to stop what she considered a disruption but said she crossed the line

[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:19.240]
when she damaged the magazine

[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.020]
in other words it's okay to keep the kids from looking at those drawings but don't

[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.720]
be thrown in the trash because probably the superintendent wants to see it

[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.260]
later on

[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.600]
Sebastian Allen ten had taken his older brother's magazine a rare collector's

[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.220]
issue to school after miss Nelson that incurred miss

[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:40.880]
miss Nelson I asked down here once before nobody responded to it because they

[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.760]
don't want to admit that most of their teachers were bull dikes

[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.840]
miss how can you be missed I mean your miss uh whatever she was she was like

[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.560]
65 years old she was miss I had to teach her miss lines she was like 120

[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.060]
years old she was still a miss

[00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:00.120]
there's something a miss here anyway he had taken the magazine to school after

[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.460]
miss Nelson and occurred students to bring reading material from home in case

[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:07.960]
they completed a state assessment test before time ran out so it brings in this

[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:13.280]
national geographic ten years old you think that ten year old are too young

[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.100]
to see drawings of naked people no I mean what are we talking about here boys

[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:21.280]
and girls ten years old is there any kid that too young to see pictures of

[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.740]
naked people because the message we want to send out of course is the human

[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:29.520]
body is dirty dirty dirty dirty the body forget about the sex part but I mean

[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:33.860]
just a body all by itself it's dirty especially if it's like a lot of hair

[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:37.120]
on it like an ape then it's really dirty when you know that hair collects a

[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:41.980]
lot of you know all kinds of stuff but at any rate so there you go Panama City

[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:44.980]
Florida where you'd expect to find that kind of crap going on by the way Panama

[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.960]
City bunch of uptight for reading the new people are talking about wow if we

[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.840]
forget casinos here yeah we're gonna get casinos here if you're asked we're

[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:57.080]
gonna get casinos because we got these places take a look at this state where

[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.840]
do you find a part of this state where there's like living and reading people

[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:04.900]
we have about what 500 of them here where else any of them in Tampa no we got four or

[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.240]
five over there and four Myers listening on our affiliate over there like I said

[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:13.540]
three or four Naples no got the bees leaves over there that you know it immediately

[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:20.900]
qualifies as subhuman Tampa oh no clear water no no Panama City no

[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:25.720]
Tallahassee no Jamesville say college students maybe especially if they're from

[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:30.120]
out of state there's a few but other than that the idea of living and

[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.340]
breathing in people people would IQ larger than their toenail in this state is so

[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:37.560]
ludicrous and we're gonna get casinos here we're gonna have like all these things

[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.060]
going on no we got we got license plates that say choose life and to take a

[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:46.060]
bullet for Christ we got those coming out but anything that makes sense that we

[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.540]
might be able to have a good time with okay all you spring breakers now Daytona's

[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.780]
had enough to get out of there push him up into Georgia push him up to God

[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:56.620]
them Savannah anywhere out of this state we don't want any living and

[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.200]
breathing people here we don't want to have a good time we want to make sure

[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:04.160]
that misery loves company and you're having it misery even even maybe we

[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:09.380]
ought to bring her here to be governor Kathy Bates she'd be a perfect governor

[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:13.100]
for the state of Florida she'd come over to your house and break your legs in her

[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:20.200]
spare time here's what is that boy beach or boi beach boy

[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:27.060]
beach where's that yes sir go ahead I say give the tickets away but only to

[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:31.980]
southern back this uh-huh I guess that leaves you out okay we're not giving away

[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.100]
no tickets unless we get a whole a runner people here who want them if you want

[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.080]
to be better call right now maybe I'll break down I doubt it but we never know

[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:45.860]
what well you're saying don't do it either I'm asking I asked you a question

[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:53.080]
not I don't answer the phone and just get addresses and stuff like that well

[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:57.440]
there's an honest answer see George never said that he broke his

[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:01.260]
Georgia's got a family to support he's like on a payroll but when you're not

[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.240]
making any money here I guess that's a real honest answer there right there

[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.320]
it's a pain in the ass taking all those names and I'll make him do it then he's

[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:13.720]
the one that's got all the address labels out five six seven oh five sixty

[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:18.940]
pound five sixty on the mobile one line it's great just great watching people

[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:23.840]
grow I want my daughter she so upset you have those tickets you're gonna share

[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.900]

[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:31.880]
some of that in the envelope with the tickets five six seven so you don't want

[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.040]
to bet enough to you now the one guy will give him credit he did ask it was

[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.940]
very humiliating embarrassing I'm sure a lot of people are calling him at home

[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:41.600]
right now or at the office just making all kinds of fun of them but it was worth it

[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:46.080]
for ten bucks worth a crappy ticket to some stupid cartoon movie and by the way

[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.180]
it's Disney which is why the guys have given to the Southern Baptist that was

[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:54.660]

[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.160]
behavior of some of our host here yesterday who were busy running around

[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.580]
screaming at everybody else you know we got some people here they can put on

[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.180]

board the single you know I mean it's a great song but enough already I mean

[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:43.320]
just enough there's other great songs that an album and that by the way was one

[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:48.000]
of the first forty five thousand times but now just give it a rest wow so anyway

[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.700]
my I'm sitting there getting my haircut and on the radio I must have been

[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:55.760]
Y 100 because it sounded like a real bunch of simple things on there and they

[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.080]
were talking about Donna summer when they have done a summer on Y 100 is she

[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.660]
got like a new hit or something she does I guess that's what they were playing

[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.540]
anyway they were talking about well isn't it great that she was never stalked

[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.500]
and she was never getting all that bad public and I'm thinking to myself who

[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.860]
the hell is really ever heard until her little comeback here she was my

[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:16.360]
barber said she was doing gospel records there for a while you know that's how

[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.240]
desperate she was because everybody was running around with the trendy thing to

[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.540]
say disco stuff even though everybody loved disco but everybody had a

[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:25.240]
while saying disco stuff because they figure if you said that you like

[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:30.340]
disco that made you a faggot and of course it did because like it seems like

[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.680]
everything else you want to know how to dress turn to the faggot's okay you want

[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.760]
to know about music turn to the faggot you want to know about show business movies

[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:43.300]
art all that turn to the faggot now some people would say well if you want to

[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.900]
know about music turn to the Schwarzenegger because everybody's rapping it all

[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.800]
the young white guys and they're talking like guys Schwarzenegger listen to their

[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:53.700]
music but see basically white people don't have anything you know heterosexual

[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.100]
white people have no culture they had nothing of their own they steal everything

[00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:01.740]
from somebody else that's an excellent point that I just made even I'm impressed by

[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:06.720]
it never really thought about that before other than maybe Elvis maybe that's why Elvis

[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:11.480]
is so high on that list because he's a who wasp he was a wasp he was a good old

[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:17.280]
country boy redneck who used to sleep with mommy till they were about 35 yeah what's

[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.000]
wrong with sleeping in the same bed with mommy till you're like 40 I don't you know

[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:26.580]
it's a little crowded but here's a mobile in top of no hello yeah how you doing today great you

[00:41:55.460 --> 00:42:00.320]
I got a great fact from my nourished you ever get a fact from a guy named Nuret before no no

[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:04.720]
who is in Israeli those Israelis you talk about the sparsas haven't strange names those

[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:11.080]
Israelis like Yitzhak didn't Sean say his brother's name was Yitzhak but that's in Hebrew we don't

[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:17.060]
do Hebrew like Nahman my name is Nahman it's got a good and oh there's another one mmm delicious

[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:24.740]
Nahman I love that choose it got strange names sparsas I got really funky names I like

[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:30.480]
Moisha I would say all the names in America my favorite is definitely Moisha what be your favorite name

[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:36.120]

[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:40.060]
kids they like speaking to the nigger thing hey nigan all this other but you don't see white people

[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:45.460]

[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.360]
why I'm so incoherent maybe it's because I have to go to mommy's for lunch today and a little

[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:18.600]
bit off my feet that might be it now I'm not like the guy the guy who goes and printing on other

from one of our listeners out there I can't divulge the source but it's a very credible source so

[00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:23.550]
the rumor is that and maybe that's why he went ballistic yesterday maybe he was looking to get

[00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:30.190]
canned but the rumor is that Joe Rose is leaving the morning show okay that's a rumor I

[00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:34.970]

[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.400]
for the fact that was a real crappy boring call but I'm not going to do that you know what I'm saying

[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:24.800]
carrying on and getting the phone slammed out of me by Bill Tanner which at least has saved me for

[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.780]
having to speak then again by the way because you do understand this is the Tanner building

there five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT see if the audience really understood

[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.420]
what I'm not half of the stuff I'm talking about then I'd really be doing great or maybe be in

[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:45.760]
big trouble where's the uh facts I was talking about my Israeli friends what don't I do with that

[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:51.280]
so much good crap here today man and a lot of bad stuff too most of the factions that commit oh

[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:56.840]
here it is it's right here on top or it was it says dear Neil I heard you for the first time about

[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:02.760]
12 years ago this is our Israeli friend by the way who starts out by going oh I heard you for the

[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:07.460]
first time about 12 years ago in visiting the states from Israel my father gave you a hearty

[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:13.140]
recommendation telling me you were astounding so I listened to this day I all I recall is Pope

[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:17.220]
madness the pope was on his way here and you were in a frenzy I must admit I was astounded

[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:23.460]
I'm astounding and he was astounded what do you expect I'm astounding you should be astounded

[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:27.800]
so much so that I took your show back with me to Israel and tried to pedal it and Hebrew format

[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.920]
look at this they're even trying to rip me off in Israel I do you like that

[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:39.700]
Israel needed a good political religion the bashing radio station so I nagged and nagged and failed

[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:43.040]
oh there's mark mostly standing in the doorway so it's always good there's a wonderful good

[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:48.820]
people from power 96 image go griffin are there any other ones no no anyway it says they looked at

[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:53.460]
me contemptuously and they said they had heard of you and don't want they don't want such as you

[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:57.160]
nothing personally we're just too kind of heard of we don't want his kind on the air over here

[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:02.440]
is what they were trying to say got so close is what they said and they call their radio station

[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:08.020]
the voice of peace ha he says with an exclamation point I love that don't you let's all have all the

[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:11.160]
things that you see like in comic books you know it's like power like a Batman you know

[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:16.960]
power bam things that nobody ever says or makes those sounds but nevertheless ha anybody you

[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:22.540]
know ever say ha no no only at the dentist anyway to make this story long story even longer I'm

[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:27.500]
back here in Miami it'll be three years since I've arrived here every fresh breeze in the sweltering

[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:34.260]
decaying city I enjoy listening to your acrid brutally honest with unfortunately I can't leave

[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:37.840]
Miami so don't you leave either always a matter of fact now that you mentioned that Joe Rosen

[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.040]
I believe in the duet we constantly hear all the bad and corrupt I merely wanted to praise you for

[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:46.700]
all the good and compacted perhaps hopeful triumph over his experiences Samuel Johnson said whatever

[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:52.100]
that means listless in Miami and I'd rather recall a listless in Miami than Nuret because Nuret

[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:57.340]
is like what kind of a name is that that's almost as bad as Moisha don't be picking on Moisha again

[00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:01.160]
we'll get that guy called again from Liberty City who was also iconic because he thought it was a racist

[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:04.440]
I don't care if you're like purple okay if your name is Moisha I can say it's

[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:11.140]
God changes eight minutes after 11 at 560 WQAM have we given any tickets away yet no I'm sure

[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:16.000]
thinking about it I got my thinking cap on I might just do it if somebody sucks real hard you know

[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.500]
if somebody gets me just in the right frame of mind mix up some cocka-mamae story I might give

[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:26.640]
away some of those tarzan to that great Disney carzan cartoon it's Disney so it must be great

[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:31.020]
and it's probably part of that homosexual agenda too by the way is this one more tarzan like

[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:34.300]
keeps dropping his one cloth on the ground I think that's the one

[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:37.660]
so it can't keep his packer in his pants

[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:10.500]
I think I can do drag city I go to the third world and path around the club on who be fired

[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:02.860]

[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:06.960]
my daughter's got a bad hang nail or something or I just broke my nails oh by the way hi to my good

[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:12.540]
friend Sylvia again oh I forgot the good news yesterday I left here and go through the turn

[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:16.460]
bike and here's my close personal friend Sylvia I said hey Sylvia I was talking about you today oh I

[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:19.700]
know I was listening and she gave me like a pad on the hand I said don't touch sweetheart I love you

[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:24.740]
saw Sylvia and then going home guess who I saw in my neighborhood yesterday will give me a big

[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:30.820]
friendly wave Rick the mail man oh right no it's funny because I saw him pulling out and the

[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:36.260]
mail truck too from the side street see how was that possible I don't get home at exactly the same

[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:41.300]
time every day and yet Rick the mail man is always pulling out from one of those side streets just

[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:46.000]
at the moment that I'm driving up to my house I don't understand that he must like sit off the edge

[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.340]
of the road they're waiting you know looking down the street to see what I'm coming and then pull

[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:52.800]
out there you know so we can like flip me off or whatever but yesterday they gave me a big wave

[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:56.400]
and I was like chuckling as soon as I saw the mail truck pull out because I thought to myself well

[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:02.360]
now is the moment of truth he almost turned it off but he couldn't get his hand quite on at

[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:06.400]
knob soon enough so where he's still listening I scroll and Rick you're high book just don't shine

[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:11.760]
me again I mean I usually don't give a crap on anybody thinks but there are a few exceptions and

[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:16.320]
Rick the mail man he's one when he starts when I'm when he turns his back on me then I know I'm

[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:20.200]
finished and I can't blame it on anybody else like certain other people on the station are always

[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:25.840]
blaming everybody else for their crappy shows five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the

[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:30.920]
AT&T wireless line no seriously I know it's not personally there it's business not personal like

[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:35.020]
headcaplin I love that capillaries a great guy but I happen to be in the car last night and I'm

[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:41.100]
going to tell you something oh have you ever oh please I realized there's an emergency they had

[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:44.880]
nobody to fill there until a moral game which didn't start so much later on last night but oh

[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:51.120]
I mean a shameless not just a gambling show I want to retract what I've said before I joke about

[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:55.360]
being the headcaplin gambling show and it like and I think I'm joking about I'm not it's not a joke

[00:57:56.280 --> 00:58:00.580]
I wish I had the calls from that show the first three or four calls I mean right out of the box

[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:07.920]
hey that's San Jose State Sacramento game that volleyball game what do you what do you think the

[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:13.840]
over I got the under on the angels they they could put like a hidden mic at mugsy Solomon's

[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:19.440]
bookie joint and it would be basically the same as the headcaplin show how could we possibly have

[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.860]
that on there before ten o'clock I think the FCC should pass a law that had caplin even though he's

[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:28.500]
a great guy and we love him he should not be allowed on here before ten o'clock at night because

[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.280]
at least anybody who's listening after ten o'clock at night it's okay to have the GA crowd because

[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:35.780]
anybody else has got a real life they're not listening to the radio after ten o'clock at night are they

[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:44.720]
no no way Jose I mean that this was just uh exactly I'm speechless about it yeah

[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:20.640]
I mean everybody's got different taste but to me this is a great cigar oh they got great cigars

[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:25.680]
down I call away them from sunrise to go down the one I'm down in that area all right I go down

[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:40.680]
for a Nick now with that girl did out there as she took a bullet for Nick that for Christ sake for Nick

[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:46.700]
5 6 7 0 5 60 Palm 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line and nobody letting your little 10-year-old kids

[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:51.140]
say no to the National Geographic with drawings of naked and by the way what kind of National Geographic

[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:55.980]
only has drawings of naked people in it huh I thought that's the only reason that people bought

[00:59:55.980 --> 01:00:00.020]
National Geographic was for the pictures of naked people in it they didn't have many pictures of

[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:06.980]
cavemen what does that mean that's what the drawings were of I don't know you're missing my point

[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:10.720]
you don't understand what I'm saying in other words if those were offensive what about the other

[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:17.300]
pictures you'd expect to find in a National Geographic about all those naked yeah you bangies

[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:23.960]
what hey listen I mean it's a genetic thing people can't help it if they have thick lips unless

[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.480]
of course they're doing something to intentionally stretch them now that's an interesting point

[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:32.960]
and there's a lot of guys out there who would appreciate a nice young lady with very thick lips

[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:39.900]
huh now I'm sure they will I mean when you say don't give me no lip I mean don't say that so fast

[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:45.620]
before you think about the implications man don't lip off to me oh gee as soon as said that again

[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:50.620]
do you know what I said I said lip off don't say that should I say that again no I'll be saying that

[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:54.860]
woo we'll be we'll be back to square one all over it but but but but but we want the page stop it

[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:59.500]
yeah just calm down just calm down and grow up that's my advice for some of the people in this

[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:06.960]
town calm down and grow up not necessarily in that order now what they do those African tribes they

[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.820]
have those lips or they put those like some people have a bone in their nose they put like a

[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:17.840]
bone in their lip anybody ever have a bone in their lip well put it any right no and then they

[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:21.160]
they have all those things what do they put in there and then they do this and yeah they they

[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:27.960]
stretch it way out oh they put a block of wood in there why what is that is it considered

[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:35.800]
lovely oh it's good oh look at that you're beautiful man wow yeah that's the most beautiful

[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:42.680]
long lip I ever seen in my life five six seven oh five sixty so now maybe there's I don't know I see

[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.900]
that I don't want this is a sensitive issue okay I don't want to start getting called all kinds of

[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:51.700]
names again but you do notice that in America there are many black people not not the the islands

[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:57.380]
people also have that are just the African Americans do like Jamaicans do Jamaicans have like a

[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:05.780]
little loose lip yeah what's good to hide your weed in there I guess huh oh yeah when you've got

[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:09.140]
just don't want to swallow any seeds because then they come out back don't say may they go in just

[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:14.420]
like corn but at any rate no seriously it's a it's an interesting thing there and of course it's

[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:18.460]
much too sensitive to have an intelligent mature conversation about that about thick and there

[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:22.640]
are there many black people for example now come on guiding on yeah young in the horny he don't

[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.420]
have those big thick you bang he lips doesn't know of course he's like white I think really he just

[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:33.040]
has a suntan but the thick lips I think that's like an African thing let's find out about the

[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:40.180]
Haitians and Jamaicans have thick lips excellent topic here's the crawlgables hello Neil yes sir

[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:45.220]

[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.620]
they're even they're even talking about converting to Islam so in other words all of that's okay

[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:10.160]
as long as they don't move into their neighborhood is that what they're basically saying yeah basically

[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:16.000]
they're they're the middle class want to be black people they're white people who want to be black

[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:20.460]
right maybe maybe maybe we could have like national switch day when all the all the white people

[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.640]
who want to be black and all the black people who want to be white like all of a sudden wake up

online six give the guy online six and tickets okay we already got the mailing labels made

[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.220]
on you can handle it okay just don't put an e on interview lives in pompadol oh that's

[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:19.000]
right he's in Miami you should be able to handle it Miami five six hey listen again

[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.840]
so they don't teach stuff like pompadol and I don't blame them okay five six seven oh five

[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:26.400]
sixty eight five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:26.400]

[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:31.820]
look at this we've already killed an hour and a half for this and we finally gave away two tickets

[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:35.440]
see it now at this ratio by about the middle of the next week when now this these

[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:42.320]
tickets are good for when George they're good for when Friday uh through the engagement

[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:49.000]
to who's engagement the movie's engagement which is what what does that mean for as long as it's

[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.280]
in other words for as long as it's in there but based on what I hear you better go see it quick

[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:57.080]
now it'll probably be around a long time it's a Disney movie and of course those Disney movies don't

[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:04.140]
we love Disney yeah we love Disney just because he pisses off the Baptist let's go to a Miramar hello

[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:14.040]
mobile in Miramar 17 and a half minutes they're still on there and they're not responding how do you

[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:22.940]
what is it hello yes sir yes okay you gave those tickets where already yeah yeah I don't want the tickets

[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:28.200]
man I just had to suggest I wonder if it's illegal for you to give those tickets to work for your

[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:34.240]
guys over there publics or the lady in the told Plaza or maybe your mailman Rick the mailman I bet

[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:37.900]
you'd like to take one of his kids course I think his kids are probably like 25 but nevertheless

[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:44.340]
anyway that's a good idea take it give them the people who are nice you know there you go yeah

[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:48.420]
you know that's right because these people we talked to on the phone there are none of us we know who

[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:54.700]
they are they might be assholes for all we know you know am I right well hey goodby which is

[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:59.980]
oh anyway the main reason why I was calling I've been out of time for quite a bit and I was calling

[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:04.360]
regarding this rumor you were talking about a couple months ago you mean what about your

[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:13.560]
Rose leaving the morning show yeah I'm a big dog fan I was wondering about the Bolton Kaufman

if he's he doing a rise you coming to Miami or what yeah he's coming to Miami he and

[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:23.200]

[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:44.800]
Jimmy whatever he wants where we going by the way you read that thing a few weeks ago about how Jimmy

[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.540]
has never said to his lovely a girlfriend or fiance whatever you call her he never has said I love

[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:53.060]
you I mean that's between them but why would you tell a reporter I've met just to be a hard

[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:57.760]
ass is that it in other words just lie down in the spread your legs in the let's do it and then

[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.700]
let's get back to a diagram and football plays you know I mean what what what is that what kind of

[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:06.520]
a picture is that that somebody wants to make of themselves then he never told his which he's

[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.920]
engaged or something they're gonna get married but he never told her he loves her maybe he doesn't

[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.800]
love her you know maybe he doesn't love maybe can't stand her other than he likes to get laid

[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:17.720]

[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:24.560]

[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:51.680]
those prodomo reserves were my favorite until yesterday now I love those but when I find a cigar

[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:56.200]
that I like even better you know it's got to be pretty damn good the Cuban bullet I put one of those

[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.420]
in my put you know something I think I'm walking into mommy's house today she's always bitching

[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:03.840]
to me about smoke which I don't smoke a lot of cigars anymore one here we know and then bitching

[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:07.820]
and bitching it if it's not that it's something else I should walk in there smoking this doggy with

[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:12.480]
and start blowing smoke around they're in lunchtime yeah just to put her in her place and straighten

[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:18.400]

[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.060]
all the other great cigars they got the dos rios la tradition san Jose those in men'sos for those

[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:27.580]
who like to pretend it got something big at least it's in your mouth will you fudge back in perhaps

[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:34.520]
one of the most interesting words in the english language today is the word out of all of the

[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:40.500]
english words that begin with a letter f is the only word that is referred to as the f word

[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:48.220]
it's the one magical word just by its sound can describe pain pleasure hate and love

[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:54.880]
f*** as most words in the english language is derived from germans the word flikin which means

[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:02.740]
to strike in english f*** falls into many grammatical categories as a transitive verb for instance

[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:10.240]
john f*** surely its meaning is not always sexual it can be used as an adjective such as john's doing

[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:19.040]
all the f***ing work as part of an adverb surely talks too f***ing much as an adverb enhancing an

[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:28.380]
adjective surely is f***ing beautiful as a noun I don't give a f*** as part of a word abso f***

[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:36.960]
unludely or inf***ing credible and as almost every word in a sentence f*** the f***ing f***ers

[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:43.440]
this you must realize there aren't too many words with a versatility of f*** as in these examples

[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:51.840]
describing situations such as fraud I got f***ed that they use carlot this may all f*** it

[01:15:52.400 --> 01:16:00.380]
trouble I guess I'm really f***ed now aggression don't f*** with me buddy dismissal

[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:07.060]
why don't you go outside and play hide and go f*** yourself I'm sure you can think of many more

[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:15.460]
examples say it loudly and proudly f*** you all right okay it's eleven forty five at five sixty

[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:18.880]

[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:03.840]
noticed the diminishing response now several people dropped off because they've lost their

[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:08.880]
respect for me because I didn't stand by my guns I shouldn't have given a guy I don't know what

[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:12.320]
it is why did I give that guy the ticket it was you just struck me during a moment of weakness

[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:33.800]
of indicated this is from a few days ago I'm sure you saw this speaking of the wicked weed speaking

[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:39.580]
of that evil weed that's illegal you know I said the other day I'll say it again I think that the

[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:44.240]
the thing up there in standard Michigan where the guy he's going to be sentenced in about a week

[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.540]
but he stands to go to jail for 90 days and get a hundred dollar fine for public cursing

[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:53.680]
which is the same first defense for marijuana possession I think I think it's appropriate I think

[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:59.140]
it's just it's perfect the idea that for things as ludicrous as public cursing and smoking a little

[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:03.460]
weed that they have any penalty at all so I think it's a great parallel there it shows you the

[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:08.420]
mentality of people that make laws like that the fact that we live in a country we're smoking marijuana

[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:11.920]
where we have to have all these things and you have to show that you're doing it for medical purposes

[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:15.900]
of course because you're implemented and even people who aren't tremendous pain and are dying

[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:22.340]
over there even they can't get it in a lot of states how do you like that however the Florida

[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:27.400]
Supreme Court said they decided not to hear a case involving a 61 year old man who smokes marijuana

[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:31.880]
to keep his glaucoma at bay which means that six people in Florida can continue to argue in court

[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:36.120]
that their marijuana use is medically necessary how do you like that so you got to make up a good story

[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:41.080]
you got to put a patch over your eye or something like that or go in there drooling when you go to court

[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:46.300]
like that drooling and say oh I'm gonna have my pot or else I'm gonna like be drooling all over the

[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:50.540]
place and like some kind of a babbling idiot okay here you go in fact here's some good addresses for

[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:47.340]
she pulled up her dress and she showed them her rubble and leases and white fluffy duck

[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:55.200]

[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:18.200]
home in the country with a big fence out front if he has her phone lightly she'd show him her

[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:26.660]

[01:32:52.530 --> 01:32:55.910]
fact that his madness I don't know what it is but there's a method there's somewhere well I agree

[01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:59.430]
we have three two for the Buffalo and I think Peckle will score two I think he's the best player on

their team shitan and uh shitan is great you know I'm gonna tell you shitan is if there's such a thing

[01:33:05.010 --> 01:33:09.270]

[01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:14.230]
he takes he's great shitan is tremendous yeah didn't I tell everybody all season long there's one

[01:33:14.230 --> 01:33:19.550]

[01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:34.010]
up whenever he feels like it hey fast yes he is crazy fast hey nil did you catch that on cbc

[01:33:34.010 --> 01:33:38.890]
about the game I think it was for the good of the game where all the managers are talking about

[01:33:38.890 --> 01:33:44.590]
changing the rules yeah yeah where did that into crease rule get rid of it that's exactly right

[01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:48.910]
rid of it I guess what they're gonna do now they're gonna say they're still gonna do it you know

[01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:53.110]
with the replay but then the uh referee is gonna decide whether or not the uh guy in the crease had

[01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:57.230]
any effect impact on the goal which is stupid just get rid of it okay just get it out of there

[01:33:57.230 --> 01:34:01.510]
if there's a man in the free if there's goal interference fine and uh the waves of all off but

[01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:05.970]
otherwise they'll cut the crap how do they get away with the police not yes how do they get away

[01:34:05.970 --> 01:34:10.130]
with talking the did you hear some of the words coming out of their mouth there at that meeting no

[01:34:10.130 --> 01:34:15.830]
they were they were they said the sh word be me on cbc yep on that cbc they can say that I have a word

[01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:20.130]

[01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:28.870]
find them first then we'll give them to you and then you can give them to them is not kind of a

[01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:32.650]
roundabout way to do it uh five six seven let's find some other privilege kids to give them some

[01:34:32.650 --> 01:34:38.030]
tickets for the movie how do you like that so we do that no forget it the hell were the underprivileged

[01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:43.790]

[01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:49.030]

[01:35:51.570 --> 01:35:55.490]

[01:35:55.490 --> 01:36:00.430]
score it score it or the way smile on his push while our horse is dumb oh god I can't be

[01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:04.710]
getting to tell you how dumb horses are the only animal I think in the world that you can train to

[01:36:04.710 --> 01:36:11.630]
pee did you I've told you that before it's true when I had my race horses in Detroit I'm standing

[01:36:11.630 --> 01:36:17.010]
there in the barn in the train as well like that they whistle and a horse peas on command of course

[01:36:17.010 --> 01:36:21.290]
I'll do that too if there's like ice in the urinal ten minutes after noon and it's fresh ten minutes

[01:36:21.290 --> 01:36:25.030]
past noon with five now let me find this out before we go to shulas we better find out if there's

[01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:28.410]
ice in the urinal because if there's no ice in the urinal am I going no oh away

[01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:29.790]
oh

[01:37:00.190 --> 01:37:03.870]
yes

[01:37:03.870 --> 01:37:06.450]
a

[01:37:06.450 --> 01:37:13.270]
place. It's film

[01:37:43.690 --> 01:37:46.830]
If anybody has yet to come in, that's 21-year-old chick that he got on a plane in

[01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:47.110]
Chicago.

[01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:48.290]
Did we tell you about that?

[01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:49.610]
I'd better tell you again.

[01:37:50.850 --> 01:37:54.210]
Boy, you know, it's not like a little extra bonus when it comes in here with the free

[01:37:54.210 --> 01:37:55.710]
food we get to your all these sizzling stories.

[01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:57.770]
Anyway, speaking of that, a onafile.

[01:37:58.230 --> 01:37:59.730]
Thank you, David, and broken, by the way.

[01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:02.030]
Am I pronouncing that right?

[01:38:02.230 --> 01:38:04.370]
I get real nervous about mispronouncing words.

[01:38:04.890 --> 01:38:08.690]
An onafile is a person who loves wines, just like a pedophile is a person who loves children.

[01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:15.270]
Comes from the Greek word, oinus, oinus, meaning wine.

[01:38:17.210 --> 01:38:20.330]
And it says, thank God for the unit in real audio because I can't get AM radio otherwise

[01:38:20.330 --> 01:38:20.810]
in the office.

[01:38:21.050 --> 01:38:23.230]
I mean, see, that's one of the great things about being on an AM.

[01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:26.390]
And that's why most of our calls are on mobiles, by the way, because nobody inside of a

[01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:28.170]
building, anyone here, this goddamn radio station.

[01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:35.870]
Okay, thank you, David, so it means, comes from the Greek word, oinus, meaning wine.

[01:38:36.230 --> 01:38:37.170]
And be sure and try the wine.

[01:38:37.170 --> 01:38:39.130]
Nice go to Henry, he's doing it.

[01:38:39.970 --> 01:38:40.610]
Nice game.

[01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:43.070]
Just like that cigar Dave, that asshole.

[01:38:43.210 --> 01:38:44.670]
Boy, he really is too, you know?

[01:38:44.970 --> 01:38:46.350]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 65.

[01:38:46.690 --> 01:38:49.470]
We were talking to our good friends down there with Nick's last year, but we went down

[01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:50.070]
there the first time.

[01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:54.370]
Talking about Dave Zeppelwitz or whatever his name is cigar Dave.

[01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:56.090]
And Nick said, oh, yeah, I know him.

[01:38:56.250 --> 01:38:56.870]
He's an asshole.

[01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.230]
Yeah.

[01:38:57.450 --> 01:38:58.730]
And then Mike said, oh, yeah.

[01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:59.510]
He's an asshole.

[01:38:59.710 --> 01:39:01.610]
And then the old Nick yelled out from the other room.

[01:39:01.690 --> 01:39:02.330]
He's an asshole.

[01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:03.130]
Yeah.

[01:39:03.730 --> 01:39:07.150]
They really got the far it up and pissed off about Dave, that about cigar Dave.

[01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:11.490]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 0, and by the way, before we continue.

[01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:18.230]
So getting back to our 8,000 best actresses and best actors, I was thinking about this

[01:39:18.230 --> 01:39:18.910]
last night.

[01:39:20.090 --> 01:39:21.590]
What, how can you do this?

[01:39:22.270 --> 01:39:23.630]
It's an impossible list.

[01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:26.230]
I mean, you can have your favorite actors and favorite actors.

[01:39:26.230 --> 01:39:32.950]
It's like maybe five, five or six or, you know, but to say that one is better than

[01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:36.270]
the other, that Humphrey Bogart is the best actor whoever lives.

[01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:37.870]
Oh, my God.

[01:39:38.210 --> 01:39:43.330]
And of course, the thing again was their debut had to occur before 1951 or whose debut occurred

[01:39:43.330 --> 01:39:47.950]
after 1950, but who produced a significant body work before their death.

[01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:52.210]
So in other words, if they were a debut before 1951 and they're still alive, that's just

[01:39:52.210 --> 01:39:52.650]
still okay.

[01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:54.770]
But if they started after 1952, they got to be dead.

[01:39:55.170 --> 01:39:55.910]
You got that so far?

[01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:57.450]
Peter Finch, by the way, is dead.

[01:39:57.570 --> 01:39:58.870]
Somebody must have forgotten to tell them.

[01:39:59.430 --> 01:40:02.130]
Because Peter Finch, I know with no John Wayne, thank God.

[01:40:04.130 --> 01:40:05.290]
Or Gene Kelly.

[01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:06.610]
Gene Kelly was an actor.

[01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:06.850]
No.

[01:40:06.970 --> 01:40:10.090]
Gene Kelly was one of those silly dancing people like Fred Astaire and Dottalo Conner.

[01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:11.030]
He wasn't an actor.

[01:40:12.170 --> 01:40:13.470]
Gene Kelly was a great actor.

[01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:14.430]
That's an insult.

[01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:18.530]
James Dean, you know how many movies James Dean made by the way, don't you?

[01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.810]
Three.

[01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:23.130]
Three movies that the Fag made.

[01:40:23.290 --> 01:40:27.650]
I mean, I mean, James Dean, the Queen made three movies and then he died, that car crash.

[01:40:28.210 --> 01:40:30.090]
So how could James Dean possibly be one of the greatest?

[01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:31.570]
Another height job, okay?

[01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:33.070]
Another one was big height jobs.

[01:40:33.370 --> 01:40:33.930]
Three movies.

[01:40:34.130 --> 01:40:38.010]
He made Rebel Without A Cause, giant with that fat Liz Taylor.

[01:40:38.170 --> 01:40:38.690]
What was the other one?

[01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:42.330]
Those are two of them.

[01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:42.910]
Somebody will know.

[01:40:43.190 --> 01:40:44.190]
Not that it makes any difference.

[01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:47.790]
He only made three freaking movies and he smelled real bad too, by the way.

[01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:49.690]
That's what his boyfriends said.

[01:40:50.210 --> 01:40:50.670]
He stunk.

[01:40:52.650 --> 01:40:53.790]
Robert Mitcherman, he was good.

[01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:55.230]
I mean, there's some good people on this list.

[01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.850]
Don't get me wrong.

[01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:57.750]
Catherine Hepburn is the best actor.

[01:40:58.230 --> 01:41:01.910]
I blurred it out Betty Davis yesterday only because she's the number two on there and

[01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:02.990]
she's better than Catherine Hepburn.

[01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:05.230]
I couldn't take it the best after actress of all time.

[01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:09.950]
It's a silly pull, but like I said, it kills a lot of great time and we're really bored

[01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:10.490]
in this country.

[01:41:10.710 --> 01:41:12.710]
So let's argue about this frantically, fanatically.

[01:41:13.630 --> 01:41:14.230]
How about Elvis?

[01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:17.790]
I mean, if he's the most important person of the 20th century, he must also have been the

[01:41:17.790 --> 01:41:18.470]
best actor, right?

[01:41:18.630 --> 01:41:19.550]
Yeah, he was great.

[01:41:20.230 --> 01:41:21.530]
All those great Hawaiian movies.

[01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:23.230]
Here's Davy.

[01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.470]
Hello.

[01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:27.670]
Bell 4 is definitely in the bag for tonight.

[01:41:27.890 --> 01:41:27.990]
Yeah.

[01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:31.710]
Watch those panther, see who finds the penalty box first.

[01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:35.870]
And you sound awfully damn good on siteban.com.

[01:41:36.030 --> 01:41:36.730]
I couldn't believe this.

[01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:38.630]
You can listen to it down on a radio.

[01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:39.130]
Yeah.

[01:41:39.150 --> 01:41:43.510]
It's got you live on the radio at this website siteban.com.

[01:41:43.650 --> 01:41:44.370]
That's how I found you.

[01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:44.610]
Right.

[01:41:45.190 --> 01:41:51.610]
That's the, do you really believe that this is going to go seven theories, seven games?

[01:41:51.610 --> 01:41:54.970]
All I know is the longer it goes, the better that is for Buffalo.

[01:41:55.210 --> 01:41:58.970]
Because I tell you this Dallas team is old, old, old, baby.

[01:41:59.330 --> 01:42:01.890]
Geek carbono and Brian Scruelin and that Benoit.

[01:42:02.050 --> 01:42:07.310]
I hope that frog was coming back tonight and my keen and all these other old ancient guys

[01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:08.430]
they got on that team.

[01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:09.450]
Old man.

[01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:10.330]
That's what they did.

[01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:14.930]
They had downloaded what WOLLE at siteban.com before the game.

[01:42:15.230 --> 01:42:17.590]
So you can hear them pirate it before the game.

[01:42:17.710 --> 01:42:19.190]
These pirate and P3 downloads.

[01:42:19.490 --> 01:42:19.630]
Yeah.

[01:42:19.630 --> 01:42:22.230]
And it's often said that right before they go to the game.

[01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.810]
Oh really?

[01:42:23.010 --> 01:42:26.950]
And they've picked every, the Melrose even admitted at siteban.com.

[01:42:27.290 --> 01:42:29.470]
He's been going there to get his pixie.

[01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:30.630]
They've picked every game.

[01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:31.190]
I go there.

[01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:32.510]
I turn it on about five o'clock.

[01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:33.070]
Yeah.

[01:42:33.090 --> 01:42:35.250]
I wait for it at the sports section to be downloaded.

[01:42:35.610 --> 01:42:35.790]
Yeah.

[01:42:35.970 --> 01:42:37.350]
And they have like a little file there.

[01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:38.410]
You listen to the player.

[01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:39.630]
Well, what have I got to do with that?

[01:42:39.730 --> 01:42:40.450]
How come I'm on there?

[01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:41.030]
I don't understand.

[01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:42.130]
It's for a radio.

[01:42:42.330 --> 01:42:42.650]
Oh, I see.

[01:42:43.010 --> 01:42:44.270]
You know, it's like a music.

[01:42:45.150 --> 01:42:49.350]
And then I think it's spinner and one of the radio sites and it listens to QAM.

[01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:50.070]
Yeah.

[01:42:50.690 --> 01:42:51.350]
I'm on the internet.

[01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:51.650]
Great.

[01:42:51.810 --> 01:42:52.150]
Thank God.

[01:42:52.190 --> 01:42:53.890]
Well, I know I'm on the internet, but I didn't realize that.

[01:42:54.010 --> 01:42:54.330]
That's what I was on at site.

[01:42:54.330 --> 01:42:55.150]
We're all over the place.

[01:42:55.290 --> 01:42:55.890]
Thank God for that.

[01:42:55.970 --> 01:42:56.650]
Thanks for the good news.

[01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:59.290]
Hey, I want a chance for my kids for the tickets.

[01:42:59.390 --> 01:43:01.070]
And go saverers and go work at the NRED.

[01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:01.770]
Oh, is he gone?

[01:43:01.890 --> 01:43:02.930]
He's going to give him some tickets.

[01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:04.310]
He's gone?

[01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:05.690]
Uh-huh.

[01:43:05.850 --> 01:43:06.790]
Oh, damn it.

[01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.570]
Fine.

[01:43:07.670 --> 01:43:09.050]
Well, of course, I'm going to hung up on him.

[01:43:09.090 --> 01:43:09.990]
But how could he be gone already?

[01:43:10.150 --> 01:43:11.550]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 10, 60.

[01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:13.030]
I mean, he was a good call, too.

[01:43:13.170 --> 01:43:13.870]
He was very enthusiastic.

[01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:16.070]
He actually did a little bit of hockey and a good guy.

[01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:17.230]
And I hung up on him.

[01:43:17.230 --> 01:43:17.870]
Well, it's just a reflex.

[01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:21.450]
You know, I figured when a call was done, I put my finger on it off button and he's gone.

[01:43:21.650 --> 01:43:22.230]
And he was done.

[01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:24.290]
He didn't know it yet, but he knows it now.

[01:43:24.930 --> 01:43:28.770]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, he pounds 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:43:29.650 --> 01:43:30.010]
Come on.

[01:43:30.110 --> 01:43:32.050]
Best actor and best actress of all time, huh?

[01:43:33.310 --> 01:43:35.710]
I'm looking on this list for somebody that really like stands out.

[01:43:36.250 --> 01:43:38.710]
And William Holden is down there on the bottom right under Edward G. Robinson.

[01:43:39.090 --> 01:43:41.270]
I mean, Edward G. Robinson was a good character actor.

[01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:44.870]
He was always like a gangster, but I mean, he was always the same.

[01:43:45.090 --> 01:43:47.290]
You know, every movie he was in, he played the same character.

[01:43:47.690 --> 01:43:50.670]
Tough gangster with a cigar and a gun and the same thing.

[01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:53.050]
He was, you know, what he was.

[01:43:53.470 --> 01:43:53.870]
He was okay.

[01:43:54.670 --> 01:43:56.790]
Certainly not one of the top 25 actors of all time.

[01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:59.430]
And more than James Dean, who only made three movies or Gene Kelly,

[01:43:59.710 --> 01:44:01.230]
who danced to the Reign 2 God then much.

[01:44:02.210 --> 01:44:03.230]
East of Eden was a...

[01:44:03.230 --> 01:44:04.430]
East of Eden, thank you so much.

[01:44:04.730 --> 01:44:05.230]
The turd.

[01:44:05.250 --> 01:44:08.730]
That was the turd movie by James Dean along with Rebel Without A Cause and Giant.

[01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:09.510]
It's gigantic.

[01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:12.590]
That's what that Faghaeg Liz Taylor said.

[01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:14.930]
And there's another person, by the way, I don't want to hear about her.

[01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:16.670]
That's a good contest.

[01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:18.410]
Will Smith or Liz Taylor?

[01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:19.890]
Which one can you handle?

[01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:21.730]
Not one more award and Ricky Martin.

[01:44:21.850 --> 01:44:23.470]
There's all that he wins hands down.

[01:44:24.090 --> 01:44:25.910]
Hands down is pantaloon because he wins.

[01:44:27.010 --> 01:44:31.130]
I'd rather sit home and watch a Will Smith Liz Taylor Film Festival all day

[01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:33.590]
than hear Ricky Martin's name mention one more time.

[01:44:34.210 --> 01:44:36.150]
Or listen to those off-key songs that he's singing.

[01:44:36.570 --> 01:44:37.270]
That he's sneering.

[01:44:40.810 --> 01:44:41.610]
Oh God.

[01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:44.170]
Who are you kidding, Hootsie Cootsie?

[01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:50.770]
The women of the world and especially of the US of A were his biggest successes, by the way, in this country.

[01:44:53.050 --> 01:44:56.130]
And you guys out there, you're lucky to sell it because most of the women in this country

[01:44:56.130 --> 01:44:57.710]
their taste is deep inside there.

[01:44:57.750 --> 01:45:01.310]
I mean, maybe that's what all those straight guys are probing for, you know.

[01:45:02.970 --> 01:45:04.270]
Maybe that's what they're looking for in there.

[01:45:06.370 --> 01:45:08.490]
Because they're sure a lot of search parties out there.

[01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:11.670]
Ricky Martin, come on.

[01:45:11.770 --> 01:45:14.130]
I mean, I will grant you we don't look bad as long as he's not moving.

[01:45:14.370 --> 01:45:17.390]
As soon as he starts moving and you don't have a tonal on the ground,

[01:45:17.730 --> 01:45:19.050]
then you start like sniggering a little.

[01:45:19.690 --> 01:45:22.210]
And don't say sniggering because they get nervous about that.

[01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:23.970]
Here's Hollywood. Hello.

[01:45:25.110 --> 01:45:25.870]
Neil, how's it going?

[01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.610]
Pretty good, sir.

[01:45:27.130 --> 01:45:28.290]
I was just calling about those tickets.

[01:45:28.770 --> 01:45:29.410]
What do you mean by that?

[01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:30.870]
You still giving them away?

[01:45:31.050 --> 01:45:31.210]
No.

[01:45:32.110 --> 01:45:33.070]
Oh, look at this.

[01:45:33.130 --> 01:45:34.730]
Here's one of the great Americans.

[01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:35.590]
I can't believe this.

[01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:39.170]
I was thinking about this man yesterday as I was watching the prices of all my stocks fall

[01:45:39.170 --> 01:45:40.970]
while all the other stocks were going up to head, David.

[01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:42.010]
Hey, how are you?

[01:45:42.170 --> 01:45:42.810]
Are you back here?

[01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:45.990]
No, in fact, I'm sitting in my desk shoving a pizza down here.

[01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.870]
Listen to you on the internet.

[01:45:47.010 --> 01:45:48.610]
I have to ask you a question, seriously.

[01:45:48.750 --> 01:45:51.210]
I know I asked you this last time you called and it's probably boring to you.

[01:45:51.330 --> 01:45:55.130]
But, you know, I'm a big fan of your network because I want to see all my stocks keep dropping

[01:45:55.130 --> 01:45:56.150]
and they're doing a good job of that.

[01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:59.290]
But what kind of these people ever sleep?

[01:45:59.290 --> 01:46:01.430]
I mean, these guys, you're one of those guys.

[01:46:01.630 --> 01:46:02.170]
You're there any afternoon.

[01:46:02.170 --> 01:46:04.990]
Obviously, you must have some cloud because you're not working 20 hours a day.

[01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:10.110]
But like Joe Kernen and Maria Bartiromo, for example, and the David Watson, they important David,

[01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:12.710]
they're under like now 7-20 in the morning.

[01:46:12.850 --> 01:46:14.850]
I see them when I get up and I come home any afternoon.

[01:46:14.850 --> 01:46:17.050]
They're there four, they're there five, they're there with six.

[01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:18.270]
What kind of a deal is that?

[01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:19.450]
Hey, sir, give it up to your apartments.

[01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:21.170]
They're giving up their lives, I think.

[01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.970]
They do work hard.

[01:46:23.230 --> 01:46:23.770]
That's amazing.

[01:46:24.510 --> 01:46:27.930]
I tell you, you know you got really marginal stocks when the market goes up 200 points

[01:46:27.930 --> 01:46:29.910]
and the last that goes up was it like 90 yesterday?

[01:46:30.130 --> 01:46:30.290]
Yeah.

[01:46:30.370 --> 01:46:31.490]
And everything you got basically the...

[01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:33.550]
I was at 102 was the biggest one day point gain ever.

[01:46:33.710 --> 01:46:36.010]
And basically what I got still went down, how do you like that?

[01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:37.530]
You buying a wrong stocks back?

[01:46:38.530 --> 01:46:39.590]
Yeah, now you're telling me that.

[01:46:40.750 --> 01:46:45.030]
I just got to tell you, I was down there in the in May and I had a good day out at Close My Mother's Condo

[01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:47.290]
and fortunately it was a weekend and I missed you.

[01:46:47.530 --> 01:46:49.150]
Oh, there you go.

[01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:49.510]
Yeah.

[01:46:49.930 --> 01:46:51.770]
You weren't there and I didn't know what to do with myself.

[01:46:52.130 --> 01:46:54.670]
And why should if you would have told me how to come in on a weekend just for you?

[01:46:54.710 --> 01:46:55.830]
I bet you would have.

[01:46:55.830 --> 01:47:01.570]
When I tell people that Ted David from CNBC calls this show, they think I must be loaded with the hot stock tips or something.

[01:47:01.810 --> 01:47:06.130]
Not only that, I got got some pleasant email from some listeners who were also viewers.

[01:47:06.410 --> 01:47:06.590]
Really?

[01:47:06.890 --> 01:47:07.030]
Yeah.

[01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:12.830]
In fact, I interviewed the CEO of Real Networks not long ago and I thanked him for his product

[01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:17.790]
and I specifically said on the air I want to thank you because it allows me to listen to Neil Rogers and my amy.

[01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:19.790]
Yeah, I heard what I was talking about.

[01:47:19.930 --> 01:47:24.250]
I had 50,000 calls like that to tell me, oh Ted David just give you a plug on the air and I said no that's great.

[01:47:24.250 --> 01:47:26.010]
How about a stock tip would be better?

[01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:28.090]
I need some tips for myself first.

[01:47:28.610 --> 01:47:30.530]
Come on, you guys did work on CNBC.

[01:47:30.770 --> 01:47:32.430]
You guys must be getting something.

[01:47:32.650 --> 01:47:37.570]
Those guys aren't getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning and working 12 hour broadcast days just for the hell of it.

[01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:41.810]
I hate the disillusioned you but honest to God we are really a bunch of honest people.

[01:47:42.210 --> 01:47:42.330]
Yeah.

[01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:45.670]
Which means you don't know any more than we do.

[01:47:46.590 --> 01:47:51.890]
Well, I can tell you honestly the only one and only stock tip I ever got was before I worked here and I lost money on it.

[01:47:51.890 --> 01:47:56.050]
I'm a human contraindicator if I buy it it goes down and I sell it it goes up.

[01:47:56.090 --> 01:48:00.530]
Maybe that's why we gravitate toward each other Ted because you go to whatever we buy it goes right on the old crap or right.

[01:48:01.290 --> 01:48:02.410]
Well it's great hearing from you.

[01:48:03.570 --> 01:48:07.830]
If it weren't for the internet I'd go nuts. I would not get my daily dose of Neil so thank you.

[01:48:07.930 --> 01:48:08.890]
I feel greatly honored.

[01:48:09.550 --> 01:48:12.030]
And I'm honored that I get on so easily so.

[01:48:13.130 --> 01:48:15.470]
We'll put you right to the front of the line.

[01:48:15.890 --> 01:48:17.110]
Talk to you next time down there.

[01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:18.010]
Okay, Zagrishan.

[01:48:18.090 --> 01:48:19.150]
I'll start the fire line and say hi to mom.

[01:48:19.630 --> 01:48:20.110]
Thanks, take care.

[01:48:20.710 --> 01:48:22.350]
Ted David from CNBC.

[01:48:22.570 --> 01:48:23.310]
There you go.

[01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:24.670]
You see what did I tell you?

[01:48:24.730 --> 01:48:28.390]
You shipped through 50,000 calls and you get somebody that's a real mention here a celebrity.

[01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:31.090]
Still won't give me any stock tips.

[01:48:31.670 --> 01:48:34.390]
26 past noon at 560 WQM will rent.

[01:48:34.590 --> 01:48:36.550]
Holy cow, Aaron's coming.

[01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:44.950]
Hello and welcome to Redneck CSI, a collection of fine literary works has performed by that society element.

[01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:51.450]
Most likely to consume large quantities of ethanol containing liquids at their sister's wedding.

[01:48:51.970 --> 01:48:56.010]
Which incidentally happens to be their wedding as well?

[01:48:56.610 --> 01:49:00.710]
Today's presentation is the project tale that is Richard the founder.

[01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:05.170]
Well, in the world are they can tell.

[01:49:06.150 --> 01:49:09.810]
They glory the summer, remember by the sun of York.

[01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:15.610]
And all the clouds of the dirt upon our house in the date.

[01:49:16.010 --> 01:49:17.730]
Blizz them on the ocean bears.

[01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:20.570]
Ah, simply marvelous.

[01:49:21.190 --> 01:49:26.530]
Join us next time for another most eating edition of Redneck CSI.

[01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:28.630]
Okay, we'll go 12.30 to 5.60.

[01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:32.190]
By the way, for that obnoxious lot of New Yorker that I know you're still listening right now to call before.

[01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:34.830]
And it's called it several times over the years because he never misses a minute of this show.

[01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:36.810]
Has anybody from CNBC called you today?

[01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.110]
No.

[01:49:37.110 --> 01:49:38.190]
You jackass.

[01:49:38.650 --> 01:49:41.870]
I don't want to start being a name dropper because we already got some of those people in the station.

[01:49:41.870 --> 01:49:43.010]
I don't want to start doing that.

[01:49:43.130 --> 01:49:43.290]
But.

[01:49:44.910 --> 01:49:46.450]
Now he's a good guy today, but okay.

[01:49:46.610 --> 01:49:47.250]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:47.670]
Oh.

[01:49:47.930 --> 01:49:48.350]
Good you, boy.

[01:49:49.130 --> 01:49:51.650]
Only guy with two first names that I know you can trust.

[01:49:52.610 --> 01:49:53.330]
Here's Timberpine.

[01:49:53.410 --> 01:49:53.630]
Hello.

[01:49:54.770 --> 01:49:55.130]
Hello.

[01:49:55.410 --> 01:49:55.750]
Yes, sir.

[01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:58.650]
I just want to call you and thank you.

[01:49:58.750 --> 01:49:59.930]
I went down and next took the tour.

[01:50:00.170 --> 01:50:00.670]
Another guy.

[01:50:00.810 --> 01:50:01.170]
I'll write.

[01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:03.850]
Got myself a bundle and a couple of the Delmar reserve.

[01:50:03.930 --> 01:50:05.130]
The perfect those are.

[01:50:05.130 --> 01:50:05.570]
I'm on.

[01:50:05.950 --> 01:50:06.130]
Yeah.

[01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:07.030]
Absolutely excellent.

[01:50:07.130 --> 01:50:07.390]
They are.

[01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:09.770]
No, they don't even get a chance to call you.

[01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:10.250]
I'm on the road.

[01:50:10.350 --> 01:50:11.930]
Next time check out these Cuban bullets.

[01:50:12.890 --> 01:50:13.330]
Those are theirs.

[01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:14.010]
Yeah.

[01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.510]
Okay.

[01:50:14.890 --> 01:50:16.110]
I'm going to go one of my hand right now.

[01:50:16.190 --> 01:50:17.670]
I wish I could light it, but they're great.

[01:50:19.110 --> 01:50:19.410]
Yeah.

[01:50:19.570 --> 01:50:20.910]
Well, that sounds good.

[01:50:21.670 --> 01:50:22.210]
Yeah, they could.

[01:50:22.490 --> 01:50:25.910]
I was very surprised because I'm down there and I met with Nick.

[01:50:26.830 --> 01:50:27.150]
Nick.

[01:50:27.150 --> 01:50:27.890]
One of the owners of my team.

[01:50:28.050 --> 01:50:28.050]

[01:50:28.290 --> 01:50:29.970]
I think it was Nick who goes.

[01:50:32.110 --> 01:50:34.570]
There's Nick Senior, which is the old man, the father.

[01:50:34.710 --> 01:50:36.550]
There's Nick Jr. who's kind of a pudgy great guy.

[01:50:36.650 --> 01:50:37.170]
Yeah, that was him.

[01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.430]
The junior.

[01:50:38.010 --> 01:50:38.190]
That's not.

[01:50:38.290 --> 01:50:38.850]
He's great.

[01:50:39.190 --> 01:50:39.950]
And he gave me the tour.

[01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:42.430]
And I don't know.

[01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:46.590]
I just thought it was great and why I just pressed my gratitude.

[01:50:46.850 --> 01:50:47.170]
Outstanding.

[01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.670]
Thanks a lot.

[01:50:47.930 --> 01:50:48.110]
I give.

[01:50:48.570 --> 01:50:49.150]
There you go.

[01:50:49.190 --> 01:50:50.750]
We got a lot of happy campus from next today.

[01:50:50.970 --> 01:50:51.530]
Oh, yeah.

[01:50:51.590 --> 01:50:54.010]
How is Neil going to make it with those little cigar stops on there?

[01:50:54.150 --> 01:50:56.270]
That's what that butt plot from my 100 was saying, huh?

[01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:57.010]
That's footy.

[01:50:57.190 --> 01:50:58.930]
Well, I'll tell you what you can do with your foot footy.

[01:50:59.890 --> 01:51:00.250]
Yeah.

[01:51:01.210 --> 01:51:03.130]
How are we going to do with those little mom and pops here?

[01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:03.970]
Oh, brother.

[01:51:04.630 --> 01:51:06.510]
You know, if you know anything about the business, okay?

[01:51:06.630 --> 01:51:08.650]
You'd understand how much we're getting for spots on this show.

[01:51:08.890 --> 01:51:10.790]
You know, how much money the station is making on this show?

[01:51:11.170 --> 01:51:12.110]
Raking in the big bucks.

[01:51:13.610 --> 01:51:14.930]
And that's the only question.

[01:51:15.110 --> 01:51:19.010]
There's no question that this station is making money handover, money handover, limperous.

[01:51:19.150 --> 01:51:19.850]
That's not a doubt.

[01:51:20.290 --> 01:51:23.430]
The only question is, where the hell's it going besides in John Henry's pocket?

[01:51:23.770 --> 01:51:24.770]
And Wayne High Pingers pocket.

[01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:26.330]
And of course, the bee-leaves.

[01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:28.830]
If they have any pockets in those old rumpal suits, they were.

[01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:32.410]
I don't think they'd be able to put money in their pockets because they'd probably fall out on the ground.

[01:51:34.050 --> 01:51:37.530]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the mobile.

[01:51:37.670 --> 01:51:40.310]
And of course, a lot of people out there think that I'm joking about the beesleaves.

[01:51:40.450 --> 01:51:40.990]
Oh, boy.

[01:51:41.210 --> 01:51:42.370]
To see them is to know them.

[01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:43.230]
Trust me when I tell you.

[01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:45.630]
They have that just topped out of that dumpster look.

[01:51:47.190 --> 01:51:48.010]
Here's the homestead.

[01:51:48.090 --> 01:51:48.250]
Hello?

[01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:49.830]
Neil.

[01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.410]
Yes, sir.

[01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:52.730]
I was just looking at just looking at the whole house.

[01:51:52.770 --> 01:51:55.910]
I was looking to the channel last night and saw this wood show.

[01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:58.930]
And I saw this huge chin on the screen, it would happen to be Jay Leno.

[01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.430]
Yeah.

[01:51:59.570 --> 01:52:03.610]
Given away some award to John Fervolte for a global wholesome crap.

[01:52:05.370 --> 01:52:05.770]
Yeah.

[01:52:05.930 --> 01:52:06.250]
Yeah.

[01:52:06.490 --> 01:52:11.130]
And he walks up on the stage with his little go-t and stuff and straddles Jay Leno.

[01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:12.690]
I'm thinking of myself.

[01:52:12.890 --> 01:52:13.290]
Straddle them?

[01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:14.310]
Straddle them.

[01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:14.710]
Yeah.

[01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:16.890]
Trying to pull you how it's done in there.

[01:52:17.130 --> 01:52:17.410]
Uh-huh.

[01:52:17.770 --> 01:52:18.950]
It was the blockbuster movie awards.

[01:52:19.210 --> 01:52:20.070]
Oh, there you go.

[01:52:20.090 --> 01:52:20.170]
Oh, there you go.

[01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:21.550]
Yeah, that explains it.

[01:52:22.130 --> 01:52:25.210]
It's got to get inside or inside or every year that Dan's Scientologist.

[01:52:25.210 --> 01:52:25.770]
Yeah.

[01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:27.250]
It was a little clay table.

[01:52:27.410 --> 01:52:29.070]
Probably put too much mayonnaise on those fries.

[01:52:29.250 --> 01:52:29.730]
That'll do it.

[01:52:30.070 --> 01:52:31.010]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:52:31.070 --> 01:52:31.290]
All right.

[01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:32.090]
Thanks for the good news.

[01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.670]
Okay.

[01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:33.110]
There you go.

[01:52:33.250 --> 01:52:35.410]
John Fervolte is straddling Jay Leno.

[01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.650]
Spread the word.

[01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:37.350]
Spread the report.

[01:52:37.490 --> 01:52:39.610]
It's probably Jose Lambietl put on his insider there.

[01:52:40.230 --> 01:52:41.130]
Along with all the other crap.

[01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:42.870]
By the way, congratulations Jose.

[01:52:43.290 --> 01:52:46.190]
A whole column in a Sunstintless morning didn't mention Ricky Martin once.

[01:52:46.330 --> 01:52:46.990]
Oh, right.

[01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:50.490]
And that sexual enigma that surrounds Ricky Martin.

[01:52:50.490 --> 01:52:52.970]
Like there's some big mystery about his sexual orientation.

[01:52:53.610 --> 01:52:55.070]
There's a mystery if you dev done blind.

[01:52:55.090 --> 01:52:55.810]
That's right, Jose.

[01:52:58.290 --> 01:52:59.970]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:53:00.450 --> 01:53:02.550]
Pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:05.810]
I mean, I don't wish I mean if Ricky Martin's going to make $50 billion from all that.

[01:53:05.890 --> 01:53:08.090]
If there are a lot of people with bad taste, more power to him.

[01:53:08.210 --> 01:53:08.330]
Okay.

[01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:09.570]
It's the 300-price system.

[01:53:09.730 --> 01:53:10.790]
It's the American F and Wade.

[01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:13.130]
But I don't want to hear about it.

[01:53:14.270 --> 01:53:14.990]
Here's North Miami.

[01:53:15.010 --> 01:53:15.330]
Hello.

[01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:16.070]
Yeah.

[01:53:16.170 --> 01:53:16.690]
How you doing, Al?

[01:53:16.770 --> 01:53:16.950]
Great.

[01:53:17.610 --> 01:53:17.990]
You know what?

[01:53:18.630 --> 01:53:21.210]
He's talking about all movie stars.

[01:53:21.210 --> 01:53:28.570]
Well, your movie star that I really like is Candy, Reft, Garfield, Tracy and the Muni.

[01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:29.090]
Yeah.

[01:53:29.590 --> 01:53:30.150]
Well, well, well.

[01:53:30.330 --> 01:53:31.930]
Well, we're talking about it from this century though.

[01:53:32.210 --> 01:53:32.410]
Pardon?

[01:53:32.970 --> 01:53:34.310]
I said, good last thank you.

[01:53:35.630 --> 01:53:39.290]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:53:41.070 --> 01:53:44.030]
Doesn't he sound a little bit like the guy who said that the nervous guy?

[01:53:44.590 --> 01:53:44.670]
Huh?

[01:53:45.190 --> 01:53:45.590]
Like...

[01:53:46.770 --> 01:53:47.770]
Let me see.

[01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:48.410]
I'm a little nervous.

[01:53:48.570 --> 01:53:50.590]
I never called him already before.

[01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:51.490]
But I knew it was a rest.

[01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:53.010]
Yeah, I love the way he's snorkeling.

[01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:54.170]
Yeah, that's my favorite.

[01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:58.150]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:53:59.790 --> 01:54:01.450]
Haven't heard from the nervous call in a long time.

[01:54:01.570 --> 01:54:02.070]
I wonder why.

[01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:03.030]
Stupid idiot.

[01:54:03.810 --> 01:54:07.310]
Anyway, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:54:07.410 --> 01:54:08.930]
We keep prodding and plugging along here.

[01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:11.610]
Before we know it will be one o'clock, before we know it will be two o'clock.

[01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:12.670]
The hump will be in the building.

[01:54:12.750 --> 01:54:13.310]
He'll be on the air.

[01:54:13.890 --> 01:54:14.710]
The theme song will end.

[01:54:14.750 --> 01:54:15.450]
The show might start.

[01:54:16.270 --> 01:54:19.550]
Well, they only got like 16, 17 people here today to work on Hang Show.

[01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:21.470]
So, you know, it's a little rougher on the edges.

[01:54:21.610 --> 01:54:22.590]
It might not be as good as usual.

[01:54:23.050 --> 01:54:24.170]
Then we got Josh Darrow.

[01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:27.990]
Probably will have to leave Hang Show early today, so we can work on a big 6 to 8 show tonight.

[01:54:28.710 --> 01:54:29.870]
Clarence will be on her 6 to 8.

[01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.470]
Talking to us.

[01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:31.230]
I'm having to do these stuff.

[01:54:31.650 --> 01:54:34.510]
And I'm sure hockey intensive will be hockey intensive.

[01:54:34.650 --> 01:54:34.770]
No.

[01:54:34.890 --> 01:54:36.750]
Because he's doing the, for the, for the, uh, the, uh, the, uh,

[01:54:36.750 --> 01:54:37.210]
Prelude there.

[01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:41.610]
The lead in the, uh, NHL game number five stand-up championship.

[01:54:42.650 --> 01:54:43.550]
Buffalo at Dallas.

[01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:46.410]
So you think that Josh should be really wet up on that hockey.

[01:54:46.710 --> 01:54:46.790]
Is it?

[01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:47.030]
No.

[01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.530]
I don't know.

[01:54:47.670 --> 01:54:49.110]
I don't even know if he doesn't really think about hockey.

[01:54:50.150 --> 01:54:52.110]
If he does, he'd be sure of already in this building.

[01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:53.710]
Here's sunrise.

[01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:54.030]
Hello.

[01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:55.610]
Neil.

[01:54:55.950 --> 01:54:56.250]
Yes, sir.

[01:54:56.290 --> 01:54:57.430]
Yeah, I just speaking.

[01:54:57.910 --> 01:55:02.170]
Hey, Pond for Pound are world's greatest actor, Marlon Brando.

[01:55:02.410 --> 01:55:02.630]
Yeah.

[01:55:03.210 --> 01:55:04.870]
Yeah, if you go by the pond, I would agree with that.

[01:55:05.370 --> 01:55:06.750]
There's no Don Deloise, but.

[01:55:07.450 --> 01:55:10.090]
Hey, how come they left off Don Deloise in all those great, uh,

[01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:11.210]
Burnt Reynolds movies?

[01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:14.970]
You know, you haven't been, uh, carting up that phone a long time, even.

[01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:16.090]
Yeah, that's a good point.

[01:55:16.090 --> 01:55:17.650]
I kind of missed the honey juniors.

[01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:18.570]
Yeah.

[01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:20.530]
Yeah, that honey juniors.

[01:55:20.850 --> 01:55:21.350]
Yeah, boy.

[01:55:21.850 --> 01:55:22.910]
Yeah, I'm cruising through sunrise.

[01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:24.870]
I haven't seen you in a long time.

[01:55:25.290 --> 01:55:25.430]
Yeah.

[01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:27.250]
I want to ask you two questions.

[01:55:27.850 --> 01:55:30.690]
Strip malls that are empty, completely empty in there.

[01:55:31.930 --> 01:55:32.410]
Why?

[01:55:32.770 --> 01:55:35.190]
There's nobody up here buying a shop owner that they just...

[01:55:35.190 --> 01:55:36.090]
Where was this?

[01:55:38.330 --> 01:55:38.790]
Sunrise.

[01:55:39.170 --> 01:55:39.470]
Sunrise.

[01:55:40.230 --> 01:55:41.870]
Oh, I'm just right now.

[01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.670]
I'm up to McNabb.

[01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:43.270]
Yeah.

[01:55:43.810 --> 01:55:44.690]
And it's like...

[01:55:44.690 --> 01:55:45.550]
And you have to ask that.

[01:55:45.550 --> 01:55:47.030]
So, you have to ask that question?

[01:55:47.650 --> 01:55:48.370]
Oh, my God.

[01:55:48.370 --> 01:55:51.450]
Which is we just have 50,000 too many strip shopping malls,

[01:55:51.650 --> 01:55:54.110]
and about 25 too many big shopping malls.

[01:55:54.250 --> 01:55:55.370]
Other than that, there's no other reason.

[01:55:55.770 --> 01:55:58.910]
And you can't see a sign for a storefront anywhere in sight.

[01:55:59.150 --> 01:55:59.350]
Right.

[01:55:59.510 --> 01:56:00.890]
There's a quarter of a mile back off the roof.

[01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:03.170]
Plus, you got to understand the deeper you go into the heart of sunrise,

[01:56:03.170 --> 01:56:04.390]
the more dead people you'll find.

[01:56:04.530 --> 01:56:06.050]
I mean, most of those people are over the age of 100.

[01:56:06.210 --> 01:56:06.530]
You can...

[01:56:06.530 --> 01:56:08.090]
It's entirely over the banks.

[01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:11.930]
Between them and the Jackie Mason wannabe is on every corner.

[01:56:12.170 --> 01:56:12.330]
Yeah.

[01:56:12.850 --> 01:56:13.390]
Okay, pal.

[01:56:13.630 --> 01:56:15.130]
I'll get out of there as soon as possible.

[01:56:15.850 --> 01:56:18.190]
5, 6, 7, we got 600 open lines here right at the moment,

[01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:21.090]
by getting in and get some of those great tickets for Tarzan the Cartoon.

[01:56:21.730 --> 01:56:25.490]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:56:25.590 --> 01:56:26.730]
Where'd you get that from to the day, by the way?

[01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:28.650]
Were you eating those great sub-sahemages from...

[01:56:28.650 --> 01:56:29.630]
Is that from Tony's band chain?

[01:56:30.290 --> 01:56:30.850]
From Chucks?

[01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.630]
From...

[01:56:31.630 --> 01:56:32.110]
It is from Chucks.

[01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:34.530]
Oh, it's from the sub-center, our good buddy Chucks.

[01:56:34.630 --> 01:56:35.510]
I would leave him out.

[01:56:35.590 --> 01:56:36.790]
That didn't look like Chucks, by the way.

[01:56:38.530 --> 01:56:39.470]
Chucks sent somebody over here.

[01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:40.330]
Well, Chucks probably busy.

[01:56:40.450 --> 01:56:41.370]
We hope he's busy over there.

[01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:41.850]
Number one.

[01:56:42.130 --> 01:56:42.470]
And, huh?

[01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:44.310]
That would be Jay Holliday bringing it up.

[01:56:44.590 --> 01:56:45.710]
So they can't get upstairs, remember?

[01:56:46.050 --> 01:56:46.490]
Well, that's right.

[01:56:46.630 --> 01:56:46.910]
They can't...

[01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:47.930]
Oh, I forgot about that.

[01:56:48.090 --> 01:56:49.610]
Most of the people can't get upstairs here.

[01:56:49.610 --> 01:56:52.710]
This is a great deal we got going, because we're up here on the third floor now.

[01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:54.570]
We used to be on the second floor.

[01:56:54.670 --> 01:56:55.910]
Everybody else is on the third floor.

[01:56:56.210 --> 01:56:57.470]
They moved us up to the third floor.

[01:56:57.730 --> 01:56:59.610]
All of a sudden, everybody else moved down to the second floor.

[01:56:59.710 --> 01:57:00.730]
I think they're trying to tell us something.

[01:57:00.850 --> 01:57:01.030]
Uh-huh.

[01:57:01.810 --> 01:57:04.690]
I was thinking that this morning, I saw one of those construction trucks outside

[01:57:04.690 --> 01:57:05.330]
with a bunch of crap.

[01:57:05.690 --> 01:57:06.570]
And I'm thinking this is...

[01:57:06.570 --> 01:57:08.850]
This is so typical of Beasley and Reed, man.

[01:57:08.850 --> 01:57:11.890]
The longest construction project in the history of mankind.

[01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:13.110]
No one anywhere.

[01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:17.190]
Even John Holmes never saw a longer erection than what's going on here.

[01:57:17.710 --> 01:57:18.390]
Got it.

[01:57:19.850 --> 01:57:23.390]
And you notice, like out in the front where the desk used to be out there,

[01:57:23.470 --> 01:57:24.230]
the receptionist...

[01:57:24.230 --> 01:57:25.050]
There's just nothing.

[01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:26.430]
There's nothing going on out there.

[01:57:26.490 --> 01:57:27.570]
There's nothing being built there.

[01:57:27.710 --> 01:57:28.290]
There's nothing.

[01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:32.650]
So I haven't got any idea what the construction workers are doing, you know,

[01:57:32.810 --> 01:57:33.470]
or who they're doing.

[01:57:33.930 --> 01:57:34.590]
Maybe each other.

[01:57:34.710 --> 01:57:36.390]
I don't know, but they're sure they're nothing going on in this place.

[01:57:36.670 --> 01:57:38.130]
And it just goes on...

[01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:41.490]
Hey, that's the way it's gone, baby, because we've got to give John Henry and Wayne all the money.

[01:57:44.130 --> 01:57:47.370]
Twenty-four-one and five-sixty WQM, if you want...

[01:57:47.370 --> 01:57:48.890]
Oh, yes, what? That was the end of that break.

[01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:50.470]
Father or two, God...

[01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:54.230]
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could offer only one tip for the future.

[01:57:55.770 --> 01:57:58.510]
Act strange, and people will leave you alone.

[01:57:59.970 --> 01:58:04.490]
The rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience.

[01:58:07.170 --> 01:58:11.550]
Put us fling you around your neck and try to walk downstairs backwards headfirst.

[01:58:12.290 --> 01:58:15.910]
Sit naked in a large bowl of rice crispsies and sing feelings

[01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:18.250]
while the kernels go snuff crackle and puff.

[01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:24.030]
Go up to a ticket booth and try to stick your heads at the hole where they say how much.

[01:58:25.130 --> 01:58:26.270]
Lick, a stranger.

[01:58:27.210 --> 01:58:30.070]
Tell him you're from Bosnia and you're a country to sign a respect.

[01:58:31.650 --> 01:58:35.070]
Take lots of pills. One of them might work.

[01:58:36.670 --> 01:58:39.650]
Occasionally, ask the stranger if they've heard anything from Lewis.

[01:58:41.490 --> 01:58:42.450]
Be annoying.

[01:58:44.050 --> 01:58:48.050]
During an IRS audit, staple the guy's hand to his desk.

[01:58:50.050 --> 01:58:51.390]
Moon, a funeral.

[01:58:52.670 --> 01:58:55.670]
Play Gofetch with a C&I dog while he's working.

[01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:58.830]
Run naked through a mall yelling.

[01:58:58.830 --> 01:59:01.090]
Kill her bees. Kill her bees.

[01:59:02.370 --> 01:59:04.890]
Say the word titty without smiling.

[01:59:06.210 --> 01:59:09.330]
Try to figure out who said Paulie Shore should star in movies.

[01:59:10.070 --> 01:59:14.090]
Don't be surprised if it's the same guy who said John Gacy should work with kids.

[01:59:16.630 --> 01:59:21.250]
Ask an old lady if you can carry her groceries and try to make a run for it.

[01:59:22.370 --> 01:59:24.170]
This appear for great lengths of time.

[01:59:25.490 --> 01:59:27.430]
Try to touch your forehead with your tongue.

[01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:31.610]
It may not work, but many women will appreciate the effort.

[01:59:33.330 --> 01:59:38.010]
At a high school reunion, tell your old English teacher that your dog is still leaving your home with.

[01:59:39.690 --> 01:59:43.230]
Ask Mark McGuire to take a million dollars for one of his bulls.

[01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:46.810]
Try to find the secret to care for top success.

[01:59:48.030 --> 01:59:50.050]
Understand your conception was an accident.

[01:59:50.590 --> 01:59:54.510]
That your parents got wasted and wanted a few more last before they passed out.

[01:59:56.210 --> 01:59:58.710]
Try not to lose your finger in your nose.

[01:59:59.490 --> 02:00:02.090]
Take a bobcustis and toss them on the lawn next door.

[02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:06.090]
Go on a car trip with bobcustis and force them to stay in his car seat.

[02:00:06.850 --> 02:00:08.410]
Try to dribble bobcustis.

[02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:12.170]
Ask all your friends and family for forgiveness.

[02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:16.310]
Knowing you, you've done some crap that's really pissed them off.

[02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:20.210]
Wish no ill-willed anyone, unless you don't like them.

[02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:22.030]
Then screw them around their own.

[02:00:23.230 --> 02:00:27.210]
Realize anyone who says they're completely happy or completely full of crap.

[02:00:28.090 --> 02:00:32.450]
Ask a hell of a woman or hell of a woman.

[02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:37.010]
Understand that there are bad people in the world and you may just be one of them.

[02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:39.210]
Sniff and old lady.

[02:00:40.850 --> 02:00:43.810]
Imagine Gomer Pyle and the gay bar trying to get lucky.

[02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:46.150]
Do this without laughing.

[02:00:47.450 --> 02:00:49.150]
Find what's left of your innocence.

[02:00:49.710 --> 02:00:50.750]
Understand it.

[02:00:51.130 --> 02:00:51.850]
Embrace it.

[02:00:52.190 --> 02:00:52.890]
Protect it.

[02:00:53.170 --> 02:00:56.550]
And every so often, take it out for a nice nash.

[02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.710]
Carried off.

[02:00:58.930 --> 02:00:59.530]
Not to care.

[02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:01.070]
Home.

[02:01:01.450 --> 02:01:02.090]
While you eat.

[02:01:03.550 --> 02:01:04.150]
That's strange.

[02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:06.290]
And people will leave you alone.

[02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.990]
All right.

[02:01:07.630 --> 02:01:09.710]
Okay, 1248. Good words to live by.

[02:01:09.850 --> 02:01:11.750]
1248 at 560 WQM.

[02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:13.110]
The award winning the Oranger Show.

[02:01:13.210 --> 02:01:14.030]
We win awards from them.

[02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:14.870]
We win awards.

[02:01:15.050 --> 02:01:15.190]
No.

[02:01:15.330 --> 02:01:16.150]
Center Walmogat Awards.

[02:01:18.050 --> 02:01:20.010]
Let's put them up on the wall here and try to impress everybody.

[02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:21.710]
Then we can have their own Graceland.

[02:01:22.270 --> 02:01:25.170]
Maybe some of the lifeless assholes out there that are slumping up to Graceland.

[02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.990]
They'll come by here.

[02:01:26.110 --> 02:01:26.970]
Look up on the wall.

[02:01:27.090 --> 02:01:28.070]
All the awards, Neil God.

[02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:30.850]
We can go out in the parking lot and take a look inside his Corvette.

[02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:31.690]
There you go.

[02:01:32.770 --> 02:01:33.750]
Through the window, anyway.

[02:01:35.250 --> 02:01:36.210]
Here's a mobile invoker.

[02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.490]
Hello.

[02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.790]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:01:37.930 --> 02:01:38.270]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:38.630 --> 02:01:41.190]
I've been talking to you, what happened to your maple lamp, huh?

[02:01:41.890 --> 02:01:42.310]
Meaning what?

[02:01:52.690 --> 02:01:53.290]
I'm not sure.

[02:01:53.290 --> 02:01:53.290]

[02:01:53.290 --> 02:01:53.290]

Yeah, hold on.

[02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:40.390]
Okay, thank you.

[02:04:43.370 --> 02:04:45.290]
Okay, taking care of our fine friend there,

[02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:46.970]
Align 7, with Francis O'Hare.

[02:04:47.090 --> 02:04:47.390]
Oh!

[02:04:47.650 --> 02:04:49.290]
Boy, that old guy could drive a horse man.

[02:04:49.890 --> 02:04:51.150]
He had like a clock in his head.

[02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:52.750]
He was great.

[02:04:53.650 --> 02:04:55.810]
All these young punks to think they know something boy.

[02:04:55.870 --> 02:04:56.570]
He was around the day.

[02:04:56.610 --> 02:04:59.190]
If he would have been a young guy, he'd be a multi-millionaire.

[02:04:59.750 --> 02:05:01.050]
Well, he must have been doing okay because he used to

[02:05:01.050 --> 02:05:03.330]
have a big green Cadillac brand new one.

[02:05:04.050 --> 02:05:04.870]
Nice go on, Frankie.

[02:05:07.130 --> 02:05:10.010]
I mean, not that anybody cares, but one time I'm a Jackson Raceway.

[02:05:10.090 --> 02:05:12.310]
I mean, I'm not going to start like some other people on the station

[02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:14.030]
do like Eddie Kay and all the gambling stories.

[02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:16.430]
But I'm a Jackson Raceway and Jackson Machine,

[02:05:16.570 --> 02:05:17.610]
a little crappy harness track.

[02:05:18.910 --> 02:05:21.290]
And the eight horse was a horse named Millie R,

[02:05:21.450 --> 02:05:23.250]
which my mother's name is Millie, so obviously, you know,

[02:05:23.290 --> 02:05:25.770]
and it was a good horse and Francis O'Hare used to drive that horse.

[02:05:26.050 --> 02:05:28.510]
Well, his son, Daniel here, who couldn't drive his finger up his nose.

[02:05:28.650 --> 02:05:30.450]
In one of the words, he's driving a horse that night.

[02:05:31.630 --> 02:05:33.730]
And a horse is like four to one, five to one.

[02:05:33.970 --> 02:05:35.610]
All of a sudden, something must have happened

[02:05:35.610 --> 02:05:37.250]
and we must have got a bad bullet grits or something.

[02:05:37.590 --> 02:05:38.050]
And there's an announcement.

[02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:41.330]
Ladies and gentlemen, driver change number eight will be driven by Francis O'Hare.

[02:05:41.590 --> 02:05:43.150]
And everybody is running to the window.

[02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:44.530]
I go flying to the window.

[02:05:44.530 --> 02:05:46.070]
The horse goes off to make a long story short,

[02:05:46.110 --> 02:05:47.290]
even money wins by open links.

[02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:49.530]
Anybody care about that story?

[02:05:49.690 --> 02:05:49.830]
No.

[02:05:49.970 --> 02:05:50.350]
But I did.

[02:05:51.150 --> 02:05:51.690]
I did.

[02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:55.290]
There was a significant moment in my life back in the days when I used to

[02:05:55.290 --> 02:05:57.070]
cash a lot of tickets at the track in Michigan.

[02:05:58.570 --> 02:06:00.270]
So I gave away another pair of tickets, George,

[02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:01.770]
because the guy mentioned Francis O'Hare.

[02:06:01.770 --> 02:06:06.130]
5.670560, 0.560 on the mobile one line.

[02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:09.010]
Here's a mobile and girl spring.

[02:06:09.230 --> 02:06:09.310]
Hello?

[02:06:09.930 --> 02:06:10.330]
Neil.

[02:06:10.530 --> 02:06:10.850]
Yes, sir.

[02:06:10.970 --> 02:06:13.330]
I got a spy report on our favorite bank remat.

[02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:14.070]
Yeah.

[02:06:14.330 --> 02:06:14.510]
Yeah.

[02:06:14.730 --> 02:06:16.910]
He's going to be back in the banking business pretty soon.

[02:06:17.090 --> 02:06:17.490]
Pretty soon.

[02:06:17.570 --> 02:06:21.010]
Working out of the office to start his own bank up in Broward.

[02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:22.050]
And he'll be speaking to you.

[02:06:22.050 --> 02:06:23.550]
What do you mean, what do you mean, his own bank?

[02:06:23.850 --> 02:06:24.470]
His own bank.

[02:06:24.990 --> 02:06:25.910]
His starting his own bank.

[02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:28.590]
He's working out with the Fed's now to develop his own bank.

[02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:29.590]
How can he do that?

[02:06:30.010 --> 02:06:31.890]
Well, it gets enough investors together.

[02:06:32.410 --> 02:06:35.110]
And he can get enough capitalization to start making.

[02:06:35.290 --> 02:06:35.970]
What was it going to be?

[02:06:36.290 --> 02:06:37.510]
It's going to be in our community.

[02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:38.670]
I'm not sure where he had.

[02:06:38.950 --> 02:06:40.110]
It'll be opening this fall.

[02:06:40.370 --> 02:06:40.550]
Really?

[02:06:40.690 --> 02:06:41.490]
That's what he's looking for.

[02:06:41.650 --> 02:06:41.950]
Excellent.

[02:06:42.130 --> 02:06:43.430]
Okay, I'm waiting for you, Matt.

[02:06:43.690 --> 02:06:44.070]
Okay, baby.

[02:06:44.290 --> 02:06:44.670]
Okay, thanks.

[02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:45.690]
I'm waiting for you, Matt.

[02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:46.630]
Matt, of course, you're off great.

[02:06:46.970 --> 02:06:48.770]
Never stole a freight train.

[02:06:50.250 --> 02:06:51.310]
Always took great care of me.

[02:06:51.390 --> 02:06:51.910]
I'll tell you that.

[02:06:52.650 --> 02:06:55.830]
That was a real unsettling thing when I got that call on my

[02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:56.030]
phone.

[02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:57.270]
I was going to ask him to answer a machine that he was leaving my

[02:06:57.270 --> 02:07:01.110]
bank because I kind of felt like, you know, left in the wilderness.

[02:07:01.490 --> 02:07:02.950]
Yeah, like that.

[02:07:03.070 --> 02:07:04.810]
And of course, it's only your money, so why should you worry about

[02:07:04.810 --> 02:07:05.990]
something that insignificant, right?

[02:07:07.710 --> 02:07:08.570]
Well, that's very interesting.

[02:07:08.750 --> 02:07:10.870]
And glad that guy told me that because now I may just kind of like sit

[02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:12.070]
around and wait to see what happens.

[02:07:12.250 --> 02:07:15.770]
5.670560, £560 on a mobile one line.

[02:07:15.870 --> 02:07:16.670]
If you want some of those tickets.

[02:07:17.770 --> 02:07:18.090]
Huh?

[02:07:18.850 --> 02:07:20.750]
Maybe that guy went to school with Brad Cramer.

[02:07:20.890 --> 02:07:23.030]
Maybe he'll call it and maybe he'll get some tickets to the movie.

[02:07:25.410 --> 02:07:27.630]
Oh, yeah, we're going to talk about harness racing now that will be

[02:07:27.630 --> 02:07:28.310]
the end of this show.

[02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:29.970]
See, that's the thing about this town.

[02:07:30.170 --> 02:07:32.850]
They don't know anything about anything, things that are like everybody in their

[02:07:32.850 --> 02:07:35.370]
brother knows anyplace else in this country in North America.

[02:07:35.650 --> 02:07:36.510]
They know anything about it here.

[02:07:36.610 --> 02:07:37.850]
You don't even know what that it is.

[02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:39.190]
Oh, you mean those buggy horses?

[02:07:39.570 --> 02:07:39.990]
Is that it?

[02:07:40.190 --> 02:07:41.090]
Yeah, buggy horses.

[02:07:43.370 --> 02:07:44.270]
What does that say?

[02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:45.830]
Jackson Harness Race.

[02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:47.410]
Here's a mobile in Palm Beach.

[02:07:47.410 --> 02:07:47.690]
Hello.

[02:07:48.130 --> 02:07:48.350]
Hey.

[02:07:48.650 --> 02:07:48.990]
Yes, sir.

[02:07:49.490 --> 02:07:51.570]
I worked at Jackson Harness track.

[02:07:52.050 --> 02:07:52.470]
Oh, wow.

[02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:55.130]
I was going to college there at Jackson Junior College.

[02:07:55.250 --> 02:07:56.350]
I was on the basketball team.

[02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:57.090]
What year was that?

[02:07:57.650 --> 02:07:59.130]
So 63 and 64.

[02:07:59.510 --> 02:08:00.410]
Are you serious?

[02:08:00.590 --> 02:08:01.090]
I'm serious.

[02:08:01.450 --> 02:08:03.230]
Remember the cast in Eton Jackson?

[02:08:03.590 --> 02:08:06.370]
Was it, wasn't Leon Slaven with the president of the track then, right?

[02:08:06.710 --> 02:08:07.350]
Yeah, right.

[02:08:07.730 --> 02:08:09.730]
And I was, you know, just a young guy in college.

[02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:11.430]
I was like 18 years old.

[02:08:12.250 --> 02:08:14.130]
And I would take the tickets.

[02:08:14.330 --> 02:08:15.750]
And I said, I should have got a hot number tonight.

[02:08:16.010 --> 02:08:18.390]
I said, yeah, I said, pick four and a sixth race.

[02:08:19.190 --> 02:08:20.030]
I didn't do nothing.

[02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:22.510]
If you want the guy to come back, give me a 10 dollar bill.

[02:08:23.050 --> 02:08:23.250]
Really?

[02:08:23.390 --> 02:08:26.050]
I was just putting the numbers out just to be putting them out.

[02:08:27.170 --> 02:08:29.410]
So a great time over there, though.

[02:08:29.630 --> 02:08:30.310]
I was great.

[02:08:31.550 --> 02:08:34.110]
And that track, I remember you could put $100 to win on a horse

[02:08:34.110 --> 02:08:36.150]
and change the odds from $7 to $1, like $3 to $5.

[02:08:36.450 --> 02:08:37.290]
You could watch the world match.

[02:08:37.590 --> 02:08:38.150]
It was great.

[02:08:38.730 --> 02:08:40.910]
In fact, a lot of times you could watch the warmups in a horse

[02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:41.970]
that could still stand up.

[02:08:42.070 --> 02:08:43.130]
Those are the ones you knew were going to win.

[02:08:43.610 --> 02:08:44.610]
It was done there.

[02:08:45.230 --> 02:08:47.030]
There was a big attraction there, though.

[02:08:47.110 --> 02:08:47.670]
It's your one.

[02:08:47.850 --> 02:08:48.950]
You had nothing else going on there.

[02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:51.090]
That attraction stayed prison, those were the two big deals.

[02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:51.290]

[02:08:51.470 --> 02:08:53.050]
Now, if some of those drivers wound up there.

[02:08:54.270 --> 02:08:57.310]
I used to go because I was on a basketball team.

[02:08:57.390 --> 02:08:59.590]
So we could go play the prisoners over there.

[02:09:00.570 --> 02:09:02.950]
And again, being running my eat back in the 60s.

[02:09:04.010 --> 02:09:06.610]
So that is what the paintings guide with the robes

[02:09:06.610 --> 02:09:07.910]
during closing everything else, right?

[02:09:08.490 --> 02:09:10.590]
That means that those guys want to go shower, go shower.

[02:09:10.750 --> 02:09:13.150]
Well, I'm worth thinking that I have little shower stalls, right?

[02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.590]
Yeah.

[02:09:13.590 --> 02:09:18.630]
We have a run-and-roll that has about 45 novels

[02:09:18.630 --> 02:09:20.470]
that you just all stand there.

[02:09:20.530 --> 02:09:21.910]
Yeah, kind of like the dolphins, right?

[02:09:23.190 --> 02:09:25.870]
We've got all the prisoners looking at all these young guys

[02:09:25.870 --> 02:09:27.090]
who are the drivers shower.

[02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:27.650]
Yeah.

[02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:29.730]
So I thought that was a good shower,

[02:09:29.930 --> 02:09:31.290]
but back to the building.

[02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:32.210]
Good thinking, man.

[02:09:32.330 --> 02:09:33.270]
Take it from somebody who knows.

[02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:34.610]
Stay out of the bathhouses, man.

[02:09:34.990 --> 02:09:36.890]
You mentioned the objection list.

[02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:38.930]
I had to try to return it, and I used to work there.

[02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:39.430]
How's that?

[02:09:39.530 --> 02:09:40.210]
Good hearing from you.

[02:09:40.450 --> 02:09:41.130]
Okay, take care.

[02:09:41.590 --> 02:09:41.990]
All right.

[02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.570]
There you go.

[02:09:43.630 --> 02:09:44.690]
Jackson, Rex Putnam.

[02:09:46.690 --> 02:09:47.330]
Now we're talking.

[02:09:47.850 --> 02:09:51.650]
Dwayne Dilworth, Clemonds A.O.T., Gerald Benfield.

[02:09:51.870 --> 02:09:52.770]
All those glam, man.

[02:09:53.670 --> 02:09:58.030]
Tommy Harmer, 5.670560, Pond 560 on a mobile one line.

[02:09:58.150 --> 02:09:59.850]
That's what I'm going to do tomorrow, by the way, for a couple hours.

[02:09:59.970 --> 02:10:02.570]
I'm just going to flip off a bunch of harness racing names.

[02:10:02.910 --> 02:10:03.690]
Get us down to a zero.

[02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:04.970]
Huh?

[02:10:05.190 --> 02:10:07.690]
And then Monday, what I'll do is hockey players all for four hours.

[02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:08.790]
Just name all the hockey players.

[02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:09.930]
There you go.

[02:10:10.010 --> 02:10:11.430]
There's Bobby Bond on the Broken Echo.

[02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.910]
Look at that.

[02:10:11.950 --> 02:10:12.790]
He's stuck right in there.

[02:10:12.850 --> 02:10:13.210]
Nice going.

[02:10:14.910 --> 02:10:16.910]
Anyway, you know, you got to learn new things.

[02:10:17.010 --> 02:10:19.850]
You people are sitting out there with your finger and your nose pulling the limp here out.

[02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:21.750]
Three minutes before a water keyway in.

[02:10:21.930 --> 02:10:22.770]
Oh, boy.

[02:10:23.130 --> 02:10:24.650]
It's the one to two hours.

[02:10:27.790 --> 02:10:28.190]
Oh.

[02:10:36.150 --> 02:10:41.410]
When the fog gets blown over every USHM, races are still just like that.

[02:10:41.410 --> 02:10:42.350]
Yeah.

[02:10:48.530 --> 02:10:49.210]
Welcome.

[02:10:49.790 --> 02:10:49.890]
Good.

[02:10:50.090 --> 02:10:51.750]
Let's start the game.

[02:10:53.110 --> 02:10:55.410]
There's secret to get things.

[02:10:55.990 --> 02:10:57.190]
We all are so excited.

[02:10:57.890 --> 02:11:00.850]
Well, you're talking about time out of the show.

[02:11:01.050 --> 02:11:02.670]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

[02:11:02.930 --> 02:11:03.610]
Wow.

[02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:04.950]
Time to go.

[02:11:11.410 --> 02:11:17.710]
Here's campaign was brought up by the commies and trained for the French and they subdued.

[02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:20.850]
The British was not the never-ending ones wrong.

[02:11:21.450 --> 02:11:24.410]
He's been a careerist and went on side.

[02:11:27.610 --> 02:11:30.810]
No, and not safe from the red, I be safe.

[02:11:31.470 --> 02:11:33.370]
You know, these are kids.

[02:11:34.670 --> 02:11:37.410]
Hail to the coward in chief.

[02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:41.010]
Oh, right.

[02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:42.550]
We're here for the anthem.

[02:11:43.330 --> 02:11:44.490]
Oh, yeah.

[02:11:45.030 --> 02:11:48.070]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:51.490]
That means I can't have done.

[02:11:52.290 --> 02:11:52.450]
Whoa.

[02:11:54.350 --> 02:11:54.910]
Wow.

[02:11:55.210 --> 02:11:56.330]
Time to go.

[02:11:59.170 --> 02:12:01.430]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:12:06.610 --> 02:12:08.190]
104-560-2QM.

[02:12:08.290 --> 02:12:13.390]
So anyway, our vote for the best actor in the year is of the century is not getting no calls on that.

[02:12:13.490 --> 02:12:13.610]
Good.

[02:12:13.790 --> 02:12:14.090]
That's cool.

[02:12:14.170 --> 02:12:14.810]
We'll say that for tomorrow.

[02:12:15.790 --> 02:12:19.630]
5667-0560-560 on the AT&T wireless line of hand goldberg show at 2.

[02:12:20.030 --> 02:12:21.230]
Josh Darrow, 6 o'clock.

[02:12:21.310 --> 02:12:22.070]
He's a sleeper, baby.

[02:12:22.510 --> 02:12:23.130]
6 to 8.

[02:12:23.370 --> 02:12:24.050]
He's a sleeper.

[02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:25.030]
You listen for a few minutes.

[02:12:25.110 --> 02:12:25.650]
You'll be sleeping.

[02:12:26.170 --> 02:12:26.890]
Now he's going to be fine.

[02:12:27.490 --> 02:12:28.010]
Here's Miami.

[02:12:28.210 --> 02:12:28.370]
Hello.

[02:12:30.230 --> 02:12:32.750]
Miami, thank you very nice talking to you and have a great day.

[02:12:33.290 --> 02:12:35.450]
And I was just about to give them tickets to how do you like that?

[02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:37.090]
Here's the Hollywood.

[02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:37.410]
Hello.

[02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:44.690]
5667-0560-560 on the AT&T wireless line as we get a hit just keep on coming, baby.

[02:12:44.750 --> 02:12:45.410]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:12:46.570 --> 02:12:48.070]
Yeah, with a yes in front of it.

[02:12:49.590 --> 02:12:50.950]
Let's try a plantation.

[02:12:51.210 --> 02:12:51.390]
Hello.

[02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.910]
Hello.

[02:12:54.150 --> 02:12:54.490]
Yes, sir.

[02:12:55.090 --> 02:12:57.010]
Yeah, can I hear that?

[02:12:57.590 --> 02:12:58.370]
That's flying.

[02:12:59.490 --> 02:12:59.910]
That's flying?

[02:13:00.530 --> 02:13:00.930]
What is it?

[02:13:01.470 --> 02:13:03.090]
Yeah, that's sticking to my ass song.

[02:13:03.930 --> 02:13:05.350]
Stick it in my ass song?

[02:13:05.790 --> 02:13:06.130]
Yeah.

[02:13:06.910 --> 02:13:07.990]
What's all song is that?

[02:13:08.490 --> 02:13:09.850]
I don't know, you guys played all the time.

[02:13:12.570 --> 02:13:13.670]
How does it go?

[02:13:14.630 --> 02:13:18.650]
I don't know, it's got some woman saying no, just sticking to my ass and this man.

[02:13:19.090 --> 02:13:19.930]
Okay, we'll look for it.

[02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:20.170]
Okay.

[02:13:21.130 --> 02:13:22.570]
Anybody know stick it in your ass?

[02:13:22.570 --> 02:13:23.190]
Okay.

[02:13:25.690 --> 02:13:28.410]
5667-0560-560.

[02:13:28.850 --> 02:13:29.530]
What is it?

[02:13:29.530 --> 02:13:31.550]
He's talking about ERECTT island.

[02:13:32.090 --> 02:13:32.510]
Oh!

[02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:34.790]
Oh, you mean...

[02:13:35.890 --> 02:13:37.190]
ERECTT island!

[02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:40.550]
It's the rectum time!

[02:13:41.070 --> 02:13:44.330]
I'm gonna kick off my shoes, strip off my dress.

[02:13:44.730 --> 02:13:44.990]
Oh!

[02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:48.150]
It makes me wet when I see you, can't.

[02:13:48.170 --> 02:13:48.590]
Oh, right.

[02:13:48.890 --> 02:13:51.330]
A big, erectum.

[02:13:51.710 --> 02:13:52.510]
That's good.

[02:13:52.510 --> 02:13:54.510]
Yeah.

[02:14:22.510 --> 02:14:22.990]
What's work?

[02:14:22.990 --> 02:14:23.530]
That's the morning in kids.

[02:14:24.230 --> 02:14:25.370]
And big, and stiff.

[02:14:26.130 --> 02:14:30.830]
And dreams come until you take up his own water rep on his surrounds.

[02:14:31.230 --> 02:14:32.430]
You're clothing too.

[02:14:33.050 --> 02:14:35.670]
And make your wonderworm explode with clothes.

[02:14:36.010 --> 02:14:36.510]
What's work?

[02:14:36.770 --> 02:14:38.510]
That's the clock we're at.

[02:14:39.650 --> 02:14:41.630]
And his son, Sir Cup 5.

[02:14:42.070 --> 02:14:42.270]
Oh!

[02:14:43.150 --> 02:14:46.390]
E-R-E-T-D-I-O-H-S.

[02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:48.610]
I want to drink your balls.

[02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:52.770]
E-R-E-T-D-I-O-H.

[02:14:53.190 --> 02:14:53.190]

[02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:54.770]
Okay, it's almost six.

[02:14:54.890 --> 02:14:55.810]
I think that's what he wanted.

[02:14:55.950 --> 02:14:56.090]
No.

[02:14:56.230 --> 02:14:56.690]
I think it was.

[02:14:58.470 --> 02:15:01.870]
5.670560, 0.560 on the 18th at P wireless line.

[02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.850]
June 17th.

[02:15:02.850 --> 02:15:03.210]
Not bad.

[02:15:03.330 --> 02:15:04.110]
I'll be honest with you.

[02:15:04.890 --> 02:15:05.530]
Not bad.

[02:15:05.650 --> 02:15:07.370]
May and June this year compared to last year.

[02:15:07.450 --> 02:15:08.550]
Boy, that was a death now.

[02:15:08.670 --> 02:15:09.770]
That was like the end of the world.

[02:15:11.930 --> 02:15:12.690]
Here's West Miami.

[02:15:12.730 --> 02:15:13.050]
Hello.

[02:15:13.890 --> 02:15:14.190]
No.

[02:15:14.410 --> 02:15:14.730]
Yes, Sir.

[02:15:14.850 --> 02:15:15.550]
I know you can give the city.

[02:15:15.550 --> 02:15:16.050]
Okay, great.

[02:15:17.490 --> 02:15:17.850]
Chronic.

[02:15:18.090 --> 02:15:19.950]
I mean real chronic.

[02:15:20.170 --> 02:15:22.030]
Sir, you're going to have to go get yourself like a voice

[02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:23.410]
to a box transplant or something.

[02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:24.770]
Because you're so obvious.

[02:15:25.110 --> 02:15:27.090]
I mean, talk about telescoping it with that voice.

[02:15:27.230 --> 02:15:27.650]
That sound.

[02:15:28.490 --> 02:15:28.750]
Wow.

[02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:30.110]
I did like the guy before said.

[02:15:30.410 --> 02:15:31.330]
Get out of the way out.

[02:15:31.450 --> 02:15:33.010]
And I second that emotion in your case.

[02:15:33.770 --> 02:15:34.670]
Get your life pal.

[02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:37.190]
Get you like a buddy, a little rubber inflatable buddy.

[02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:39.930]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:15:40.070 --> 02:15:40.270]
Hello.

[02:15:41.030 --> 02:15:41.590]
Hello, Neil.

[02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:42.090]
Yes, Sir.

[02:15:42.670 --> 02:15:42.870]
Hi.

[02:15:42.970 --> 02:15:44.470]
This is our first time caller, longtime listener.

[02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:45.050]
Uh-huh.

[02:15:45.890 --> 02:15:46.970]
I don't really have any material.

[02:15:47.110 --> 02:15:48.290]
I just went back and talked about Texas.

[02:15:48.570 --> 02:15:49.770]
But I look at it and I miss you.

[02:15:50.170 --> 02:15:50.930]
I really enjoy your show.

[02:15:51.070 --> 02:15:53.050]
I heard you on the web a couple times up there.

[02:15:53.290 --> 02:15:53.450]
Great.

[02:15:54.070 --> 02:15:54.850]
That was a meal I get.

[02:15:55.710 --> 02:15:57.030]
I am just a single Julio.

[02:15:57.150 --> 02:15:58.230]
But I really like to have the tickets.

[02:15:58.230 --> 02:15:59.170]
So that's okay with you.

[02:15:59.630 --> 02:16:00.670]
You just came back to town?

[02:16:01.150 --> 02:16:01.510]
Yes, Sir.

[02:16:01.650 --> 02:16:03.150]
Well, wait till you're here a little bit longer.

[02:16:03.310 --> 02:16:04.210]
Okay, then start free loading.

[02:16:04.370 --> 02:16:06.490]
Okay, don't just come back from Texas and start free loading.

[02:16:07.610 --> 02:16:08.410]
Practice a little while.

[02:16:08.570 --> 02:16:09.990]
Okay, and then we'll maybe give you something for free.

[02:16:10.030 --> 02:16:11.230]
I doubt it, but we'll work on it.

[02:16:13.530 --> 02:16:13.850]
Boy.

[02:16:13.850 --> 02:16:16.890]
I sure played my cards right today, you know?

[02:16:17.130 --> 02:16:17.930]
Yes, I did.

[02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:19.830]
Sure played this thing exactly right.

[02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:21.790]
If I would have done that thing like right down the middle,

[02:16:22.110 --> 02:16:23.250]
like somebody suggested George.

[02:16:24.250 --> 02:16:26.750]
No, I know you didn't suggest, but you thought that I would.

[02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:27.270]
You really did.

[02:16:27.330 --> 02:16:28.990]
You got all those labels out and you thought that,

[02:16:29.050 --> 02:16:32.190]
oh yeah, it'll be an easy way for the old man to, you know, buy a show and, you know,

[02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:33.050]
I don't do that.

[02:16:33.090 --> 02:16:36.170]
I want to have to go scrambling at the last minute if he decided to.

[02:16:36.570 --> 02:16:36.930]
I like people.

[02:16:37.130 --> 02:16:37.730]
Don't get defensive.

[02:16:37.850 --> 02:16:39.130]
You must be catching it from him.

[02:16:39.290 --> 02:16:41.030]
Okay, don't, you don't have to be defensive in there.

[02:16:41.390 --> 02:16:42.850]
You know how easy going I am.

[02:16:42.850 --> 02:16:45.350]
I'm not the one that's always bitching out the hired hands in the other room.

[02:16:45.450 --> 02:16:46.650]
I'll leave that to somebody else.

[02:16:48.250 --> 02:16:49.890]
I mean, I'm like I said the other day.

[02:16:50.030 --> 02:16:52.270]
I'm not, I'm holding nothing back anymore, you know?

[02:16:52.310 --> 02:16:55.030]
I mean, in this place, I see where all the cards are laying.

[02:16:55.290 --> 02:16:56.210]
I'm not holding anything back.

[02:16:57.290 --> 02:16:58.230]
And what's the point?

[02:16:59.390 --> 02:17:00.390]
Let's be brutally honest.

[02:17:00.530 --> 02:17:02.790]
If we're going to have some people in here want to play a hard ball,

[02:17:02.970 --> 02:17:06.470]
a good like Joe Dajola used to say, good old country hard ball, you know,

[02:17:06.530 --> 02:17:09.550]
a literate Joe Dajola, who made millions by being illiterate.

[02:17:09.730 --> 02:17:11.310]
Only in America can you make that much money,

[02:17:11.310 --> 02:17:12.990]
being like almost totally illiterate.

[02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:14.110]
Nice going there, Dajola.

[02:17:14.690 --> 02:17:15.990]
Good old country hard ball.

[02:17:16.050 --> 02:17:16.650]
He got him.

[02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.810]
He got him.

[02:17:17.970 --> 02:17:18.530]
At a boy Joe.

[02:17:20.710 --> 02:17:23.690]
Oh, I'd rather listen to Bob Costas than Joe Dajola.

[02:17:23.690 --> 02:17:25.410]
I'd rather be dead than here Bob Costas.

[02:17:25.510 --> 02:17:28.670]
I was a channel surfing last night and it was almost the end of the basketball game.

[02:17:29.130 --> 02:17:30.870]
And San Antonio was like pulling away from the mix.

[02:17:31.130 --> 02:17:34.910]
Now, I watched about two minutes of it until I realized that it was Bob Costas doing the game in assembly.

[02:17:35.290 --> 02:17:36.910]
I had to go run to the room.

[02:17:37.110 --> 02:17:39.270]
Oh boy, talk about Twerp, little Twerp,

[02:17:39.270 --> 02:17:41.910]
little arrogant Twerp who is nothing.

[02:17:42.550 --> 02:17:42.990]
Nothing.

[02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:46.150]
There is nothing about him other than he's a little ass-sucking Twerp.

[02:17:48.050 --> 02:17:50.930]
Nine minutes after one in 560 WQM, you heard me.

[02:17:51.150 --> 02:17:51.450]
Oh God!

[02:17:56.370 --> 02:17:56.890]
Roy!

[02:17:57.350 --> 02:17:58.030]
Come on everybody.

[02:17:58.630 --> 02:17:59.550]
Don't look here man.

[02:18:00.050 --> 02:18:01.130]
We gonna play again.

[02:18:02.370 --> 02:18:04.170]
We be snippets there, right?

[02:18:04.630 --> 02:18:05.390]
We be snippets there.

[02:18:05.610 --> 02:18:06.910]
And he's finally to be busy.

[02:18:07.950 --> 02:18:10.050]
You think the bucket's all for it?

[02:18:10.050 --> 02:18:12.750]
I think the bucket's still to be good.

[02:18:14.130 --> 02:18:15.610]
Check out what I've been thinking.

[02:18:17.010 --> 02:18:18.450]
You haven't found a tooltask.

[02:18:19.690 --> 02:18:20.010]
Oh!

[02:18:20.010 --> 02:18:20.010]

[02:18:20.450 --> 02:18:20.710]
Jesus!

[02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:21.010]
Jesus!

[02:18:21.590 --> 02:18:21.590]

[02:18:24.330 --> 02:18:24.670]

[02:18:24.970 --> 02:18:25.290]
Oh!

[02:18:25.590 --> 02:18:25.890]
Jesus!

[02:18:27.170 --> 02:18:28.690]
Let me do homies.

[02:18:29.090 --> 02:18:29.330]

[02:18:29.570 --> 02:18:29.730]

[02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.270]

[02:18:33.710 --> 02:18:34.790]

[02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:35.950]
Homies!

[02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:47.010]

[02:18:47.310 --> 02:18:47.610]
Homies!

[02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:50.510]
Homies!

[02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:54.510]
You be voted!

[02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:55.290]

[02:18:55.290 --> 02:18:55.690]
Homies!

[02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:56.210]
Homies!

[02:18:56.350 --> 02:18:56.470]

[02:18:59.890 --> 02:19:00.650]

[02:19:04.410 --> 02:19:05.110]

[02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:08.050]
Homies!

[02:19:08.050 --> 02:19:08.050]

[02:19:11.250 --> 02:19:13.950]
This is our B-Ensidan!

[02:19:17.610 --> 02:19:19.670]
This is our B-Ensidan.

[02:19:27.970 --> 02:19:31.970]
16 to 560 WDQM, under Panknozi at the Jula Rosa's departed.

[02:19:32.830 --> 02:19:35.970]
16 open lines, all of a sudden right now, was during the playing of that for some reason

[02:19:35.970 --> 02:19:38.270]
that they were enraging their... just dropped it.

[02:19:38.370 --> 02:19:42.050]
560, 705, 60, pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[02:19:42.410 --> 02:19:43.830]
Here's the mobile or West Palm Beach. Hello.

[02:19:44.710 --> 02:19:45.210]
Hello, Neil.

[02:19:45.410 --> 02:19:45.670]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:46.210 --> 02:19:49.210]
Yeah, I like to talk to you about Jim Brown thing with the white women.

[02:19:49.370 --> 02:19:49.510]
Yes.

[02:19:49.850 --> 02:19:50.950]
Is he with the regular white chick?

[02:19:51.770 --> 02:19:52.470]
I don't know.

[02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:53.150]
Oh.

[02:19:53.350 --> 02:19:58.570]
I just like to talk to you about why the black athletes prefer white women instead of black women.

[02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:59.130]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:59.570 --> 02:20:03.910]
The reason is that the black men, when they get the money, they're weak.

[02:20:04.390 --> 02:20:08.370]
They get it, they get it, they get it, the black women, because they think the black women are going to take money from.

[02:20:08.750 --> 02:20:08.930]
Yeah.

[02:20:09.470 --> 02:20:11.090]
So they go to the white women instead.

[02:20:11.410 --> 02:20:11.690]
Uh-huh.

[02:20:12.650 --> 02:20:13.370]
That's about it.

[02:20:14.170 --> 02:20:15.350]
Okay, well thanks for the good news.

[02:20:15.490 --> 02:20:15.750]
There you go.

[02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:18.050]
All your black jocks out there, stick with the white chicks, okay?

[02:20:18.050 --> 02:20:21.210]
They want to each out of house and home or whatever we said.

[02:20:21.690 --> 02:20:23.510]
Fine, they won't each out of house and home.

[02:20:23.850 --> 02:20:28.610]
5667 05 60 pound 560 on the, so anyway speaking of that, speaking of Roy.

[02:20:29.470 --> 02:20:34.230]
He did bring back, for those who have been following the saga of the missing large black rubber dildo that we had in here.

[02:20:35.690 --> 02:20:37.490]
Which are good post personal, buddy.

[02:20:37.550 --> 02:20:37.850]
Roy.

[02:20:38.090 --> 02:20:38.870]
From our sales department.

[02:20:39.090 --> 02:20:40.330]
I wouldn't want to say like a sales hole.

[02:20:40.470 --> 02:20:41.870]
He is from our sales department, you know.

[02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:42.230]
Roy.

[02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:43.670]
Not in it, just from it.

[02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:47.310]
But anyway, he kind of like appropriated this last Thursday or Friday.

[02:20:47.450 --> 02:20:50.690]
He came storming in here, saw this sitting up on the leg and said, I got it.

[02:20:50.830 --> 02:20:51.290]
I got it.

[02:20:51.290 --> 02:20:51.390]
I got it.

[02:20:51.470 --> 02:20:52.490]
And he ran out of here with it.

[02:20:52.690 --> 02:20:53.430]
Somebody in Coherently.

[02:20:53.810 --> 02:20:57.910]
Yes, today like right in the middle of the show, also somebody in Coherently came running back in here.

[02:20:58.810 --> 02:21:01.490]
And plopped it right back up in a spot right up there running a thing.

[02:21:02.390 --> 02:21:05.730]
Of course, before very long, as soon as he got out of the room, I ran up there in the grab.

[02:21:05.730 --> 02:21:09.870]
It's to take a look at it and I'll, I'll leak at it to make sure that it hadn't been abused and show enough.

[02:21:10.190 --> 02:21:11.070]
It had been abused.

[02:21:11.070 --> 02:21:16.550]
Oh, yeah, this was a perfectly pristine, large black penis just taking right out of the box.

[02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:17.970]
I forget who sent this to us.

[02:21:18.370 --> 02:21:19.870]
Do you remember who?

[02:21:24.750 --> 02:21:25.570]
What is he saying?

[02:21:26.450 --> 02:21:27.850]
We're not saying who sent it to us?

[02:21:28.110 --> 02:21:28.870]
No, we're not saying who.

[02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:30.550]
Oh, that person sent it to us.

[02:21:30.750 --> 02:21:31.350]
Well, we're not saying.

[02:21:32.030 --> 02:21:37.690]
But nevertheless, we were very proud of this and it was quite a conversation piece around the studio here, all around the building.

[02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:41.410]
And now it was like pristine.

[02:21:41.590 --> 02:21:42.330]
It was like brand new.

[02:21:42.370 --> 02:21:42.830]
It was shiny.

[02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.730]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.150]
Shiny.

[02:21:44.290 --> 02:21:45.770]
It was a nice big black shiny penis.

[02:21:46.170 --> 02:21:50.610]
Now, unfortunately, on the head, it's been, you can see all the warehouse spots.

[02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:53.970]
You've heard that expression, none the worse for wear.

[02:21:54.110 --> 02:21:55.370]
Well, this is the worse for wear.

[02:21:56.370 --> 02:21:57.210]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:21:57.410 --> 02:21:57.730]
Roy!

[02:21:58.430 --> 02:22:02.890]
So the investigation continues to find out exactly to whom and where in and to what that was done.

[02:22:03.490 --> 02:22:04.110]
Nice going Roy.

[02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:07.670]
I've had only somebody had a real good time with that over the weekend.

[02:22:08.250 --> 02:22:09.110]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.330]
Hello.

[02:22:10.330 --> 02:22:11.230]
Hey, Neu, how you doing?

[02:22:11.410 --> 02:22:11.610]
Great.

[02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:14.450]
I was wondering if you ever read the book The Godfather?

[02:22:14.850 --> 02:22:15.030]
Yes.

[02:22:15.410 --> 02:22:16.370]
Booking better than the movie.

[02:22:16.610 --> 02:22:16.610]

[02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:18.390]
I just got a hold of it and just finished it.

[02:22:18.490 --> 02:22:20.070]
It's so much better than the movie, right?

[02:22:20.290 --> 02:22:20.470]
Yes.

[02:22:20.730 --> 02:22:23.190]
As good as the movie was and it's my favorite but nevertheless,

[02:22:23.410 --> 02:22:25.930]
or next to network, it's my favorite but the book was much better.

[02:22:26.090 --> 02:22:26.390]
Oh, yes.

[02:22:26.530 --> 02:22:29.370]
Especially when they get into the scenes about, you know, the doctor and all that.

[02:22:29.430 --> 02:22:29.890]
That was phenomenal.

[02:22:30.010 --> 02:22:33.550]
See, see a lot of people, they think, wow, you know, pseudo intellectuals say stuff like that.

[02:22:33.550 --> 02:22:35.290]
You know, the book is always, and I don't believe that.

[02:22:35.410 --> 02:22:37.050]
Sometimes the book is better, sometimes it's not.

[02:22:37.370 --> 02:22:40.430]
But in this particular case, if you like The Godfather, it's worth reading the book.

[02:22:40.750 --> 02:22:40.890]
Right.

[02:22:41.350 --> 02:22:42.890]
Two things. One, I was hoping to take it.

[02:22:43.010 --> 02:22:44.530]
But two, also, I have another request.

[02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:49.150]
The Aikman song, because in today's USA Today, they printed his salary for last year.

[02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:49.450]
Yeah.

[02:22:49.650 --> 02:22:54.670]
And I need to feel better about myself after seeing this guy make five, five, five, one thousand.

[02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:58.170]
Okay, I think your little snowball is what it is.

[02:22:58.750 --> 02:23:02.470]
Well, highball, yeah, I understand after I have one or two high balls, so really, it's wild.

[02:23:02.470 --> 02:23:03.070]
I want to find her.

[02:23:03.330 --> 02:23:05.610]
When the squad aback, it's lonely.

[02:23:06.830 --> 02:23:07.310]
Yeah.

[02:23:07.930 --> 02:23:10.170]
He likes receivers better, why?

[02:23:11.130 --> 02:23:11.670]
Oh, right.

[02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:16.710]
Some people say that number ages gay.

[02:23:16.930 --> 02:23:17.170]
Yeah.

[02:23:17.650 --> 02:23:20.470]
They say Troy loves the big brown eyes.

[02:23:21.890 --> 02:23:22.730]
Aikman.

[02:23:24.770 --> 02:23:27.770]
You go down on his knees, Aikman.

[02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:28.990]
Yeah.

[02:23:42.890 --> 02:23:46.010]
He's got a sparkless reputation.

[02:23:48.650 --> 02:23:50.730]
America's team has world renowned.

[02:23:53.090 --> 02:23:54.830]
But is Troy gay?

[02:23:55.290 --> 02:23:58.310]
I've heard some people say boy.

[02:23:58.650 --> 02:23:58.970]
He's got a sparkless reputation.

[02:23:58.970 --> 02:23:58.970]

[02:23:58.970 --> 02:23:58.970]

[02:23:58.970 --> 02:23:58.970]

[02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:04.390]
Aikman.

[02:24:05.210 --> 02:24:06.050]
He goes down Aikman.

[02:24:06.050 --> 02:24:08.350]
He goes down on his knees, Aikman.

[02:24:09.070 --> 02:24:09.410]
Okay.

[02:24:10.430 --> 02:24:13.390]
I can't some balls to squeeze Aikman.

[02:24:15.250 --> 02:24:21.250]
Don't lift him, cause he likes it from behind.

[02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:24.070]
Back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back.

[02:24:24.070 --> 02:24:24.830]
Okay, well, calm down.

[02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:28.710]
On 121-560 WQM, would it be something all those macho athletes?

[02:24:28.930 --> 02:24:29.670]
Of course they all know.

[02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:33.890]
But the fans, especially like some of those jocks, the first of the call is radio station.

[02:24:34.090 --> 02:24:36.770]
You know, the other 20 hours a day, or pretending to be a sports station.

[02:24:37.130 --> 02:24:38.410]
Those people really would be crushed.

[02:24:38.610 --> 02:24:42.350]
You know, if they had like that long, long list of all those fags running around in the locker room,

[02:24:42.490 --> 02:24:43.270]
showering with the other guys.

[02:24:43.650 --> 02:24:44.290]
Oh, man.

[02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:45.970]
They would, they'd never be the same again.

[02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:51.150]
Oh, that's just a Roman, that's just, you know, I'll have Steve Young and Troy Aikman stuff.

[02:24:51.470 --> 02:24:51.670]
Yeah.

[02:24:51.790 --> 02:24:53.570]
And even if it is, that's only two, you know.

[02:24:53.570 --> 02:24:54.130]
Yeah.

[02:24:55.050 --> 02:24:56.750]
That's only two of the top quarterbacks in league.

[02:24:56.810 --> 02:24:57.850]
Now let's get to the other positions.

[02:24:58.030 --> 02:24:58.350]
Oh, sorry.

[02:24:59.890 --> 02:25:00.490]
Here's Miami.

[02:25:00.490 --> 02:25:00.770]
Hello.

[02:25:01.410 --> 02:25:01.850]
Yeah, hi.

[02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:02.350]
Yes, sir.

[02:25:02.650 --> 02:25:03.710]
I haven't spoken to you today.

[02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:06.110]
You hung up before because I was on speaker.

[02:25:06.410 --> 02:25:09.010]
And it's like, when you hear that clicky, you thought I was hanging out with you.

[02:25:09.010 --> 02:25:09.290]
Okay.

[02:25:09.690 --> 02:25:09.830]
Okay.

[02:25:09.970 --> 02:25:10.230]
Anyway, sorry.

[02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:10.870]
Okay.

[02:25:11.130 --> 02:25:15.070]
I read in an article actually, they were selling a watch.

[02:25:15.610 --> 02:25:17.330]
Just changing the subject a little bit.

[02:25:17.810 --> 02:25:19.450]
The watch was for a millennium clock.

[02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:21.510]
And you can set it to the year 2000.

[02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:27.210]
And then at the bottom it says, even though the millennium starts 2001, the watch can work for 2000.

[02:25:27.350 --> 02:25:27.790]
Wait a minute.

[02:25:28.050 --> 02:25:28.310]
Wait a minute.

[02:25:28.590 --> 02:25:29.410]
What, what is that smoke?

[02:25:32.210 --> 02:25:33.050]
That would be intense.

[02:25:33.890 --> 02:25:34.550]
Oh, okay.

[02:25:34.590 --> 02:25:34.870]
Go ahead.

[02:25:35.050 --> 02:25:35.990]
God, I went into a panic.

[02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:37.810]
I thought the guy named Studio was on fire there.

[02:25:37.890 --> 02:25:38.230]
Yes, sir.

[02:25:38.590 --> 02:25:39.350]
Well, that's about it.

[02:25:39.550 --> 02:25:39.910]
Okay.

[02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:40.610]
Thanks for the good news.

[02:25:40.830 --> 02:25:44.190]
I mean, he said something about the millennium clock and I wasn't paying attention because I was a little distracted.

[02:25:44.530 --> 02:25:45.770]
We're not allowed to smoke in here.

[02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.990]
And it's not smoke.

[02:25:47.090 --> 02:25:47.590]
It's incense.

[02:25:48.090 --> 02:25:48.550]
And peppermint.

[02:25:48.670 --> 02:25:51.110]
That's probably to cover up, you know, the smell of the bad stuff.

[02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.710]
Come on.

[02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:55.330]
Well, you know, we happen to be in the neighborhood and Chuck is bringing over the lunch every now and then.

[02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:58.030]
So, as long as you didn't hoodline up, bring over some good stuff with it.

[02:25:58.090 --> 02:25:58.570]
Come on.

[02:25:59.570 --> 02:26:03.110]
I think right between Jiffy Loub and the tariff change over there, whatever that place is.

[02:26:03.230 --> 02:26:03.590]
Tar kingdom.

[02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:08.810]
I think if you sneak like right in the back there between is where you find the real food you're making stuff.

[02:26:09.210 --> 02:26:12.090]
I think that's where they go back there and kind of like jerk pork and jerk chicken.

[02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:15.690]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pond 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[02:26:16.090 --> 02:26:16.910]
Here's four lotterdale.

[02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:17.170]
Hello.

[02:26:17.850 --> 02:26:18.310]
Hey, Neil.

[02:26:18.470 --> 02:26:18.810]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:18.810 --> 02:26:19.530]
What's going on, dude?

[02:26:20.290 --> 02:26:21.350]
Hey, check it out.

[02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:23.150]
And I, I, I, I, did you say check it out?

[02:26:23.430 --> 02:26:24.150]
Check it, yeah.

[02:26:24.390 --> 02:26:24.650]
Okay.

[02:26:25.050 --> 02:26:26.230]
And, and the book, too.

[02:26:26.490 --> 02:26:26.790]
All right.

[02:26:27.090 --> 02:26:31.070]
Hey, the hunt for red October, I read the book a long time before I saw the movie.

[02:26:31.210 --> 02:26:31.370]
Yeah.

[02:26:31.650 --> 02:26:32.210]
And I agree.

[02:26:32.690 --> 02:26:33.810]
The books are much better.

[02:26:34.450 --> 02:26:34.670]
Yeah.

[02:26:35.510 --> 02:26:36.690]
Hey, I was just about to do that.

[02:26:36.890 --> 02:26:37.550]
The sides are coming up.

[02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:38.770]
Hey, check this out this morning.

[02:26:39.170 --> 02:26:40.130]
Do you say check this out?

[02:26:40.430 --> 02:26:41.190]
I had not again.

[02:26:41.350 --> 02:26:42.050]
Okay, what's up?

[02:26:42.290 --> 02:26:42.550]
All right.

[02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.810]
What's up?

[02:26:43.230 --> 02:26:44.210]
The old, what's up?

[02:26:44.650 --> 02:26:46.170]
The old lady came home, right?

[02:26:46.450 --> 02:26:47.990]
She pulled an online her last night, right?

[02:26:48.390 --> 02:26:49.530]
She came home this morning.

[02:26:50.430 --> 02:26:50.770]
I was okay.

[02:26:50.770 --> 02:26:51.990]
She pulled an online her doing what?

[02:26:52.450 --> 02:26:53.310]
I don't know.

[02:26:53.370 --> 02:26:54.090]
I did the finger test.

[02:26:54.270 --> 02:26:54.990]
I came up positive.

[02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:57.530]
I gave her the finger test.

[02:26:57.650 --> 02:26:58.370]
It came up positive.

[02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.730]
Yeah.

[02:26:58.930 --> 02:27:02.510]
But if it were anyway, while watching the tape that I got from you about a year ago.

[02:27:02.590 --> 02:27:02.770]
Yeah.

[02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:04.550]
And that, that was just great, man.

[02:27:04.770 --> 02:27:05.050]
Okay.

[02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:06.230]
Well, listen, watch your old dipstick.

[02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:09.970]
5667-05, the patient is going to probably turn to the dipstick.

[02:27:10.810 --> 02:27:13.290]
5667-0560, bomb-560 on the AT.

[02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:16.390]
Then you know you got problems when your dipstick turns into your, uh,

[02:27:16.390 --> 02:27:17.390]
a dot-squared, squared dipstick.

[02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:17.890]
That's right.

[02:27:19.130 --> 02:27:20.750]
But anyway, give her the old finger test.

[02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:21.470]
I bet you did.

[02:27:22.730 --> 02:27:24.210]
Here's a mobile and popular hello.

[02:27:25.610 --> 02:27:26.670]
Probably right up to the elbow.

[02:27:26.830 --> 02:27:27.130]
Yes, sir.

[02:27:27.370 --> 02:27:28.330]
Oh, you liked my day.

[02:27:28.890 --> 02:27:29.590]
Listen, I want to know.

[02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:33.730]
Did you, uh, I sent a photograph to you about the ski slopes in Park City.

[02:27:33.870 --> 02:27:34.210]
I want to know.

[02:27:34.210 --> 02:27:34.370]
Yes, sir.

[02:27:34.410 --> 02:27:35.270]
The glory hole place.

[02:27:35.570 --> 02:27:36.090]
You love that?

[02:27:36.210 --> 02:27:36.670]
I loved it.

[02:27:36.730 --> 02:27:37.330]
It's up on the wall.

[02:27:37.410 --> 02:27:41.090]
It's got a print right right by where the poke, the poke, and the upheap show is right next to that.

[02:27:41.530 --> 02:27:43.090]
Well, when you go back on the way out, the wall.

[02:27:43.170 --> 02:27:45.870]
In fact, it's interesting because the poke is peering into it.

[02:27:45.870 --> 02:27:47.750]
So I guess the poke must be peering into the glory hole.

[02:27:48.610 --> 02:27:51.830]
Well, I think you leared over too far for the current head the other day, Denny.

[02:27:51.950 --> 02:27:52.950]
Yeah, he got a little, uh, yeah.

[02:27:52.990 --> 02:27:54.450]
And that made the CBS ignoes.

[02:27:54.650 --> 02:27:57.030]
But I'm not an, uh, the, the head thing was a few days ago.

[02:27:57.110 --> 02:27:57.950]
Now he's got the flu.

[02:27:58.130 --> 02:28:00.230]
And that was a big story on the CBS ignoes.

[02:28:00.430 --> 02:28:02.070]
Somebody ought to tell those people are at CBS.

[02:28:02.250 --> 02:28:05.110]
And when a poke gets a cold, it's not really a news story, okay?

[02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:07.570]
I know there was a lead in yesterday morning on the news.

[02:28:07.730 --> 02:28:08.390]
Is that incredible?

[02:28:08.850 --> 02:28:09.850]
Nothing about cost of all.

[02:28:09.990 --> 02:28:11.010]
And everything like that was the poke.

[02:28:11.230 --> 02:28:11.630]
Yeah, right.

[02:28:12.050 --> 02:28:13.570]
I'm a little, little, little couple of things.

[02:28:13.570 --> 02:28:15.210]
Uh, page three of the hell today.

[02:28:15.430 --> 02:28:19.370]
I bet the NRA is up in arms because Sheriff Ken Jenny was throwing the, uh,

[02:28:19.750 --> 02:28:22.170]
all those guns overboard out there in the ocean to see that.

[02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:23.030]
No, he didn't see that.

[02:28:23.170 --> 02:28:26.070]
Yeah, he was, uh, showing a picture of him on a boat throwing guns overboard.

[02:28:26.270 --> 02:28:26.410]
Yeah.

[02:28:26.470 --> 02:28:27.310]
A thousand feet of water.

[02:28:27.710 --> 02:28:29.150]
They're probably crying in their beer.

[02:28:29.250 --> 02:28:31.770]
Well, I think next week he's going to be throwing guns overboard with one hand

[02:28:31.770 --> 02:28:33.890]
and people from the swing clubs overboard on the other side.

[02:28:34.990 --> 02:28:35.670]
They're swinging it.

[02:28:35.890 --> 02:28:36.450]
They're swinging it.

[02:28:36.470 --> 02:28:37.150]
Have a great day, sir.

[02:28:38.230 --> 02:28:39.430]
He's throwing everybody overboard.

[02:28:39.650 --> 02:28:42.750]
Now Ken Jenny, man, he never met a political office he didn't aspire to.

[02:28:42.750 --> 02:28:43.670]
Fashes pig.

[02:28:43.850 --> 02:28:44.450]
Watch out for him.

[02:28:44.550 --> 02:28:45.210]
I'm telling you right now.

[02:28:45.450 --> 02:28:48.370]
And just like with the jet bursting, they'll call me now and tell me that he's a fascist.

[02:28:48.670 --> 02:28:50.590]
I told you that ahead of time before it was too late.

[02:28:51.490 --> 02:28:52.450]
Did it make any difference?

[02:28:52.670 --> 02:28:52.790]
No.

[02:28:52.930 --> 02:28:53.070]
No.

[02:28:53.410 --> 02:28:54.890]
And now the same thing with this Ken Jenny.

[02:28:56.910 --> 02:29:00.950]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:02.550]
You call that a Jew?

[02:29:02.550 --> 02:29:04.090]
Do you?

[02:29:49.690 --> 02:29:50.970]
Yes.

[02:29:50.970 --> 02:29:50.970]

[02:29:57.850 --> 02:30:02.530]
Do you close your head and then touched that wire.

[02:30:09.690 --> 02:30:14.150]
She was twenty five, but she's just a thief.

[02:30:15.050 --> 02:30:22.510]
No, sixteen, I said my last, but please, Daddy, call the cops with mine.

[02:30:22.850 --> 02:30:31.570]
So I got so perfect to wait, because I'll have such a big, known of my customers by name.

[02:30:32.590 --> 02:30:38.130]
My butt's a big one, oh, my show.

[02:30:38.850 --> 02:30:41.430]
She's a big, she's okay.

[02:30:41.950 --> 02:30:43.330]
She's a big, she's fine.

[02:30:44.050 --> 02:30:46.130]
You should be sad, or sad.

[02:30:46.810 --> 02:30:47.730]
You're a middle.

[02:30:48.210 --> 02:30:52.230]
You should be sad, or sad.

[02:30:52.490 --> 02:30:52.930]
You should be sad, or sad.

[02:30:53.630 --> 02:30:55.810]
She's a big, she's fine.

[02:30:55.810 --> 02:30:56.410]
She's a big, she's fine.

[02:30:59.450 --> 02:31:01.090]
She's just a thief.

[02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:05.010]
Anyway, it's 131 at 560 WQM.

[02:31:05.130 --> 02:31:10.750]
Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, and of course all three of these people are really big because they can really say.

[02:31:11.550 --> 02:31:14.530]
Huh? Because they have great voices, and they can really build out a tune.

[02:31:15.090 --> 02:31:16.250]
Huh? Is that the reason why?

[02:31:16.810 --> 02:31:18.550]
No, no, I wonder how should it have to be.

[02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:22.330]
If they look great, everybody likes their videos. Everybody's got their hand between their somebody's legs.

[02:31:22.590 --> 02:31:23.190]
What's wrong with that?

[02:31:23.830 --> 02:31:26.130]
I mean, you know, if the music is good, that may be a little bonus.

[02:31:27.010 --> 02:31:31.470]
They want to think about my backstreet voice. They may not look all that great unless you got bad eyesight, but they can say.

[02:31:31.570 --> 02:31:32.210]
There you go.

[02:31:32.450 --> 02:31:35.430]
And their album's number one in about 5,000 countries all over the world.

[02:31:35.970 --> 02:31:38.810]
And the best part of it is they're not Ricky Martin, there's like a public service.

[02:31:40.090 --> 02:31:41.530]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello.

[02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:42.730]
Hi, how are you now?

[02:31:42.790 --> 02:31:43.810]
Wait, never been better, sir.

[02:31:44.090 --> 02:31:45.170]
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

[02:31:45.690 --> 02:31:48.670]
I love listening to you show a couple of things I like to talk about.

[02:31:48.810 --> 02:31:49.750]
First of all, about the actors.

[02:31:50.590 --> 02:31:51.510]
You were asking about...

[02:31:51.510 --> 02:31:54.550]
How come nobody is touching that, man? We should spend weeks on that.

[02:31:54.750 --> 02:32:02.330]
Well, here I am. Okay. First of all, I don't know who's the greatest actors, but I know that two of my personal favorites were Gene Kelly and Jimmy Cagney.

[02:32:02.950 --> 02:32:03.590]
Gene Kelly?

[02:32:03.870 --> 02:32:04.190]
Yeah.

[02:32:04.330 --> 02:32:05.390]
Wasn't an actor. He's a dancer.

[02:32:05.650 --> 02:32:07.870]
I know, but I enjoyed his movies. Let's put that way.

[02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:09.250]
You like musicals, well.

[02:32:09.430 --> 02:32:12.350]
Yeah, but no, I like Jimmy Cagney, and he was one of the greatest...

[02:32:12.350 --> 02:32:13.270]
Jimmy Cagney was good.

[02:32:13.490 --> 02:32:14.710]
A great model, dirty rat.

[02:32:14.870 --> 02:32:17.110]
Of course, he always was doing U-turn. He was up, but he was good.

[02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:21.110]
Right, and the grapefruit, which was his invention. That was a great...

[02:32:21.930 --> 02:32:23.270]
He invented the grapefruit?

[02:32:23.410 --> 02:32:25.150]
Well, in that scene, with A-clock.

[02:32:25.410 --> 02:32:30.330]
I mean, it wasn't supposed to be like that, and he decided to do that, and they kept it in.

[02:32:30.590 --> 02:32:33.630]
And it was a great scene, one of the Hollywood's greatest scenes.

[02:32:34.690 --> 02:32:36.470]
But here's another question for you.

[02:32:37.330 --> 02:32:40.070]
How many actors today could have been an actor back then?

[02:32:40.450 --> 02:32:40.590]
None.

[02:32:41.010 --> 02:32:42.570]
Well, maybe Harrison Ford.

[02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:44.130]
Yeah, he's okay.

[02:32:44.310 --> 02:32:45.410]
Yeah, maybe Harrison Ford.

[02:32:45.410 --> 02:32:49.830]
But the actors today, I mean, the only ones who are great are the ones who were like a carryover

[02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:52.890]
from the previous generation like Robert DuVal and Pacino and those of us.

[02:32:53.210 --> 02:32:56.230]
But the new crowd that you got there, most of them could not be able to have a paper sack.

[02:32:56.470 --> 02:32:58.270]
Right, but I think like Brad Pitt, for example.

[02:32:58.410 --> 02:33:02.270]
Right, but I think a person like Harrison Ford could have been a star back in the 40s and 50s.

[02:33:02.310 --> 02:33:03.950]
Possibly, yeah. He had that charisma.

[02:33:03.950 --> 02:33:08.310]
Right. And the other thing, you were talking yesterday about the restaurants.

[02:33:08.790 --> 02:33:16.250]
And one of my students passed me to Capitol Grill. Have you ever been there?

[02:33:16.390 --> 02:33:16.570]
No.

[02:33:16.970 --> 02:33:18.510]
That's the old-sized Rivergate.

[02:33:19.150 --> 02:33:19.470]
Oh, yeah.

[02:33:20.070 --> 02:33:22.410]
And it's the Steakhouse and not bad at all.

[02:33:22.550 --> 02:33:22.730]
Really?

[02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:23.650]
Not bad at all.

[02:33:24.070 --> 02:33:25.410]
And it was very good.

[02:33:25.630 --> 02:33:25.930]
Good meat?

[02:33:26.270 --> 02:33:26.490]
Yeah.

[02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:26.970]
Excellent.

[02:33:27.270 --> 02:33:28.610]
Okay, what was looking for good meat?

[02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:30.510]
Yeah, well, you'd find it there.

[02:33:30.650 --> 02:33:30.930]
Okay.

[02:33:31.130 --> 02:33:33.390]
Okay, also, you're doing a Earthly movies?

[02:33:34.050 --> 02:33:34.590]
You might do one.

[02:33:34.890 --> 02:33:37.650]
You're giving away tickets for, not Earthly, so it's all done.

[02:33:38.030 --> 02:33:39.530]
Oh, then just just ran out.

[02:33:39.650 --> 02:33:41.310]
Oh, I was going to ask if I could get some.

[02:33:41.310 --> 02:33:42.190]
Okay, have a good day.

[02:33:43.450 --> 02:33:46.270]
I'm not giving him movies for the tarzant for a cartoon.

[02:33:46.310 --> 02:33:48.210]
Come on, this guy sounded a good guy.

[02:33:48.210 --> 02:33:49.850]
I have a little bit dangerous son, if you ask me.

[02:33:49.950 --> 02:33:52.030]
We don't want him in a movie theater full, little kids.

[02:33:54.010 --> 02:33:54.370]
5670560.

[02:33:54.690 --> 02:33:56.230]
He, this guy's looking for juicy meat.

[02:33:56.410 --> 02:33:57.770]
You know, you're not going to send him in there.

[02:33:59.550 --> 02:34:01.970]
5670560.560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:34:03.430 --> 02:34:04.950]
Here's a lady in North Miami.

[02:34:04.950 --> 02:34:05.230]
Hello.

[02:34:06.570 --> 02:34:07.010]
Pardon?

[02:34:07.870 --> 02:34:09.410]
I said, here's a lady in North Miami.

[02:34:09.610 --> 02:34:14.090]
Okay, I kind of bleep when you said it because I told you.

[02:34:14.090 --> 02:34:16.950]
That's a Linda Blur said, it bleeds and it burns is what she said.

[02:34:17.230 --> 02:34:18.570]
Yeah, the phone bleep.

[02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:20.450]
And JP said, if it bleeds, well, anyway.

[02:34:21.270 --> 02:34:23.970]
Okay, and I told George, actually, I'm in New Orleans,

[02:34:24.010 --> 02:34:25.670]
but he put me in North Miami being...

[02:34:25.670 --> 02:34:26.910]
Well, he's old confused today.

[02:34:27.290 --> 02:34:29.150]
So he doesn't even sound like himself today.

[02:34:29.850 --> 02:34:34.090]
And I listen to you every day and I keep thinking.

[02:34:34.090 --> 02:34:36.870]
I'm going to call you on my day off to tell you what I think.

[02:34:37.230 --> 02:34:39.250]
Yeah, they think that if it bleeds, it leads.

[02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:41.250]
I think of the channel 7 news, I guess.

[02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:45.310]
And one of the things was these calls you got about George,

[02:34:45.870 --> 02:34:47.250]
where people didn't like him?

[02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:48.610]
I like five of those.

[02:34:49.010 --> 02:34:51.290]
And we got an audience of 17 million people,

[02:34:51.290 --> 02:34:52.770]
and only five people didn't like him.

[02:34:53.130 --> 02:34:57.650]
I really got upset because if you listen to him when he first came on,

[02:34:57.790 --> 02:34:59.970]
I'm like, I really think he was terrible in the beginning.

[02:35:00.250 --> 02:35:01.650]
And he was terrible in the beginning.

[02:35:01.650 --> 02:35:03.970]
And he was like, that's all I'm doing.

[02:35:06.990 --> 02:35:09.530]
He was doing commercials now.

[02:35:09.750 --> 02:35:10.390]
He's doing appearances.

[02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:11.430]
He's getting ready.

[02:35:11.550 --> 02:35:12.850]
He's getting ready to move right on in.

[02:35:13.290 --> 02:35:15.090]
What do you mean he's going to happen about six weeks?

[02:35:15.910 --> 02:35:18.450]
He needs a little more of your comedy cut.

[02:35:18.590 --> 02:35:20.610]
Yeah, well, you know, that's something either you got it,

[02:35:20.710 --> 02:35:21.750]
or you don't have it.

[02:35:22.190 --> 02:35:24.670]
And of course being a serally little hard-headed spick like he is.

[02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:28.010]
I mean, he's not a funny guy, but he's fine.

[02:35:28.510 --> 02:35:32.390]
Also, the actors, I agree with you, Robert Mitchen.

[02:35:32.790 --> 02:35:33.710]
I like him.

[02:35:33.710 --> 02:35:34.810]
How about Robert Wagner?

[02:35:34.990 --> 02:35:35.330]
He looked good.

[02:35:35.410 --> 02:35:35.890]
He couldn't act.

[02:35:36.150 --> 02:35:37.630]
He looked by today's standards.

[02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:39.310]
If you look good, you're actually an actor, I guess.

[02:35:39.550 --> 02:35:39.790]
Right.

[02:35:40.150 --> 02:35:42.410]
But I was also wondering about Gary Cooper.

[02:35:42.990 --> 02:35:45.770]
Gary Cooper is number 11, right behind Charlie Chaplin?

[02:35:46.050 --> 02:35:46.910]
Oh, he is fabulous.

[02:35:47.370 --> 02:35:47.830]
Right ahead of Gregory.

[02:35:48.010 --> 02:35:50.610]
Now, how could Gregory Peck be down as far as number 12?

[02:35:50.890 --> 02:35:52.390]
He's got to be in the top five, doesn't he?

[02:35:53.130 --> 02:35:54.250]
Yeah, I like him.

[02:35:54.390 --> 02:35:55.550]
Gregory Peck was great.

[02:35:56.850 --> 02:35:58.290]
Most everything he made.

[02:35:58.410 --> 02:35:59.270]
To kill a mockingbird?

[02:36:00.110 --> 02:36:00.370]
Uh.

[02:36:00.370 --> 02:36:03.050]
And now I think he lost it when he did that Omen.

[02:36:03.170 --> 02:36:04.430]
I think that also hurt William Holden.

[02:36:04.510 --> 02:36:06.690]
He did Omen 2 and Gregory Peck did Omen 1.

[02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:08.870]
And I think that was an Omen for them falling down and listening.

[02:36:09.350 --> 02:36:10.410]
It was a bad Omen.

[02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.910]
Well listen, you have a great touch, though.

[02:36:11.930 --> 02:36:14.830]
Listen, one more thing, if I could.

[02:36:15.510 --> 02:36:16.310]
Are you still there?

[02:36:16.690 --> 02:36:16.970]
I'm here.

[02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:17.710]
Okay.

[02:36:18.230 --> 02:36:22.150]
You know, when you go down Honey Hill Hill road, take your turn.

[02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:24.030]
One, four, forty one going to work.

[02:36:24.490 --> 02:36:24.750]
Right.

[02:36:25.310 --> 02:36:27.630]
Okay, well, it's from 99 and all the different.

[02:36:27.630 --> 02:36:28.470]
I'm going to work on the one I need to have.

[02:36:28.830 --> 02:36:28.830]

[02:36:28.830 --> 02:36:29.030]
Wow.

[02:36:29.310 --> 02:36:29.590]
It's nice.

[02:36:30.590 --> 02:36:32.710]
But you make your left, right?

[02:36:32.970 --> 02:36:33.130]
Right.

[02:36:33.290 --> 02:36:35.070]
And I go through that thing every day.

[02:36:35.190 --> 02:36:35.770]
Oh, that's horrible.

[02:36:36.150 --> 02:36:41.810]
And the people making left against us, I have counted as high as 14 cars,

[02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:45.870]
making coming through the green lights, making that turn.

[02:36:45.970 --> 02:36:47.490]
If they're in that lane, they're coming through.

[02:36:47.530 --> 02:36:48.630]
There isn't any light there.

[02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:52.010]
There's no, yeah, I'm 4.41.

[02:36:52.250 --> 02:36:53.650]
Oh, you mean I'm 4.41, right?

[02:36:53.830 --> 02:36:54.970]
Yeah, oh, yeah, forget that.

[02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:57.050]
And I don't know.

[02:36:57.210 --> 02:36:58.330]
Did you have any tickets?

[02:36:58.910 --> 02:37:00.770]
I like, I'm like George, I like cars.

[02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:03.290]
Get the honey tune, yeah.

[02:37:03.390 --> 02:37:04.110]
Just ran out to me.

[02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:04.830]
Don't have a great day.

[02:37:05.970 --> 02:37:07.010]
Well, no, I mean, we have a quarter.

[02:37:07.090 --> 02:37:07.770]
We can't give them today.

[02:37:07.870 --> 02:37:12.550]
Plus, she's, we want to send people to see Tarzan, the cartoon,

[02:37:12.550 --> 02:37:14.710]
who are like under the age of, I mean, she's very nice.

[02:37:14.830 --> 02:37:16.830]
And I don't want to like offend anybody unless I have to.

[02:37:16.930 --> 02:37:18.530]
But I mean, no, the answer is just plain.

[02:37:18.650 --> 02:37:19.630]
No, don't take it hard.

[02:37:19.690 --> 02:37:21.150]
I mean, you know, no, that's all.

[02:37:21.270 --> 02:37:21.390]
No.

[02:37:22.170 --> 02:37:22.930]
Am I going to give them to her?

[02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.150]
No.

[02:37:24.030 --> 02:37:25.790]
Did I have any bad feelings about no?

[02:37:26.130 --> 02:37:27.170]
It's just the way it is.

[02:37:27.490 --> 02:37:28.210]
It's not personal.

[02:37:29.050 --> 02:37:31.530]
I like you, there was a call was okay.

[02:37:31.750 --> 02:37:32.150]
I mean, not spectacular.

[02:37:33.090 --> 02:37:34.570]
It was fair, yeah, it was weak.

[02:37:34.830 --> 02:37:35.310]
No, it was okay.

[02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:39.970]
No, but, no, she was very nice.

[02:37:40.770 --> 02:37:42.730]
But just because you're nice to them, I'm going to give you tickets.

[02:37:43.090 --> 02:37:44.770]
Like that one lady before, she wanted tickets.

[02:37:45.030 --> 02:37:46.930]
And she wanted that fill all you can eat Negro.

[02:37:47.170 --> 02:37:48.050]
Did I give her either one on?

[02:37:48.110 --> 02:37:48.810]
She was still great.

[02:37:49.230 --> 02:37:50.130]
See, that's a real fan.

[02:37:51.030 --> 02:37:52.550]
Not something that if you don't give them something,

[02:37:52.670 --> 02:37:56.390]
not you suck, yeah, I mean, that's, that's, uh, yeah, that's just a free loader.

[02:37:57.090 --> 02:38:01.030]
And believe me, I can smell the difference between a real fan and a free loader anytime.

[02:38:02.570 --> 02:38:05.090]
22 before 2 at 560 WQA.

[02:38:05.230 --> 02:38:07.410]
Okay, hold her up the mold, mom.

[02:38:24.310 --> 02:38:25.230]
I'm not here.

[02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:27.070]
I'm not here.

[02:38:29.230 --> 02:38:29.730]
I'm not here.

[02:38:30.150 --> 02:38:30.570]
I'm not here.

[02:38:30.990 --> 02:38:31.490]
I'm not here.

[02:38:31.870 --> 02:38:32.350]
I'm not here.

[02:38:32.830 --> 02:38:33.210]
I'm not here.

[02:38:33.450 --> 02:38:33.450]

[02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:34.910]
I'm not here.

[02:38:35.170 --> 02:38:36.050]
I'm not here.

[02:38:36.050 --> 02:38:36.250]
I'm not here.

[02:38:36.250 --> 02:38:37.810]
I'm not here.

[02:38:37.810 --> 02:38:40.490]
I'm not here.

[02:38:40.570 --> 02:38:41.730]
I'm not here.

[02:38:42.210 --> 02:38:42.390]
I'm not here.

[02:38:42.390 --> 02:38:44.410]
I'm not here.

[02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:46.010]
I'm not here.

[02:38:46.010 --> 02:38:47.190]
I'm not here.

[02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:47.890]
I'm not here.

[02:38:47.890 --> 02:38:47.890]

[02:38:47.890 --> 02:38:47.890]

[02:39:24.610 --> 02:39:25.130]
Yes.

[02:39:25.570 --> 02:39:29.030]
I really don't know where I went wrong.

[02:39:29.470 --> 02:39:31.330]
Maybe he heard something.

[02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:33.130]
I'm not here.

[02:39:33.190 --> 02:39:33.390]
Yes.

[02:39:33.690 --> 02:39:33.690]

[02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:39.750]
Yes.

[02:39:42.390 --> 02:39:42.570]
Yes.

[02:39:43.510 --> 02:39:44.230]
I'm not here.

[02:39:48.030 --> 02:39:48.050]
Yes.

[02:39:48.050 --> 02:39:48.050]

[02:39:48.050 --> 02:39:48.050]

[02:39:48.050 --> 02:39:48.050]

[02:39:48.050 --> 02:39:48.050]

[02:39:48.050 --> 02:39:48.050]

[02:39:48.050 --> 02:39:48.050]

[02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:48.150]
Yes.

[02:39:49.670 --> 02:39:49.670]

[02:39:49.670 --> 02:39:53.490]
that gets separated from the goal stick fairly often yes and i tried they've

[02:39:53.490 --> 02:39:54.870]
warned about that that's a penalty

[02:39:55.510 --> 02:39:58.250]
well i can any of the other players on the ice if you throw your stick is a

[02:39:58.250 --> 02:40:01.190]
penalty and they warned him again the other night that if he keeps doing that

[02:40:01.190 --> 02:40:03.190]
they're going to start to give him a penalty for the lay-a-game

[02:40:03.190 --> 02:40:08.190]
my question was it can the opponent try to move the stick further away from

[02:40:08.190 --> 02:40:12.330]
him and if they do is that is that a penalty no of course not if he throws the

[02:40:12.330 --> 02:40:15.030]
stick they can kick it they can do whatever they want a bit

[02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:18.350]
it just seems to me that one time i saw one of the skaters from the north

[02:40:18.350 --> 02:40:25.390]
start from the start from the stars skate over it avoiding and i put the

[02:40:25.390 --> 02:40:28.650]
the key thing to do would be to actually take it away yeah you're right

[02:40:28.650 --> 02:40:31.730]
because his favorite thing i'm sure you've seen this is that he likes to drop

[02:40:31.730 --> 02:40:34.730]
this stick in the in the right in the middle of the crease so that if he's

[02:40:34.730 --> 02:40:36.550]
out of position like when he's at a lot of pressure

[02:40:37.130 --> 02:40:41.450]
he's not a position flopping around that it maybe uh... well a shot will hit

[02:40:41.450 --> 02:40:44.650]
the stick and it'll deflect it out so it's like adding another uh... you know

[02:40:44.650 --> 02:40:46.490]
block to the uh... you're right though

[02:40:46.490 --> 02:40:50.550]
but there he does all sorts of things and of course uh... you know he's always

[02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:54.110]
well and then the great players that he sport uh... they get away with it well

[02:40:54.110 --> 02:40:58.370]
and then that was some save don't you think that uh... that uh... any the ego had

[02:40:58.370 --> 02:41:01.630]
with that goal stick when he was out of the shabby that was incredible yeah there

[02:41:01.630 --> 02:41:04.870]
there were great saves on both sides that that game was one of the best i've seen in

[02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:06.470]
the game these guys can really stop it yeah

[02:41:06.470 --> 02:41:09.730]
uh... one question about an actor opinion on the opavik

[02:41:11.290 --> 02:41:15.950]
who is it the guy that was the villain in uh... the clint Eastwood movie that he

[02:41:15.950 --> 02:41:17.850]
played the deranged guy in the line of fire

[02:41:17.850 --> 02:41:19.270]
i think that's the thing

[02:41:19.270 --> 02:41:20.670]
a malkovich yeah

[02:41:20.670 --> 02:41:23.910]
good at the end i don't even know who that is uh... okay

[02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:25.190]
george says yes

[02:41:25.850 --> 02:41:27.750]
you know what that means okay see it

[02:41:28.450 --> 02:41:31.230]
john malkovich i probably would almost like some of the song i know my father

[02:41:31.230 --> 02:41:33.850]
i mean clint Eastwood movies the only clinese would movie i liked

[02:41:33.850 --> 02:41:37.670]
was plenty for me which wasn't like any of the dirty hearing movies it was a great

[02:41:37.670 --> 02:41:39.950]
movie with Jessica what's her name Jessica

[02:41:42.190 --> 02:41:45.810]
Jessica something whatever any why doesn't make any difference you know what i'm

[02:41:45.810 --> 02:41:49.410]
crazy but she was great and he was good that was an excellent movie

[02:41:49.410 --> 02:41:53.390]
and of course because he was a d jade of and you notice by the way if you watch

[02:41:53.390 --> 02:41:55.870]
that movie never been radio if you ever were this jockey

[02:41:57.170 --> 02:42:00.230]
he cues up at the way he cues up the record i mean how long would it have

[02:42:00.230 --> 02:42:03.530]
taken to show him how you keep up a record before you're going to play it

[02:42:03.530 --> 02:42:07.050]
and he likes to see uh... the needle on the uh... you like stick the needle on

[02:42:07.050 --> 02:42:10.090]
the record you know it's like put the lotion the basket stick the needle on

[02:42:10.090 --> 02:42:12.650]
the record and just like it looks that's not how you play it clint

[02:42:13.210 --> 02:42:15.130]
no one had that cycle but chasing around

[02:42:16.750 --> 02:42:19.070]
but he sure was a mean d j wasn't

[02:42:19.750 --> 02:42:20.870]
here's a lot of the whole

[02:42:21.350 --> 02:42:25.010]
he was better than pretty crews yes sir i had a question about the guards for

[02:42:25.010 --> 02:42:25.570]
you sure

[02:42:26.010 --> 02:42:28.610]
i spoke about the box press the guard the other day

[02:42:29.210 --> 02:42:33.110]
a box press the guard yeah it was kind of weird to be like a usual

[02:42:33.690 --> 02:42:37.210]
uh... cigar was like to squish down into like almost like a box shape

[02:42:37.770 --> 02:42:40.610]
i was just wondering if you ever heard of that or if you know what the point of

[02:42:40.670 --> 02:42:44.270]
box sheets pressing the guard on the pins on which box you put it i guess

[02:42:45.130 --> 02:42:48.210]
now i guess you have to call up but he knows all about that

[02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:52.650]
maybe it's one of those new monocles five six seven oh five sixty pound five

[02:42:52.650 --> 02:42:53.490]
sixty on it

[02:42:53.490 --> 02:42:56.370]
see i don't probably a lot of people around you know asking questions like did

[02:42:56.370 --> 02:42:58.710]
he stick it in a record like where exactly did it go

[02:42:59.910 --> 02:43:02.790]
i think they have a few file at point there people have no lives of the

[02:43:02.790 --> 02:43:05.370]
one worried about where did the president stick his cigar and did he actually

[02:43:05.370 --> 02:43:07.430]
lighted up after he stuck in her uh...

[02:43:07.430 --> 02:43:08.030]
i'll whatever

[02:43:08.030 --> 02:43:11.130]

[02:44:59.310 --> 02:44:59.710]
out

[02:45:00.590 --> 02:45:01.550]
and i was it

[02:45:01.950 --> 02:45:02.810]
