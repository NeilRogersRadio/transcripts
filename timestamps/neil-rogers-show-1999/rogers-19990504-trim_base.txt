[00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.320]
430560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Roger Show.

[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.240]
To talk to Neil called 560560 toll free for David Brower in 4.560 on yourself.

[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.220]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not necessarily

[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.140]
reflect those of WQAM.

[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.320]
We back with you.

[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.960]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.700]
Neil Rogers, no.

[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.420]
430560 WQAM.

[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.580]
So Bob, we know I want to tell you something.

[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.220]
You're all a bunch of sentiment bitches.

[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.620]
I just tell you what you said.

[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.040]
What are they?

[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.340]
I just want to get rid of this old kite on the phone.

[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.240]
You got the pearl right there.

[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.120]
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.220]
How the fuck are you?

[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.620]
Excuse your language now.

[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.000]
Excuse your language now.

[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.000]

[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.000]

[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.860]
Oh, they worked in the year.

[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.420]
And I've got no fear.

[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.600]
Don't be nowhere to know man.

[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.880]
Don't be fooling me.

[00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.280]
Back on.

[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.780]
The fight for a lift.

[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.520]
And move that limb.

[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.100]
Yeah.

[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.960]
The choir's face that leads you into it.

[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.840]
It's easily this just did.

[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.840]
Things that it's heinous.

[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.420]
But like a faith man, I'm fungal in during it.

[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.860]
If it's my cocaine, it's gonna be.

[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.760]
The wind's playing the rising.

[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.480]
Your money's shining on me.

[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.960]
See if I can pay any to me.

[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.620]
Well, say the heavy blade.

[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.520]
The tongue-washed and I just say.

[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.060]
You're making me a hero by that damn traitor.

[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.600]
Now I'm a real super god my tongue-offing hero, who hurts?

[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.800]
Please, I'll let them shoot to the distance.

[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.720]
I got a necessity to be seen.

[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.300]
My friends call me in number two.

[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.200]
I sure do really chop chop.

[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.620]
But I prefer to do.

[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.200]
If it's like your baby's doing things.

[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.160]
So please, it's better I say.

[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.880]
Yeah.

[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.760]
The moon is shining on me.

[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.200]
It's like a penny to me.

[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.880]
Now, to the way that K-Walkers are lit, I'm gonna strive.

[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.300]
Trust me, I'll both hurt you.

[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.460]
Things get not diluted when I see real door to room for you.

[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.240]
And I'll wash those hell with not-go-throughs.

[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.680]
When will I do?

[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.500]
Please, miss, feeling like a man.

[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.880]
You'll find it hard to sit down when I get done with your can.

[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.060]
Things like the penny is too big.

[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.740]
Right, right, right, right, right, right, don't-

[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.160]
Okay.

[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.120]
Things like the penny.

[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.740]
Things like the penny.

[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.000]
Things like the penny to me.

[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.940]
Title 456, you have a freaking of the rim man, by the way.

[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.780]
Joe Castello was just saying that as compared to feet.

[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.800]
He'd rather check out the old-

[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.200]
Brackdome.

[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.760]
He'd either way.

[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.860]
Not anybody's in particular, just anyone, as opposed to feet.

[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.620]
Not seriously, he's got a foot fetish in reverse.

[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.620]
He just had a whole problem with feet.

[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.760]
Anyway, where the hell do we start today?

[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.880]
God, so much material from that morning show.

[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]
I'm telling you, going through the roof,

[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.780]
why don't we start with that goddamn asshole footy from Y100?

[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.540]
Athletes foot.

[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.860]
There you go.

[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.100]
That's why Joe Castello didn't like him,

[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.740]
because it's footy.

[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.000]
Anything to do with feet, he's pissed off.

[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.140]
I think he made up the whole story.

[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.120]
Now, where was this?

[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.700]
This was at some car racing celebrity race thing.

[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.520]
Grab ass thing.

[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.040]
And Joe Castello walks in there.

[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.140]
And here, and sitting there in this-

[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.400]
And what was the guy from Power 96 doing in there?

[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.480]
Jam and Johnny.

[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.740]
He was jamming it.

[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.060]
He was a celebrity racer.

[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.740]
He was probably making a lot of goddamn noise,

[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.640]
which is what he does best in shaking the walls of Jericho.

[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.480]
So anyway, they're all sitting around.

[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.800]
And then it comes athletes foot.

[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.560]
Footy from Y100.

[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.220]
It's been in the market for 500 years,

[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.140]
and nobody has any idea who he is by the way.

[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.820]
He couldn't care less.

[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.760]
He played a bunch of real crap music for retarded teenagers.

[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.020]
And he comes in and starts and goes up to the guy from Power 96

[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.340]
who hasn't got any idea.

[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.020]
I want to tell you, Jam and Johnny,

[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.060]
which is the kid that made all that noise

[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.460]
in the production of that because he's deaf,

[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.700]
like everybody else over there.

[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.360]
He wouldn't even know where to find our studio,

[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.980]
much less anything about where to find QAM on a radio dial.

[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.280]
That's how much he knows about this station.

[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.480]
And footy goes up to this kid and starts pontificating a whole song

[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.200]
and it ends about what's wrong with his station and the O'Rodgers.

[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.080]
And by the way, good morning to you, footy,

[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.120]
because I know he already told him he listens every day.

[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.860]
He listens every freaking day.

[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.560]
And about how this never works,

[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.240]
why did they bring the O'Rodgers to these stations

[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.900]
because he can't boost up the ratings on the rest of the station

[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.020]
and it never works and all that money they're paying him.

[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.080]
They can never make it back with all those cheap cigar spots that they're running.

[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.620]
Well, what the hell, what does that mean?

[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.180]
That's the most unbelievable thing I've ever heard in my life.

[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.380]
All you have to do, you got a pencil footy,

[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.480]
I know maybe somebody can figure it out for you.

[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.580]
If we were selling the spots on this show for a hundred bucks a pop

[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.160]
and believe me, nobody gets spots on this show that cheap.

[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.380]
But if we were 16 an hour, four hours a day,

[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.180]
that comes out to 64 hundred bucks.

[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.260]
That's 30 grand a week.

[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.140]
It's a million and a half a year, okay?

[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.900]
Selling a bit about half of what they're probably selling them.

[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.000]
But that's a million and a half.

[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.200]
Am I making a million and a half?

[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.400]
No.

[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.080]
Are we making a profit just based on bare bones on that?

[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.500]
Yes.

[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.300]
So what are you talking about, you jackass?

[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.280]
You cypholdin?

[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.480]
You radio weasel?

[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.020]
Here's a guy that's been in the business for what, a hundred years here?

[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.580]
And then why, one hundred?

[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.780]
And guess what?

[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.340]
I just took a look at the numbers here

[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.460]
and I realized that they don't have anybody over the age of 10 listening to that station.

[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.580]
Man, 18 to 34.

[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.120]
Just because, you know, it's only the near Roger Show that's got these big numbers on here.

[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.000]
Right, Mr. Hot Shot?

[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.680]
Many 18 to 34, six to ten in the morning.

[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.520]
The worst team beats them out.

[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.520]
Beats out while 100 to 4.3, share to a 3.7.

[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.560]
Can you believe that?

[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.560]
Would you be a, that's not even close to our demographic on this station.

[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.900]
The worst team beats them out.

[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.260]
Why 100 wither in many 18 to 34?

[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.200]
Midday many 18 to 34.

[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.400]
And in short, we got a 9.2, which means between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.

[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.520]
We got about a 10 share, okay?

[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.860]
And what's why 100 got in this demographic 18 to 34?

[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.020]
A 5.7.

[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.280]
Mr. Athletes, foot, you know what you can do with your foot?

[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.240]
Keep it away from Joe Costello, he says, too, by the way.

[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.180]
Man, I always thought for these foot smell like a penny, you know?

[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.840]
Now I know why.

[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.740]
Yeah, because he's most of the time got it in his back toe, and somebody's probably his own.

[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.720]
Jackass, idiot, Simpleton, and have a nice day, footy, because I know you're listening right now, just like everybody else in a business.

[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.760]
Well, they can't make any money with that new Rogers.

[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.780]
Will all these stations keep bringing them over to their right?

[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.520]
Every station I ever worked for, they lost money on this show, right?

[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.660]
Am I right?

[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.520]
Yeah, they lost money on the new Rogers show.

[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.200]
I got news for you.

[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.740]
If we didn't have to pay ball, they for all these bogus ball games, anybody want to buy any Marlon spots?

[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.140]
No.

[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.520]
Oh, man.

[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.440]
They claimed there was 8,600 or whatever the paid that was tickets all last night.

[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.300]
I got news for you.

[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.000]
I saw about enough of that game.

[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:06.020]
I'm talking early in the game when it was still, you know, a contest when there were still people awaken this town on the Monday night.

[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.140]
If there were 3,000 people there at the peak, that was a lot.

[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.800]
Because the people that were there, they just kind of like all jammed in close together.

[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.380]
Because they really didn't make any difference where they said anyway.

[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.960]
And I flipped back over there when they were in extra innings and there may be maybe were 300 people left.

[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.420]
Anybody want to buy any Marlon spots?

[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:25.640]
No.

[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:34.360]
If we didn't have to, if we had to Greg Reed because of his big sports ass ego, if he hadn't mortgaged this whole place to Baldy, we'd be rollin' a cash here.

[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.340]
The morning team, the worst team, they're not losing money.

[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.620]
The new Roger show sure ain't losing the station money.

[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.260]
Big fat Hank in the afternoon there. He's not losing his money.

[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.740]
The only thing that's got this place mortgaged up to our ass in Elbow is the goddamn sports crack.

[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.860]
Please, anybody want to buy a spot in a Marlon game?

[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.120]
No.

[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:54.740]
50 cents.

[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.060]

The gun's right now, he's thinking, want to copy me and do exactly like I do get paid for writing little songs about

[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:39.320]
my brains all gone, I'm tryna get my groove on but I can't figure out which part's girl I'm gonna fart on

[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.460]
Indoctodreas, yo Major Pascans, yeah I know, What do I smell ass?

[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.240]
Hey you low-play. Well, since age 12 it seemed like I always smelled like

[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:54.680]
buckrippin' Cassas and June was pretty swell, I got this off when I took my jeans off and farted so hard

[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.460]
My

[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.500]
And every night I'm like oh dinner has been put up my ass fast little fat bitch you ain't too fat

[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:08.280]
Smell this honey. Yeah, wait a minute girl, huh? I don't give a fuck God's happy to take some world up

[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.960]
My ain't it my ain't it my ain't it

[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.820]
My ain't it my ain't it

[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.780]
My ain't it see to one of me kicked out back in junior high

[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:27.580]
Said the problem was something pulled up my ass and died I shot him in the face with my vapor

[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.400]
The worst happened later when I covered his desk with you toilet paper

[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.120]
Walked in the stress club my testers will fill them

[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:39.660]
Moons of bartenders took a dump of the tip club went over to a dancer had a fucking agon

[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.860]
She lifted a leg up and I knew she was a father

[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.180]
I

[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:51.580]
To be a famous rapper

[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.620]
You know you was dirt when the women first to leave

[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.080]
My ain't it my ain't it my ain't it

[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]
My ain't it my ain't it my ain't it

[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:27.360]
My ain't it my ain't it my ain't it

[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.620]
Okay, we don't want to be like a one-road Johnny this morning doing okay

[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:38.660]
That's 16 to five sixty WQM. So anyway getting by on before even getting to that stuff just too much stuff today way too much stuff

[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.920]
God must be really pissed off, you know

[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:47.720]
Those poor bastards in Oklahoma and Kansas at least 45 did probably a lot more than that by the time they sift through all the rubble of those

[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720]
Tornado's yesterday

[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:56.320]
And of course even in your insurance policy doesn't let's say active God in regard to like hurricanes and tornadoes and the earthquakes

[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.080]
Etc. And so on doesn't it say active God damn it

[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.260]
What's he pissed off about now?

[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:09.640]
Especially all those good the upstanding religious folk over there and oak that's the Bible bill baby Oklahoma and Kansas

[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:16.500]
Right to the middle of the Bible bill. I thought it was only with a bunch of degenerates down here like a us like up there in Orlando where they had those rainbow fat flags

[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.940]
I thought that's when God gets pissed off

[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:24.360]
He just gets pissed off all the time. It's another act of God and he's more on these idiots

[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.220]
How can there be so many stupid people in one country? How's that possible?

[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:35.320]
Think of a lot there there they're having a joy ride in the oh, let's go and drive right at the tornado

[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.020]
Does the tornado have an eye like a hurricane?

[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.240]
I guess it does. I guess they don't anymore

[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:49.000]
They show this one asshole on this pickup truck damn near God kid the pickup truck looks like it looks like a piece of paper mache at this point

[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.060]
Looks like somebody just picked it up like like that. Just squashed it like a bug

[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.460]
And he's lucky to be a lot. Wow must have been the God was looking out for me. God yeah

[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:06.280]
How come God didn't give you a brain so that you could like stay the hell inside and I get yourself almost killed driving in the middle of this big as

[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.500]
Wild looking tornado. You see that thing

[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.340]
80 mile path that just came right down to the ground and you know usually they bounced up and down and around and all over the place

[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.140]
This one liked I guess I wanted a little free trip on the Hershey highway there

[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.440]
80 miles right across

[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.180]
It's another act of God

[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.000]
God is he working mysterious ways, you know

[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:34.840]
Oh before I get into that morning show this morning and by the way greatest calls I ever heard my life this morning on a morning show

[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.740]
I'm not really sure which was the best weather was that we got a new name for the morning show by the way

[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:45.340]
Joe and the bagel boys. That's the new name for the worst team. I mean, it's better than the worst team sounds

[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:50.080]
You know like almost negative negative story, but Joe and the bagel boys like that

[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.620]
I mean you got your vangle boys and the backseat boys. What's wrong with Joe and the bagel boys?

[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.480]
You jackass you silly old Jew. I'm glad you were stuck out there on the palm metal by the way for an hour

[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.260]
That was a great call

[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.080]
Here's some jackass. It's stuck on a palm metal expressway calls in this morning

[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.960]
And it's very upset because some color before to them is the big old boys

[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:16.920]
Well, I'm sure that if somebody would have called your show and made some derogatory comment about Blacks or Hispanics

[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.280]
That you all three would have jumped down their throat and hung up on them and I'm really offended and upset

[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:29.180]
Well, Cox a hoist pal, okay and get the chip off your shoulder get the big old chip off your shoulder big old boy

[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.620]
Crazy bastard

[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:38.740]
I just thought I passed this along in the passing new hamster repeals ban on gay adoptions conquered new hamster

[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:45.280]
How come it's Concord Michigan by the way and conquered new hamster anybody ever figured that out yet? No

[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:53.320]
New Hampshire on Monday repeal the ban on homosexuals becoming adoptive or foster parents leaving Florida the only state left with such a provision

[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.480]
Let's hear it from Florida baby

[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.320]
All right

[00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.700]
And you can be sure with the the Jebs to in there now you can be damn sure we don't have to worry about that

[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:08.160]
What we do have to worry about though is that last night this was the I told Joe and I haul this was the greatest call in the history of

[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.020]
Talk radio and that covers a lot of territory the one I heard this morning

[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.580]
Just before I entered the building in fact I almost had a change my underwear six times after hearing this call

[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:23.420]
Some hysterical not an old Julio see George always says well, it's just the old Julios in Domino Park

[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:31.180]
There's plenty of other brainwashed masses asses in this town who've been raised that's all they know that

[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:36.640]
There are whole life it's like their life isn't in a little camp like in concentration camp

[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.540]
And nobody will unlock the door and let them out so they can find a real life for life is really all about

[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.920]
Losing the baseball which I told him I mean was there any chance you were else were gonna be the anybody? No no

[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.000]
They could they beat a girls team in a fixed game no

[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.640]
So was there any doubt that the Cuban national team was gonna win a game last night?

[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.780]
Is if anybody cared which most of us did not?

[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.040]
And this guy's assertion on the worst team on the Joe and a bagel boy show this morning was

[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:10.020]
This was the worst thing that ever happened to the United States. Oh

[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.480]
And I'm thinking to myself God I wish I had this guy's problems, you know

[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.660]
In my family we always had this expression that should be your worst problem

[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:32.560]
Sir that should be your worst frickin problem is that the goddamn Cuban national baseball team beat the Baltimore Orioles like everybody else does in a stupid ball game that nobody cared about

[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.260]
It was right there on my small dish did I watch it? No no in fact I flipped over a couple of times

[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.600]
They were in the rain delay and I made a mental note be sure not to tune back again because the game might actually be in progress

[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.800]
Would I see any of it no?

[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:52.600]
I mean when are you people gonna let go already of this madness of this insanity?

[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.480]
All at least they had some people there for that game

[00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.320]
Unlike

[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:01.440]
Unlike

[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.920]
Unlike the marlins anybody any please let's out you know what we're gonna do

[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.280]
You know if the Sam's always looking to send an FU out for you know busy work make it look like they're really doing something

[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.100]
Why not send out the QAM van and try to sell spots on the marlin games?

[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.360]
We'll just find all parts honestly. We'll take one of our sales holes

[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.800]
They're most of the day running around here

[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.920]
I would like chickens with their heads cut off doing nothing

[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.980]
Take Todd Dreck out there. He was just in here stirring up a bunch of crap

[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:31.260]
Take him out on the road. Please don't bring him back or take that Peter Leonard guy out there and

[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.320]
Put him back in the same dumpster that he just hopped out of this morning

[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.820]
And you know take the sales people out on the road and sell Marlin spots at various locations

[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.600]
Like maybe right out here like an eye of the very road right by the ballpark anybody want to buy some

[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.620]
But we got and you know something you think the crowd last night was small

[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.760]
The smallest in Marlin history which they've lost what a hundred in the road now something like that

[00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:01.960]
Wait till tomorrow now tonight. We got the big game of course that'll be a pathetic, but wait until tomorrow afternoon

[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.580]
Which we have another one of our neo-rodgers interrupt the shows tomorrow

[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:12.180]
We have the marlins and the Milwaukee Brewers the game is it won tomorrow so that means the pregame at 12.30

[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.040]
Now can you imagine on a Wednesday afternoon in the middle of the week?

[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.280]
Can't you see all these people taking off from work to go to see a marlin game? No

[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.260]
Seriously you could fit more college students in your average size phone booth

[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.880]
Then there will be at that Marlin game tomorrow afternoon. Am I right?

[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.000]
You bet you're sweet ass

[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.080]
You bet your smelly spencer

[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.280]
And

[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.600]
Then I hear this morning they're talking about well the stadium and yoldie is saying oh yeah, look at time everywhere

[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:49.680]
Over our dead bodies it'll get done. No, but there is no interest nobody cares nobody wants to go nobody wants to participate

[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:56.760]
They've Joseph writes this morning marlins come up empty on the field and in the stand. You're so damn negative Dave

[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.960]
You have to keep writing all these true things. How come you can't blue sky a little bit

[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.420]
By the way nice go and Michael mayo who said of a charismatic and a Kentucky Derby went down a list

[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:10.620]
It's a throwout when it doubts your own out nice go and Michael hold a mayo

[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.860]
By the way, Dave Halberstam still hates you like poison and so do wait

[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:16.440]
Well

[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.760]
Well if we got the big old boys in the morning because there's two Jews on there Joe and the two Jews

[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.420]
What are what are we here the spick in the?

[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.800]
Not a clone cake. Oh, we have a choice with you. Yeah, we got several choices. Yeah

[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.480]
Here's a mobile in four

[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:36.280]
Okay, there's our first call of a not sure for the Q amp phone system again boys and girls there was our first call of the day

[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.480]
That's the office pool which day this year which day this century

[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.800]
Will Neil actually come in in the morning and the phone system be we're working the way that we are supposed to work

[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:52.240]
Is that gonna happen anytime soon? No, we better get a lot of those cheeks the gar spots on here to get a new phone system

[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.060]
Here's the round hello

[00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:01.960]
Yes, sir, no, yes, I know well those tornadoes happen yesterday and where God's match because

[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.380]
That game yesterday with the Cubans. Uh-huh. That must be it

[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:10.100]
No, but on a serious note, you know, you know what I hate these Cubans that come over here

[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.660]
And they they want to tell us what we can do what we can see yet

[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:19.040]
They can't even tell on their own land what they can do how come they want to answer the phone George

[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.640]
He's not talking to you. He's talking to me just to do your thing in there every time George

[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.940]
Here's the worst Cuban all of a sudden the hair stands up on the back of his guy

[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:31.120]
So I don't care what this guy is he's got a right to say his piece. Let him go ahead and rip the Cuban

[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.200]
Not not only do I have to write this at my piece, you know, but it's true

[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.300]
I mean they couldn't do nothing over there

[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:41.600]
So they come over here and now they want to be bosses of a land that's not even theirs

[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.580]
Want to go be a boss and Cuba right? You know go manage a baseball

[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:50.220]
Over there, right? They don't want the people to play and don't want this yet when you're over here

[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:55.000]
Driving them or say he's banned and you go home to AC. It's okay, right?

[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.480]
But you say oh, no, they go home the AC DC sir. You better write

[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.900]
Yeah, you know, and then it's easy for them to say oh the hell with the Cubans over there

[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:10.400]
Yeah, the Cubans over there they got to eat rats man. You guys are eating steak every day over here. You ever had a rat though?

[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.380]
Tastes like a penny. Yep. Okay

[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:14.520]
does

[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.240]
Let's play that song pennies from heaven. Come on everybody when it rains it. Yeah, let's sing it

[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.200]
For all the people eating rats over there. I don't think they're eating a rat

[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:31.640]
My Rob Boost de Monte says he wasn't thinking about such lofty ideals of freedom of expression and freedom of the press last week

[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.760]
When she banned sales of cigar fish you not what my international airport

[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.080]
But that this this and it's you know, I brought this up yesterday

[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.020]
Nobody wants to talk about it, but I will anyway

[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:48.200]
Because it's just pondress and old and debilitating and it keeps this town being the banana boat place that it is and always will be

[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.280]
See I hate to break the news to you sir to one that called on the worst thing this morning

[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.500]
I was doing the big old boys show I hate to break the news to you

[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:04.200]
Nobody in their right mind gives a flying crap about some stupid ball game that was played in Baltimore or any other god damn place last night

[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:04.920]
Okay, sir

[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.900]
I know that coming as a great shot to you and your silly little ego

[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:16.060]
Give it up. Okay. Give it a freaking rest and give us a chance to live a real life in this God for second town in this once beautiful

[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:21.460]
Polatial place before people like you came here with your one dimension only into all minds I

[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:29.060]
Hope you wake up tonight sir in the middle of the night and you turn over and your wife or whoever you're sleeping with it turns out

[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.120]
It looks just like Fidel

[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.020]
Maybe it's the Chupa Cabra, huh the Dubacapa

[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:42.020]
1027 at 560 WQM don't just tasted your snapper

[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.000]

[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:13.900]
Yes, there's a guy my shame to admit it to my wife Sarah exposed part of our ankle. Why that no good. Hussie

[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.620]
If I've got me a good mind put her in the socks and give her 40 lashes

[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:23.900]
Well, that would be a good idea, but then there wouldn't be anyone to milk the cow. Yep women

[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:30.780]
They're the reason we're all going to hill. Yep. Well, I gotta get back to plan the fields. We'll get in

[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.000]

[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.380]
On cops in Pennsylvania Dunch country

[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:51.300]
1032 at 560 WQM Hank Goldberg from Shua State to a two o'clock speaking of Hank by the way and I noticed that boy

[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:58.940]
People must be trying to make them amend those fences now now that Hank is like going right through the roof on the ratings and going on ABC on the Derby

[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.300]
I talk asked on Saturday

[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:06.940]
People was just sucking that big fat Henry Goldberg asked this morning at the end of the show there it was it was almost x-rated it was in

[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:07.400]
Buryson

[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.560]
Talk about a back-toe job. Wow

[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:16.440]
So I don't want to pee on anybody's parade because Hank had a euphoric week in like he said he was a national television

[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.780]
And maybe he's see there with the

[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:24.140]
Barely alive Jim McCay there in the meeting at set of and so on is Jim in case still alive by the way. Nobody told him yet

[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.120]
But in looking through these numbers there is an asterisks next to the afternoon number

[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.820]
I'm come to fight out they did the research and you know all of these days like yesterday for example

[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.380]
And Hank wasn't there the first part of the show

[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.140]
Which seems to be a regular thing there's either like a lot of dead air at the beginning of the show or Hank is like in

[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:46.800]
Transit somewhere or he's just not there or we can't get the thing on here and it comes to find out that all these other people are filling in like

[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.040]
Cory and the clearance and all these other people there are the ones according to the research that had the big number in there

[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.540]
Now when Hank came on it was a five when they were on it was a nine

[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:04.360]
So not only is he awesome thanks to Brook Daniels and Pete Boldro over there at the wheelchair

[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.120]
We're taking away any last semblance of you know the morning those guys got to go up against Howard

[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.860]
We got to go up against big fat Lardas limbaugh, which by the way there's only two markets in America

[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:20.240]
For years now there's only two markets in America where big fat Lardas gets beat

[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.520]
One is San Francisco Rano ones on KGO in San Francisco and the other one is this one right here

[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:33.520]
Which fat ass limbaugh has never come close to our numbers on any station in any a trend in any book at any time I just mentioned that in passing and

[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.600]
I'll Hank has got

[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.820]
That to contend with

[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.940]
But I mean like I said I don't want to be on his parade or anything

[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:48.740]
But the fact that there are all these interruptions all these other people on there evidently can only help so keep it up

[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:56.300]
Anyway, Maira boosts the monta says she wasn't thinking about such lofty ideals as freedom of expression and freedom of the press last week

[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.620]
When she banned sales of cigar fishy and I don't want my international airport

[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:07.900]
Yes, the assistant director of Miami Day deviation department says she flipped through the glossy magazine saw pictures of gorgeous hotels the hotels here

[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.460]
And glittering nightlife in Havana and taught a family and friends back in the city of her birth

[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:17.660]
She and for a go scuba see what I'm talking about people who are living in the fricking past and

[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.680]
Who do all of these things?

[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.960]
It's kind of difficult to swallow she said when you see that's what Monica said too, sweetheart

[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:33.020]
When you see these pictures and know your family's not having that kind of life over there said boost to montaugh who moved to Miami at the age of five in

[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.060]
1962

[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.700]
As she saw it it wasn't really a first amendment issue as she saw

[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.780]
So she checked with the assistant county attorney and other county airport employees

[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.720]
She even told her boss what she was planning that she for bad its sale

[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:57.420]
Causing mayor Alex penis to condemn censorship civil liberties are lawyers threatening to sue the county and the magazine editor to accuse date of acting like Cuba

[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.180]
Like a bunch of fast she's the

[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.640]
Monday afternoon

[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:08.320]
Orkers put 300 copies of the June edition the stacks of the airport 18 new stands ending the four-day flap over boost the monta's ban

[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:12.780]
She just arbitrarily because she didn't like the way it portrayed whatever was it and of course it's interesting

[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.840]
She was leaving through it. She couldn't leave it alone

[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.860]
Just like these assholes

[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:22.660]
There's a whole article of the paper day about the the not just the ones that went on a bus up the Baltimore last night

[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:29.220]
But the agitators down here that had like a little bit of a party watching the game getting all bad out of shape watching it

[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:34.440]
If you're so pissed off about it, why don't you boycott it? Why don't you not watching you idiots?

[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:41.320]
But instead you're lending your tangible support and you're watching it while you're putting on your indignant routine

[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:50.640]
This this thing about her just it's just so typical like I said so so ridiculous and then this guy calls in this morning

[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.040]
The worst sir you don't know anything about the United States. You don't live in the United States

[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.920]
You live in date County which I hate to break the news to you and Robert Steinbach is not a part of the United States

[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:05.140]
It has not there is no relationship between date County and the US of Frekeny okay?

[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:13.380]
It is a fascist state operated by a bunch of corrupt fascists who know nothing about freedom who know nothing about anything

[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.040]
except okay, no except the where is it?

[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.420]
Okay said hysteria

[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.400]
That's all you know

[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:28.540]
And we're in we're like prisoners of it. We're like the victims of it. They just keep beating us over the head with it over and over again

[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:36.480]
Here's Boca hello. Yeah, Neil. Yeah, when you're not there in George takes over the show is so boring

[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:44.320]
This sounds like one of the hockey assholes to me. I mean yeah, I mean

[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.340]
How much river pay to make that call by the way sir?

[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.780]
The dead life, but I'm gonna say it again the day that Jeff Rimmer has a show on this radio station

[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:57.140]
We'll be the day that we start playing Hungarian and Mizzirka the other 23 and a half hours a day around his half-hour show

[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.300]

We'll take it personally and get pretending it all been under shape, but we'll still take the next free meal at Woods Chris

[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:29.880]

And what does that money go to it goes the castor?

[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:13.700]
Why don't you go down a mix and buy some real goods to guys and stop subsidizing the bearded one?

[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.680]
Hey, I'm telling you right now. I can afford those cheap cigar spots. We got on this station

[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:22.320]

[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.520]
Nothing moves these bastards

[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.680]
21 before 11 at 5 60 Q a.m

[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.000]
Okay, so Sam is in here disrupting me while I'm trying to get ready to do a show

[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.860]
17 that's okay. I'm not going to mention the fact that you're in here bugging me about the Nrique Glacias

[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.620]
If you got a thing for Nrique is that what it is?

[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.120]
Oh, I got a thing for Nrique. Well, I got a confused and I'm proud of it

[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.560]
And Rique a Glacias makes a crossover recording in English. It says after ruling Spanish speaking audiences for years in

[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:04.280]
Rique's territory of those spics now he's ready to cross over and talk to some real people

[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:09.640]
Eglacias sent a son of Kuno who washed up Kuno Julio will release his first English single

[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:15.800]
We dance in June the tune penned by the same team that wrote shares believe is already number one on south float is power 96

And jamming Johnny by the way jamming up your ass and tell a footied to the same while you're at it

[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.460]
Yeah, how can they make any money? How can they pay any erudgers with all our cheap cigar spots?

[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.600]
Maybe if everybody would buy their cigars down in Nixon instead of by noscohebas and subsidizing the bearded one

[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:42.980]
Then maybe we could the for they can afford to run lots more spots. I'm all quite last time. I heard they're doing pretty good down there last time I checked

[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:49.660]
5 6 7 0 5 boy. I'm telling you this is the deadest crowd this week. I don't know what George's into the audience

[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:58.280]

And I'm sick and tired damn cubans talking about fighting the war out of Halea. Yeah, the Cuba

[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.140]
If they want a fight of war get out there and both of them go home and fight. Yeah, you know

Yeah, you know if you don't got on the wrapping we're about to leave out with 14 men and he took the whole country over

[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.780]
So they need to do the same as up crying in America at one to send our boys to fight

[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:34.920]
Let me ask you this question sir. Did that baseball game involved him or last night affect your life in any way shape or form?

[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.100]
I've not even watched it. Excellent. Okay. God bless you. There's a real American for you right there

[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:45.320]
When it's not obsessed with all this Cuba crap we're tired of Cuba. Okay, we're sick and tired of it

[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:51.100]
I told you this before we're tired of old domino planned assholes and domino park. We're sick and tired of horse meat

[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.160]

[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.320]
What a jerk what a jackass all you experts out there just dying with your with your professional jealousy

[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:14.600]
It's just nauseating that we got so many little tiny people in this town. What are you upset about footy?

[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:19.500]
I've dianne magdom. She did a nice suck job on that piece. She did I knew there at channel 10 a few months ago there

[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:23.120]

Didn't do anything in that little pink car. Oh, you the only person I've heard this ever come out against that. Yeah

[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.060]
That is a disgrace out there, Neil

[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.940]
And now to share up this morning by the way says now all of a sudden

[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:53.080]
He's decided that there was at least one more shooter in there and they may have some more arrest coming

[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.080]
I don't need the guy that sold the kid to get their handgun

[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.540]
But now there may be some other people that were shooting it up and that there were too many weapons and too many of bombs

[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.340]
Etc. And now they're starting to rethink their position

[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.320]
I you know

[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:08.320]
They coming out there and I think out there in that part of the country that neck of the woods

[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.080]
They seem to have a lot of problem with law enforcement out there

[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:16.300]
Yeah, and and you know I love about Fox Network. I level me a third covering this story

[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:21.580]
I love how they do terror in the Rockies or show down the go and I love how they do that haunted house

[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:26.560]
You know how they're doing that like that haunted house font on the uh terror in the in the Rockies

[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:32.140]
If I'm a parent my kids been killed. Yeah, I mean, you know, I'm so outraged with Fox Network

[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:35.860]
It's like they packaged these in movies because you know you know

[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:41.220]
Get well Neil that the mini series is coming out next year. Mm-hmm. I mean this is really good here

[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:45.340]
I mean you're right Neil. It will be out in six months, bro. Why?

[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.040]
Incredible incredible and and no one's talking. I know and latches out nobody

[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:55.420]
We'll talk about anything nobody gets mad about a thing here like I told you before there's no passion and stuff

[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:57.180]
These people don't care about anything

[00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.840]
They're all sitting on their dead ass

[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.200]
Yeah, I give you an example when we were shooting

[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:08.680]
Nothing bad down just relax calm down. Okay, we've got to change the world with some stupid phone call on some stupid

[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:15.900]
You know, but especially here is what killed me is Neil more killed the fact that Baghdad you take a look at Baghdad

[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:20.520]
We're shooting up in Baghdad and CNN has got the box score of games at the bottom

[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:27.320]
There's something wrong with our society when we when we're showing people being blown out and then we can't not how about Belgrade

[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.180]
Was that the same thing? Yeah, okay. Have a great thing. Good amount

[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.480]
One call left on the board there baby and that's it then we can go to the music. Let's play

[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.720]
Myanis 400 times today, huh? That's my favorite. You got number one with four bullets

[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.060]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line

[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:49.740]
I'm wound up like an alarm clock these last two days coming back after vacation and this audience is better than ever

[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:53.540]
Looks like George drove the whole guy their audience away last their last week

[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.120]
I mean are these lines working seriously?

[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:01.600]
What kind of a show is this what kind of a place is this? What kind of a station is this that I'm on?

[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.920]
I think footies got a point when you come right down to it

[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:11.680]
5 6 and I go in two fast with these numbers 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line

[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.880]
Got all of these things going on here. We got a well plates

[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:19.240]
But it's just loaded. That's overflowing out. It's spilling off the edges here today

[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:24.920]
And just like yesterday only a hundred times worse a thousand times worse

[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:31.420]
A bunch of deadheads we got in this time. Oh sit there and entertainers deal sit there and scream and beg and put on your act and

[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.000]
pretend that people are going to call you and talk to you right

[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:39.440]
That's what we want to hear we're a bunch of a satist out here. We're like God. We're statistic

[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.120]
Here's Coral Springs. Hello. Hey, and you're welcome back. Oh, yeah, sure

[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:49.780]
A couple things I wanted to talk to you about did you buy any chance to see on the news that

[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:54.840]
One fanatical Cuban that ran on the field in the Empire Slandham down. Yes, picked him up and bought his land

[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.320]
I say good for him

[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:01.080]
The other thing was about the this whole thing with this lady who banned the cigar magazine

[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.200]
She came here when she was five

[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:10.160]
Yeah, she came here in 1962 37 years ago when she was five years old and she's an expert and how everything is over there right now

[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.800]
And she's all been out of shape and her whole life is you know

[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:19.620]
It's still still involved in this goddamn narrow limited crap this little crappy island down there and that's all she knows from

[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.340]
She's not a Cuban. She's an American. No, she's not

[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:26.000]
But I'm saying five years old. What do you remember about again?

[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.800]
She's a professional Cuban. We have professional Jews professional Cuban professional Africans this country is loaded with people who are

[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:37.840]
Professional you fill in the blank professional assholes and also in regard to the SWAT team

[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:38.980]
Just

[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.860]
Information from how I feel about it. Yeah

[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.240]
The reason they probably did not go in there is

[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:50.280]
You don't know they did obviously they did not know whether those kids were still alive

[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:55.600]
Had they stormed that building and those kids would have lost it and more rounds and killed ten more

[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.960]
But you're wrong. They already were in there. They went in there at about 1230

[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.900]
They were in there. They were like very cautiously and carefully going through with different rooms and so on and the only gunfire that was me

[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:08.120]
They were firing off their own protective rounds like the signal each other

[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.440]
There was no other gunfire going on because they the

[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:15.060]
Lunatics were dead. They already blown their brains out. Yeah, but they didn't know they were dead

[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.080]
Yeah, they didn't know

[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:22.340]
How many hours do you wait before you take a chance just in case somebody was there was the one time they put on the window

[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:27.200]
The kids help for bleeding to death in here and then there was the other kid that like dangled and got himself out the window

[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.160]
I mean how long do you wait before you start doing a job? I agree with you

[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:36.680]
But had they went in there too quickly? Yeah more people had gotten killed for some reason

[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:40.300]
That everybody would be up in arms right now that they stormed the building and they should have waited

[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:46.040]
So it's a double-edged sword. Yeah, go into fast and they get ridiculed for it. You go into slow and you get rid of too far

[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:52.040]
That's a good point. So and then the event tell that bitch you go back to Cuba. Okay. See you go back to Cuba

[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:52.520]
bitch

[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:58.200]
Whatever her name was myra boost the month. They go back. Okay. This is America and you're sitting there

[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:03.140]
You're leaving through the magazines and deciding for us what's gonna be on the newsstands over there my international airport

[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:08.640]
Where I happen to be a god damn good customer and by plenty of goddamn magazines and books at the newsstands in there by the way

[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:09.640]
Myra

[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:17.840]
Go back where you came from sweetheart 37 years ago and stop trying to be a little dictator because that's what that's what you know the best the people of your mentality

[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.800]
dictators little bitistas little sensors

[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.360]
WQ I am

[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.320]
Speaking

[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.100]
Last time I check

[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.480]
Okay, Neil let me ask you a question. How do you feel about um

[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:42.540]
Uh the gaming the Baltimore the the way they censored all the other signs and and the people fried in watch the game in Baltimore

[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.120]
So I didn't watch it. I didn't think we had to do what I couldn't care less about it

[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.680]
But I'm asking you don't you think that is

[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:56.880]
robbing Americans of the freedom robbing Americans of what freedom of freedom of expression freedom of expression for what

[00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:01.780]
Well for whatever reason if if I let's say if I would if if I go

[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.680]
So let me ask you this how did that ballgame affect your life? How does that affect any of our life?

[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:12.440]
That's not my question to you my question is do you think is right that they did not allow Americans to take in signs

[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:17.680]
But yet the communist Cubans that come from Cuba had all kinds of signs had all kinds of

[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:24.300]
Yes, I do. I think they had the absolute right to not not let people they they they stop people from taking all kinds of signs at ball games

[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.660]
Everywhere in America where

[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:31.340]
Well, because I don't know what do you mean where you can take you try to take us right into a Miami arena when a people were wanted

[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:36.300]
Brian Murray and and built a way to get fired let's ask how many people got those signs in the arena sir

[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.780]
You better wake up and shift of daffodils. Okay, mr

[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.440]
Like I said stuck with the same old tire with a one note man

[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.100]
Just like that now sandy paintings are like the 60 cycle tone just

[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.680]
That's it

[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.220]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line

[00:40:55.980 --> 00:41:00.560]
Give it a rest already forget about your stupid goddamn ballgame forget about your protest

[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:06.460]
Let me say it again. We don't care about Cuba. We don't care about Castro. We don't care about Cuba

[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:11.460]
We don't care about Guaya Barras. We don't care about the horse meat. We don't give a crap. We're sick and tired of it

[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.580]
We want to live in America

[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.080]
We don't want to be trapped with this a some kind of obsessive psychotic man

[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:23.640]
There comes a point when you have to start looking you know living where you are and not living in a god damn past like 37 years ago

[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:32.480]
That's just the way it is. Okay, and of course try to say that in this town. You might as well be farting into a windstorm into a tornado

[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.400]
Here's Miami. Hello

[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:42.500]
Hello, yes sir. Yeah, I'm a American born but Cuban heritage and I couldn't give a rat that's whether the game was on or not great

[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:51.520]
Um, and about that the police in that combine shooting. Yeah, the only other person I heard they what about the police was believe it or not child and husband

[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:56.560]
How do you like that? Because why does the police who ended up their job?

[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.460]
You son of a bitch exactly. Okay, sir. God bless you

[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.300]
Always like that charlotte and heston if we just took his toys away he'd be all right

[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:10.920]
Well, you know, he got that the god complex you know, he was in all those movies. He was Moses. He was Jesus. He was Abraham. He was a

[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.340]
A lot of things all these things

[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:20.760]
I mean somebody somewhere along the line is got it, you know, I'm the only one that said it and it's the god damn truth

[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.800]
This town is is it's like a bloodless cool was taken over here

[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:32.080]
And anybody in date county that dares to say anything opposite is crucified vilified come and listen and I call him out

[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:38.760]
I mean but I built the same old tired one note Johnny's okay wake up and get a freaking life. That's my message to you already

[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:46.220]
Until grandma and grandpa and all these other old stale senile parts tell them if they're so psychotic about it

[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:52.100]
Give them a water pistol and put them on a raft and send them back over there. Okay, and let them pee all over Castro

[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.160]
Whatever they want to do to them

[00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:04.240]
Nobody cares nobody gives a flying crap about some stupid ballgame and we get a guy under the age of a hundred that calls in on this radio station this morning on the Jolyne

[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.440]
The big old boy showing the morning

[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:12.060]
It's got the audacity to say this was the worst insult the and it's not just the fact that the game was played

[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.420]
The fact that the Orioles had the audacity to get beat

[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.580]
Which they got plenty of practice at by the way since they suck and the Orioles only kissed the ground that the marlins exist

[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:29.440]
To make them look not quite so bad because for the wild earth the were Orioles had an even worse record by a gamer to then the marlins

[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.820]
Up until they last you a when the marlins really put it into low gear big time

[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:42.560]
Anybody want to buy any marlin spots? No, anybody want to advertise on a marlin. How about them cheat cigars plays at marlins, huh?

[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.540]
Maybe footy would like to buy some spots on a marlin game. No since he's the radio expert

[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:53.380]
Maybe why would a hundred would like to broadcast those games and pay walledy millions and millions of dollars a year

[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:58.480]
Three and a half million dollars a year to broadcast the game a team that won't win 50 games this year. No

[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:04.140]
Let's build a stadium come on

[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.700]
Build it and they will come

[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.300]
Squirt-squirt I think they'll come anyway

[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.460]
1056 and 560 WQM if you

[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.860]
Damn get away and feel the release

[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:25.700]
Smell the fresh sea air

[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:31.140]
Taking the unparalleled experience of Cuban rafting on big latitude

[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:34.960]
It's like a vacation away from your troubles

[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.080]
Your life back home

[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.200]
Your the skipper on a journey to a better place

[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:47.160]
The only thing between you and your destination is whenever nature has planned for you that day

[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:48.980]
Unpredictable

[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:50.640]
Grand taking

[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.380]
Life threatening

[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.240]
Cuban rafting on big latitude

[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.880]
Will your way to something better

[00:44:58.900 --> 00:44:59.840]
Roll faster

[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.180]
No faster here come the shark scatter on much faster than that

[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.320]
Road damage

[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:10.240]
painful brother you wish neighbor and by the way speaking of inconsistency and phoniness is that interesting

[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:14.280]
How was the wonderful glorious thing and the media were actually like a bragging about it

[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:19.460]
Oh Joe Kubas was there in a couple other agents are there ready to sign up these guys and try to spirit them away, you know

[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.900]
miserable exploiting piece of lying turd Joe Kubas

[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:30.280]
Oh, yeah, well, it just happened to have a cell phone. They just have to happen to know exactly where to meet him

[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.160]
You know, yeah, right

[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.600]
That was great, but the fact that they were here in the first place that was bad

[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:40.880]
Can anybody explain that to me? No, even Desi Arnez with that trouble explaining that no

[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:46.560]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. I could tell you one way

[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:51.820]
The baseball game effectively. I live here in Little Havanna, Cuban center unfortunately

[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:55.080]
And they started closing down all the streets because of protests. So

[00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:02.720]
They were closing the streets down. Yeah, all these streets you couldn't get out. I guess we're bombed right there something here. Oh great

[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:08.100]
Beautiful. Oh, yeah, I hate living in this area and another thing make out when I'm out at Oloquano

[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.200]

[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:18.500]
He takes a giant crap on the mothers of all of the Cubans. Okay, five six seven and by the way don't do it in the train though

[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:24.660]
Unless it's moving five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless landed. He's saying me Erda

[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:29.880]
Here's a mobile in the cross-spring. Hello. How you doing? Okay, sir? This is getting very upsetting

[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.820]
What's that the Cubans they don't want us to read magazines?

[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.320]
They don't want us to go to baseball games

[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:39.980]
And then there's this crazy guy earlier this year was trying to burn down this game by because he didn't want

[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:45.100]
A game are open. I mean I'm tired of these people I'm very sensitive to their problems

[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:48.920]
But they shouldn't they have the right what what are the problems you said your version of

[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:55.420]
What they feel if they feel heard about Cuba I feel I feel bad. Well, wouldn't you make me feel heard about it?

[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:59.060]
What does that mean? Well, I don't understand this one. Let me ask you this sir

[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:03.780]
Where would you rather be living right now in Havana Cuba or in the United States? 49 states of course

[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:08.980]
So what's the problem? The problem is how you think all of you this block is all the Albanians feel right now

[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:13.400]
You think they'd rather be living over there in the US the point is I don't want them to tell us what book three

[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:19.480]
What what the games to go to what to think what to say yeah, um, they come here and they try try to act more like communist

[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:23.980]
The communist fascist, sir. You don't understand fascisty. That's what they know that's what they know from

[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:28.840]
That's that's what the Tista was all about. He was the number one grade a world champion world class fascist

[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:33.100]
And that's what they think freedom's all about. Well, that's not what they're like communism. They love fascism

[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:36.720]
Well, let's let's get a little freedom here. Okay. Well, I'll see you in Broward

[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.500]
I'll say like I said I'll see in Palm Beach. I'll see it in the Martin County

[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.440]

[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.020]
They will put up with this for a two seconds

[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.460]
Five say what are you smarting about it? So God damn truth

[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.240]
They all agree on all the same stuff

[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:03.580]
They're all right winged. They'll make it done make any different people it doesn't make any difference

[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.880]
They speak English in Jacksonville. Do you understand you get it? I understand you get it mister

Hello, yes, sir. Hi Neil. How are you? Great good

[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:25.720]
You know some these people that are poor

[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:32.860]
What's everybody's attention the problem with the guards efficient. I don't should have just realized that if they would have said nothing

[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.700]
You know, it's just been another monthly issue of another boy magazine

[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:43.220]
And then this way they wouldn't have gotten god only knows what type of publicity for the magazine on front page of all the newspapers down here

[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:49.200]
And to cause all the stir if they would not have said anything and just let it go in the back the back rack of the airport

[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:50.920]
New stand

[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:56.720]
Nothing what I didn't have to be on the back rack. Why could it be in the same spot wherever that magazine always sit?

[00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:59.920]
Okay, what business is any individual over there? I'm in a lot of here

[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.900]
I want to say something okay what business does one individual have

[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.480]
any magazine

[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:11.260]
Wait, okay, you don't want to have a conversation you're rooting up not just you make me sick

[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.020]
How come he couldn't let me finish his sentence

[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.360]
That's what Ted Bundy asked

[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:21.580]
5 6 7 0 I just I don't have any patience for people like that when you call a talk

[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:25.820]
Shoulder's gonna be a give it a take a ying and a yang and in and out and up and it down and that's the way it works

[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:28.860]

Here's a pember pine. Hello

[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:46.500]
Yeah, no you already tell you what affected me about this this whole idea about the baseball game. What was that okay?

[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:51.080]
An example, okay, I'm out of your Toronto man. Maybe leaves

[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:55.760]
Went to play Hitler's team. I mean we're all aware of what it is

[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:58.060]
What sir Toronto Maple Leafs didn't go to play Hitler's team

[00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:04.480]
But they did have the goddamn Olympics in in 1936 in Germany and the world continued spinning around how do you like that?

[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.960]
Well, Neil is just an example. I mean, I would do you know what I would do?

[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:14.160]
Well, yes, I'm going to play because Hitler's dead in the ground. Okay, so you bring up they bring it up some ridiculous hypothetical

[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.940]
Example it has nothing to do with anything

[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:21.920]
But how would you feel if knowing what he did to the new community? Sir, let me say it to you again, okay?

[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:28.780]
Nobody here in this country gives a flying crap about Castro. Can't you understand that he's not doing anything to this country

[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:35.300]
Nobody here cares about him and to put him in a same category with Hitler is typical of people your mentality. Okay, sir. You're wasting my time

[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:45.260]
5 6 7 0 5 60 palm 5 60. Oh, yeah, they're taking all the people away to concentration camps. Aren't they? Yeah, right. Sure. They are

[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:59.860]
Or if they would just put on the right uniforms that would make it even nicer wouldn't so then you couldn't identify anybody

[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:05.520]
At least the trench coats they stood out a little bit. They had some some hell of a chance to find out who the hell they were

[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:11.520]
Putting an outfit on somebody putting them in a uniform trying to make them go step

Okay, um, well, there's and so many mentioned that um Dennis Wilson didn't even play on the beach boys

[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:31.780]

And there's Paul Simon where have you gone Joe to measure and a crowd goes nuts even though we know

[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:10.560]
Then he already said that he just stuck it in there because it fit in middle lyrics, okay?

[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.080]
And

[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:18.540]
And that Joe to measure didn't like it in the first place because he was too stupid to understand it that it was a faunting

[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:24.100]
It was a complimentary and he didn't understand it. Oh, I haven't gone anywhere. What are you talking about?

But he's dead anyway five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T line. Here's the mobile in Miami. Hello

[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.800]

That's what I always expect in this time

[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.620]
Well, George is pretty good. I like him when he's in. I just need to stay away from the religion. That's all

[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:45.700]
He just needs to be able to go for the juggler like you when they start something at Bible Adam

[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.620]
I just wanted to give you a little spy report

[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:14.040]
You got a fast hand out of here. He got his ass uh blown out

[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.160]

[01:02:54.740 --> 01:03:00.080]
That was pretty good 80 shows. He did the show on 80s like a retro show. We had a bunch of music and stuff good

[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.260]
He killed an hour pretty good. Good. Excellent

[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:06.700]
I think that's a good idea. We'll start doing that right now. So now I finished this call

[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.280]
And footy in those it takes it six suck

My wife's an American Cuban doesn't care about the game and can't call somebody a douchebag

[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:38.340]
56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, Daniel. Okay. I'm an American and I care about what's going on in Cuba

[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:43.040]
Just because the sooner cash crew drops dead and they get their stuff together down there. Mm-hmm

[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.000]
All these Cubans will go back and let me talk about why I hate to break the news

[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.240]
Yes, sir, but when he drops dead nothing is gonna change

[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:52.540]
You're healthy right? I know I know you are a change

[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:58.600]
Whatever case people are gonna be screaming the same sour long boring note from now until the end of time

Never gonna stop. So we're stuck with him. You were stuck. I'll see you in Martin County then. Okay. Thanks

[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:17.140]
Okay, I'm not gonna play this game that this audience evidently takes great delight in doing

[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.580]
I'm not gonna play the game. It's pointless

[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:23.360]
We got all these different things going on here, which all affect our everyday goddamn life here in this town

[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:28.740]
We're prisoners of a goddamn mentality plus all the other stuff going on with the shootings and everything else

[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:33.380]
We got the little girl in school by the way the 13-year-old girl that got arrested because she's written

[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:39.360]
Yeah, she was plotting it then attack at her school because she saw it on a TV this other thing in little didn't so hey, that's a good idea

[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:45.000]
13-year-old girl was planning an elaborate attack on a list of students and authority figures at her school

[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.860]
Blair a bare middle school in sunrise was arrested later that night

[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:52.300]
Whatever the hell night. This is what's the story doesn't bother saying by the way

[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:57.200]
Charged and sent to the juvenile intake facility in Fort Lauderdale 13-year-old girl

[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:03.280]
So even little girls now are making all the plans thinking about and get their guns and make their bombs

[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.180]
into their things

[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.940]
Zined-America baby

[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.760]
560-505-60-505-60 on the AT&T line

[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:13.960]
It's safe

[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.880]
In Miami Town

[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:21.220]
At 560-WQ-A-L

[01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:26.220]
The following is a paid public service announcement from the International Rites Association

[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:32.380]
Let's face most of us will never be rich. Hell, we probably won't even be successful and that's pretty damn depressed

[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:35.900]
But as usual with every problem there is a solution

[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:39.540]
Hi, I'm Jim and I'm here to tell you a little something about handgun

[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:44.160]
They scare the s*** out of people and intimidate them and giving you whatever you want

[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:48.000]
That's right handguns think about it. Need some cash?

[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:53.920]
Rub a bank. Don't have enough money for beer. All of the convenience takes chips and pretzels wire at

[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.240]
It's all free if you've got a handgun

[01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:59.480]
Some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend kill him

[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:02.240]
The simple solution to life's complex problems

[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:06.320]
All I have to do is wait the five days for it and happiness is just around the corner

[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.060]
Well, if you don't want to wait the five days who cares?

[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:12.840]
Buy the dancing of the street just buy a lot of handguns

[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:16.720]
It's a great alternative to working problems out and be considered a population control

[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:20.020]
Yes handguns. They just might make you think

[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.780]
Okay, it's 1131 at 560 WQ-A-L

[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:27.780]

[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:46.160]
Neil yes sir good morning. Oh, are you okay?

[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:53.600]
Listen as Latina. I am very ashamed of how the Cuban community conducts himself down here

[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:58.140]
Uh, I think they have a hell of a lot more calls like this sir. That's the thing that really tears my gut

[01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:02.800]
Is that we don't have a hell of a lot more calls just like the one you're making right now seems they don't remember

[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:09.640]
That they're elected government officials in Cuba like preo or the people that they help put in power like Batista

[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:15.840]
And then they come to this country and still and uh, you like the same kind of people to be

[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:22.980]
In the one the government down in Miami. That's why the government now in Miami. So messed up as everybody nationwide knows

[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:28.880]
And then to ruin not only the county to ruin the whole state they help select

[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.940]
ELEC and put in the governor's dimension

[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:37.580]
Religious sell it another fascist another right wing fascist. This is the mentality you're dealing with I mean

[01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:41.080]
I guess they don't remember that I plus I mean

[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.120]
But a philo has killed this you know has done this Batista did the same thing

[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:50.300]
Under the blessing of the US just the different groups of people that's all you know

[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:54.440]
And Neil what gets me is Batista did it under the blessing of the US government

[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:58.740]
As everybody should know by now is just that they are upset

[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:03.260]
Because all these Cubans that live in Havana and let me tell you this

[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:07.720]
I think there were about three or four stories in Havana because every Cuban I know they're from Havana

[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:14.980]
Have you ever noticed that yeah, and they all have sugar plantations because they couldn't bring their money and the sugar plantations over here

[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:20.000]
They all under own casino too. I think uh-huh. Okay. Have a good day Neil. I'll read it out

[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:27.500]

Let's move on to things that have something to do with our life with some stupid vulgar in Baltimore last night did not okay did not

[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:42.140]
Here's a lady in Cooper City. Hello. Hi, Uncle Neil. How are you? Okay. I'd love to change its subject to something more attractive and

[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:47.660]
Certainly uh something more interesting. I got a cable accident last night. Yeah, I

[01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:55.280]
I think it was MTV or VH one. I saw somebody. I don't know. I've never heard of him before Ricky Martin. Oh my goodness

[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:58.820]

[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:19.980]
Ricky Martin and don't ask me why he is he's undergone several makeovers and

[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:29.680]
You know what you see is the finished product of that. Oh real well. It's not so bad. Yeah. I was very impressed and I you know and every song that he sings sounds exactly the same

[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:30.800]
I mean exactly

[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.900]
La Vida loca and

[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:38.020]
Hey, I'm sure why and he's got that other one from the other world cup soccer thing

[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.840]
Er, they all sound the same. I mean, you know if you like the way he looks that's fine

[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:42.920]
He does look pretty good right now

[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:47.660]
But if you had that much work done you'd look great too. You know what I'm saying? Oh, this is about his fifth makeover

[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:52.920]
I've never heard of him, but I knew that you you know, you kind of knew you know, no, I know

[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.440]

It's nip with the tongue excuse me

[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:08.120]
Um, anyway, just I believe me. He ain't available. You know what I'm saying? Oh, don't get too excited because you're not his type

[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.860]
Okay, never never mind. You know who you are

[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.460]
Okay as long as you know of the opposite

[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:21.980]
persuasion is not looking too bad anyway, um, you know, can I get a shameless request? Sure. Can I hear freeway and spikus?

Okay, thanks. Bye. Have a great day. Well, that's good. She changes subject to some other spik. That's good

[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:27.820]
Ricky Martin

[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:30.480]
We're just talking about that off the air this morning before the show

[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.340]
I don't know what the hell all of a sudden happened man, but it like I told him before

[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.480]
Talon has got very little to do with anything

[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:40.940]
It's strictly the marketing. He was hanging around for a long time. He was on tele hit

[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:44.160]
He was on a Mexican channel there. He was on the Latin American channels

[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.840]
Nobody knew from him anywhere in the world all of a sudden they gave him about the tenth makeover

[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:53.860]
They put him on all those Puerto Rico promotional spots on tv and they had him at the Grammys and now he's bigger than

[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:54.980]
Mary Tyler Moore

[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:59.380]
He's bigger than life itself. Like I said about mention a half

[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:05.940]
Ricky Martin and airy song sounds exactly the same as the previous one airy single god damn one

[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.020]
Do I have to think that no I don't thank god

[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:13.820]
What's always the name of that? I just felt about the Ramamaria. No, no

[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:16.580]
That the one that was the big one from the the World Cup

[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.640]
Like Kupade la Vida

[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.120]
Leave it to me to come up with crap like that like Kupade la Vida

[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.700]
They all sound the same

[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:30.080]
All the same and they're just obsessed with Ricky Martin

[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:37.900]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 out of 18 T wireless line. Here's a lady mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, man

[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:43.300]
Yes, hello Neil boy you're having a hard time today. Yes, I am just like yesterday. Oh, yeah

[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.860]
Can we go back to the

[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:48.780]
The Garne magazine for a minute going out to anything you want?

[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:55.440]
Okay, she was upset because she looked through it and it upset her because her family wasn't living like that. Uh-huh

[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.140]
Okay

[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:56.880]
Uh

[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:03.420]
Every time I look through house beautiful. I realize I don't live like that. You don't and every time I look through play girl

[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:07.800]
I realize my husband don't look like that right and come to think of it when I look at play boy

[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:13.380]
I don't look like that. Oh, no, so what do I do? I mean do I start? I guess we got to play banding

[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:18.640]
We got to start getting all these magazines off the shelves because it might make somebody feel bad terribly depressing

[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.440]
Uh-huh. I mean if you if you have play girl and you and you better understand

[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:29.940]
This is the mentality that so many of these people have been raised with the idea that freedom is as long as it does is not offensive to you

[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:35.120]
Then it's okay. That's what freedom is all about and uh, well, what's the chance for the rest of us?

[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.960]
I remember being in New York in the late 60s and pro-

[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.520]
Being involved in the Hiroshima Nagasaki

[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:46.400]
Remembering stays and the protests up there and there were Cubans and Puerto Ricans up there then

[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:52.080]
That were angry and by the way you made a comment. They were angry about what they were angry about anybody protesting

[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.740]
Against America they consider it to be on American well

[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.520]
Excuse me, but I thought protests was American

[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:05.160]
Only if you only if you agree with their viewpoint and you also made a comment that in Jackson and by the way emperor

[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.380]
Here are hedo didn't have the same slide on things as for them

[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:14.860]
You said Jackson though. They don't speak Spanish. They you know, they have red necks. I got news for you

[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:17.460]
There's a lot of Cubans in Jackson. Oh

[01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:21.240]
Unfortunately like I said planes George ain't that far up the road

[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:22.520]
Yeah, and in closing

[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:27.460]
One thing that George said last week that I have written down and I'm going to use my motto from now on

[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:32.280]
He was talking about the choose life bumper thing right and he said it should be get a life

[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:36.420]
Okay, and I like that. Okay. I'll see you in a tree. Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye

[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:42.240]
I'll tell you one thing a tree start to look a lot better now in your own retrospect a little kid up there with a banjo in the tree

[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.760]
I think he may have had a pointer to

[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:48.760]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:56.640]
I'm full of piss and vinegar

[01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:03.220]
Full of energy and come back to another dead-ass place every it's a same old tired crap

[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:08.960]
If you're suffering from hair loss you got an embarrassing ball spot and you're getting sick and tired looking at that thing in the mirror

[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:13.660]
Why not do something positive about it? Call my good friend Charles Alfieri over 25 years ago

[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.040]
This is the guy who created the best hair system in the universe

[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:20.900]
Which is why even multi-millionaires got their hair system from Charlie because no matter how much money they had

[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:23.780]
They couldn't look better than he could make him with the natural hairline system

[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:27.900]
And this is sunny Fox and I listen to your Rogers cuz I can hear the word asshole turns about

The most important part freeway from the pro tech label

[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:35.420]
Pro tech huh? I'm so in dorm by the city council of San Francisco

[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:08.980]
S&B

[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:20.720]
Don't doubt know what it's all about the pro tech

[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:23.120]
So they won't send you a

[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:29.940]
Pro tech condoms

[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:35.800]
Why do these guys keep doing this? I mean, why don't they do what I suggested that you should go out and try to sell spots on a Marling game

[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:41.640]
The method just comes in your hands this thing. Why do they keep doing this? What is the point?

[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:43.160]
The bit it to me last week, too

[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.220]

[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:19.880]
Here's Miami. Hello

[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.700]
Hello, yes, sir. Oh, yes

[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:30.180]
Neil I'm a Cuban guy and this is the first time that I tried to get in your program. Yes, sir

[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:35.440]
Listen, first of all, re-marking it used to be one of the menudals the re-enactors. That's right

[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:42.960]
I have to talk about the the baseball game and I'm not a fanatic believe me, but let me tell you I always said

[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:52.420]
What happened if a hitler sent a group of players to Miami Beach? I want you to tell me if the US people are going to allow to

[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:55.640]
Are going to allow them to do it. This is my first point

[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.540]
I just want why

[01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:02.640]
Fidel Castro can do everything here. Let me ask you this question. Are we at war with Cuba? I'm sorry

[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.620]
Our is the United States at war with Cuba

[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.680]
If we are on war

[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.400]
Hello, let me say it again

[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:17.680]
Are we at war with Cuba last time you checked? Are we having some kind of a military conflict with Fidel Castro with Cuba? He does we don't

[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:23.300]
Well, he does he does what? Yeah, well he though he feels he married everybody believe and he'd read

[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:28.300]
I'm not talking about believe. I'm talking about are we fighting a war or are we at war with Cuba sir?

[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:32.580]
I'm not interested in some pseudo intellectual some abstract. I'm talking about real life

[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:36.120]
I'm talking about the right that we have to protest my friend

[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:41.020]
Are we the only thing that we did we no no you wait a minute you started out with a premise about Hitler okay?

[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.260]
Let's say it again. We're not at war with Cuba right

[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.120]
Well, okay, but are we he credit that already right?

[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:55.400]
Tell me if a group of Nazis can come to South Beach or any further are Nazis who speak in

[01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:01.440]
Skokie, Illinois and who speak in various parts of this country and get permits to speak all the time in this country

[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:02.900]
Yes, yes, they do okay

[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:08.520]
You know what happened with Vanessa. Greg Ray was going to sing in this culture and they cancel it. Yeah, okay

[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:12.840]
So so is that right? Well, but why then why did why this

[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:18.820]
What did I say which is awful standard? I'm not gonna get into a screaming match with people like you okay?

[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:24.940]
I'm not gonna waste my energy. It's not a double standard things get censored in this town all the time all the time

[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:29.960]
And 99% of the time by people of your ilk who don't want to understand what freedom is

[01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:38.160]
And whether it's being done by Cubans or fanatical Jews or who's doing it? It's on American. It's unacceptable. Got it. I'm sure you don't

[01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:41.420]
But he's not fanatic thank god for that

[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:48.140]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line and like I said we had the one guy that called

[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:51.900]
We should have every line on this board filled up. We got all these Julio's listed out there

[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:57.860]
But they got nothing to say the cats got their tongue. They don't want it. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe not maybe they all feel the same way as this guy did

[01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:58.940]
Which is very sad

[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:04.620]
It was a stupid goddamn baseball game nobody cares. Don't you understand sir?

[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:12.840]
And what you also don't understand just like the woman with a cigar fishing out of magazine this obsession this hysteria

[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:17.600]
You know like like how many times have we seen magazines with a picture of Hitler on the cover?

[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.160]
Thousands of times

[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:29.480]
Do they take the magazine off the newsstand because Hitler's picture was on the cover? I don't think so or Stalin no

[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:37.760]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line here's Hollywood. Hello

[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.100]
Hollywood

[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.280]
Yes, hello. Yes, I am

[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:54.100]
The last night was a final episode of Noes arc and at the end of the end of the series they had a discussion on where Noes arc is

[01:20:54.840 --> 01:21:01.640]
How long are we going to perpetuate this idiocy if for 50 years they

[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:08.460]
They said it was on some mountain in Turkey. Can you imagine if it was really true the Pope would buy Turkey

[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:14.200]
And maybe he would like to chicken better than Turkey. Put a fence around it and I really like chicken. I am

[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:17.260]
Yeah, okay. Thank you sir. Whatever you're saying. I have another drink

[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:22.540]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line. They're just not gonna call

[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:29.860]
They're just not gonna say anything. Okay, so the stereotype and the device of this and the same kind of resentment that always is going on it

[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:30.860]
It's never gonna end

[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:37.380]
Because they don't have the balls they don't have the cajon to open up a mouth and say this is a bunch of crap

[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:41.540]
And we're not part of the same mentality and let's move on with life. They just don't have the balls to say it

[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:45.000]
All these good macho guys out there. Well, you know, we know you're listening

[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:47.240]
pathetic

[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:53.860]
Here's a mobile and kindle. Hello. They need how you doing? Okay. Yeah, I want to go to the match because I don't give a damn

[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:58.320]
Yeah, okay, I bought that based walking but I do have two comments. Yes, sir on the Ricky Martin

[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:04.480]
Please name two other songs that sound the same instead of the visa milk and a couple moon via I mean

[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:09.840]
Yeah, all budget signs are sound different. So I don't know what other songs do sound of signs for you

[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:15.400]
You know what I mean? Well other songs the last the last two are like I mean carbon copy

[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.580]
Okay, they are but you know and again

[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:22.000]
What do you know this guy has surgery this guy has always been a pretty boy since day one

[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:27.120]
There's always been the same if you remember some in noodle and conscience guy I've got old

[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.160]
I know I know what he looked like. Yeah, okay

[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:31.220]
But he's never had surgery. So I don't know what you get off thing

[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:32.460]
I didn't say he had surgery

[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:36.740]
I said that he had like makeovers like they died his hair and they like I didn't say surgery

[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:42.200]
Okay, yeah, when you get old and start drooping. That's when they do the surgery. He's too young to have to do that yet

[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:46.560]
Yeah, he's a pretty boy. Yeah, but you know whatever and another comment when you

[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:50.680]
Live in a separate for a long time every time he comes in team. He also work on planes

Yeah, how you doing great?

[01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:03.640]
Yeah, I grew up in South Florida. I lived here since 54. Yeah, and I would like to address this to as you so lovingly call them

[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:10.520]
The professional sticks that call your show. Mm-hmm. I've never seen a more gutless bunch of people in my entire life

[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:16.200]
Yeah, these are the people that you decided to fight for their country by kicking up and hauling ass

[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:21.000]
As fast as they could out of Cuba right when Castro took over if you look at

[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:21.940]
Correct

[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:29.680]
If you look at other places if you look at Palestine if you look at northern island where there's conflict that the Irish hall asks out of Ireland

[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:33.440]
No, they stayed there and they fought the English for centuries the Palestinians now

[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.840]
They fought for centuries

[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:43.220]
These people the very first minute that Castro takes over what do they do they haul ass here and they want us to go fight their damn battles for

[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:48.340]
They can go straight to hell as far as I'm concerned and this country has long enough and purgatory

[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:58.560]
No way no goes to hell. Okay. Not pass go do not collect $200. Okay, and this country has long enough calculated to God damn much of their foreign policy

[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:06.240]
To appease the professional sticks down here and and kiss their ass because the Republican party sold out to them

[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:10.760]
Okay, other than other than that, I think they're wonderful people and have a great thing you do

[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.200]

Who's whatever it is that they just got nothing to say

[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:27.060]
And by their silence they just continue this guy like he's pissed off and fired up and I understand then

[01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:32.580]
And I'm pissed off and fired up too. I'm sick of it. It's coming out of every poor my body the same old tired garbage

[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:39.520]

If they're so pissed off about it, why are they lending 10 double support by watching it?

[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.160]
Jesus Christ and Mary man

[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:36.020]
About all the people that went up there to wherever the hell they were playing

[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:43.540]
If they're so concerned about their brothers and sisters and whatever in Cuba. Yeah, take that money by food by clothing

[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:45.020]
instead of flying to

[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:50.500]
Up the east whatever the hell yeah, and and send some of these people

[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:55.340]
Some help they're already doing that under undercover. They're taking their send and plenty over there

[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:58.580]
Well, whatever that's all I have to say is long. Okay. Have a great thing sir

[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:03.060]
As long as we don't know about it then it's okay because you know then it's a little double standard there

[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:08.100]
But we're slipping it all under covers five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line

[01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:13.960]
Let me say it again after today after the day. I'm drawing the line. Okay. I never want to hear the word again in my life

[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:17.220]
I don't want to hear Cuba. I don't want to hear Castro. I don't want to hear it again

[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:20.800]
Call up Radio Mom B they went through the roof here in this last book

[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.560]
All this horsecraft about assimilation and about the you just look at the radio ratings in here

[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:30.140]
Radio Amor and radio mom B. Oh, I mean Jesus Christ already

[01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:34.860]
How many decades have to go by before finally some people start getting with a goddamn program

[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:38.720]
Huh? How many centuries have to go by?

[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:41.720]
How many millennia have to go by

[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:49.580]
In Georgian cyst by the way that the next millennium don't start till 2001. Don't be peeing on our parade. Okay

[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.780]
We don't want to hear the facts. We want we got things all planned so don't be screwing around with it

[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:58.800]
Always got to be one guy confusing people with the facts

[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:00.700]
Which we don't like

[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.000]
Look what happened to god damn Galileo for crying out loud

[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:10.080]
That's right you better learn your lesson man. But public it after you're a little spic ass

[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:14.900]
Nine minutes past noon at 560 WQM you know that those at the door

[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:20.200]
Even loves new rod it's your one of the millions of people who've been praying to hear the Pope singing on his own CD

[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:25.700]
Your prayers have been answered now through a special arrangement with a Vatican is holding this is back

[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:29.320]
And he's singing better than ever on the Pope's sing

[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:42.200]
Yes, it's Pope John Paul the second singing songs that will lift you up and make you get down

[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:00.820]
Lay down and poke and play that organ music to the eyes

[01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:07.720]
Which might be so the Pope sings get you the chance to hear the many sides of the owner of the Pope reveal

[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:17.040]
He's a part of and on this CD he's a bot

[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:20.340]
This should be playing finger

[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:21.540]
Oh

[01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:25.240]

Sixteen

[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:46.840]
Oh, I'm 22.

[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:48.780]
Wait a minute, chief.

[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:49.760]
So, a whole thing.

[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:52.540]

[01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:57.860]
Pro 15 at $5.60 WQM.

[01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.340]
So, anyway, here's a meaningful fact.

[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:02.960]
Finally, please share Magic 102.7's ratings with us.

[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:04.960]
Well, that's good.

[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.500]
I mean, I understand that there are people in the business

[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:07.180]
that they lied to you.

[01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:08.360]
They won't tell you what the numbers are.

[01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:10.920]
2554, that's their demo.

[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.840]
Persons 2554, morning drive.

[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.100]
They went from a 2.5 in a fall book to a 3.

[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:16.820]
In the winter book.

[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:19.420]
Midday, 3.4 to a 3.5.

[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:21.320]
afternoon drive, 4.1 to a 4.

[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:22.960]
Not bad.

[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:23.800]
All the way around.

[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:24.160]
There you go.

[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:26.200]
There's your Magic numbers for an extra charge.

[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:28.840]
You know, all around the rest of the country,

[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.980]
people are talking about kids blowing each other up

[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:33.280]
and shooting each other in schools.

[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:36.160]
We got a 13-year-old girl in sunrise

[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.980]
who was trying to get together with a bunch of her little

[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:39.740]
girlfriends and blow up their school.

[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:43.740]
Eighth grade Hollywood resident, also, by the way,

[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:47.180]
all across the country, schools that all levels

[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:49.260]
have experienced a rash of bomb threats

[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:51.320]
and other violence since the 20th of April,

[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:52.500]
since the shootings in Colorado.

[01:38:53.540 --> 01:38:54.820]
We got Yugoslavia.

[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:56.920]
We got a million Albanians that have been displaced.

[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:59.120]
We got Jesse Jackson grandstaining over there

[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.600]
trying to run American foreign policy,

[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:02.600]
telling us that Milosevic is a hell of a good guy.

[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:04.400]
And in South Florida, what are we talking about?

[01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:06.340]
The same old tired crap.

[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.040]
That's exactly my point.

[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:09.960]
That's right, you're busy jerking it off.

[01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:10.720]
That's what you're doing.

[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:14.720]
Same old tired garbage that you've been wasting our time with

[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:16.940]
for the last 30, 40 years now on

[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:18.400]
and like a stuck goddamn record.

[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:20.220]
That's why a lot of us are sick and tired

[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:21.780]
and nauseated and fed up with it.

[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:22.840]
We're puking from it.

[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:27.240]
While rational people are worried about important things

[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:28.520]
that have to do with our lives,

[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:32.080]
you're still clinging to the same old tired hysterical

[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:33.720]
thing that you're doing.

[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:36.680]
And by the way, how come so many are running around

[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:38.780]
with the flag of a communist country on your car?

[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.220]
Here's Hi Alia.

[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:42.460]
Hello.

[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:43.380]
Hello.

[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:43.960]
Yes sir.

[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:45.360]
Yes, I'm Michel Niel.

[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:51.860]
I am Cuban and you know what amazed me is the American.

[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:54.140]
They don't know facts.

[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:58.160]
And I let me ask where the last guy that called you,

[01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:01.500]
he said, we were protecting and watching the games.

[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:04.520]
Let me tell you, we love those players.

[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:06.080]
We don't hate the players.

[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:08.540]
We hate what Fidel Castro is doing.

[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:10.360]
The manipulation of the whole thing,

[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:13.420]
because everybody thinks that Fidel Castro is a nice guy.

[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:17.060]
No, no, sir, there is nobody who thinks that Fidel Castro is a nice guy.

[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:20.020]
See, that's an insult to the intelligence of people all over the world.

[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:22.560]
There is in anybody who thinks Fidel Castro is a nice guy.

[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:25.940]
Except the people in Cuba have been brainwashed for the last 40 years.

[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:27.560]
Many of them think he's a nice guy.

[01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:29.620]
Other than that, there is nobody outside Cuba

[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:31.000]
that doesn't know exactly what he is.

[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:31.900]
Okay, let me tell you.

[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:35.560]
In other words, because they came and played a baseball game in Baltimore,

[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.500]
you really believe that people are that stupid.

[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:39.060]
They think that he's a nice guy now.

[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:42.800]
Well, just because we're supposed to believe that Milosevic gave the three prisoners

[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.180]
to Jesse Jackson, that we believe he's a nice guy.

[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:46.880]
Of course, I understand what you're saying.

[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:47.780]
But let me finish.

[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:49.880]
Then about we send in money,

[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:54.120]
last year we sent $100 million to our family.

[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:57.100]
What happened is this, we send the dollars to Fidel Castro,

[01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:59.820]
get the dollars and pay our family with Cuban pesos.

[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:01.880]
So we are trapped.

[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.480]
We are between a rock and a hard place.

[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:06.240]
And again, we want to go and fight.

[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:10.100]
But this government, they don't allow us to go and fight Castro out of the country.

[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:12.140]
We don't even want to be here, my friend.

[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:13.060]
You don't want to be here.

[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.080]
No, no, I will.

[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:14.520]
I will.

[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:15.760]
I don't want to be here.

[01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:16.540]
Where would you rather be?

[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:18.020]
Would you rather be like a Dominican Rally?

[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:18.720]
How about in Haiti?

[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:19.540]
No, Cuba.

[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:20.000]
In Cuba.

[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:20.860]
In Cuba.

[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:21.640]
Why is that?

[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:23.800]
Because I'm Cuban and I love my country.

[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.280]
But I was kicked out of my country.

[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:29.200]
What about all the other refugees that came here from Ireland?

[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:32.500]
Like the guy said before and from Russia and from Germany and all over Western Europe.

[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:34.160]
How about all those people that came here?

[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:35.880]
The millions and millions and millions of them?

[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:38.260]
Are any of those people fighting to go back where they came from?

[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:39.700]
No, they can't.

[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:42.240]
If you want to go out, you ought to set the phone down right now.

[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:46.820]
Walk outside, go to the nearest sidewalk and get down and kiss the goddamn ground is what you ought to do.

[01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:53.600]
First, he starts by insulting our intelligence that because they played a stupid goddamn baseball game

[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:56.740]
in the Baltimore last night, that we all think that Fidel is an ice guy,

[01:41:56.740 --> 01:41:59.680]
which is a total pile of crap and a slap in our face.

[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:02.800]
And many turns around and tells us he don't want to be a...

[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:03.440]
Well, guess what?

[01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:07.380]
The last time I checked the schedule, the rubber rafts are leaving every 30 seconds.

[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:13.100]
If people could get here on a rubber raft, they could go back to Cuba on a rubber raft

[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.700]
and find out how great it is.

[01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:19.300]
Because I hear the hotels and the casinos are second and none.

[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:20.800]
That's what I heard.

[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:22.700]
Some stupid gangster movie.

[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:28.120]
Go out there and kiss the sidewalk, okay?

[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:30.920]
Holmes did, hello?

[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:31.800]
New.

[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:32.460]
Yes, sir.

[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.740]
Yeah, I was thinking we should take all the Albanian refugees

[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:39.980]
and put them in Cuba to start their own neighborhoods and refuse to speak Spanish.

[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:42.920]
Well, they were thinking of that and they were going to put them in Guatónamo

[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:44.800]
but then they couldn't afford bilingual education.

[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:47.820]
No, I'm... you know, put them in Cuban society.

[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.060]
Okay, whatever you say.

[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:53.520]
560-560 on the mobile one line.

[01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:55.940]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello?

[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:56.360]
Hi, Neil.

[01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:56.900]
Yes, sir.

[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:57.960]
Yeah, that's the thing.

[01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:00.540]
My grandfather was a refugee from Russia.

[01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:04.160]
When I used to just try to ask him about Russia, he'd spit on the floor.

[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:05.660]
He wouldn't even talk to me about it.

[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:06.080]
Excellent.

[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:07.680]
Also, there was...

[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:09.580]
Every time I hear Russia, I spit on the floor.

[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:13.960]
There was a Cuban guy that called a while ago trying to draw an analogy

[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:17.080]
about would Hitler come here, would we play a game?

[01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:21.380]
Within you, of course, immediately showed how foolish that was.

[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:22.460]
We're not at war with them.

[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:26.100]
In a dig in which the whole world went there in 1936 to Berlin

[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:29.160]
and we had the goddamn world Olympics, would Hitler sit in there in the stands

[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:31.880]
and would Jesse Owens, you know, winning the gold medals, etc.

[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:33.440]
And it's already gone on.

[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:36.700]
Right, but the thing is, quite a few years ago,

[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:40.260]
the Nazis and the... I think it was the Ku Klux Klan

[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:44.940]
wanted to have a march-down date boulevard on the beach by the Holocaust Memorial.

[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:46.160]
Remember that?

[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:46.540]
Yes.

[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:47.820]
They were denied their permit.

[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:52.940]
So, you know, I mean, when you get an area that's concentrated

[01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:55.340]
with one group of people, and they want to...

[01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:56.860]
Well, let me ask you this.

[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.940]
Is Baltimore a concentrated with millions of Cubans?

[01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:00.860]
No, not at all.

[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:02.740]
What's the analogy?

[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:05.040]
Why would this owner even do this?

[01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:05.840]
I don't get it.

[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:08.760]
What would prompt him to be the one that comes forward and wants to do?

[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:10.760]
Sir, what difference does it make?

[01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:13.060]
Did you see the little kids, the Cuban kids,

[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:15.060]
and the American kids playing ball with each other?

[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:15.520]
Right.

[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:17.620]
What? This is the way things are done.

[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:19.060]
There's plenty of pressure in this.

[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:20.620]
This goes on all the time.

[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:23.380]
Okay.

[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:24.340]
What difference does it make?

[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:26.860]
What is different today than yesterday?

[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:28.540]
They yesterday morning at the same time.

[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:29.680]
They played a ball game.

[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:32.020]
The Orioles were disgrace because they stink the joy out.

[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:33.300]
What did it change?

[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.060]
Shopping, and it's not going to change that.

[01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:38.620]
So, why are people all with up in this town about this?

[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:40.120]
When, like I said, five minutes ago,

[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:42.900]
there were all these other grotesque things going on in the country.

[01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:46.420]
We just had 50 people get killed in the tornadoes in the Midwest this morning.

[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:48.240]
We got kids shooting each other in schools.

[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:49.900]
We got gun nuts running around.

[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:53.580]
We got gun shop gun show spots on this radio station

[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:55.800]
and on the show which make me nauseous, by the way.

[01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:57.540]
And nobody cares about these things.

[01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:59.560]
Right because there's two million Cubans here.

[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:00.060]
That's why.

[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.600]
Well, that's my point.

[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:03.900]
Let them start worrying about things that have to do with America

[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:05.800]
and forget about Cuba for a change.

[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:06.500]
Agreed.

[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:07.020]
100%.

[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:07.320]
Okay.

[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:10.020]
Like they got to want people to go back.

[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:11.020]
Well, guess what, sir?

[01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:12.560]
You're not going back.

[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:14.200]
So, one of two things.

[01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:16.880]
Either go out and kiss the sidewalk like I suggested to you

[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:19.220]
or go out there and sit on your haunches like a dog

[01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:21.480]
and they at the moon when it comes out tonight.

[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:25.060]
When sunset comes and look up there in the sky and start howling at the moon

[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:26.200]
and maybe it'll go away.

[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:26.800]
I doubt it.

[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:29.860]
God.

[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:34.800]
Talk about wasting your time with the same old tired, repetitive craft.

[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:36.260]
It just wears you out.

[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:37.200]
I don't know about you, folks,

[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:39.580]
but it wears my ass out.

[01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:46.980]
23 years I've been on the Uranus town and it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse.

[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:48.840]
I go away for nine days.

[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:50.880]
I come back all over the rest of the world.

[01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:52.160]
You know, you turn on your TV.

[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:55.480]
They're talking about things that you'd expect people to be talking about.

[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:00.680]
And you come back here and it's just like it never missed a beat.

[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:05.340]
The same old tired craft.

[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:08.980]
North Miami Beach.

[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:09.200]
Hello.

[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:10.100]
How you doing, what's up?

[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:10.740]
How you doing, sir?

[01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:12.840]
I'm going to make a couple comments.

[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:16.720]
First, you know, the caller from an older span of span is about noon.

[01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:20.600]
He was making a comment about how they made this woman leave from the state where the shirt.

[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:23.860]
That guy couldn't be more of a liar if he's like, what happened?

[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:24.280]
What happened?

[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.920]
It's four or five Cuban people ran down until the field and middle of the game

[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:31.820]
and they caught around and about threw them out like they should have.

[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:35.000]
They didn't make anybody leave because of the teacher and they all come up.

[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:35.920]
So where did he come up with that?

[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:39.400]
I mean, I didn't even watch it so I had no idea I worked it out here or less.

[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:40.240]
I didn't. He's nuts.

[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:40.500]
Okay.

[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:43.580]
The only people that got thrown out of the ones that ran into the field during the game and they should have.

[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:49.800]
And the other comment I wanted to make was, all the span of the figure that talked about how much they've upcubing the hate.

[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:50.980]
Go back, get out of here.

[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:51.280]
Please.

[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:53.740]
And quit talking about it so we're going to make you right, buddy.

[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:55.480]
Well, Pacquiao made a note here.

[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:57.140]
I'll hop the pack of bags.

[01:46:57.420 --> 01:46:57.660]
Okay.

[01:46:57.900 --> 01:46:58.420]
Thanks, look at this.

[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:01.400]
He'd rather be there.

[01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:04.740]
And what's he going to do when he goes there?

[01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:05.880]
What's he going to be?

[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:07.120]
Is he going to eat the soil?

[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:11.760]
Now this is what kills me about people, not just Cubans, about people in general.

[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.600]
It's like with the Jews and the Arabs, you know what?

[01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:15.240]
That piece of desert they got over there.

[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:19.340]
Oh, and it's the Holy Land, the Gentiles and the Arabs and the Islamics and the Jews.

[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:20.820]
All those crazy people over there.

[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:23.940]
Over this piece of desert, this piece of dreck.

[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:26.000]
Oh, but it's the Holy Land.

[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:26.640]
Yeah, right.

[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:35.560]
Here's a mobile invoiting beat, shallow.

[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:36.180]
Oh, God.

[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:36.860]
Speaking.

[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:43.420]
Listen, the first guy they call, the same Cuban should leave, you know, why they leave Cuba and why they're in the same fight?

[01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:44.600]
Let's call the year.

[01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:47.660]
And they got to follow it up and said the Irish is the same thing.

[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:48.560]
He's totally off-beat.

[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:52.340]
The Irish left because of depression and the famine.

[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:55.040]
Not because of persecution or error.

[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:58.660]
I think they got tired of the potatoes as what it was, you know?

[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:04.280]
Well, anyway, so they got off-base and the Irish are popular and they're never back down from a fight in their life.

[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.180]
Well, that's because they're drunk most of the time.

[01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:07.640]
Yeah, well, that's for real.

[01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:08.340]
Oh, yeah.

[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:08.760]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:11.360]
A full version of lotion in the basket.

[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:11.780]
Okay.

[01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:12.520]
Take a lot.

[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:12.880]
See you.

[01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:16.120]
Yeah, the Irish never back down from it.

[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:21.120]
That's why they always have to have the good bell through to it before they start planting the abams there in the bell fast.

[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.280]
And they're real gutsy people over there now.

[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:25.920]
The Protestants and the Catholics, these Serbs and the Albanians.

[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:28.980]
All this good old religious love by God is sure working mysteriously.

[01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:32.880]
He's got kids being killed in schools all over the country now.

[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:35.980]
Be sure to even up in Calgary, up in the Alberta, there in Canada.

[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:38.460]
Got these tornadoes going.

[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:40.840]
His wrath must be waxing real hot.

[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.580]
I'm telling you, Ryan DeRong station right now.

[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:48.620]
The station for these times is waxing because his wrath is waxing hot.

[01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:51.300]
He is fired up and pithed off the Lord.

[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:53.340]
And even...

[01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:54.020]
Oh God!

[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.660]
...is getting pretty smoked off about this whole thing too.

[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:57.480]
I'll tell you right now.

[01:48:58.200 --> 01:48:59.340]
Whatever this thing is.

[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:04.380]
567-0560-0.560 on the mobile one line.

[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:07.120]
I mentioned, by the way, the fact that in Cologne, Germany,

[01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:10.420]
never heard one word of esponule and only saw three sparsers in three days.

[01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:11.460]
That's one a day.

[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:12.400]
I can handle that.

[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:16.140]
What's wrong with that?

[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:17.680]
I'm just telling you the way I feel about life.

[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:19.600]
I mean, you know, birds of a feather, we stick together.

[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:22.280]
Of course, I don't know if there are any other Jews there in Cologne,

[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:24.020]
and I didn't stick around long enough to find out.

[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.520]
I know I did pee on the train.

[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:27.800]
That's my new tour, near Rodgers tour,

[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:29.400]
peeing across the Rhineland.

[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:32.800]
Dumping across the Rhineland by train.

[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:34.380]
Right through that little pipe,

[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.040]
giving it a right back to those Nazi bastards.

[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:37.700]
See, that's the way you get even.

[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:40.420]
All you Cubans out there that are all whipped up.

[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:42.340]
How about dumping on Castro's beard, huh?

[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:43.100]
That's it.

[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:46.220]
Get some of that good beans and horse meat that you eat.

[01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:47.160]
You love so much.

[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:48.100]
That's it.

[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:49.300]
Send it to Fidel in a bag.

[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:51.740]
Send them all a crap you got.

[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:54.640]
That we could support.

[01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:58.280]
26 past noon at 560 W.C.M.

[01:49:58.420 --> 01:49:58.620]
You know.

[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:01.240]
This is Debbie.

[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:02.040]
Hello, Debbie.

[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:04.800]
I'm in the student getting through operations, Don.

[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:05.600]
Okay.

[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:07.960]
And some body contouring and some liposuction.

[01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:08.560]
Mm-hmm.

[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:10.740]
And there was wondering if it's some tummy tuck,

[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:14.020]
and lip augmentation cosmetic breast surgery

[01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:15.840]
that you face with, all of these things.

[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:16.360]
Mm-hmm.

[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:17.560]
And you're just wondering.

[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:18.740]
Well, you like to start with.

[01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:21.200]
Well, I need to get everything done.

[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:25.640]
Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my thing.

[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:27.200]
Okay, we don't do that.

[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:27.680]
No.

[01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:29.580]
Could you do breast implants, though?

[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:31.720]
Uh, I can't be done.

[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:33.240]
I don't know what they would do right away.

[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:35.160]
It would be the lotion in the basket.

[02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:14.800]
a

[02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:16.060]
is on the streets here in Goodshape.

[02:47:16.820 --> 02:47:17.480]
And have a great day.

[02:47:17.580 --> 02:47:17.860]
Exactly.

[02:47:18.160 --> 02:47:18.240]
Here.

[02:47:19.820 --> 02:47:20.920]
That's the kind of trash in.

[02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:22.860]
And now what was that thing in that bit that I just

[02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:24.760]
played about the Coons of the Road, something like that?

[02:47:26.820 --> 02:47:29.860]
I see we got the new General Manager, WQM, just came in with a

[02:47:29.860 --> 02:47:31.980]
much better suit than the old one, by the way, without the red

[02:47:31.980 --> 02:47:33.640]
nose and the cracked coxus, too.

[02:47:34.220 --> 02:47:37.080]
I think Greg Reed had one physical problem to many, one

[02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:39.200]
ailment to many in the head of a well-shipped ass-out.

[02:47:39.540 --> 02:47:41.900]
And of course, how can a guy like Greg Reed afford to be running this place

[02:47:41.900 --> 02:47:44.280]
and pay me all his money when food he says or sell those

[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:45.100]
cheap spots?

[02:47:46.640 --> 02:47:47.980]
Anybody want to buy any Marlon's spot?

[02:47:48.220 --> 02:47:48.380]
No.

[02:47:49.020 --> 02:47:49.900]
Here's Miami Beach.

[02:47:50.100 --> 02:47:50.160]
Hello.

[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:51.600]
Yes, sir.

[02:47:51.700 --> 02:47:51.980]
How you doing?

[02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:52.460]
Great.

[02:47:52.540 --> 02:47:54.820]
Yeah, that guy had called a couple of calls ago.

[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.480]
He said that one of the players defected.

[02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:58.400]
It is true.

[02:47:58.820 --> 02:47:59.680]
I did hear it on the news.

[02:47:59.860 --> 02:48:02.920]
It may be one or two players defected and maybe one or two.

[02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:03.160]

[02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:04.300]
One or two.

[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:08.520]
And some of the, probably some of the 300 delegation that came.

[02:48:09.260 --> 02:48:09.500]
Yeah.

[02:48:09.860 --> 02:48:11.260]
They might have defected.

[02:48:11.260 --> 02:48:16.920]
But they also reported that Brady Anderson and BJ Serbop have defected the cue with playing baseball.

[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:17.880]
Okay.

[02:48:19.160 --> 02:48:19.520]
Right.

[02:48:19.980 --> 02:48:21.580]
All a bunch of bull crap is what it is.

[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:23.400]
All a pile of crap is what it is.

[02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:28.360]
Such a, I mean, like I said, around the rest of the world, people are talking about stuff

[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:29.200]
that's important here.

[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:30.500]
They're talking about the same old...

[02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:30.920]
I'm tired.

[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:31.300]
I'm tired.

[02:48:32.460 --> 02:48:32.620]
I'm tired.

[02:48:32.780 --> 02:48:33.140]
I'm tired.

[02:48:34.380 --> 02:48:34.540]
Jesus.

[02:48:35.220 --> 02:48:36.100]
You can smell it.

[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:37.040]
Or maybe it's these cigars.

[02:48:37.540 --> 02:48:38.260]
Just a joke, Joe.

[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:40.460]
What are you laughing about?

[02:48:40.460 --> 02:48:41.260]
Look at these.

[02:48:41.300 --> 02:48:43.120]
These are like Opus X.

[02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:45.420]
Nick would be real upset to see this.

[02:48:45.820 --> 02:48:46.180]
Although I did.

[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:46.660]
The problem was.

[02:48:47.060 --> 02:48:47.180]
Huh?

[02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:49.720]
Lahabaniera.

[02:48:50.260 --> 02:48:50.960]
Is that correct?

[02:48:51.540 --> 02:48:51.780]
Sure.

[02:48:52.300 --> 02:48:52.800]
Sure what?

[02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:53.380]
Close enough.

[02:48:54.100 --> 02:48:54.460]
Lahabaniera.

[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:56.380]
It doesn't have a thrill on it.

[02:48:56.720 --> 02:48:57.660]
It doesn't have a till date.

[02:48:58.500 --> 02:48:58.860]
Lahabaniera.

[02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:01.860]
It's a thrill on it when you smoke it, though.

[02:49:02.160 --> 02:49:02.820]
And Mr. Gar too.

[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:06.380]
By the way, tomorrow's today we're going to be smoking weed in here because we have a short show.

[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:07.200]
So we know.

[02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:08.020]
Why is he going to do that?

[02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:09.620]
What's the time of that ball game?

[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:12.300]
Yeah, you've got to get stolen to listen to the Marlon game.

[02:49:12.360 --> 02:49:12.860]
Yeah, I'm on.

[02:49:13.380 --> 02:49:15.360]
So that's coming up at 1230 to pregame tomorrow.

[02:49:15.460 --> 02:49:16.120]
We've got a short show.

[02:49:16.460 --> 02:49:17.860]
Oh, here's a Fwente.

[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:19.700]
Fwente Fwente Opus X.

[02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:22.400]
Why does it have Fwente under twice?

[02:49:23.100 --> 02:49:23.980]
This one is good that way.

[02:49:24.060 --> 02:49:25.140]
Is one of them Tito Fwente?

[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:28.060]
And Puppy Campo?

[02:49:28.580 --> 02:49:31.080]
By the way, watch out for your Puppy Campo, baby.

[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:33.060]
What teams are you playing on?

[02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:35.700]
Anyway, it's 149 at 560.

[02:49:35.700 --> 02:49:37.380]
Who's that guy that Greg Regis brought in here?

[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:38.060]
Was that the new GM?

[02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:39.040]
I think you're right.

[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:41.520]
Yeah, he looked more like a business guy.

[02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:42.180]
He looked like a man.

[02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:44.040]
Not like that sloppy guy we got.

[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:45.920]
That runs around sick all the time.

[02:49:46.740 --> 02:49:49.320]
And you know, pro business is the place to go for all your eye care needs.
