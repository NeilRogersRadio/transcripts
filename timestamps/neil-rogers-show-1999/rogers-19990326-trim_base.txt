[00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.380]

[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.480]
No, no. Neil Rogers on Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.980]
It's Friday, you bastard.

[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.180]
This portion of our show is brought to you by Boo Blue.

[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:43.480]
A little bit of you on each titty and we're talking of 40 W and they all knew Palm Ball because love and loneliness go hand in hand.

[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.680]
Remember Palm Ball, now back to our show.

[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.820]
The first day of the show.

[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.000]
One night in need of a screw.

[00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.880]
My lord did hate.

[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:10.180]
My balls were blue and I hooked up and thought what about our three girls?

[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.080]
Yes.

[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.340]
I see five of trees and eighty-five.

[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.740]
I'll face the mosquito, but they're not mine.

[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.320]
And I think to myself, whatever we grow.

[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.940]
My hell, I've drink a lot and I'm feeling pretty high.

[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.420]
I've got to find a take of these.

[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.520]
I reach out with my hands and how do you do?

[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.520]
Really mean it.

[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.500]
You'll have to do through that.

[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.640]
That's the last time I guess that's all.

[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.580]
I want you at the dinner.

[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.460]
We know her mom.

[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.500]
Now I'm so happy.

[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.100]
What a bunch of people.

[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.800]
Yeah, I think you might just put up a big girl.

[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.800]

[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.020]
Welcome.

[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.020]
What about that forehead?

[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.540]
Notice how I used to sweat up a storm all the time.

[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.280]
I came in this morning and I got the brow art edition of the hero.

[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.460]
I didn't see that story.

[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.220]
I'm sitting here, minding my own business, picking my nose a little bit.

[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.360]
And Diffle comes in here, boy, I'm telling you.

[00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.980]
I'm serious.

[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.000]
I say this, not out of disrespect.

[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.980]
I know it's never taken the right way.

[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.180]
Luke Shambi, he's on the top of the list.

[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.420]
Hank, he's right in there.

[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.760]
I know he's driving over to Tampa today.

[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.880]
Although he's doing a good job.

[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.700]
He's losing some weight.

[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.140]
He's smearin' olive oil on his parts wherever he's smearin' it.

[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.980]
And Diffle, he's gettin' right up there in that category.

[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.060]
You know what I'm talkin' about?

[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.420]
I wanna get porky about this, but for the looks of it, he says to me,

[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.840]
so you heard Sonny checked out.

[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.200]
I said, what?

[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.400]
He said it's on the front page of the sports section in the hero.

[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.120]
And of course, my hero, I get the brow art edition, which probably goes to bed about the,

[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.680]
you know, hours before the other one.

[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.040]
Sonny Hirsch, dead at 65.

[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.100]
I was just making a list of the people that I worked within this market

[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.020]
over the last 23 years who are dead.

[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.800]
We'll tell you a little bit.

[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.040]
Sonny was just a good guy, you know what I mean?

[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.540]
I don't wanna be one of those people that comes on a year and start.

[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.400]
You know, I was never close friends with Sonny Hirsch, but when I came to this market in 1976,

[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.040]
Sonny was the sports director.

[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.480]
And Chris Myers, who is now, what is he now on Fox, but he was on ESPN for a long time.

[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.820]
Chris was like his underling, his protege, his apprentice.

[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.260]
And Sonny, of course, at that time was doing this thing with the baby always.

[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.120]
I mean, minor league baseball team that he was very dedicated with and kept it going for a hell of a long time.

[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.320]
And he's just a good guy.

[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.040]
I mean, Sonny was just somebody you'd always expect to be around.

[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.760]
Then when I went over to IOD, Sonny was the sports director there.

[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.960]
And he was, you know, Sonny was always around.

[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.840]
27 years doing UM sports.

[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.400]
See, I don't wanna start making any accusations because I don't know the details.

[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.400]
I'll read you the story and, you know, I got a good facts here too, by the way.

[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.820]
You know, you people that wanna scream and yell about it.

[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.580]
There is absolutely, if you look on page 19a, they buried it.

[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.620]
I'm surprised they even put it in the herald because they pandered so much all the time.

[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.680]
Basically what they said is these kind of, for these kind of activities like the baseball game in Cuba,

[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.740]
they go on all the time.

[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.020]
These, you know, inter-national back and forth, we have all kinds of stuff that goes on.

[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.440]
People, the people, kind of activities between America and Cuba, forgetting about the governments.

[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.940]
It's not a controversy.

[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.980]
I don't care what John Henry says because they know he's pandering like crazy.

[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.740]
And I have nothing but contempt for him by the way for doing that.

[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.280]
All of a sudden, here, that he discovers that there's this ripple of, you know, a small segment of those same hysterical,

[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.700]
a few thousand old Cubans.

[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.320]
Pepe, pepe, pepe, pepe, Pucca Manista.

[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.980]
You know, it makes no difference.

[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.980]
It will change nothing.

[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.300]
And anybody who says that we don't know what poverty and desperation that people in Cuba live in because somebody's gonna go play a baseball game there Sunday.

[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.980]
Anybody who says that, he's an asshole, right?

[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.180]
And the fact here says, according to most of the listeners this morning, very few have said anything about sunny.

[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.960]
They seem to be more interested in a meaningless game with a Cuban baseball team.

[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.800]
The area is lost to great historical local radio voice in the sound of UM Sports.

[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.700]
I'm sorry to have him go age-shector.

[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.860]
Well, thank you, age-shector, for least carrying it up to the center to the facts and saying

[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.200]
something.

[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.660]
That's nice.

[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.640]
After the other guy's been on the air.

[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.340]
Well, let's see.

[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.320]
I've been here 23 years and sunny was already here.

[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.480]
So I have no idea how long he was on a KAT when I came here.

[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.340]
In fact, I have those old promotional pictures.

[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.860]
You've seen those from KAT with Craig Worthing is in there.

[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.360]
And Lynn Russell, who's now on the headline news for the last 100 years, and does a good

[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.800]
job too.

[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.560]
Nice going, Lynn.

[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.280]
Never gets any older either, by the way.

[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.940]
And who else was that?

[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.560]
Jim Alden.

[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.540]
They named a street after him.

[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.860]
He was on the morning show with Lynn Russell.

[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.720]
Pretty bad show.

[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.920]
And I was under a great Davey Gravy line was on a station at your service.

[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.980]
And the sunny was the sports director.

[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.420]
Joe Fried was the news director.

[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.020]
Joe Fried did for a long time now, by the way.

[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.960]
Chris Myers, like I said, was sunny as the underling.

[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.940]
And I realized that's a long time ago.

[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.280]
That's 23 years ago.

[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.760]
Some of you weren't even born then.

[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.560]
I was thinking to myself, you know, what are the events that have happened?

[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.360]
And I'll just read this part.

[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.120]
Joseph Gacchiogis said that he believed sunny died of natural causes, but that hasn't

[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.760]
been confirmed.

[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.360]
According to Miami-Dade police dispatch records, a call came in at 9 p.m. about a sick person

[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.960]
last night when fire rescue arrived at Hersh's Miami Lake apartment.

[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.440]
He refused CPR and he then died.

[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.080]
And that's all there is.

[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.580]
So if there's any more information about it, I haven't forgotten it yet.

[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.440]
So who knows?

[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.780]
Well, one of the things that I know that sunny suffered from for the last year and a half,

[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.220]
even though I have last time we saw him was the day that he was leaving.

[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.000]
Well, then he was in with a couple of times over at Chulis.

[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.000]
You know, he's been around.

[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.620]
But for the last year and a half, while we were screwing him in the back, I don't want

[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.100]
to mention any names over there at the Paxen and then Cleared Day.

[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.120]
It was really Cleared Channel.

[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.460]
I don't want to mention Pete Boulger, even though I know it will generate the Faxen

[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.340]
machine going again, because I was sitting here this morning.

[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.760]
I'm not a mean spirit.

[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.040]
It's by the radio thing.

[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.620]
This is stick.

[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.280]
It's a radio show.

[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.820]
I keep trying to tell people that I don't wish any bad to anybody.

[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.340]
Even people who have been rotten to me.

[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.620]
I don't wish him anything bad.

[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.500]
Life is too short.

[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.060]
But I'm thinking this morning if it had to be somebody that died prematurely, you know,

[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.840]
why couldn't it have been Pete Boulger?

[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.340]
What?

[00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:58.340]
Huh?

[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.600]
See, George is letting out like, you know, hallelujah.

[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.540]
And orgasmic grunt.

[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:03.740]
Right.

[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.800]
Yeah, I mean, you know, again, I don't wish that, but I'm saying if somebody had to go,

[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.960]
I mean, here's a guy that was doing this job for 27 years.

[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.820]
And I'm not going to, I'm because somebody dies, I'm not going to lie to you.

[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.840]
I never thought something was a great sportscaster, but he was fine.

[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.500]
He did a good, you know, solid job.

[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.900]
He was there a year in and year out.

[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.680]
He was a part of the UM, part of the program, part of the university.

[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.420]
He was associated with UM sports.

[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.220]
He was fine.

[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.580]
Never stole a freight train, never bothered anybody.

[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.080]
Wasn't a mean vindictive guy.

[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.340]
He was just a low key easygoing guy that just about everybody liked.

[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:42.540]
And these people over there at Queer Channel, they had deep-sixed him on the UM sports long before.

[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.040]
They had a Lamont already knew it.

[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.880]
Of course, I'm, what do I say about my buddy Dave Lamont?

[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.180]
He's a good guy and I don't want him to feel too bad.

[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:49.860]
All I'm sure he does.

[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.560]
Any worse than he has to.

[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.780]
You know what I'm talking about, George?

[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.020]
Dave Lamont.

[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.840]
Yeah, I don't want him to.

[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.700]
Well, let me do the break.

[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:56.920]
No.

[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.460]
No, seriously, it's a difficult thing.

[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.320]
And I don't want to directly blame Pete Polder.

[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.420]
But like I said, if somebody had to die, Pete, and you know, take this personally.

[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.860]
I usually say don't take it personally.

[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.460]
Take it personally, because I mean it.

[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.940]
Because I've, you know, sat around and watched what you've done to people and lied and manipulated

[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.040]
and twisted and refused to tell people the truth.

[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.200]
And you know, it's one thing.

[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.280]
I know we all got to survive.

[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.100]
We got to make a living.

[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.680]
But Jesus Christ doesn't there have to be a limit somewhere?

[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.600]
Yes, God.

[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.280]
Have a little bit of rock money.

[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.320]
It's a little bit of compassion, a little bit of humanity somewhere.

[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.420]
Instead of just looking at the acid, every corporation that comes around and sticks its back to your face.

[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.020]
Oh, that's it?

[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.160]
Okay, shorten sweet.

[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.040]
Oh,

[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.060]
it's great.

[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:03.760]
Yeah,

[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.720]
it's great.

[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.060]
Yeah,

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.060]

[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:10.600]
Yeah,

[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.640]
it's great.

[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:11.640]

[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:11.720]
it's great.

[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.340]
Yeah,

[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.220]
it's great.

[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.080]
Yeah,

[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.540]
it's great.

[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:18.680]
Yeah,

[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.020]
it's great.

[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:21.240]
Yeah,

[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:23.260]

[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:23.260]

[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:23.260]

[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.900]
the crappy days are here.

[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.340]
They've got

[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.480]
every

[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.140]
couple of

[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.060]
happy days.

[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.680]
They've got

[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.360]
it's like

[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:35.920]
it's too

[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.320]
crappy days.

[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:37.980]
They've got

[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.680]
no.

[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.600]
There has

[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.960]
these days are gone.

[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:42.680]
There you

[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.040]
crappy days.

[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.860]
Time for 15 is 560 WQM.

[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.420]
Go for gets tomorrow morning six o'clock.

[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.600]
Joe Costello will be on here.

[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.340]
Gonna be okay tomorrow.

[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.700]
Yeah, he's getting his health back in time to be on the air.

[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:52.800]
So he did the smart thing.

[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:53.700]
He got sick during the week.

[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.340]
And of course he caught it from Greg Read, our general manager.

[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.700]
Bozo walking around here spreading mono.

[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.840]
Is he here today, by the way?

[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.560]
I sure hope not.

[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.520]
Is he in the building?

[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.480]
Haven't seen him.

[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:03.900]
Thank God.

[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.880]
I mean, take a few days.

[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.420]
We don't

[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.300]
be grudger.

[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.020]
Take a few days in the heal up

[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.840]
and stop spreading your disease around Greg.

[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.780]
People are droppin' like flies.

[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:12.560]
You know,

[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.600]
somebody called George and the off-theor made the point

[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.000]
and I was always over to go to get to that.

[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:16.780]
Sonny Hurston,

[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.260]
that what?

[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.320]
He's back on.

[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.100]
Sure, I'll let him say it.

[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.400]
I want to help.

[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.860]
What lines are you?

[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:23.140]
Side.

[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.900]
Here's a mobile in Palm Beach Gardens.

[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:26.200]
Hello.

[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.540]
Hey, good morning,

[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.620]
the electric...

[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.540]
Let me just say morning.

[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.140]
How about that?

[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:30.620]
Okay.

[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.580]
Hey, I had to,

[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.380]
I'm here in a little kinko

[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:34.560]
here.

[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.820]
I don't know if you touched on whatever.

[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.200]
You know, they can say that he died of a heart attack

[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:38.700]
or whatever.

[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.080]
Right.

[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.100]
But we all know he died of a broken heart.

[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:41.560]
That's right.

[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.780]
That's what I was getting to because

[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.460]
people are here in a clear channel.

[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.880]
People strung him along.

[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.160]
That's why I told him,

[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.160]
why is the rest of you not?

[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:49.100]
Huh?

[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.040]
Yeah, I wasn't even sure.

[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.400]
I was hoping,

[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.180]
you just answered my question.

[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:52.900]
I was going to ask you,

[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.260]
you know, who ran him out of that

[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.620]
contact or who didn't read the contact?

[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.160]
No, no, it's not a question.

[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.220]
Who didn't read the contact?

[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.920]
It's a question of if you're going to...

[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.080]
Here is a man who was fired in the media.

[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.580]
Everybody in this town knew

[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.080]
that he wasn't coming back to do this.

[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.000]
That's how you're supposed to be.

[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.780]
That's how you're supposed to be.

[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.160]
Everybody else knew it

[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.080]
and they wouldn't tell him.

[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.200]
All he wanted was tell me,

[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:10.860]
am I coming back?

[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.520]
Am I fired?

[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.020]
Am I in?

[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:12.380]
Am I out?

[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.440]
They wouldn't tell him.

[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.140]
They strung him out

[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.620]
until a couple of days before

[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.560]
the season started

[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.520]
and finally said,

[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.220]
oh, by the way,

[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.600]
don't bother doing the games you're out.

[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.800]
Well, when I heard it on the worst team this morning,

[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.240]
that was the first thing that came to my mind

[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.180]
when they said the heart attack.

[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.320]
I'm like, yeah, I'm broken in heart.

[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.320]
That's right.

[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.820]
And what have I been telling you guys

[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.940]
for years about this business?

[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.240]
They try to break your spirit.

[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.120]
They will break you.

[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.240]
They will destroy you.

[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.180]
They will trash you.

[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.840]
And they discard you

[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.860]
like yesterday's garbage.

[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.180]
Well, I had a grandparent that died.

[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:38.960]
It was a great health,

[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.960]
died shortly after my grandfather passed away.

[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.060]
You know, I mean, it happens.

[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.960]
And I know that happened with Sony as well.

[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.600]
Stress kills.

[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.120]
Okay, thanks.

[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.160]
That's all, you know.

[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:46.320]
Okay.

[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:46.940]
See you later.

[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.800]
Thanks for caring enough to send you very best.

[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.740]
See somebody cares.

[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.340]
Not too many.

[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.300]
Like I said, you can work here for 100 years

[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:54.900]
and you're croaking.

[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]
Okay, well, let's move on.

[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.520]
What, you know, make us laugh, you know,

[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]
that's just the way it is.

[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.160]
That's the Merck and F and way,

[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.200]
especially in this town.

[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.680]
There's no heart in this town.

[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.700]
There's no one, you know,

[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.600]
it's a place that's like Gene Pettney said,

[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.640]
that's not without Pettie.

[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.040]
But that whole episode,

[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.420]
man, I have never,

[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.300]
I mean, you know, this does happen in the business.

[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.100]
I've blurred it out on the air.

[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.300]
Who the hell was it that time?

[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.180]
Which time?

[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.200]
Oh, that's right.

[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:20.660]
Many times.

[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.380]
You know,

[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.460]
the way Reynolds three times.

[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.940]
But he's only reason though

[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.580]
that that happened is because people tell me these things

[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.500]
and he was assume that the program director is notified.

[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.940]
The person that's going to get canned

[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.400]
and I talk about it on the air,

[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.820]
or G. Jolie is going to be here.

[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:35.840]
And oh, guess what?

[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.740]
Nobody told him yet.

[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.420]
So people have found out from me on the air,

[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.280]
not intentionally,

[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.020]
not because I did it in the mean-spirited way,

[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.880]
just because we have program directors

[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.620]
and other people who are like too much weaklings

[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.920]
who just have to build up the, you know,

[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.800]
the courage to tell somebody your canned.

[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.260]
That's the kind of horse-crab businesses.

[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.000]
If you think that I make up anything about this business,

[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.860]
you're very naive, okay?

[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.940]
Is that QUE or K.A.Y.?

[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:02.680]
How do you want to spell it?

[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.760]
And if you see K, by the way,

[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:04.880]
tell her that shows sucked.

[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.520]
That's the nature of the business.

[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.100]
You can be the nicest damn guy.

[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.080]
I mean, Craig Worthingworth.

[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.420]
And by the way, Craig is back on here on WSRF.

[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.060]
We were that on that Jack Mark station,

[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.640]
which I wish him well, 6 to 8 PM.

[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.060]
And I, well, he's got to make a living.

[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.020]
There's another guy got screwed over by Pete Boulder.

[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.080]
Just one after another after another.

[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:23.880]
Good people.

[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.200]
The good people get screwed over.

[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.380]
The people with no talent

[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.620]
who don't belong on the air for two minutes.

[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.760]
Yeah, they get hired.

[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:31.520]
They get put on the air

[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:31.980]
while they're busy,

[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.380]
are changing their tires or something out of the side of the high one.

[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.160]
They get put on whatever that screw was all about.

[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.640]
They get put back on the air

[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.180]
because they work cheap, I guess.

[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.900]
You know, 65 is not an old man.

[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.140]
And some of you that sounds like especially in South Florida.

[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.700]
65 is almost like a teenager.

[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.880]
And of course, for somebody like me,

[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.940]
it makes you kind of like wonder,

[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.580]
well, you know, another three and a half years,

[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.780]
that's a long time.

[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.380]
People had planned for retirement,

[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.340]
that plan that you know,

[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.820]
you put away as much money as you can,

[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:02.940]
and you're going to do this,

[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.900]
you go to, and I'll never made it, you know?

[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.040]
That's what happened.

[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.340]
And it makes you wonder, maybe Monday, you know,

[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.480]
George would be good on his show.

[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:12.000]
He'd be great.

[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:12.860]
I'll just, you know,

[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.520]
see what I scraped together, what I can.

[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:14.980]
What?

[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.860]
It makes you think that for a second and a half,

[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.680]
especially since yesterday was payday,

[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.560]
and it's several more days till the next one now.

[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.980]
I mean, of course, you get to payday,

[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:23.640]
then you start thinking,

[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.160]
well, maybe that's not such a good idea.

[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:26.880]
What?

[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.640]
That's the way it is because without money, man,

[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.300]
you can't live.

[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.320]
That's what it's all about.

[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.500]
So you have to keep working.

[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.840]
I have nothing but contempt for people like Bob Barker.

[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.120]
I don't want to hear this below me,

[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.280]
but oh, yeah, well, some of these guys,

[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.300]
you know, the minute they stop working,

[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.220]
they scribble up and die.

[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.860]
I'm sorry, I don't buy that.

[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.480]
I don't get that.

[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.440]
Like I've always said,

[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.940]
the wrong people have the big money.

[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.780]
If I had to kind of money that Bob Barker's got

[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.220]
or some of their Dick Clark is got,

[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.520]
or Ed McMahon is got,

[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.880]
would I be running around the country

[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.900]
when I'm doing all this crap?

[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:56.600]
Of course not.

[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.560]
I'd be living the life of Riley,

[00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.980]
Chester A. Riley, Mr.

[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.180]
The wrong God-damn people have got the money.

[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.100]
Dick Clark and all those other Dick's.

[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.220]
I mean, you know, we like you.

[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.440]
It's 100 years ago, American,

[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.680]
band, stand, pyramid.

[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.960]
That was one of my favorite shows,

[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.020]
good show, but go away already, okay?

[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.800]
Stop peddling all that crap into male with Ed McMahon.

[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.860]
Stop pretending all those old people

[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.620]
are going to win the money.

[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.460]
And just to go off and enjoy yourself.

[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.260]
Have a great life.

[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.800]
These people are going to die

[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.460]
doing whatever it is they do for a living.

[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.320]
I have just the greatest contempt for that.

[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.100]
I mean, you know, it's a free country

[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.460]
to appoint if that's what you want to do.

[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.200]
You're entitled, I don't understand it.

[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.100]
I don't relate to it.

[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.700]
Oh, my work is my life.

[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.140]
Well, you then get a life, huh?

[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.160]
If that's your life, I feel for it.

[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.460]
If this were my life, I mean, uh, oh, forget it.

[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:45.700]
Yeah.

[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.740]
I mean, it would be a no brainer.

[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.220]
I mean, literally a no brainer.

[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.440]
Let's blow it out of there, baby.

[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.060]
This is my life.

[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.200]
So Sonny Hurst passed away last night.

[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.020]
They said a heart attack.

[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.500]
And like this guy said, broken heart.

[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.240]
They broke his spirit.

[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.400]
They lied to him.

[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.380]
They stabbed him in the back.

[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.740]
They wouldn't give him an answer.

[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.000]
I mean, just stop and think about the stress.

[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.580]
You know, I mean, you've got a certain amount of ego,

[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.060]
a certain amount of pride, a certain amount a year ago.

[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.140]
Yesterday was exactly one year after Sonny Hurst

[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.040]
was inducted in the University of Miami Hall of Fame.

[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.640]
He's been the voice of Hurricane Sports for 27 years.

[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:17.700]
And they wouldn't tell him,

[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.740]
is he coming back, is he getting mad, is he in, is he out?

[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.220]
And like I started to say before,

[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.040]
everybody else in the market knew he was out.

[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:25.640]
Am I right?

[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.880]
I mean, I don't want to mention no names of people

[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.720]
that were working over there.

[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.420]
Who could have told them that, uh, guess what?

[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.380]
You're out, Sonny.

[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.340]
Just like I remember, he said,

[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.000]
you're out time and Godfather one.

[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.260]
Well, you're out, Sonny.

[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.380]
Dave Wemann.

[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.800]
He could have told him he knew he was going to be coming

[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.800]
and do the ball games.

[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.120]
But nobody wanted to tell him.

[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.860]
Nobody had the heart to tell him and see it was real.

[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.260]
They would, they did the wrong thing.

[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.280]
If they would have told him, it would have been better.

[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.240]
As opposed to stringing Malong.

[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.880]
And I remember all those articles and the newspapers

[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.760]
and people calling up the sports shows here.

[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.320]
Well, who's going to be doing you of a mouth?

[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.260]
Football, you know, they wouldn't say.

[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.060]
And I'm serious.

[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.200]
The packs and I draw them together

[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.500]
because it's a lot of the same people,

[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:04.960]
especially bulls are.

[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.060]
The packs and queer channel connection.

[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:08.860]
Nothing.

[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.800]
And I, there's some people over there that we like.

[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.740]
Like, we're in SUDs.

[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:12.900]
Adam, who else?

[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:13.360]
Wayne?

[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:14.600]
Anybody else?

[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:15.460]
David.

[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.600]
David, good guy.

[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:17.460]
Come on.

[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.540]
Are you mentioned several things?

[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.120]
I don't want to, because what I'm going to say,

[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.820]
I don't want to lump in anybody we like.

[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:22.820]
Oh, there's a lot of sales.

[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:23.820]
People over there, they're nice.

[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:24.760]
Dan Trotman.

[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:26.760]
Tom Benemberg?

[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:27.500]
Yeah.

[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:29.940]
Anybody else?

[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.700]
Okay, well, they've got to hand all the people we used to like.

[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:34.400]
Huh?

[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.660]
A lot of the people we like that were our friends.

[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.560]
They got canned also.

[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.400]
I'm talking about the people they're now.

[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.380]
The part of the packs and now ongoing

[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.320]
queer channel connection that have taken a stranglehold

[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.560]
on all these stations in this market.

[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.420]
Not one of them is worth a crap, by the way.

[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.520]
They all sound like crap.

[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.780]
The ratings of most of them, crap.

[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.120]
In fact, what they know about the businesses,

[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:53.540]
crap.

[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:53.960]

[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.900]
Nothing could happen to that bunch of people

[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.220]
no matter what it was.

[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.360]
That would be so severe that it would disturb me.

[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.620]
Do you follow what I'm saying?

[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.260]
And I really mean that.

[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.900]
And I'm not a vicious person.

[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:07.940]
I'm not a hateful person.

[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.720]
I don't sit around thinking, oh, yeah,

[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.700]
I wish somebody would die.

[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.840]
That's why I don't waste my time with that.

[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.360]
But you people, man, what you represent.

[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.920]
And this is another example of what you're a federal government.

[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.320]
And now that they're trying to dismantle the FCC,

[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.600]
which in some ways is good.

[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.260]
But now they're saying, oh, too much restriction.

[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.520]
How many stations companies get owned in the market?

[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.780]
Now, I was the one that came on the year a couple of years ago.

[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.980]
And maybe however many years it was, and I told you,

[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.860]
as soon as they started opening this up and letting a handful of

[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.520]
half a dozen companies own up every goddamn radio station in America,

[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.620]
it's bad for everybody.

[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.980]
It's bad, except the course for them, for the companies.

[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:45.340]
And they're shareholders.

[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.960]
It's bad for the audience because just look at the crap they put on the year.

[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.260]
No, they're no more talent because they don't want to pay anybody any money,

[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.160]
especially queer channel.

[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.220]
They just want to put a lot of slush on and squeeze as many spots through there.

[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.680]
You know, just sell, sell, sell.

[00:19:59.000 --> 00:19:59.940]
And that's all they care about.

[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.240]
Bad for the talent because just left and right people get blown out.

[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.740]
And of course they don't bother telling anybody.

[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.600]
I mean, entire stations have disappeared.

[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.100]
Entire staff disappeared.

[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.440]
Destroyers of human lives.

[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.840]
That's what you are, Pete Bullgier.

[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.620]
A destroyer of human lives.

[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.760]
Shame on you.

[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.640]
A man that swam in my swimming pool with his wife when I live in Jacaranda.

[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.720]
A man who pretended to be my friend.

[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.520]
And then the moment the opportunity came when it could be a corporate ass liquor

[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.580]
and move up that ladder one more knock stab stab stab.

[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.380]
They could just get that music under the OJs, the backstabbers.

[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.860]
Or just get OJ in here to stab.

[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.720]
He's good at it.

[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.420]
Isn't that ironic by the way that it was the OJs that did the backstabbers?

[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:49.380]
Ironically.

[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:49.880]
Uh-huh.

[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.700]
Yeah, just came to me.

[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.520]
So I don't want to get all melodramatic in everything because like I said,

[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.660]
Sonny and I weren't like tight personal friends but we worked together twice

[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.600]
for over a long period of time and he was a good guy.

[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.080]
And he was treated crapily.

[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.940]
He was treated like absolute positive crap and didn't deserve to be treated like crap.

[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:08.300]
No.

[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.520]
Like I said in this business, the nicer guy you are, the more they do treat you like crap.

[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.640]
But anyway, we're supposed to get all excited about some stupid bulging they're playing in Cubans

[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.060]
on me.

[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.200]
Do I give a crap?

[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:24.520]
No.

[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.420]
Am I going to pay any attention?

[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:25.720]
No.

[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.580]
By the way, Pavel Burry says he'll come back when he's good and ready.

[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.120]
Oh, that that whole deal.

[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.720]
Oh man, talk about stale.

[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.940]
Stale is last year's Mata.

[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.240]
Yeah, Burry says, uh, no, it's not ready.

[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:40.660]
Dinner ready?

[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.640]
No, it's not ready.

[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.760]
So, you know, I'm really debating about that Nashville up Panther game night.

[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.500]
The Predators, which are a pretty good expansion team.

[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.160]
They're kind of an exciting team to watch but I'm debating.

[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.160]
If you're looking for something exciting to do today or night that you know is going to be great,

[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.880]
the action's always how to Hollywood Seminole Gaming or two winners recently walked away

[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.080]
with over 300 grand each.

[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.040]
You could be next, but in order to be a winner, of course, you got to go over there.

[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.180]
Hollywood Seminole Gaming to win.

[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.960]
Play Hollywood Seminole Gaming's 550 gaming machines like Pada Goal,

[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.400]
Lucky Jim's Progressive and More.

[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.940]
48 Rana clock, poker tables featuring a Mahalo, Texas Holderman 7 card stud.

[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.140]
Oh, by the way, kid come to me before the hockey game, you know,

[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.920]
the night says, oh, I love your show and friendly shakes my hand.

[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.560]
And by the way, Buddy Nevin's is my uncle.

[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.880]
And I said, oh, nobody's perfect.

[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.700]
Friday you best good.

[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.600]
There was no farmer who's a Don'ty Rock.

[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:37.120]
He's adding the metal just taking his piss at some boys who were down by the

[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:37.460]
brick.

[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.600]
They're beating the water.

[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:44.320]
There is on their marbles and play things that I'd have passed more.

[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.380]
There came a young lady.

[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.280]
She looked like a pretty young creature.

[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.060]
She sat on the grass.

[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:57.400]
She pulled up her dress and she showed them her rubble and laces and white fluffy

[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:57.760]
duct.

[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:04.720]
She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children so they would not spin.

[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:11.580]
While the boys in the far yard were shoveling refuse and later from yesterday's hunt,

[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.980]
while the girls in the meadow was rubbing her.

[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.300]
I let the fellow down by the dot.

[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:25.060]
He looked like a man with a side of a home in the country with a big fence out front.

[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:31.580]
If he has her phone like Lee, she'd show him her list of bettogs who was subject to

[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.620]
the bettog.

[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:38.780]
And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her smaltender and with a movement so quick.

[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:45.600]
And then she penned over and sucked out his candy so tasty made of butter skies.

[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:52.360]
And then he spread woodcream all over her cookie that she had left out on her shelf.

[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.100]
If you think this is dirty you can go and put yourself.

[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.220]
That's 32 to 560 WQM I would say happy Friday.

[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.520]
There's a podcast over the proceedings here.

[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.480]
George was just saying during the break there couldn't possibly be a god that Jerry

[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.640]
Hursh is dead and people were still alive.

[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.200]
I think that sums it up very nicely.

[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.840]
I think that's exactly that echoes my sentiments.

[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.780]
I second that emotion wholeheartedly.

[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:21.760]
Put it anyway.

[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.420]
Anyhow, Paul Vellbury ate playing tonight and he says I'll play when I'm good and ready.

[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.560]
If not ready yet then maybe it'll be ready a Sunday for that game.

[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.280]
Maybe not like I said the other day could Boston getting a tie last night at one more point

[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.480]
and pulling yet further away further and farther.

[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.780]
And the playoff hopes fading almost into oblivion now.

[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.740]
Maybe when we're officially eliminated that'll be the night that Paul Vell comes back.

[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.540]
Here's a mobile and sunrise. Hello.

[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.000]
Hey, hi Neil.

[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:48.780]
Yes sir.

[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.980]
Good bad news about Sunday.

[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:51.760]
I'm sorry about that.

[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:52.000]
Yeah.

[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.920]
Listen to some good news on page two of the local section.

[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:56.660]
Yes.

[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.980]
Taking check is coming to sunrise.

[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:58.780]
Really?

[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.480]
On 136th of sunrise full of odd.

[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.420]
Which paper in the sense?

[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:03.940]
No, if I am a hero.

[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:04.520]
Oh the hero.

[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:06.980]
In the local section?

[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:07.940]
Yep.

[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:08.940]
The Broward section.

[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.220]
Broward section page two left hand side.

[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:15.280]
Yeah.

[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:16.680]
Here it is.

[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.440]
I look at that.

[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.500]
The TGI Fridays and Stake and Shake will open in sunrise.

[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.800]
Now where's the sunrise going to be?

[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.160]
Like 36th.

[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.960]
Sunrise in 136th Street.

[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.560]
I would have thought that that the Boston market that went out of business there would have been perfect.

[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.260]
But hey, that's just that that's right by the arena by the way, right by the Macarena.

[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.300]
You can walk there.

[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.280]
No data's been set for the opening yet.

[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.180]
However, boy, they're going to that place is going to.

[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.820]
Can you imagine how much money they're going to break in?

[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.280]
I'm telling you.

[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.720]
I was going to in fact, there's a tap at this week.

[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.520]
I just taken shake.

[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.000]
Yeah.

[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.280]
And I had this hard luck of going to the Tampa Bay National game one tonight.

[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.180]
You talk about sleep convincing?

[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:49.620]
Yeah.

[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.240]
Well, somebody had to be there.

[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.100]
So why not you, you know?

[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.080]
Maybe maybe five thousand people to the place.

[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.120]
Maybe.

[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.960]
Meanwhile, you're missing.

[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.660]
You have a great day.

[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:58.460]
Even if I get them.

[00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.140]
Sorry, that's not okay.

[00:25:59.280 --> 00:25:59.500]
Thanks.

[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:00.980]
Okay, so there is some good news.

[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.260]
There's a little bit of a bright light shining out there somewhere somewhere in the land.

[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.280]
Even though mighty Casey is struck out.

[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.680]
Even though they killed Sonny Hersh who died of a broken heart.

[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.360]
Because this business killed him.

[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.980]
See right there, all you people out there that think that I exaggerate.

[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.960]
About this business and I know people of all kinds that for example,

[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.400]
Cal Ripken senior died yesterday at the age of 63 of lung cancer.

[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.620]
Now it's interesting.

[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.720]
Talk about a double standard.

[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.180]
Okay, Joe to Maggio Cal Ripken senior.

[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.420]
Both baseball players, right?

[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.340]
At one time former baseball players, both known for baseball.

[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.120]
And of course, Cal Ripken senior for being the father of Cal Ripken junior.

[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:37.540]
What?

[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.040]
Why are you laughing?

[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.600]
I mean, more people know Cal Ripken junior than the,

[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.820]
forget it, what do you know?

[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.460]
But at any rate, my point is this.

[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.820]
When you read the story here about Cal Ripken senior dying of lung cancer at the age of 63,

[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.140]
it said Ripken senior had a leathered skin and gruff voice,

[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.440]
characteristics at least partially attributable to the fact he was a heavy smoker.

[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:57.860]
No crap.

[00:26:59.080 --> 00:26:59.380]
Right.

[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.160]
Now when the Maggio died or even before that when he had the lung taken out with the cancer

[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.740]
and when he was dying for that public death of his for months and months on it,

[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:14.240]
would anybody ever say anything about him being a three pack of three packs at a by the way?

[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.440]
Anybody ever mentioned that?

[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:15.600]
No.

[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:16.000]
No.

[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.920]
See what a separate standard we have because Cal Ripken senior,

[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.100]
even though he was the father of Cal Ripken junior, he wasn't an icon.

[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.600]
Nobody made any songs about him.

[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.820]
Where have you gone, Cal Ripken senior?

[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.380]
They don't fit in good at all.

[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.820]
Yeah, just doesn't fit in.

[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.640]
See, that could have done some good Joe to Maggio.

[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.600]
I mean, even though he was 84 years old, which in his case was plenty old enough,

[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.800]
but nevertheless, could have done some good discourage all these kids from killing himself with those faggot.

[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.760]
Art Smith, he was the chief engineer at KAT when I went there, old white-haired guy.

[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.840]
Oh boy, we had a transmitter.

[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.620]
All the stuff, you think this stuff here is old?

[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.280]
WKAT, which at that time was on Bay Road there, just off Alton Road there on the beach,

[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:08.240]
had that big gigantic old studio with a picture of old man Frank Katzenstein on the wall.

[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.060]
He was named after the Katzen Times, the KAT.

[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.780]
And of course, his wife, Eucola.

[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.960]
Anyway, isn't that a soft drink, the Eucola, or that the uncola?

[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.400]
Anyway, Eucola, she was the owner at that time.

[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.260]
Sheep bitch.

[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.280]
I wonder if she's dead.

[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.060]
I think she's dead.

[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.080]
Now that's bad, don't say that.

[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.160]
But anyway, she was the owner at that time.

[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.920]
We had this big, big studio, and there was a bird bath outside,

[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.520]
big old drapes up there with a big piano that nobody ever played.

[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:39.480]
And you walked down a hall, way down the hall, and unlike the setup we got now,

[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:44.060]
the studio was in one place, and way, way down the hall upstairs, there was the control room,

[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:47.020]
where the producer was sitting, where Davey Graveline was sitting, ignoring the calls,

[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.560]
and now see, they had to put them through.

[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.100]
We didn't have the same phone.

[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.260]
I've told you this before.

[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.720]
The phones would ring up there, and then they would answer them, and then they have to

[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.620]
like punch them, and then your lines would light up in the talk studio, and you had calls coming in.

[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.260]
So Davey, being, I guess, in those days, he's graduated from those childish days of his.

[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.280]
But he decided he was going to screw me over.

[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:09.220]
He was upset over the fact they took off his at-year service show,

[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.820]
where they used to talk about killing the cockroaches, and how to spray your appendix,

[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.860]
and petunias, you know, all that exciting stuff.

[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.080]
And there were no ratings on it, so they took it off, and they expanded Craig worthy

[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.480]
to four hours, and me to four hours, and they took him off here.

[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.700]
So he became very petrolant about that, and he was the board operator for my show,

[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:25.920]
and he stopped putting the call through.

[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:31.100]
So I had some spies in the building, and one day I was sitting there with like no calls on the board,

[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.920]
doing one of my tirades, and my spy ran upstairs, and sure enough,

[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.540]
every line in the board was ringing, but he wasn't putting them through,

[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.360]
wasn't answering the phone.

[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:43.680]
And I went into a wild major tirade on the year, and all of a sudden,

[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.340]
air of realign in the board.

[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.240]
This is a true story.

[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:50.520]
Every line on my board lit up, and the intercom, there was a red light for the intercom,

[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.020]
and I picked it up so that he could talk to me, said,

[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:53.920]
you happy now?

[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:54.900]
Just slam.

[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.000]
You happy now?

[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.240]
So, uh, where's uh, Davey Gravy's life?

[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.240]
But now he's our good buddy.

[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.980]
So, uh, you know, at past a year, some people eventually grow up.

[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.500]
I don't even hold that against him anymore, because it's so long ago, and by the way,

[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.620]
he did get canned as a result.

[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:11.700]
All right, see?

[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:12.340]
He did.

[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:13.160]
He got fired.

[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:18.680]
But anyway, uh, all right, so we had this big, the old transmitter,

[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:23.280]
and it had the old final tubes, you know, the ones that looked like you were in some kind of

[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:27.300]
arconis, monoconis museum, or something, the big glowing tubes, you know.

[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.060]
Have you ever seen those?

[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.480]
Oh, man, and that, it was a trip just to go back there and look at that stuff.

[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.600]
It was from before radio was ever even invented, it was so old.

[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.080]
That in fact, it's a shame that they, uh, I don't know what that place is now over there on

[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:42.360]
Bay Road.

[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.380]
It's a shame that they ever went out of there, because it was like a radio museum.

[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.660]
Kind of like the stuff we got here.

[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.300]
Only most of this stuff would get thrown out.

[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.960]
He would make it to a radio museum.

[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.600]
Artsmith, he was the white-haired chief engineer.

[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.720]
He was close to buddies with the, I mean, with Jack Horkheimer.

[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.140]
Over there at the space transit plantarium, we all know Miss Horkheimer.

[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.740]
And Joe Fried was our news director.

[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.380]
In fact, Joe Fried, I had lunch at the Merrimard Diner, with Joe Fried.

[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.240]
I had my first interview with Sid Levin before they heard me a K-T,

[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.240]
who was the general manager.

[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.340]
But to make Joe Fried feel like, you know, important, he was the news director.

[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.960]
He wanted me to have lunch with Joe to make him feel like he was involved in the decision

[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.700]
who they were going to hire.

[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:21.960]
I had lunch with Joe.

[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.640]
He was a nice guy.

[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.120]
He was okay.

[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.200]
He was kind of like, well, I don't know.

[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.240]
There's something about that whole K-T was kind of a stale place.

[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:31.780]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.900]
Everybody was kind of like a loof.

[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:36.640]
Did you follow?

[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.100]
Everybody was a loof.

[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.920]
It wasn't like a real friendly place.

[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.500]
It was just a stale.

[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:42.840]
Old.

[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.540]
The audience was old.

[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.000]
The youngest listener we had was a hundred.

[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:48.700]
And they were all dead now anyway,

[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.060]
so I can say whatever I want about them.

[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.640]
Joe Fried, he's dead a lot.

[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.580]
Many years now by the way.

[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.360]
He was okay.

[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:54.800]
He was me.

[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.540]
He had great voice.

[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:03.040]
20 and of course, his apprentice was what's his name that wound up owning the radio station?

[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.220]
I forget his name now already.

[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:04.900]
What that was his name?

[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:05.640]
I forget.

[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.620]
God, talk about him.

[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.780]
The one that was going to get fired there by the senator's wife from the story.

[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.080]
What the hell is his name?

[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.040]
The one that I'm losing it.

[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.400]
I'm so upset with the sonny thing.

[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.600]
Why are you airing shit like this?

[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.020]
And now we see the president getting ready to deliver his address.

[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:24.120]
He's in the oval office with the gold drapes behind him

[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.440]
and he is preparing to address the American people.

[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.300]
Thank you, music place.

[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.880]
My fellow Americans, I have deployed our forces to put up a fight

[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:39.200]
in a place called Kosalov outside of Albania

[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.700]
where all the messes don't use gold.

[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.660]
Right there in Kosalov, we're going to blow away.

[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.820]
Serbian Muslims in the KLA.

[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.060]
Oh, Slopoda by Losevic.

[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.800]
He's mad because his nickname is Slom.

[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.660]
Later, Kosalov recast and hope check the county.

[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:09.940]
Anglago, Hatt, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Harts, Albania,

[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:15.600]
Serbia, Pristina, Adriatic, Zia, Kosovo.

[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.200]
Oh!

[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:29.420]
Amen.

[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.740]
That's 10 stars.

[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.460]
1046 and 560 WQAM.

[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:35.880]
Oh yeah.

[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:36.800]
Making a list.

[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:37.720]
This is morbid.

[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.660]
I'm making a list of all the people I've worked with who've died.

[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:40.720]
Remember Spencer?

[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.880]
Not the car wash Spencer, but dark complex.

[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.340]
Well, I guess they both were dark complex.

[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.780]
The other Spencer that worked for a hot 105 was it?

[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:47.820]
Spencer T. Johnson.

[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.960]
Spencer T. Johnson and he stuck his finger in the wrong place

[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.780]
and got electrocuted.

[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:53.400]
Just a young guy.

[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:54.260]
He's dead.

[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.180]
Larry Kent.

[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:55.960]
Dead.

[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.400]
Jim Harper.

[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.580]
You remember Jim Harper.

[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.680]
He used to, he always had the same purple sweater on.

[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.180]
He used to do all the commercials for,

[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.400]
you've heard his voice all over the market for INZ years ago.

[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:07.580]
Nancy, the receptionist from INZ, dead.

[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:08.320]
Long time ago.

[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.580]
A great friend Bill Calder.

[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:10.560]
Long time ago.

[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.620]
Big Casper.

[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.480]
Great friend.

[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.020]
Great guy.

[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:15.760]
Brilliant radio guy.

[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.560]
I'm wondering, by the way, about certain people.

[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.680]
How about the Prescott Robinson?

[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:20.640]
You think he's still alive?

[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.300]
You know who that was?

[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:22.480]
Steve Daly.

[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.100]
Newsguys, news directors.

[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.040]
You don't remember Prescott Robinson or Steve Daly?

[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.420]
Prescott Robinson, if you've been here long enough and you're old enough,

[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.100]
used to be a news guy on TV.

[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:31.900]
Much less than WS News.

[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:33.860]
See what do you know?

[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:34.940]
You're just a Johnny Conn lately.

[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.220]
A little kid with us.

[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.940]
Those are just some of the people I've worked with who've died.

[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.820]
I'm sure there's some others that I don't even know about.

[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:43.080]
Which, oh, that's just all I need is somebody to call and say,

[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:43.840]
oh, guess what?

[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:44.700]
So-and-so died.

[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.280]
Here, Harry Barry, I think was his name.

[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.620]
Old accounting guy.

[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:49.860]
Worked with KAT.

[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.220]
He was ancient then.

[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.600]
He's got to be dead by now.

[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:53.780]
Harry Barry.

[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.360]
Don't you remember that movie with his brother Barry Barry

[00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.080]
with Warren Beatty?

[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.160]
That's all, all four down?

[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.120]
What was the guy's name that was going to get fired there?

[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.440]
That was Joe Fried's assistant news guy.

[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:06.720]
Howard the Primer.

[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.940]
See, a guy, I got to work these things out myself.

[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.260]
Because you're useless in that area.

[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:10.940]
You're just a bunk.

[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.620]
566-705-60, pound 560-animable-1-9.

[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.160]
Hank will be with you from Tampa, the final four over there.

[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.700]
I'm sure he's having a not too pleasant drive over there after hearing the news about Sunny.

[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:21.700]
They were close friends.

[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.120]
They knew each other for a long, long time.

[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.280]
Sunny stopped in on Hank's show a couple of times just in the last a month or two.

[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.080]
But Hank will be on it too.

[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.720]
6 to 7 we got Donny Beatty and the pregame for the Panthers at 7 o'clock, of course.

[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.080]
And the Panthers in Nashville 730, any interest?

[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:35.520]
No.

[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:39.220]
566-705-60, pound 560-animable-1-line.

[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:43.320]
Heard Hank yesterday was driving up to the track yesterday afternoon and I realized he had

[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.420]
to follow the Marlins, but boy, the phones this week.

[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.280]
And of course you got pace-ah and you got Easter.

[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.760]
Every year this town gets dead and dead and more desperate.

[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:57.400]
And I thought to myself, boy, if Hank is carrying on like a psychotic child about the lack of any kind of response,

[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.740]
what's going to happen tomorrow when we got a full four hours?

[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.360]
One thing when you got a ballgame like we did yesterday, look at this.

[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.280]
Look at this pathetic response.

[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.360]
Here's a mobile and deer field.

[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:06.660]
Hello.

[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.400]
Hi.

[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.240]
How are you doing?

[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:09.880]
Great.

[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:15.880]
Yeah, again, I feel like I'm doing a radio show inside of a dumpster.

[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.560]
That's how I feel living.

[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.280]
Yeah, I know the feeling.

[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.300]
Look, I'm talking to myself.

[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.200]
Well, you know, it's a shame about Sonny.

[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.260]
I mean, that was really sad because I remember him from God.

[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.400]
I only know how long ago.

[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.760]
But you hit the nail on the head.

[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:35.660]
I mean, exactly when you were talking about the FCC doing away with the duopoly rule.

[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.040]
They destroyed this business or they have destroyed this industry.

[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.160]
They have bortured it.

[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.100]
They made it into a joke.

[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:45.420]
And when I said at the time, I said what they've done is they made it like trading baseball cards,

[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:49.820]
you know, Paxton and Clear Channel and Chancellor and all of these others,

[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.740]
Cox, they just keep swapping back and forth flipping baseball.

[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.100]
Oh, here you want this station.

[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.520]
I'll give you this one and these two in Syracuse for these two in wherever.

[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:58.680]
And it's a joke.

[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.180]
And then the process of doing away with all the diversity.

[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:01.560]
Right.

[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.760]
They're ruining the programming.

[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.180]
They're destroying all most of the people we're in the business.

[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:06.720]
That's America, you know.

[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.360]
It would cost on the IOD.

[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.700]
That station was unique.

[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.940]
I mean, the programming was somewhat irreverent,

[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:14.480]
but they had a very firm commitment to news.

[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.280]
That changed when Paxton took it over.

[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.180]
Unlike this place,

[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.320]
that if they were dropping bombs 10 blocks up the street,

[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.200]
somebody would have to run down the street and tell us about it because they have no newswire.

[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.640]
Which is kind of a shame too.

[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:25.900]
Yes.

[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:32.220]
But, you know, I think the whole area of everybody feels bad about the love of the sunny

[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.520]
earth because he was very well known.

[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.660]
I mean, he was he was an institution down here in terms of sports broadcast.

[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:39.820]
And I was going to be missed.

[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:40.200]
Yeah.

[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.480]
Well, I'm not a one on 12 on an old day, you know,

[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.860]
because obviously there's no interest in it.

[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.560]
But, you know, it's a good guy.

[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:45.840]
Okay.

[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.500]
Have a great day, sir.

[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:46.920]
Thank you.

[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.380]
And tune up that phone.

[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:48.880]
Okay.

[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:49.880]
One call on the board here.

[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.540]
One call on the board.

[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:53.940]
I think I'm going to be next.

[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.100]
I think I'm just going to get into car and just I'm not not talking about dead.

[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.740]
I'm just talking about wandering off and just doing a vanishing act.

[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.680]
One call on this board here this morning at 10 to 11 o'clock.

[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.040]
George is looking at the phone.

[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.080]
I'm looking at him.

[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:10.940]
He's looking at me.

[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.380]
Are we on the air?

[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:12.860]
No.

[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.040]
You know, like that brickweaver thing.

[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:15.740]
Are we on the air?

[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.780]
Is there anybody alive out there coming to work this morning?

[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.180]
I noticed I'm thinking where the hell is all the traffic.

[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.640]
This isn't like a holiday weekend yet.

[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.120]
I'm going to tell you every year it's condensing.

[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:31.640]
Pretty soon we'll have the so-called season in South Florida will be a week, a week.

[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:34.800]
And other than that, it's like that's the end of the season.

[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.220]
That's all we got.

[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.140]
Because it used to be, you know, from I went through that yesterday.

[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.220]
Why repeat myself?

[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.100]
I waste the energy.

[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.120]
Every breath you take, like the police say.

[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.880]
Every breath you take is so goddamn valuable.

[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.060]
Why waste the energy on people that don't give a crap?

[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.160]
Oh, it's passed over now.

[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:52.980]
It's an Easter.

[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:53.560]
It's this.

[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.200]
It's that.

[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.460]
The cats got diarrhea.

[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.000]
There's always some excuse here while we've got a bunch of deadheads.

[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.340]
Why this is such a lame ass frickin place.

[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:02.740]
God.

[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.380]
Seriously, the times I have to pinch myself to see if I'm really awake.

[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.240]
If I'm sleeping in, it's a bad dream or not.

[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.620]
And what other want to care?

[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.760]
If I hear one asshole call this show between now and two o'clock,

[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.380]
then what's to talk about that stupid baseball game in Cuba?

[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.200]
I'm going to tell you that's what you're going to hear.

[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.780]
That'll be the symbol that we don't want to hear anymore about it.

[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.440]
That'll be the sign.

[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.360]
That one right there.

[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.740]
Number four, fart number four.

[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.180]
If that's all you have to waste your time thinking about,

[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:35.440]
is the fact that the Baltimore Orioles are playing a ball game in Cuba on Sunday

[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.800]
and some bearded dictator asshole.

[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.500]
If that's what you're wasting your time,

[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.900]
I would suggest a little Andrew Kuhnann will be a good idea, okay?

[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.620]
We'll make sure your picture's getting the paper if you like.

[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:51.340]
Quit wasting the air that living and breathing useful people could be grieving.

[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.740]
Quit wasting the space that those people could be taking up.

[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.520]
Here's a mobile and four-letter, hello?

[00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:58.660]
Hello?

[00:39:58.900 --> 00:39:59.260]
Yes sir?

[00:39:59.720 --> 00:39:59.900]
Neil.

[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.000]
Yes I am.

[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.320]
Okay, just wanted to give a quick call.

[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:08.220]
I wanted to express my appreciation on the Joe Castello show.

[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.600]
And I wanted to congratulate him and a good friend of his.

[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:12.040]
Great.

[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:13.780]
And good night Joe Castello.

[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:14.820]
That's one of our good friends.

[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:15.840]
Hey listen to that.

[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:16.740]
It's fine, right?

[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.400]
And you're great man.

[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.680]
And I think it's a crack about this,

[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.200]
everything that's going around.

[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.760]
You've just got a lot of dead people around.

[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:26.260]
That's right.

[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:26.820]
That's the problem.

[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.680]
Just like the management people in this building, sir.

[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.280]
George is sitting in here again.

[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.420]
They were the broken phone.

[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:33.980]
Not the phone on the ear, but I'm talking about the business phone.

[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.900]
He, anybody calls and he picks up the phone.

[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:36.500]
It goes dead immediately.

[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.120]
This goes on day after day.

[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.360]
We can't do business here.

[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.860]
And we got a bunch of people around here.

[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.960]
You know, same old tired stuff going.

[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.560]
Like that.

[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.300]
You know, that's the response we get here.

[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.140]
No matter what's the, what's broken down?

[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:48.760]
What's the problem?

[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:49.500]
Yeah.

[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.920]
But our program director comes here and changes the schedule.

[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.340]
Tell me Ed Kaplan won't be at the Bahamas or whatever.

[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:57.420]
Like I care about that.

[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:57.680]
Okay.

[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.000]
I mean, Ed is the, Ed is Ed.

[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.040]
You know, plunges brains out wherever he is.

[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.160]
Have a great day pal.

[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:02.900]
You too.

[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.580]
Joe Castello says thank you so much.

[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.080]
Yeah, there's some real good people in this job.

[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.560]
We got a lot of good people in this place.

[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:09.580]
Not too many in management.

[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.980]
Got some people that think they know something.

[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.240]
Of course, I've always had those.

[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.520]
People that thought that he knew.

[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.360]
Like, you know, I don't, I could go down the whole list.

[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.820]
Not going to go down the whole list.

[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.460]
I had some people that knew something like the Casper

[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.520]
who was a real radio guy.

[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.900]
Not just a glorified salesman.

[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.540]
Not just a guy trying to boost up his own ego

[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:31.000]
and pretend to be a radio maven and move her in shaker.

[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.500]
Like some of these guys who think they're moving and shaking it.

[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:35.580]
You know what I mean?

[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.200]
Yeah.

[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:37.680]
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:41.560]
Here's a mobile and four-letter deal, huh?

[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.000]
Hey, Neil.

[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:43.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.540]
Hey, how are you, sir?

[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:44.740]
Great.

[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.160]
We're trying to call for the last couple of days

[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.020]
to get in with this list.

[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:49.960]
I don't know if they've actually mentioned these two.

[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:50.280]

[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.680]
Male secretaries.

[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:52.960]
Male secretary.

[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:53.680]
Excellent, sir.

[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:54.880]
And male nurses.

[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:55.680]
Male nurses.

[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.600]
They always want to take your temperature, Neil.

[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:58.260]
Exactly.

[00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.800]
They always wanted looking at your symptoms.

[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:00.780]
Say for everything's okay.

[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:01.340]
Thank you, sir.

[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:01.880]
Have a great day.

[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000]
And it's one out of two in bed.

[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:03.820]
There's one new one.

[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.000]
Male secretary.

[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.760]
How about the flight attendants?

[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:08.100]
Okay.

[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.440]
Coffee tea or, I'm, it's an old line.

[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.360]
5670560, POM 560 on the mobile one line.

[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:14.860]
I'm depressed.

[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.540]
I felt so good coming in here this morning.

[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.120]
And Dee-Foh comes in here and says,

[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:18.840]
you hear her on the news.

[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:19.940]
And I said, what are you talking about?

[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.280]
Sonny checked out.

[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:25.100]
I mean, it's not like I'm devastated.

[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.920]
It's not like we were close friends.

[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.600]
But just as all of this is starting to sink in, you know?

[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.000]
And then I look around.

[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.540]
I'm watching, you know, the diminishing return here on the phone.

[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.220]
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.820]
You know, you got to, you got to have some kind of

[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.880]
motivational thing that gets you, you know,

[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:45.820]
your juice is flowing.

[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.380]
and that, you know, rubs off out of the audience.

[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.120]
I feel like we're just dying on the vine over here, you know?

[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:56.440]
I understand how boring most of that sports garbage is.

[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:57.600]
It's terminal, man.

[00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.200]
It's enough to put you into a coma.

[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.220]
Just like Michael Mayo, who never apologized to Dave Halberstain.

[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:06.720]
I'm not even going to quote from that stupid columnist this morning, okay?

[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.660]
Even though he has one or two very good points about our boring hockey team,

[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.720]
how terminally are we without Pavel Barini's right?

[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.580]
And if it took away Ray Whitney, I mean, I want to refund.

[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.780]
He's right about that.

[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.100]
So why don't anybody even want to talk about that swill, huh?

[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.480]
But did he ever apologize to Dave Halberstain, Mike Mayo?

[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:25.820]
No.

[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:26.120]
No.

[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.560]
And did Mike Mayo, Dave Halberstain get fired?

[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:29.080]
Yeah.

[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:29.540]

[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.700]
But see, that's the kind of people we got in this town.

[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.760]
Yeah, people are like I said before, if you make a friend someplace else,

[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.600]
very often you have a friend for life.

[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.880]
When you make a friend in South Florida, you have a friend for about a half an hour.

[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.300]
Maybe 20 minutes, all depending on what they look like, you know.

[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.020]
And that's it.

[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.340]
And of course, if you went into a restroom stall and you saw a glory hole there,

[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.380]
what else would you put in there to fill in the hole than wood?

[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:58.100]
Wood?

[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.760]
Space and stands for nothing.

[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.960]
You should get a nice piece of sausage to do for me.

[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.080]
Yeah, what are you going to do with it?

[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:14.000]
I'm going to make you a squeal, like a pit.

[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.100]
You're just going to have to cook, because I hate paint.

[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.360]
You could be nice, Stanker.

[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:21.280]

[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:21.600]
Oh.

[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:22.720]
Give it a hug.

[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:23.840]
Give it a hug.

[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:24.540]
Give it a hug.

[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.040]
Give it a hug.

[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.360]
You should have a pretty mouthdog.

[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:28.200]
Give it a hug.

[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.880]
That's what they call me for.

[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:31.520]
Give it a hug.

[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.400]
Oh, you're rabbit hole.

[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:33.180]
Give it a hug.

[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.300]
Oh, you're rabbit hole.

[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:35.460]
Give it a hug.

[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.240]
Give it a hug.

[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.240]
Hey, 1202 at 560WQAM.

[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:45.740]
Anyway, we were looking scouring this morning to see if we had the old 99 yard that the Sunny Hurts think we have that anymore.

[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:46.100]
No.

[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:46.660]
Long gone.

[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.660]
We'll find it somewhere.

[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.580]
Then there was the thing about the Sunny Hurts go to I&C, long gone.

[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.720]
Then of course, there was still Henry's great piece of passion phones with Sunny Hurts.

[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.200]
Do we have that?

[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:56.680]
No.

[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:57.240]
Long gone.

[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.160]
The only thing I have now, Sunny used it as one thing of his.

[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:03.740]
Everybody's got their little quirks.

[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:08.300]
One thing about Sunny was that as the sports director, especially at IOD, he coveted carts.

[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:09.880]
The sports carts.

[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:20.740]
He was very nervous about anybody from programming your news, any other department going in there and stealing, appropriating the carts that were the sports carts for the sports room in the sports office that they would play the sports activities on.

[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.280]
The little sound bites.

[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.900]
And so Sunny would put S on the cart.

[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:33.980]
And I understand now that all over the market because they recycle these carts and they go back and send them back to the factory to when they wear out and put new tape in them.

[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.520]
And so that we have cart casing.

[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.940]
I have one in my hand right now that's got an S. This is close as I have to anything, even though it doesn't have Sunny's voice on it.

[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:41.660]
I'm not making this up.

[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.540]
It's got these signature Sunny S on it.

[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.740]
And if you would steal a cart because carts are always hard to come by.

[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.560]
Good love it is easy to come by, but carts, that's another thing.

[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:58.020]
And if you would take one of the carts out of the sports room news because you were out of carts, Sunny would lead in the evening if he was around early in the morning or if he was there really early before us.

[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:03.080]
He would come in and he'd look for the carts with the S on it and your stuff would disappear because those were his.

[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.820]
And that was like, and here's the only one that can find it's got the big S on it.

[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.740]
I don't even want to hear about the negative stuff.

[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:10.020]
We got it done.

[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.260]
I mean, how are I?

[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.680]
I don't get what we want to gain.

[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:14.240]
I want to hear nothing negative.

[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:15.840]
I want to read no negative paper.

[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.060]
We finally want to gain.

[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.020]
It's all to be said for rate.

[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.920]
The dolphins want to gain for a change.

[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:24.380]
None of this negative.

[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.280]
And this top two of all of those bulls.

[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:27.280]
I'm tired of the pump.

[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:34.800]
Finally, we can put looking at all the damn stations showing the dolphin demise should Jimmy John's replace you all of those bulls.

[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.560]
I'm tired of the pumps.

[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.920]
I'm tired of.

[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.540]
I'm fed up to hear with this.

[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.200]
Where?

[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:40.480]
Up to here.

[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.780]
This is, you know, it's the grace of God.

[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.680]
You know, I'm sorry for all my profanities.

[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.880]
I'm just happy that we were able to get a win.

[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.380]
Take the first off by no means is just thing.

[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.500]
And we have to continue to concentrate and get ready.

[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:55.720]
So I'm just glad.

[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:57.380]
Could you come in here son?

[00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:58.420]
What is it mom?

[00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.560]
What was that?

[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:01.880]
Oh God.

[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:06.420]
What she wants to clean his ears out with crocs after you heard Brian Cox is string of profanity there.

[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.880]
So that was a sunny first car there with a big S on it.

[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:10.520]
And that's as close as we can get right now.

[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:12.860]
We'll work on it.

[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:14.320]
Here's Miami.

[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:14.640]
Hello.

[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:23.100]
Neil, I don't know if he's dead, but one of your former colleagues that used to talk about jungle bunnies and war with Jerry Wichner.

[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.720]
I understand quite some time ago he had a stroke.

[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:26.180]
Really?

[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:26.940]
Yes.

[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:35.820]
And also Neil, I don't think that was mentioned when Henry Barrow comes on and takes over for the worst team on Monday.

[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:36.600]
Henry Barrow.

[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:37.240]
Yes.

[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.640]
Will he have to work Saturdays like Diffo?

[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:40.320]
Yes.

[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:41.600]
He's got his own trade out show.

[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.320]
They're going to be trading Henry out for booze on Saturdays.

[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:44.920]
Yes sir.

[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.420]
Right immediately after the Diffo trade out show.

[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.380]
Hey listen, don't big ride to these guys.

[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:49.760]
Okay.

[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.420]
They haven't learned to get free stuff as well as we have yet.

[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.340]
They're working on it.

[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.600]
Anything important come over the track?

[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:57.660]
Why do you send him something?

[00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.080]
Wow.

[00:47:59.360 --> 00:47:59.820]
I want to see.

[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.140]
Here's some boring stuff.

[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.020]
What is stuff that comes in on this facts machine?

[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:05.500]
Wow.

[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:07.240]
What is this?

[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:08.460]
What is this?

[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:13.300]
The term an empty wallet.

[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.440]
What does this mean?

[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.220]
What does this mean?

[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:21.980]
Mike.

[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.200]
Woo.

[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.300]
And this guy's a CPA.

[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:28.700]
He sends me a facts that I mean I couldn't make header tails of this if you stuck a gun in my mouth.

[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:29.880]
I can't figure it out Mike.

[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:30.500]
I'm trying.

[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.040]
Is Lee baby Sims dead?

[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:36.700]
He was on love 94 and ran into many personal problems.

[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.340]
Remember this guy?

[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:37.760]
No.

[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:38.320]
Do you remember him?

[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:38.860]
No.

[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:39.900]
Is he dead?

[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:40.680]
Do we know if he's dead?

[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:40.840]
No.

[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.520]
Somebody will call.

[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.920]
So I leave anybody out?

[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:48.640]
Did anybody call to tell us if Presta Robinson or Steve Daley are dead or alive yet?

[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:50.120]
No.

[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.520]
Did you work with Big Wilson?

[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:53.580]
No but I knew Big.

[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.040]
Oh no.

[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:54.820]
He was a good guy.

[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:55.740]
They'll call to work for him.

[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:56.820]
I knew Big very well.

[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.000]
He was not a good guy.

[00:48:59.020 --> 00:48:59.980]
He was a great guy.

[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.620]
Great guy.

[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.660]
Used to play the piano with the old New York steakhouse.

[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.180]
See I know that all of us old parts like me we like to indulge ourselves in us stows in the good old days.

[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:16.520]
So you know something this town today compared, when I got here in 76 it was already going downhill.

[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.680]
But now it is compared to what it was.

[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:26.060]
Don't give me 10 blocks of art deco and a bunch of steroid laden posing fags and hot shot movie stars.

[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:29.080]
Don't pretend that that's a substitute for what this town used to be.

[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.940]
New York steakhouse.

[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.980]
And the guy that started that place he did too by the way.

[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:35.060]
Which I can't take it his name.

[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:37.080]
Big Wilson did.

[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.280]
Now what did a lot of people, these people have in common?

[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:41.920]
Fat.

[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:42.420]
That's right.

[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.260]
So I don't want to start lecturing, Boog.

[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:45.340]
Okay.

[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:46.100]
Or your default.

[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.820]
I don't want to start lecturing out of my blood sugar this morning.

[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:50.800]
78 George.

[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:51.560]
78.

[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.500]
How do you like that?

[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.520]
Not losing weight all that fast.

[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.960]
It's not exactly pouring off, but I'm it's inching on the way it's in the right direction.

[00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:58.880]
78.

[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.580]
Because I'm finally realizing that so you know as it gets closer to the end you just can't screw around anymore.

[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.000]
All that fish food, all that crap I was eating.

[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.420]
I mean who the hell am I kidding?

[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:10.720]
Who am I kidding?

[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.000]
Nobody.

[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.940]
Just like that spot used to say you can't fool mother nature baby.

[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.240]
But big Wilson he was big.

[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:22.380]
He was a monster in the broadcasting industry.

[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:22.800]
Dead.

[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.520]
So many of these people.

[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:26.280]
And sunny.

[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.920]
You know, sunny was never fat.

[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.680]
Boog and George and I were talking about this this morning.

[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:32.260]
Sunny Hersh was never fat because he was a big guy.

[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.940]
But he was always chunky.

[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:37.500]
Not not fat like with a big pupic like that kind of fat.

[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:38.600]
But always heavy.

[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:39.280]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.960]
And then of course when you're heavy and you've already got stress on the organs and the people over there

[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:47.600]
that you're working for are stressing you out and stringing you along.

[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:49.620]
I wonder how they feel over there today.

[00:50:49.780 --> 00:51:00.120]
You know, I wonder how Rhonda Wolf and Pete Bolder and all those other management types that refused to tell this guy the truth and that strung him along and made him a laughing stock in the industry.

[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:09.260]
By the way they treated him firing somebody in the media with all the speculation that was going on day in and day out and very jackass writing this and writing that.

[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:10.860]
I wonder how they feel over there now.

[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:15.200]
Of course I know how bolder feels because where there's no sense there's no feeling.

[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:20.260]
And when you've screwed over as many people as he has you reached the point I guess you don't care anymore.

[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:27.880]
There's only one thing I want to ask you today Pete when it comes to you and your cohorts over there at queer channel broadcast.

[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.100]
Anybody have a heart or a liver?

[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:34.580]
Oh look at that Greg Read got a bad haircut Jesus Christ you look like you ran into a lawnmower.

[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:40.120]
Now you know something if he went and got a haircut that means he had to get close to a barber and he's got mono.

[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.680]
Oh that's right now he says you're right I didn't do it.

[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:44.200]
I got under the lawnmower right.

[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:45.320]
Good choice.

[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.140]
Well I was good so he did it because he don't want to spread that disease anymore.

[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.880]
And by the way Joe Costello is back in healthy don't get near him anymore.

[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:54.880]
In fact if you get near Joe Costello you just kind of hang in the back of the room and pretend you don't know him.

[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:59.280]
Nice suit though Greg is that a new suit?

[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.100]
That's a nice suit.

[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:05.520]
That's what I just said if you were listening to me and sitting at the hand I just said it's a nice suit.

[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:06.140]
Or money.

[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:07.860]
Oh and our money.

[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:09.820]
Oh man now we know where the money is going.

[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:11.180]
Okay.

[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:18.200]
Nine minutes after 11 at 560 WQA I'm serious about what is happening to that man?

[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:24.120]
He got a haircut it looks like somebody just took a little like a baby suit on those little pinky sheers you know.

[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.420]
And just did a little choppin here and there it's like pointing in all different directions now.

[00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:31.180]
Man he looks bizarre.

[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:37.220]
He's a bizarre guy that Greg read but anyway it's Friday you best good.

[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:43.620]
Robin Williams is had chat us the time to use this humor as medicine.

[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:47.240]
What's the news on our little boy?

[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:55.440]
Well Mr. Mrs. Smith your son has rectal colon cancer and he's going to be dead soon.

[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.040]
Oh good no.

[00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.220]
Hey pull my finger what you think?

[00:52:59.420 --> 00:52:59.700]
What?

[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:00.940]
Ah pull my finger.

[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:01.240]
Hey.

[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:02.900]
Come on pull it.

[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:03.740]
Okay.

[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:05.820]
Okay.

[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:06.420]
Whoa.

[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:08.680]
Come on use medicine.

[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:09.560]
Manu Nano.

[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.340]
Bad Adams the doctor with laughs.

[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.700]
You've got AIDS.

[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:15.660]
Whoa.

[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.020]
Yay that one.

[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:19.620]
So now it's going to be a little bit easier to do with my finger.

[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:19.680]
No.

[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:19.680]

[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:21.260]
Wait.

[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:21.260]

[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:22.080]

[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:22.080]

[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:22.660]

[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:22.980]
Wait.

[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:23.440]
Wait.

[00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:25.540]
Why do we think of the doctor field?

[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:28.120]
Did I ever get any more of those test results from my doctor?

[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:28.500]
No.

[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.640]
Doctor Patch?

[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:29.880]
No.

[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:33.680]
I just mentioned that in passing since it's now Friday 9 days later.

[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.600]
It's 11.15 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:37.880]
We got 200 open lines for it.

[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.940]
Here's today's letter to the editor by the way.

[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:42.360]
Everyday we got at least one that's really an asked letter.

[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:44.600]
That's with a capital ASS.

[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.720]
Edward Forens in Delray Beach, right?

[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.900]
I should say old Edward.

[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.380]
Oh, and Delray Beach, huh?

[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:52.780]
We'll have to play that, won't we?

[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:53.560]
Sitting at a branch?

[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.400]
Yes, we'll have to play that.

[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:58.560]
Columbus, often abusive toward senior citizens,

[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.700]
is the heading to put up a Edward's letter.

[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.500]
It's his, Ray, the March 21st column by John Grogon,

[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:06.900]
servers issued up reward, good work.

[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:08.080]
I object.

[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.060]
I strenuously object.

[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:11.880]
This guy must know I'm Mr. R. R. What's his name?

[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:15.880]
With a big black eye named Schmembering.

[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.660]
I strenuously object to Mr. Grogon,

[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:20.460]
repeatedly panning senior citizens.

[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.880]
He talks about senior citizens' failure to tip

[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.260]
and stealing sweet and low.

[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:26.820]
At a board meeting of our condominium association,

[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.300]
we discussed the treatment of seniors.

[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:30.800]
We hope something can be done to stop this abuse

[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.020]
by this columnist.

[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:35.920]
At a board meeting of the condo commando said

[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.840]
around at the board meeting, and they said,

[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:38.480]
Oh!

[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:39.540]
What are we going to do?

[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:41.860]
Maybe we will drop a resolution like the individual

[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:43.380]
who did in the hell and they'll 100 years ago

[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.620]
to get Neil Rogers off the air.

[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:45.100]
Didn't it work?

[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:45.440]
No.

[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:45.740]
No.

[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:49.180]
Let's get John, in fact, John Grogon is one of the few

[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:51.060]
people who occasionally writes a column in his town

[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.160]
that makes any sense.

[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.520]
Like when he ripped the Catholic church a couple of times.

[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:54.820]
Oh!

[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.020]
He was raised a Catholic.

[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.580]
Hey Edward, I hate to break the news to you old fart.

[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:02.200]
Oi!

[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:04.380]
Stealing sweet and low.

[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:05.600]
Wonder where John Grogon got that?

[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:07.820]
Wonder where he got that.

[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.180]
Have a nice day, by the way.

[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:09.880]
John, have a great week.

[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:11.340]
I'm sure listening to the show right now.

[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.500]
The senior citizens, I'll say it again for the 50 millionth time.

[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.460]
I'll say it as long as I possibly can, no matter where you go

[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:19.960]
in the world.

[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.440]
There are young people, there are old people, there are people

[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.960]
in between, there are people in every demographic group.

[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:28.460]
But the place is an overrun by crotchety old fart.

[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:32.260]
Except a few places, and one of them is here.

[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:32.700]
Ow!

[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:33.520]
Right.

[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.320]
You can go out to Sun City.

[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:38.160]
You can go to Tucson.

[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:39.820]
Huh?

[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:44.960]
There are a handful of places in America that are for people waiting to die.

[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.500]
Some of them have already died.

[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:47.640]
Just nobody told them.

[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.560]
This is one of them.

[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:52.700]
And the rest of us here, by the way, we've ended bitterly.

[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.340]
I've presented it since the day I came here 23 years ago.

[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:58.600]
And until I stick my fat ass in the ground, I'll continue to resent it.

[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:01.640]
The fact that we have a bunch of nasty, rotten old people.

[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.840]
I mean, some of the old people are nice.

[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.120]
My mother's nice, that's about it.

[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:08.420]
But other than that, who want everybody else to be as miserable as they are,

[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.280]
or want to stick to those, and everybody else's business,

[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.660]
or our upside-down, there's everybody chucked, there's a good guy.

[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.540]
If you're a younger, or whatever, you want to go to the subcenter, get a great meal.

[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:19.700]
With our fantastic lunch today, thank you, sir, and our Chuck bringing our lunch.

[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:21.920]
And see we get service here with a smile.

[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:22.780]
That's the way we do it.

[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.160]
Thank you, sir, and have a great weekend.

[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:25.820]
Thanks, Chuck.

[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:30.180]
Subcenter, corner 441 and I, as they wrote, best meets, best everything.

[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:31.040]
They're great.

[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:32.080]
They love us.

[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.980]
Nesee Chuck, they're gone to miss school over there.

[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:34.800]
They're fantastic.

[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.920]
See, like I told you, there's some nice people around.

[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:40.620]
And of course, they're not old.

[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:42.600]
What, what do you look at?

[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:44.400]
I'm just, oh, you just curious, is what this is?

[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.740]
Yeah, that's about it.

[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:47.620]
Oh, it's exactly what I want.

[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:48.520]
It's what the doc is.

[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:49.040]
Oh, it's okay.

[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:49.880]
It's got that birthday.

[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.660]
It can act in this perfect lunch.

[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.120]
Cheese and onions on some tuna.

[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.480]
Because the meatballs, come way back and I read meat, you know?

[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.680]
Cutting way down on that.

[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:00.120]
You can do that, kids, without all that meat.

[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.540]
Plus tomorrow, I have it a big steak.

[00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:02.760]
And you know who's buying, don't you?

[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:03.880]
Or is it who claims he's buying?

[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.280]
Anybody believe Rimmer's buying?

[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:07.020]
That's what he says.

[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:09.280]
He'll probably come down, have a relapse with it.

[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:11.220]
You know, it'll be sick again tomorrow.

[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:13.660]
Here's a mobile in D'Areal.

[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:13.940]
Hello.

[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:14.620]
Hello.

[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:15.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:16.420]
No mobile.

[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:17.300]
This is Mark in D'Areal.

[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:18.800]
Like I said, here's Mark in D'Areal.

[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:19.920]
Not on a mobile.

[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.600]
Hey, Neil, the good old days with Prescott Robinson and Big Wilson.

[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:24.180]
Remember that?

[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.580]
I remember he used to do 51 with a can of all night movies.

[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:28.900]
What did I do with my old eruders?

[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:29.320]
Yeah, go ahead.

[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:32.960]
He used to do the old movies playing the piano with a little outlaw.

[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.980]
The night owl, he'd be sitting at the piano table.

[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:39.000]
He'd be tinkling under piano, like I used to say, and the bumbling around in there.

[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:40.020]
He was a good guy.

[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:40.120]

[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:40.400]
He was a good guy.

[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:43.540]
The owl that he had on top of his piano and different costumes.

[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.740]
You remember the owl on the piano?

[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:46.760]
Yes, that's what I just said.

[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.480]
And Prescott Robinson, yep.

[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:49.300]
If he did.

[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:52.820]
I don't know if he's alive or not, but he was not fat.

[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.180]
And he was a big one.

[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:55.620]
He was a good one.

[00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:56.540]
No, absolutely not.

[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:57.180]

[00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:58.300]
that's the problem were so isolated

[00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:58.440]
that's the problem were so isolated

[00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.040]
So isolated from reality.

[00:58:59.460 --> 00:58:59.760]
That's the problem were so isolated

[00:58:59.760 --> 00:58:59.760]

[00:58:59.760 --> 00:58:59.760]

[00:58:59.760 --> 00:58:59.760]

[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:01.480]
No indication any related to the

[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:02.320]
anten.

[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:07.240]
them to什么 Fast Holder,

[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:16.920]
was a fastcause he was a fast.

[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.400]
night so he must have either who knows what the deal is but George Brennan did we see him last night

[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:26.080]
was he driving no no maybe we won't see him no more but I mean there's a major sports story

[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:29.720]
of course this is the sports station do they know anything about harness racing on his station

[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:33.320]
no every now and then they're doing a show from Poppano Park do they know anything about it no

[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:38.460]
we get any news about that thing at freehold raceway no we're so isolated here

[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:44.180]
like I've said before you know one good thing if you grew up here as a kid you never had to go

[00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:48.440]
through this no storms in a sleep and all the head colds in the summertime all you know all of

[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:53.220]
that but on the other hand you never had a chance like talking about radio for example

[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:59.840]
here all the great stations in those days wavc and wls and wjr Detroit and w all those stations all

[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:07.760]
a km elections in St. Louis with all the sports wkbw and wbz and Boston radio down here was

[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:16.860]
strictly a cacophony of no speak at the englace and you're so isolated being down here on

[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:22.040]
this penicilla from the rest of the human race down here that there's no good that's why there's

[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.740]
so many parochial people here they've never been anywhere they don't go anywhere they don't know

[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:31.020]

[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:22.200]
mean maybe the other people on the station don't care maybe they're kind of willing to set back

[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.800]

[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.460]

period when I first came here I thought us was q a m but it's very very clear for anyone to see

[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:37.760]
even Johnny Nash is saying I can see clearly now that it's strictly like two different worlds remember

[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:43.560]

[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:04.460]
you'll see I've been through these peaks and hills and valleys these peaks of 20

[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:12.160]
shares all through these years yeah take a peek like I said if you want to fill out glory hole

[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.240]
what better than wood

[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.200]
oh

[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:23.700]
the other night I watched a wrestling match oh it's big smooth men with sweaty crack

[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:31.220]
a ride they would try to grab each other's ass there's nothing more than a tiny g-strap

[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:43.220]
but when they ran the bells and the match was over I couldn't help but notice I had a

[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:53.180]
big folder I want a ring a wrestler and have a man's crotch wrapped around my mouth

[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:56.280]
welcome I want a ring a wrestler

[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:04.540]
pushing inside and out so I admit it seems a little gay

[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:07.900]
it's my hand between the mother and play

[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:13.680]
oh and I pull my hands away I get to sell my fingers

[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:26.320]
you know that other than sometimes you train you don't need to have much of a brain as long as in the shower after you work out

[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.720]
you don't have to place in someone balls in your mouth

[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:35.820]
I know that white sleeves can be messy and too melty

[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:43.040]
that's why they like to grow fat K-Y on their filly

[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:54.080]
I want to be a wrestler and retaining more arms just like you I want to be a wrestler

[01:06:54.080 --> 01:07:02.780]
and maybe run for governor too as long as it attracts the crowd

[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:13.280]

[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:29.120]
at five sixty w came in at Georgia's really just shaken he was a good guy he was a good guy he

[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:32.800]
was nice to the underling when I was an underling he was nice to everybody everybody got along

[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:37.100]
with sunny I don't remember sunny ever saying a bad word about anybody any having any kind of a

[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:40.860]
conflict although I know I do remember one story about him get I don't remember what it was

[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:45.720]
about that's why it stands out in my mind one time I guess he went ballistic about something

[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:49.820]
went into Bob Green and just jumped up and down like I don't remember what it was about but other

[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:54.480]
than that in all those years it just didn't happen because he was a very easygoing guy well

[01:16:54.480 --> 01:17:00.360]
like by everybody and they he died a broken man they broke his spirit because the one thing that

[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:07.160]
mattered to him in life was being the voice of the university Miami sports was there a problem

[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:11.380]
with that no no of course there are a bunch of backstabbers too how come I left them out is if I

[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:15.780]
don't know that remember that when Hank and I were going to do that game when the sunny was

[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:21.040]
out Rick Weaver had to go somewhere whatever was and sunny white to do a dolphin game to fill in

[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:25.320]
for Rick Weaver some weekend so we had a U of M baseball game to broadcast I only broadcast U M

[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:30.060]
baseball for six years by the way ended a spectacular job by everyone's account even my Grozen

[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:35.820]
tall so they were going to have me do the a play by play and Hank do the color we thought be a

[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:39.780]
lot of fun Hank was doing nights and I would be at that time we were looking forward to it and

[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:44.200]
university Miami Blue Noses one or two of those assholes over there one or two of those homophobic

[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:48.720]
assholes there no we don't want him we don't want to knock it over so Mike Disney to his credit said

[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:53.720]
okay well if that's the case we just won't broadcast the game at all nice going this how do you

[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:58.640]
like that because there's a lot of assholes over there at that university Miami that's my opinion

[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:05.560]
I'm like Disney right exactly right F and A so don't leave them out because they also stabbed him

[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:09.740]
in the back they're the ones who responsible all what we feel we need to make a change yeah no

[01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:16.340]

[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:07.200]
baptis when a yellow is goody two shoes phonies when they have a convention where they go vagus

here's a bokeh hello yes sir listen when i'm in New York i want you to know that

[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:27.140]
i listen to your my computer i think it's great excellent what i had a dollar for everybody

[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:30.720]
it's listening on the audio and at all over the world right now i could buy lunch tomorrow no kidding

it's really great on a your card you can go back a month or whatever it's really terrific listen

[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:39.700]
let me ask you something at night how come like after midnight there is you can get nothing on

[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:45.100]
the radio appear in bokeh access fantasations because you're supposed to be sleeping no but it

[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:51.880]
means that i cut the signal down or they do do something what happens there uh-huh they have to

[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:58.180]
after sundown is there right yes that's nothing new that's been uh i know that it is but what's the

[01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:02.520]
reason i don't understand them make specials because at night the atmosphere is thinner so radio

[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.320]
signals travel farther and they interfere with each other so protect the other signals that are

[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:09.900]
that's the way we got to do it so i get absolutely nothing except spanish stations and for

[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:15.000]
right so that's a good time to put in those uh cassettes right okay pal thanks good luck

[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:30.920]
no my father was in entered in the hospital back in January of 98 and they were supposed to do a

[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:37.280]
procedure on his crowded artery crowded in dark directory right or anyway uh he plotted

[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:44.080]
the surgeon came back and first out the uh technician in the emergency room he says what in the

[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:52.120]

[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:08.980]
He'll have them to be thin.

[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:12.640]
And give them food a lit.

[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:17.980]
Say you ever thought a half a scene, my balls are big and salty and brown.

[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:23.280]
And you ever need a quick pick me up, just stick my balls in your mouth.

[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:26.040]
That's all my chop, let's start that ball.

[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:28.900]
All right, put him in my bin, suck him.

[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:33.840]
Suck him, my job, miss out this ball.

[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:36.040]
The effect was a good list.

[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:37.600]
High five, huh?

[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:50.180]
Hey, wait a minute.

[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:51.500]
Who gets mail?

[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:55.500]
You smell like so-toothed burnin'.

[01:50:57.780 --> 01:50:59.200]
Well, that don't for fun, Mina.

[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.900]
Now that I get my red pain on fire.

[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:06.480]
If you better get back at the kitchen,

[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:10.760]
cause I got a sneak in suspicion.

[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:13.680]
Oh, man, baby.

[01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:17.700]
Baby, you just burned my bow.

[01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:21.160]
I got my, my bow's on fire.

[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:22.460]
The fire's on fire.

[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:24.420]
The fire's on fire.

[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:26.560]
Give it to one.

[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:28.000]
Push the one over.

[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:29.440]
The fire's on fire.

[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:30.700]
I'm sick of this.

[01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:32.680]
I'm full of the fire and do something.

[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:37.320]
Oh, suck on my job, miss out this ball.

[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.360]
Put him in my bed, suck him.

[01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:41.820]
Help my baby.

[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:45.280]
Suck on my job, miss out this ball.

[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:46.760]
Put him out, baby.

[01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:47.900]
Blow.

[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:52.940]
Suck on my bow, baby.

[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:56.780]
Suck on my bow, baby.

[01:51:58.160 --> 01:51:59.800]
Suck on my bow, man.

[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:02.820]
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:03.500]
Come up here, miss.

[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:05.800]
Whoa, whoa, stop my bow.

[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:12.780]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:14.900]
Twenty-two-one is five.

[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:15.200]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:15.200]

[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:15.820]
Here's a challenge to be young,

[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:18.000]
since that call themselves Rances.

[01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:18.760]
Sixty.

[01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:20.580]
WQA in.

[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:25.600]
There was no farmer who lived on a rock.

[01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:29.420]
He's adding the metal just shaking his fist

[01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:32.500]
that some boys who were down by the frick.

[01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:36.560]
There being the waters there is on their marbles

[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:39.320]
and play things and at half past four.

[01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:41.300]
There came a young lady.

[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:44.260]
She looked like a pretty young creature.

[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:46.040]
She sat on the grass.

[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:50.240]
She pulled up her dress and she showed them her rubbles

[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:52.760]
and leases and white fluffy duck.

[01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:57.860]
She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children,

[01:52:58.180 --> 01:52:59.700]
so they would not spit.

[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:02.700]
While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling,

[01:53:03.380 --> 01:53:06.560]
wrapped you thin layer from yesterday's hunt.

[01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:10.000]
While the girl in the meadow was rubbing her,

[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:13.240]
I let the fellow down by the dot.

[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:18.360]
He looked like a man with a size of a home in the country

[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:20.020]
with a big fence out front.

[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:23.640]
If he asked her for likely she'd show him her

[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:26.920]
little pet dog who was subject to bits.

[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:31.300]
And maybe she'd let him wrap hold of her small tender

[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:33.740]
and with a movement so quick.

[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:37.660]
And then she'd bend over and suck out his candy

[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:40.860]
so tasty made of butter, Scotch.

[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.560]
And then he'd spread with cream all over her cookies

[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:47.340]
that she had left out on her shelf.

[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:51.200]
If you think this is dirty, you could go to yourself.

[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:54.080]
I'll tear you.

[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.880]
1246 is 560 WQM.

[01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:58.800]
I'll tell you we're going to have a lot of music in here

[01:53:58.800 --> 01:53:59.700]
between now and two.

[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:03.000]
And I understand I realize that when the town dries up,

[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.020]
there's not much you can do about it, not much we can do about it.

[01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:07.800]
So why not, I'm not going to stress myself out like Sonny Hirsch.

[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:09.720]
I'm going to kill myself for this crowd.

[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:10.080]
No.

[01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:12.560]
No, you want to call me, got 400 open lines.

[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:15.020]
And a morning show, the afternoon show, this show,

[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:17.420]
the nighttime show, we got a bunch of dead heads out there.

[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:20.100]
I got the lady in Phoenix back on here.

[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:20.740]
I got the...

[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:21.740]
I would tear you.

[01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:22.960]
Lady back on.

[01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:25.800]
That was my evil twin that called you.

[01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:26.800]
You're likely to be stirring.

[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:28.240]
So I don't like this.

[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:29.320]
I got a call from Phoenix.

[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:30.840]
Dave Broward and Palm Beach and Monroe.

[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:31.660]
They're a four-mire.

[01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:32.420]
They're not interested.

[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:34.540]
But the Phoenix lady, she's a superstar now.

[01:54:34.780 --> 01:54:35.540]
She's calling again.

[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:36.760]
Yes, I am.

[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:39.860]
I want you to spread the word since you're outside of the state of Florida.

[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:43.740]
Spread the word of the free world that Florida has officially died the last two weeks.

[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:44.740]
This town has died.

[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:45.920]
From what?

[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:47.480]
Yeah, I have no idea.

[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:48.440]
Go ahead, ask me.

[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:49.140]
Oh.

[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:49.880]
Just died.

[01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:52.180]
Anyway, let's talk about sports.

[01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:52.700]
No.

[01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:53.460]
No.

[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.040]
Specifically hockey.

[01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:55.660]
No.

[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:56.420]
Why?

[01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:58.120]
Because nobody here cares about hockey.

[01:54:58.440 --> 01:54:58.840]
Why not?

[01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:00.020]
You're against them.

[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:00.540]
I don't know.

[01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:02.020]
I haven't been working here 100 years.

[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:02.980]
I don't know what they care about.

[01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:04.100]
hockey's out one of them.

[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:05.580]
Well, I'll have a pass.

[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:05.680]

[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:06.720]
We got a $10 million dollar.

[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:07.800]
I don't care about basketball.

[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:09.380]
We got a $10 million dollar hockey player.

[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:10.900]
He says, I'll come back when we're ready.

[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.560]
We're on the verge of being eliminated from the playoffs.

[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:13.680]
It's not ready yet.

[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:15.260]
I'll let you know when I'm ready to come back.

[01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:16.580]
What about...

[01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:18.780]
I remember Bob Bond scores the winning goal for Lisa

[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:19.920]
and the playoffs against Detroit.

[01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:21.200]
Playing on a broken ankle.

[01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:24.160]
This guy's got a, you know, a sore on his knee.

[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:26.060]
And he'll be back when he's good and ready, you know.

[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:29.000]
What can you do to bring Steve Barnes back?

[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:30.280]
We don't need Steve Barnes.

[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:30.960]
We got Ray Winning.

[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:31.840]
Have a nice day, sweetheart.

[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:34.200]
Oh my god.

[01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:36.420]
Oh god.

[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:39.040]
Oh.

[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:39.500]

[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:43.580]
See, she called the other day.

[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:44.180]
It was funny.

[01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:45.060]
It was amusing, okay?

[01:55:45.260 --> 01:55:46.260]
I would dare you.

[01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:48.160]
That big fat cow called from Phoenix.

[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:48.760]
But don't worry about that.

[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:48.760]

[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:48.760]

[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:48.760]

[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:48.760]

[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:48.760]

[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:49.860]
Don't push it.

[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:52.400]
Obviously she's got a little problem there.

[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.040]
She wants an ego.

[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:56.560]
She wants a life.

[01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:57.620]
We can't make it for her.

[01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:58.240]
We can't invent it.

[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:00.120]
Any more we can invent a life for the people right here in town.

[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:00.940]
We don't have one.

[01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:01.700]
Which is most of them.

[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:04.000]
Last chance, okay.

[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:04.860]
I got some great stuff.

[01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:07.060]
I mean, you thought that rambler, man, which I love that, by the way.

[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:09.380]
You'll see those two pre-sitting there in the bar.

[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:11.880]
Founding each other under the table.

[01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:14.360]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:16.420]
Count 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:18.540]
Here's the mobile in South America.

[01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:20.540]
What was that?

[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:24.040]
No, don't even waste your time, okay?

[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:25.340]
Don't even waste the effort.

[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:28.500]
Here's the mobile in sunrise.

[01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:28.840]
Hello?

[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:30.020]
Hello?

[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:30.640]
Yes, sir.

[01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:33.780]
I had my listen to the first team lately.

[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:35.080]
I understand they're going off the air.

[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:35.440]
Yes.

[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:37.720]
Could you tell me something about the program that's going on?

[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:39.460]
It's Monday morning, six o'clock, sir.

[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:40.320]
That's all I can tell you.

[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:41.160]
You'll really enjoy it.

[01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:42.900]
Here's the mobile in Washington.

[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:43.220]
Hello?

[01:56:44.420 --> 01:56:44.880]
Honey, oh.

[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:45.440]
Yes, sir.

[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:46.640]
Last call of the day.

[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:47.740]
I hope not.

[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:48.340]
You're in.

[01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:49.300]
Yeah, I'm in.

[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:49.980]
You're in.

[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:51.960]
Well, about the assistant brain doctor.

[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:55.120]
My brother had brain cancer, had a great doctor.

[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:57.020]
And his name was Dr. Stone.

[01:56:57.140 --> 01:57:00.420]
It worked out of the Broward County Hospital.

[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:06.860]
And second thing, the listening to you, the end majors had the Haitians

[01:57:06.860 --> 01:57:08.960]
picketing outside the Steregrino station.

[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:13.040]
And I was getting the radio waves.

[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:16.860]
And I was listening to another, he went to Amsterdam station.

[01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:19.100]
And then they said something about scan majors.

[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:21.320]
I caught him, he went off the air, and that's when I caught him.

[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:22.120]
Yeah.

[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:29.060]
So, then, tell me, you got a Panther fan, a deceiving chick, it's the end of all the places.

[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:31.100]
Oh, yeah, we got a lot of Panther fans, Pell.

[01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:35.060]
We got a $10 million guy who's not going to play when we definitely need him to still have a chance to play off.

[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:37.320]
And nobody in this town has got anything to say about it.

[01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:38.540]
I'm the only one that's got an opinion.

[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:39.920]
That's what this town is all about.

[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:40.880]
What's a deadhead, sir?

[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:44.860]
They'll show up there tonight and they'll be talking to each other and holding their babies up in front of my face

[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:46.720]
and waving across the arena to each other.

[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.020]
It's pathetic.

[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:49.060]
It's all make-believe.

[01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:52.040]
Just like Tom and I said, it's only make-believe.

[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:54.560]
It's been good for me because I have up the level of seats.

[01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:56.660]
I've been sitting in the lower table last 10 games.

[01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:57.000]
Yeah.

[01:57:57.700 --> 01:58:00.740]
And so, I get down there for the fight for the upper bowl.

[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:02.120]
So, it's been good for me.

[01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:02.880]
Well, good for you.

[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:03.740]
I'm happy for you.

[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:04.400]
It's your ever-great day.

[01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:07.520]
I mean, if that came to the end of the night, it was good for any of us to have an help us.

[01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:08.540]
5, 6, 7.

[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:09.420]
Any interest today?

[01:58:09.620 --> 01:58:10.220]
Last chance.

[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:11.400]
Last opportunity.

[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:12.420]
It proved that I'm wrong.

[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:12.800]
Okay.

[01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:21.220]
To prove there's some life that we got a few people out there that somebody's got something to say about anything, about Passover, about Pavel Breh, about any goddamn thing in the world.

[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:28.100]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:33.360]
We're pushing, we're pressing, we're squeezing, we're reaching, we're feeling, we're grabbing, are we coming up with anything?

[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:33.640]
No.

[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:34.740]
No, we're probing.

[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:38.680]
Man, oh my, get the flashlights out.

[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:39.980]
Let's have a search party.

[01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:45.880]
Let's open up the door and go up and down 441 to see if we find anybody alive who isn't some kind of a banana boat drifter.

[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:50.500]
5, 6, 7, 05, I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait till we got a whole bunch of money.

[01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:52.660]
I'm, I'm yet to be convinced.

[01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:57.800]
What I've seen go and I've said, and every day it gets worse, that's the best part.

[01:58:58.100 --> 01:58:59.280]
Each day at the Terrier Race.

[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:02.620]
Yesterday we almost had Hank do in suicide at 530.

[01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:05.900]
It's not bad enough he's got to follow a Marlon exhibition, and that's not bad enough.

[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:11.300]
They just leave him hanging out there to drive this audience, just like they're doing to me today.

[01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:16.080]
And yesterday, and the 84 that end last week and a half, last two weeks since we came into this room.

[01:59:16.420 --> 01:59:17.940]
That's what they're pissed off about this room.

[01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:20.700]
Don't ask me why, can they see the room?

[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:21.620]
Huh?

[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:23.180]
No, but they're pissed about it.

[01:59:24.020 --> 01:59:28.980]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 560 on a mobile one line.

[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:30.840]
I'm just gonna sit back in the chair and wait.

[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:36.200]
72 years I've been doing this business in this town.

[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:39.000]
I've never ever, if you know we've had our moments, you already know that.

[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:42.560]
But never ever encountered a time like this.

[01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:45.140]
Not for a day, not for an hour, not for a couple of days.

[01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:48.160]
For two solid weeks, getting worse and worse and worse.

[01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:52.980]
That nobody's got anything to say, because they're too busy out there buying their goddamn matthas or whatever they're doing.

[01:59:54.820 --> 02:00:00.160]
Getting their Easter eggs ready to stick in somebody's rectum, whatever they do with them.

[02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:06.980]
Max X down 33 cents.

[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:09.600]
The doubt is down 13.87.

[02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:10.980]
Everything is just down.

[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:12.140]
Sonny Hurst dies.

[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:13.080]
We're down about that.

[02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:16.980]
Audience is down in the depths of that we have no idea why, but they're down.

[02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:19.820]
They're suicidal.

[02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:21.020]
We're not really sure why.

[02:00:21.100 --> 02:00:21.720]
Maybe because they're here.

[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:22.600]
Maybe that's what it is.

[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:24.940]
Maybe because of that ball game on Sunday.

[02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:26.820]
Anybody mentioned the ball game?

[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:27.820]
Don't do it.

[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:29.160]
Not interested.

[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:31.700]
Wait for your breath on somebody else that cares about that.

[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:32.680]
Much you do about nothing.

[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:37.740]
You're going to let a bunch of binnavaled people dictate what your life is going to be all about.

[02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:39.180]
And what to you?

[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:40.040]
That's all I can tell you.

[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:42.360]
Here's Wilton Manners.

[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:42.580]
Hello.

[02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:43.980]
Hello, Neil.

[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:44.500]
Yes, sir.

[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:45.280]
How are you doing today?

[02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:45.840]
Great.

[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:47.940]
You know, you got to calm down a little bit.

[02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:49.060]
You're pretty upset today.

[02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:49.580]
No, I'm not.

[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:51.280]
I'm out of set at all.

[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:52.560]
I just would like to talk to somebody.

[02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:52.960]
That's all.

[02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:57.440]
Why do people say this when I start having to go through this song and a dance about getting people to call?

[02:00:57.440 --> 02:00:59.520]
Well, there's a lot of us that know a lot about hockey.

[02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:01.640]
You just think we don't, but we do.

[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:02.720]
So what am I going to hear it?

[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:04.060]
You heard it right now.

[02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:04.520]
Okay.

[02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:07.020]
I'd like to say go sabers, hopefully they can take it.

[02:01:07.020 --> 02:01:09.160]
What does that mean go sabers?

[02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:10.780]
Does that mean you know something about hockey?

[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:11.560]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:12.380 --> 02:01:13.060]
Go sabers.

[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:14.540]
Is that a hockey discussion?

[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:16.180]
Yeah.

[02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:16.860]
It is.

[02:01:17.420 --> 02:01:17.780]
Yeah.

[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:19.420]
I think there's a call off Rick Jenner right?

[02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:20.220]
Okay, get out of here.

[02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:21.180]
He'll hang up on it.

[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:23.920]
He'll snap the foam of the suspenders out of your hands.

[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:27.780]
Okay, so if you want to be able to say Buffalo wings, get out of here.

[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.260]
How do you like this?

[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:31.380]
That was perfect.

[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:32.520]
That's just what I'm talking about.

[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:33.720]
Well, there's a lot of us that know.

[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:36.460]
First of all, he's rooting for an out of town team just like I do for the least.

[02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:37.000]
That's okay.

[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:38.260]
But he's got nothing to say about.

[02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:40.520]
Go sabers is not a hockey discussion, sir.

[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:41.500]
It's not a comment.

[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:43.120]
It's not it's not provocative.

[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:43.920]
It's not interesting.

[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:44.780]
It's just stupid.

[02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:46.680]
Like the guy that calls and says go red wings.

[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:48.460]
Hi, I got one for you.

[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:49.000]
Go leaf.

[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:49.340]
Go.

[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:50.060]
How do you like that?

[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:52.580]
If we ever win another game, which I doubt.

[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:56.820]
There is a conversation list for you.

[02:01:57.500 --> 02:01:59.060]
I want to lay some hockey stuff on you.

[02:01:59.280 --> 02:01:59.880]
Go sabers.

[02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:01.380]
Yeah.

[02:02:02.020 --> 02:02:04.240]
But why don't they kick this ass out of cheek to waga, huh?

[02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:06.760]
They wouldn't let this loser back in Hamburg, New York.

[02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:09.800]
Even when the chickens in the cows running around there at Buffalo Raceway.

[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:11.020]
They wouldn't let this guy back.

[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:13.900]
I got news for you.

[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:15.400]
They wouldn't put your ass on the fan forum.

[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:16.460]
That's why you're calling this show.

[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:16.740]
Okay.

[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:17.740]
They wouldn't put you on here.

[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:21.200]
Absolutely unbelievable.

[02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:22.780]
The nature of the people in this town.

[02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:23.800]
And by the way, foul.

[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:26.920]
Buffalo blows and photo the bill.

[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:27.540]
How do you like that?

[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:30.960]
A nice goal by Matthew Barnaby for a Pittsburgh last night, sir.

[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:33.080]
I don't think he's playing for you guys anymore.

[02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:34.740]
Beautiful goal.

[02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:35.540]
Nice going there, Matt.

[02:02:36.180 --> 02:02:36.880]
Matt the rat.

[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:39.540]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:39.900]
Hello.

[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:41.020]
Who?

[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:41.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:43.860]
Yes, I don't want to kick it.

[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:44.960]
I don't want anything.

[02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:45.400]
Yeah.

[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:47.020]
I don't want to talk about sports.

[02:02:47.020 --> 02:02:48.780]
I just want to say everybody in Miami is dead.

[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:50.220]
Okay.

[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:51.200]
Thanks for the bulletin, sir.

[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:58.280]
The day Miami died.

[02:02:58.560 --> 02:02:59.020]
That's what we need.

[02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:00.440]
Book a brand to an American pie.

[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:02.100]
Take off, huh?

[02:03:03.060 --> 02:03:04.400]
Bye-bye to whatever.

[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:05.660]
You know, the day Miami died.

[02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:06.260]
Because it died.

[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:07.520]
This town died official.

[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:08.200]
It's official.

[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:10.160]
Just like when you're waiting after the race.

[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:10.520]
Okay.

[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:11.820]
It's official.

[02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:13.860]
The rigged red light went up on the tote board.

[02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:15.920]
Miami is dead.

[02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:18.060]
Right.

[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:21.220]
I thought it was us.

[02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:22.360]
I was starting to take it personal.

[02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:24.340]
Hank was starting to take it personal.

[02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:25.820]
The worst team.

[02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:26.760]
They should take it personal.

[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:28.100]
Now they're going to their finished anyway.

[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:31.660]
1256 at 560 WM.

[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:33.980]
And when you sent and listened to this, the one after another.

[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:35.320]
Hey, I got something to talk about.

[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:36.280]
You think we don't know nothing?

[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:36.660]
Yeah.

[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:36.960]
Okay.

[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:37.620]
Well, tell me something.

[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:38.440]
Go savers.

[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:42.640]
You know something.

[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:44.340]
I am so goddamn impressed.

[02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:44.800]
Okay.

[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:45.080]
Okay.

[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:47.720]
If I had to vote, I'd be able to describe you.

[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:52.740]
I just don't have the kind of vocabulary to totally and fully and thoroughly express the astonishment

[02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:57.880]
and amazement that I feel with your perspickacity and the ability to really verbalize and vocalize

[02:03:57.880 --> 02:03:59.560]
your stupidity.

[02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:00.600]
Go savers.

[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:01.280]
Hahaha.

[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:04.820]
Anybody ever been to Buffalo, by the way?

[02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:07.260]
Seeing the kind of people that are in Buffalo.

[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:09.540]
And they do have that good show on fan TV on Empire.

[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:10.180]
I will say that.

[02:04:10.180 --> 02:04:12.580]
They get a lot better sports calls than the station does.

[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:14.980]
But they're all from out of town.

[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:23.100]
I guess they're from like Lee Roy and Vittavia, O'Neillana, Cannon DeGro, Geneva, Penaan, Glenn's

[02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:24.640]
Falls, Honey Roy Falls.

[02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:26.220]
Right?

[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:27.740]
You're on the quite.

[02:04:28.620 --> 02:04:30.320]
It's not just the one to two hour.

[02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:31.640]
It's a phenomenon.

[02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:37.620]
Oh, yeah.

[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:38.820]
You win, Brad Boys.

[02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:41.780]
Never made a door.

[02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:49.120]
You make the all you never saw because they're each other's paw and they're forking their

[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:49.460]
paws.

[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:53.120]
Russian, they're gums.

[02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:56.260]
Because they ain't got no teeth.

[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:02.740]
Most days are mountain there, Mama, because they can't get to see.

[02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:04.100]
Oh, I see.

[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:06.140]
They're in the way.

[02:05:07.660 --> 02:05:09.320]
They don't know how.

[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:16.200]
That's just a little more bonding going, tipping from cows.

[02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:19.560]
Just to be Brad Boys.

[02:05:21.100 --> 02:05:22.700]
Wouldn't change if they could.

[02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:29.400]
It's ruined with Darwin because there came folkism wood.

[02:05:34.100 --> 02:05:36.460]
Okay, it's 102 at 550 WQM.

[02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:40.140]
Our poll question today is who's the bigger asshole, Pete Bozer or Pete Bozer?

[02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:41.220]
That's our poll question.

[02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:42.160]
Huh?

[02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:44.880]
Well, no, it's one from Colomé and one from Colomé.

[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:46.580]
It's a multiple choice with only one choice.

[02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:47.700]
Who is the biggest asshole?

[02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:48.220]
Love them all.

[02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:50.200]
In fact, that's a good thing.

[02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:50.900]
I forgot that.

[02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:52.960]
God, that would have been perfect today.

[02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:53.460]
Here we go.

[02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:55.000]
A little dedication for it.

[02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:56.260]
I'm five, six, eight.

[02:05:56.760 --> 02:06:02.080]
I want to tell you a story about the brand new world's biggest asshole.

[02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:03.140]
Yes.

[02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:10.400]
It's a brand new story about the brand new world's biggest asshole.

[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:11.160]
Yes.

[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:18.280]
His name is Pete Bozer and he's a new world's biggest asshole.

[02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:21.700]
Oh, yeah.

[02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:27.600]
Three minutes after one at five, 60 WQM, the Hank Goldberg show from Tampa, side of the final four, baby.

[02:06:28.700 --> 02:06:29.820]
Hank will be on two to six.

[02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:32.160]
Then we got to briefly, we got Donnie Beon from 67.

[02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:33.060]
Are you ready for that?

[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:33.260]
No.

[02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:35.200]
Donnie Beon, while you're ready, not Hill Beon.

[02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:37.260]
And then we be at the Macaroon.

[02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:38.580]
I don't know if I'm going to that game or not.

[02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:39.360]
Anybody wants those tickets?

[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:40.180]
John's not going.

[02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:41.540]
He's giving up.

[02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:42.640]
He just can't stand it anymore.

[02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:43.380]
I don't know.

[02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:44.200]
I'll probably go.

[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:45.580]
No, see one thing.

[02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:46.540]
You're laughing.

[02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:47.480]
I won't eat.

[02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:49.460]
All I have is a diet soda.

[02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:50.140]
That's all I have.

[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:53.020]
That's like three hours or four hours because I get there early.

[02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:57.160]
Four hours of not eating because I'm not going to eat any wings over price crap anyway.

[02:06:57.820 --> 02:07:01.180]
So that's good because I've been on such great behavior virtually all week.

[02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:05.140]
Except for the guy that sent me the smarties with my airplane tickets and don't ever do that again, please.

[02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:07.100]
Why do people do that?

[02:07:08.060 --> 02:07:08.700]
Look at Sonny.

[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:09.360]
He's dead.

[02:07:10.180 --> 02:07:11.640]
Probably one meal too many.

[02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:13.320]
You know, somebody did in his sorrow.

[02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:16.260]
Oh, there was a screw in his life over somebody fed him one meal too many.

[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:16.920]
That was it.

[02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:19.640]
That's what I'll put on my tombstone.

[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:22.180]
One box of smarties too many put him over the edge.

[02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:26.540]
One Ben and Jerry's, you know, one fish food pint over the edge.

[02:07:27.580 --> 02:07:28.440]
Stop doing it.

[02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:30.260]
Fat is a killer.

[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:31.040]
It's ugly.

[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:31.540]
It's gross.

[02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:32.420]
And it makes you sick.

[02:07:32.540 --> 02:07:33.220]
And it makes you die.

[02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:34.160]
How do you like that?

[02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:36.160]
So I'm going to say it right now.

[02:07:36.420 --> 02:07:38.840]
Anybody who sends me fattening stuff is an asshole.

[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:41.300]
Not as big as P. Poole's here, but you're in the running.

[02:07:41.300 --> 02:07:42.060]
You're bubbling under.

[02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:42.400]
Okay.

[02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:44.460]
Cut it out.

[02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:46.880]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:47.140]
Hello.

[02:07:47.780 --> 02:07:48.440]
Yes, sir.

[02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:49.200]
Yeah.

[02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:51.240]
How do I have you finally?

[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:51.860]
You have me.

[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:52.680]
Okay.

[02:07:53.140 --> 02:07:54.320]
Neil, I don't know what it means.

[02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:55.280]
What does that mean finally?

[02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:56.020]
What is that?

[02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:57.080]
Well, they're waiting for it well.

[02:07:57.320 --> 02:07:57.480]
Yeah.

[02:07:57.940 --> 02:08:01.320]
I just, I understand you're one of the smart guys who own a Corvette.

[02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:02.260]
Two.

[02:08:02.860 --> 02:08:03.300]
Two.

[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:04.700]
I own two also.

[02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:05.340]
I have 29.

[02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:10.640]
So I want to invite you to the Corvette Platinum Show at William's Island.

[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:11.300]
They second.

[02:08:11.540 --> 02:08:11.740]
No.

[02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:12.140]
Okay.

[02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:13.620]
200 Corvette.

[02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:14.280]
No.

[02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:14.640]
Okay.

[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:17.180]
So I just wanted to tell you about that.

[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:17.840]
Okay, thanks.

[02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:18.820]
Okay.

[02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:19.280]
Okay.

[02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:19.620]
No.

[02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:20.420]
I'll be there.

[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:22.220]
Open line indeed.

[02:08:22.980 --> 02:08:24.320]
56705, 60 in somewhere.

[02:08:24.500 --> 02:08:25.520]
I don't know where these lines are coming in.

[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:26.840]
I don't even know if they're coming in at all.

[02:08:27.260 --> 02:08:28.180]
I don't know if they're coming in at all.

[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:29.880]
Are they coming in to fix your just phone in there?

[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:30.160]
No.

[02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:35.500]
See, you guys around here, you can walk around and laugh and titter and think this is all great material.

[02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:36.580]
And you guys are very funny.

[02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:38.000]
And this is just sticking to that.

[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.320]
You guys are an embarrassment.

[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:40.600]
Bluff Lindsey, Greg Reid.

[02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:42.400]
You know, you can, all we hear from Greg Reid.

[02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:43.340]
Nothing about the business.

[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:44.300]
Not this business.

[02:08:44.420 --> 02:08:45.500]
We are about the outside business.

[02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:47.380]
But nothing about doing business in this place.

[02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:51.500]
The worst guy I've ever worked for as far as being able to talk about what's going on here.

[02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:55.740]
He's got something to say about everybody else, every other station, every other sports franchise.

[02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:56.460]
You name it.

[02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:58.980]
But when it comes to dealing with what's going on here, can he do it?

[02:08:59.020 --> 02:08:59.360]
No.

[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:00.600]
Because he doesn't know about it.

[02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:01.380]
You don't get it.

[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:03.740]
Got a guy sitting in the other room.

[02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:05.300]
We got business to take care of here.

[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:05.600]
Okay.

[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:07.200]
A phone.

[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:09.160]
He can't have no contact with the outside world.

[02:09:10.460 --> 02:09:12.720]
I say, I say Monday if they don't get the phone picks.

[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:14.460]
We're going back down on the second floor.

[02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:16.140]
Even without the board, without a microphone.

[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:17.920]
We'll just stay down on the second floor.

[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:18.380]
10 to 2.

[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:18.760]
That's all.

[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:19.800]
And I'll talk about it.

[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:20.700]
We'll open up the window.

[02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:23.880]
As much responses were getting lately up here.

[02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:25.780]
Mobile Infrared Myers.

[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:26.080]
Hello.

[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:27.200]
Hi Neil.

[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:27.640]
How you doing?

[02:09:27.740 --> 02:09:28.160]
Okay, sir.

[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:33.000]
Maybe for a slow day, I have a couple of pieces of material worth a minute.

[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:35.080]
One is just an observation.

[02:09:35.380 --> 02:09:41.580]
And that is, it seems to me that the absolute worst callers that you get are when somebody calls,

[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:44.200]
they don't really have something that they care to talk about.

[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:44.460]
Yeah.

[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:47.800]
They think they have found something that you will agree with.

[02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:50.080]
And they think they have found the way to get you the suckles.

[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:50.520]
Yeah, suckles, right.

[02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:52.880]
And they can, uh, Neil will approve.

[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:54.720]
Neil will like you if I call and say this.

[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:55.100]
Right.

[02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:56.580]
So I get some damnent of the calls.

[02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:57.100]
I hate it.

[02:09:57.480 --> 02:09:58.100]
It's the worst.

[02:09:58.260 --> 02:09:58.800]
And it's boring.

[02:09:58.800 --> 02:09:59.820]
I love the ones that I'll say.

[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:00.740]
Why don't you agree?

[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:02.000]
Don't you think, you know, I don't know.

[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:02.240]
You're great.

[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:02.940]
Maybe not.

[02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:03.380]
I don't know.

[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:04.340]
Perfect example.

[02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:04.740]

[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:09.500]
And so if that's why they're calling the callers, the most people call talk shows, the suck

[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:09.820]
around.

[02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:13.740]
And for somebody to validate them in their stupid opinions, that's why most people call talk

[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:13.860]
shows.

[02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:16.700]
That's why I have to work so hard and I've been doing it for 23 years.

[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.740]
It was sifting through eight zillion calls to get to somebody who's got something to say

[02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:23.620]
whether it's interesting, amusing, hysterical, anything.

[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:25.420]
That's something original to say.

[02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:28.080]
Other than just, uh, don't you think I'm okay, pat me on the head.

[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:32.140]
So that's why you're calling, give us all a break and just let me know, play us a bit or something like that.

[02:10:32.140 --> 02:10:33.180]
Play us a lot of music, right?

[02:10:33.420 --> 02:10:33.740]
There you go.

[02:10:33.900 --> 02:10:34.220]
Yes.

[02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:40.840]
Another thing I wanted to bring up is, I've heard you talk a lot about your philosophy of

[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:41.380]
do no harm.

[02:10:41.580 --> 02:10:41.740]
Yes.

[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:46.420]
And I actually have flaw on there and I wonder what your response is.

[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:51.440]
And that is, it doesn't obligate anyone to act in a positive way.

[02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:53.880]
It simply says don't act in a negative way.

[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:54.100]
Right.

[02:10:54.100 --> 02:11:00.440]
So for example, I don't remember the year, but years ago this girl, I think her name was

[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:06.900]
Kitty GenoVC, was murdered in New York and something like 120 people listened to her scream for 30 minutes.

[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:12.100]
I lost her being repeatedly stabbed and no one even picked up the phone to call the cops.

[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:18.400]
I don't even think there's a moral obligation to act in a situation like that.

[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:20.460]
There is no moral obligation to do anything.

[02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:24.360]
I mean, if people want to do something like I said do no harm and if you want to do some good at the same time,

[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:24.820]
that's fine.

[02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:25.720]
Don't do any harm.

[02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:26.320]
No, there's not.

[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:32.780]
Well, you don't feel like if you saw someone being murdered and you're not going to put yourself at risk.

[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:32.940]
Right.

[02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:35.660]
I just have to pick up the telephone.

[02:11:36.020 --> 02:11:38.060]
You don't feel there's some, you have a moral obligation.

[02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:39.420]
What does that have to do with religion?

[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:41.120]
What does that have to do with philosophy of life?

[02:11:41.580 --> 02:11:43.560]
Well, I didn't say it's a religious question for me.

[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:44.960]
DNA is what we're doing.

[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:45.880]
It has to do with religion.

[02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:47.300]
It has to do with a philosophy of life.

[02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:51.380]
Not with these hypothetical things that probably are never going to happen in our lifetime.

[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:55.920]
All right. Well, I wouldn't hit you that my belief that you have a moral imperative.

[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:57.080]
I'm like people who are coming in here right now.

[02:11:57.260 --> 02:11:58.580]
I'm probably never going to see anybody murder.

[02:11:58.980 --> 02:11:59.460]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:00.220]
Okay.

[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:01.740]
That's probably true.

[02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:01.940]

[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:10.000]
I will admit to you that my belief that you do have a moral imperative to act does come from a religious tradition.

[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:11.500]
But I'm not posing it religiously.

[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:13.160]
I'm not saying that God commands us.

[02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:15.440]
I said if you want to do something good, that's fine.

[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:17.260]
But if you don't, so be it.

[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:20.820]
All right. Well, I...

[02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:21.360]
That's my man.

[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:25.160]
You know, if you were talking about the other callers, I'm telling you the way I feel.

[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:28.380]
I mean, if you want me to say something you'll agree with, I'll say it, but I don't believe it.

[02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:29.140]
Not at all.

[02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:29.640]
Not at all.

[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:30.340]
I believe.

[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:31.880]
I'm calling to hear what you believe.

[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:32.560]
I believe.

[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:35.580]
I'm surprised, but I'll accept that as your opinion.

[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:36.060]
Okay.

[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:36.780]
All right.

[02:12:37.260 --> 02:12:38.400]
Have a good day.

[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:40.360]
Open line in the summer.

[02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:43.980]
56670560.560 on the mobile one line.

[02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:48.380]
I mean, if we have to choose between that or all the other stuff that people are doing and

[02:12:48.380 --> 02:12:52.900]
and flipping on each other in the name of their religions, I think mine be small by a million miles.

[02:12:53.060 --> 02:12:55.380]
I could be wrong about that, but I don't think so.

[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:56.360]
See ya'll, sir.

[02:12:57.160 --> 02:12:58.420]
Play off this.

[02:12:59.160 --> 02:12:59.440]
Ow!

[02:12:59.940 --> 02:13:02.900]
No. There's a video just for adults.

[02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:05.800]
Cherry Springer says I've got to get these guys on my show.

[02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:12.660]
See how one big fat captain wearing an ugly blue suit gets down the pants of Mr. Green's team.

[02:13:12.660 --> 02:13:15.500]
And wait till you see what he does with dancing there.

[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:18.860]
Grandfather clock can't keep his hands off of Mr. Moose.

[02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:21.840]
And watch Bunny Ratted get himself a little cotton tail.

[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:26.860]
And when the balls fall on these guys' faces, they love it.

[02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:28.940]
Captain Kangus grew.

[02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:31.280]
Now on video through the Homo Shopping Network.

[02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:32.720]
Captain Kangus grew.

[02:13:33.740 --> 02:13:34.800]
Now on video.

[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:35.500]
Yeah!

[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:38.940]
Okay, 114.560WQAM.

[02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:41.340]
We got Panthers hockey tonight.

[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:42.860]
Panthers in Nashville, the Predators.

[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:44.340]
Pretty damn good expansion team.

[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:46.000]
Anybody interested?

[02:13:46.180 --> 02:13:46.340]
No.

[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:46.680]
Okay.

[02:13:47.180 --> 02:13:49.040]
Anybody pissed off Pavel Berean playing?

[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:49.220]
No.

[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:51.160]
And he's gonna come back whatever he seems to feel like it.

[02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:51.400]
No.

[02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:52.600]
Even though we didn't, they don't care.

[02:13:52.900 --> 02:13:53.220]
That's good.

[02:13:53.460 --> 02:13:54.340]
See one thing that's good.

[02:13:54.620 --> 02:13:56.740]
For the TM and BM and all you other guys.

[02:13:56.980 --> 02:13:59.200]
All the guys on the team robbing all you other slackers.

[02:13:59.280 --> 02:13:59.900]
They don't care.

[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:01.460]
So that's comforting to know.

[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:02.140]
They don't give a crap.

[02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:06.900]
Unlike sometimes, you know, like Montreal, Philly, where they boo the crap out of you.

[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:07.640]
They're merciful.

[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:08.780]
Here, we don't care.

[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:10.100]
We're just out there to smooths anyway.

[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:11.660]
If you win the game, hey, we'll cheer.

[02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:13.640]
Here's a mobile in Boca.

[02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:13.920]
Hello.

[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:14.840]
Neil.

[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:15.380]
Yes, sir.

[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:16.660]
I got up, Alex.

[02:14:17.420 --> 02:14:19.060]
I've been listening for years and I have alcohol.

[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:19.620]
Yes.

[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:21.300]
I hope I can make it up to you.

[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:21.720]
Okay.

[02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:25.140]
Yesterday when you played the Martin song at the end of your show.

[02:14:25.340 --> 02:14:25.500]
Yeah.

[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:29.140]
I was in front of John Henners, so I turned it up.

[02:14:30.060 --> 02:14:30.640]
Really now.

[02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:31.160]
Yeah.

[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:32.400]
For you, man.

[02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:33.340]
Uh-huh.

[02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:35.420]
That's good.

[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:35.940]
Okay.

[02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:37.360]
Well, nice try, sir.

[02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:37.820]
Keep trying.

[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:41.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:47.120]
So let me ask you, what do you think about the intellectual level here in town?

[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:51.600]
What do you think about the social, the strat of, huh?

[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:58.860]
I'm going to tell you, if you took golf out of this area, you have to say, just forget about tennis, forget about scuba diving, forget about the putt pulling.

[02:14:59.140 --> 02:15:04.060]
If you took golf out of this repertoire down here, it would be a golf gone.

[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:04.900]
I'll be gone.

[02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:06.820]
You follow what I'm saying?

[02:15:07.460 --> 02:15:09.640]
In other words, that's the, that's the epitome.

[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:11.860]
That's the level to which most of these people strive.

[02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:13.040]
The golf course.

[02:15:13.260 --> 02:15:13.640]
That's it.

[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:16.600]
Golf courses, name dropping.

[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:17.660]
That's, that's about it.

[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:20.380]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:20.680]
Hello.

[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:22.360]
Yes, good day, Neil.

[02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:23.120]
Yes, man, good day.

[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:25.400]
Um, um, why I'm calling.

[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:27.580]
Um, Miami, it's a pits.

[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:29.160]
But you haven't seen anything yet.

[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:34.520]
I don't know if you're familiar with the, um, mental facility Douglas Gardens on Lincoln Road.

[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:37.400]
It's services, uh, quite a few of the homeless.

[02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:38.680]
It's a large facility.

[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:44.500]
Well, they, they've got back on the resources and the homeless have to pay for the medication.

[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:49.500]
So that means we're going to have a lot of insane hulios and otherwise out on the streets.

[02:15:49.820 --> 02:15:50.240]
Uh-huh.

[02:15:50.420 --> 02:15:51.540]
Don't we already have that?

[02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:53.760]
Yeah, but it's going to be W or flat.

[02:15:54.460 --> 02:15:54.640]
Yeah.

[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:55.580]
Did you imagine?

[02:15:56.100 --> 02:16:00.220]
But, uh, I'm so glad that you're, um, seeing the light and taking care of your health.

[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:01.360]
And we'll have the eye.

[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:03.380]
I enjoy your show and have a good day.

[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:04.240]
Good day.

[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:05.000]
Yeah.

[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:11.300]
What do you give me?

[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:13.360]
I looked like that she was talking about mental health, okay?

[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:15.920]
She was talking about mental health.

[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.520]
I think it kind of fit right in with her call.

[02:16:17.660 --> 02:16:18.840]
How dare you!

[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:20.600]
Here is a lake worth.

[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:20.840]
Hello.

[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:21.560]
Hey.

[02:16:21.860 --> 02:16:22.180]
Yes, sir.

[02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:22.760]
How are you, sir?

[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:23.420]
Pretty good.

[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:24.900]
Sorry to hear about Sonny.

[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:25.640]
Yeah.

[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:28.860]
He was like one of the few regular, just real nice guys.

[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:30.080]
A regular guy, that's right.

[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:30.380]
He was.

[02:16:30.740 --> 02:16:35.320]
He wasn't one of these pretentious, phony, backstabbing assholes who predominate the business in this

[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:36.320]
town in this market.

[02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:40.240]
Especially in the ones that do games, you know, broadcast games.

[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:40.560]
Right.

[02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:40.920]
Boy.

[02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:43.300]
Hey, I wanted to feed you any of your...

[02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:46.160]
I brought up the, uh, restroom thing, women's restrooms again.

[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:46.480]

[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:47.060]
To help you out there.

[02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:48.480]
Right.

[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:48.920]
Okay.

[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:52.800]
I worked for, when I went back to school a couple of years ago, I worked for a cleaning company at night.

[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:56.360]
And I, within many different women's bathrooms and offices and things.

[02:16:57.180 --> 02:17:01.460]
And as far as graffiti, it kind of like depends on what the place is.

[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:06.180]
You're certainly not going to find graffiti in like a nice restaurant or a hotel or a country club, something like that.

[02:17:06.300 --> 02:17:09.820]
But if you go to like just a regular bar or something, there's plenty of graffiti in there.

[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:11.000]
Nasty, dirty stuff.

[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:11.460]
Really?

[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:15.980]
But the real thing is women are pig.

[02:17:15.980 --> 02:17:19.960]
If anybody, you know, we all pretend like the males were pigs were dirty.

[02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:26.480]
I can't tell you what they don't hit the bowl with and just let down on the floor and don't care.

[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:28.060]
Oh, man.

[02:17:28.580 --> 02:17:29.680]
Oh, yeah.

[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:31.260]
Unbelievable.

[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:31.920]
Great.

[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:32.740]
It's really bad.

[02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:33.960]
Makes me feel better, I'll tell you.

[02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:34.680]
It's really nice.

[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:35.960]
Makes me feel almost like a real man.

[02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:43.320]
And my last thing, if, you know, you know, you're the only thing on the radio we're listening to.

[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:47.260]
And after two o'clock, we're all desperate now and Rick and Suss aren't there anymore.

[02:17:47.540 --> 02:17:50.320]
Well, let me ask you if I'm the only thing on the radio worth listening to.

[02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:51.320]
Where's the audience gone?

[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:54.900]
It's here to last two weeks since we moved in these marginal studios up here where it's too warm.

[02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:56.240]
By the way, I know I'm the third floor.

[02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:57.660]
Where's everybody gone, sir?

[02:17:57.800 --> 02:17:59.180]
I had to press the radio station.

[02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:02.460]
It's like somebody sucked this station into a vacuum tube and we're out there looking.

[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:05.740]
I mean, I feel like the shrinking invisible man is what I feel like.

[02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:06.560]
I don't know how they lied.

[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:10.080]
You got work in today, but I was pressing readout for 20 minutes and just getting a busy signal.

[02:18:10.260 --> 02:18:11.600]
Oh, this thing, who knows?

[02:18:11.940 --> 02:18:12.600]
I have no idea.

[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:18.300]
Listen, if you think that Rick Riley is talking about stocks, is stimulating radio.

[02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:19.220]
No, I don't.

[02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:23.960]
Wait until you try four hours or three hours of Randy Rhodes has given us political commentary.

[02:18:24.780 --> 02:18:25.160]
I'll pass.

[02:18:25.380 --> 02:18:25.920]
I'll pass them.

[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:26.620]
Love you, ma'am.

[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:27.320]
Okay, see you.

[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:31.600]
56670560, 0560 on a mobile one line.

[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:32.340]
No waiting.

[02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:33.200]
You'll get right in.

[02:18:33.260 --> 02:18:34.120]
Immediately with nuts in it.

[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:37.740]
We'll put you on hold for a little while because then we don't want you to feel like Mr. Bigshot.

[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:42.140]
Seriously, I have encountered all of it.

[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:43.920]
That's why it never is boring.

[02:18:44.100 --> 02:18:44.640]
It's never dull.

[02:18:44.780 --> 02:18:48.860]
It's frustrating, but it's never dull because no matter what you think you've experienced before,

[02:18:49.140 --> 02:18:52.820]
you come in here, you sit your fan-ass in the chair and no matter what you feel is going on,

[02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:53.800]
surprise.

[02:18:54.300 --> 02:18:56.100]
Like having a surprise party every day or life.

[02:18:57.180 --> 02:18:57.860]
Guess what?

[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:02.980]
And like I said, this year it's going to be paysof and Easter and then it'll be the 4th of July.

[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:04.980]
And then before we know it, it'll be Labor Day.

[02:19:04.980 --> 02:19:08.140]
And of course in between the long, hot summer, kids around the school,

[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:09.000]
everybody's not vacation.

[02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:12.760]
I think from like April 1st until Labor Day.

[02:19:13.380 --> 02:19:15.480]
That would be a nice week for vacation for me, you know what?

[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:17.700]
April 1st, no fooling.

[02:19:17.980 --> 02:19:18.660]
Right to Labor Day.

[02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:20.880]
That's April, May, June, July, August.

[02:19:21.060 --> 02:19:22.280]
A little bit of the first week in September.

[02:19:22.580 --> 02:19:23.760]
That's only a little over four months.

[02:19:24.660 --> 02:19:26.760]
That sounds like a great time for me to go on vacation.

[02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:28.560]
Huh?

[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:30.360]
Stop the seven months I was off before.

[02:19:32.340 --> 02:19:34.900]
I mean, why should I be bothering these people with bugging them,

[02:19:34.940 --> 02:19:36.120]
expecting them to talk to me?

[02:19:36.220 --> 02:19:36.240]
Huh?

[02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:37.360]
It's impionant.

[02:19:38.140 --> 02:19:38.640]
It's insolent.

[02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:39.180]
It's outrageous.

[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:39.940]
It's unacceptable.

[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:41.700]
Entertain us.

[02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:42.000]
Come on.

[02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:43.300]
We want you to entertain us.

[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:46.080]
Do a little dance like those bitches that came to borders that day.

[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:50.280]
Those two slots from Detroit couldn't get laid in a pickle packs.

[02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:51.360]
Those two broads.

[02:19:52.180 --> 02:19:52.540]
God.

[02:19:53.220 --> 02:19:54.360]
Oh, you enjoyed yourself boring.

[02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:57.340]
You know, we expected something a little bit more.

[02:19:58.500 --> 02:20:02.120]
Yeah, how about our foot up your, up your rectum, huh?

[02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:03.940]
Here's a mobile invoker.

[02:20:03.940 --> 02:20:04.240]
Hello?

[02:20:06.100 --> 02:20:06.900]
Mobile invoker.

[02:20:06.900 --> 02:20:07.380]
Yes, sir.

[02:20:07.780 --> 02:20:07.920]
Hello.

[02:20:08.100 --> 02:20:08.260]
Hey.

[02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:11.680]
I was, I'm calling a mega request.

[02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:13.100]
Is that all right?

[02:20:13.420 --> 02:20:13.720]
Maybe.

[02:20:14.140 --> 02:20:14.460]
Yeah.

[02:20:15.060 --> 02:20:16.620]
Oh, could you play, Bernie takes a dump?

[02:20:16.740 --> 02:20:16.920]
No.

[02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:21.520]
56670560 and pound 560 on a mobile one line.

[02:20:22.340 --> 02:20:24.340]
It's interesting when we're doing the thing about fat occupations.

[02:20:24.900 --> 02:20:26.320]
It was like doing biorethms.

[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:27.440]
We never had to give the number out.

[02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:32.540]
See, when you do something that's like a poll or like, you know, it requires like a one word answer.

[02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:33.420]
No problem.

[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:36.540]
Because otherwise you're testing their material which they don't have a lot.

[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:38.420]
But something like that limitless.

[02:20:39.340 --> 02:20:40.720]
We could have done that for 100 days.

[02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:41.520]
So what else you got?

[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:44.980]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:45.220]
Hello?

[02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:48.380]
Mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:50.900]
Okay.

[02:20:51.580 --> 02:20:53.420]
Here's Fort Lauderdale on a not so mobile.

[02:20:53.540 --> 02:20:53.700]
Hello.

[02:20:53.700 --> 02:20:54.640]
Yes, sir.

[02:20:54.780 --> 02:20:55.560]
You got me?

[02:20:55.800 --> 02:20:56.220]
I got you.

[02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:58.660]
Well, I tell you, I wanted somebody to talk to you.

[02:20:58.780 --> 02:20:59.700]
You got the real deal.

[02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:00.020]
Yeah.

[02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:02.600]
Because I want to tell you what impressed me about you.

[02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:02.940]
Yeah.

[02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:08.600]
What impressed me is when you mentioned that hydrochloricide about a doctor that suggested that you take

[02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:10.260]
it every day like 50 milligrams.

[02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:10.540]
Yes.

[02:21:10.840 --> 02:21:14.720]
And the same thing happened to me and I would have wound up in a dialysis machine.

[02:21:14.920 --> 02:21:15.260]
That's right.

[02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:16.580]
If I ever listened to this, that's right.

[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:16.720]

[02:21:16.980 --> 02:21:18.600]
Now, I want to tell you something else.

[02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:21.000]
You impressed me about a number of things.

[02:21:21.140 --> 02:21:21.420]
I'm glad.

[02:21:21.460 --> 02:21:22.620]
What I wanted to call you.

[02:21:22.620 --> 02:21:24.180]
I obviously don't impress anybody else.

[02:21:24.180 --> 02:21:24.580]
Wait a minute.

[02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:27.440]
I mean, that's what I needed from you most of all.

[02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:27.720]
Yes.

[02:21:27.820 --> 02:21:28.500]
Of course, I called.

[02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:29.720]
I never got a call back.

[02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:31.900]
Because I needed a nose and throat guy.

[02:21:32.180 --> 02:21:34.400]
Because my voice is very important.

[02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:36.220]
What do you mean you've never got a call back?

[02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:37.340]
I called you.

[02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:37.520]

[02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:39.560]
And I needed that calls you after the show.

[02:21:39.620 --> 02:21:41.680]
And I left my name, which will not be mentioned.

[02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:42.800]
I'm going to mention my name.

[02:21:42.860 --> 02:21:44.540]
Well, I'm going to recommend doctors.

[02:21:44.780 --> 02:21:44.920]
You're on the doctor.

[02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:47.500]
Well, I thought maybe you knew a nose and throat guy.

[02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:48.480]
No, I don't.

[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:49.080]
You don't.

[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:50.460]
You have no problem with your throat?

[02:21:50.660 --> 02:21:50.800]
No.

[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:51.680]
You're on the efforts.

[02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:53.920]
Four hours is just talking away.

[02:21:53.980 --> 02:21:55.580]
My voice goes in an hour and a half.

[02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:56.160]
Let me sit again.

[02:21:56.320 --> 02:21:57.720]
I have no problem with my throat.

[02:21:57.800 --> 02:21:58.160]
None.

[02:21:58.580 --> 02:21:59.780]
You have no problems.

[02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:01.700]
Let me say one more time for the West Coast.

[02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:03.940]
I have no problem with my throat.

[02:22:03.940 --> 02:22:03.940]

[02:22:03.940 --> 02:22:05.660]
I can't throw up for more than an hour and a half.

[02:22:05.660 --> 02:22:07.820]
Well, you better let me let you off the phone then.

[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:09.400]
I don't want to stress it out.

[02:22:11.940 --> 02:22:14.180]
5670560, pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[02:22:14.340 --> 02:22:14.620]
Wow.

[02:22:15.140 --> 02:22:17.180]
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

[02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:19.700]
Mobile and pepper pine.

[02:22:19.700 --> 02:22:20.020]
Hello.

[02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:20.760]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:21.320]
I don't know.

[02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:22.480]
I know what that guy's problem is.

[02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:22.660]
Yeah.

[02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:23.720]
You've got to do it too much.

[02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:25.140]
That's why it's growth certain.

[02:22:25.180 --> 02:22:25.960]
You can't talk too much.

[02:22:26.260 --> 02:22:29.460]
I got an interesting video news for you last night.

[02:22:30.300 --> 02:22:33.580]
Last night it was, I know you don't like soccer and everything like that, but I was at the Macarena.

[02:22:33.940 --> 02:22:34.980]
Did I soccer game last night?

[02:22:35.260 --> 02:22:36.820]
There was a soccer game in the Macarena.

[02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:38.120]
Well, you're the indoor soccer league.

[02:22:38.740 --> 02:22:39.640]
You probably only...

[02:22:39.640 --> 02:22:39.800]
Yeah.

[02:22:39.980 --> 02:22:45.020]
Well, anyway, you're not going to believe there was a local sportscaster from Channel 10 news

[02:22:45.020 --> 02:22:48.140]
that made an appearance in Goal and a professional game last night.

[02:22:48.980 --> 02:22:50.840]
And guess on who that might be from Channel 10?

[02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:51.740]
He did what?

[02:22:52.100 --> 02:22:54.960]
He played Goalkeeper last night, an indoor soccer team.

[02:22:55.120 --> 02:22:55.340]
Don?

[02:22:55.580 --> 02:22:55.780]
No.

[02:22:56.120 --> 02:22:56.280]
No.

[02:22:56.500 --> 02:22:57.120]
Todd Tungan.

[02:22:57.560 --> 02:22:58.840]
You're Frank Fort.

[02:22:59.340 --> 02:22:59.580]
Yeah.

[02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:00.520]
What a joke.

[02:23:01.500 --> 02:23:03.280]
He only made a 50% phase.

[02:23:03.340 --> 02:23:06.620]
I'm like, you know, why don't we just put a Hank Goalkeeper for the Panthers tonight?

[02:23:06.900 --> 02:23:07.140]
How about Booshambi?

[02:23:08.020 --> 02:23:09.660]
Well, you know, we'll have a cover both sides.

[02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:10.520]
You can put all three in.

[02:23:10.700 --> 02:23:11.580]
Go the whole gang down in.

[02:23:11.940 --> 02:23:12.660]
Okay, thank you.

[02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:15.540]
560, 7.0560, pound 560.

[02:23:15.980 --> 02:23:17.800]
I don't believe it.

[02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:18.200]
I'm going to have a look at the

[02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:18.780]
one on the mobile one line.

[02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:22.020]
Here's Cutler Ridge.

[02:23:22.180 --> 02:23:22.260]
Hello.

[02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:24.840]
Cutler Ridge.

[02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:26.160]
Oh, boy, that was loud.

[02:23:26.900 --> 02:23:27.620]
Yeah, hey, Neil.

[02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:29.040]
Here's Cutler Ridge.

[02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:32.220]
No, it loud deep before you got me.

[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:33.480]
Well, I see I'd either wake you up.

[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:33.960]
There you go.

[02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:35.360]
Not the new people need to be awakened.

[02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:38.960]
I was going through an old briefcase here and I found this one hell of a long list.

[02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:40.480]
And it's dated 1988.

[02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:44.900]
And it starts out with a bunch of names that you may or may not remember from Wins.

[02:23:45.340 --> 02:23:50.760]
Bill Byer, Peter Bulger, David Capreda, all these people.

[02:23:50.940 --> 02:23:55.320]
And you're on there and everybody's on there all the way down to Ron Harrison and Glenn

[02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:55.660]
Hill.

[02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:59.100]
All their titles from WNC.

[02:23:59.360 --> 02:23:59.560]
Yeah.

[02:23:59.800 --> 02:24:00.940]
And there's another sheet over here.

[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:01.680]
And what about it?

[02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:03.400]
Well, I just thought of another sheet of what?

[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:04.420]
What is the sheet about?

[02:24:04.660 --> 02:24:06.400]
It sounds like a policy to me.

[02:24:06.540 --> 02:24:08.680]
This says your home phone number back in 88.

[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:09.620]
You remember it?

[02:24:10.900 --> 02:24:12.980]
Oh, well, if I did, am I going to put it on the ear?

[02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:13.900]
What are we talking about?

[02:24:13.900 --> 02:24:15.220]
Oh, I just thought it was interesting.

[02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:16.760]
I'm going through some old records here.

[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:17.860]
And records of what?

[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:19.760]
WNC, I was on there for a while.

[02:24:19.960 --> 02:24:24.680]
I remember walking down to the very front of the Placino past the atrium and looking through

[02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:26.440]
your little door and watching you in the bird.

[02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:29.780]
And I never had the guts to go in there and say, thank God, that's good.

[02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:32.120]
Thank God, that's no reason we survived it.

[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:32.780]
There you go.

[02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:36.860]
Anyway, I had enjoyable years there at WNC and I had a ball.

[02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:38.540]
Some of the people that were, you know.

[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:39.880]
Is there somebody that we know?

[02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:41.680]
You probably never heard of me.

[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:42.740]
You used to joke about it.

[02:24:42.740 --> 02:24:44.580]
Oh, why don't you call the garden guy?

[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:47.860]
You're the guy that did the gardening show?

[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:48.880]
Yeah, I'm IOD.

[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:49.560]
I'm IOD.

[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:53.460]
I was IOD for about five years, IOD for three years on the weekends.

[02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:54.000]
Yeah.

[02:24:54.260 --> 02:24:57.180]
And I had a ball and I really enjoyed most of the people that were there.

[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:00.580]
Now, some of the people that you hate were okay with me.

[02:25:00.860 --> 02:25:02.160]
But of course, now I was not radio.

[02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:06.120]
You know, I was an expert at the team and I did plants and that was my bag and I didn't

[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:07.140]
know the results about radio.

[02:25:07.660 --> 02:25:13.540]
And in fact, the general manager or the program director of WOD, I thought he was intriguing.

[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:14.960]
He used to call him the shark.

[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:16.620]
He walked up down the hall and his pen stripes.

[02:25:16.900 --> 02:25:17.720]
Who says name Mike?

[02:25:19.220 --> 02:25:19.560]
Remember him?

[02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:21.560]
We had a program director named Mike.

[02:25:21.940 --> 02:25:23.960]
Oh, we're at WIOD when you're a wind.

[02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:27.440]
And anyway, when he left WIOD.

[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:27.960]
Okay, thanks.

[02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:45.840]
126 and 560 WQM.

[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:48.300]
Like I said, like that music, baby.

[02:25:48.980 --> 02:25:53.780]
Neil and his music, a man in his music, you four man starts Monday here at 560, QAM.

[02:25:53.940 --> 02:25:54.140]
Up there.

[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:54.580]
Come on.

[02:25:54.580 --> 02:25:55.000]
Oh, right.

[02:25:56.460 --> 02:25:57.100]
I'm serious.

[02:25:58.500 --> 02:25:59.060]
I am.

[02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:01.800]
I mean, what would you rather hurt some of my great music here?

[02:26:01.860 --> 02:26:03.920]
Or this but you call us the last 40 minutes, huh?

[02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:05.620]
It's not even a contest, is it?

[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:05.840]
No.

[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:13.920]
No.

[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:20.260]
Oh, no.

[02:26:22.700 --> 02:26:26.180]
Four kids hanging up together.

[02:26:26.780 --> 02:26:28.920]
Ellie probes in their ass TV.

[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:29.760]
Don't get bad.

[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:30.540]
Welcome.

[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:41.720]
I'm going to be standing full up to dust if when these around.

[02:26:43.980 --> 02:26:47.500]
They're standing full up in tile and they're cawing dirt.

[02:26:47.940 --> 02:26:50.380]
And at least once a week we hear.

[02:26:51.180 --> 02:26:53.640]
And he'll say, you're bad, dad.

[02:26:55.060 --> 02:26:58.060]
Oh, it's so weird but the wonderful.

[02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:01.260]
And can he speak to them for the room?

[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:03.700]
He can't hit the head.

[02:27:04.380 --> 02:27:08.400]
And then he said, the rats know it him and then they eat it.

[02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:10.400]
They know.

[02:27:12.140 --> 02:27:13.220]
Thank you, Freddy.

[02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:14.860]
You're so good.

[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:17.400]
Okay.

[02:27:17.980 --> 02:27:19.040]
You want to know what I think?

[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:19.500]
What?

[02:27:22.020 --> 02:27:23.460]
It's going to be something, honey dad.

[02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:27.000]
It's going to be something to it.

[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:30.680]
I know what I'm going to do this weekend.

[02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:32.980]
I mean, you don't make any exciting plans in this town.

[02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:35.160]
But I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to lock the door.

[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:38.660]
I'm going to stay on the inside, like off in a corner, far away from the pewter.

[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:43.680]
And I'm just going to put my arms around my shoulders and sit in the corner and kind of plate my life.

[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:46.360]
Because after your son he died, and I mentioned this this morning, you know,

[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:49.440]
guys only 65 years old can happen at any time.

[02:27:50.100 --> 02:27:53.060]
And I'm envisioning another three and a half years of this,

[02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:55.580]
like this these last two weeks.

[02:27:56.180 --> 02:27:56.780]
No way.

[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:02.360]
Because any day you can croak, you know, especially when you're fat, all the years of abuse, you know,

[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:07.340]
all the years of choking on fat, eating all the wrong stuff, your organs are choking on each other, you know.

[02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:09.940]
Any day could be like the last breath.

[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:14.380]
And I'm sitting here making a good buck but nevertheless coming in.

[02:28:14.380 --> 02:28:17.860]
This is somebody's idea talking to guys like that last jackass,

[02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:20.460]
that last radio fossil there,

[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:26.160]
who claims to have been the gardening man like a talking double talk.

[02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:31.380]
And he's got a, a, a, a staff list of old phone numbers from 11 years ago.

[02:28:31.620 --> 02:28:32.500]
Do I want to hear the number?

[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:36.360]
I'd rather here go sabers.

[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:41.380]
And that's the worst thing I, I thought that was the worst thing I ever heard in my life.

[02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:45.860]
And just like I said the other day, please don't give me this baloney about,

[02:28:45.900 --> 02:28:49.480]
oh gee, we're all upset about the ball games, you know, take it up party, you're sure, why?

[02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:52.360]
What is it that's going on here these last two weeks?

[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:55.200]
I'm embarrassed to be associated not just with this radio station,

[02:28:55.520 --> 02:28:58.520]
with this program the last two weeks, with this audience the last two weeks.

[02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:02.800]
I'm not going to miss any meals.

[02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:06.660]
I don't have millions and millions stashed away, but I got enough I could live comfortably,

[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:10.300]
pay off my bills, sell my house, make a nice pin on the change on that,

[02:29:10.300 --> 02:29:15.520]
have the dog, let my mother take care of my dogs, give them the gas, you know what I'm talking about?

[02:29:16.100 --> 02:29:19.160]
And I just kind of wander off and never be seen again, get out of your hair.

[02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:26.300]
Because this is, this is, this isn't a job, this isn't even an exercise,

[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:28.720]
this is self-neutilation is what it is.

[02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:35.240]
The last 45, 50 minutes, whatever, when we started taking calls again,

[02:29:35.280 --> 02:29:36.800]
which was a bad mistake, the music was great.

[02:29:38.820 --> 02:29:41.260]
And there's, you know, to say it's one of the all-time worst,

[02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:43.060]
there's come in a lot of territory, a lot of years.

[02:29:43.580 --> 02:29:46.140]
One of the worst collections of people with nothing to say about anything,

[02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:48.600]
I've ever heard in my life, starting with a guy who said,

[02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:53.300]
go sabers, who thought he was a hockey expert, who didn't have a question,

[02:29:53.680 --> 02:29:56.880]
didn't have a comment, didn't have an observation, didn't have anything,

[02:29:57.480 --> 02:29:58.200]
go sabers.

[02:30:00.660 --> 02:30:04.720]
That was a phone call, that was a comment, that was a piece of verbal interchange

[02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:06.200]
in the South Florida area.

[02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:12.360]
In a place that is so dead, so devoid of any living and breathing qualities.

[02:30:12.740 --> 02:30:16.480]
And like I said the other day, and I take none of it back only on multiple times a million.

[02:30:16.940 --> 02:30:21.980]
Dead people, drifters, banana boat people, drug addicts.

[02:30:22.340 --> 02:30:25.920]
There you go, with some interchange, some crossover and all the categories.

[02:30:28.840 --> 02:30:32.640]
That's it, you take those groups out of this area, you've got like 20 of us left.

[02:30:34.860 --> 02:30:35.960]
Dear field beach, hello.

[02:30:36.700 --> 02:30:38.200]
Neil, we all love you too.

[02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:42.460]
And I know that gardening guy, I think I got some good seeds from him one time.

[02:30:42.580 --> 02:30:45.840]
Uh huh. Yeah, I think when we grow it out, it came out to be some...

[02:30:45.840 --> 02:30:47.340]
Okay, let's go to a Belgrade, hello.

[02:30:47.820 --> 02:30:48.780]
Yes, sir.

[02:30:49.020 --> 02:30:54.820]
Neil, I've noticed in my listening to you that you seem to have some type of version to God.

[02:30:55.160 --> 02:30:56.000]
I have a version?

[02:30:56.720 --> 02:30:58.800]
And I'd like a version, like the version Mary?

[02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:02.540]
No, I was wondering if maybe like you've been raped by a priest or something of the kid.

[02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:04.740]
No, I have not. I haven't been raped by anybody, have you?

[02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:05.320]
No.

[02:31:05.600 --> 02:31:08.460]
No, I just have a brain and I use it and I don't believe in fairy tales, do you?

[02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:13.240]
You say people like you make me sick because you think that's a fairy tale about God.

[02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:16.920]
No, it is fairy tales, it's ridiculous, it makes no sense to anybody who's a thinking person.

[02:31:17.140 --> 02:31:19.080]
Oh, you guys are close-minded, you think this isn't...

[02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:19.620]
Oh, you know me?

[02:31:19.660 --> 02:31:20.280]
Yeah, what do they know?

[02:31:20.500 --> 02:31:23.760]
You guys, like there's a group, anybody who doesn't believe what you do?

[02:31:23.980 --> 02:31:24.160]
Yeah.

[02:31:24.280 --> 02:31:24.720]
And this group?

[02:31:25.060 --> 02:31:25.640]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:31:25.880 --> 02:31:26.440]
Uh huh.

[02:31:26.440 --> 02:31:27.700]
It's like a conspiracy or something.

[02:31:27.860 --> 02:31:29.640]
In other words, oh, it's a conspiracy.

[02:31:29.940 --> 02:31:30.180]
Yeah.

[02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:32.480]
Maybe or maybe a comic, pinko conspiracy.

[02:31:32.860 --> 02:31:34.640]
No, I just want to get your own and your own little mind.

[02:31:34.780 --> 02:31:39.220]
Yeah, you got the little mind pal because if you believe that book, crap, you need serious stuff, you need assistance.

[02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:40.800]
I'm going to just ask.

[02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:41.560]
Okay.

[02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:43.240]
A good piece of ass might change your attitude.

[02:31:43.840 --> 02:31:44.800]
No, I'm sorry.

[02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:44.920]

[02:31:45.120 --> 02:31:45.720]
Yeah, I doubt it, right.

[02:31:47.320 --> 02:31:49.660]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, yeah, you, you people.

[02:31:50.080 --> 02:31:50.740]
You people?

[02:31:51.240 --> 02:31:52.440]
The Godless people.

[02:31:54.380 --> 02:32:01.020]
The people refuse to be morons and believe in the ramblings of idiots of lunatics that lived thousands of years ago.

[02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:06.040]
That every time somebody farted and with the wrong flavor was an act of God and God was pissed off.

[02:32:07.180 --> 02:32:10.480]
First of all, if there was a God with people fart, of course not.

[02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:13.140]
And if they did have to fart, would it smell like that?

[02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:13.420]
No.

[02:32:13.540 --> 02:32:15.560]
No, so right there, that's the end of the argument.

[02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:17.400]
Okay, it doesn't have to go into a big saw in it.

[02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:18.500]
Just think about that.

[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:18.980]
Okay.

[02:32:18.980 --> 02:32:23.320]
Next time you're in a crowded elevator and somebody, I hope it's not you that does it because it's embarrassing.

[02:32:24.440 --> 02:32:27.920]
Next time you're in a crowded elevator in the middle of July, and it's, you know, 100 degrees in the shade,

[02:32:28.200 --> 02:32:29.600]
and somebody cuts one real bad.

[02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:32.920]
Or you're in line at the supermarket and somebody in front of you, cuts one.

[02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:36.360]
Just ask yourself, if there were a God, would there be something like that?

[02:32:37.140 --> 02:32:38.960]
The answer clearly is, no.

[02:32:39.420 --> 02:32:41.720]
Next time you drop a load in the bowl, okay?

[02:32:42.440 --> 02:32:48.960]
And you're sitting there and you're squeezing and you're like, you're going through all of the gestations and gyrations that are sometimes necessarily the same.

[02:32:50.800 --> 02:32:54.340]
And you're looking to take a peek down in there, what you've left, and you smell that aroma.

[02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.560]
Ask yourself, would God create such a system for elimination?

[02:32:57.880 --> 02:32:58.820]
Or would it just be nature?

[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:00.920]
Since nature of course is like indifferent.

[02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:04.360]
Nature, you know, like crap happens, okay?

[02:33:04.600 --> 02:33:05.600]
Even that kind of crap.

[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:06.080]
That's right.

[02:33:07.780 --> 02:33:10.560]
God, you know, you press a button and like a little envelope comes in.

[02:33:10.640 --> 02:33:10.980]
That's it.

[02:33:11.060 --> 02:33:15.040]
You like to drop it in the box like the old Cuban woman, and maybe later you come back and look at it again.

[02:33:17.500 --> 02:33:18.220]
Not that.

[02:33:18.500 --> 02:33:21.140]
And then forget about diarrhea and constipation.

[02:33:22.460 --> 02:33:28.140]
And don't give me this stuff about human man-made because even animals out there in the wilderness, they all over the place.

[02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:29.480]
And it don't smell so good I'm told.

[02:33:32.740 --> 02:33:35.320]
You're looking to eat.

[02:33:35.980 --> 02:33:47.280]
Look, on masterpiece fears, the Tourette syndrome player presents Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.

[02:33:59.400 --> 02:33:59.440]
What light?

[02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:16.940]
The light?

[02:34:16.940 --> 02:34:16.940]

[02:34:16.940 --> 02:34:16.940]

[02:34:16.980 --> 02:34:17.000]
The light?

[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:17.560]
The light?

[02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:18.000]
The light?

[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:18.360]
The light?

[02:34:18.780 --> 02:34:19.180]
The light?

[02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:20.040]
The light?

[02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:21.500]
The light?

[02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:26.500]
The light?

[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:39.760]
The light?

[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:44.300]
The light?

[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:45.260]
Right.

[02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:48.140]
Now the lively system Theater?

[02:34:48.140 --> 02:34:48.140]

[02:34:48.140 --> 02:34:48.140]

[02:34:48.140 --> 02:34:51.480]
eastern classic purge rationalized apparently hosted soju-vog girls down you shell and, and then hits the festive.

[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:51.480]

[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:51.480]

[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:51.480]

[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:51.480]

[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:58.540]
something. Is that program director? Is that, is that scumbag still here? Because I'm going to

[02:34:58.540 --> 02:35:02.480]
tell you something there is something going on. And I've been doing this too long. You know, I've

[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:05.720]
been saying this for a long time. And the last two weeks since we moved up here especially,

[02:35:06.300 --> 02:35:11.900]
it's the whole phone system. And we got people playing grab ads with these on earphones all over

[02:35:11.900 --> 02:35:18.540]
the building. That's the second time on that one. We'll be put out of business here and in the

[02:35:18.540 --> 02:35:21.460]
meantime, the program director is worried about. Is it Kathleen going to be at the Princess

[02:35:21.460 --> 02:35:25.520]
Casino? Is the schedule right or not today? I'm a schedule. That's the kind of thing they're worried

[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:29.120]
about. And Greg Reed's running around. Look, I got a haircut and I'm spreading monowol over

[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:32.300]
the building. This is their idea of running a radio station, of doing business.

[02:35:35.340 --> 02:35:37.440]
Is there somebody on that line? Are you just testing it?

[02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:46.740]
Hello? Yes, sir. Okay, just happen again.

[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:49.940]
Is that on your hand?

[02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:56.500]
Okay, call me back. See what happens. I don't think so. That's the second or third time

[02:35:56.500 --> 02:36:01.860]
it's happening on that line today. I don't want to say that we got somebody playing fast and lose

[02:36:01.860 --> 02:36:04.820]
with our livelihood here. But you know, I think the only way I'm going to solve this is just

[02:36:04.820 --> 02:36:07.340]
tell him, look, when you decide you want to get around to these things, get these phone

[02:36:07.340 --> 02:36:10.560]
systems fixed up both on and off the air. They're not coming in here, maybe try to do a show.

[02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:13.960]
Maybe that's what I got to do. Because these people don't understand English.

[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:18.240]
And we're not even in, you know, we're in North Bay County. We're almost at the Broward line.

[02:36:18.540 --> 02:36:20.160]
We're not down there in Dominale Park.

[02:36:21.500 --> 02:36:23.020]
Here's a mobile in West Palm. Hello?

[02:36:23.700 --> 02:36:24.520]
Neil. Yes, sir.

[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:28.400]
Neil God. Uh-huh. Yeah, the phones are screwed up. How do you know that?

[02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:32.680]
Well, it was clicking off and I wasn't going through a bad cell every time I called.

[02:36:33.740 --> 02:36:36.360]
It was clicking off? Yeah, it was just clicking off. Yeah.

[02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:41.360]
And for a couple of miles. Anyway, what I wanted to ask you was, do you remember going back,

[02:36:41.620 --> 02:36:45.520]
you were talking about wrestlers before? Do you remember John DuPont? No.

[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:49.960]
No. Uh, you had that farm? I remember Donald DuPont.

[02:36:50.180 --> 02:36:51.680]
No, this was John DuPont.

[02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:55.820]
Didn't drive his finger up his rectum. He had a wrestling camp called Fox Hill.

[02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:59.620]
No, no. Shot one of his protege a few years back. No.

[02:37:00.260 --> 02:37:03.980]
Oh, okay. Well, he was really light and mover.

[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:06.820]
And you had a whole lot of... Oh, you're talking about the famous DuPont.

[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:10.160]
Right. Oh, yeah. When you started out by talking about professional wrestling,

[02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:13.220]
like it was a wrestling we were talking about. No, he had a wrestling.

[02:37:13.220 --> 02:37:16.460]
Yeah, right. I know. Right. Right. And I was like...

[02:37:16.460 --> 02:37:17.940]
Creatured in a bedbud, right? Yeah.

[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:21.320]
And he came in. He was trying to beat the case. He came in all...

[02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:23.940]
He was beaten at the end. Yeah. He shoveled in a jitter.

[02:37:24.220 --> 02:37:25.660]
Right. No shabin' I think.

[02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:28.300]
Well, what about him? Anyway, no, just saying...

[02:37:28.300 --> 02:37:32.400]
Okay, thanks. Okay, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60 on a mobile one line.

[02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:33.100]
Do you remember him? No.

[02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:35.220]
Here's a mobile in Davey. Hello?

[02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:37.980]
Oh, Neil? Yes, sir. How are you doing?

[02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:43.020]
Okay. It is a hockey, uh, as those years, that one is what's going with Pavell Brewery.

[02:37:43.020 --> 02:37:44.980]
But you're not right now when we need him. Uh-huh.

[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:48.940]
I don't get it. Some of the guys get slapped at him off with a skate,

[02:37:49.460 --> 02:37:51.400]
terminus lay the back on the ice. That's right.

[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:53.320]
Some guys get half of their teeth knocked out,

[02:37:53.500 --> 02:37:55.720]
and they go and get a few stitches, and they come back and next period,

[02:37:55.720 --> 02:37:57.300]
they're out there and finish the game. Exactly.

[02:37:57.640 --> 02:37:59.080]
And then... And kind of a coach when we got, you know,

[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:01.100]
some little underling, like a rookie, Mark Parrish,

[02:38:01.340 --> 02:38:02.540]
he, you know, overslates or something.

[02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:04.220]
When he goes to the wrong arena for practice,

[02:38:04.420 --> 02:38:06.620]
we sit him out, even though he's like one of our leading scorers,

[02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:07.560]
and we can't afford to do that.

[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:09.340]
But this guy, it will pay in $10 million.

[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:11.820]
It's like, well, you know, when he's good and ready,

[02:38:11.820 --> 02:38:13.480]
we don't want to push him too much, you know,

[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:15.820]
because God forbid he, uh, should get a hang-mail.

[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:17.300]
Exactly. I mean, it's going to be too late.

[02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:19.120]
They're not going to play in these games now.

[02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:21.060]
When the whole season is on the line,

[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:23.140]
then, uh, you know, what the hell is it all about?

[02:38:23.420 --> 02:38:26.000]
Exactly. Go out there just to make a stand like that,

[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.780]
and you don't have to be able to put that right now.

[02:38:28.100 --> 02:38:29.360]
Nobody's a bigger fan of his than me,

[02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:31.820]
but he's played a total of 11 games here so far.

[02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:34.380]
A total of 11 freaking games, sir.

[02:38:34.740 --> 02:38:35.740]
Exactly. And I don't want him.

[02:38:35.940 --> 02:38:37.460]
A hundred percent, if he's not a hundred percent,

[02:38:37.580 --> 02:38:39.160]
you know, with the last game in doubt,

[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:42.220]
uh, get him out to now at 80 percent for God's sake.

[02:38:42.300 --> 02:38:43.000]
I got news to you.

[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:46.860]
A pop-el-brie at 50 percent is better than most of the guys we got at 100 percent.

[02:38:46.940 --> 02:38:47.300]
Exactly.

[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:49.100]
Not to mention Bobby Needhamar again.

[02:38:49.140 --> 02:38:50.140]
Okay, God bless you, sir.

[02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:50.900]
There's somebody who cares.

[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:53.040]
What's the report? What's the story there?

[02:38:54.900 --> 02:38:55.260]
Huh?

[02:38:57.560 --> 02:38:59.320]
What's the story with the phone line?

[02:39:00.300 --> 02:39:02.060]
There was nobody, no one on it.

[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:03.120]
So what was that?

[02:39:03.580 --> 02:39:04.080]
We don't know.

[02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:06.660]
So maybe it's a Southern Bell job like I've been talking all along,

[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:08.200]
and they're patching around with our lines again,

[02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:10.380]
which they don't roll over and line eight doesn't work.

[02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:11.320]
And we don't know where they're coming in.

[02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:13.560]
I'm telling you, we had like a before we came in here,

[02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:15.680]
it's no coincidence that it started two weeks ago.

[02:39:15.740 --> 02:39:17.360]
I'm not, I'm not hallucinating, okay?

[02:39:17.980 --> 02:39:19.700]
Before we came in here, they added the eight-blind.

[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:21.320]
They went and they read the whole thing out there.

[02:39:21.580 --> 02:39:23.460]
And somewhere along the line, they've screwed this up.

[02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:25.480]
If it was just between 10 and two, I'd say,

[02:39:25.700 --> 02:39:28.020]
well, we're going through one of Neil's nervous breakdowns.

[02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:28.940]
You know, I didn't still want to talk to it.

[02:39:29.060 --> 02:39:30.080]
I hear it even Hank.

[02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:31.180]
And like I said the other day,

[02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:32.780]
when Hank's phone's out bringing it off,

[02:39:32.780 --> 02:39:34.220]
the hook, you know there's something wrong.

[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:36.800]
But please don't tell that to our people here in management.

[02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:39.700]
Because we have a bunch of pussy's here running his place

[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:42.140]
who will do absolutely nothing for you.

[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:47.340]
And I feel like a real bad fever in the sickness

[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:48.840]
coming on for a few days next week.

[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:50.100]
I could feel it right now.

[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:53.600]
Because when this is the coming,

[02:39:53.740 --> 02:39:56.360]
the fact that that phone is, if anybody out there

[02:39:56.360 --> 02:39:57.800]
who was interested in doing business,

[02:39:58.120 --> 02:39:59.520]
who'd come in here and see the kind of instrument

[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:01.500]
that George is trying to work with there in the phone too,

[02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:04.560]
you either laugh or cry or both.

[02:40:06.020 --> 02:40:07.060]
His phone rings.

[02:40:07.060 --> 02:40:08.880]
I'm talking about the business thing.

[02:40:08.980 --> 02:40:10.720]
We're trying to talk to people doing business

[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:12.920]
that associated with the show and this radio station.

[02:40:13.260 --> 02:40:14.020]
Hello, click.

[02:40:14.380 --> 02:40:16.240]
That's it. That's as far as the conversation goes.

[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:22.600]
And like I said, I wouldn't take no for an answer for a moment.

[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:24.080]
You know, like I said the other day,

[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:25.340]
our chief engineer, our program.

[02:40:25.860 --> 02:40:27.020]
Yeah, that's great.

[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:28.260]
You're coming here and there.

[02:40:29.060 --> 02:40:29.460]
Yeah.

[02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:30.400]
You know, yeah.

[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:31.200]
Yeah.

[02:40:32.140 --> 02:40:34.540]
You couldn't get anything done if somebody stuck an uzi up your ass.

[02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:35.300]
Okay, Duff.

[02:40:36.220 --> 02:40:38.260]
That's the kind of management we've gotten in this place.

[02:40:38.540 --> 02:40:39.900]
This isn't something that's going to wait.

[02:40:40.060 --> 02:40:41.600]
Remember what Michael said in Godfather one?

[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:42.620]
It can't wait.

[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:43.240]
Remember that?

[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:47.700]
When he had his jaw swollen up there, it can't wait.

[02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:51.360]
Here's a mobile in Hylia.

[02:40:51.420 --> 02:40:51.600]
Hello.

[02:40:51.740 --> 02:40:52.440]
Hello, the call call.

[02:40:53.340 --> 02:40:53.980]
Small fry.

[02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:57.040]
Yeah, small fry in the large, large soda.

[02:40:57.380 --> 02:40:58.660]
Hey, Neil, sorry about that.

[02:40:58.660 --> 02:40:59.140]
That was a sugar.

[02:40:59.380 --> 02:41:00.140]
Hold the answer card.

[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:03.080]
Yeah, like I kind of stole my son.

[02:41:03.080 --> 02:41:05.260]
I wanted to see if I got this right with Pat Vell.

[02:41:05.500 --> 02:41:05.520]
Yeah.

[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:07.240]
The doctors have heard of the play.

[02:41:07.460 --> 02:41:07.600]
Yeah.

[02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:09.060]
The doctors have heard of the play.

[02:41:09.220 --> 02:41:11.260]
Is his decision now that he doesn't want to?

[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:11.740]
That's right.

[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:12.960]
It's not the coaches decision.

[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:14.880]
It's not the general managers decision.

[02:41:15.140 --> 02:41:16.800]
It's not the dog catchers decision.

[02:41:17.100 --> 02:41:17.960]
It's his decision.

[02:41:18.100 --> 02:41:19.480]
He's going to let us know what he's good and ready.

[02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:21.020]
And he says it ain't ready.

[02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:22.360]
And it's the meat also.

[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:24.200]
This is when we need him the most.

[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:27.120]
Yeah, he says can't you see it swollen in my knee too?

[02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:28.820]
That's what he said.

[02:41:29.540 --> 02:41:30.400]
Oh, all right.

[02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:33.340]
Just let you know I called a while ago when you were complaining

[02:41:33.340 --> 02:41:35.680]
that you had no calls and the lines were busy.

[02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:38.060]
I don't know if you if you if they were just tied up

[02:41:38.060 --> 02:41:39.460]
if it was a bell-salt thing or not.

[02:41:39.460 --> 02:41:41.300]
Sure, I have no idea what's going on here.

[02:41:41.300 --> 02:41:44.460]
All I know is that we desperately somebody in this radio station

[02:41:44.460 --> 02:41:46.300]
to intercede and take the bull by the horns

[02:41:46.300 --> 02:41:48.900]
and they absolutely refuse to get involved in this.

[02:41:49.140 --> 02:41:50.740]
And if the program director is in the building

[02:41:50.740 --> 02:41:51.920]
when I get off the earth two o'clock,

[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:54.760]
I'm going to go in there and I'm going to whatever kind of a desk he's got now.

[02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:56.240]
I'm just going to turn it right over on the floor

[02:41:56.240 --> 02:41:57.800]
because I'm nauseated by him.

[02:41:57.860 --> 02:41:58.920]
I'm revolted by him.

[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:01.000]
A man who does absolutely nothing tangible

[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:04.040]
that we can discover nothing zero.

[02:42:04.420 --> 02:42:06.540]
And that also goes for the chief and the other day.

[02:42:07.500 --> 02:42:08.340]
Have a great time.

[02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:08.920]
All right, Neil.

[02:42:09.220 --> 02:42:10.380]
I'll see you at the game.

[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:11.100]
God bless you.

[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:11.600]
I'll be there.

[02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:13.040]
I'll be there.

[02:42:13.060 --> 02:42:14.200]
I'm going to sit there all by myself.

[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:15.840]
Okay, I'm not even going to give my other seat away.

[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:16.920]
I'm just going to sit there by myself.

[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:17.820]
Don't even bother me.

[02:42:17.820 --> 02:42:19.660]
Okay, I'm just going to sit there with my phone in my arm.

[02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:21.020]
Just tuck it on my thumb.

[02:42:22.060 --> 02:42:22.520]
That's right.

[02:42:24.620 --> 02:42:26.140]
I mean, we know that they don't care.

[02:42:26.260 --> 02:42:27.240]
But they're just some things.

[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:29.640]
I mean, a lot of things that the audience can hear

[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:30.560]
and that aren't obvious.

[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:32.680]
You can try to hide it like all those spots,

[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:34.760]
you know, that are coming all over on the audio net

[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:36.720]
that the 10-year-old kids are dubbing

[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:39.480]
with the pot open so they sound like they're feeding back

[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:40.220]
right on the air.

[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:41.280]
Real tinny and crappy.

[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:42.940]
And we expect people to pay for them.

[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:46.640]
There's no pride.

[02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:47.760]
There's no professionalism.

[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:48.480]
There's no interest.

[02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:49.220]
There's no concern.

[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:51.560]
There's just nobody here you can talk to on that level.

[02:42:54.140 --> 02:42:56.820]
You know, I don't care about the Florida Marlins.

[02:42:56.820 --> 02:42:58.160]
I don't care about John Henry.

[02:42:58.480 --> 02:42:59.900]
I don't care about all these silly things

[02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:00.900]
that Greg Reed comes in here

[02:43:00.900 --> 02:43:01.960]
and keeps talking to me about.

[02:43:02.280 --> 02:43:03.340]
Talk turkey one day.

[02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:04.200]
Talk business.

[02:43:04.540 --> 02:43:06.160]
Talk about doing something for us.

[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:08.280]
He doesn't care.

[02:43:08.420 --> 02:43:10.720]
All he sees is a log that's got 8 million spots on it.

[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:13.020]
They're running 55 minutes an hour in the morning drive.

[02:43:13.620 --> 02:43:15.740]
They're slumping a hanker rod like a goddamn play doll

[02:43:15.740 --> 02:43:16.560]
all over the place.

[02:43:16.700 --> 02:43:17.680]
Even if they can kill him.

[02:43:17.900 --> 02:43:19.040]
Maybe they can catch up with Sonny Herc

[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:20.440]
with a hankle be next in line

[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:21.860]
at the time they're finished with him.

[02:43:24.700 --> 02:43:26.140]
I'm sending him over to do a goddamn show

[02:43:26.140 --> 02:43:27.520]
at the stadium there

[02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:29.500]
and out in the middle of a cow pasture.

[02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:32.560]
Having to run having to do the 600 yard run

[02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:33.300]
to get on the air

[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:34.780]
putting him in the hospital.

[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:36.600]
And then saying, oh,

[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:37.840]
G, we're so concerned.
