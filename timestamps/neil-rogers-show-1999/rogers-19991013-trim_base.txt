[00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.560]
Sport Radio 560 WQAM Miami 4 Flutterdale presents the Neil Rogers

[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.560]
Yachter Talked to Neil called 560 560 toll free for native

[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.360]
power and down 560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.080]
The opinions of Neil is yes, allers are anyone else on the show do not necessarily

[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.040]
reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisitions or the easily broadcast group.

[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.140]
Now Neil Rogers on Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.240]
Head Marliner on 4th radio.

[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.520]
Oh!

[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.600]
WQAM!

[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.200]
Yeah!

[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.840]
Swinging on.

[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.700]
All right.

[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.140]
When the Nazis reign they reign before half-view panning.

[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.840]
Yes.

[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.020]
Now the KKK has good days because of your parents.

[00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:05.120]
And if you are yellow for purple or god for this brown you'll be like no

[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.240]
solidy hanging upside-down.

[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.300]
You can lock and roll your gun with half-empower.

[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.100]
But if you want to kill those lights step into the showers and that's your

[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.720]
precincts that gas and your right suspect.

[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.440]
Are you glad that you voted for pack today?

[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.980]
Half-view panning.

[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.660]
And I was good 560 WQAM on a very strange Wednesday.

[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.480]
Must be chronic Wednesday based on last few minutes I heard they're in the worst

[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.940]
team must be all chronicers.

[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.340]
That what it is.

[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.080]
Evidently.

[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.720]
So, Suzanne Smith and point and beat sense of me and I asked for guess what's

[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.440]
Suzanne and I want to nip this in the bug because I don't want to waste any time

[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.900]
here today with these people crawling.

[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.780]
Oh, Neo to see that front line thing on PBS about the Russian mafia and the

[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.960]
Asian hockey league and Papa.

[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.300]
No, I did not see it because it was on CBC like two years ago and it's an

[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.320]
old rehash and it's very old news and it's much you do about nothing.

[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.780]
And it's quite about PFO is going on about this morning.

[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.880]
Much you do about nothing.

[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.660]
But thank you Suzanne.

[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.960]
Thank you for the facts.

[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.700]
Now they're going to be people wanting to talk about that and I don't want to

[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.520]
talk about it because it's a bunch of crap.

[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.480]
It's a bunch of stale old news.

[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.960]
You know like Mussolini's got a headache stuff like that.

[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.720]
Well, I guess Wilta still won't have a and when they called him,

[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.940]
Wilta still, I never really understood for sure what that meant.

[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.140]
Now I think we know for sure he won't have no more headaches.

[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.480]
Sex claims spurred last in the stain.

[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.320]
Wilta is dead at 63.

[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.480]
The claim was shocking.

[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.240]
Wilta said he had sex with 20,000 women.

[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.980]
The revelation made him fodder for comedians and turned the hall of fame or into a reference

[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.740]
for a sexual braggadocio.

[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.440]
Maybe we'll find out today which guy in this audience has had sex with most women.

[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.180]
What would be a believable number?

[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.020]
Not in the thousand certainly.

[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.440]

[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.780]
Two, three dozen this week.

[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.360]
In his 1991 biography of you from above and he did mean above as in looking down there,

[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.240]
looking down below.

[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.580]
Chamberlain, oh, on your seven, one, everybody is underneath you.

[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.040]
Chamberlain devoted an entire chapter to sex.

[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.420]
He said that if he had a counter sexual encounters, he'd be closing it on 20,000 women.

[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.340]
Yes, that's correct.

[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.340]
20,000 different ladies he wrote.

[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.660]
Not the same woman like over and over again because you know,

[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.700]
Variety be the spice alive.

[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.660]
20,000 different bitches.

[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.120]
Wonder if any of them are like co-chorus.

[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.840]
How about you, he didn't have to do co-chorus, you know, I'm saying OJ?

[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.740]
Anyway, at my age that equals up to having sex with 1.2 women a day every day since I was 15.

[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.840]
Where do you have sex with that point two of a woman, huh?

[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.740]
I sure hope not an error.

[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.120]
Correct him.

[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.840]
God.

[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.060]
The reaction was swift and severe.

[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.320]
Chamberlain jokes abounded.

[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.520]
They also became a lightning rod.

[00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.180]
For those who have sex with 20,000 women, you must have a lightning rod.

[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.760]
For those disgusted by his promiscuity.

[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.080]
Arthur Asheville, people harshly criticized Chamberlain and magic Johnson,

[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.100]
the former Lakers star who announced that he had contracted the AIDS virus months after Chamberlain's

[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.460]
revelation.

[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.840]
In his 1993 memoir, Ashe said he didn't believe Chamberlain's claim.

[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.420]
I felt more pity than sorrow for Willis as much of accounting back for her down in the form of

[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.380]
a wave of public criticism.

[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.760]
But you know what, I don't think he cared about the public criticism.

[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.780]
Do you?

[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.180]
No.

[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.660]
No, he didn't.

[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.460]
He just figured about getting laid.

[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.420]
He was having a good time.

[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.700]
See, I don't like goody-two shoes, you know?

[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.420]
I don't like that.

[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.380]
I just can't stand goody-two shoes.

[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.160]
If he had sex with 40,000 women, that's his business.

[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.100]
And if he had big enough balls to brag about it, what's wrong with that?

[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.800]
I guarantee there was probably a lot more truth to that than a lot of you guys out there,

[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.100]
especially these locker room types that are always bragging about how much they're getting laid,

[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.860]
who haven't gotten laid, maybe ever, in fact.

[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.300]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.600]
Uh-huh.

[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.340]
Yeah, you know the types.

[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.460]
Oh yeah, I did this one.

[00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.780]
I did.

[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.860]
Of course, they're not doing anybody except maybe themselves, maybe if they can find it.

[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.560]
So Wilk the Stilt is dead and of course we'll find out today if we got anybody in the

[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.680]
audience can measure up to him.

[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.940]
Of course, he was 7'1".

[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.100]
He was a very grotesque looking guy.

[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.220]
There's no question about that.

[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.700]
As most seven, at very few 7'2 guys who are good looking, let's face it.

[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.980]
He was especially, I mean, imposing gruesome looking guy.

[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.220]
But when you're 7'1, can you just imagine what he was dragging around?

[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.320]
Here's Carl Spring, hello.

[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.560]
Good morning Neil, how are you?

[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.100]
Okay, sir.

[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.800]
You just reminded me of that scene in young Falkenstein where she, uh, Terry Garfield,

[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.200]
he must have had a large bunch of muckin' doors.

[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.600]
Right, something like that, yeah.

[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.600]
So I have a just a couple of quick points and I'll let you go.

[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.620]
I don't, because I don't want to ruin the first call of the day.

[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.740]
But vanilla ice cream, what's your, what, what are you like vanilla?

[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.760]
And I'll get to Wilk.

[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.900]
I like vanilla.

[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.080]
I like to revolve up.

[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.520]
I even like Kate Winslet.

[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.420]
Yeah, well you have crappy taste, what can I say?

[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.640]
I don't know.

[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.360]
You're like, not everybody can have good taste.

[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.340]
I know, I know.

[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.600]
Um, I think if you divide Wilk three bounds by the number of women he slept with,

[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.060]
you can probably accumulate a good IQ in that sense.

[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.940]
Okay, thank you.

[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.360]
You're welcome.

[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.840]
And maybe maybe, uh, the trellis on a shopping spree.

[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.520]
Probably.

[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.840]
That's dillards with, uh, with Warwick.

[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.960]
Or Peter Warwick, I'm sorry.

[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.260]
I can't, I keep confusing Warwick done and Peter Warwick,

[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.140]
because like I said the other day,

[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.280]
and I'm the only one that pays any attention to these things.

[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.040]
Don't you find it a little bit strange that the same college,

[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.940]
the same university,

[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.020]
simultaneously, they both did play together at the same time.

[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.980]
Until Warwick done the, uh, moving on to the pros.

[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.260]
But, uh, I mean, what is that?

[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.080]
All they need to do is have dnwarwick come and sing the national anthem at their games now.

[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.640]
So maybe that's where spree was.

[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.640]
He was on a shopping spree at dillards with those, uh,

[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.140]
other boys with those other shows.

[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.000]
Had some ugly stuff there in Montreal last night.

[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.780]
It wasn't bad enough that the game was so bad.

[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.540]
Oh god, that was a horrendous game.

[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.260]
But, uh,

[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.460]
Pavel Burry with a groin.

[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.500]
Scott Melon be with a scary, scary smash into the boards right at the, uh,

[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.860]
was siren there at the end of the game with a concussion.

[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.200]
I think seldom as any team won a game in the history of their franchise.

[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.220]
And the head of the, is costly.

[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.900]
Is that when was for the pranthers last night?

[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.220]
That was gruesome to watch.

[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.340]
Of course, I get a little problem with ruts in the ice.

[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.020]
How long have I been talking about that?

[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.100]
I've been screaming about that and nobody seems to care.

[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.960]
And the season's not even two weeks old this year.

[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.880]
Already you got all these guys getting suspended for beating the crap out of each other.

[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.320]
Sparing and slashing and, uh, just all kinds of unconscionable,

[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.140]
unacceptable crap.

[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.420]
And you got all these guys getting injured already because the ice is so bad.

[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.800]
That's why Burry went down.

[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.940]
I mean, uh, you know, maybe people don't want to tell you that.

[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.700]
There was a run in the ice.

[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.680]
That happened here last year.

[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.080]
The first game that he played here.

[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.500]
Felt on a couple of times.

[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.420]
You see it here all the time.

[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.780]
Bad ice all over the league.

[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.640]
Does Gary Betman care?

[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.780]
Nobody in the league care?

[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:39.960]
No.

[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.580]
No, it's only these guys livelihoods.

[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.300]
And the same thing happened to Melon be there at the end.

[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.340]
Rutt in the ice.

[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.080]
Boom down.

[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.260]
He went, spin around or right with a head into the boards.

[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.120]
It looked really scary.

[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.920]
Just laid there, laid there for like an interminable time.

[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.460]
Took him to the hospital in Montreal last night.

[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:56.980]
1215.

[00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:57.540]
He walked out.

[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.340]
He's got a concussion.

[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:58.780]
Thank God.

[00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.580]
Nothing worse than that.

[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.780]
But a horrendous grotesque scene to have to watch there last night.

[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.900]
And the game wasn't too great either.

[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:06.620]
Horrendous.

[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.800]
We'll take the two points.

[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.200]
Thank you.

[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.100]
But not too, uh, pretty.

[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.880]
Eight minutes after 10.

[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.260]
We got more OJ stuff today.

[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.580]
Oh, never ends.

[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.720]
It just never ends.

[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.340]
It never be ended.

[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.400]
And then we got Mayor Pinguas all over the place.

[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.820]
Nice going, CBS.

[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.720]
They'd Mayor Orders, Polis,

[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.840]
Descrap spare guns.

[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.500]
How do you like that?

[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.560]
Yeah, he got's how it is guns down by CBS.

[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.100]
That Mayor Pinguas man.

[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:29.780]
He's an asshole.

[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.040]
Something you're looking at him and you know what he looks like?

[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.420]
He looks like a stupid little twerp.

[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.040]
Idiotic.

[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.120]
Yeah, that too.

[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.420]
And you know what?

[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.720]
He looks like it because that's what he is.

[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.820]
He's a little punky, stupid idiotic jerk.

[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.260]
That's what he is.

[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.740]
A little wise guy, a little dummy.

[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.780]
Yeah, a little piece of crap.

[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.560]
Most of us have had more meaningful stuff come out of our

[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.940]
rectum in our lives than him.

[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.440]
I would even dignify him by calling him a turd.

[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.460]
That would be an insult to turds all over the world.

[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.100]
That's what Jason said.

[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.900]
You know, anal Jason, that's either busy dropping him or just

[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.740]
I facsimly thereof.

[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.120]
What is his story, by the way?

[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:12.900]
Why is he so anal?

[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.360]
Oh, that's right.

[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.380]
I forgot he's a sports nerd.

[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.280]
Jewish sports nerd.

[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.440]
Kind of like what's his name?

[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:19.760]
Claret?

[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.520]
No, no.

[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.400]
Oh, by the way, Claret stops sucking hanks ass so much.

[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.700]
Will your Claret Jesus Christ?

[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.260]
You know, and Hank yesterday, what happened?

[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.160]
Hank, he's one day he's like rational.

[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.640]
The next day he's regressing.

[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.160]
Just when I think he's on the right road to recovery,

[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.140]
he's back sucking Eddie Pope's ass again yesterday.

[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.560]
Oh, Hank, come on.

[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.580]
What a disgusting thought that is.

[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.440]
Eddie, the Pope rhymes with dope,

[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.480]
has written anything coherent in a hundred years.

[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.400]
Even mentioned Eddie Pope, but everybody in town will laugh their ass off.

[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.380]
And Hank was just had his head all the way in there yesterday.

[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.900]
So I sure hope that the stuff he got off Jimmy

[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.580]
doesn't rub off inside of Eddie Pope.

[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.440]
Oh, that was terrible.

[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.700]
But anyway, you know, you're entitled a little bad opinion every now and then.

[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.620]
You'll write your thoughts on a business trip in the middle of

[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.620]
and I pulled into a giner with a

[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.460]
so I could call the boys back up.

[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.980]
But first I decided to get something.

[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.780]
I ordered them.

[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.300]
But frankly, it was a little underdone.

[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.120]
After a couple of minutes, I started to

[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.640]
and I had to make a straight for the

[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.480]
I proceeded to my guts out.

[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.300]
And when I came back out, I felt so bad that I decided to

[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.700]
my doctor.

[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.720]
So I over to the

[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.800]
picked up the and call the

[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.120]
operator.

[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.740]
I gave her my doctor's number and she told me I'd have to deposit big

[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.400]
so I told her I was out of change and that this was a medical

[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.800]
well, she just

[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.680]
oh and then she

[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.480]
on me after I got out of the hospital.

[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.360]
I canceled my

[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.480]
card bought a big and went down to the phone company to

[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.960]
her brains out.

[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.160]
Look, I may be

[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.180]
but nobody's going to make it out of me.

[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.900]
1015 at 560 WQM Hanklebeyond and 2

[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.220]
we got 6 o'clock to boost your

[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.640]
Panthers at Toronto to play those may believe 7 o'clock tonight.

[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.280]
So the OJ saga continues now there's

[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.440]
you know and of course everybody else is a liar.

[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.460]
It's kind of like around here.

[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.180]
Everybody else is a liar except for

[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.440]
calls up 911 calls the police.

[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.500]
They're playing the transcripts on every goddamn channel.

[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.580]
It's ever been invented and something that aren't on the area yet.

[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.220]
They got it right there on tape but all it was a misunderstanding

[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.980]
and he never said it was her.

[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.800]
It was some other girl and he never said it was Pedro Guerrero.

[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.800]
That was also misunderstanding and etc and so on.

[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.380]
Jesus Christ talk about a bunch of neurotic crap.

[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.000]
Just what we needed here in South Florida was more neurotic crap.

[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.940]
Now the mom and of course you remember the blonde the

[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.020]
Nicole look alike that the one in between between when he murdered Nicole and

[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.500]
then this one.

[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.100]
The blonde they was hanging out with that he supposedly was going off to the

[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.140]
Bahamas to their love nest and then their parents said

[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.480]
she said uh wait I don't think so goodbye.

[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.100]
And they kept talking about drugs and all the coke.

[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.680]
How come that coke thing keeps sticking its ugly white nose into what everywhere he goes

[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.940]
or is it the other way around.

[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.040]
He keeps sticking its and itself into his nose everywhere it goes.

[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:12.480]
Yeah.

[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.360]
Mama of OJ's girlfriend I hope they break up.

[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.420]
He should only croak I think is what she means.

[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.940]
The mother of OJ Simpson's girlfriend Christy Prody said her

[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.100]
daughter has been trying to break off the romance and even move to South

[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.820]
Florida for a new life but the former football star keeps pursuing her

[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.180]
is the word pursuing or maybe stalking.

[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.400]
She told me they weren't seeing each other but she still talks to him so that

[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.860]
means he can still get to her and visit her.

[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.880]
Kathy Belmore said on Tuesday from Reminiapolis home I hope they break up.

[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.140]
On Sunday Simpson and Prody argued in the west kennet her west kennel townhouse

[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.600]
Simpson called 911 seeking help saying Prody was high on drugs.

[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.160]
Prody 26 it works in the skincare business move to South Florida from Los Angeles

[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.720]
couple months ago and Simpson 52 is the size of California is a frequent visitor to her least

[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.780]
unit. He's bringing her unit his unit to her unit.

[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.360]
On Tuesday they were both explaining away the fight and

[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.800]
please for help saying it all been a big misunderstanding.

[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.740]
Right Simpson who flew back to Los Angeles told KABC television the incident had nothing

[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.340]
to do with me my girlfriend and Prody echoed that outside her time I was saying

[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.040]
the woman Simpson to describe as being loaded out of her mind was not her

[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.100]
but a mutual female friend somebody else I had nothing to do with it.

[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.260]
But but the Mimee did county officer responded to the

[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:38.180]
servant's call on Tuesday said read my report it's all there read my lips.

[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:44.720]
In the report officer Alan de Hazus quote Simpson naming Prody and ledging she is the one

[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.320]
with the drug problem. Prody's mother has done the same thing in several tabloid TV shows.

[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.000]
She said the football star acquitted of the murder of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend

[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.580]
is a bad influence on her daughter. Prody met Simpson almost three years ago while she worked as a

[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:05.480]
cocktail waitress. I remember Frato he was banging cocktail waitresses to at a time.

[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:11.080]
Customers couldn't even get a drink. She didn't use to do drugs until they started

[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.420]
hanging around together Bellmore said how do you like that? Yeah do we believe that?

[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.860]
I don't know maybe she just had a little nose problem I have no idea.

[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.960]
See George has got this thing about coke horse crack horse. I don't have a thing about him.

[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.020]
I just know about him. Oh well that's what I'm talking about. You probably do some

[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.740]
most of them. That alleged drug use that does make a difference.

[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.900]
Probably some people around the building have some connections. Maybe they even have

[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:43.300]
Pedro Guerrero's home phone number. That alleged drug use is what brought Miami-Dade police to the

[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.840]
townhouse on Sunday night. A minute earlier Simpson called 911 complaining that his girlfriend

[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.620]
was out of the influence at center and so on. And then of course not about the Hazus gave the

[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:56.120]
domestic violence brochure and left with his partner. He said I got the impression he was

[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:01.540]
going to look for Prody. Then the other article, the other article, even better.

[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:10.300]
This is great. Two police officers arrived at the townhouse and found only Simpson there and

[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:15.620]
their report they wrote. Mr. Simpson advised that he and his girlfriend Ms. Prody were having

[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:21.160]
a verbal dispute. Mr. Simpson further advised that Ms. Prody was under the influence of an

[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:27.000]
unknown substance. Mr. Simpson then advised Ms. Prody that he was going to take her to the hospital

[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.580]
for treatment. At this time Ms. Prody told Mr. Simpson that he was going to call police if he didn't

[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:37.880]
leave. How do you like that? She was going to call the police if he didn't leave. Isn't the

[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:45.300]
starting to sound awfully familiar again? Oh, man. I'm concerned from Ms. Prody's safety. Mr. Simpson

[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:51.200]
called 911. Ms. Prody then fled the scene in an unknown direction in the listed vehicle A

[00:15:51.200 --> 00:16:00.480]
White 1997 Ford. A White 1997 Ford Mustang convertible. Damn it. Wouldn't that have been perfect

[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.780]
if it were a White Ford Bronco? Oh my God. We'd have been wet in our pants right now.

[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:12.740]
A White Mustang convertible with California tags parked in front of Prody's townhouse was Monday.

[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:17.780]
Monday was at least in her name in 1997 record show. The officers gave Simpson a domestic violence

[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.980]
brochure and then left. And now they're both saying all we had nothing to do with that. It was

[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.700]
somebody else and we don't know no Pedro Guerrero and etc. So we don't know no Godfather.

[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.440]
He was once in the olive oil business with some crack hole but other than that he don't know God

[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:39.680]
no Godfather and that's the end of that. Lies and bullcrap and just psychosis coming right here to

[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:45.360]
your town boys and girls just what we needed was another crazy person. Stay here. That's just what we

[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:52.520]
needed. Just go away. Oh man. That's what we say. Don't go away man. Just go away. Oh man.

[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:57.400]
Just take all your crack holes and all your bullcrap and all your threads and 911 calls. Just take

[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.380]
it someplace else. And the best part of it is the channel for interviews that they were they interviewed

[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:06.220]
her. So they got some other friend. He was either Haitian or like some I don't know some Caribbean

[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:10.820]
jungle guy. They got him on there and he comes up with this story about oh no it was all

[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.260]
big misunderstanding with some other girl that they were concerned about and they didn't know what to

[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.800]
do with her because they were so terrified she was all messed up on drugs and so they called

[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:24.200]
OJ and LA and he flew down here to take care of the problem. Yeah well you know it's only you know

[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.800]
you make your reservation you hop on the plane. So they want seven hours by the time you get to the

[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.320]
airport you get to if you're assuming you get a flight right away and a five hour flight and you

[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.860]
get down here and you know how fast you can run through that that hurts counter to get to renaissance.

[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.420]
Does anybody believe that story? No of course not.

[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:51.420]
More crazy crazy crap all circling around oh man our good best buddy of Roy some of the other

[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:56.320]
people in this building and they can't figure out why we just you know see I don't like scumbags

[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.940]
even assuming he didn't murder those two people which we know for sure he did but even assuming

[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:08.000]
he didn't he still a scumbag he's the lowest form of subhuman scum we don't want anything to do

[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.880]
with him we don't want in here we have enough scumb here already you could put the chicken fat

[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:17.020]
in your refrigerator uncovered overnight and never be able to scrape off enough scumb like you

[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:24.220]
got here already so the last thing we need here is more scumb. Speaking of the mayor by the way

[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.180]
Cuban band faces battle over encore oh that's right they're not going to just sit back and take

[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:37.560]
this real easy citing concerns over pubic safety local officials said Tuesday they were

[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:43.240]
exploring ways to block a promised return engagement by Cuban dance band low spam band who

[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.280]
saturday in a concert at the Miami arena prompted some Cuban exiles demonstrating outside to

[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.960]
hurl slurs and bottles of concert goers. Miami did mayor Alex Pinga said he was drafting a letter

[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.100]
to the White House on the US State Department asking officials to deny visas that would allow the

[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:01.000]
band to return to the US take away their visa domestic card and their god damn discover card how

[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:07.680]
do you like that uh-huh but state department officials said public safety concerns based on

[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.300]
recent protests are not grounds for denying those band band visas as long as promoters obey federal

[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:17.720]
rules limiting the money the band receives the travel expenses in a small per diem separately

[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:22.440]
Miami city attorney Alandro Vela Rello whatever the hell is named is De La Reo began exploring

[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.000]
other threats of physical harm to concert goers and demonstrators could prompt the city to seek

[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.020]
a quarter order to block a return performance by lowest band band and pedals now wait till you

[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:35.820]
hear this i mean do you talk about a slap in the face this guy must take were all as dumb as he is

[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.620]
this mayor Pinga that's why he put that penny sales tax out of balance he thought you people were

[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:49.180]
just as stupid as he is mayor Pinga says he thinks Castro sympathizers and agents were posing

[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:55.360]
as demonstrators outside saturday's concert to edge egg on the crowd he's got egg on his push

[00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:00.400]
for saying something like that because all those other good upstanding Cubans we know they would

[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.580]
never do anything like that it's all a communist plot that's right and he said they would do so

[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.840]
again if the band is there in December these same comedy a pinko sympathizers and the crappest

[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.120]
servers be out there again hurling rocks and bottles and it goes his good constituents they don't

[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:20.160]
do crap like that god this is a crazy person this is a person who belongs in a goddamn rubber room

[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:26.340]
it is my obligation is mayor to protect the safety and welfare of people in this community

[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:30.260]
you said los band band came they had their day and their rights of the concert course were

[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.980]
protected yadda yadda yadda et cetera and so on in the concert they lost all that money why the

[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.600]
whole thing come back oh handy and by the way did he oh handy and said she lost 50 grand on

[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.860]
Saturday but expect to show profits from the second concert and you know something we don't care

[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:50.260]
that's her problem the focus on public safety by local officials stems from recognition that the

[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:55.760]
first amendment how do you like that grudging recognition that the first amendment makes it virtually

[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.580]
impossible for government to stop los band band from performing so they have to come up with some

[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:05.440]
of their cockamama excuse like they really care about the welfare and the safety of the public

[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.620]
just like they cared about the welfare and safety of the public like if people were going to like

[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:14.460]
be dying and have to go by ambulance to the hospital over on the causeway a few months ago when

[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:19.860]
the same crazy people or people of their ilk were blocking the goddamn roads because they were

[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:26.440]
pissed off at the coast guard you're care about the safety and the welfare of the public you lying

[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:34.000]
sack a crap who the hell are you kidding man what a jackass what a disgrace

[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:41.020]
and speaking of jackasses commissioner Tomas regalato tried it and failed on Tuesday

[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.140]
get the city commission to approve a resolution ordering the municipal officials to prevent another

[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:50.140]
concert by the band which would have been pointless anyway as Howard Simon the executive director

[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.980]
of the ACL you points out he says the suit by the city would be stupid and endless and absolutely a

[00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:01.720]
losing lawsuit they haven't got a god damn total stand on right as well bringing peg-leg

[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:07.900]
baits they're concerned about the safety and the welfare of this community so a bunch of

[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:14.500]
his constituents want to go out there and block off the goddamn roads and create a goddamn hazard

[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:20.300]
and prevent ambulances and other emergency vehicles from getting from point a to point b then they

[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.300]
got nothing to say about that then it's okay and they understand it they're they're sympathizing

[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:29.580]
with them and holding their goddamn hand the same people are so concerned about the only thing

[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:34.880]
they're concerned about is pandering again to these anti-communist the crazy people that's all

[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.860]
you care about they are penga you're not fooling anybody and we saw that election on July 27 we

[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.600]
simple but accurate method of counting how many chicks I'd thank in college yeah we had a

[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:56.760]
Mima roommate had a we had a huge corona bottle that was like a piggy bank an oversized piggy bank

we put a coin in there the next day every time we were dumb dangling bang and a chick so idea I

[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:08.520]
must for my fourth year of college I counted up at about two sixty he had about two twenty so I

[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:12.640]
don't know how to give her take a couple around two sixty two seventy from my four-year career

[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:18.720]

[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.940]
we believe do we believe no no oh he oh I see me two dollars and twenty cents in quarters or I

[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:32.760]
thought he meant two hundred and twenty coins so let's see two thousand twenty cents that's four

[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.280]
eight that's not bad how do you get the twenty cents out of a quarter five six seven oh five

[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.660]
sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line so when are we getting back to a mayor pingo

[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:50.240]
they'd mayor orders police to scrap spare guns this is only after CBS once again humiliated and

[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:55.120]
degraded and embarrassed him and show what a jackass in little twirpy is a national television by

[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.140]
the way my me date county mayor Alex pingo has ordered that surplus county police weapons

[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:06.760]
be reduced to scrap metal following a CBS news report that found despite good intentions

[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:13.020]
that some officers guns ended up in the hands of criminals the news report is a particular

[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:17.440]
embarrassment for my me date which has sued the gun industry because of the cost of local gun

[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.360]
related crime so I guess the philosophy is well let's just ship the crime someplace else nice

[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:27.880]
go in air mayor the network's three month investigation discovered that four my me date police

[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:32.660]
weapons were connected to crimes in Chicago including one attempted murder case in which

[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:38.900]
a maintenance worker was shot three times after being mistaken for a gang member CBS also found

[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.460]
that despite a my me date county policy that used weapons that used weapons be kept within

[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.320]
law enforcement community the guns often turn up in shops where they could be bought by the public

[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:53.860]
said CBS correspondent Vince Gonzalez panelists an advocate of gun control who spearheaded the

[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:58.220]
counties lawsuit to compel twice as manufactured to design safer weapons said he was disturbed by

[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:02.880]
the finding he was disturbed by the finding and the embarrassment of the national television

[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:09.500]
again right there on CBS and rather giving them that evil CBS I look quite frankly this underscores

[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:15.500]
the problem we have with gunning manufacturers in this country mayor pingo said last year date

[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:22.260]
tried to stop the exact practice that CBS uncovered did county hired keys for police

[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:26.180]
supply of Indian Indian and a binary sell 1200 guns others in law enforcement community

[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.740]
keys for one of the nation's largest gun dealers with the only company to respond to the counties

[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:35.360]
bid company owner duck he's who may help can average for comment to they said his business screen

[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:41.000]
all the buyers dates gun for date guns to comply with the policy but CBS traced the weapons

[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.100]
among the findings 250 ended up at a farm supply during Kentucky 40 went to lose police

[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:51.160]
supply in high alia which exported them to Costa Rica for we see all the consumers well you know

[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.600]
we don't care about those Costa Rica animals anyway let them lose their souls let them shoot each

[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:04.400]

[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:22.080]

you're absolutely right that's the only reason they have any control in any money is because

[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:18.260]
they always find skate coats they don't have any skate coats they'd all been out of business a

[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:22.600]
long time ago but they hide that under forgiveness and tolerance now only forgiveness

[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:26.060]
intolerance for each other the like Jimmy Swagger you know right when they are when they're

[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:30.780]
popular pants that would be for good and all that right right now I didn't mean to do it okay on

[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:37.140]
the other things you were talking about it this bitch writing with the the mayor which is space

[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:43.680]
this skinny kid pina yeah that's it the the concert last Saturday and all these clowns

[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:51.580]

don't care don't speak yeah but we it was amazingly for the first time every yesterday we had a

[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:12.640]
whole bunch of people who did yes you did call it was great but the people the people who don't talk

[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:19.720]
who don't put down their leaders are the ones who elected these clowns into the city how do you

[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.220]
know how they make you think that they voted the only people who vote in date carrier those old

old Cubans did all the other ones elect the crazy Cubans right they're running a spam county that's

[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:34.260]
and that's and and when people finally wake up and realize that maybe we'll get some leadership

[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:39.580]
this can not believe that you're dreaming you must you know be on the funny jungle Jews this

[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:43.200]

we will never live long enough to see that happen I agree 100% with you sir and something

[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:56.780]
one equation was left out the discussion was the mayor of Miami Corolla who is probably a pretty

[00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:02.360]
good mayor but he came out what makes you say that it appears to be he's better than for us right

[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:09.100]
he's not as proud as I wouldn't say he's a good mayor or a hard ass nut has uh but he came out

[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:15.440]
against this concert strictly for political reasons yeah well well why would any why would anybody

[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:21.840]
come out against this for any other reason well what's the other reason okay you win have a great day

[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:27.480]
yeah yeah mayor carroyo he's too busy trying to get baseball in Miami that's what he wants

[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:33.820]

[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:57.620]
heraldous morning by Tyler Bridges Brad Bennett and Peter Horrisky underlying the whore part

mayor Jim Nogga leposes the new Riverside that team owner John Henry looked at in for Lauderdale

[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:09.020]
but nevertheless mayor carroyo he's all for it in Dave County that's right he's all for it

[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:20.860]
down to advice in tenio park this is in a city where they're goddamn bankrupt where they don't have

[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:24.880]
money to build a four hundred million or three hundred million dollar stadium for a billionaire

[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:29.360]
is that going to happen no you can take it to the bank mayor carroyo it isn't going to happen

[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.740]
better than the nuts yeah better than the nuts it's not going to happen all right never going to happen

[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:39.300]
and by the way how's you know I hear now on the hank show yesterday pat riley is getting on his

[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:43.820]
hand and he's incrying trying to sell tickets oh won't you please buy some tickets to the heat

[00:35:53.100 --> 00:36:00.400]
commercials there falling like a little child come on want somebody please fill up those seats only

[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.820]
eight bucks not a dollar a hour will pay you to you know put your ass in the seat no thank you

[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:11.520]
so let's build a baseball stadium down there in a city that's goddamn bankrupt where the education

[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.900]
is a joke in a county where they just got through with this whole series around gone channel four

[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.260]
news which you know it's like everything else all these exposés you see it for a couple of days

[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.900]
and then it goes away and that's the end of it like the goddamn prostitution ring down

[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.820]
the red candle that they keep telling us oh there's an internal investigation you just wait we're

[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:33.240]
waiting how long ago was that about a hundred years ago that that went on and we still haven't

[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:38.520]
heard another guy damn word about it in fact we got the second prostitution ring that they uncovered

[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:44.300]
a couple of days ago and we haven't heard anymore about that so when you talk about the attention

[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:49.840]
span of the American public being short even my penis isn't that short it's unbelievable

[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.420]
for about two minutes they get all worked up about something oh gee isn't this terrible the kids

[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:59.520]
can't even have a lunch and kids are getting killed trying to leave the campus and there's no textbooks

[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.080]
and all this other stuff nobody really cares because if they cared you better believe they'd be

[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:09.180]
doing something about it see what we have is people riding and protesting and acting like barbarians

[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:13.680]
because they don't like a rock group that came into play a concert because they're commonistas

[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:19.340]
then you get a bunch of wild people acting crazy out there by the arena

[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:25.200]
but when somebody tells them that their kids aren't getting the goddamn lunch break every day

[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.700]
or any food in the cafeteria or that they don't have any textbooks to bring home

[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:32.700]
ah what the hell with that what's that got to do with cash exactly what's that got to do with

[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:38.540]
commonista commonista plus the education system are a bunch of commonistas anyway but you're homos

[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.420]

Hebrew station in the middle of the north pole with a 20 share yeah how can you do that

[00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:01.820]

[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:48.860]
of thing that gets uh them all motivated in the psychotic right important stuff they can't be bothered

[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:53.420]
with that lost man man right they had to call it from park a wild one a few minutes ago and i

enjoy a free vacation but it was terrible i can the only the only place there was any

[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:27.460]
any bloody with six or more people in there was like the bill of jackayman monday night in a bar

[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:31.560]
let me tell you this i always laugh at people because so many of the people that are very

[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.920]
perroker and they don't know i mean granted you got a free thing but so next the key

[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:40.560]
kept keva and marco island if you talk to a lot of people here in south Florida that's right

[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:45.140]
those are three of the places they love going for a big keep her weekend get away for what what

[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:48.900]
what is the point there's nothing that is the point if you want to go to a place where it's totally

[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:52.380]
dead and there's a lot of old people just come to sunrise you don't have to go all the way over there

[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:57.740]
i think that uh... the switch gears totally here on the way home last i have a short drive home from work

[00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:03.360]
and uh... i was just cruising the down i've got the panther game and i had never listened to i mean

[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:07.800]
just never listened to panther's games just because of the broadcast to Chris Moore

[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:13.840]
i turned on last night and i mean there was actually some life yeah action and some activity going

[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:17.820]
on and you know with the broadcast i mean jigsman i remember jigs that i was a dog was a big

[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.160]
i understand before i moved down here and that's the last time i was really in target i don't

[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:26.320]
follow it enough to know who's good who's i know who's bad because the christ moron you you turn

[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:30.060]
on the game and you hear like you hear the skates on the ice right here the murmur

[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:33.540]

[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:42.920]
right pocket after six and uh... i mean i'm like it's just to have some action some something going on

[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:47.600]
he was the worst excuse for a sportscaster in the history of radio he was really really bad and

[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.540]
there are actually people when it was determined that he wasn't coming back we're calling up and

[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:54.140]
saying oh we'll miss him he didn't really have there were kiss and his ass and again you got to

[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:58.840]
understand because he was here okay he got kicked out of juries because even up there the devil

[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:03.100]
fan as as few of them as there are they couldn't put up with it he came down here because these people

[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:07.140]

[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:11.180]
funny he was supposed to have one i don't know how we know whether or not jigs is good or bad i mean

[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:16.980]
he's no well he's a big improvement now with yesterday in closing here the probably the

[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:21.620]
tackiest thing i ever heard was one one tank went to his like ten or twelve minute break i slipped

[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:26.100]
around went to seventeen hundred yeah that's when i heard that will chamberland died right so there's

[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:31.900]

years talking to a lot of dead people got a few live ones out there a couple of live wires one or two

[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:40.020]

[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:43.540]
thousand here a couple thousand there what's what's the big deal and you wonder why he died at 63

[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:48.060]
maybe he was kind of like drained of energy you ever think that was possible just a little bit

[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:53.060]
uh-huh drained at that point leased it in the waist any time i'll pay to that nine minutes after

[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:52.280]
burn made the print and press oh my god here's Miami hello morning Neil yes sir

[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:57.880]
since many of your callers prefer their comments by stating their hyphenated heritage let me

[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:03.440]
say that i'm a Cuban Cuban uh-huh i wanted to comment on the uh-infident of the van van that we had

[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:07.680]
here uh-but before that i wanted to say that i distributed with you yesterday uh-you said that

[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:13.000]
Lucristi couldn't sing a lick and uh-he was one of the best Paul said i love Lucristi uh-you

[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.700]
actually think he could sing well compare him to uh-smokey Robinson the lead singer of the majors

[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:25.120]
the diamonds or the Ricky Martin yeah yeah that's better all the time anyway what i was going to

[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:30.840]
say is that i agree that if you don't want to see a show by just not showing up you can vote with

[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:35.540]
your feet so you don't have to go out there and make a spectacle of yourself uh-but there are two

[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:40.580]
sides to this coin and uh-you gotta realize that in a place like Cuba where there is a dictatorship

[00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:45.400]
you don't start and become popular night to 69 and 30 years later you're still on the top

[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:49.660]
unless you're part of the system you're part of the machinery i think the members of the

[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:55.480]
administrative interior there and uh-castor had to know quite well that if he brought them here that

[00:56:55.480 --> 00:57:01.400]
this being the backyard of uh-the Cuban exiled that they would cross a rocket and uh-would

[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:05.860]
give this place a black eye uh-huh so i think it was a manipulated political situation

[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:09.120]
well how come they went to all these other places they've been all over North America

[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:13.300]
oh no i agree uh-they've been to New York they've been to California they've been around

[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.160]
there were in Toronto they've been they have a small Cuban community up there they didn't have any

[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:23.620]
riots or any protests oh well no no i agree but he knew that if he did that here that uh-the stations

[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:28.920]
and uh-the people that here we've got to riled up about their presence and uh-and obviously

[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:32.080]
those people can go on the air and say you don't-so in other words in some other words the junior

[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:36.380]
pan-and games and the senior pan-and games the reason that they have those games is so they give

[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:41.280]
Castro a vehicle to same Cuban athletes here in the Pissol see i-and i mean what you're saying on

[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:45.240]
the face of it is ridiculous because there are artists and there are sporting events and there

[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:49.400]
all sorts of other things that happen all over the country without any of the scissoria well

[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:52.760]
they're just like the people that ran a slumped all the way from here up to Baltimore to protest

[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:57.080]
when the Cuban national team was playing a baseball game up there well don't you think that he could

[00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:02.100]
have uh-a forecasted uh-uh these feet-tops of this and it's occurring here of course

[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.640]
so that these people are as predictable as the weather he's loving every minute of it

[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:09.620]
hey you see if they were smart which they're not if they were smart they would turn the other

[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:13.540]
cheek they would ignore it they wouldn't get too many publicity they wouldn't be coming back in

[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:17.660]
December and nobody would care he wouldn't have another great PR event but they just keep making them

[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:21.720]
look better and better and better given the more public relations and keep giving a black

[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:26.140]
eye to this community because there was predictable as the weather in uh-and hell and it also puts

[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:31.580]
more money for those Castro's pockets right you're right thank you okay yeah i mean uh-you know

[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:36.800]
give it a rest already just for once forget about it put it aside go uh-you know go to the

[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:40.940]
cockfights do something more constructive go play pinakal go play in dominoe park

[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:47.980]
but of course most of it lies with these Spanish language radio stations that they only exist

[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:52.640]
because they constantly are whipping these people up into a frenzy pandering to their worth

[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:57.060]
hatred and hysteria over and over again they're the ones that keep bringing these people out

[00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:02.020]
just like they did back when a coast guard episode happened getting on here and encouraging people

[01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:38.050]

[01:07:38.050 --> 01:07:38.050]

[01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:40.290]

[01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:52.610]
starting in and out of very very dangerous places

[01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:55.910]
you know this whole hell thing when you start when you come right now to it

[01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:57.590]
see the devil didn't invent hell

[01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:00.030]
god invented hell

[01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:03.770]
every time something bad happened or somebody does something

[01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:06.650]
aberrant oh the devil made me do it i'm possessed

[01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:10.110]
get the exorcist get father marina out of the closet

[01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:15.030]
but the the devil's not the one who invented hell

[01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:19.890]
where your soul burns in torture and gets tortured eternally

[01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:22.390]
that was that the devil of loving god

[01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:24.170]
that invented hell

[01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:28.990]
so that if by some bad stroke of luck you don't believe in these fairy tales

[01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:31.670]
you're going to burn in hell forever the only choices are heaven

[01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:35.090]
hell purgatory and then with chubby checkery do the limbo rock

[01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:39.910]
those are the only choices or just in that box in the ground

[01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:48.710]
what kind of sick and twisted minds what kind of intelligent person could

[01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:51.430]
possibly believe these things

[01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:58.010]
oh the lord god is a loving god but he's not and he's perfect but he's also jealous

[01:08:58.010 --> 01:09:01.490]
so you won't have any other gods before he's jealous and his wrath waxes hot

[01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:04.010]
so he's angry he's got all of these human foibles

[01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:06.470]
isn't that a coincidence because man invented him

[01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:11.750]
man invented god in their own image oh now we're getting it yes the other way around it yeah

[01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:16.430]
we invented a god who was just like them imperfect

[01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:24.250]
heaven and hell isn't that a great prospect oh yeah your soul is going to

[01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:27.410]
of course it doesn't look like I told you before it was making a difference because you have no

[01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:32.530]
senses you have no brain you have no body i ain't got no body so you have no senses

[01:09:32.530 --> 01:09:37.690]
she won't feel it anyway all you feel it it burns is that what it does does it burn

[01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:43.170]
that's what Linda said it burns she also said

[01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:49.310]
the miss go miss go miss yeah she said that too everybody be nailed to a chair and walk the

[01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:52.910]
excesses okay the cat look church won't like it too much but you'll love it especially that

read that on the air yeah uh i just moved down from New York grew up in south florida and i mean

[01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:17.830]
don't take this the wrong way but i don't understand if the way you feel about south florida is

[01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:24.290]
uh you know that's a terrible place it is it's a toy and just you know what i mean you've made a

[01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:29.510]
pretty good uh living um you know you don't pretty well for yourself living down here and being

[01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:35.370]
on the radio and making plenty of money yeah that uh what do you say because what you just said it

[01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:42.710]
i mean i know but you despised it so much yeah and i only got two years uh eleven months and a few days

[01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:50.170]
to go not that i'm counting well i mean then you the your audience is mostly you know is made up of

[01:10:51.150 --> 01:10:58.010]
you know by and large moron and what makes it better than your show the colors you're talking about

[01:10:58.010 --> 01:11:02.730]
the colors that's like one percent of the audience yeah you think the colors are in fact if you

[01:11:02.730 --> 01:11:07.950]
were listing then why you know that's all more what is it half of them can't speak English yeah oh i

[01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:15.250]
you know or use it grammatically correct yeah in and and what about you why do you listen to the show then

[01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:23.030]
i find you uh interesting uh i uh that's what's the problem what is the problem i just don't think you should

[01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:27.930]
you know really so in other words you know in other words you're going to tell me what to say you see

[01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:32.610]
one of the reasons people do listen to this show is because i call them the way i see them i would

[01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:37.630]
love for this town to be a wonderful place and a great place to live and a fun place once upon a time

[01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:42.330]
it wasn't so bad but you know something and it's gotten worse and worse and more dangerous and

[01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:47.730]
crime-ridden and more illegal alien and festive this is not a pleasant place to live i know but

[01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:52.690]
it's like you you know you've had a successful career down here so what does that have to do with it

[01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:58.550]
it has a lot to do with it hasn't got a lot to do with it what if you don't like it please i will

[01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:03.990]
and three years of the month and seven i think or stand on the way yeah i mean you talk so

[01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:08.850]
highly of those places yeah you know it's right in one and someday when i can afford it i will live

[01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:14.030]
in one of those places that's right yeah i just find it kind of hit a critical it's not

[01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:18.350]
hypocritical at all it's an exactly we have a reflection of the way i feel about it but since you

[01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:35.890]
it's not hypocritical to tell the truth of the way you feel this is not a pleasant place to live

[01:12:35.890 --> 01:12:39.470]
for living and breathing people to place for dead people it's a place for people over the age of

tonight pregame a lot of calls about that the popl briska melon be last night right no nothing about that

[01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:10.210]
you know this last guy if i had a dollar for every caller i've had like this over the 23 years i

[01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:15.250]
wouldn't be here right now i could retire and go someplace great well i'm listening because i find

[01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:20.630]
you very interesting but uh can't you say this and can't you say that instead of what you say uh

[01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:25.810]
no no i'm gonna see there's nothing worse than somebody try to tell somebody else what to say

[01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:30.090]
i like your show but i would like you better if you would just say things that i would

[01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:33.750]
uh rather here well guess what the answer is still no no

[01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:41.490]
what a jerk in other words because i've been successful here because i've bring something to the

[01:16:41.490 --> 01:16:45.170]
table and have been able to move from one station to another and get this big audience and bring

[01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:48.130]
a lot of revenue and make a lot of money for these people that you know i'll give you another

[01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:55.010]
example that would add give me even a much more specific example in the generality of an area

[01:16:55.010 --> 01:17:01.750]
and that's this radio station they're paying me a lot of money so why not you know why doesn't

[01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:05.330]
somebody call say oh you're always complaining and they're incompetent and they're stupid and they're

[01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:09.430]
making you look foolish with this oh jeb that's correct just because they're paying me a lot of

[01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:13.230]
money doesn't mean i'm gonna tell you great things about this company because they'd be i would be

[01:17:13.230 --> 01:17:19.230]
lying they're embarrassing they're humiliating their whole mentality the whole way of doing

[01:17:19.230 --> 01:17:23.690]
business is something i've never even dreamed of much less seen in a hundred years in a business

[01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:27.550]
so this because they're paying me a lot of money doesn't mean i'm gonna sit or they'd

[01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:31.190]
suck their ass and tell you how great the art's not my style

[01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:37.230]
and that's one of the reasons that this guy finds me interesting because i don't just sit here and

[01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:42.890]
kiss ass like most people let you come across okay no matter who's ass it is well it all depends

[01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:51.970]
how's Miguel doing today oh yeah can't you just say I mean you know i like you but

[01:17:51.970 --> 01:17:57.310]
but i'd like it so much better well too bad because the answer is still no no matter how many times

[01:17:57.310 --> 01:18:02.670]
you ask the same question the answer will still be no sure i would like it if this time was more

[01:18:02.670 --> 01:18:08.090]
like it was when i first came here wasn't that bad back then it was almost livable there were some

[01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:14.090]
signs of life some living and breathing people and if you if i'm inaccurate by telling you

[01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:18.530]
that this is basically a bunch of old parts who want to stifle everybody else and a bunch of

[01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:24.810]
and animal people then you tell me where i'm wrong i'd like to know what's wrong about that is

[01:18:24.810 --> 01:18:29.270]
that an inaccurate assessment am i making up these things about what happened for the eight

[01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:32.970]
million time at the arena the other night and about oh j and all the other same trash coming

[01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:37.790]
back here over and over again am i in about the politicians trying to force more taxes over on

[01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:42.590]
public for the wrong pet project so they get their palm greased am i making those things up no i

[01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:48.950]
don't think so so if you're looking for some guy that's just going to sugar coal life and just go

[01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:53.150]
along with a program here you're out you're under wrong spot on the dial pal i'm not going to do it

[01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:58.810]
here's pepper pine hello and you know how you doing okay sir oh i saw something

[01:18:58.810 --> 01:19:03.490]
sticking on tv last night and i had to give you a call i was watching hardball with uh christmas

[01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:06.950]
he was mark hardball and he was interviewing that little nerd uh gary bauer

[01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:11.830]
they were they were talking i'm sorry i just uh make a gutter old driven so

[01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:15.650]
just that's what i did too when i um um they were talking about the adventure interview of course

[01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:19.070]
this is like you know the chance for all the other guys to get on and bash him now but then he

[01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:23.550]
was asking he was asking bauer about his uh is comment about religion being for weak mind

[01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:27.270]
of people and he said this is a part that was sick and he said yeah i don't think they're all

[01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:31.650]
weak minded he said as a matter of fact he said i think back to that girl a column by Cassie

[01:19:31.650 --> 01:19:37.590]
Bernal he said she chose to die rather than renounce her fate he said if i had to be stuck in a fox

[01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:42.050]
hole i'd rather be with Cassie Bernal then just these a big adventurer those are his exact words

[01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:48.230]
mm-hmm what an asshole i guess what she's in a box in the ground though she chose to die new yeah sure

[01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:53.510]
she said all die she raised her hand yeah well she believed in god but god as usual was absent when

[01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:56.870]
needed yeah he wasn't there i don't know it never seemed to be in the right place at the right time

[01:19:56.870 --> 01:20:00.950]
he's always busy like i said bidding on ball games that's why all the athletes keep praying to him

[01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:05.170]
you know can i get a shame it's across maybe man is saying okay have a great day see you

[01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:11.070]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line yeah you can be a guy

[01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:14.810]
like Jesse Ventura especially a man who's in a public forum who's governor of a state that

[01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:19.470]
actually we can find on the map some of us who's got the balls to say these things in public

[01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:23.210]
and refuses to backtrack and then uh you know then you see what a real man is all about

[01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:29.750]
as opposed to people in like 99 percent 99 and 9 10 percent of the media who just pander and say

[01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:34.810]
all the politically correct things because god forbid they might offend somebody i'm going to tell

[01:20:34.810 --> 01:20:38.570]
you when you got a public forum and you're speaking on a regular basis and you're not offending

[01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:44.250]

just to be pride the sinners from the uh the wonderment of going to heaven and having eternal life

[01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:26.510]

in western hello yes ma'am i knew hi how are you great i am a baseball fan a marlin fan and a huge

[01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:54.230]
joe angel fan right and are you familiar with the article that was out in the paper about a

[01:32:54.230 --> 01:33:00.590]
month ago regarding davel bion yeah the beri jackass call a rice uh well according to the real

[01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:06.390]
terms in the area of western joe angel's house is for sale sure when on the market two days after

[01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:12.310]
these season ended right so there must be some truth to the article oh he's not coming back

[01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:17.890]
joe angel's not coming back no is that for sure positive he's not coming back this year this

[01:33:18.490 --> 01:33:22.110]
right or you're right another year less than the con right but he won't be coming back i'm sure

[01:33:22.110 --> 01:33:26.530]
they're going to pay him on well i really stuck i agree i think he did a fine job in that you know

[01:33:26.530 --> 01:33:30.310]
i i don't like uh some of the aspects of what he does he does a little too much of that john miller

[01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:34.930]
stuff but i think he did a really excellent job especially under impossible circumstances he's

[01:33:34.930 --> 01:33:39.750]
last two years trying to uh you know brought and make excitement out of that and uh the way that

[01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:43.490]
away and then all goes back by the way and i have this on absolute authority it all goes back to

[01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:47.490]
john henry he was the one who made the decision he's the one who leaked the information to beri jack

[01:33:47.490 --> 01:33:53.130]
s before the season ended and uh totally unacceptable what an ugly way to do it right i mean i have a

[01:33:53.130 --> 01:33:57.270]
lot of respect what a nice way to repay a guy who did a good job for you absolutely absolutely

[01:33:57.270 --> 01:34:01.070]
i have a lot of respect for john jolian and none for henry and why couldn't they have divvied it up

[01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:04.590]
why couldn't they have let the each guy they both do a real good job why couldn't they let they

[01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:08.410]
have a brine do half of the game on radio and half on tv and the same with joe angel why couldn't

[01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:13.690]
they do that instead of pissed off joe angel and the shipping amount absolutely i think it sucks

[01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:17.330]
well i think he'll be better off for it yeah i think maybe you'll go somewhere where the team that

[01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:21.510]
doesn't lose a hundred games let's help though okay all right thank you we're close to it oh they didn't

[01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:28.130]
lose a hundred games you don't know the only 98 i think yeah typical lacking of class baby that's

[01:34:28.130 --> 01:34:32.850]
old john henry standing up there in the stands looking for fans i must be crazy i must be not running

[01:34:32.850 --> 01:34:36.770]

spare some change mister no i don't think so well how did i stay anyway that's john henry

[01:34:43.130 --> 01:34:46.690]

[01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:23.810]

[01:42:44.230 --> 01:42:49.370]

case then that guy can come in and do the show tomorrow and i'll just take the money thank you

[01:42:54.730 --> 01:42:59.150]
oh world palm beach is back hello yes Neil yes sir sorry about that you know i know

[01:42:59.150 --> 01:43:03.390]
i'm sorry i guess i am your only caller because when i do call i do say we're all palm because

[01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:08.870]
we usually on exclusive you know anyway you know my wife and i have been married 11 years and

[01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:14.310]
we have a daughter a young daughter yes sir and recently she came to me and said she wants to

[01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:21.630]
start attending church so i'm an atheist and we pretty much never really spoke spoke much about

[01:43:21.630 --> 01:43:26.730]
the religion in any way but she feels it might be a good solid foundation for the orderly to learn

[01:43:26.730 --> 01:43:32.390]
a history of religion so here is my dilemma i'm just you know i think there are a lot of good books

[01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:37.470]
you know how old is your daughter he's eight eight now my mother law has taken her to like a

[01:43:37.470 --> 01:43:42.810]
Sunday school when she stayed down there and she's beginning to enjoy it and because you know

[01:43:42.810 --> 01:43:47.970]
the Sunday school of course is you know getting the coloring and you know a bunch of fun stuff

[01:43:47.970 --> 01:43:52.770]
but overall here she is that she says well maybe it's time to do that so you know i pretty much

[01:43:52.770 --> 01:43:58.290]
didn't say yes or no though but my feelings are that are the same as you and most of the other call

[01:43:58.290 --> 01:44:01.670]
yeah what i would do is i would wait until she's maybe a little bit older and then get her some great

[01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:05.330]
books on comparative religions of the world and let her pick her own poison or not as the case

[01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:09.690]
may be as opposed to getting brainwashed and indoctrinated which is what they do in Sunday school

[01:44:09.690 --> 01:44:17.950]
right because i'm a very fair father and uh it's fun husband too and i and i don't want to step

[01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:22.730]
our forefathers it's our fair fathers yeah right so uh just call it you know that uh my

[01:44:22.730 --> 01:44:26.830]
private advice pal don't do it don't don't sacrifice her brain to the a religion is please

[01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:32.070]
right he's probably probably plenty of fathers out there in husbands it probably have to go through

[01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:35.590]
the same thing here and pretty much just back off probably just to watch football as

[01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:39.050]
only while they're gone again right that's the bottom line which is not a good idea affects you

[01:44:39.050 --> 01:44:43.470]
let's throw the football a lot more and uh and then before i go uh since there is a uh

[01:44:43.470 --> 01:44:48.070]
possible stop storm threat uh this weekend in south florida i'm up you know about that or not

[01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:52.370]
sure and uh i say these protests should get on that wrap it start heading back before storm

[01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:57.890]
it okay anyway thank you to me ill see you okay he redeemed himself there and of course nobody

[01:44:57.890 --> 01:45:01.990]
is still told us about the why god invented hill i think that's a very important question leave

[01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:05.390]
it to me to come up with the questions i don't claim to have all the answers you religious started

[01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:12.170]
one and have all the answers worth the answer it's almost 12 30 already half an hour goes by and

[01:45:12.170 --> 01:45:17.670]
we still haven't found out why god created hell probably the same reason he doesn't get rid of lucifer

[01:45:17.670 --> 01:45:25.670]
you know lucifer you know lucifer reminds me of oj yeah he's evil he's pesky and he just refuses

[01:45:25.670 --> 01:45:30.990]
to go away but god being all powerful he can just snap his fingers or whatever he's

[01:45:30.990 --> 01:45:36.230]
testicles his tentacles whatever he's got and there goes lucifer never see him again oh my gosh

[01:45:36.230 --> 01:45:41.550]
can you imagine how wonderful it would be no more shootings in calorato no more shootings on the

[01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:45.890]
streets of Miami no more people throwing their babies off the banister no more this crap

[01:45:48.730 --> 01:45:55.790]
no more evil because if satan is responsible for all the evil things in the world and for leading man

[01:45:55.790 --> 01:46:01.830]
down the path to hell all we got to do is get rid of him so god must be playing some kind of

[01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:06.190]
game with us especially since he knew ahead of time how it's all gonna come out anyway

[01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:12.890]
he knew ahead of time how it was gonna come out just like when he put adam and he to the test in

[01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:17.530]
the garden oh they gave him free he gave him free well the only problem is he knew what the

[01:46:17.530 --> 01:46:22.030]
resolution was gonna be anyway and what the choice would be he already knew that

[01:46:24.530 --> 01:46:30.970]
so it's an SNN game it's kind of like here at curiom i'm gonna give you a whole bunch of ways to

[01:46:30.970 --> 01:46:37.610]
fail that's what i'm gonna do and if you can still succeed well why you must be fantastic

[01:46:38.450 --> 01:46:42.230]
but what i'm really gonna do is keep throwing hoops in front of him i'm gonna throw a rings of

[01:46:42.230 --> 01:46:46.810]
fire and i'm gonna throw a locus everything in your way to see if i can't make you fail just like

[01:46:46.810 --> 01:46:55.310]
they do here at curiom maybe we've seen the face of god George maybe it's Greg Reed yeah going

[01:46:56.070 --> 01:47:01.810]
like that maybe we need maybe all this place needs is a good exorcism

[01:47:09.710 --> 01:47:14.590]
how we're getting there we've seen the face of god it's Greg Reed so who's Satan

[01:47:15.810 --> 01:47:20.230]
i don't know but he's your talks like Linda Blair

[01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:27.050]
here here's a mobile and west pond beach hello yeah no yes sir how you doing okay

[01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:33.530]
hey i know why no i get you squats in the living room rug like Linda Blair too anyway go ahead sir

[01:47:33.530 --> 01:47:39.830]
okay i wanted to call you a long time ago but i get that die epic do you do you remember when you

[01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:44.230]
came back from when you were one of your vacations yes sir you were talking about how you was

[01:47:44.230 --> 01:47:48.810]
getting on the 836 and you kind of like blacked out and you didn't wake up until right that's

[01:47:48.810 --> 01:47:54.990]
i didn't lie but i was just uh i don't know what it was i had like a gap i can tell it by all right you

[01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:59.270]
should have crashed and burned right by all right you something should have happened right no i

[01:47:59.270 --> 01:48:03.790]
wouldn't say that no on a law of averages if you do i mean if your mind goes blank and you kind of

[01:48:03.790 --> 01:48:09.210]
forget your own mind when blank i just uh my attention span or whatever i just wasn't paying any

[01:48:09.210 --> 01:48:13.950]
attention okay under those are you suggesting that god was the one that got me home safely is that it

[01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:19.750]
yes he carried you home the whole world oh i see but why would you do that when i don't even believe

[01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:24.390]
in him because he's giving you a chance for youtube believing in you uh huh and what about all those

[01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:27.510]
people who do believe in that he doesn't just straighten their ass out they fall asleep at the

[01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:35.010]
wheel and bang their dead how about them what was their time it was their time it was their time

[01:48:35.010 --> 01:48:39.170]
like those like those teenagers in Denver that got killed in the school it was their time to go

[01:48:39.870 --> 01:48:45.370]
exactly uh huh that's when he wanted he didn't want you right now or you didn't that yeah i'm

[01:48:45.370 --> 01:48:49.570]
telling you to tell you i don't want him either you should believe who invented health who invented

[01:48:49.570 --> 01:48:57.210]
hell sir i can't answer that okay thank you see there no answer the bible he's giving me a

[01:48:57.210 --> 01:49:00.750]
bunch of doubles hawk he's the sounds like one of those NRA guys but all of it was just in fourth

[01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:03.790]
existing love you know with the same old tired rhetoric that they're reading off a god damn

[01:49:03.790 --> 01:49:08.770]
newspaper they find in the tea room somewhere off a piece of a piece of literature same craft

[01:49:09.890 --> 01:49:14.970]
the lord guided me home oh thank you god thank you god

[01:49:18.250 --> 01:49:22.010]
26 past noon at 560 wqa m

[01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:28.150]
oh that the lord even loves neo-rodgers so you're a atheist uh completely rooted in science so

[01:49:28.150 --> 01:49:33.810]
with no belief so side of what you can see with your own two eyes well then chances are that

[01:49:33.810 --> 01:49:38.350]
the old testament didn't do it for you and neither did it you uh so with the lord's final

[01:49:38.350 --> 01:49:44.870]
attempt to bring your sorry ass around check out the latest book from god entitled screw you to

[01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:50.750]
you ungrateful little bastard start off in chapter one with who do you think caused a flood that

[01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:56.830]
wiped out your house last week uh then move on to such later chapters as step off side i'd dare you

[01:49:56.830 --> 01:50:03.170]
and drop to your knees and pray or those hemorrhoids won't ever go away it's screw you to

[01:50:03.170 --> 01:50:09.670]
you ungrateful little bastard the latest release from god it's better than the book of Mormon

[01:50:09.670 --> 01:50:18.190]
better than the Torah and the Bible combined by yours today it's property one at 560 wqa so there

[01:50:18.190 --> 01:50:22.490]
isn't god because the panthers have recalled right when you found novoselta from uh luahville

[01:50:23.110 --> 01:50:27.510]
because obviously with melan b hurt last night and with vera would add groin he's pulling it

five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eighteen t line uh as we continue looking for the

[01:50:46.230 --> 01:50:50.270]
reason for hell why did god and vent hell sounds like a very reasonable question to me

[01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:55.650]
i asked a guy to question he said yeah he's got all the other answers but when i ask him

[01:50:55.650 --> 01:51:00.850]
something very basic why would anybody why would any uh loving creator invent something as grotesque

[01:51:00.850 --> 01:51:08.510]
and horrendous and disgusting as hate as hell as this lake of fire as this towering inferno the answer is

[01:51:08.510 --> 01:51:16.050]
i don't know well think about it okay here's the mobile in halloweddale hello

[01:53:11.770 --> 01:53:16.290]

uh robin Williams okay as a part in that movie where uh cuban did in jimmy says that hell is

[01:55:31.710 --> 01:55:39.410]
probably not an actual place but hell is is a result of a person's life gone bad god did not create

[01:55:39.410 --> 01:55:45.570]
hell there's nothing like it only human beings have done it and and i'm ten i go to church almost

[01:55:45.570 --> 01:55:52.870]
you know as as often as i can but you know we we've been so indoctrinated as she as you call it a

[01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:58.250]
lot and and there's just a lot of misleading things that are being said in the church today that

[01:55:58.250 --> 01:56:04.290]
that is kind of ridiculous what what what happens in columbine is not is not a result of of

why i always created okay okay first of all i think that hell was created by the church a long time ago

[02:05:14.730 --> 02:05:20.170]
to civilize this uncivilized world a place where you would go if you were bad and so forth

[02:05:20.170 --> 02:05:25.910]
it sure worked real well didn't that exactly okay and my second thing is is that just in case

[02:05:43.730 --> 02:05:46.870]

[02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:51.090]

[02:14:51.070 --> 02:15:00.790]
uh help yes so that'd be good uh he created hell as a consequence from man's actions in other words

[02:15:01.290 --> 02:15:06.970]
i remember when i was in college if i drank too much it was great when i was getting high but the

[02:15:06.970 --> 02:15:11.070]
next morning i woke up with a hangover i thought to myself jeez i don't think i want to do that

[02:15:11.070 --> 02:15:19.410]
anymore um in a ten commandments you with me right i'm listening okay okay the ten commandments

[02:15:19.410 --> 02:15:24.810]
and more the i'm listening okay anyway the ten commandments what problem do you have with that

[02:15:24.810 --> 02:15:30.070]
is that is that not a bad um order is it to follow in life or not what about this will not

[02:15:30.070 --> 02:15:35.750]
commit adultery how many people are committing adultery um again that's what are the consequences

[02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:39.970]
to that action you're gonna ruin a marriage you're gonna ruin a family maybe you can do that but if

[02:15:39.970 --> 02:15:43.930]
you choose and didn't ruin well both chamberlain ever he was smart he never got married with twenty

[02:15:43.930 --> 02:15:51.630]
thousand yeah anyway most of you guys are jealous okay that right now anyway you know it's

[02:15:51.630 --> 02:15:56.010]
funny it's ironic the person like yourself very intelligent very bright guy very humorous guy

[02:15:56.010 --> 02:16:01.490]
that's using you i mean what you're doing god is using me to get what yes to make sure that other

[02:16:01.490 --> 02:16:06.190]
people open up their mind and realize how ridiculous the whole religion thing is and thank you god

[02:16:06.190 --> 02:16:10.790]
that's one way to put it that's one way to put it yeah but if all the topics you choose you know

[02:16:10.790 --> 02:16:15.890]
that people love the topic yeah and you know at some point yeah because they know that it's all a

[02:16:15.890 --> 02:16:19.690]
bunch of bullcrap that anybody with a half a brain that's using it and wants to free themselves

[02:16:19.690 --> 02:16:24.470]
from the brainwashing knows how silly it all is it's embarrassingly ridiculous well i think god

[02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:30.350]
invented held up so there's consequence for our actions yes yes and is that why the born

[02:16:30.350 --> 02:16:34.970]
again christians will tell you that if somebody like a Hitler would have accepted christ on his death

[02:16:34.970 --> 02:16:39.570]
bed that he would have gone to heaven look what we got out of that i was gonna say that's who's

[02:16:39.570 --> 02:16:44.550]
gonna say that's good you know to get into the politics politics i don't know forget about the

[02:16:44.550 --> 02:16:50.230]
politics of it we're talking morality you know good bad evil consequences of your evil what what

[02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:54.090]
kind of possible well what kind of possible incentive is there for there to be a good person

[02:16:54.090 --> 02:16:59.770]
if you can accept some kind of fairy tale and go to heaven who says that person accepts the fairy tale

[02:16:59.770 --> 02:17:04.710]
and goes to heaven if they're not that's what the born again christians tell us now i don't know i think

[02:17:04.710 --> 02:17:10.410]
that i think that's debatable and i have a problem with somebody who says that you know i'm a

[02:17:10.410 --> 02:17:15.050]
christian and i just killed six people and i yeah i know i'm going to heaven well there's only two

[02:17:15.050 --> 02:17:18.890]
people who know that the person that's saying that and god and god yeah and you and i are gonna sit

[02:17:18.890 --> 02:17:22.630]
back at judge who's right i don't know no we'll be in a boxes where we'll be sir when that day

[02:17:22.630 --> 02:17:26.330]
comes we'll be in the box we'll be the other than people but have a great day oh

[02:17:28.370 --> 02:17:33.050]
there has to be a consequence for actions don't you see the parallel between drinking too much and

[02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:38.470]
keeping the grunts out don't you see the parallel between that and burning in the eternal lake of

[02:17:38.470 --> 02:17:41.330]
fire because the lord is a god loving god

[02:17:44.590 --> 02:17:49.810]
and everything is evil man everything is wicked everything you like whether it's you know

[02:17:49.810 --> 02:17:55.930]
have it to go too many beers whether it's going out and getting laid everything that's good is evil

[02:17:55.930 --> 02:18:02.710]
and you're gonna burn in hell if you do it that's right the s and m god there has never been more

[02:18:02.710 --> 02:18:09.090]
s and m more twisted sick crap that in the evil book they call it the good book that you call it

[02:18:09.090 --> 02:18:12.770]
the bad book the bad book says a poly crap

[02:18:14.390 --> 02:18:20.130]
media is sick and the plot bad perhaps one of the most interesting words in the english language

[02:18:20.130 --> 02:18:26.430]
today is the word out of all of the english words that begin with a letter f

[02:18:26.430 --> 02:18:34.550]
is the only word that is referred to as the f word it's the one magical word just by its sound

[02:18:34.550 --> 02:18:42.350]
can describe pain pleasure hate and love as most words in the english language is derived from

[02:18:42.350 --> 02:18:49.770]
German the word flickend which means to strike in english falls into many grammatical categories

[02:18:49.770 --> 02:18:57.670]
as a transit of verb for instance john f*** surely its meaning is not always sexual it can be used

[02:18:57.670 --> 02:19:05.130]
as an adjective such as john's doing all the f***ing work as part of an adverb surely talks to

[02:19:05.130 --> 02:19:14.890]
f***ing much as an adverb enhancing an adjective surely is f***ing beautiful as a noun I don't give a

[02:19:14.890 --> 02:19:24.310]
f*** as part of a word absolute and loosely or in f***ing credible and as almost every word in a sentence

[02:19:24.310 --> 02:19:30.990]
f*** the f***ing f***ers as you must realize there aren't too many words with the versatility of

[02:19:30.990 --> 02:19:38.510]
f*** as in these examples describing situations such as fraud I got f***ed at the use carlock

[02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:48.610]
this may all f*** it trouble I guess I'm really f***ed now aggression don't f*** with me buddy

[02:19:50.130 --> 02:19:56.190]
dismissal why don't you go outside and play hide and go f*** yourself I'm sure you can think of

[02:19:56.190 --> 02:20:04.290]
many more examples say it loudly and proudly f*** you all right one fifteen at five sixty w two

[02:20:04.290 --> 02:20:08.610]
I'm so here's the word from my clearance pop albury will be evaluated before game time in Toronto

[02:27:12.090 --> 02:27:16.430]
that's how it pops my line what is it yeah yeah yeah I'm about the religion thing you know it works

[02:27:16.570 --> 02:27:21.570]
that guy that's good but you know it's like if you look back on the Greeks and had all the gods

[02:27:21.570 --> 02:27:25.170]
they had a god for everything oh yeah I know in fact the Greeks that was their favorite line was

[02:27:25.170 --> 02:27:29.530]
oh god that's good stick it in there again exactly and so we look back on that we actually

[02:27:29.530 --> 02:27:35.950]
study it in school now on what a forest that was yeah we're so big we call our god god right oh yeah

[02:27:35.950 --> 02:27:40.990]
every every you know culture that comes along their god is the right one there you know it's

[02:27:40.990 --> 02:27:45.370]
there only been about 45,000 gods throughout the ages and it's all a bunch of bull crab it's

[02:27:45.430 --> 02:27:50.670]
fairy tales exactly fairy tales like like Jesse Ventura says it's fun for the people minded it's

[02:27:50.670 --> 02:27:55.050]
fairy tales for weak people and if like I said to this guy if it does him some good if that's what he

[02:27:55.050 --> 02:28:00.010]
needs that crushed Alina fine just don't try to plunder off on anybody else and use it as excuse

[02:28:00.010 --> 02:28:05.030]
to condemn everybody else which obviously he doesn't right hey Jacko thank god bless him you know

[02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:10.130]
what I mean right yeah go have that and and you know another thing but I'll go have added because

[02:28:10.130 --> 02:28:14.830]
then he'll be really be in trouble and exactly it's just it's just crazy leave that to the

[02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:18.450]
sparsers like Will Chamberlain they were having and all the wars that have been fought on over this

[02:28:18.450 --> 02:28:23.210]
planet half of this over religion all more than that hey I would say religion or property

[02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:27.050]
or money one of the other way you know the thing in Pakistan where they had the military coup

[02:28:27.050 --> 02:28:31.470]

[02:28:31.470 --> 02:28:36.030]

So they go, yes, yes, by those buttons.

[02:34:15.530 --> 02:34:16.770]

[02:34:18.590 --> 02:34:18.910]
Yes, sir.

[02:34:19.130 --> 02:34:19.830]
Come on, who's that player?

[02:34:19.930 --> 02:34:20.890]
Who's ready to make see book?

[02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:21.450]
Okay, great.

[02:34:22.930 --> 02:34:23.910]
Here's Homestead, hello.

[02:34:24.610 --> 02:34:25.050]
Hey, Neil.

[02:34:25.230 --> 02:34:25.530]
Yes, sir.

[02:34:25.590 --> 02:34:25.850]
How you doing?

[02:34:26.530 --> 02:34:28.490]
Touching the blurry, speaking in tongues now.

[02:34:28.670 --> 02:34:28.890]
Yes.

[02:34:29.170 --> 02:34:29.670]
You got that right.

[02:34:29.970 --> 02:34:30.430]
What's your call?

[02:34:30.530 --> 02:34:32.350]
With the old J thing, you know what my call?

[02:34:32.350 --> 02:34:35.590]
This guy moves from California State to another state.

[02:34:36.030 --> 02:34:36.210]
Yeah.

[02:34:36.210 --> 02:34:39.430]
And he gets a job where he's earning X amount of dollars.

[02:34:39.530 --> 02:34:39.790]
Uh-huh.

[02:34:40.050 --> 02:34:40.910]
The state of California does that.

[02:34:40.910 --> 02:34:45.270]
Well, that's the reason that he wants to come to Florida because they don't have a reciprocal.

[02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:47.890]
There's something about the, the, they can't take his money.

[02:34:48.010 --> 02:34:48.390]
Right, right.

[02:34:48.530 --> 02:34:50.510]
It's like a catchpoint, too, where they can't garnish his wage.

[02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.790]
Right.

[02:34:50.970 --> 02:34:53.470]
So I think he's looking to open a knife shop over on 20 come to that.

[02:34:53.550 --> 02:34:54.170]
That's what I hear.

[02:34:54.590 --> 02:34:57.870]
And the other thing is he says it might not go, but he'll take a stab at it.

[02:34:57.870 --> 02:34:58.430]
Got that right.

[02:34:59.210 --> 02:35:03.350]
You think you got to make your sandwich by the way, to work as the clerk behind you.

[02:35:03.530 --> 02:35:04.170]
There you go.

[02:35:04.170 --> 02:35:06.430]
You think that place is bad to work for.

[02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:07.450]
I got two words for you.

[02:35:07.570 --> 02:35:07.870]
That's worse.

[02:35:08.650 --> 02:35:09.450]
American Airlines.

[02:35:09.810 --> 02:35:10.570]
Oh, yeah, I can imagine.

[02:35:10.730 --> 02:35:11.410]
Have a good one, man.

[02:35:11.430 --> 02:35:11.930]
Okay, thanks.

[02:35:11.930 --> 02:35:13.690]
And watch out for those damn my hand grenades.

[02:35:13.870 --> 02:35:14.390]
You got that right.

[02:35:14.430 --> 02:35:14.670]
Okay.

[02:35:17.450 --> 02:35:20.210]
Please roll your feet back from the door.

[02:35:20.810 --> 02:35:25.110]
If placed on your hand for days, give me overhead before it takes off.

[02:35:25.790 --> 02:35:26.470]
Thank you.

[02:35:28.170 --> 02:35:30.030]
Here's a mobile in West Palm Beach.

[02:35:30.170 --> 02:35:30.290]
Hello.

[02:35:30.930 --> 02:35:33.290]
Yeah, this has been a hockey question for you.

[02:35:33.290 --> 02:35:35.730]
I haven't heard any update on a Melan B in Buray.

[02:35:35.810 --> 02:35:37.870]
Well, I'll give you the latest as of a half hour ago.

[02:35:38.010 --> 02:35:39.470]
Buray is not as bad as we thought.

[02:35:39.610 --> 02:35:39.930]
Thank God.

[02:35:39.930 --> 02:35:42.550]
And he's going to be evaluated just before game time tonight.

[02:35:43.210 --> 02:35:45.690]
And Melan B had a concussion, but not a real bad one.

[02:35:45.790 --> 02:35:47.690]
And he's with the team in Toronto will not play tonight.

[02:35:48.050 --> 02:35:49.470]
But they'll take a look at him again tomorrow.

[02:35:49.630 --> 02:35:51.290]
So that's not as bad as we feared.

[02:35:52.650 --> 02:35:53.550]
Oh, that's good here.

[02:35:53.650 --> 02:35:55.250]
What do you think of the pants this so far this year?

[02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:56.170]
Well, I'm defeated.

[02:35:56.290 --> 02:35:57.290]
You can't do much better than that.

[02:35:57.330 --> 02:35:58.850]
It wasn't very exciting game last night.

[02:35:59.110 --> 02:36:02.250]
But you know, and then with the injuries, it was enough to tear your guts out.

[02:36:02.250 --> 02:36:03.910]
But what's not to like you?

[02:36:04.030 --> 02:36:05.650]
The whole question is can we keep them healthy?

[02:36:06.590 --> 02:36:07.070]
That's true.

[02:36:07.210 --> 02:36:08.170]
I'm fired up about the season.

[02:36:08.350 --> 02:36:08.850]
How are you? Thanks.

[02:36:08.890 --> 02:36:09.150]
All right.

[02:36:09.730 --> 02:36:10.830]
There is a Panther fan.

[02:36:10.850 --> 02:36:11.510]
How do you like that?

[02:36:11.730 --> 02:36:13.270]
Oh, the only problem with this.

[02:36:13.350 --> 02:36:14.450]
Oh, I see you got to shut it off.

[02:36:14.610 --> 02:36:16.250]
Oh, because he will not...

[02:36:18.750 --> 02:36:19.070]
Even...

[02:36:19.070 --> 02:36:19.210]
What?

[02:36:20.470 --> 02:36:23.590]
Even without passing the button sub-talks,

[02:36:24.470 --> 02:36:26.050]
passing parts all over the place.

[02:36:28.110 --> 02:36:28.830]
Here's the popular.

[02:36:29.030 --> 02:36:29.150]
Hello.

[02:36:29.150 --> 02:36:29.150]

[02:36:29.470 --> 02:36:29.670]
Hello.

[02:36:29.670 --> 02:36:29.910]
Hello.

[02:36:30.090 --> 02:36:30.190]
Hello.

[02:36:30.390 --> 02:36:30.830]
Yes, sir.

[02:36:31.090 --> 02:36:31.310]
Hello.

[02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:32.170]
We're in it.

[02:36:33.650 --> 02:36:34.030]
Okay.

[02:36:34.330 --> 02:36:34.970]
I'm listening, pal.

[02:36:35.110 --> 02:36:35.450]
Speak up.

[02:36:35.550 --> 02:36:35.890]
Speak up.

[02:36:36.130 --> 02:36:36.510]
Hello.

[02:36:36.950 --> 02:36:37.370]
We're in it.

[02:36:37.530 --> 02:36:37.710]
Okay.

[02:36:37.810 --> 02:36:38.030]
Thanks.

[02:36:38.790 --> 02:36:40.170]
As if we didn't already know that.

[02:36:41.250 --> 02:36:41.630]
56670560.

[02:36:41.850 --> 02:36:42.110]
Come on.

[02:36:42.250 --> 02:36:43.050]
Cut out what is crap.

[02:36:43.050 --> 02:36:43.910]
It's a vibrating.

[02:36:44.430 --> 02:36:45.090]
And pound five.

[02:36:45.170 --> 02:36:46.130]
It must be multipurpose.

[02:36:46.550 --> 02:36:48.730]
pound five 60 on the 1860 wireless line.

[02:36:49.230 --> 02:36:50.010]
Here's four Myers.

[02:36:50.170 --> 02:36:50.330]
Hello.

[02:36:50.750 --> 02:36:51.330]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:36:51.490 --> 02:36:51.830]
Yes, sir.

[02:36:51.970 --> 02:36:53.130]
You have a great show.

[02:36:53.210 --> 02:36:55.610]
But you don't have no advertising whatsoever in four Myers.

[02:36:55.610 --> 02:36:56.090]
Really?

[02:36:56.390 --> 02:36:56.610]
Yeah.

[02:36:56.710 --> 02:36:57.910]
I mean, I found your skill.

[02:36:57.910 --> 02:37:00.430]
Almost sent somebody a spare spot from over here to four Myers.

[02:37:00.710 --> 02:37:01.630]
I mean, and I'm paying...

[02:37:01.630 --> 02:37:03.510]
Thanks as you've got about 40 minutes of spots.

[02:37:03.610 --> 02:37:04.830]
You'll be having a ship over there today.

[02:37:05.130 --> 02:37:06.790]
I'm paying for this call from four Myers.

[02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:07.730]
And it's like a ridiculous car.

[02:37:07.730 --> 02:37:09.710]
Yeah, but the good news is that our...

[02:37:09.710 --> 02:37:12.530]
We've already ordered the 800 number and starting in just a few days ago.

[02:37:13.010 --> 02:37:13.810]
Oh, yeah.

[02:37:14.370 --> 02:37:14.950]
I heard that before.

[02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.470]
No, seriously.

[02:37:15.850 --> 02:37:18.250]
But listen, I called you because I was talking about...

[02:37:18.250 --> 02:37:19.390]
I was thinking about that...

[02:37:19.390 --> 02:37:20.430]
Hey, something you were talking about.

[02:37:20.550 --> 02:37:21.750]
And I was in a Navy for four years.

[02:37:21.930 --> 02:37:22.230]
Yes, sir.

[02:37:22.430 --> 02:37:24.470]
And like, when we had the cross international deadline,

[02:37:25.010 --> 02:37:28.570]
we had to do this thing called Wog Day, where they had like...

[02:37:28.570 --> 02:37:29.670]
They had guys...

[02:37:29.670 --> 02:37:30.630]
We had to walk around...

[02:37:30.630 --> 02:37:32.130]
If you've never had the craft before, you had to walk around

[02:37:32.130 --> 02:37:33.890]
or your underwear and had other guys beat you.

[02:37:34.410 --> 02:37:36.370]
And look over the side of the ship and while you're busy beating,

[02:37:36.450 --> 02:37:38.530]
you had to call for flipper and stuff like that.

[02:37:38.670 --> 02:37:39.130]
Oh, right.

[02:37:39.430 --> 02:37:42.610]
And then the top it off, we had this contest called the sea...

[02:37:42.610 --> 02:37:43.570]
The sea bitch contest.

[02:37:43.990 --> 02:37:44.270]
Yeah.

[02:37:44.730 --> 02:37:47.290]
And they had a guy from each division dressed up like a woman.

[02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:49.890]
And like, we were out to see for already like 50 days.

[02:37:50.090 --> 02:37:52.590]
So I mean, these guys already look like, you know, women to begin with.

[02:37:52.590 --> 02:37:53.570]
Oh, one hand.

[02:37:54.190 --> 02:37:54.390]
Oh.

[02:37:55.810 --> 02:37:57.230]
It's like, don't ask, don't tell.

[02:37:57.350 --> 02:38:00.090]
But I mean, they had like the real baby and they had...

[02:38:00.090 --> 02:38:01.970]
I got, you know, the biggest fatest guy in a ship.

[02:38:01.970 --> 02:38:04.650]
A lot of factory going on out there with those semen.

[02:38:04.830 --> 02:38:05.850]
No, no, no, no.

[02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:07.110]
I never went down on anything hard.

[02:38:07.710 --> 02:38:08.770]
You know, far and full of semen.

[02:38:09.830 --> 02:38:10.510]
What are you guys?

[02:38:10.630 --> 02:38:11.370]
We believe you.

[02:38:11.650 --> 02:38:11.910]
Okay.

[02:38:12.410 --> 02:38:12.890]
Have a great day.

[02:38:12.990 --> 02:38:13.410]
You two, baby.

[02:38:13.830 --> 02:38:14.410]
You and the will.

[02:38:14.590 --> 02:38:15.070]
Will for still.

[02:38:15.890 --> 02:38:17.430]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[02:38:17.630 --> 02:38:18.430]
Pound 5, 60.

[02:38:26.370 --> 02:38:27.030]
Here's Margate.

[02:38:27.130 --> 02:38:27.270]
Hello.

[02:38:27.970 --> 02:38:29.090]
Yeah, first time caller.

[02:38:29.570 --> 02:38:29.910]
Yes, sir.

[02:38:29.950 --> 02:38:31.470]
Before I'm going to touch about the religious thing.

[02:38:31.570 --> 02:38:34.110]
Every time I talk to somebody about religion, they're so into it.

[02:38:34.350 --> 02:38:35.530]
They can never answer any of my questions.

[02:38:35.850 --> 02:38:38.070]
Like, you know, God was everywhere in the beginning and now...

[02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:39.210]
They talk, they talk double talk.

[02:38:39.350 --> 02:38:40.270]
They go, but they wouldn't want it like that.

[02:38:40.450 --> 02:38:42.750]
Yeah, they don't, but they still, they got that fat thing going.

[02:38:42.910 --> 02:38:44.190]
So I can't, are you with them there?

[02:38:44.290 --> 02:38:44.750]
Good for them.

[02:38:45.210 --> 02:38:47.530]
On the panthers, I'm watching the game last night.

[02:38:47.650 --> 02:38:48.410]
Not the panther game.

[02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:48.410]

[02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:48.410]

[02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:48.410]

[02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:48.410]

[02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:51.170]
But another one, I see some guy in the ground for 15 minutes.

[02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:53.250]
I don't see one clip of what happened.

[02:38:53.810 --> 02:38:57.550]
So eight plus for those guys in the, uh, whatever crew that they're in because they suck.

[02:38:57.810 --> 02:38:58.790]
And, uh, third thing.

[02:38:58.950 --> 02:38:59.810]
What would you mean by that?

[02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:01.030]
I'm thinned your cat.

[02:39:01.130 --> 02:39:01.130]

[02:39:01.170 --> 02:39:03.110]
The game that was on last night was the flyers and the camps.

[02:39:03.350 --> 02:39:05.890]
Well, I'm a flyers fan, but I didn't see the game on the last night.

[02:39:06.050 --> 02:39:08.050]
I can understand why you're reluctant to admit that.

[02:39:08.070 --> 02:39:09.510]
Yeah, I'm no longer a fan, actually.

[02:39:09.630 --> 02:39:10.150]
We're so bad.

[02:39:10.310 --> 02:39:11.310]
We haven't spent money on anybody.

[02:39:11.550 --> 02:39:12.210]
Nice one, Beezer.

[02:39:12.370 --> 02:39:13.170]
He let it in a bit.

[02:39:13.310 --> 02:39:14.530]
Five greasy goals last night.

[02:39:14.590 --> 02:39:14.970]
Nice one.

[02:39:15.330 --> 02:39:16.290]
That's what my pops told me.

[02:39:16.290 --> 02:39:17.210]
But, uh, not.

[02:39:17.410 --> 02:39:21.690]
They didn't show a clip of the guy that, you know, Melanie gets nailed and they don't show for 15 minutes.

[02:39:21.790 --> 02:39:24.410]
They show them on the ground dying, but I don't see a clip of what happened.

[02:39:24.570 --> 02:39:26.170]
It just, you know, it pisses me off.

[02:39:26.210 --> 02:39:27.050]
Well, nobody hit him.

[02:39:27.050 --> 02:39:29.610]
He just lost his, he just skated to a run.

[02:39:29.610 --> 02:39:30.910]
Yeah, God hit him and he went down.

[02:39:31.090 --> 02:39:32.550]
God hit him and he just went right into the board.

[02:39:32.730 --> 02:39:33.190]
You know, I'm sure.

[02:39:33.350 --> 02:39:34.790]
That one was, uh, got frog gods.

[02:39:35.290 --> 02:39:37.630]
Well, no, I mean, I'm watching games sometimes and there'll be a fight going on.

[02:39:37.630 --> 02:39:39.150]
And the camera guy isn't even following them.

[02:39:39.210 --> 02:39:41.310]
They're just, uh, Florida's really bad when it comes to that.

[02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:42.030]
Very thing.

[02:39:42.530 --> 02:39:44.030]
I haven't, I haven't been late in a while.

[02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:48.810]
And, uh, starting to think about going gay, you know, find a nice guy, maybe watching football, get some head.

[02:39:49.170 --> 02:39:49.950]
Yeah, I don't think so.

[02:39:50.110 --> 02:39:55.530]
You know, it's all like the type 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:39:55.530 --> 02:39:56.690]
He's thinking of going gay.

[02:39:57.310 --> 02:39:59.350]
Gray, I think, maybe I think you look the litter out.

[02:40:00.690 --> 02:40:02.370]
Can't beat that gator me.

[02:40:03.230 --> 02:40:06.650]
There's something wrong with our TV.

[02:40:07.650 --> 02:40:13.810]
Our crew from director is a fan.

[02:40:15.790 --> 02:40:20.430]
I asked him what was so ugly.

[02:40:22.030 --> 02:40:26.810]
But he ran us out to duty, I'm gay.

[02:40:29.710 --> 02:40:35.090]
And then he's like, I'm a high school kid.

[02:40:35.090 --> 02:40:42.190]
I want to be a high school kid.

[02:40:44.210 --> 02:40:51.450]
Poor baby, he was wondering why no one ever talked to me.

[02:40:51.790 --> 02:40:58.450]
He was family, and sketchy-linked, and he said we will get you to this week.

[02:42:00.510 --> 02:42:03.250]
We have a program to let you guys.

[02:42:07.290 --> 02:42:09.710]
We have a program to let you guys.

[02:42:15.270 --> 02:42:18.470]
So anyway, thank you so much to the name of the movie was Hell Night with Linda Blair.

[02:42:19.270 --> 02:42:20.170]
And, uh, who did I say it was?

[02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:22.610]
It wasn't William, it was Vincent Van Patten, that was in that movie.

[02:42:22.870 --> 02:42:23.370]
So sorry.

[02:42:24.770 --> 02:42:26.250]
Running around naked to the home movie.

[02:42:26.290 --> 02:42:27.010]
How could you forget that?

[02:42:27.650 --> 02:42:29.010]
Here's a mobile in Miami Lake.

[02:42:29.150 --> 02:42:29.330]
Hello.

[02:42:30.690 --> 02:42:31.610]
Hello, Miami Lake?

[02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:32.150]
Yes, sir.

[02:42:32.250 --> 02:42:32.690]
Yeah, hi.

[02:42:32.990 --> 02:42:35.350]
Neil, first time I'm a caller, I enjoy your show.

[02:42:35.490 --> 02:42:35.770]
All right.

[02:42:36.050 --> 02:42:37.310]
Really, breath of fresh air.

[02:42:37.410 --> 02:42:37.810]
Yes, it is.

[02:42:38.010 --> 02:42:39.530]
Can I change this subject just a little bit?

[02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:40.210]
Anything you like, sir?

[02:42:40.390 --> 02:42:40.890]
Okay, thank you.

[02:42:41.370 --> 02:42:48.270]
Just watching, seeing in, Janet Reno is on, I don't know if she's on now, but she's on discussing the aid to Columbia.

[02:42:48.270 --> 02:42:54.590]
And this money that General, or the President, Pastrana, apparently wants $1.5 billion.

[02:42:55.090 --> 02:42:57.930]
Yeah, this war on drugs or whatever.

[02:42:58.050 --> 02:42:58.270]
Of course.

[02:42:58.390 --> 02:43:02.570]
You know, I married to a Columbia for 23 years, spent a Columbia many, many times.

[02:43:02.570 --> 02:43:02.910]
Right.

[02:43:03.070 --> 02:43:04.230]
That goes there six months ago.

[02:43:04.870 --> 02:43:10.190]
And as nice as the people are, as beautiful as this country is, this is a farce, really.

[02:43:10.310 --> 02:43:18.410]
I mean, this is a 1.5 billion that he's asking for of our tax money to go down and try to find a war that is really ridiculous.

[02:43:18.610 --> 02:43:18.890]
Of course.

[02:43:19.170 --> 02:43:20.010]
I feel powerless.

[02:43:20.010 --> 02:43:21.650]
I've wanted Donald Trump somewhere.

[02:43:21.970 --> 02:43:23.390]
Well, I don't care if people are starving.

[02:43:23.390 --> 02:43:28.830]
We have kids without textbooks in schools, and we're going to give a billion and a half dollars away as part of this ongoing farce.

[02:43:29.050 --> 02:43:32.430]
This, this, this dog and pony show they keep putting on for the war on drugs.

[02:43:32.470 --> 02:43:32.810]
Oh, that's ridiculous.

[02:43:32.910 --> 02:43:35.850]
In fact, I was just in Columbia about six or eight months ago, I guess.

[02:43:35.970 --> 02:43:39.890]
And we were discussing this, this is still called war on drugs with the people who were there in Columbia.

[02:43:40.150 --> 02:43:40.330]
Right.

[02:43:40.390 --> 02:43:41.450]
They're laughing at us.

[02:43:41.950 --> 02:43:47.630]
I mean, they, they mean, they're actually laughing at our government for the, I got a naive idea.

[02:43:47.850 --> 02:43:49.830]
Or whatever you want to call it, of any kind of money.

[02:43:49.970 --> 02:43:51.330]
They just had the piece on 60 minutes.

[02:43:51.330 --> 02:43:58.030]
They're a weaker to a goal about all the money that they've already spent, and about how they went down there in our, our CIA or whoever our defense department,

[02:43:58.230 --> 02:44:01.970]
when and trained all these soldiers, and about all the efforts that have been made.

[02:44:02.170 --> 02:44:03.370]
And it, it's a waste of time.

[02:44:03.470 --> 02:44:03.610]
Yes.

[02:44:03.770 --> 02:44:06.110]
As soon as they get rid of one guy, they got other drug lawyers.

[02:44:06.230 --> 02:44:06.830]
It's meaningless.

[02:44:07.010 --> 02:44:08.010]
I mean, that's absolutely nothing.

[02:44:08.130 --> 02:44:14.830]
So I don't know, I don't know what we can do as, as, I mean, it, you feel somewhat powerless because it's not in our hands.

[02:44:14.950 --> 02:44:17.750]
I mean, we're not talking about a million dollars for this or a minute.

[02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:19.670]
This is 1.5 billion, right?

[02:44:19.770 --> 02:44:20.170]
With a B.

[02:44:20.670 --> 02:44:26.630]
And it is a scary thing when you know that they're sending that kind of money to fight something that's basically,

[02:44:27.050 --> 02:44:28.530]
I mean, when are we going to,

[02:44:28.570 --> 02:44:29.610]
No, no, that fight's fun.

[02:44:29.710 --> 02:44:31.090]
You have the F-Rite, but they're fun.

[02:44:31.550 --> 02:44:35.470]
No, they're funding the bureaucracy that exists for this phony war on drugs.

[02:44:35.670 --> 02:44:39.790]
It's a multi-billion dollar bureaucracy, which is just a farce and a total fraud.

[02:44:39.910 --> 02:44:45.910]
Well, and like the governor of Mexico said last week, it's long overdue that we started decriminalizing drugs,

[02:44:45.910 --> 02:44:48.990]
and dealing with this as a health problem, not a criminal problem.

[02:44:49.210 --> 02:44:49.330]
Absolutely.

[02:44:49.590 --> 02:44:50.490]
Absolutely, when civilized countries.

[02:44:50.570 --> 02:44:57.030]
And I think when the American people wake up to that fact, it hopefully will either elect people like a Jesse Ventura,

[02:44:57.270 --> 02:45:01.850]
or someone who, who have the, at least, common sense, which is never the rule of thumb in Washington.

[02:45:02.310 --> 02:45:04.630]
Common sense to say, hey, this is ridiculous.

[02:45:05.050 --> 02:45:09.950]
And I'm not saying that Colombians are corrupt, but there is a tremendous amount of corruption on the higher levels.

[02:45:10.290 --> 02:45:13.270]
So this kind of money doesn't trickle down to where it's supposed to go.

[02:45:13.270 --> 02:45:19.070]
It just is wasted money, wasted tax money, and it's, you know, I just, I saw her on the CNN,

[02:45:19.350 --> 02:45:21.950]
10 minutes ago, I thought, you know, I got a call and say something.

[02:45:22.210 --> 02:45:23.150]
It's just ridiculous.

[02:45:23.430 --> 02:45:24.670]
We have to wake up in this country.

[02:45:24.790 --> 02:45:25.470]
Okay, I have a great thing.

[02:45:25.570 --> 02:45:25.910]
Thank you.

[02:45:26.650 --> 02:45:27.750]
What are you battling about?

[02:45:27.850 --> 02:45:28.650]
The Colombians are corrupt.

[02:45:29.730 --> 02:45:31.530]
He said he didn't want to say the Colombians are corrupt.

[02:45:32.010 --> 02:45:32.170]
Yeah.

[02:45:32.590 --> 02:45:33.470]
The Colombians are corrupt.

[02:45:33.630 --> 02:45:35.150]
Well, so we know, but it's the point.

[02:45:35.290 --> 02:45:37.070]
I mean, there you go, pick it on more Hispanics again.

[02:45:37.350 --> 02:45:38.610]
Anybody but the Cubans, okay?

[02:45:38.830 --> 02:45:40.770]
Thank God we don't have no corrupt Cubans here.

[02:45:41.250 --> 02:45:42.290]
First of all, you think about them.

[02:45:42.850 --> 02:45:44.170]
Yeah, let's pick on a Cubans.

[02:45:44.210 --> 02:45:45.070]
Leave the Colombians alone.

[02:45:45.210 --> 02:45:45.950]
Okay, they can't help it.

[02:45:45.970 --> 02:45:46.290]
They're ugly.

[02:45:47.450 --> 02:45:50.030]
Oh, here's the fact from Al Gorelstein telling us he's going to be in town.

[02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:50.950]
Yeah.

[02:45:51.130 --> 02:45:52.230]
We don't care about that.

[02:45:52.290 --> 02:45:53.470]
We like you, Al, but we don't care.

[02:45:53.570 --> 02:45:55.470]
You're not as important as you think you are.

[02:45:55.730 --> 02:45:57.130]
Although we do love that apartment in Amsterdam.

[02:45:57.150 --> 02:45:58.090]
We never would go there.

[02:45:58.190 --> 02:45:58.990]
Clean it up a little bit.

[02:45:59.050 --> 02:45:59.870]
Maybe we'll go there sometime.

[02:46:00.830 --> 02:46:02.470]
Get that toilet all cleaned up there.

[02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.890]
What a mess.

[02:46:03.130 --> 02:46:03.770]
What a slob.

[02:46:04.330 --> 02:46:05.170]
Here's Pepper Pine.

[02:46:05.290 --> 02:46:05.470]
Hello.

[02:46:06.450 --> 02:46:06.710]
Neil.

[02:46:06.990 --> 02:46:07.250]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:07.310 --> 02:46:09.070]
Oh, I'm going to have a chance to talk to you today.

[02:46:09.930 --> 02:46:23.130]
I'm going to have a chance to talk to you today.

[02:46:23.130 --> 02:46:23.130]

[02:46:23.130 --> 02:46:23.130]

[02:46:23.130 --> 02:46:23.130]

[02:46:23.130 --> 02:46:23.130]

[02:46:23.130 --> 02:46:23.130]

[02:46:23.130 --> 02:46:23.130]

[02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:23.750]

[02:46:24.130 --> 02:46:25.750]
I'm going to have a chance to talk to you today.

[02:46:25.750 --> 02:46:28.290]
I'm going to have a chance to talk to you today.

[02:46:28.370 --> 02:46:30.030]
I'm going to have a chance to talk to you today.

[02:46:30.130 --> 02:46:31.350]
I'm going to have a chance to talk to you today.

[02:46:31.550 --> 02:46:34.590]
I'm going to have a chance to talk to you today.

[02:46:34.850 --> 02:46:39.050]
I'm going to have a chance to talk to you today.

[02:46:40.070 --> 02:46:42.290]
I just want to disagree with the regime.

[02:46:43.530 --> 02:46:43.570]
Right.

[02:46:43.790 --> 02:46:47.190]
The only claim that he ever committed there was disagreeing with the regime of Castro.

[02:46:47.330 --> 02:46:47.550]
Right.

[02:46:47.890 --> 02:46:50.890]
I guess that anybody that went to that is entitled to go and demonstrate also.

[02:46:51.350 --> 02:46:51.790]
I didn't.

[02:46:52.150 --> 02:46:54.010]
But I think that everybody is entitled to their own opinion.

[02:46:54.710 --> 02:46:56.510]
I didn't have anybody that anybody that has to empathize on.

[02:46:56.930 --> 02:46:59.170]
First of all, you're supposed to have a permit to demonstrate.

[02:46:59.290 --> 02:46:59.930]
That's number one.

[02:47:00.270 --> 02:47:03.490]
And number two, under any circumstances, with or without a permit,

[02:47:03.770 --> 02:47:07.470]
you're not entitled to spit at people to throw rocks and bottles and batteries

[02:47:07.470 --> 02:47:09.230]
and people and try to intimidate them.

[02:47:09.430 --> 02:47:10.830]
That has nothing to do with the freedom here.

[02:47:11.050 --> 02:47:12.710]
And is that the very kind of repression?

[02:47:13.050 --> 02:47:14.430]
The very kind of repression?

[02:47:14.430 --> 02:47:14.430]

[02:47:14.430 --> 02:47:14.430]
