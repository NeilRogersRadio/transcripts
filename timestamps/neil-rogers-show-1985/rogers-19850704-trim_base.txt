[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340]
Okay, we have an open line two of them in Dade County the number is 624-0191.

[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.720]
624-0191, it's open-posed tonight.

[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.360]
Anything you'd like to talk about so long as it has to do with animals.

[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.700]
Anybody who would have heard the monologue and put that on tape and heard what I've

[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.580]
away started the show and then kind of tuned out for about 10 minutes and come back.

[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.400]
Probably would wonder if they're listening to the same station and the same program.

[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.140]
But we're just having a wonderful time here and we have an all points alert all over

[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.300]
the W-I-N-Z building to see if we can't find the cat so we can bring her on the

[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.420]
ear here kind of introduce her and does she have a name? Does it have a name?

[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.860]
Oh her name? Her name is Ashley? That's the cat?

[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.760]
Oh I see he, Chris gave the cat the name. Isn't he clever huh?

[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.100]

[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.440]
This is one of the best calls we've had all night. In fact this could be a new

[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.620]
format for the show we could have one night a week where we only talk to the

[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.880]
animals. Remember that record we could have her Ralph or play the music in the

[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:29.420]
