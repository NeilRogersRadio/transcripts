[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]
We are out at time, it's 10 o'clock, Neil Rogers is coming up next.

[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.060]
The music expressed on the previous programs are those of the host guests and

[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.300]
for that man Hessell back, he's got a live spot, baby.

[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.480]
All right.

[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.360]
The biggest names, the best talent.

[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.920]
Anybody out there you've got a live spot, this one you want us to go to.

[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.800]
Yes, I'm the O. Q. M.

[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.740]
I've searched for it.

[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.040]
WQ AM.

[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.500]
I AM A for the other day.

[00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.640]
No, George, today.

[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.620]
4.6.

[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.660]
Like sports radio 560 Q. A. M. brings you special coverage.

[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.420]
What is that?

[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.580]
I have no idea.

[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.160]
We're not from Tampa, Florida, we're not doing no special coverage.

[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.100]
Screw that.

[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.120]
Screw it.

[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.540]
Please here are no George for this.

[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.320]
For some reason, the A. B. Air is inspiring.

[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.300]
The one?

[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.980]
The A. B. Air is not fireings off of the call and engineer.

[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.940]
Oh boy, here we go.

[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.880]
Technical problems we haven't even said hello yet.

[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.660]
Guys, you get a lot of things.

[00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.160]
From Tampa, from the Super Bowl.

[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.700]
That's one conventional radio.

[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.000]
You A. B. Air.

[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.000]
George is home sick today or playing sick.

[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.800]
He's out.

[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.700]
Oh, fat ass roe, he please go away.

[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.560]
Find a new way to attack up a big go home and eat your whole homes.

[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.760]
Till you explode.

[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.840]
Just like your fat fat churned in ladies.

[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.260]
Have you buy two seats on a plane?

[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.560]
Spend in your fingers that have yellow stained from key jones.

[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.000]
Can't see your jones.

[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.000]
Faster, thinky-boone-oats.

[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.200]
Grounds of the fat disgusting and tasty oil.

[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.620]
You make the sugar-diffin smile.

[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.520]
They like a downed, sped and sassy.

[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.100]
Think smelly, fat, so repulsive and mild.

[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.080]
Your body cheese smells like a grappa.

[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.380]
After it was occupied by head pass.

[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.200]
Ner'nita, you want to get into your car.

[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.140]
Cussure to M. Y.

[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.480]
I can't squeal, I can't squeal, I can't squeal.

[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.200]
Fat lady, it's living with your lover less mean.

[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.140]
Slivering and starting the tree between her knees.

[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.640]
Fatty old yeast.

[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.220]
Most fishing to me.

[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.080]
That her number tune that's moist and tasty.

[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.460]
Fatty old yeast.

[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.600]
The edited version of a fat ass rosy.

[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.460]
From chicken neck this week.

[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.640]
He had to edit out GD.

[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.280]
Can you believe that?

[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.480]
Yes.

[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.360]
Yeah, you can, because you know you've been around the,

[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.100]
you've been around the, a lot a couple of times.

[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.840]
Three is for this today, because George is home pretending to be sick.

[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.960]
Oh, everybody in the house is sick.

[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.180]
He's been saying that all week, so we knew it was just a matter of time

[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.560]
before he would, you know, use that as an excuse.

[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.440]
Here's the first email of the day.

[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.900]
I mean, not the first in my pile, I've got a bunch of them.

[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.560]
Hey, at some point during the 12 o'clock hour,

[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.580]
you had a pig on the microphone.

[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.520]
Oops, I'm sorry.

[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.020]
That was not a pig that was kneeling into the microphone.

[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.060]
How professional.

[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.020]
For shame, kneel, at least learn to chew.

[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.500]
Screw you.

[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.180]
Not even a fake name on this one.

[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.520]
Just, just another.

[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.240]
Bah, bah, bah.

[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.660]
It's supposed to be funny is what it is.

[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.160]
And if you have no sense of humor, then don't waste your time listening to this.

[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.620]
You're going to have a show, okay?

[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.120]
If you're going to take everything like uptight, oh, it's a unprofessional.

[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.400]
They're eating on their screw you.

[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.140]
Not as unprofessional as these dumb jocks that are like

[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.340]
whoring all the media now during Super Bowl week.

[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.000]
We had Matt Hasselback on the Joe Roe show this morning

[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.460]
who had absolutely nothing to say, provided no insight whatsoever,

[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.040]
was inarticulate at best and terminally worse,

[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.420]
but he had a live spot at the end of the interview.

[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.440]
When Joe kind of led him into that live spot,

[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.340]
I just, I almost slid off this chair.

[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.780]
He would have felt it down there.

[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.440]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.300]
Matt Hasselback is the guest and he's doing a live spot

[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.660]
for some vitamin thing or some, somebody like that.

[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.320]
Now, how does that work?

[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.140]
Though all those guys are getting pimped to be out there

[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.680]
at the Super Bowl doing live spots.

[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.020]
So if they come on as a guest, they have to do like a live spot

[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.200]
for whoever's pain on to be out there.

[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.280]
And what do we get from it?

[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.780]
We get Matt Hasselback on the air with them.

[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.340]
Oh, God almighty.

[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.800]
Well, now we're talking.

[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.120]
And tomorrow we got Drew Rosenstein and Alex Marviz back again.

[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.600]
Oh, I'm going to kill myself right under here today.

[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.580]
I mean, George is out.

[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.700]
How can we possibly, even with Flea here,

[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.240]
how can we possibly make it through four hours without George

[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.780]
correcting us on everything we say?

[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.700]
That was just a little shot for him taking off today.

[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.580]
And here's an email from John.

[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.480]
Holy Schmidt, why is George so inadequate?

[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.440]
When you were talking about Dr. Pepper,

[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.000]
you were asking who makes it and all that.

[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.660]
George should have been googling that information for you.

[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.660]
This is the difference between a good producer and a bad one.

[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.180]
George should be on top of things, but it's not George's fault.

[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.120]
Neil, you are to blame.

[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.360]
You're too easy on George.

[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.460]
You need to get on his ass.

[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.180]
No thanks.

[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.760]
I don't want to do that.

[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.520]
He also has a condescending way of talking down to the audience

[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.020]
like when he was explaining elevators.

[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.460]
Oh, he has such a pseudo-electrical that says,

[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.340]
please, George, you're not an expert in elevators,

[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.340]
so stop with your whole year-than-now attitude

[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.840]
as you explain things to us.

[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.200]
How do you like that?

[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.100]
Sudo-electrical, George.

[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.000]
Condescending, talking down to the audience.

[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.940]
Well, George does know a lot of crap.

[00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.540]
I mean, useless crap, but he's like a walking encyclopedia of crap.

[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.180]
Yep.

[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.340]
Have you discovered that?

[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.800]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.700]
I mean, elevators.

[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.360]
You had the average schmuck on the street.

[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.320]
You'd say, well, what's the deal with an elevator?

[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.720]
Explain to me the ins and the outs and the ups and the downs and the floors

[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.860]
and how far apart they are.

[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.080]
And they would look at you like, are you crazy or what?

[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.520]
Do you have a thing with elevators?

[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.380]
Do you have any problem with them?

[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.120]
Because I don't.

[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.500]
No, I'm good with elevators.

[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.760]
I mean, I still, once in a while, have this thing about when the elevator opens up.

[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.220]
And in the back of my mind is this thing, I'm going to take a step out

[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.940]
and I'm going to be stepping into space.

[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.200]
The elevator isn't going to be at a floor.

[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.060]
You know what I mean?

[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.020]
Yes.

[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.800]
I mean, it's not like a phobia.

[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.340]
I'm not nervous about elevators.

[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.900]
I use them as it in times every day.

[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.600]
It's just something that once in a while pops into the back of my mind.

[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.060]
Like, oh, gee, I hope I'm stepping out of terra firmer, as opposed to like in a black hole.

[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.900]
But then again, we have 617 votes on the pool.

[00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.300]
And of course, leave it to Charlie B to phrase the pool.

[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.780]
I don't know.

[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.920]
I just want to kill some people.

[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.620]
It's what I want to do.

[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.060]
Wouldn't you like to have a free day?

[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.800]
One day in your lifetime, if you just go out and kill anybody you want, that'd be awesome.

[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.040]
Oh, God.

[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.540]
What I wouldn't give to do that.

[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.500]
I mean, Charlie B.

[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.340]
The day I was up 93 points, by the way.

[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.480]
Anybody here?

[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.280]
Anybody still invested in that crap?

[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.440]
No.

[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.840]
Put some lipstick on this peg.

[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:22.780]
It's the new economy.

[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.800]
You're not the only one right.

[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.020]
What would your critique be if Neil allowed it on the air?

[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.800]
See, the last part there, if I allowed it on the air, if I didn't want to allow it on the air, I wouldn't have done the pool, Charlie.

[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.540]
I mean, that's just stupid.

[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.100]
The implication being that, oh, well, Neil's not going to allow any criticism on the air.

[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:46.280]
I'd say a good half of the emails may be more than that that I read on the air are like ripping and tearing, because those are the ones that generally are entertaining.

[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.500]
What would your critique be if Neil allowed it on the air?

[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.060]
No complaints, 286.

[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.860]
Almost half the audience have no complaints.

[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.920]
And in South Florida, that's quite an accomplishment.

[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.200]
That's shocking.

[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.180]
George 76 of those who list a complaint, George is number one.

[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.120]
So that'll teach him to be out sick today.

[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.520]
The repeating stream archive commercial 64, let me say it again.

[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.000]
We can't do anything about it.

[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.400]
I don't know.

[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.760]
I don't want anyone to hear about it again.

[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.840]
Not enough calls 61.

[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:17.560]
Too bad.

[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.380]
Neil's not in Miami 40.

[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:20.920]
Too bad.

[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.440]
All of it snowing like the end of the world here.

[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.660]
We're going to have like 10 inches of snow by the end of the day.

[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.000]
It is snowing like hell.

[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.380]
No wood buying today.

[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.180]
Save me some money.

[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:28.420]
Good.

[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.760]
Neil's mailing it in 35.

[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.180]
Well, you know the cost of postage, man.

[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.200]
It's going up all the time.

[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.120]
Too many fake emails, 27.

[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.520]
Eating on a year is 15 like that email.

[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.760]
Real on professional.

[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.000]
Neil for shame.

[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.100]
Yeah, shame on you.

[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.240]
Too much slot talk 15, which is interesting because we almost never talk about that.

[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.520]
And too much food talk.

[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:48.960]
Five.

[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.620]
I don't think there's such a thing as too much food talk.

[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.240]
I agree.

[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.620]
Because the audience eats it up so to speak.

[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.680]
Oh, Tracy and Kendall says what a pull idea.

[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.740]
The best live performance you've ever seen.

[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.760]
I think we've done that.

[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.580]
Tracy with another one.

[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.460]
And it's the same thing all over again.

[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.560]
Well, thanks Tracy.

[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.660]
Once would have been sufficient.

[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.360]
Have a nice day.

[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.680]
Thank you so much.

[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.960]
Why do people do that?

[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.420]
Why do they send things more than once?

[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.240]
Are you eating?

[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.360]
No, of course not.

[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.800]
Oh, it sounded like you were talking with the food in your mouth.

[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.220]
Have something in your mouth.

[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.000]
Absolutely not.

[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.480]
Oh, don't start like George now.

[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.020]
In fact, tomorrow is Thursday.

[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.880]
We've got E. Corcini coming and I'm sure George will be back on Thursday for free lunch.

[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:39.460]
Oh, for sure.

[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.020]
Wouldn't you think?

[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.000]
Yeah, then he'll probably be out sick again on Friday.

[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.780]
He'll have a relapse.

[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.380]
Oh, no, he can't be because Friday.

[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.900]
Is he going to be a Gulf Stream this Friday?

[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:46.580]
No.

[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:47.680]
No?

[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.980]
No, I don't think so.

[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.660]
Are you sure?

[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:53.900]
Yeah, I'm positive.

[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.720]
He's not there this Friday.

[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.140]
No.

[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.040]
Well, like I said, then it'll probably be out sick again Friday.

[00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.540]
All the way.

[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.720]
Do have the handicapping thing.

[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.500]
How come we don't have like a liner?

[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.660]
An ongoing promo about the pick the pony contest?

[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:06.440]
Oh, we do.

[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.640]
That runs outside of your show.

[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.300]
Oh.

[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:14.260]
Well, why would we want to run it outside of the show when it's primarily for the people who listen to this show?

[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.360]
Maybe there's some people that listen outside of your show that don't listen to the show yet.

[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.020]
Maybe.

[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.880]
Oh, you've been hanging around with Joe Bell too long.

[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.080]
I mean, that's just that is a shocker.

[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.660]
Yeah, it's possible.

[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.300]
There might be one or two.

[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.560]
And then the people who you're talking about, they're not going to listen to the show.

[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.900]
This is another sports show.

[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.980]
They want to hear Matt Hasselback doing live spots for some hoax-pocus stuff.

[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:46.640]
Yes.

[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.820]
So in other words, all these jocks have got like their own sponsor and they're going around hawking some sponsor on all their interviews.

[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:53.460]
Exactly.

[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.100]
Oh, my God.

[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.120]
Are you kidding me?

[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.540]
Oh, what a whore business.

[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.240]
And here we thought prostitution was illegal.

[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.920]
I mean, I've always said this is a whore business.

[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.300]
But now we've taken it to a brand new level.

[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:06.820]
God.

[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.540]
A whore business.

[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.420]
And the fleece, as we can talk about the fact the station is moving down the street.

[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.760]
It's not a big secret.

[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.500]
It's not a secret as far as I know.

[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.740]
It sounds like a cost-cutting measure to me.

[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.540]
Oh, sure.

[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.620]
Let's cut this and let's cut that.

[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.980]
Let's cut the crap as well.

[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.580]
And I say, you better get ahold of your buddy, Jolly Jo, and sit him down and have a hard-tired talk.

[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.280]
Look him in the eye and say, don't you understand what is going on here?

[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:33.740]
You idiot.

[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.060]
You fool. You moron.

[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:35.820]
You jackass.

[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.160]
That's what you ought to say right off the bat for starters.

[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.040]
Okay.

[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.900]
And then after he says, you're fired after that.

[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.960]
See if he'll give you like a personal loan.

[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.060]
Does he have a lot of money?

[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.660]
I would imagine he's doing okay.

[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.160]
No, but I mean, is he like a wealthy guy like Greg Reader?

[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.820]
Is he like more in the slipper class?

[00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.340]
He lives a very modest life, so maybe he has a lot of money in the bank.

[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.640]
Oh, in other words, he's cheap.

[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.160]
The fleece says that Joe Bell is cheap.

[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.580]
I like to use the word 50.

[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.480]
Yeah, tight as a snare drum.

[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.700]
So it's a good thing I looked at my emails this morning because I'm sitting here around, oh, I don't know, 8.15.

[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.180]
I mean, they're about.

[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.340]
And I come across one from Lee.

[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.660]
It says, I'm not sure if George contacted you, but he's out sick today.

[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.940]
No, he did not contact me.

[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.340]
He did not contact me.

[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.840]
It's a damn good thing you sent this to me.

[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.680]
Otherwise, I'd have been sitting here until 9.25.

[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.840]
I'm wondering where the hell is George and what's going on?

[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:33.200]
I would have been calling him to and probably waking him up out of a deep slumber where he shacked up in some

[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.860]
free bag hotel with some hooker somewhere with some slut.

[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.560]
See, he blames on everybody else in the house being sick.

[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:47.460]
But I think it's his decadent lifestyle with all the drugs and all the hookers, the cheap flusies.

[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.380]
I think the Lord is punishing George.

[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.060]
He'll cut.

[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.700]
Is what it is.

[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.700]
But he'll be back one of these days.

[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:01.980]
And I hope he's back tomorrow and not only just because the free food is coming in, but because he's winning the poll.

[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.120]
Other than no complaints, which that's nice.

[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.460]
45.6% of the audience have got no complaints.

[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.160]
Of course, that's not counting that people who are already long gone.

[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:12.860]
Right.

[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.420]
Is there some way we could put on there too much joys?

[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.540]
I think we can do that.

[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:20.880]
Too much censorship.

[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.380]
Do it censorship.

[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.320]
Can you put that on there? Are you capable of doing that?

[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:25.960]
I can do that.

[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:26.740]
I can do it right now.

[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:27.960]
All around guy.

[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.680]
It's good to have an all around guy like this.

[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.860]
All of the last all around guy we got was Miguel.

[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.920]
Miguel, let's go bar.

[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:39.460]
He got canned and went across this street because he was like, oh, look at this.

[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.260]
Jimmy Cifalus says, your horse ball station is going down the drain.

[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.440]
You were destined for James Crystal Radio.

[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.640]
This guy coming from this coming from a guy who's got a three share and it's not even of course really him, but nevertheless.

[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.620]
News radio 610 is the highest rated AM station in the market.

[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.620]
You can spread all the false rumors you want, but the format is staying put.

[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.260]
Liberal talk isn't getting any numbers.

[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.600]
This is why cheap channels considering flipping 940 back to Fox Sports.

[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.880]
This move of a water down already saturated format in the market.

[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.120]
Your numbers will continue to fall till their fractions.

[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.500]
Oh, thanks Jimmy.

[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.300]
Jimmy's not also a ratings expert.

[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.940]
Here's one that says George is not sick.

[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.360]
He's trapped in the elevator somewhere.

[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.300]
Maybe he's getting the shaft.

[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.960]
Oh, here's another poll.

[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.080]
You never put this one up.

[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.860]
How much credit card that you have?

[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.760]
That's a good full ID.

[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.260]
You like that?

[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.200]
Oh, I like that one a lot.

[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.120]
Surely says I tried to give George a winning ticket.

[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.120]
The Gulf Stream handicraft were also picked the same horse.

[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.380]
Yeah, but you know what, Shirley?

[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.600]
This horse didn't win.

[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:36.900]
See?

[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.020]
We appreciate you're giving George the ticket.

[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.640]
By the way, he'll be back out there February 20th.

[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.520]
February 20th?

[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.600]
Well, that's a long ways away.

[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.140]
Yeah.

[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.760]
Well, of course, he's got to save up some money to gamble in between now and then.

[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.940]
You call that a format?

[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.400]
Water rusting and with private money.

[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.200]
But I was in the sky above.

[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.080]
Now I'm in a submarine.

[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.680]
Water's cold, freezing my toes.

[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:26.460]
A bag of blue diamond nuts is floating by my nose.

[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:33.300]
Oh, you don't need the hooks you might could see.

[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:40.600]
A rocket broke before this piece in a bucket of concrete.

[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.600]
That'd be for me.

[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.400]
I can take this over one more way.

[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.800]
Thanks to a drop of steel 50s.

[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.780]
That's even the water rush.

[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.980]
10,18 at 5.60 W.A.M.

[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.440]
Here's a mama B's complaint.

[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:09.720]
It says my complaint is that your show is not as jui as it used to be when you used to eat all that Jew food.

[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.700]
Oh, that's because number one, I'm not down there and number two week.

[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:17.080]
Don't eat.

[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.860]
We can't get food on here because your buddy Joe Bell is a hard ass and idiot.

[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:31.620]
Is that his goal is to make the that that's what I think his goal in life is to make all the people around him as miserable as possible.

[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.120]
Because he does things that are inexplicable.

[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.700]
I mean that whole thing about not having people bring free food in any of that.

[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.280]
That's one of the very few perks of working in this business.

[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.560]
And anybody that's ever been in the business for more than five minutes knows that.

[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.380]
Surely flea knows that.

[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:46.920]
Oh, yeah.

[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.240]
Free food, baby.

[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.760]
That's where it's at.

[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.880]
In addition to which even if I were down there, most of the Jew food places like the Villa deli long gone.

[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.760]
They used to bring us food.

[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.120]
See, I would be was the that was the place.

[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.100]
I mean Zeta, I did pretty good on free food.

[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:08.300]
And the even I and Z and WNWS I think I don't remember if we could eat on the year back then.

[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.160]
But I would be we ate on the year like pigs and I and Z in the morning early.

[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.280]
We had a place that used to make his cheeseburgers at 815 in the morning.

[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.200]
Really good cheeseburgers.

[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.120]
I feel where the hell was.

[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.980]
I remember when I used to listen to you in Tampa.

[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.080]
I used to be eating all the time.

[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:23.800]
Yeah.

[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.120]
In Tampa?

[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.040]
When you're on SUN.

[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:28.740]
Oh, God.

[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.300]
Well, I was in a good mood this morning too.

[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.560]
And Sputta lose my ass yesterday.

[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.500]
And Sputta all the snow.

[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.560]
But Tampa.

[00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.580]
So you were in Tampa at that time?

[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.100]
Yes.

[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.380]
Doing what?

[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.600]
I was working at 98 rock in Tampa.

[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:47.900]
Doing what?

[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.460]
Started doing nights.

[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.080]
I did mornings for like two years.

[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.560]
Now were you a Lasseter listener?

[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:55.800]
Yeah.

[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.080]
Yeah.

[00:17:58.740 --> 00:17:59.100]
Yeah.

[00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.600]
My protege.

[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:01.780]
No.

[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.300]
Oh, what a shame about him.

[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:13.880]
Every time I start thinking about my diabetes and losing my feet and my eyes and kidneys

[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.060]
and croaking early.

[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.200]
I start thinking about blobbo.

[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.000]
And I'm thinking about that blog.

[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.280]
Did you ever read any of the blogs, the entries that he wrote?

[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:22.880]
No.

[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.540]
I don't like blogs.

[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.520]
I don't either.

[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.620]
I started one under my space thing and I wrote one or two entries and I thought

[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.940]
What do I need to have a blog for when I got four hours to BS on the air every day?

[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.800]
What do I need to blog for right I just I don't get that

[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.260]
Like Tom jikkin now there's a guy a little Tommy's got a blog at the Sun Central and I don't know why because he writes a column there

[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.520]
Yeah, but nobody needs newspaper anymore

[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.940]
I understand that but nobody certainly nobody reads his blog

[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.100]
Can you imagine going online to read the time jikka blog no

[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:59.140]
Have I great but he writes he writes stuff in there that he doesn't have the balls to write in the regular column

[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:07.120]
You know like you know what I mean right like opinions Greg Cody to it never read his blog Greg Kotex. Yeah, he's horrible

[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.320]
Well, yeah, that's why he's across the street

[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:15.240]
He's just another one of the shills you do understand that there's this sports fraternity all these it's just it's sick

[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.600]
It's like a sickness and they just all keep showing up like up here

[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.560]
It's the same thing all these talking heads they appear on all the different channels the same people the same 10 people

[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:31.640]
Bill waters and Nick hip-reos was a who was a horrible hockey player by the way the Leafs are the worst hockey team in history

[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.620]
Panthers nice one last night over the flyers three to two

[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:41.960]
And the Leafs lost him in a soda six to one they are they're an abortion. I might be huh my lightning one yesterday

[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.060]
You're lightning they're that's rare

[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.180]
They're careful they started to pick it up a little bit lately

[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.580]
I'll want to tell you one thing about the Leafs there ain't nobody like Luke Shen. Oh my god. Hey Luke

[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.660]
Maybe Luke will come over for lunch today

[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:01.100]
You think no there he goes again step with that factory with a fag tuck well

[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.400]
You got to have something if you can't win any games you got at least have somebody on the team looks good, you know

[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.080]
He's a hell of a player

[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.760]
Luke Shen you know him you don't know you're hockey at all mister you don't know squad

[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.960]
No, well that's that's because unfortunately nobody out there cares

[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.980]
I wonder I saw a little bit of the game last night the Panther game

[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:26.460]
But it was kind of hard to tell what the crowd was like whether it was like packed or whether it was it should have been for the flyers

[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.080]
And it was a pretty good game from what I saw yeah, gold guilty was all

[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:40.540]
Don't go picking out guilty again. He's a great talent and you just need to take him under did you hear that thing we had yesterday about guilty?

[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.860]
No, I did not oh what an email that was

[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:52.280]
About how if we had any class we would take him under our wing and teach him oh

[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:52.760]
No

[00:20:53.600 --> 00:21:00.680]
The celebrity columnist who created the New York Post-Gossip he paid six died in his Manhattan home James Brady was 80 that's old enough

[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.980]
His he worked until his death on Monday cause of his death hasn't been announced his last column

[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.940]
Well up here February 15th featuring actor Kevin Bacon

[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:17.760]
How do you like that never I never heard the guy but we certainly all know paid six right even the glam know about paid six

[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:24.340]
Here's a question hey do you change the kind of tires on your car in the winter no?

[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.820]
I do not and I don't drive in the snow so that should answer your question

[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:36.240]
Do I change the kind of tires the one I mean that's one of the biggest games you know all weather tires and winter tires and all of the chains

[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.180]
It's a scam

[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:45.120]
I mean like on a day like today am I gonna drive today have to be a lunatic I'd have to be a crazy person

[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.900]
I should be committed if I would drive on a day like this with ten inches of snow falling

[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:58.720]
Vuggsy says Neil you seem very uncomfortable when you say a hole and really want to say the whole phrase I would humbly suggest

[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:05.600]
Goldies goch sound bite and then you ever ever really say for example you goch all oh god

[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.820]
Here's another guy tell me how to do the show

[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:14.640]
I'm not the least bit uncomfortable saying a holy god 666 votes 666 on the pull right now

[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:22.740]
And six already you just added on there six already say too much joy is too much censorship is there from plain

[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:28.580]
Although George is still leading the way with 79 votes. Why do they hate George so much? I don't know

[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:35.200]
Because he's kind of sending a little bit because he talks about things that nobody cares about like roller skating and

[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.200]
Sign language maybe a little I

[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:46.000]
Don't know what it is maybe we'll take a separate poll on that someday when George is here of course not when he's out for telling to be sick

[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:53.680]
Did he sound sick to you? Did you speak to him or did you send you a message? It was just text oh I didn't even get that

[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:58.480]
I mean like yesterday. I got a text a running late. You know he'll send me text messages running late

[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.100]
Whatever had to go back home had to do a doose had to do something

[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.980]
But today on the days when he's out sick he tells everybody else in the world but not me I

[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.940]
Think he fears the response, you know like I know you're faking it

[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.420]
I

[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.280]
Mean I wasn't thinking that that day when I couldn't talk when I had that bad cold three four weeks ago

[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.360]
Whatever was and I was like oh

[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.980]
Scratchy and couldn't speak and I went to woodbind and what's wrong with that?

[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:30.640]
Well, he's taking these airborne which is crap to begin with and I just noticed on the bottle it expired 109

[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.740]
Maybe that made him sick

[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:41.960]
So it just expired this month. So what's the big deal with that? I don't know I've taken medication to the spur two three years ago

[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.020]
Wow, yeah, you really buy into that you really believe that crap

[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.940]
Come on flea boy

[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:55.720]

[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.260]

[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.800]
Pretending he's on to talk about the Super Bowl. He's on to pedal some crap. That's all he's on to make a buck

[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:11.820]
Aren't these guys getting paid enough these dumb jokes without coming on and hooring our radio station and driving the audience away

[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:16.780]
What does that mean just want to make sure everything was alright? I guess yeah, we're surviving somehow George. We're getting it done

[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.520]
The repeating stream archive commercial 69 not enough calls 63

[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.080]
Wait to hear this story

[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.700]
Well, you're not gonna be all that it's just pathetic

[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:54.060]
Lawyers agreed Christian high school case would apply to California private schools schools can expel students who seem gay appeals court rules

[00:29:54.060 --> 00:30:01.560]
A California appeals court ruled yesterday that a Christian high school can expel students perceived to be lesbians

[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.280]
I'm holding a 2008 lower court ruling that there were no

[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.000]
triable elements to the case

[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:13.040]
The fourth district court of appeals and Riverside on Monday upheld California Lutheran high schools right as a private religious

[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:18.680]
Organization to exclude students based on sexual orientation the ruling was really released late yesterday

[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:25.140]
The two 16 year old girl sued the school for expeling them on the basis of a bond of intimacy characteristic of a lesbian

[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:30.260]
Relationship under a California discrimination law. They were a little bit too tight so to speak

[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:35.400]
It's almost as like a we could roll the clock back 20 or 30 years of progress who made this area

[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:41.780]
Kirk Hanson the girls are trained till the LA times basically this decision gives private schools the license to discriminate no

[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:48.500]
While the court called its own decision narrow lawyers on both sides of the case said it would likely shield protect

[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:57.860]
It would likely shield protect private schools whatever that means beyond simply the Christian school in lawsuit from anti-discrimination suits

[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:07.040]
A California appeals court ruled that the I see the fourth district court of appeals and Riverside Monday upheld California Lutheran schools right as a private

[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.700]
Religious organization to exclude the students

[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:18.480]
John McCay attorney for California Lutherans has the schools goal is to educate based on Christian principles which doesn't include being a couple of dikes

[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.500]
Couple of lezzies

[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.640]
Couple of bull bikes

[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:33.320]
Is now what religions all about anyway is like hatred and discrimination and bigotry and killing people seems to be right so there you go

[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:37.100]
What's wrong with that makes sense to me if it's based on religious principles

[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.300]
Where's the one about Brandon?

[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:49.940]
Yeah, we got a hate a hate email about Brandon. I'll get to that after the break and also an email from Brandon

[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.960]
So they're go it's Brandon this and Brandon that who the hell's brother?

[00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.680]
Oh, some of you people manage just how would you like to have to live with some of these people? No, thanks. Oh my god

[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.660]
Rob says winter tires are an excellent alternative to all season radials

[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.700]
Softer compounds made by superior rubber companies make ice driving easy

[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:14.200]
You should ask some of your hockey boys who live in the North says Robin Clarkson, Michigan

[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.920]
Well, Rob I hate to break the news to you. I don't have any hockey boys

[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.720]
Although maybe Luke Shen will show up here this afternoon for a gay old time

[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.100]
But I'm not I'm not you have any idea how much the car the tires cost on the vet

[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:33.780]
Those big gigantic wide tires the ones that never go flat. I mean they won't go flat. You can drive like 500 miles on a flat

[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.740]
You know the tires I'm talking about the good years. Yes

[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.200]
Well, they're the cost of fortune

[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:45.860]
So I could only imagine what winter tires would cost for a Corvette if they even make such a thing

[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:50.120]
I don't know. I'm sure some some mayven in the audience will let me know. I'm not gonna do that

[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.500]
Like on a day like today. I'm if I were gonna risk my life

[00:32:54.500 --> 00:33:00.040]
I'd call my cad guy my lesbianies cad guy and he would drive me and even he I'm sure wouldn't want to go out there today

[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:07.460]
When there's snow and ice and black ice on the road man forget it stay home

[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:13.960]
Go to the Chinese no speaking English market and buy a few of goodies some junk food and stay inside and watch TV all day

[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:20.920]
And a good idea sounds good to me or listen to that I could come in here listen all the great sports shows on

[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:30.460]
What president George W. Bush is thinking right now George better hurryer will miss the inauguration

[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.800]
George man. I love lucky charge. They really are magically delicious

[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:40.820]
I bet I could get you at leprechaun if you wouldn't hide in a cave in Pakistan

[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.020]
Oh

[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.420]
That's it wow

[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.440]
God what a short bit how long was that one moment please 21 seconds

[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.460]
Can you believe that no not really oh

[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:01.440]
Well anyway it killed 21 seconds 1046 a QM

[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.400]
Let's take a look at the rest of the schedule for a Wednesday

[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:08.400]
We got the big O with the Super Bowl the big O with his one-one cheer. He's really rock solid

[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.140]
In fact the fleet was saying before to show today that he's killing Mandage the big O

[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.200]
Is that what you were saying something like that?

[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.680]
Mad dog at the Super Bowl 4 to 7 of course we had a

[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:23.500]
Succession of a lead-ins for Mandage that our unsatisfactory that have no numbers at all

[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:30.880]
We had that and then we had that and then we had come at you and now we got the rock solid this

[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.080]
Mandates at the Super Bowl 4 to 7

[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.720]
And then we got Dolphin tonight at the Super Bowl from a seven-a-way that won't help

[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:42.860]
That show is beyond help and then 8 to 11 it's the D. A show which also flee was saying

[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:47.460]
His horrible lead in and being on at night with no signal those two things contribute to having a

[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.320]
Point at 9 o'clock

[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:54.640]
How is it possible look at the hours and see that there's nobody listening that hour?

[00:34:54.740 --> 00:35:03.160]
I don't know the doesn't your good friend Joe Bell doesn't he like raises eyebrows and like a fart a little bit when he when he sees that I would hope so

[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.880]
I mean, you know you have all these

[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.540]
Conversations with him you and he are like tight as a drum

[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.920]
What is his comment about that it's the signal oh

[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:23.420]
Here's one about Joe Rose. It said why didn't Joe at ask Matt Hassel back why his bubble headed wife is such a

[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.040]
Bible-thumping crazy person huh?

[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:32.260]
I probably would have been outside the parameters of the sports ash-looking fraternity. They just don't do that to each other

[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:39.440]
They're on there like to kiss kissy kissy kissy and get the live spots on baby get the spot on there Matt

[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.340]
I still can't believe that I mean I know I've heard other guy like Rosenhaus. He's got his own spot, right?

[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:46.400]
yes

[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.000]
And who else who of the other people we have

[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.180]
Chronically on the year destroying the audience who else brings in a spot I

[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:59.420]
Can't think of any others the rescue paid

[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.980]
The rest get paid like Kurt Herbstreet

[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:10.960]
Kurt your street gets paid to be on the year absolutely by us. I would think so by this radio station

[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.940]
It's firing people left and right that's making cutbacks and it's moving down the street

[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.220]
So we can all be in the same building to cut back costs I

[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:23.300]
Think Marino comes with spots. Oh

[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:23.900]
Yeah, Marino

[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:32.020]
I think Joe actually goes over to the house and services Danny boy that though those you do understand how tight those two are have been for years

[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:36.460]
They still take showers together Wow and not just after the game either

[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.380]
Here's one ripping George and ass

[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.420]
Little teach you to be out sick today George

[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.600]
Putting aside the fact that George is a boring. I'm always right snob who is probably gay

[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.460]
No, he's not and believe me has no reason to be a snob about anything

[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.580]
You always say other people should not be on here because they don't have a good voice

[00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.740]
Well, George's voice is terrible for radio

[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:04.320]
He almost has a magical power to put people to sleep in seconds with just a sound of his voice

[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.340]
Well, that's something we have a lot of insomnia out there a lot of old parts who can't sleep

[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:12.760]
Boy look at the snowman it is just oh

[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.980]
Nicely and of course the Northeast the US thankfully we're not getting the ice the mix you know

[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:21.320]
But in the Northeast and even in the South like Arkansas

[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:26.700]
They're getting the snow and rain mix freezing rain. Oh boy. You ever drive on that?

[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:32.040]
No, I have not if ever driven on a black ice where you think it's just a dry road and all of a sudden

[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.400]
Oh gee, I'm like sliding a little all over the road. No

[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:36.280]
Don't do it

[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:40.880]
I didn't see anything about the tires for my snow tires for the Corvette

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:46.720]
All these people. Oh you ought to do this. I don't see anything about it. I'm looking on there. I see nothing about it

[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:51.580]
Oh

[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.260]
Here's here's one of the dumbest things I ever read good morning

[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:59.940]
I heard on Fox that palen is switching to become a Democrat. You think she and Hillary will run in four years together. Oh, yeah

[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.800]
She's switching to become a human being

[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.440]
Sarah

[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.680]
But I'm sure that the people at NBC at SNL would love to have her back

[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.440]
The ratings were never higher

[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:20.380]
Time and Madison, Wisconsin says you pee and moan about Tampa. He doesn't say pee, but I can't I can't say the word that you put on the air

[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:24.060]
That's right. You'll get suspended you peen. I will not

[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:29.360]
No, no, and in this context I could actually use it, but I'm not I'm not gonna do it

[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.460]
You pee and moan about Tampa, but I discovered you won WSU N

[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.240]
Well, what does that have to do with anything?

[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:43.100]
Every year I spend two weeks on C.S. to key sitting on the beach and watching spring training games those with the days

[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:50.180]
Being for Madison, Wisconsin, Twix and Florida is great after all the cold and snow when I discovered you on the internet

[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.840]
I was ecstatic. I listen all day every day at work makes the day go by quick

[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.900]
Thanks for being on the net Tom Arn, Wisconsin who doesn't and Madison

[00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:02.380]
He doesn't even have any complaints about the the streaming spots on there that repeat over. He's just happy to hear the show

[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:07.340]
Well, see there's one good reason to be honest you went is that this guy discovered the show

[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.360]
And by the way, they do make snow tires for a Corvette

[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.800]
Did you Google it? Yeah, winter 240 Perreilles

[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.580]
Yeah, how much are they? It doesn't say it, but I'm sure they're expensive

[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:23.060]
Yeah, the ones I got on there now just a regular tires are like $350 400 bucks a piece

[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.520]
So I would imagine winter tires cost and and it's already the end of January

[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:36.100]
You got February and then you got maybe March all depending on the groundhog, you know and then it's back to a regular dry

[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.200]
tires

[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:42.520]
And what do you do with tires? Well, what do you do with them when you get winter tires?

[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.140]
I have no idea. What do you do with your regular tires? Do they store them for you at the tire place?

[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.580]
I mean, what do you do with them?

[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.360]
You sure don't have room for them in the trunk and of course the Corvette doesn't have any trunk anyway

[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.060]
So what the hell am I going to do with them? Or am I going to stick them back home? Yeah, I'm sure

[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.420]
Nick says enough with the elevators, please

[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:07.080]
Think your recent onslaught of negative emails inspired me to write in so here it goes

[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.700]
Oh sure keep writing negative crap. That's fine with us

[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.700]
Makes it very entertaining

[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:13.020]
I

[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:17.980]
Tune into your show at the beginning of today's show meaning yesterday and you were going on and on about some guy named Brandon

[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.120]
And his nightmares about elevators and his fear of elevators and Brandon this and Brandon that

[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.140]
elevators this elevators that

[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.240]
For a second, I looked at the dollar make sure this was 560

[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.560]
I wouldn't have known it was the near Roger show. I if I hadn't recognized your voice

[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.680]
What is this who is Brandon? Why why should I care about his dreams?

[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:40.900]
Why should I care about some random listener no more Brandon enough get out of my life Brandon get out of my life

[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.800]
And the near Roger show

[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:49.260]
After that I just shut off the radio and thought to myself how the mighty have fallen. I couldn't believe this was the near Roger show

[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.100]
Oh, yeah

[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:53.160]
Oh, and speaking of nightmares. I had a nightmare today

[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.940]
I dreamt that I tuned into 560 and instead of the near Roger show

[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.140]
They were airing dream talk with Neil and George

[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:04.200]
Please no more dream analyzing it said well that was the topic was on the pole. Okay you idiot real idiot

[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:10.980]
And Brandon is one of our longtime regular listeners and contributors and he doesn't he doesn't send chronic complaints like this

[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.220]

[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:15.460]
Ba he contributes to the show which is what the emails are for

[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.400]
Not oh if I can't call in where do I register my complaints?

[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:24.140]
This isn't complaint line. Okay. That's not the name of this freaking show complaint line

[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.100]
Which is what most of you idiots want to do

[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.280]
So we gave you the poll today to register your complaints

[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:33.060]
No more dream analyzing it was a one-day topic. Okay

[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.900]

[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:44.600]

This bag that and dropping Hulk Hogan's name like you dropped your pants to take a choice

[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:17.960]
I guess that's his main topic as Hulcogan. Yes, there, buddy. See. Yeah Hulcogan is his boring. Is dog d Texas man

[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:23.860]
You ever see that reality show that he's on?

[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:24.840]
Hogan has best.

[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.160]
Is that what it's called?

[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:26.940]
Yeah, it's terrible.

[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:29.400]
Oh my God, is that a horrendous show?

[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:30.980]
Well, they're all horrendous.

[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:34.240]
And by the way, those tires would cost you $335 each.

[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.620]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:36.400]
That's US.

[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.100]
Yes.

[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.360]
So about 400 bucks Canadian each.

[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.340]
1600 bucks for tires that I'm going to use for a month

[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:42.660]
and a half.

[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.920]
I don't think so, and I'm not going to be using them that much anyway.

[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.300]
See, I pick and choose my spots.

[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:52.460]
I drive on the days like, let's see, was it yesterday?

[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.140]
See that's what I had.

[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.820]
No, yesterday I took my cabby.

[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:58.560]
The day before and the day before that.

[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:00.580]
Monday and Sunday.

[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.160]
I drove.

[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:04.500]
Sunday morning Monday night.

[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:09.120]
And that's because the roads were nice and dry and it was not a lot of traffic or early

[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.800]
Sunday morning and Monday evening.

[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.620]
This town's like a ghost town now anyway.

[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.220]
Because everybody's out of work.

[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.360]
It's an oppression baby.

[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.800]
Everybody's getting canned.

[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:19.220]
Oh, brother, or they're in Halendale.

[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.140]
No, you see you're confused again.

[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.460]
Those are the French Canadians.

[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:24.260]
They're not from Toronto.

[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.920]
They're from Montreal and Quebec.

[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.080]
You don't understand.

[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.480]
Don't be blaming those people on us.

[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:29.080]
Okay, sorry.

[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.020]
Those are the freaking frogs.

[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:33.140]
A slime of the earth.

[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.820]
The subhuman slime balls.

[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:36.100]
God.

[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:42.680]
See, I can't believe that a guy like you is that unaware that you lump in all Canadians

[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.680]
with a French Canadians.

[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.440]
Do you know how insulting that is?

[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:46.400]
My bad, I apologize.

[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.600]
10.56 a.m. fleas with us because Georgia is pretending to be out sick today.

[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.260]
Georgia will be back tomorrow because we have great free food coming in.

[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.360]
And Joe Bell won't let him get to free food the other days of the week.

[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.140]
I bet you Georgia's really PO now that Wayne Arles is open again and Wayne is offered

[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.760]
to bring in all the free food that George wants.

[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.320]
Like he used to back in the day.

[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.120]
We used to get all kinds of food all the time.

[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.520]
I can hear you fine.

[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.280]
What is that?

[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:17.180]
That is Joe Rose.

[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.120]
Joe Rose doing interview on his since bleeding on the air.

[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.200]
Yeah, I better go tell those guys.

[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.900]
Yeah, you better tell those guys to shut the pot or do something.

[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.680]
Oh my God.

[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.580]
I don't know Danny.

[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.100]
Who's that?

[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.640]
Danny, if it doesn't make dollars, it doesn't make sense.

[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.700]
Hey, all right.

[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.340]

[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:41.680]
Three, two, one.

[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.460]

[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:54.260]
Come on, Jack.

[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.900]

[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.380]
And he was always dropping F bombs.

[00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:59.000]

[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.540]

[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:27.000]
ready to stab him where the moon don't shine right in the back when you take on the job

[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.620]
I'd stab him in the front anyway I'm not taking a job I don't want it too many headaches

[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:37.640]
and not a big deal with the premium donnis like what what does he have to do besides

[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:41.040]
make a schedule which he can't even do right anyway had George on Monday on the schedule

[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:50.420]
yeah I noticed that and apparently manages at the senior bull he had done this

[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:54.320]
schedule to instead of super bowl he's got the senior bowl today no he's at the

[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:59.240]
super bowl but it had senior ball on there oh the senior balls over with already isn't

[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:05.160]
it yes I don't think there are we had the the north south game the senior

[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:09.160]
bowl the junior bowl the sophomore bowl the toilet bowl I don't think there are

[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.640]
any more college bowl games are there I think that's done that's it it's over you got

[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:17.820]
the purple after the super bowl and then that's the wall of football just vanishes that

[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:22.620]
protective wall that Joe layered around QA and his wall of football I mean I mean is he

[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:26.140]
really that stupid you know I'm pretty well is he that dumb I don't think he's done

[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:35.140]
though why is he doing what he's doing spite maybe Roy says George is a good example of

[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:42.180]
white trailer trash worst part time always sick from drugs wife doesn't work wants things

[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:46.500]
free like a car and lives in a worst part of Hollywood Joe B should lay him off to save

[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:51.020]
money but I forgot he is your ass kisser right that's why he's got his job because he's

[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:59.580]
my ass kisser right I mean the number of times that he agrees with me on anything is so

[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:03.980]
miniscule you could put in a thimble and have room for Joe Bell's ass left over that's

[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:09.220]
how rarely he and I agree on anything but he's my ass kisser at a boy Joe or Roy whoever

[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:14.580]
the hell I was chronic chuck and Chicago says don't bother putting snow tires on the

[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:21.560]
fat keep it in the garage 350 bucks a pop F that I agree screw that that would that would

[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.080]
be a fourteen hundred bucks on that would be a pretty interesting afternoon it would

[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:33.280]
be a good one maybe I'll call my cab guy and see if he wants to drive in this he would

[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:39.180]
go ballistic he go nuts what do you think sure I mean he's a good driver but poor he gets

[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:44.260]
a little bit panicking and it's not see he's like me I'm not concerned in other words it's

[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:48.280]
not a fear of driving in almost any kind of condition it's a fear of the other people

[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:52.320]
out there on the road the crazy people like the one that then you killed me Saturday morning

[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.060]
when I was making my you turned to go get my car washed oh brother came within a foot

[00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:03.300]
of just destroying and ending my life flying out of nowhere anyway Chuck says even with snow

[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.920]
tires with as much power as the vet has and being rear wheel drive I think it will still

[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:13.800]
be a pain in the extra drive in the winter time right be slipping and sliding and dying I

[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:17.080]
drive in the nasty snow here in Chicago Chuck says I have an all wheel drive truck that

[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:21.320]
has traction control basically the car is smart enough to know when tires are slipping and

[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:25.740]
stop sending power to that wheel it's pretty darn easy to drive out these quadro system and Mercedes

[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:30.420]
Formatica are similar I think that was Shannon Sharf that was just interviewing and sounded like his

[00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:38.260]
jive talking Chuck says yeah I had several emails verifying it was Shannon Shannon it's a fraternity

[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:51.300]
of ass kisses is what it is it's really really gay and supposed to be macho man huh they're all

[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:05.200]
didn't catch it last night since the mere mention of her name seems to make your blood boil but

[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:09.440]
Rachel Maddo interviewed Rod Blago she grilled his ass good and was reminiscent of Mike Wallace

[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:14.280]
back in his heyday with 60 minutes MSNBC would be wise to lock her into a lucrative long term

[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:19.380]
contract before the boys at CBS steal her away I still can't understand what your problem is with

[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:24.040]
her anyway I don't like her okay I think she's weak on here very very weak she's a watered down

[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:28.540]
Keith Oberman she's a wannabe I don't like her anyway the past few weeks your shows have been great

[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:33.340]

[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:04.720]
because George isn't here today please do it his best but there's big shoes to fill right

[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:11.600]
absolutely even though George is leading me but that that's just you know people take

[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:15.860]
a cheap shot that's all you're doing on the pole give him an opportunity to take a cheap shot

[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:18.340]
and there they are I'm son of a bitch

[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:27.400]
from the hot ball MSNBC I'm Chris Mathews I gotta be honest with you I feel like a little fluffy

[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:32.660]
white cat and he was just forgiven a warm ball of milk I feel like a completely different

[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:37.580]
person since we have a new president Barack Obama it's just like I know Joe ghost whisperer

[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:42.300]
with Jennifer loves you and the place like me the Melinda Gordon which he looks at Sam she sees

[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:46.640]
a dead husband Jim's face because when he died he jumped in the same spot and tried to parallel

[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:51.880]
because when people look at me they see me Chris Mathews from high ball MSNBC but when I look in the

[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:56.600]
mirror I see a little girl the pink rapper my hair and pig tails looking at Lally Piper like a

[00:57:56.600 --> 00:58:01.500]
two-fifths and conference I feel like Rose from tonne a half man you know Charlie Stalker girlfriend

[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:06.740]
I'm probably in love with a man who doesn't know him alive but it matters not people say to me hey Chris

[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:11.160]
what about the fact that the doubt plans to its lowest level on inauguration day history so what

[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:15.920]
people say to me hey Chris how can we possibly create four million new jobs under the Obama administration

[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:21.760]
I say he can he's a candy man he can take a rainbow rapping in the side so get in the sun and make it

[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:27.540]
grubby lemon pie I feel like a cherry pop type that's been big golden brown the perfection in the

[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:32.600]
coaster oven and he's just sitting on the counter waiting to be consumed I feel like Angelina

[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:38.080]
jolly's underpants it's a new day Sam McRapy economy wars horrible real estate market endless

[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:42.580]
despair and divisiveness but now we have a president who can take tomorrow dip it in a dream

[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:57.520]
separate the sorrow and collect a ball of cream Obama can Obama can he's a candy man I'm Chris

[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:05.020]
with the Obama can he's a candy man

[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:13.340]
those are great anybody doesn't like those Chris Matthews bits I have one thing to say to you

[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:24.160]
okay okay okay you don't like him no I love him they're actually really good no you don't

[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:28.240]
know I can tell by that I can tell by the pregnant pause you don't have to kiss my ass okay

[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:31.580]
now I made those bits go right ahead and say it push up a little bit I actually do like am I

[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:35.520]
watching a facts come through that's whether it's a pause no and what did the same thing no

[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:41.480]
another suggestion for your poll too much one-sided politics oh I see call up Russian tell him

[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:46.700]
about that okay call up a billow and tell him about that too much one-sided politics that's why

[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:50.180]
it's the near-order show it's for my opinions okay it's for what I think and what I care about

[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:55.860]
and where I am where my and that's where it's all about too much one-sided like I'm gonna

[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:59.320]
I'm gonna put a bunch of right wing idiots on here like you guys don't have enough airtime all

[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:04.980]
over the world already God what a miracle at Obama won with all the right wing of idiots controlling

[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:12.240]
all the proper ganda with Fox fake news 24-7 spewing propaganda for trailer trash God

[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:17.760]
with their fair and balanced I thought yeah unfair and unbalanced and a nice job on that

[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.880]
radio show too no wonder billow had to quit the radio show with his point oh oh that James

[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:27.260]
crystal radio man they have got a neck boy I've actually Joe Bell once worked for them because they

[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:31.660]
sure know about numbers that start with a oh that's the area of expertise that's a normal

[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:38.460]
chance good buddies the people with James crystal radio I wonder don't they also own the 640

[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:44.080]
or is that cheap channel I guess that's James crystal they got 640 and 850 and all these other

[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.240]
marginal stations that you put them together and they still got that's that that's quite an

[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:51.480]
accomplishment when you can put four numbers together and they still add up to oh that's great

[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:57.380]
oh he's moist as I agree Rachel's another Keith Oberman with bigger testicles one Keith is

[01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:02.760]
enough that's correct Oberman's great at what he does it's very entertaining he's also one-sided

[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:08.380]
which I like because he's on the side that I'm on and he does some really great stuff and she is

[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:13.280]
like a water down you know it's that same mentality is like um uh who wants to be a millionaire

[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.360]
oh it was a real big head on Thursday let's put it on 10 nights a week and look how well that worked out

[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:25.340]
over saturation baby over exposed that's that whole deal and she doesn't do it well

[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:30.500]
she does it poorly in my estimate I don't like her but there's some of you people oh you got

[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:36.140]
to like her because she did this and she did that and she gave bloggo what for a good I'm real happy

[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:40.900]
that that would that would that would be quite an accomplishment making him look like an idiot

[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:46.520]
that would be like making Sarah look like a moron which I guess made Katie Kurek a great journalist right

[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:53.440]
not Andrew says love the show has always been listening to you since I was a little kid my father

[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.680]

[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:32.620]

[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:36.480]
were on IOD George helped me out with a lot with content and things I finally had to take the page

[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.820]
because of all the a-holes writing to me to complain you don't have any real audio there's no

[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:46.180]
Java etc all these crazy complaints heck I was just doing a little fan site my spirit time stupid

[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:51.060]
idiotic jerks anyway w.w.w.w.d had given the show an internet presence by then so he didn't need

[01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:55.240]
me anymore anyway by the way George is probably doing icy vong hits today go George

[01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:00.660]

[01:04:55.580 --> 01:05:01.520]
the fenders when you're driving so you have no idea whether you're like on the in other words

[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:06.200]
you look at the lines in the road and you can't tell where the car is in relationship to the line

[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:11.640]
like if you're on top of it uh you know I mean yes you can't tell where you are in relationship to

[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.540]
the other cars to the lines on the road or anything there's no sight lines you can't see the

[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:21.100]
fenders what kind of a car is that I mean it's a snazzy you know and it rides great on the like

[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:04.320]
wood by a there's a gas station with a car wash and I run it through the car wash and boy by the

[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:07.900]
time I get the only problem with that is if you drive it on a slushy day by the time you get it

[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:14.480]
home it looks like you never washed it at all because it's about a 25 30 minute drive but the salt

[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:18.400]
will of course the salt's not going to affect it just looks bad but it's not going to affect the

[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:23.480]
vet much because it's not metal it's fiberglass right good thick and deal thank you isn't that correct

[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:28.260]
that is correct but boy what a mess it looked like after oh driving through the snow and slush

[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:33.820]
it's enough to make you want to cry give out of your shrime food borers here with us today always

[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:38.440]

[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:47.080]

potty mouth are kind of guy

[01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:02.360]
Joe says sucks when you give the option of no complaints on your pool because these losers that

[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.920]
don't want to offend you take the easy route out and bail on the pool that's a bunch of crap

[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.240]
maybe there are a lot of people out there who enjoy see this this Joe guy this idiot assumes

[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:16.080]
that everybody's got some complaint stop giving them this option no I'm not going to stop I'll do

[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:19.080]
whatever the hell I want to do in addition to which I didn't make the pool anyway well there are

[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:25.660]
not a mess anyway how would they be scared yeah the purpose of the policy of some reaction from them

[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:30.240]
people who have no complaints are just as interesting as watching paint dry Jesus Christ says Joe

[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:36.560]
maybe Jesus voted a few times on the pool how do you know Joe hey Joe you blow don't you know

[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:44.920]
Joe judge says how are we supposed to slip George drugs with the suit hanging around

[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:49.520]
meaning at Gulf Stream by the way anyone who thinks George's pseudo intellectual needs it only

[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.980]
to go to Gulf Stream and watch him try to juggle his balls during the commercial break ps I hate

[01:10:53.980 --> 01:11:02.760]
Jimmy syphilis good for you Joe wow I'm gonna sneeze come on

[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:13.140]

PR Ralph you you're you're killing me just putting stuff on there just garbage caca

[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:34.800]
Brandon says Brandon this and Brandon that remember that email I was good

[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.780]
if nobody's listening to DA and he's on the air for maybe three four hours what the hell does he

[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:44.580]
talk about I mean you can only talk about sports for about five ten minutes tops how many times

[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:49.800]
you can really say the super bowl is on Sunday I've never listened to him so I I could say how he

[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:54.240]
kills time but it was the same with any K one day I was listening to him for about five minutes

[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.980]
it must have been close to midnight it sounded like he was reading the crossword puzzle from the

[01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:01.780]
newspaper well that's what that was the charm of the eddy case show you never knew when he was

[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:08.120]
going to read those crossword puzzles it's like me reading bedtime stories well they sure screwed him

[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:12.480]
big time well what was the what was the reason for that didn't Joe like any K I'm not really I know

[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:17.820]
he's Jewish that happened like when I first got here so I don't know and Hank I think they were

[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:23.880]
just tired of Hank falling asleep during his show with falling asleep during his show which really

[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:30.260]
happened what that actually happened he fell asleep during the show mid sentence he fell asleep for

[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:34.600]
about 30 seconds and Johnny coped by the wake him up now the great thing is such a pro that he'd

[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:41.200]
popped up said to time and outcute perfectly so you're giving him a big shot and then you're trying

[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:46.740]
to like take it back you you you punch with with one hand and then you like pat on the head with

[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:54.400]
the other one well he could be an old pro old underlying the word old well he party too much too I

[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.500]
think hanging out at the the cheetah party too much so he was sleepy during the show the Humper

[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:05.440]
I think you mean eight too much when you get your blood sugar up above like six seven hundred it

[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:10.720]
started you know you start nodding off speaking to Roger Taylor from Kalamazoo that was a fat guy a fat

[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.600]
young guy maybe he lost all that the poundage over the years I doubted because when you're fat when

[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:21.640]
you're young take it from me you're fat all your life because the Lord works in mysterious ways

[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:28.340]
they'll go make no mistake about it that doesn't give Chris my toop fat Chris yeah you hear that email

[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:32.820]
he sent me yesterday yeah I did kissing and making up and he's gonna be doing the bedtime

[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:37.720]
stories and on the side in March and courtes as an idiot and yada yada you like that you know stuff we

[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:44.700]
already know and about how he can't stand working that but you know it's better than being on the

[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:50.800]
street midnight till 5 a.m. or 6 whenever the hell he's done how's that show going to 5 to 6 with

[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:55.060]
Jesse Agler Jesse's really good Jesse is good why why the hell they got him buried between why don't

[01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:00.040]
he put him on from 2 to 4 I don't know how much he could get a number in there from 2 to 4 as opposed

[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:04.660]
to these other stiff they keep sticking there you know who think that they're like that maybe he

[01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:10.700]
should be to play by play for the hurricanes is he gonna what was he gonna did you just drop a

[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:16.700]
little bomb on us no but he's good enough to well his penis face getting candor what that's that

[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:21.280]
was the rumor not I haven't heard that Zagak he's getting blown out no way and the definite rumor

[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:25.560]
that Jimmy Cifalitic is getting blown out with it often games is that true that'd be nice but no

[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:33.320]
I haven't heard that you haven't heard it no certainly well deserved I'll tell you that oh and he

[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:40.640]
gives the ball to number 83 and what was he going and what's he doing oh my god Jimmy you are so bad

[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:45.560]
so he is the epitome of what the jacquist he's all about that Kosella warned the world about

[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:50.160]
just like when ice now warned the world about the military industrial complex howard Kosella

[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.720]
100 years ago warned everybody about the jacque accuracy and how they were destroying

[01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:58.560]
the fine art of sportscasting and they've done they haven't just destroyed it they've butchered it

[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:06.840]

like three weeks you know the problem some of your listeners have with commercials on the

[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:28.060]
replay shows depends on which browser they're using if I listen to it on my laptop of

[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:32.200]
explorer you cannot fast forward through the commercials if you listen with Firefox you can fast

[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:37.500]
forward the windows media players different between Firefox and Explorer hope all is well into

[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:40.960]

[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:07.720]
played makes listening to the incessant PSA's online over and over worth here that bit okay good

[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:13.300]
I'm glad to hear Mike couldn't couldn't help but do the thing about the incessant PSA's on the

[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:17.040]
internet nothing we can do about it okay it's just what it is actually I've been working on that

[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:21.100]
have you yes and what do you what did you I thought you're not I don't want to be the PD

[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:24.920]
well I don't but I don't believe by the way it's trying to take over Clevver's job we hope that

[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:28.720]
he succeeds I just don't want people going crazy because it was horrible so I'm starting to

[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:33.400]
slowly fix it how are you doing that by adding new elements so they don't hear the same PSA's

[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:38.720]
in the one promo that paid four thousand times in a couple of months good so it's getting better

[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:43.120]

[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:48.340]
pretty good job on that for about two days and then they all came back yeah yeah what still

[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:54.800]
trying to work on that too have you heard from your good friend Dick Purtin from Detroit says the

[01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:00.020]
fake Larry King no I have not not in years still on the year he's still doing great he's a great talent

[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:08.400]
oh Brandon finally a bit about those damn spots on the stream see anyways I always like how Corvette's

[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.900]
look but being six one and about two hundred pounds I'm just not comfortable driving them

[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:17.700]
that's why for me I usually only will drive an SUV or a nice sized car a vet is just too compact

[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:23.380]
do you ever get that thing that vets were for like little people am I a little people no I'm five

[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:27.300]
nine I weigh a hundred eighty nine pounds yeah it's not like six one two hundred pounds as a giant

[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:35.500]
either no a slipper like you can't afford to vet that's the problem Brandon all he's the manager

[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:39.560]
in his orifice who is this Brandon and why you talking about my my my my my my I thought I heard

[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:44.740]
the new Roger show that that that email was hysterical that all the complaint ones are hysterical

[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:50.080]
all of them each and everyone because you know they're listening every minute of every hour of

[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:54.620]
every day of every week of every month of every year you know that am I right yes

[01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:00.540]
seven hundred eighty three votes on the pool I think we can top nine hundred today that would be

[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:05.060]
pretty good that would be a real feather in your craft oh yeah what would your critique be if

[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:09.980]
Neil allowed it on the year that is so worded so badly Charlie B you owe me an apology Charlie

[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:16.600]

[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:59.860]
they do have some spade uh paid spots but not that some what some spade

[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:04.820]

[01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:08.400]
bava lost vengeance i do believe his legal name he had it changed

[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:12.700]
an after hearing that flee was almost sued by bava it means he's a big hypocrite because he goes on

[01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:16.800]
and complains how people can sue him for whatever reason god i hope he gets taken off air he says

[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:21.680]
your close personal friend Brandon pappa papa papa ppe pteipp爸爸

[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.120]
But at least he responds, you know what I'm saying?

[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:27.420]
At least he sent us stuff as opposed to the majority of people out there who wouldn't

[01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:31.020]
take ten seconds to send us their very best or their very worst.

[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.640]
So I'm a vent who's a real chronic idiot.

[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:38.220]
I've been listening to you often on again for weeks and all you talk about is some Joe

[01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:38.500]
Bell.

[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:41.920]
Isn't broadcasting one of ones to refresh the idea?

[01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:43.120]
Who is Joe Effing Bell?

[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.260]
He's our general managers if you don't already know.

[01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.020]
This is probably from your friend Joe Bell.

[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:48.800]
What does he do?

[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:49.440]
Not much.

[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:53.280]
All I hear is you stomping on this guy saying, you fairy.

[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:57.240]
So for all listeners you confuse with Joe Bell talk and since you don't even give him a chance

[01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:59.400]
to defend himself, Neil, let us know who this guy is.

[01:30:59.480 --> 01:30:59.640]
You hate.

[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:00.760]
He's our general manager.

[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:01.340]
You idiot.

[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.260]
And tell Georgie to feel better.

[01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:04.540]
Grow a seconder in your keep.

[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:05.520]
Love in the hate, Joe.

[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:06.720]
Love the five guys.

[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:07.700]
Oh, it's Joe.

[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:10.360]
Joe 316, he writes on it.

[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:11.460]
Just all over the place.

[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:12.460]
Let's simple them.

[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:17.220]
So I guess we get to your shan old tomorrow.

[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:19.020]
I'm going to be, oh, here we go.

[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:20.760]
Mr. Radio about flea.

[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:21.260]
I agree.

[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:22.700]
Flea sounds great on the year.

[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:24.740]
Can you ask him what station he worked in in Tampa?

[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.780]
Did he work at 93.3 FLC or 98 rock?

[01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:33.400]
Tell him, Brent Smart Guy for being a Tampa Redneck.

[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:34.080]
What does that mean?

[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:34.840]
Not sure.

[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:36.340]
But I worked at 98 rock.

[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:38.840]
What name did Lee use on the air?

[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:40.540]
Lead Daniels.

[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:41.780]
Lead Daniels.

[01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:42.380]
Yeah, that's my middle name.

[01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:43.420]
What is that a phony name?

[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:43.820]
Oh, yeah.

[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:44.660]
Like Neil Rogers.

[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:45.140]
Uh-huh.

[01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:47.040]
Neil, did you hear that error?

[01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:50.200]
Jamaica will be canceling their service to Miami at 1.10 or 20 years ago.

[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:51.260]
They had seven flights a day.

[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:53.980]
They'll be keeping their Toronto and FLL flights.

[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:58.240]
This is indicative of the general trend over the past 10 years where carabiners and African

[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:00.280]
Americans in general being pushed out of the Dave County.

[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:04.320]
Last year was a record for MIF, past year traffic, but most of the growth coming from Europe

[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.440]
and South American flights.

[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:08.480]
Well, so what does that mean?

[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.900]
Here's one from Mr. Radio, Mr. Groupy.

[01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:15.380]
What does DJ Holliday do?

[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.920]
I don't even know who the hell that is.

[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:18.360]
He's the production director.

[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:20.380]
Yeah, that's what he does.

[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.340]
And I don't know.

[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:22.820]
What else?

[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:23.140]
Good.

[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:26.040]
God, Mr. Radio, some of you people would just know.

[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.460]
I have no life whatsoever.

[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:27.760]

[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:28.820]
Just make me want to conquer.

[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:30.280]
Scary.

[01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:35.720]
Well, speaking of Tampa, and you well know this having worked over there and lived there,

[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:38.720]
there's lipsticks and center folds in the blitz cabaret.

[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.760]
There's diamond dolls and bare assets in the Wild Gentleman's Club.

[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:47.100]
In fact, there are by one count 43 strip clubs in the Tampa metro area, one for each Super Bowl.

[01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:47.640]
Oh, yeah.

[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:52.220]
And the week of Super Bowl, this one is the Tampa's not the nightlife, what Black Friday

[01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:53.560]
is to America shopping malls.

[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:57.520]
All the exotic dancing joints have earned Tampa a body reputation.

[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.860]
The Lads magazine, the Maxime, you can put it in its top ten list of best US party cities

[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:05.560]
a couple of years ago, based mostly on the dozens of night spots to see naked or nearly

[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:06.160]
naked women.

[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.040]
How about mom's weaners?

[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:08.680]
Is that still there?

[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:10.060]
Oh, yeah, and the Odyssey also.

[01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:14.000]
Now, but at least one spot planning to have a talent in the parking lot to handle the

[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.140]
overflow, free spending tourist, locals expect a profit mightily through kickoff Sunday evening.

[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:22.540]
Based on what we did last Super Bowl in 2001, the numbers will quadruple during that weekend,

[01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:27.640]
says Nick Polafroni, general manager of 2001 Odyssey, a landmark club known for the

[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:30.980]
spaceship-shaped VIP room rising from the top of the building.

[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:35.780]
Across the street is mom's Venus, a joint listed among the best strip clubs in the world

[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:38.500]
by uses of a website called the Ultimate Strip Club List.

[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:42.900]
The two off-scale clubs, walking distance from Raymond James Stadium where the Arizona

[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:45.520]
Cardinals will play the Steelers, have been fixtures for decades.

[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:49.900]
Tampa has a reputation for having the most strip clubs in the most girls who are a lot of

[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:54.240]
fun, says a 25-year-old exotic dancer named Claudia, who left a usual gig in Las Vegas,

[01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:56.340]
uh, for work at the Super Bowl week here.

[01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:59.780]
She has their nice name not to be used to save her family and any embarrassment.

[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:05.340]
Claudia has worked for previous Super Bowls and expects to make two grand a day at 2001 Odyssey.

[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:05.720]
Wow.

[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:11.920]
Most clubs treat the dancers as independent contractors who play a fat fleet, a fat fleet,

[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.380]
a flat fee to the house and keep the rest.

[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:16.920]
That's true.

[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:19.400]
It's so crazy, everybody is in such a party mood.

[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:21.220]
She says it's a whole new level of everything.

[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:25.120]
The clubs have been busy auditioning more dancers and upgrading their interiors,

[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:27.000]
some actually stay open 24 hours.

[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:31.720]
The Tampa Tribune added a helpful feature to its website listing the 43 strip clubs and

[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:35.800]
allowing Super Bowl visitors to search for such information as the cover charge and rest code.

[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.280]
Tired of Tampa's sleazy reputation, local lawmakers passed an anti-laptance ordinance before

[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:45.660]
the last Super Bowl here in 2001, making it a misdemeanor offense for dancers to come within

[01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:46.460]
six feet of patrons.

[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:50.520]
The measure got a lot of publicity, but police didn't arrest anybody during Super Bowl week.

[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.320]
Police spoke to women Andrea Davis's offices, one,

[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:56.600]
patroller clubs looking for dancers who get too close, but there'll be a large,

[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:58.780]
large, to investigate if somebody calls in a complaint.

[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:03.160]
Our primary focus during the Super Bowl is going to be public safety, she says.

[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:07.680]
Bob Buckhorn, former city councilman who pushed the six foot ordinance to lament that adult

[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:10.540]
entertainment industry is ingrained in the fabric of this community.

[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:14.620]
The point of the law, he says, was to attack prostitution and prevent other crime by trying to

[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:18.080]
keep men away from those places. He wishes it was more aggressively enforced.

[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:20.360]
It's like cockroaches, Buckhorn says.

[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:24.120]
If you don't stay on top of it, it will infect and run you over, and that's exactly what happened.

[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:29.240]
For the city's promoters, Tampa's image is the lap dance capital of America is not exactly

[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.400]
something that's out in the glossy brochures.

[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.660]
Well, excuse me, huh?

[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:38.980]
When it's out, don't tout it out.

[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:45.740]
Yeah, the owner of the Magnus Venus Rand from Mayor at one time in Tampa.

[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:47.320]
Yeah, and didn't win.

[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:47.700]

[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:52.160]
So we get to your channel tomorrow, I guess, if we tune in early enough.

[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:55.460]
All right, make sure I make sure you leave me a memo and miss that.

[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.020]
God, 800 more votes on the pool.

[01:35:59.080 --> 01:35:59.960]
I think we can go home now.

[01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:02.160]
I think we can leave.

[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:10.040]
Oishmoi, creepy, creepy Carl Robles, sumi 8x10, receiving a 9x3 in his number two,

[01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:12.120]
and I say plunge on, so mate, plunge on.

[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:14.260]
Very clever, not.

[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:20.760]
The stuff that comes in on these emails is just, I don't know whether it's scream or peel a banana.

[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.480]
If you catch my drift, yes, you can't see it.

[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:26.860]
Oh, it's caught.

[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:30.200]
Well, during the break, I gotta go out there and check and see if it's still snowing like a son of a

[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:30.420]
bitch.

[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:33.740]
So I can make my plans with a hot machine.

[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:37.560]
Anybody have a heart or a liver?

[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:41.900]
The number one problem facing sport host today is getting laid.

[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:43.420]
Hmm, I don't know.

[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:45.340]
I want to touch a girl.

[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:50.040]
Yeah, it's trip joints in warehouses that maintain confidence in your manly hood.

[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:54.960]
But when you're gonna get some on your own merit, without having to lay out expendable cash,

[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.180]
well now's your chance.

[01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:59.260]
With sport hall radios, white men in the keys contest.

[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:04.940]
Look for the life-size bust of Galdese head urinal cake made from the wholesome goodness of

[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:06.280]
genuine urinal cake.

[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:09.360]
While in the urinal, you'll find the URL.

[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.660]
Then enter it on your cell.

[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:16.640]
Enter username, vagrant password, the glitch.

[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.000]
They wait for your chance to win.

[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.480]
Wow, another winner.

[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:25.120]
White men in the keys.

[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:28.780]
On five six, oh, ever use you man.

[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:31.180]
If it's right.

[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:33.840]
1215 and 560 WQM.

[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:35.040]
Happy a Wednesday to you.

[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:37.420]
So what's the weather like there right now?

[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:38.000]
It's sunny.

[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:38.700]
Yeah, it's nice.

[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:40.660]
Sunny 75, 78.

[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:42.120]
Yeah, lower 70.

[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:43.200]
72.

[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:43.940]
Sounds good.

[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:46.380]
I don't know what the temperature is here.

[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:49.260]
Now we're getting 25 centimeters of snow today by the end of the day.

[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:49.840]
How much that is?

[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:50.540]
That's 10 inches.

[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:51.460]
Wow.

[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:55.720]
Minus five, which I think is like about, I don't know, 25, 26.

[01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:56.700]
There are votes.

[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:02.700]
All right, so essentially we will continue to see this activity until about 8 pm this evening.

[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:06.640]
And generally up to 15 centimeters of snow is possible through the downtown core.

[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:10.340]
Once you get into Grimsby St. Catherine's, yes, a little bit more generally.

[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:13.860]
Who without wants to get into St. Catherine's?

[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:15.820]
Garden City racetrack, harness track.

[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:18.460]
It's actually 77 here right now.

[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:19.140]
77.

[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:21.000]
Is it really?

[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:21.620]
Yep.

[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:22.560]
How do you know that?

[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:23.280]
Because 77.

[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:24.680]
I just want to say.

[01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:27.080]
You looked at what?

[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:30.180]
CBS4 website for the current weather conditions.

[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:31.720]
CBS4 website.

[01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:33.940]
Oh, when did that all start?

[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:36.080]
That crap NBC6 and CBS4.

[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:37.240]
When did that crap start?

[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:38.120]
I don't know.

[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.360]
Why can't you just say channel four or channel six?

[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:41.440]
Whatever channel you were on?

[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:47.740]
And by the way, your roasting is going to be too happy with you being on channel looking on channel four's website.

[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:49.220]
Or did I say four on that six?

[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.520]
Yeah, NBC6.

[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:51.620]
That's the Joe Rose channel.

[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:52.080]
That's right.

[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:56.000]
Where they have to have like a special camera to get all of his big head on here.

[01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:58.760]
What was that crap that email had yesterday?

[01:38:59.000 --> 01:38:59.460]
I hate everybody.

[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:00.700]
You hate all the people you work with.

[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:01.780]
I like Joe just fine.

[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:02.780]
I like Mad Dog a lot.

[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:03.840]
Yeah, he's great.

[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:05.920]
Who else?

[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:10.120]
I used to like Eddie Kale up, but he's not there anymore.

[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:11.700]
Like Hank a whole lot still do.

[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:14.220]
They sure skim though.

[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:15.240]
They sure screwed him over.

[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:18.040]
So you tell me he fell asleep on the air for like 30 seconds.

[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:20.140]
How can we never heard that story before?

[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:21.140]
I'll have to find out.

[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:21.420]
I'll have to find out.

[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:23.540]
The minus three today, 26.

[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:24.680]
I'll have to find the audio.

[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:25.620]
I think I have it somewhere.

[01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:28.000]
You have the audio of Hank falling asleep on the air.

[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:30.620]
That would get us a 90's year today if you could find that.

[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:32.580]
I'll see if I can get it.

[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:35.420]
Oh, God.

[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:38.620]
Sounds to me like you're trying to embarrass the Humper.

[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:40.240]
Just to suck up to Joe Bell.

[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:41.480]
No, that's what it sounds like.

[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:42.820]
No, no, I just think it's funny.

[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.280]
I have Hank's interview with Will Clark

[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:46.780]
where he thought he was talking to somebody else.

[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:48.040]
Oh, I've heard that too.

[01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:48.560]
That's classic.

[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:49.340]
Is it?

[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:49.680]
Yeah.

[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.580]
Oh, I knocked it off.

[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:52.820]
I got so carried away.

[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.380]
I knocked it off the on the airline.

[01:39:57.260 --> 01:39:57.920]
Where is it?

[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:00.560]
I know, but I remember I go back a long way

[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:02.300]
to the when the Yankees first came down here.

[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:05.100]
And they had trained all those years in St. Petersburg

[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:08.100]
and what a culture shock it was for them to leave St.

[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:10.000]
Petersburg and come to Fort Lauderdale with it.

[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:12.880]
Which at that time was where spring break was happening.

[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:15.120]
You know, in St. Petersburg, you know what was happening there.

[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:17.600]
Well, because you've been to Spring Training in that city.

[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:18.640]
There was nothing there, right?

[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:22.240]
Well, I was in poor Charlotte for five years.

[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:24.500]
When you were with the...

[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:25.480]
Did you ever go to St. Petersburg?

[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:26.400]
Nope.

[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.060]
For Spring Training, never did.

[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:28.560]
Nope.

[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:29.020]
Nope.

[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:32.780]
Nine years before that, I was in Arizona.

[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:33.620]
Yeah.

[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.500]
Right, with the Giants.

[01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:36.100]
Yep.

[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:39.340]
How is it coming over to the American League?

[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:40.580]
You looking forward to it?

[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.340]
Been in the American League for five years now.

[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:43.960]
Yeah.

[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:47.680]
So I'm not unfamiliar with it.

[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:50.640]
I'm looking forward to just starting with a new team here.

[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:02.660]
That was funny.

[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:04.180]
Now that's bad.

[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:05.480]
Why would you play something like that?

[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:06.120]
That was terrible.

[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:10.360]
Oh, boy.

[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:14.160]
So do you find that other thing about hang falling asleep on a year?

[01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:16.300]
No, but I'll try to get it in the break.

[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.200]
Oh, that's bad.

[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:23.260]
And Hank is a great guy.

[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:24.220]
You know, I mean, you know Hank.

[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:24.980]
Yeah, he's great.

[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:26.700]
He's old a little bit.

[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:29.800]
And over time's on the year where he was a little listless.

[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:31.440]
And when they put him on in the morning,

[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:33.660]
there was the worst mistake how they could have done that.

[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:36.700]
I mean, immediately everyone, you know,

[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:39.740]
those of us who have done mornings know that there's a certain energy level

[01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:42.900]
you have to have to get up that early number one and then do a do morning,

[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:44.760]
you know, and be awake and alert and alive.

[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.080]
And that crossover thing that clearance came up with with me and Hank,

[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:52.080]
oh, that was just killer.

[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:54.080]
Did you hear that?

[01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:54.860]
Yes.

[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:02.080]
And it really just bugged the hell out of me because I knew that it was

[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:05.900]
because it was accomplishing nothing because the people who liked Hank

[01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:07.580]
had already been listening to him all morning long.

[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:10.220]
And the people who liked me wanted to hear me.

[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:10.800]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:12.400]
Hank was much better in the afternoons.

[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:12.840]
That's for sure.

[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:13.560]
Exactly.

[01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:15.880]
We had it going, man.

[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:17.280]
We had the mad dog two to four.

[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:19.580]
We had that crossover hour with the two of them four to five.

[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.680]
We had the Humper five to seven by himself.

[01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:22.680]
And we had it going.

[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.400]
We were kicking big smelly ass.

[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:30.980]
And now we just handed the ball over to La Bastard there in the afternoon

[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:33.020]
because he's not doing strictly a sports show.

[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:35.500]
And you keep telling me that you told Joe Bell this morning

[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:37.620]
in times there to go to Joe Bell again with that email.

[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:38.980]
And he won't listen.

[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:40.140]
He won't listen.

[01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:44.440]
The top rated shows on this station and across the street are the shows

[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.380]
that are mostly non-sports.

[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.220]
I mean, I don't really know what La Bastard does.

[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:51.140]
But I guess, you know, a lot of comedy, a lot of off-the-wall stuff.

[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:52.380]
Right?

[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:52.820]
Yes.

[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:54.700]
Not pure sports.

[01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:55.420]
Not give me the ball.

[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:55.860]
Give me the ball.

[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:57.060]
Shanon, Shanon.

[01:42:57.300 --> 01:43:00.240]
You know, I say, schmidon, Shanon.

[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.140]
That's what I say.

[01:43:01.340 --> 01:43:02.920]
I wouldn't shmit on the best part of Shanon.

[01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:05.440]
I wouldn't shmit on the best part of him if I could find it.

[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:09.680]
I mean, don't these people have ears?

[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:13.300]
Can't they hear when somebody doesn't sound like they belong on the ear?

[01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:17.260]
Just because a guy used to take showers naked with a bunch of other guys

[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:20.020]
and word jockstrap, does that make him qualify to be a boardcaster?

[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:22.720]
I mean, I know I keep beating that into the ground,

[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:24.320]
but it just frosts my ass.

[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:28.300]
Growing up and listening to all the great broadcasters through the years,

[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:30.040]
my god, there were so many of them.

[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:34.000]
Chuck Thompson and Harry and Mel

[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:38.120]
Ernie Harwell, Gaudi,

[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.580]
Gives Chandley and Cleveland.

[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:45.020]
There were just a genuine real, and these weren't jocks or ex-jocks.

[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:46.940]
These were guys who were radio and television people.

[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:48.400]
These were broadcasters.

[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:51.420]
Not just guys that used to take naked showers together

[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:53.540]
and slap each other on the ass in the locker room

[01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:55.760]
and god only knows maybe do a little bit more than that.

[01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:57.740]
You know what I mean?

[01:43:58.040 --> 01:43:58.820]
Yeah, like that.

[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:02.660]
That's one thing, Al Goldstein,

[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:05.160]
all his other problems.

[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:07.660]
One thing he was right about the sports fraternity.

[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:09.720]
That's a gay club you moron.

[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:09.960]
Right.

[01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:11.100]
Amen.

[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:16.040]
Let's give Al two to four and see how many days before we get sued a few times.

[01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:20.740]
By the way, Joyce is slowly catching up to George on the pole.

[01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:22.280]
Oh, is she?

[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:22.620]
Yeah.

[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:23.480]
And that was the late edition.

[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:25.220]
And that's my bad.

[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:26.080]
I should have had you edit.

[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:28.040]
Well, I did as soon as we sat down this morning.

[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:29.620]
As soon as you finally showed up.

[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:31.940]
And by the way, thanks for being here today because George is out sick.

[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:32.680]
No problem.

[01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:33.920]
Because if you weren't here today,

[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.000]
god only knows what kind of crap they would have said.

[01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:37.100]
Maybe the beast again.

[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:40.760]
Maybe that's Clarence's favorite trick as to what his boyfriend on there.

[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:43.660]
And the beast was okay on Friday.

[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:44.600]
The beast was with us.

[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.540]
So when George was out there at Goldstein, he was all right.

[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:47.740]
He kept his mouth shut.

[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:51.960]
Although he occasionally slips some things out that I guess is supposed to be

[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:53.900]
like to think about the station moving down the street.

[01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:56.660]
I think that's supposed to be a big secret.

[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:57.180]
It is.

[01:44:59.060 --> 01:44:59.940]
Well, I don't know.

[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:03.600]
What would your critique be if Neil allowed it on the air?

[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:04.920]
Well, Neil is allowing it on the air.

[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:06.420]
That's why we're taking the pole, Charlie B.

[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:08.560]
I noticed Charlie B hasn't emailed me again and say,

[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:09.480]
oh, I apologize.

[01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:10.500]
That was really stupid.

[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:12.900]
Oh, here's the fake Adam Kirschner.

[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:14.720]
I'm loving Flea, what a breath of fresh air.

[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:18.000]
Ask him what he knows about Cracker Jack Harris being canned from WFLA.

[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:18.900]
He was canned.

[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:21.620]
Well, he was on there a long time.

[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:23.720]
Probably making too much money.

[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:24.560]
Was he?

[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:25.060]
Probably.

[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:29.040]
I told him I was going to sneeze.

[01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:29.520]
There it was.

[01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:30.080]
An hour later.

[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:31.180]
I didn't say which hour.

[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:39.580]
Alan Israel wants to talk with you about Yahoo messenger about using an I don't want to.

[01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:41.920]
In fact, Yahoo makes me nauseous.

[01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:43.140]
I get more spam on Yahoo.

[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:44.880]
Oh, Mr. Radio again,

[01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:48.940]
leaded in mornings with Maria Stone, Harrison Dangler,

[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:51.060]
and Bob Narlie on 98 Rock.

[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:51.740]
That is correct.

[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:55.620]
Well, he's so in other words, he's asking if he remembers Joel Tate.

[01:45:57.100 --> 01:45:57.720]
Say you well.

[01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:58.560]
What kind of a name is that?

[01:45:58.660 --> 01:45:59.280]
Joel Tate?

[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:01.960]
I don't remember, but my memory is now what it used to be.

[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:02.240]
No.

[01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:07.880]
It's like this Mr. Radio and all these other people like him like to fake Alice Rantel,

[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:08.940]
which I'm sure is the same person.

[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:11.140]
It's like they're writing a book about old time radio.

[01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:12.540]
Boring.

[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:13.760]
Talk about boring.

[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:16.020]
Oh, here we go.

[01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:17.140]
You're my bitches back.

[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:17.380]
Good.

[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:18.160]
I always love it.

[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:21.940]
God between the reading of Brandon's ass-stucking emails and you're

[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:22.960]
complaining, so I'm going to go nuts.

[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:24.200]
Again, with the jolly joe bell.

[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:27.180]
Man, I remember when you used to get close to 2,000 votes on your polls.

[01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:30.400]
Without having to combine polls, I know they took away farts and

[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:33.220]
veded curtain and they bitch slapped you with a bunch of restrictions.

[01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:34.200]
But come on.

[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:37.820]
Not too long ago, you still had an easy 1,500 votes per poll per day.

[01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:39.980]
You had topics and took calls and read articles.

[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:42.580]
You didn't put people to sleep with your bedtime stories.

[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:43.700]
Oh, I read articles, though.

[01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:45.540]
What the hell's going on here?

[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:48.000]
Take the damn calls already.

[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:49.180]
You can't forget the love of God.

[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:50.260]
Just keep mailing it in.

[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:52.300]
Flee if I were you at state.

[01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:53.800]
You should your name and flee for your life.

[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:54.100]
Bat.

[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:58.660]
Go talk to someone to get George on his own show and you can be a sidekick.

[01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:00.820]
You can call it the spikingly Daniel show.

[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:01.700]
That's catchy.

[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:02.760]
Shut up, Rogers.

[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:03.260]
Bat.

[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:05.140]
Says you're my bitch.

[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:05.660]
Wow.

[01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:07.400]
One of my very favorite emailers.

[01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:07.940]
Very angry.

[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:09.320]
No, not angry.

[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:10.660]
Just fake.

[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:15.640]
See, if you take any of this stuff literally, you'd never, you'd go home and

[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:18.560]
you'd never, you'd lock the door from the inside and you'd never go outside again.

[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:21.660]
You'd pull like a little doggy door underneath and have like

[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:25.060]
delivery, you know, all your food delivered.

[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:32.160]
But I think he serves a purpose, though, because he's representative of an awful lot of what's

[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:32.660]
there, you know?

[01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:37.120]
I mean, I'm reading articles about how everybody is so much happier now that bushes out

[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:41.400]
and Obama's in and we got rid of the eight years of misery even though we got a depression going on.

[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.280]
But they're a lot of happy people.

[01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:45.580]
Most of them, however, are not in South Florida.

[01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:56.620]
Well, the rush limbo with your wife, friends, on what's the left of comedy picotags called the

[01:47:57.380 --> 01:47:59.920]
Donning of a new generation?

[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.640]
Well, you know what, my suffocates?

[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:03.220]
I say good.

[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:08.420]
Now, you're going to get a chance firsthand to witness all that I've been warning you about.

[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:10.460]
They want it all, but okay.

[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:11.780]
They got them.

[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:15.340]
And today, the market fell at another 300 points.

[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:19.980]
He's no friend of corporate high friends and that means he's no friend of mine.

[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.440]
Mark my words, my friends.

[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.620]
He's going to plunge us into the dank and dirty dark-nissled freedom and prosperity.

[01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:31.820]
Yes, my friends, I'm going to watch you suffer from the comfort of my luxurious mansion in Bomb Beach.

[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:35.880]
A tell you, my friends, a high tone like that shouldn't be serving in the White House.

[01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:38.060]
He should be serving drinks on a train.

[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:39.860]
He he he he.

[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:43.600]
Hey, no, no, no, what are you people doing to my plus or your point of view?

[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:45.200]
I be not working at home.

[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:47.120]
All right, possession on this stuff, pal.

[01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:48.100]
You've got to leave.

[01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:50.240]
You've got to listen.

[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:55.020]
I'm a pure channel cool, little boy.

[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:56.860]
Yeah, well, you failed.

[01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:58.440]
And you're not.

[01:48:58.800 --> 01:48:58.960]
No.

[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:01.580]
Come on, so let's go.

[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:03.740]
No, no, what the hell?

[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:07.540]
I'm afraid of people.

[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.460]
That's why I'm really seen in public, you know.

[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:12.600]
I'm afraid of people.

[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:15.440]
I'm afraid of people.

[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:16.620]
You hear this?

[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:18.140]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:19.220]
I don't cry.

[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:22.680]
I'm afraid of people.

[01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:27.900]
I'm afraid of people.

[01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:30.620]
I'm afraid of people.

[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.700]
Okay, 1230 is 560 WQM.

[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:35.920]
Maybe you ought to take a pulse since you can't get clearances, John.

[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:37.600]
Maybe you take over George's job.

[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:40.120]
No, you can't afford the pay cut, though.

[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:42.480]
No, it actually helped me be a pay increase, but that's okay.

[01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:43.220]
It would be?

[01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:44.100]
George is my boy.

[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:44.960]
I wouldn't stab him in the back.

[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:49.280]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:55.280]
Oh, you would stab your grandma in the back if you could accomplish something by doing it.

[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:57.100]
I can just tell.

[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:00.920]
I don't know you that well, but I can just tell from talking to you that you're that kind of a guy.

[01:50:01.020 --> 01:50:01.640]
Wow, thanks.

[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:03.800]
If you got a grandma, she's still a liar.

[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:04.380]
No, she's dead.

[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:05.980]
You're both dead?

[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:06.340]
Yeah.

[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:07.900]
Oh, yeah.

[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:08.480]
Mine too.

[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:09.300]
That's a shame.

[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:10.300]
I'm an orphan.

[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:13.000]
You do realize that my parents are dead, my grandparents are dead.

[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:14.380]
Most of my relatives are dead.

[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:14.800]
Me too.

[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:15.960]
I'm like an orphan.

[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:18.660]
I don't even know if my relatives are dead or alive.

[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:21.160]
And quite frankly, I guess they don't care what...

[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:23.100]
I guess they know I'm alive because I'm on the air, you know.

[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:28.740]
Yeah, I guess it all depends on just how much you're into family.

[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:33.700]
See, people give me crap because I've never been a family person,

[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:34.380]
if you know what I mean.

[01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:37.080]
I'm not talking about, you know, married with kids

[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:38.140]
and that immediate family.

[01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:41.060]
And I'm talking about, you know, parents and your extended family.

[01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:43.340]
Right.

[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:44.520]
Are you a big family person?

[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:45.620]
No, not really.

[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:48.740]
And, uncles, brothers, sisters, cousins.

[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:49.300]
No.

[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:54.560]
Well, that's because I'm a heartless bastard who hates everybody.

[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:55.480]
You do understand that.

[01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:56.440]
That's what they tell me.

[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:57.520]
That's what the audience tells me.

[01:50:57.840 --> 01:50:59.380]
They know me really well, not.

[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:03.260]
That's one of the things that I'll never, ever...

[01:51:03.260 --> 01:51:05.840]
I can't relate to it and I can't even begin to understand it.

[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:08.060]
The idea that because you watch somebody on TV

[01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:09.340]
or you listen to somebody on radio,

[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:11.400]
you think that you know them personally.

[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:14.860]
Well, I love it around here because everybody's afraid to ask you anything.

[01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:16.740]
It's like, what do you think is going to happen?

[01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:17.560]
He's in Toronto.

[01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:19.560]
What is he going to say is no and call you an idiot?

[01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:22.900]
Everybody here is scared of you.

[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:25.680]
God, Mr. Radio has outdone himself.

[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:31.960]
This is the all-time groupie email.

[01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:36.520]
Fort Myers, Fall Arbitron Ratings 1999.

[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:39.100]
Persons 2554.

[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:42.140]
Oh, my God.

[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:45.340]
Number one, W-A-V-V.

[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:47.860]
I mean, this is a great interest to the audience.

[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:49.420]
I'm sure the Fort Myers Ratings,

[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:50.760]
but this is from when you were on the year.

[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:51.100]
Right.

[01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:54.700]
13.1 share, W-A-V-V-V.

[01:51:54.980 --> 01:51:56.440]
Listening in big band, easy listening.

[01:51:56.620 --> 01:51:58.300]
That figure's out of old parts over there.

[01:51:58.700 --> 01:51:59.460]
Music put the nearly dead.

[01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:02.820]
W-X-R-K, one of these numbers.

[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:04.320]
Oh, I see.

[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:07.500]
1177 for W-A-V-V-V-V-H-7 for Howard Stern.

[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:12.360]
W-X-R-K, that's K-Rox call letters.

[01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:12.720]
Yes.

[01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:15.200]
Well, how can they have the same call letters and four Myers?

[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:20.540]
That's just like when they were simulcasting me and four Myers,

[01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.340]
and they were calling it W-Q-A-M.

[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:23.400]
You run in four Myers?

[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:24.180]
Yeah.

[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:24.980]
I didn't know that.

[01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:27.500]
Oh, yeah, for quite a while for, I don't know, two, three years.

[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:28.900]
What years were that?

[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:32.880]
I would say the first years of Q-A-M, like,

[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:36.960]
98, 99, 2000.

[01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:38.300]
Wow, I was there, I didn't even know.

[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:39.700]
Well, no, there you go.

[01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:40.560]
So you could have been listening.

[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:43.380]
Could have picked up some pointers,

[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:45.340]
could have stolen some material like Paul and Ron.

[01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:46.400]
Well, not only was that there,

[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:47.920]
but I worked for the company and still didn't know.

[01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:48.840]
Yeah.

[01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:50.560]
Well, that's, you know, that's them.

[01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:54.020]
W-X-K-V-8-1, Randy and Melody.

[01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:56.960]
W-D-L-Z-6-1, the breakfast bunch.

[01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:01.000]
W-W-W-G-R-5-4, country, wink, 5.4,

[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:05.680]
Bennett and Bunch, W-J-V-X-5-1, Lee Daniels.

[01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:06.080]
Yeah.

[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:07.260]
But that's 2554.

[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:08.800]
We were in 18 to 34-year-old station.

[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:12.600]
And this is persons 2554 men and women.

[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:14.380]
We were number one persons 18 to 34.

[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:14.920]
Woo!

[01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:15.700]
I know.

[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:20.640]
W-C-K-T-4-7, Rick McGee.

[01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:21.620]
Can't country.

[01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:28.020]
News 39, W-O-S-T Scott and Julie 38, W-A-R-O,

[01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:29.520]
Bob and Tom only at 2-9.

[01:53:29.660 --> 01:53:30.600]
Bob and Tom are great.

[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:32.040]
And they sure as hell were back then,

[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:34.220]
that's before all the censorship started.

[01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:35.360]
Yeah, and I kicked their ass.

[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:38.320]
Well, I don't take this personally,

[01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:40.000]
but I sure as hell rather listen to Bob and Tom

[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:40.360]
than you.

[01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:41.680]
I mean, don't take that personal.

[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:42.400]
I would never.

[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:43.500]
Huh?

[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:44.540]
No, I wouldn't.

[01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:45.440]
You weren't in our demo anyway.

[01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:48.060]
Not now?

[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:48.960]
Or then?

[01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:49.880]
Not even back then.

[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:52.600]
And I don't think I was ever in that demo, you know what I mean?

[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:55.360]
Oh, there's Please Lack again.

[01:53:55.520 --> 01:54:01.720]
So I just like to shoot the chic and WTLQ Don I'mus

[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:03.060]
in last place with the two six.

[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:05.160]
One thing about I'mus, man, outside of New York,

[01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:07.680]
he's always bombed everywhere they try to put him on.

[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:10.240]
Big ass egg, your goose egg.

[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:11.400]
And now he's just bad.

[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:14.000]
Here's one from the fake lyric, King,

[01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:15.560]
I nominate Flea for Georgia's job.

[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:16.600]
He's a lot better around here.

[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:18.000]
See, then they go trying to start again.

[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:19.260]
Yeah, why don't you start?

[01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:19.500]
Start up.

[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:22.900]
Like Joe Rosas, stir it up.

[01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:24.060]
Why does Joe say that?

[01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:24.820]
Stir it up.

[01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:26.540]
I don't know, but did you play your electric bill?

[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:29.140]
What do you mean by that?

[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:30.100]
Your electric bill.

[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:31.320]
Oh, electric bill.

[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:33.020]
Don't get me started about the electric bill.

[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:34.160]
Are you picking on Joe Ros?

[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:35.100]
Now you making fun of him?

[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:35.500]
No, never.

[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:37.740]
Just because he's a big-headed jock.

[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:39.080]
Joe is good.

[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:39.740]
He's good people.

[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:40.320]
He's a good guy.

[01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:40.660]
He's sweet.

[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:41.200]
He's too much.

[01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:41.960]
He's a nice guy.

[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:45.080]
He's a great guy.

[01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:47.620]
And a good broadcaster.

[01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:49.500]
Not a great broadcaster, a good one though.

[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:53.000]
If he was great, he would tell clearance to bug off

[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:53.840]
with a stupid guest.

[01:54:54.260 --> 01:54:57.560]
And if he was like the macho man that all these guys are,

[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:00.300]
like mad dog, always campaigning about guest

[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:00.860]
are boring.

[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:01.240]
And he's right.

[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:02.540]
Guests are a tune out.

[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:05.620]
If you announce that my guest is going to be Ish Kibibble

[01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:08.080]
and like 30% of the audience hates Ish Kibibble,

[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:10.040]
they're going to turn out immediately if not sooner.

[01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:11.860]
Right?

[01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:12.380]
Yes.

[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:13.520]
It's a tune out.

[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.700]
It's taking narrow casting and narrowing it down.

[01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:19.620]
It's like taking a slice of pie and cutting it into

[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:23.380]
like 10 smaller slices and then picking out one teeny sliver.

[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:25.820]
Like Mo would say, a sliver of the pizza pie.

[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:28.140]
What did you think of Mo?

[01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:31.540]
I thought he was OK on the dolphin broadcast.

[01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:32.600]
Yeah.

[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:34.360]
Better than Jimmy Cifiless, sir.

[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:35.740]
Well, come on.

[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:37.460]
Goes without saying, huh?

[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:38.620]
Yeah.

[01:55:39.940 --> 01:55:42.220]
And did you ever meet him?

[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:43.560]
Did you have any interaction with him?

[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:44.340]
Never met him.

[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:46.580]
I didn't really listen to the show.

[01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:48.240]
I couldn't handle him.

[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:50.240]
What do you mean by that?

[01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:52.420]
I love the bit that you play about him saying to the national.

[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:53.380]
All the crap you could unwrap.

[01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:55.260]
All the slime all the time.

[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:56.740]
Jason, you're on QM.

[01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:57.660]
This one?

[01:55:57.700 --> 01:55:59.120]
We don't have any national guards there

[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:01.760]
because they're all fighting a war in Iraq right now.

[01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:02.700]
Not the national guard.

[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:04.060]
Pardon?

[01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:05.200]
Not the national guard.

[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:06.420]
No national guard in Iraq?

[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:08.240]
Not there's no national guard.

[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:08.600]
No.

[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:08.980]
Right.

[01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:10.240]
To which I would say.

[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:12.280]
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:13.020]
They were the first to go.

[01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:16.420]
Now was that the bit you were referring to that you loved?

[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:16.800]
Yes.

[01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:19.180]
So you never met the molemeister, huh?

[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:19.500]
No.

[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:21.600]
To meet him was to hate him.

[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:23.880]
When I started here, it was still the Kenny and Bo Morning Show.

[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.300]
Oh, the Kenny and Bo Morning Show.

[01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:26.280]
Now what was your take on that?

[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:27.660]
Did you go to Joe Bell right away and say,

[01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:29.500]
oh, let's get this piece of crap off the edge.

[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:31.100]
Oh, this is the worst garbage I ever heard in my life.

[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:32.680]
I actually said that before they put it on the air.

[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.520]
Oh, I said not in great detail.

[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:34.960]
And I told you.

[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:35.960]
I told you.

[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:36.760]
Stick to promotions.

[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:37.900]
This is programming.

[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:38.540]
Did you tell you that?

[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:39.660]
Like, clearance told you that time?

[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:39.920]
No.

[01:56:41.180 --> 01:56:42.020]
You did not tell you that.

[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:42.020]

[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:42.600]
What did you say?

[01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:45.540]
They said that they were going to give a shot and see what happens.

[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:46.220]
Yeah.

[01:56:46.340 --> 01:56:47.200]
They were going to give it a shot.

[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:48.840]
Not enough bullets in the gun, though.

[01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:52.780]
I guess Kenny and Bo Morning Show, hey, it's Robert Creeper, the Grand

[01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:53.700]
Reaper to Lord of the Board.

[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:57.920]
When I heard Kenny Walker say that's the first time I wanted to jump off my balcony.

[01:56:58.900 --> 01:57:00.140]
Kenny was out of his element.

[01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:00.780]
That's a problem.

[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:02.420]
Say it again.

[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:03.920]
Kenny was just out of his element.

[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:06.420]
I mean, I think he's a good FM jock for a female stage.

[01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:06.920]
That's right.

[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:07.380]
Yeah.

[01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:10.420]
Like Johnny Dork, he's a great three by five card reader.

[01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:11.140]
It's 87.

[01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:12.260]
He's got a great voice.

[01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:15.900]
But as far as personality, you know, Johnny doesn't have any, either does Kenny Walker.

[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:17.640]
Nice guy, though.

[01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:19.400]
Well, okay.

[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:20.120]
So it's D.A.

[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:21.600]
Everybody tells me it's a real nice guy.

[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:23.160]
I never met him, but I take their word for it.

[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:23.620]
Great guy.

[01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:25.480]
But he's got a point.

[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:26.580]
Oh, you got no number.

[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:26.900]
None.

[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:28.340]
None.

[01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:29.680]
I know the signal is terrible.

[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:30.000]
Okay.

[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:30.840]
Nobody can hear it.

[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:37.020]
But just by osmosis, just by saying hello, just by making the, just by making the tubes

[01:57:37.020 --> 01:57:37.920]
glow in the transmitter.

[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:38.840]
Let me ask you a question.

[01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:39.480]
Yeah.

[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:41.140]
Was the signal the same when any K was on?

[01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:43.920]
No, it was bad, but not this bad.

[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:44.660]
It's gotten order.

[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:44.840]
So.

[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:49.620]
Well, that's what your buddy Joe tells me is that nobody can hear the station at night.

[01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:50.060]
It's bad.

[01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:51.160]
Is it?

[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:51.660]
Yeah.

[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:55.980]
Well, what about during the daytime, like right now, like, Kukarajah, like we got all

[01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:58.120]
at the Kubano crap in the background from Fidel.

[01:57:58.380 --> 01:57:58.780]
Yeah, a little bit.

[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:02.760]
You think that would go suffer a number and a little of an a little bit, but it doesn't

[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:02.920]
work.

[01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:04.940]
Okay.

[01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:06.560]
When flea wasn't tampon to the M.A.

[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:10.400]
Anything to do with the tookie bird and what the hell did he do that got your roast

[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:12.800]
screaming and threatening to be disastrous, Mark and Kendall?

[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:15.560]
I don't know what the tookie bird is.

[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:20.220]
Oh, here you go.

[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:21.320]
A concern listener.

[01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:23.860]
Oh, you see, this is why your ratings suck.

[01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:24.980]
It's the same old crap.

[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:27.020]
You have to come up with some new material.

[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:28.280]
You're too stale.

[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:30.080]
You used to be pretty funny, but this is pathetic.

[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:33.540]
That's why Le Bastard and Castronova will always have higher ratings.

[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:35.480]
Treat people with respect.

[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:38.140]
Let them talk on the phone, quit hanging up on them.

[01:58:38.340 --> 01:58:38.360]
Right.

[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:39.180]
I'm your friend.

[01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:39.640]
That's right.

[01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:40.680]
Let them talk on the phone.

[01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:43.420]
If you can't change, get out of the business.

[01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:47.160]
If you don't care about your job or career, how about the people you're working with?

[01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:48.200]
You make millions.

[01:58:48.620 --> 01:58:49.760]
They make hourly wage.

[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:51.000]
I'd rather listen to Randy Rhodes.

[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:55.680]
What's the probability that she can work at five, sixty, especially taking your dull old

[01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:56.060]
spot?

[01:58:58.040 --> 01:58:59.240]
Signed a concern listener.

[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:03.440]
A concern listener undoubtedly from across the street.

[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:07.440]
Carnie says I was late off today.

[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:12.900]
I blame you because I got caught making emailing you during business hours.

[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:13.520]
Got any work?

[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:14.040]
Love the show.

[01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:14.740]
Thanks, Carnie.

[01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:16.740]
Got caught emailing the show during working hours.

[01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:18.080]
Anybody buying that?

[01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:18.460]
Not.

[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:20.180]
Picket's name.

[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:21.400]
Picket and stick it.

[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:25.480]
The most anticipated for me, is either lost, or even so bad.

[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:27.160]
Mr. Bush.

[01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:31.260]
You just can't stand here on the street corner in Washington, D.C.

[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:33.140]
Your presidency is over.

[01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:33.700]
I know that.

[01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:36.120]
You know, I still have images of those days.

[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:38.040]
I've vivided my mind.

[01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:40.780]
Yeah, it should seem like just yesterday.

[01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:42.680]
So what are you going to do now?

[01:59:43.180 --> 01:59:43.900]
I can't ask you that.

[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:44.440]
Really?

[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:45.680]
What are you going to do now?

[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:46.480]
I don't know.

[01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:47.540]
Really don't know.

[01:59:47.940 --> 01:59:49.140]
I'm not trying to hide anything.

[01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:51.400]
Laura, do you have any idea?

[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:52.420]
Not really.

[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:53.800]
No, I didn't say it coming.

[01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:57.560]
George, you mean to tell me you had no exit strategy?

[01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:01.120]
Well, I've lost the two hour premium event.

[02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:03.720]
OK, 12.45 a few whims.

[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:06.180]
So tell me what kind of a show you did in Four Bires.

[02:00:06.780 --> 02:00:08.660]
Was it like a typical morning zoo kind of a show?

[02:00:10.060 --> 02:00:10.460]
No.

[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:13.120]
I mean, we played some music, probably like four to six songs

[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:15.560]
an hour, and hopefully entertaining stuff in between.

[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:16.660]
Recorded it?

[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:19.260]
What used to do stuff like Boca-Brindus for you.

[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:20.120]
We used to do our own.

[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:22.320]
When I was in Tampa, we used to actually sell bits

[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:23.420]
to you man cow.

[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:24.520]
Really?

[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:25.140]
Yeah, I guess.

[02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:27.000]
Well, he sure did a big number in this market.

[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:27.700]
Oh, point.

[02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:28.440]
Oh, wow.

[02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:30.600]
Yeah, he's a horrible person, too.

[02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:31.580]
Is he really?

[02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:31.840]
Yeah.

[02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:34.460]
You met him?

[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:37.360]
Yeah, because he tried to hide away my partner in Tampa

[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:37.740]
at the time.

[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:38.600]
Yeah.

[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:40.220]
And we went up and talked him a little bit,

[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:40.940]
and yeah, he was an ass.

[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:42.360]
He was a what?

[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:43.140]
He was an ass.

[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:45.180]
Oh, I thought we were going to say the whole word.

[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:45.680]
Oh, no.

[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:46.000]
Oh.

[02:00:48.300 --> 02:00:50.400]
Now, could we say, no, I better not say it?

[02:00:51.380 --> 02:00:52.880]
Ask Joyce if we can say, whole.

[02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:55.260]
You know what I mean?

[02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:56.540]
Whole.

[02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:57.960]
Like, don whole.

[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:00.160]
If we can say, don whole, we can say, ass.

[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:03.580]
Anyway, here's one that says, any chance you can extend

[02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:04.960]
to your show one more, our show's 3PM.

[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:06.780]
There's nothing to listen to, two to three

[02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:08.720]
until Levitard comes on.

[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:10.560]
Levitard.

[02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:13.540]
Oh, now, what are we going to do between two and four?

[02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:14.880]
We have to take a poll on that.

[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:17.900]
Now, some people say, give George's own show.

[02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:20.380]
But of course, George can't work six hours a day.

[02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:22.220]
And we're not turning George loose.

[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:25.380]
Unless, of course, they offered him some big bucks,

[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:26.300]
which they won't do.

[02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:27.100]
You know what I mean?

[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:29.060]
Not your guy.

[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:31.060]
How about you doing two to four?

[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:31.700]
Sure.

[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:33.680]
I mean, getting all these emails saying,

[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:36.340]
oh, please sounds great on the ear and like that.

[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:39.760]
I'd do it.

[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:40.840]
You would, sure.

[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:43.840]
You could do a talk show?

[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:44.900]
Yeah, why not?

[02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:48.020]
Now, would you do a sports show or like a just a general show?

[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:49.200]
I would talk about all the,

[02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:51.000]
I prefer to do like a general show,

[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.560]
but I would mix in some sports with it.

[02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:56.320]
Yeah, like a little bit, like a, like dropping

[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:58.540]
like a little turd, like a pigeon turd.

[02:01:58.540 --> 02:02:00.600]
Yeah, the important stuff in each half hour.

[02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:03.040]
Oh, Super Bowl Sunday and then go back to strip clubs.

[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:03.760]
Yes.

[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:07.700]
Laird Lanny and Kendall must think that I'm 166,

[02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:10.460]
not just 66, stir it up as a Bob Marley song.

[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:11.560]
No Schmidt, Lanny.

[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:13.420]
That's not the point, though.

[02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:15.060]
That's just a line that the Jolex used.

[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:17.160]
Oh, yeah, in fact, on that mo thing,

[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:19.860]
you accuse me of trying to stir it up.

[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:20.500]
Isn't that what he says?

[02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:23.240]
I'll find it.

[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:24.000]
It's here somewhere.

[02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:26.620]
I want to give you an update of what took place

[02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:29.120]
just now off the air, because I think it's important here.

[02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:31.920]
Howard just called the radio station, Howard David,

[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:33.760]
who I get along with great.

[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:34.820]
But don't don't worry.

[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:38.980]
He called me a whole saying I was trying to stir it up.

[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:39.600]
See, there you go.

[02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:41.340]
My point back to Howard is, don't listen.

[02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:42.760]
I was trying to one on one.

[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:45.020]
See that that's a line that the Joe uses all the time.

[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:47.360]
And back when I first came to the station,

[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:49.060]
I was listening to the worst team on a way

[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:52.320]
to work in the morning with Joe and Gildey and the NIFO.

[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:55.280]
And I started getting the realization

[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.520]
that there were these catch phrases,

[02:02:57.640 --> 02:02:59.540]
these lines that they use over and over.

[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:02.540]
Like NIFO with his mailing it in and living large.

[02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:03.980]
And oh my God.

[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:05.220]
You know what I mean?

[02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:05.880]
Mm-hmm.

[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:08.420]
So you heard Joseph stir it up,

[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:12.300]
which has nothing to do with the Bob Marley song.

[02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:12.680]
No.

[02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:16.080]
I just, I don't know.

[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:18.560]
It just leaves me limp.

[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:21.580]
843 votes on a pool.

[02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:22.620]
You know something we can go over.

[02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:24.100]
We can do like 950 or something.

[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.620]
That would be pretty damn good considering.

[02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:29.020]
Here is one from a long time list.

[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:30.340]
You're manny from Kendall.

[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:31.040]
Oh yeah.

[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:33.860]
Manny from Kendall, my ass.

[02:03:34.060 --> 02:03:36.300]
I don't know why you've chosen to alienate your sports audience.

[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:37.680]
At least they have something to say

[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:39.980]
compared to the idiots who just call make stupid noises.

[02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:41.760]
You hang up on them and that's it.

[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:44.960]
It's like nobody can have a conversation with you anymore.

[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:47.140]
Bring back Dave Capredin, get rid of George

[02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:49.900]
and start talking to your audience again.

[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:51.280]
You washed up old Jew.

[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:53.060]
Sincerely manny from Kendall.

[02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:54.440]
It probably is manny from Kendall.

[02:03:55.020 --> 02:03:56.060]
A real retard.

[02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:01.040]
Oh and Jimmy Dorsky is back.

[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:02.940]
Neil any chance of a half price deal

[02:04:02.940 --> 02:04:05.000]
for restaurant further north for us in Palm Beach County?

[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:06.620]
I'm not complaining just curious.

[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:07.260]
Thank you.

[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:07.980]
Well you're welcome.

[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:09.160]
I don't know.

[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:11.540]
Ask the salespeople ask please.

[02:04:11.660 --> 02:04:13.480]
He'll tell you he's involved in that kind of stuff.

[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:16.340]
Any chance like an abok restaurant or like that?

[02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:17.700]
Maybe I'll get deaf on it.

[02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:19.260]
Yeah, get get get on muff.

[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:22.140]
Get all over her on it.

[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:25.360]
Boy, he could tell you some stories.

[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:26.440]
Maybe he already has.

[02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:28.380]
No, but I like to hear him.

[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:29.540]
Oh my God.

[02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:31.820]
My clearance was the assistant PD and how he stabbed

[02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:33.240]
muff in the back and took his job.

[02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:36.720]
And then all of a sudden muff was the operations manager

[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:38.160]
and they eliminated that position and muff.

[02:04:38.420 --> 02:04:40.300]
I've had to agree to go to sales, which you know what?

[02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:42.240]
You know what a hard-ass job that is going out

[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:43.380]
and pounding the pavement.

[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:43.940]
Oh yeah.

[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:45.740]
But he's done a good job.

[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:46.920]
He's done a good job for us.

[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:47.420]
Yep.

[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:49.140]
He's a good guy.

[02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:49.820]
I'll tell you that.

[02:04:50.020 --> 02:04:50.520]
That's all right.

[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:52.080]
Never has a negative thing to say about anybody.

[02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:52.960]
That is correct.

[02:04:53.660 --> 02:04:54.380]
Good person.

[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:57.640]
And has been screwed over badly in that joint.

[02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:58.880]
Oh my God.

[02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:01.500]
He could tell you stories that would make you grow here

[02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:03.000]
in places where it's illegal.

[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:07.600]
Neil, the owner of the Mons' Wieness is Joe Redner.

[02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:10.280]
One of the few voices of reason in Tampa politics.

[02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:12.520]
He's one of the few champions of free speech.

[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:14.540]
And someone who's always stood up to the knee-and-earth

[02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:15.860]
all around here says Pete and Tampa.

[02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:17.360]
Joe Redner, you know who that is?

[02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:17.920]
Absolutely.

[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:19.840]
Well, you being the Tampa...

[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:20.680]
And these people are saying,

[02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:22.740]
oh, it's the same old material we've never talked

[02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:25.540]
about flea being on the air or about Tampa radio

[02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:27.300]
or stuff like that, ever, ever, ever.

[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:29.380]
They used to have a TV show on public access.

[02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:30.740]
That was the Mons' access?

[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:31.280]
Yeah.

[02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:31.820]
Mons' initiative.

[02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:33.540]
And the girls will get naked every Wednesday night,

[02:05:33.620 --> 02:05:35.120]
11 o'clock, and be naked on your television.

[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:36.820]
No, it sounds like Al Goldstein's

[02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:38.860]
all show in New York, wasn't midnight blue.

[02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:39.580]
Mm-hmm.

[02:05:40.060 --> 02:05:41.000]
On public access?

[02:05:42.340 --> 02:05:44.040]
Well, everybody wants to see public access.

[02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:45.180]
That's for damn sure.

[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:47.980]
And in Tampa, no less days to have this?

[02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:48.480]
Absolutely.

[02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:49.780]
Oh, my...

[02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:50.340]
What did you say?

[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:51.080]
Absolutely.

[02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:51.520]
Oh.

[02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:54.040]
Holy moly, man.

[02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:56.900]
Let's see.

[02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:57.920]
The fake lyric Kings says,

[02:05:58.020 --> 02:05:58.800]
I like what I'm hearing,

[02:05:59.060 --> 02:06:01.420]
flea doing a sports light show from 2 to 4 would be great.

[02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:01.980]
Good.

[02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:03.040]
Good, Larry.

[02:06:03.580 --> 02:06:04.000]
Go to hell.

[02:06:05.980 --> 02:06:09.280]
If he had a hand in making youth of predation,

[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:11.360]
sung about pedophile priests,

[02:06:11.980 --> 02:06:13.040]
parody of youth of the nation,

[02:06:14.020 --> 02:06:16.100]
then Bubba used to play a 98 croc.

[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:19.160]
Scott wants to know if you had a hand in that.

[02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:19.500]
No.

[02:06:20.020 --> 02:06:20.300]
No.

[02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:22.880]
Why would you have a hand in what Bubba used to play?

[02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:25.240]
Did you ever sell him bits?

[02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:25.840]
I doubt that.

[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:26.760]
No, not at all.

[02:06:30.140 --> 02:06:31.960]
Here's one that's also I'm a vent,

[02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:32.620]
another idiot.

[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:34.320]
All choked up, eh?

[02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:36.460]
The three best personalities in South Florida radio are

[02:06:36.460 --> 02:06:37.640]
LeBaster, Castanova,

[02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:41.660]
and you shout out to Kimba,

[02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:43.300]
Neil, whatever happened to Steve Stancell?

[02:06:43.660 --> 02:06:45.900]
Is he doing Wasserman, Nissan voiceover still?

[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:47.080]
I don't know, and I don't care.

[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:48.300]
He wasn't ex-

[02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:50.560]
He wasn't ex-

[02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:51.220]
Steve Stancell?

[02:06:51.260 --> 02:06:51.400]
Yep.

[02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:53.140]
I just barely remember who that was.

[02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:56.580]
Get an F and Top at going Neil.

[02:06:56.960 --> 02:06:59.060]
Let's try a bit different approach today than you usual BS.

[02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:02.460]
Put the listeners' opinions to work on the movement, Neil God.

[02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:03.180]
No, no thanks.

[02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:05.800]
I'm going to block him.

[02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:08.020]
He's just getting too, too testy for me.

[02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:09.760]
I don't mind, I don't mind the hate emails, you know?

[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:11.180]
But just too testy.

[02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:13.620]
Too psychotic.

[02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:16.300]
Buh! Do this! Buh! Do that! Buh! Buh! Buh! Buh!

[02:07:16.940 --> 02:07:18.480]
All the more reason that it's good to be.

[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:18.620]
Yeah.

[02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:19.140]
No wife.

[02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:20.960]
No nagging wife.

[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:22.320]
If no nagging mother-in-law.

[02:07:25.140 --> 02:07:27.060]
Sixty plus years I had a nagging mother.

[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:29.400]
But luckily I lived most of the time far away.

[02:07:30.380 --> 02:07:32.700]
And even when I lived close by I would go like once a week.

[02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:33.280]
Obligatory.

[02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:34.720]
Tuesday launch at Mommies.

[02:07:35.340 --> 02:07:36.100]
Are you aware of that?

[02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:37.000]
At the Ark?

[02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:38.200]
No one.

[02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:39.500]
I mean usually at her house.

[02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:41.820]
And carriage hills right across the street from the Ark.

[02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:43.240]
Did you hear that about the Ark the other day?

[02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:43.580]
Yeah.

[02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:45.500]
The guy calling and trying to pedal me the Ark.

[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:47.700]
You should live so long that I'm going to go to the Ark.

[02:07:48.780 --> 02:07:49.940]
Oh my God.

[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:51.860]
The number of times that she slept us there.

[02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:52.280]
Oh!

[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.520]
A place from a hill.

[02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:58.080]
Whoever heard of a place where you go and you sit down.

[02:07:58.400 --> 02:07:59.440]
A light like a cattle.

[02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:03.080]
And they come running out with a cup or a bowl of soup

[02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:05.320]
before your ash hits the chair.

[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:06.220]
They bring you soup.

[02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:07.360]
You don't know what kind it is.

[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:08.380]
You don't know what you really want.

[02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:09.580]
I'm a soup lover too.

[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:10.340]
That's the interesting part.

[02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:10.840]
I love soup.

[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:13.260]
And the food, even on the Ark.

[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:15.160]
No one never ate cuisine like that.

[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:17.940]
Let's see.

[02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:20.520]
I'm going to gather all the Neocoffs and Chokes and Flim

[02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:23.020]
that you spew over the microphone for us listeners to hear.

[02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:23.760]
Good.

[02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:27.140]
And use Elvis's all shook up.

[02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:28.060]
All choked up.

[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:29.760]
Any chance of you doing it?

[02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:30.460]
Math on this one?

[02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:31.080]
No.

[02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:33.680]
That's the so I may vent again.

[02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:38.680]
Who's not even in the same category with your my bitch?

[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:40.180]
I mean, that's entertainment.

[02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:41.620]
So I may vent again.

[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:46.980]
In addition to what you're probably counting the number of times I clear my throat.

[02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:50.980]
I mean, I could reach over a shot off the mic like that.

[02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:52.100]
I'm not like Joey Reynolds.

[02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:54.600]
I need somebody else to turn the mic on and off.

[02:08:54.980 --> 02:08:55.880]
Are you aware of that?

[02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:58.440]
That Joey had Bill Marshall to turn the microphone on and off?

[02:08:58.580 --> 02:08:58.960]
I was not.

[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:00.480]
Well, he did.

[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:02.700]
At least in his IOD days.

[02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:05.400]
I don't know about now that he's on overnight and eight million states.

[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:08.740]
When fortunately most people are sleeping.

[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:12.620]
With that fresh new comedy, are you all that familiar with Joey Reynolds?

[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:13.480]
No, not really.

[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:13.980]
Good.

[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:19.520]
Washup has been DJ from WKBW in Buffalo a hundred years ago.

[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:21.060]
Who thinks he's an entertainer?

[02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:25.260]
Devious guy too.

[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:30.460]
The story is legendary about he and Russ Oasis coming into going to dinner with them.

[02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:36.820]
One night and trying the purpose of the dinner allegedly was because Russ was starting some talk show network around.

[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:39.220]
And there was never any conversation about talk show network.

[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:44.180]
It was all about me trying to how they wanted me to backstab Rick and Suds and get Joey the afternoon gig.

[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:47.560]
Oh, the radio wars are hot right now.

[02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:49.340]
Boba Boba Radio wars are hot.

[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:51.180]
Just an idiot Joey.

[02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:52.900]
A real simpleton.

[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:56.740]
But the business is full of them as you well know.

[02:09:57.920 --> 02:09:59.680]
So what do you think Boba is going to do in this market?

[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:03.180]
Do you think he's going to give us some competition for young Ron and old Paul or what?

[02:10:03.420 --> 02:10:04.940]
Yeah, I say he'll have a little bit of an impact.

[02:10:05.580 --> 02:10:05.900]
Yeah.

[02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:09.120]
Top 10 at least 25 54.

[02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:11.040]
Yeah, I would say so.

[02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:16.100]
Wouldn't it be something if he like kick Paul and old Ron's ass wouldn't that be great even though you hate him like poison?

[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:19.380]
And he hates you.

[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:20.260]
Yeah.

[02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:22.700]
A lot of people in the business don't like you for some reason.

[02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:24.640]
You seem like such a benign guy, you know.

[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:25.140]
Yeah.

[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:29.940]
But behind the scenes, God only knows in fact even right now who knows what kind of crap you're pulling.

[02:10:31.140 --> 02:10:33.220]
What's the van to do, hour?

[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:34.720]
Hi, V.

[02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:36.680]
I miss his boring.

[02:10:37.060 --> 02:10:39.660]
What's better than a live radio show every morning on TV?

[02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:40.980]
Well, just about anything.

[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:46.420]
But that hasn't stopped MSNBC from teaming up with radio's original bad boy who now looks like a nasty old lady.

[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:49.460]
Listen Bernie, I'm a salad intern as coffee sipes.

[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:53.160]
Yes, every morning, see I miss listen to a tape of other people's county bits.

[02:10:53.380 --> 02:10:54.400]
Live on the air.

[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:56.020]
I need a hammer to bite into this muffin.

[02:10:56.180 --> 02:10:57.900]
Somebody to pass the fresh one plays like you.

[02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:00.000]
See his wild behind the scenes addicts.

[02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:00.900]
Listen to me, stupid.

[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:03.280]
I am the Iman, you are the walrus cucko cucko choon.

[02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:04.920]
Now get me some fresh coffee or your fire.

[02:11:05.220 --> 02:11:05.560]
I miss.

[02:11:05.820 --> 02:11:06.520]
He's irreverent.

[02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:07.780]
So what's the deal with Paul?

[02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:08.800]
He's topical.

[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:10.480]
So what's the deal with his watergate break?

[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:11.880]
He's incoherent.

[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:13.860]
I'll tell you what, that's a double representation.

[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:14.660]
What else?

[02:11:14.940 --> 02:11:15.220]
I don't know.

[02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:17.680]
He's I'm his friend, he's boring.

[02:11:18.100 --> 02:11:19.760]
And he's only on MSNBC.

[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:21.320]
A table channel nobody watches.

[02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:23.680]
And a bunch of AM radio stations nobody listens to.

[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:25.200]
And somebody gets some fresh jingle.

[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:27.880]
It's Irish, a real, uh, pleasant guy.

[02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:29.820]
101 and 560 WQ AM.

[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:30.680]
Uh-huh.

[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:32.160]
He made a big impact in this market.

[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:32.680]
Let me tell you.

[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:33.420]
Oh, oh.

[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:33.760]

[02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:36.700]
Now what station is he on?

[02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:37.720]
Is he on the E50 deal?

[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:38.120]
Is that it?

[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:39.700]
I can't keep track of his own wins.

[02:11:39.700 --> 02:11:39.780]
No, he's on wins.

[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:41.320]
He is?

[02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:41.700]
Yeah.

[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:43.680]
He's on, uh, with Scare America.

[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:44.080]
Yep.

[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:48.840]
And old, uh, gas bag like him is on Scare America.

[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:50.620]
But that cheap gentleman, they're all over the place.

[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:53.660]
Well, at least he's on the station with a signal anyway.

[02:11:54.620 --> 02:11:55.020]
Unfortunately.

[02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:02.400]
Now why doesn't Beasley just buy I.N.Z.?

[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:06.000]
Wouldn't that make sense since they're going to flip it to all sports?

[02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:11.680]
That would be like, uh, you know, precluding the possibility of them chopping off another chunk of our diminishing audience?

[02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:18.240]
I mean, even if they suck, which they did before with the Fox, were they already tried that a few years ago?

[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:19.280]
Are you aware of that?

[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:21.480]
Yeah, I was working there when they were Fox.

[02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:22.000]
You were?

[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:23.080]
Yeah, I was working at Zeta.

[02:12:25.060 --> 02:12:29.220]
Is that when Stu Gotts was over there at 940 and Clarence was booking guests for him?

[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:30.520]
I don't know about that.

[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:32.780]
Well, let me tell you right now that's a true story.

[02:12:34.140 --> 02:12:36.720]
Stu Gotts was working at 940 at the competition.

[02:12:36.900 --> 02:12:45.500]
He left here, went over there and Clarence, being his close personal buddy, even though they were the competition, he was allegedly booking guests for Stu Gotts on 940.

[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:46.180]
Wow.

[02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:50.340]
Yeah, sounds like actionable to me to get canned.

[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:52.760]
You ought to fire Clarence and take that job.

[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:54.160]
What?

[02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:57.400]
Now, he's got to be making more bucks than you are.

[02:12:57.480 --> 02:12:57.920]
Oh, absolutely.

[02:12:58.120 --> 02:12:59.180]
I think George makes more money than me.

[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:01.200]
George makes more money than you?

[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:01.520]
Yes.

[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:03.180]
Get out of here.

[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:05.180]
The cleaning guy makes more than George.

[02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:10.680]
So in other words, your good personal friend, Joe Bell, really stuck it to you. Is that the deal?

[02:13:11.380 --> 02:13:12.660]
I just know I make less than George.

[02:13:12.980 --> 02:13:15.240]
Then you see you don't want to say that, even though it's true.

[02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:19.600]
See, I'm all confused about the Miguel thing.

[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:21.240]
Miguel was the great guy.

[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:26.300]
He would fill in on this show and like today, when George would be out sick, he would fill in.

[02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:30.220]
Or when we needed a third person back in the day when we had three.

[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:34.560]
And he was the promotions guy and he was just like by everybody.

[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:35.720]
He was a good all around guy.

[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:37.140]
Nothing just like I've met him.

[02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:37.600]
I like him.

[02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:38.580]
Yeah, he's a good guy.

[02:13:38.700 --> 02:13:38.860]
Yeah.

[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:44.220]
And he got canned so that Joe could bring in his buddy from Raleigh, which wasn't you.

[02:13:44.420 --> 02:13:44.700]
No.

[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:45.680]
Who was it?

[02:13:45.860 --> 02:13:47.040]
Some guy named Daniel, I think.

[02:13:47.580 --> 02:13:50.740]
Yeah, I never, he wasn't around long enough for me to ever confront him.

[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:51.120]
Yeah.

[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:53.920]
And then what happened to him?

[02:13:54.380 --> 02:13:54.960]
I'm not really sure.

[02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:56.160]
I think he just left on his own.

[02:13:56.360 --> 02:13:58.160]
He left on his own because they weren't paying him squat.

[02:13:58.560 --> 02:13:59.260]
I think that's the case.

[02:13:59.260 --> 02:13:59.600]
Maybe.

[02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:01.060]
I really don't know.

[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:02.440]
I don't, I don't get it.

[02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:04.880]
Why did he take the job in the first place if they weren't paying him squat?

[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:05.480]
I don't get it.

[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:07.080]
I think he was a sales guy first.

[02:14:07.540 --> 02:14:09.120]
Oh, a sales guy.

[02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:10.240]
A sales hole.

[02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:10.960]
Yeah, I think so.

[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:14.060]
Well, one thing I want all you kids out there never to forget.

[02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:16.000]
Sales people are ice holes.

[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:16.240]
Yeah.

[02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:19.320]
A sales guy.

[02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:21.860]
And.

[02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:24.380]
And then, and then you replaced him as at the deal.

[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:25.400]
Yeah.

[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:27.680]
And where were you working at the time and for Myers?

[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:28.240]
No, where.

[02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:30.920]
No, where you were out on the street on the beach.

[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:32.200]
I get out of radio for a little while.

[02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:34.220]
Oh, and you got back into it?

[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:35.540]
Oh, and I thought you were a bright guy.

[02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:35.900]
I know.

[02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:38.300]
What were you doing in the interim?

[02:14:39.020 --> 02:14:41.060]
I was working for a mortgage broker.

[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:43.580]
Yeah.

[02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:44.100]
Yeah.

[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:45.520]
I caused the problem.

[02:14:45.620 --> 02:14:46.740]
I caused the whole bubble to burst.

[02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:48.580]
Now we understand what all happened.

[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.100]
Oh, we got a snowfall warning.

[02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:51.660]
20 to 30 centimeters now.

[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:56.240]
The 15 will likely be closer towards the Niagara region 40 years.

[02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:57.640]
I think Catherine's looking at that.

[02:14:58.080 --> 02:14:58.940]
Total for us here.

[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:03.640]
Probably just over 10 centimeters when it's finally starts to taper off.

[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:09.740]
Now towards the eastern Ontario, Kingston, east of Ottawa looking at 20 to possibly in some

[02:15:09.740 --> 02:15:11.840]
cases 30 centimeters of snow.

[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:13.780]
Now it's fairly light but steady.

[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:15.480]
There's a live look at the offer 20.

[02:15:15.580 --> 02:15:16.200]
Oh my God.

[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:19.060]
We got a big green blob over the whole GTA man.

[02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:20.580]
A big green blob.

[02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:22.140]
So today close to school today, Ellen?

[02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:24.020]
I would think so.

[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:24.420]
Yeah.

[02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:24.760]
I don't know.

[02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:25.700]
What are you asking me?

[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:26.580]
Do I have kids in school?

[02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:27.160]
I don't know.

[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:30.220]
You think Paco's in school?

[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:31.100]
He's sleeping, man.

[02:15:31.180 --> 02:15:32.260]
It's not even two o'clock yet.

[02:15:32.260 --> 02:15:32.740]
Nice.

[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:34.040]
I'm sure he's upstairs.

[02:15:34.420 --> 02:15:35.720]
Party all night, sleep all day.

[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:36.880]
That's the Mexican F and Y.

[02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:37.700]
How do I get that gig?

[02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:40.340]
He's retired.

[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:44.780]
That's his line.

[02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:45.400]
I'm retired.

[02:15:47.380 --> 02:15:49.480]
Hey listen, it's just the way it is, you know?

[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:52.020]
In addition to which where are you going to go on a day like this?

[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:53.860]
I just looked out the window during the one o'clock break.

[02:15:54.500 --> 02:16:00.160]
I went in my bedroom and I opened the drapes wide and I looked out and it's a mess.

[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:04.560]
We went from yesterday where most of the snow was pretty much gone and the roads were clean as a whistle.

[02:16:05.020 --> 02:16:10.980]
You could eat off the streets yesterday and now it's that not just snow but you know the ICS stuff that...

[02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:12.580]
Oh, you know what I'm talking about?

[02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:13.400]
Kind of.

[02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:16.160]
Now did you ever live up north or you'd like to always in Florida?

[02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:18.240]
No, the farthest north I ever lived was Atlanta.

[02:16:19.060 --> 02:16:20.240]
Oh, well they got snow.

[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:21.320]
Sometimes, yeah.

[02:16:22.580 --> 02:16:23.380]
You living in Atlanta?

[02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:24.240]
I thought you were white.

[02:16:25.420 --> 02:16:26.520]
Yeah, I only lived there for this summer.

[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:28.900]
They have a lot of dark folks in Atlanta.

[02:16:28.900 --> 02:16:30.520]
I mean, nothing there's anything wrong with that but...

[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:31.920]
Am I right?

[02:16:32.180 --> 02:16:33.900]
It's about 27% I think, yeah.

[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:34.800]
Black?

[02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:35.400]
Mm-hmm.

[02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:36.660]
Not like Detroit though.

[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:38.500]
Detroit is like 97% black.

[02:16:39.260 --> 02:16:42.200]
Not that there's anything wrong with that except that the white people keep moving away.

[02:16:42.900 --> 02:16:43.820]
Farther and farther.

[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:44.740]
Pretty soon they...

[02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:46.620]
White people from Detroit are going to be at the North Pole.

[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:50.560]
They're going to be long gone.

[02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:53.480]
In fact, look where they built the damn stadium.

[02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:54.040]
Pontiac.

[02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:55.340]
No wonder the Lions never win a game.

[02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:56.480]
Who wants to...

[02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:01.260]
Who wants to slap all the way to Pontiac to go to a football game to see the worst team in the history of the league?

[02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:04.440]
They're not like that Toronto make believes though.

[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:05.920]
Let me tell you, I am...

[02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:08.480]
I just can't believe that this community is wanting to put up with this.

[02:17:08.540 --> 02:17:10.100]
They've had mediocrity for so many years.

[02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:11.500]
42 years.

[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:14.400]
I know they're willing to put up with a lot but...

[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:19.400]
The advantage of blender finance is Gortzide, one lunch, the peri-air shoots it off the boards for research.

[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:23.960]
They'll go keep for him but hand it to Horton and his pass for...

[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:25.720]
Let's go to Tim Horton's for a nice cup of coffee.

[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:26.160]
What do you say?

[02:17:26.340 --> 02:17:26.940]
In a bagel.

[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:28.180]
Shooting it back in again.

[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:30.360]
A lower. Let it go.

[02:17:30.860 --> 02:17:32.600]
Johnny Bauer, he was my favorite man.

[02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:33.960]
He's still alive.

[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:35.100]
He's 185.

[02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:37.480]
And he's still alive.

[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.180]
There's not a backhand.

[02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:40.600]
We're shot.

[02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:42.480]
Even a right side in the net.

[02:17:42.900 --> 02:17:46.220]
Pretty tense affair with the score two to one and moving on in the third period.

[02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:48.100]
From the face up and touch the basket.

[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:50.120]
Took a shot at the end.

[02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:53.480]
A shot.

[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:56.380]
This is called living in the distant past.

[02:17:56.900 --> 02:17:57.820]
Just like Dolphins.

[02:17:58.020 --> 02:17:59.540]
Everyone here is something really bad.

[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:01.680]
Check out the Panther broadcast on on 790.

[02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:03.960]
Whoever does the play by play.

[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:04.900]
Randy Moore.

[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:06.020]
Oh my god.

[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:06.780]
Terrible.

[02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:07.980]
Another ex-jock.

[02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:08.680]
He's terrible.

[02:18:08.820 --> 02:18:09.440]
Hey, come back.

[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.060]
Tell him over the line.

[02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:13.340]
Hold the man he's since the length of a hybrid.

[02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:14.680]
Oh, hold the man.

[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:16.740]
Slow down to make the face.

[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:19.520]
First shot of right side of the shot.

[02:18:20.100 --> 02:18:21.460]
How he comes to him.

[02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:22.600]
Put it over the line.

[02:18:22.740 --> 02:18:23.960]
Like a reverse shot.

[02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:25.140]
And that's why.

[02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:27.400]
And Kelly's got it to the Hamlet.

[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:29.580]
The Hamlet just checked by below.

[02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:31.680]
Hamlet's back to the bar.

[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:32.740]
Let's get hockey intensive.

[02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:33.180]
What do you say?

[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:34.760]
Panthers or hot men playoffs?

[02:18:34.980 --> 02:18:35.820]
I'm in the Hamlet.

[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:36.560]
Go over the line.

[02:18:37.780 --> 02:18:39.260]
He's just in the behind the net.

[02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:40.340]
I'm trying to protect him.

[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:42.160]
Are you not can silly read your Randy Emor?

[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:42.980]
Oh, he's terrible.

[02:18:42.980 --> 02:18:44.080]
Hello, it's Dump by.

[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:46.380]
He's no Jimmy Cifalus.

[02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:46.900]
He's worse.

[02:18:47.260 --> 02:18:49.500]
You see, you see the consistent pattern though here?

[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:51.000]
X-jocks.

[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:51.920]
X-jocks.

[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:52.800]
X-jocks.

[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:53.780]
Back for it.

[02:18:54.900 --> 02:18:55.480]
I'm strong.

[02:18:56.520 --> 02:18:57.100]
To Kea.

[02:18:58.180 --> 02:18:59.220]
At the center.

[02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:00.200]
Over the line.

[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:01.060]
And to shot.

[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:02.040]
Come on.

[02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:02.720]
Come on.

[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:03.740]
Gump orzli.

[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:06.260]
There is a D-Fo's Eddie Jackamon and Gump orzli.

[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:07.900]
That's D-Fo's hockey vocabulary.

[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:09.360]
That's his repertoire.

[02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:11.720]
Ed Jackamon and Gump orzli.

[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:13.240]
Long pass for Ellas.

[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:15.200]
Ellas took his shot.

[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:16.320]
Harris breaks it out.

[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:18.380]
He did break it from the head to Richard.

[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:19.860]
Team Dipto.

[02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:20.600]
Over the line.

[02:19:21.140 --> 02:19:21.640]
Close again.

[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:23.420]
Cover it by the...

[02:19:24.220 --> 02:19:25.140]
Ellas is checked.

[02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:27.460]
Richard comes from behind the net.

[02:19:27.700 --> 02:19:29.340]
Then the waiting for his shoot.

[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:30.740]
He's so blind.

[02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:32.740]
Ellas gets the puck.

[02:19:34.180 --> 02:19:35.300]
There's it down the ice.

[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:39.000]
See, if you live in the past long enough,

[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.080]
you can find a year that you did good.

[02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:46.040]
Like the dolphins living in the early 70s.

[02:19:47.540 --> 02:19:49.360]
Can't live in the past forever, you know what I'm saying?

[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:51.900]
Sooner or later you've got to put a product out there

[02:19:51.900 --> 02:19:53.200]
that somebody can be proud of.

[02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:55.360]
Somebody can say, hey, this is worth paying to go see.

[02:19:56.660 --> 02:19:58.420]
As opposed to these make-believes.

[02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:00.700]
Losing six to one in Minnesota.

[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:03.580]
To a girls' team in Minnesota with that freaking...

[02:20:03.580 --> 02:20:04.600]
Jacques Lamar.

[02:20:05.700 --> 02:20:06.880]
Oh my God.

[02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:11.160]
Never less.

[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:13.560]
Serious, by the way, is back up to 12 cents.

[02:20:13.780 --> 02:20:13.980]
Wow.

[02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:16.440]
Let me double check.

[02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:17.800]
It was back up to 12 this morning.

[02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:18.820]
Let me take a look at it now.

[02:20:19.260 --> 02:20:21.000]
It could be a real selling opportunity.

[02:20:24.260 --> 02:20:25.580]
Serious XM radio ink.

[02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:27.700]
Have you have serious in your card?

[02:20:27.780 --> 02:20:28.900]
You have 12 cents.

[02:20:29.540 --> 02:20:30.860]
It's hanging right in there at 12 cents.

[02:20:31.020 --> 02:20:31.760]
Yes, I do have it.

[02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:33.200]
And...

[02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:33.840]
I enjoy it.

[02:20:34.260 --> 02:20:35.300]
What do you enjoy about it?

[02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:36.220]
Well, I like to hear it.

[02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:37.000]
No, I don't listen to...

[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:37.660]
You like how it's sperm?

[02:20:37.940 --> 02:20:40.640]
I listen to the music because there's no new music down here in South Florida.

[02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:41.740]
Amen.

[02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:46.020]
The worst FM in the history of mankind isn't South Florida.

[02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:46.440]
Yes.

[02:20:46.940 --> 02:20:47.400]
The worst.

[02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:48.700]
Bar none.

[02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:51.500]
And why do you think that is?

[02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:53.760]
A lot of bad programmers, I would think.

[02:20:53.940 --> 02:20:54.360]
Clear channel.

[02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:55.760]
Chief channel.

[02:20:55.980 --> 02:20:56.500]
They started it.

[02:20:57.620 --> 02:20:58.760]
Now, they didn't start it.

[02:20:58.860 --> 02:21:00.180]
It was bad before they came along.

[02:21:00.360 --> 02:21:00.820]
Then they just...

[02:21:00.820 --> 02:21:04.680]
Then they took a bunch of formerly good stations like she and they destroyed them.

[02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:09.480]
And like Cox broadcasting what they did with GTR and they turned into the coast.

[02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:10.560]
So we have slush.

[02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:13.100]
We have Michael Bolton and Gloria Stefan records on.

[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:13.680]
Which nobody...

[02:21:14.280 --> 02:21:15.960]
Even those people don't want to hear it.

[02:21:19.020 --> 02:21:22.360]
Wouldn't you just like to take all the bad programmers in a room,

[02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:23.760]
like in the conference room down there?

[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:24.200]
Yes.

[02:21:25.100 --> 02:21:25.840]
And put off...

[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:29.060]
Remember like in Godfather 3 in the scene in Lannich City in the casino?

[02:21:29.660 --> 02:21:29.940]
Mm-hmm.

[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:30.680]
With a helicopter?

[02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:33.480]
And turn it in.

[02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:34.680]
Remember that?

[02:21:35.080 --> 02:21:36.900]
Yeah, I don't remember much about the Revit, I remember that.

[02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:39.820]
Are you just going to start...

[02:21:39.820 --> 02:21:42.580]
You're just doing this to pacify George, knocking Godfather 3.

[02:21:42.780 --> 02:21:43.340]
It wasn't.

[02:21:43.460 --> 02:21:43.540]
It wasn't.

[02:21:43.540 --> 02:21:43.860]
It wasn't.

[02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:43.920]

[02:21:44.360 --> 02:21:44.520]
It wasn't.

[02:21:44.520 --> 02:21:49.240]
But there were some just tremendous truths in there.

[02:21:49.420 --> 02:21:52.900]
The thing about the Vatican banking scandal and the poisoning of the Pope.

[02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:54.040]
All of these things.

[02:21:54.160 --> 02:21:54.940]
All of these things.

[02:21:55.060 --> 02:21:58.100]
Nobody in the mainstream media suddenly wants to touch those with a hot poker.

[02:21:58.420 --> 02:21:58.620]
No.

[02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:03.000]
But the casting was a little weak.

[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.320]
The dialogue and the casting.

[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:05.600]
Maybe they should fear you.

[02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:10.100]
Remember that scene Connie says Michael, now they will fear you.

[02:22:10.200 --> 02:22:11.040]
Maybe they should fear you.

[02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:14.420]
I mean, bringing back, repreasing lots of lines from the first two.

[02:22:14.860 --> 02:22:16.840]
And usually none of them made any sense.

[02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:21.520]
But nevertheless.

[02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:23.000]
They can't all be...

[02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:24.620]
You know, it's like the shows.

[02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:25.820]
Like these radio shows.

[02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:28.160]
They can't all be like me, for you know.

[02:22:28.340 --> 02:22:28.480]
Right.

[02:22:29.900 --> 02:22:31.220]
He's got a point three, by the way.

[02:22:31.220 --> 02:22:32.180]
In the morning and in the book.

[02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:33.040]
Wow, he went up.

[02:22:34.300 --> 02:22:35.440]
Zero point three.

[02:22:35.700 --> 02:22:37.320]
Anybody who's got a number that starts with a...

[02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:37.480]
Oh!

[02:22:37.620 --> 02:22:38.400]
...shouldn't be on the ear.

[02:22:39.100 --> 02:22:41.180]
I could be wrong about that, but that's just my...

[02:22:41.180 --> 02:22:43.380]
After 100 years in the business, that's my personal take.

[02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:46.060]
Anybody who's got a number in any book that starts with a...

[02:22:46.060 --> 02:22:46.240]
Oh!

[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:47.140]
...take him off now.

[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:49.200]
Take him, drag him out of there, kicking and screaming.

[02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:51.540]
Oh, I snore!

[02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:55.400]
While spending the remainder of your golden years in the land of death.

[02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:58.700]
The one thing you have to defend on is your car.

[02:22:58.700 --> 02:23:00.940]
With Chiu Kanu's F-Don's arise.

[02:23:01.340 --> 02:23:04.600]
The people who brought you a big black guy named Ben Karolarm.

[02:23:04.780 --> 02:23:08.300]
Now bring you an old Jewish guy named Eisen.

[02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:10.700]
Get away from my portable bell.

[02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:13.140]
You big M.F.

[02:23:13.740 --> 02:23:16.380]
Remember when we used to post a back in Caribbean?

[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:18.980]
Yeah, we ought to get a bundle of the fish, baby.

[02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:20.260]
Dwight was a cooler.

[02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:23.060]
Get away from my portable bell.

[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:25.480]
You big M.F.

[02:23:25.620 --> 02:23:26.500]
What the hell is that?

[02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:28.340]
I object seriously.

[02:23:28.860 --> 02:23:29.260]
Hmm.

[02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:31.560]
For a badity like that.

[02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:33.460]
I take somebody's car.

[02:23:33.580 --> 02:23:35.840]
Get away from my portable bell.

[02:23:36.220 --> 02:23:38.220]
You big M.F.

[02:23:38.820 --> 02:23:41.700]
Get away from my portable bell.

[02:23:42.320 --> 02:23:44.020]
You big M.F.

[02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:50.780]
Whenever some bastard tries to steer my car, I feel safer with an old Jewish guy named Eisen.

[02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:53.400]
Get away from my portable bell.

[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:55.780]
You big M.F.

[02:23:55.780 --> 02:23:59.220]
Get your old Jewish guy named Eisen Karolarm now.

[02:23:59.460 --> 02:24:01.620]
And receive a free flower antenna.

[02:24:01.820 --> 02:24:05.620]
Get away, get away, get away from my portable bell.

[02:24:06.300 --> 02:24:08.580]
You big M.F.

[02:24:08.780 --> 02:24:11.120]
An old Jewish guy named Eisen Karolarm.

[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:13.360]
Now available at all, there's stories.

[02:24:13.640 --> 02:24:15.760]
Okay, 185, 60WQM.

[02:24:15.860 --> 02:24:16.800]
Happy Wednesday to it.

[02:24:16.900 --> 02:24:19.240]
Man, the snow has come down up here like you wouldn't believe.

[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:21.500]
Just kiss the ground that you're there for this one day.

[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:23.740]
Rest of the days, spit on it.

[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:25.140]
And the ground too.

[02:24:26.980 --> 02:24:28.340]
Oh, Jimmy Dwarisky is back again.

[02:24:28.420 --> 02:24:29.280]
This is one of those guys.

[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:31.800]
And it's a butt-sucking email, so I'll read it.

[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:33.640]
Okay?

[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:34.260]
Okay.

[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:42.260]
Neil, I said I did that just for the other emailer who's counting the number of times I clear my throat and I do all that stuff and sneeze and stuff.

[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:45.160]
Obviously a big groupie.

[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:46.000]
Just don't fart.

[02:24:46.860 --> 02:24:47.780]
Oh, I did.

[02:24:49.620 --> 02:24:50.280]
Just a...

[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:52.000]
You can fart just so Joyce can't smell it.

[02:24:52.580 --> 02:24:55.280]
And don't forget Joyce has a problem with penis and vagina.

[02:24:56.600 --> 02:24:56.880]
Hmm.

[02:24:57.980 --> 02:24:58.180]
What?

[02:24:58.660 --> 02:25:01.300]
The word sort of the actual body parts.

[02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:06.800]
Those were the exact words from your program director, Clarence Dero.

[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:11.400]
Joyce has a real problem with penis and vagina.

[02:25:12.060 --> 02:25:16.880]
Those were the words from a allegedly living and breathing person who was an alleged program director.

[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:27.300]
Neil, God, please ask for me if being from Tampa himself, he's ever met or worked with Taj Mit and is he as big of a chicken-ock bastard as he seems on the year.

[02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:27.760]
Yes.

[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:30.100]
Well, what does that mean?

[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:31.780]
I mean, I know what chicken-hawk means, but why?

[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:34.100]
I don't think he's a chicken-hawk, but he's an ass.

[02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:35.160]
Is he really?

[02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:35.500]
Yeah.

[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:38.400]
Now, who's he feuding with all the time? Is it Bubba?

[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:39.320]
Yeah, they hate each other.

[02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:42.160]
And why is that? Can you tell us the background on that?

[02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:45.040]
I don't know a whole lot, but they used to work together over there at J.Core.

[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:47.360]
And I think that they just slowly started to hate each other.

[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:48.080]
Really?

[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:48.480]
Yeah.

[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:51.180]
The Schmidt-Mister, who of course is Rush Jr.

[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:52.460]
A real Rush wannabe.

[02:25:52.620 --> 02:25:52.940]
Oh, yeah.

[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:55.380]
All he needs to do is laugh, don't, don't, don't, don't do that.

[02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:58.180]
And he'll, you know, he'll have it down to a science.

[02:25:58.440 --> 02:25:59.240]
Yeah, they always got to do the start.

[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:00.220]
Pop and Pills.

[02:26:00.460 --> 02:26:02.600]
They were both on 93-3 FLC together.

[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:05.280]
MJ and BJ were doing the mornings, and Bubba was on at night.

[02:26:05.780 --> 02:26:06.060]
Mm-hmm.

[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:10.500]
I think we ought to start promoting the Bubba show because it's not a competition to us.

[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:13.500]
People who are going to listen to us are not going to listen to Bubba's love sponge,

[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:15.680]
but it's certainly a competition for Paul and Old Ron.

[02:26:16.420 --> 02:26:16.640]
Oh, yeah.

[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:20.040]
And anything we can do to damage them that they haven't already done of themselves,

[02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:22.460]
especially with all the material they've stolen from me over the years.

[02:26:24.420 --> 02:26:27.460]
I mean, when Paul, when Castor Nova started doing the Toronto weather,

[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:29.260]
I thought that was just a little bit too much, you know?

[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:30.080]
Mm-hmm.

[02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:31.240]
Yeah, he used to get emails.

[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:34.420]
Hey, Neil, you forgot to give me the weather so I can talk about it tomorrow morning in Toronto.

[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:37.540]
What a ass.

[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:40.200]
Minus six right now.

[02:26:40.300 --> 02:26:42.300]
It's going all the way up to minus three this afternoon.

[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:44.220]
Snow in like a son of a bitch.

[02:26:45.460 --> 02:26:47.200]
20 to 30 centimeters of snow.

[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:48.660]
10 to 12 inches of snow today.

[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:50.240]
And it's just steady.

[02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:51.960]
I'm looking there showing the highways on there now.

[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:53.320]
I want to tell you about it.

[02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:54.220]
At least through this area.

[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:55.420]
We'll take a look through bathrooms.

[02:26:56.520 --> 02:26:58.400]
And we'll take a look through Young Street.

[02:26:58.620 --> 02:26:59.320]
Nothing could be done.

[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:01.160]
A finer than the stayoff of Spadina.

[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:03.460]
Well, wait till the afternoon rush starts in.

[02:27:03.540 --> 02:27:05.920]
Then we're going to have a real jam up this afternoon.

[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:08.160]
We'll have a look through with Victoria Park.

[02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:10.040]
You're saying you think you got, Sir? It's just wait.

[02:27:10.140 --> 02:27:12.100]
Everybody seems to be making through okay.

[02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:14.140]
And through Markham Road is...

[02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:16.720]
Do you know that they opened a deli back at the time when we were on S.U.E.

[02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:18.500]
and doing that week of shows over there in Tampa?

[02:27:19.740 --> 02:27:22.820]
And we had the deli brought us in food.

[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:24.060]
Right?

[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:27.240]
And the deli stayed in business for, I don't know, a few months, I guess.

[02:27:27.700 --> 02:27:30.860]
And I kept saying, how can a deli make an in-tempo where there's only goy-im?

[02:27:30.860 --> 02:27:32.660]
I think you were probably the only G over there.

[02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:33.260]
There's not many.

[02:27:34.740 --> 02:27:36.020]
I mean, that is...

[02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:39.520]
There's such a thing as goy-ish in heaven, or maybe goy-ish in hell would be a better in the stripping.

[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:46.440]
It's Tampa, which is why I find it bizarre that in a place that's so full of narrow-minded crackers red necks,

[02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:49.760]
that they got all them strip joints over there, that we were talking about before.

[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:54.560]
Well, they had passed the law for a while that the dancers couldn't come within six feet of the clientele.

[02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:55.820]
Right, that was in the story that I read.

[02:27:55.980 --> 02:27:55.980]

[02:27:55.980 --> 02:27:57.060]
But you weren't paying any attention, right?

[02:27:57.200 --> 02:27:57.420]
A little bit.

[02:27:57.640 --> 02:27:58.120]
I don't blame you.

[02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:00.300]
And Redner was paying the fines. He didn't care.

[02:28:01.340 --> 02:28:02.300]
And Mons' Wieners.

[02:28:02.420 --> 02:28:02.560]
Yeah.

[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:05.040]
Yeah.

[02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:07.300]
And that was it. I mean, they tried to shut it down, but they couldn't.

[02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:08.760]
Supply into man.

[02:28:10.340 --> 02:28:15.780]
So all you people going over to Tampa for the Super Bowl this weekend, if you can't get a ticket for the game or get in on the inside,

[02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:18.720]
just go to the strip clubs and have you a great time or just have you.

[02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:22.140]
How many strip clubs are there?

[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:25.240]
In fact, it seems to me there's a place called the Del House.

[02:28:25.540 --> 02:28:25.900]
Yes.

[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:32.960]
During the week that we were staying and we did the shows there from the S U N Studios when they were revamping the IOD Studios and the whole staff went over to Tampa.

[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:36.460]
The hotel we were at was right across the street from the Del House.

[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:45.240]
And that's when the goddess Randy went over there and was looking for some ducky, broad, whatever.

[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:51.460]
I don't think there was a good move on her part because you already had me on the out of the closet, Fag.

[02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:54.080]
And I think that they tap audience starting.

[02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:58.540]
Oh, this is a bunch of all Faggots from Miami Jew Faggots, you know, like that.

[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:02.520]
We say we're partially correct, but I mean, I think they over did it.

[02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:03.160]
The goddess.

[02:29:03.580 --> 02:29:04.960]
Not that I'm blaming her for our failure.

[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:09.980]
I just don't think it was the right market for what we were doing.

[02:29:10.860 --> 02:29:11.480]
You know what I mean?

[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:12.280]
Probably not.

[02:29:13.340 --> 02:29:14.520]
Now, blah, blah, blah, blah on the other hand.

[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:15.280]
He was legendary.

[02:29:16.620 --> 02:29:18.140]
Do you know how we wound up at S U N?

[02:29:18.620 --> 02:29:18.720]
No.

[02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:22.200]
Having worked at F LA before that.

[02:29:22.900 --> 02:29:27.700]
And then I guess he had one of their, you know, one of the several gigantic fall outs with them back when it was J. Corps.

[02:29:27.900 --> 02:29:28.140]
Uh-huh.

[02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:35.840]
And he left and he retired from the business and he and his wife moved to somewhere, Bumfork, Iowa, somewhere in Iowa.

[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.460]
And he was no longer in a business.

[02:29:40.340 --> 02:29:46.460]
And so when they decided to simul cast, well, it was interesting the way that Cox Broadcasting did it because they announced to us,

[02:29:46.460 --> 02:29:50.500]
oh, we're going to be simul casting you guys in Tampa on WSU and we thought, oh, that's great.

[02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:51.740]
How much we getting paid for it?

[02:29:51.980 --> 02:29:53.660]
Oh, we thought about that.

[02:29:53.740 --> 02:29:54.280]
Yeah, it's true.

[02:29:54.920 --> 02:29:59.100]
They tried to swindle us into going on the year in another market without giving us any more money.

[02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:05.220]
And whatever the total amount was with some, I mean, like 200 bucks a week or some ridiculous token, you know, like pennies.

[02:30:06.820 --> 02:30:10.660]
And so they were putting me on in midday and I guess fill in the afternoon and Randy at night.

[02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:13.520]
And they didn't have a morning show.

[02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:16.160]
I think I know what happened to Rick and Suds at that point.

[02:30:17.820 --> 02:30:24.080]
But at any rate, so I said, last year was gigantic in this market on FLA, which he had been and I'm going to call him.

[02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:29.740]
And I called, I had his number or got it from somebody and called him in Iowa and talked him in to come and back down to Florida.

[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:30.180]
Wow.

[02:30:30.880 --> 02:30:33.120]
And that's how he wound up doing mornings on SUN.

[02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:36.040]
Which after then he left and I went back to FLA, right?

[02:30:36.620 --> 02:30:37.440]
I believe so.

[02:30:37.780 --> 02:30:41.580]
And then had another big falling out there and then went to WLS in Chicago.

[02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:44.160]
I can't keep track of it all.

[02:30:44.300 --> 02:30:45.320]
You know, like we're all gypsies.

[02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:47.580]
Everybody in this business is a gypsy like you.

[02:30:47.820 --> 02:30:48.360]
Yeah, for sure.

[02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:51.580]
Now where did you work before you worked on that station in Fort Myers?

[02:30:52.500 --> 02:30:52.680]
Tampa.

[02:30:54.600 --> 02:30:56.540]
I went Tampa for my ears down here.

[02:30:57.500 --> 02:30:59.640]
Oh, boy, you talk about moving down the ladder.

[02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:00.020]
Yeah.

[02:31:01.460 --> 02:31:03.520]
Tampa to Fort Myers to QAM.

[02:31:03.520 --> 02:31:08.040]
I mean, that is really a career disaster.

[02:31:08.340 --> 02:31:08.620]
Thanks.

[02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:09.960]
What?

[02:31:10.360 --> 02:31:11.140]
I said thanks.

[02:31:12.260 --> 02:31:13.480]
You're arguing with me about it?

[02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:14.080]
No, I'm not.

[02:31:14.180 --> 02:31:15.300]
You deny it?

[02:31:15.380 --> 02:31:16.440]
I don't.

[02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:19.280]
Tampa to Fort Myers to QAM.

[02:31:19.460 --> 02:31:22.040]
I mean, QAM once upon a time it would have been like a big boost.

[02:31:22.820 --> 02:31:24.280]
Miami, you know, like a real market.

[02:31:26.260 --> 02:31:30.940]
But under the Joe Belrejeeam, I mean, you're like pretty much off the air at this point.

[02:31:31.060 --> 02:31:31.840]
I know I sure am.

[02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:34.320]
Well, the worst part is when I lost mornings to Bubba.

[02:31:34.420 --> 02:31:37.620]
They actually offered me afternoon drives and I told him to stick it because I'm a morning guy.

[02:31:38.060 --> 02:31:39.280]
That's a great move.

[02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:39.740]
Well, Hank.

[02:31:40.220 --> 02:31:40.780]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:31:41.560 --> 02:31:43.820]
Now, you're yes, you never found anything about Hank falling asleep.

[02:31:44.080 --> 02:31:44.840]
No, I think it got deleted.

[02:31:46.080 --> 02:31:46.960]
Oh, here's one.

[02:31:47.060 --> 02:31:51.360]
It says sounds like you're jealous of syphilis and that he caught a 76 yard touchdown from David Woodley,

[02:31:51.460 --> 02:31:55.720]
which is the fifth longest in super bowl history and is sensitive when successful broadcast in career.

[02:31:56.120 --> 02:31:56.360]
Right.

[02:31:56.820 --> 02:32:00.580]
What's specifically about being an ex-jocque precludes one from being a good broadcaster?

[02:32:01.160 --> 02:32:02.420]
No, nothing specifically.

[02:32:02.820 --> 02:32:07.460]
There's like a Pat Someral who was a great sport broadcaster and a next jock.

[02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:14.540]
But in most cases, like Frank Gifford, he was a great football player and a horrible broadcaster.

[02:32:15.980 --> 02:32:17.560]
Horrendous, like Jimmy syphilis.

[02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:21.820]
Frank says, I moved away from Florida five years ago back to Maryland.

[02:32:21.820 --> 02:32:23.940]
I regret doing this because the winners appear are horrible.

[02:32:24.380 --> 02:32:28.060]
I moved out of Florida because the employment market was bleak at best with no money to be made.

[02:32:28.060 --> 02:32:29.940]
Why are you in Canada the worst time here?

[02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:30.900]
Because I choose to be.

[02:32:31.440 --> 02:32:35.500]
Because my choices are either being in Florida, my house or being here and I choose to be.

[02:32:36.020 --> 02:32:36.740]
How's that, Frank?

[02:32:37.460 --> 02:32:38.440]
Because I want to.

[02:32:38.540 --> 02:32:39.920]
I could be in South Florida right now.

[02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:41.540]
It would build a studio for me in my house.

[02:32:41.540 --> 02:32:42.220]
I'm sure, right?

[02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:44.960]
Everybody else in the station pretty much has got one.

[02:32:45.200 --> 02:32:45.500]
Mm-hmm.

[02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:47.100]
But I don't want to.

[02:32:48.160 --> 02:32:49.040]
I don't want to.

[02:32:49.180 --> 02:32:52.520]
And you know something, whether like I keep telling you, you get used to it and you dress for it.

[02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:56.840]
Like at two o'clock, I got some chores I got to do and I'll do them.

[02:32:57.460 --> 02:32:58.440]
Chores, you know what I mean?

[02:32:58.960 --> 02:33:03.340]
Like actually putting on my clothes and putting on my heavy coat and going outside and doing crap.

[02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:04.620]
What the fuck is that?

[02:33:04.860 --> 02:33:05.700]
The best talent.

[02:33:05.940 --> 02:33:06.480]
You don't have to.

[02:33:06.860 --> 02:33:06.860]

[02:33:07.660 --> 02:33:10.480]
How young is too young if you can spot the fat one?

[02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:34.080]
Who's that man on in the morning?

[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:38.600]
Six to ten on S.U.N.

[02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:44.440]
He's the guy the next time, Delaware's cry.

[02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:50.220]
He likes to think he's number one, blah, blah.

[02:33:51.780 --> 02:33:55.080]
He's bigger than the postblah, blah.

[02:33:56.380 --> 02:33:59.880]
His eyelids are the most blah, blah.

[02:34:01.140 --> 02:34:04.820]
The biggest man in radio today.

[02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:06.640]
Oh, fuck.

[02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:12.180]
He plays the songs that make you sleepy.

[02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:16.860]
He steals material from me.

[02:34:18.540 --> 02:34:22.780]
He gives the time and the weather's looking fine.

[02:34:22.780 --> 02:34:28.580]
His jobs have played the song again, blah, blah.

[02:34:29.980 --> 02:34:33.460]
He's bigger than the postblah, blah.

[02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:38.240]
His eyelids are the most blah, blah.

[02:34:39.500 --> 02:34:43.100]
The biggest man in radio today.

[02:34:47.540 --> 02:34:51.100]
Let's make the sun, our sister station.

[02:34:52.300 --> 02:34:55.160]
And bring the blob in here today.

[02:34:57.380 --> 02:35:01.080]
And if the clap man could lose another kid.

[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:07.000]
He'd have more boring songs to play, blah, blah.

[02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:11.840]
He's bigger than the postblah, blah.

[02:35:13.100 --> 02:35:16.640]
His eyelids are the most blah, blah.

[02:35:17.860 --> 02:35:21.740]
The biggest man in radio today.

[02:35:24.580 --> 02:35:26.220]
Blah, blah.

[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:31.000]
He's bigger than the postblah, blah.

[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:35.860]
His eyelids are the most blah, blah.

[02:35:37.780 --> 02:35:41.840]
The biggest man in radio today.

[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:44.800]
133 at QIM.

[02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:47.220]
So, what Brandon says, I remember the story.

[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:49.280]
Brandon this and Brandon that and Brandon that.

[02:35:49.340 --> 02:35:51.200]
Well, at least he knows what else is going on.

[02:35:52.500 --> 02:35:56.000]
Bob went from Tampa to Chicago to Davenport, Iowa, and then back to Tampa.

[02:35:56.740 --> 02:35:59.400]
And the show that you and he did together in Tampa is a classic.

[02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:01.120]
The audio of the show is on his site.

[02:36:01.660 --> 02:36:04.400]
With the dueling carts, the deli food, the bird-ropping buy.

[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:07.080]
And the opening was the best Bob tried to do a normal show open.

[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:10.240]
And he interrupt him to say how the hell can checkers be the number on burger in Tampa.

[02:36:10.580 --> 02:36:11.240]
We had a lot of fun.

[02:36:12.300 --> 02:36:13.140]
It was a fun week.

[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:14.960]
And the bird kept showing up every day.

[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:17.980]
And then last year, Captain Sistine, I mean, not that I had to do it,

[02:36:17.980 --> 02:36:20.420]
but it was just he was insistent that I show up.

[02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:21.760]
His show was like six to ten.

[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:26.020]
And I was going to do a little crossover with him, you know, from like 945 to 10.

[02:36:27.100 --> 02:36:29.120]
And he kept insisting I show up like at eight in the morning.

[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:32.440]
So I was winding up doing six hours every day.

[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:35.700]
You following me or did you leave?

[02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:36.400]
No, I'm following.

[02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:39.760]
Oh, you don't seem too interested in that old SUN stuff.

[02:36:39.900 --> 02:36:41.300]
No, I like it because I lived it.

[02:36:41.880 --> 02:36:42.540]
You lived it?

[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:43.320]
I lived it too.

[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:43.560]
Yeah.

[02:36:45.220 --> 02:36:46.920]
And then we did the appearance of that mall.

[02:36:47.060 --> 02:36:47.900]
What the mall was that?

[02:36:48.180 --> 02:36:48.440]
Which one?

[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:49.920]
What was it?

[02:36:50.520 --> 02:36:50.840]
What?

[02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:51.140]
What?

[02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:51.380]
What's your?

[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:52.880]
I don't know what the name of it was.

[02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:55.080]
But like 5,000 people showed up.

[02:36:55.780 --> 02:36:59.480]
For me and Phil and Blabo and Randy.

[02:37:00.500 --> 02:37:02.280]
I wonder where the hell Rick and Spud were at that time.

[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:05.440]
I just can't get my bearings on where the hell they were.

[02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:11.800]
So Jimmy D says everyone who thinks the show sucks are failing to realize that they're still listening.

[02:37:12.340 --> 02:37:13.580]
Change the channel if you don't like it.

[02:37:13.700 --> 02:37:16.060]
You idiots, you simple things, you quizlings, you fairies.

[02:37:16.180 --> 02:37:16.800]
You fairies.

[02:37:17.080 --> 02:37:18.820]
Your show is the only thing I listen to on terrestrial.

[02:37:18.820 --> 02:37:21.240]
Once more, once I'm done listening, I turn off the radio.

[02:37:21.860 --> 02:37:27.360]
After I got sick of Howard and Bubba, shmitting all over their paying customers, I shut off my serious and have it listen since.

[02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:31.320]
Do these colostomy bags also purposely eat food they don't like and then complain to the chef?

[02:37:32.020 --> 02:37:36.300]
These guys should get a hobby like doing crossword puzzles, building model their plans or attempting suicide.

[02:37:36.740 --> 02:37:38.280]
I like that last one Jimmy sounds good.

[02:37:39.340 --> 02:37:43.240]
Forward their emails to the complaint department as most people call it, the trash bin.

[02:37:44.940 --> 02:37:50.420]
Like that 80 page facts you got this morning about solving the economy, solving the all that crap.

[02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:55.660]
Some of the stuff, well you'll see as time goes on once you take Georgia's job.

[02:37:56.960 --> 02:37:58.480]
You'll see the stuff that comes in.

[02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:01.940]
By the way, I fact you over the menu for the restaurant.

[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:03.180]
Yeah, thank you so much.

[02:38:03.220 --> 02:38:04.280]
I put it right here in my point.

[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:06.180]
Looks really incredible for E. Corcini.

[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:07.880]
Thank you.

[02:38:08.140 --> 02:38:14.360]
All kinds of pasta, soups, fabulous antiposti, E. Corcini.

[02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:15.740]
That's our restaurant tomorrow, our meal.

[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:17.560]
50% off deal.

[02:38:19.780 --> 02:38:20.500]
Oh, Bob.

[02:38:21.340 --> 02:38:21.700]
Bob.

[02:38:22.100 --> 02:38:23.040]
We have a fire alarm.

[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:26.640]
Yeah.

[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:29.200]
Is this a test or is this like a real one?

[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:31.760]
Of course, if we ever have a real one, we're making a difference anyhow.

[02:38:32.140 --> 02:38:33.240]
At least it's not super annoying.

[02:38:33.820 --> 02:38:34.360]
It's not what?

[02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:35.080]
Super annoying.

[02:38:35.740 --> 02:38:38.140]
No, it isn't to you because you're hearing it like through the door.

[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:38.760]
That's true.

[02:38:39.300 --> 02:38:42.000]
I'll close the door in a second and you won't hear it probably at all but nevertheless.

[02:38:43.020 --> 02:38:44.500]
Attention plays, your attention plays.

[02:38:44.500 --> 02:38:46.020]
This is hysterical building management.

[02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:48.580]
We have another phone call or else it's a test.

[02:38:49.980 --> 02:38:51.140]
Beep beep beep.

[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:57.480]
This was supposed to be like tomorrow between 230 and 3 was what it said on the Abolitan board tomorrow.

[02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.080]
I'm sure this must be their test.

[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:01.660]
Do you want me to close the door as an little ambiance to the show?

[02:39:01.860 --> 02:39:02.420]
I think it's nice.

[02:39:03.060 --> 02:39:03.480]
Is it?

[02:39:03.700 --> 02:39:03.820]
No.

[02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:06.420]
Beep.

[02:39:08.020 --> 02:39:10.440]
Here's a great idea for your show as one of the chronics.

[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:15.600]
How about you and your sidekick pretended to be a subject and listeners will pretend to like it.

[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:16.440]
Beep beep beep.

[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:17.760]
Is that cute or what?

[02:39:18.780 --> 02:39:20.180]
Do I detect a notice or a cast?

[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:21.140]
And then I'm going to close the door.

[02:39:21.620 --> 02:39:21.900]
Okay.

[02:39:22.660 --> 02:39:24.000]
Oh my god.

[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:26.480]
Stop all of it.

[02:39:27.300 --> 02:39:28.200]
Can you hear it now?

[02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:30.000]
Barely.

[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:30.900]
Just barely.

[02:39:31.380 --> 02:39:32.220]
I hear it.

[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:33.100]
I heard plenty loud.

[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:35.280]
Beep beep beep.

[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:37.820]
Maybe that's for the, um, I'm your bitch guy.

[02:39:37.980 --> 02:39:39.240]
Beep beep beep.

[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:39.300]
Yeah.

[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:43.160]
Maybe they've had an, uh, sound effect in the building for, uh, no extra charge.

[02:39:44.020 --> 02:39:44.880]
Jane and dear for you.

[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:50.040]
Now that this goes to show you that there are people out there who just don't get it.

[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:52.560]
I mean, Jane's been listening a long time and she's wonderful and all that.

[02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:55.860]
But she says, I think you should stay home today. It's way too snowy up there.

[02:39:56.180 --> 02:39:57.000]
No, I'm not staying home.

[02:39:57.080 --> 02:39:57.740]
I have stuff to do.

[02:39:57.840 --> 02:39:59.160]
I have stuff I have to walk to do.

[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:00.020]
I'm not driving anywhere.

[02:40:01.420 --> 02:40:03.060]
Your producer guy didn't get his name.

[02:40:03.700 --> 02:40:05.460]
Flea asked if you paid your electric bill.

[02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:06.940]
See what I mean?

[02:40:07.540 --> 02:40:07.940]
Mm-hmm.

[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:09.320]
I hope so.

[02:40:09.420 --> 02:40:11.960]
The news, uh, on the news they found an 82 year old W. W.

[02:40:12.100 --> 02:40:13.500]
Two veteran frozen it at the Somino High.

[02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:15.720]
First of all, the guy was 93 and it was in Michigan.

[02:40:16.700 --> 02:40:21.060]
And I have paid my electric bill that it was a comment about Joe Rose and the way he says

[02:40:21.060 --> 02:40:25.680]
those words, the electric bill without the first E. His power was cut off because he didn't

[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:26.100]
pay his bill.

[02:40:26.140 --> 02:40:26.580]
What a country.

[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:28.100]
The guy was 93 and was Michigan.

[02:40:28.100 --> 02:40:28.880]
We talked about yesterday.

[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:29.920]
Love Jane and dear Phil.

[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:30.440]
Thanks, Jane.

[02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:32.660]
But boy, you're confused, honey.

[02:40:33.180 --> 02:40:33.780]
She's confused.

[02:40:33.940 --> 02:40:35.040]
A lot of pressure being in dear Phil.

[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:35.620]
I'm sure that.

[02:40:37.180 --> 02:40:37.940]
887 on the pool.

[02:40:38.100 --> 02:40:39.720]
We need 13 more for 900 today.

[02:40:39.780 --> 02:40:41.220]
That would be a real feather in flea's cap.

[02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:44.380]
Because we sure don't get no 900 when George does this show.

[02:40:44.540 --> 02:40:45.360]
George is out sick today.

[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:47.060]
He'll be back tomorrow for the free food for me.

[02:40:47.180 --> 02:40:47.520]
Corsini.

[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:53.420]
Vinyan Coconut Creek says, why the hell do people care where you live and broadcast from?

[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:54.420]
They shouldn't.

[02:40:54.500 --> 02:40:55.660]
It's just an excuse to be negative.

[02:40:56.340 --> 02:40:59.460]
Just as long as you continue to make his life and preach to all the religious lemmings

[02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:02.240]
out there, can people just let you be for Christ's sake?

[02:41:02.340 --> 02:41:02.440]
No.

[02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:06.600]
I could care less if you did the show from undersea cave, although it sounds like it sometimes.

[02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:07.960]
Just keep keeping it real.

[02:41:08.540 --> 02:41:09.600]
Says Vinyan Coconut Creek.

[02:41:09.740 --> 02:41:10.720]
Thanks, Vinyan.

[02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:11.600]
And the alarm stopped.

[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:13.820]
And you notice they didn't say anything.

[02:41:14.540 --> 02:41:15.300]
So what does that mean?

[02:41:18.020 --> 02:41:20.160]
It means that who knows?

[02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:21.080]
Do you think I care?

[02:41:21.820 --> 02:41:25.260]
You think if they ever had like a real fire in this building, any of us would get out alive anyway?

[02:41:29.780 --> 02:41:30.280]
I don't know.

[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:32.780]
I got like my t-shirt and my walking shorts on.

[02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:38.420]
Do you think that I would end my slippers as little flippers?

[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:42.960]
Do you think that I would schlep down all the flights of stairs?

[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:43.360]
No.

[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:48.140]
To go outside in the freezing cold and snow and stand out there and wait and wait and wait.

[02:41:48.380 --> 02:41:50.480]
Because you got to go outside to get back in the front of the building.

[02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:55.020]
When you get to the bottom of the last floor when you go down the stairs,

[02:41:55.580 --> 02:41:57.940]
because I've done it, you wind up outside.

[02:41:59.220 --> 02:42:03.780]
And then you got to go around about about a half a block and come back in the entrance to the building.

[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:05.280]
That sucks.

[02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:10.740]
So I'd rather die from smoke inhalation, something more pleasant like that, than going outside in this.

[02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:12.540]
What the heck is this?

[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:13.540]
You got to point to it.

[02:42:13.780 --> 02:42:15.080]
You don't have your new Rogers.

[02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:17.080]
Oh God.

[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:56.140]
Oh God.

[02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:22.580]
Can you best leave that foam to me?

[02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:27.020]
I'll tell you one thing we sure learned a lot about Tampa Rated today,

[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:28.100]
whether we want to know it or not.

[02:43:28.460 --> 02:43:29.220]
Thanks to Flea.

[02:43:29.300 --> 02:43:29.460]
Yep.

[02:43:30.580 --> 02:43:32.160]
Well, see, I didn't know about any of this crap.

[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:35.720]
What a tremendous insight Flea has brought to us.

[02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:37.280]
He'll be back again tomorrow for the free food.

[02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:37.760]
I hope.

[02:43:38.700 --> 02:43:39.380]
You hope what?

[02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:40.420]
I hope I get some free food.

[02:43:40.500 --> 02:43:41.580]
You hope George is sick again tomorrow?

[02:43:41.820 --> 02:43:42.620]
No, I just want the free food.

[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:43.120]
Oh.

[02:43:43.820 --> 02:43:44.520]
That's what I thought.

[02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:46.420]
Especially after the interview.

[02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:47.040]

[02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:48.440]
Marginally interesting one.

[02:43:49.460 --> 02:43:51.480]
Nio, did you see Mickey Rook on Larry King last night?

[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:53.960]
No, I don't watch Larry King, and I certainly wouldn't watch Mickey Rook.

[02:43:54.600 --> 02:43:56.120]
Seems like a great comeback story.

[02:43:56.480 --> 02:43:58.940]
You imply that you don't like him, so you have some history with him?

[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:00.680]
No, I don't know him, and I don't want to know him.

[02:44:00.780 --> 02:44:01.480]
He's a slime bucket.

[02:44:02.020 --> 02:44:03.260]
Or at least he impresses me as such.

[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:04.360]
I don't want nothing to do with him.

[02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:06.820]
I always see him around South Beach.

[02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:09.440]
Flea probably sees him there, too, although not at the doose.

[02:44:09.700 --> 02:44:10.480]
What is the doose?

[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:11.860]
Max is a doose bar.

[02:44:11.860 --> 02:44:13.060]
It's a dial on South Beach.

[02:44:13.380 --> 02:44:14.200]
Max is doose bar?

[02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:14.580]
Yep.

[02:44:14.980 --> 02:44:15.860]
What do you do there?

[02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:16.220]
Doose?

[02:44:16.420 --> 02:44:16.820]
Yep.

[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:19.080]
And drink.

[02:44:19.460 --> 02:44:20.520]
Do you see Mickey Rook around?

[02:44:21.060 --> 02:44:22.480]
No, but I've seen Lenny Kravitz in there.

[02:44:23.180 --> 02:44:23.560]
No!

[02:44:24.140 --> 02:44:24.440]
Woo!

[02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:26.620]
Now you're talking.

[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:30.440]
Name dropper.

[02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:33.200]
So you're auditioning, I can tell already.

[02:44:34.100 --> 02:44:35.380]
No, you're auditioning, Lately.

[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:36.860]
Who's the biggest name dropper in the mall?

[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:37.680]
Hank Leroy King.

[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:39.140]
Or Flea.

[02:44:43.520 --> 02:44:45.340]
Now did you ever read it, Joe Stone Kravitz?

[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:45.840]
Yes.

[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:47.660]
Because we talked about that yesterday.

[02:44:47.860 --> 02:44:48.680]
And what's your take?

[02:44:49.180 --> 02:44:49.420]
Overrated.

[02:44:52.160 --> 02:44:52.560]
Good.

[02:44:52.700 --> 02:44:52.920]
Oh!

[02:44:53.260 --> 02:44:54.200]
Good, but overrated.

[02:44:54.980 --> 02:44:55.300]
Really?

[02:44:55.580 --> 02:44:55.700]
Yeah.

[02:44:55.700 --> 02:44:57.440]
And you have to smear the matronate to get seated?

[02:44:57.700 --> 02:44:57.980]
Oh, yeah.

[02:44:58.520 --> 02:44:59.080]
You did?

[02:44:59.280 --> 02:45:01.060]
I didn't, but you know I went with record guys who did.

[02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:02.000]
Oh.

[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:04.280]
That guy makes six figures cash easy.

[02:45:06.420 --> 02:45:07.260]
Brandon is back.

[02:45:07.260 --> 02:45:08.960]
Again, Brandon, you got to cut it down.

[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:11.280]
Cut it down to at least 40, 50 times today.

[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:13.220]
This will be my last note for the day,

[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:14.360]
even though it's the end already.

[02:45:14.980 --> 02:45:17.620]
The saddest moment and most real moment I've ever heard on your show

[02:45:17.620 --> 02:45:20.620]
was the day you called up, lasted, or patched things up.

[02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:22.360]
And after the time he was like on his deathbed.

[02:45:24.660 --> 02:45:27.040]
That's why it was a nice little chat that you had.

[02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:28.460]
It was really sad to hear Bob talk.

[02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:30.180]
He could hit no energy.

[02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:31.100]
He was dying.

[02:45:32.500 --> 02:45:34.280]
And he barely could speak the words.

[02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:35.620]
It was very sad.

[02:45:37.220 --> 02:45:38.700]
So like I said, yeah, it was sad.

[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:40.960]
Let's not end on a sour down note.

[02:45:41.720 --> 02:45:44.180]
Neil God, I left South Florida 20 years ago listening to you

[02:45:44.180 --> 02:45:46.640]
slowly fade on my FM as I headed north on 95.

[02:45:47.220 --> 02:45:49.180]
I rediscovered you on the internet about two years ago.

[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:50.420]
And you're still killing it.

[02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:51.080]
Yeah, I'm killing it.

[02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:51.440]
All right.

[02:45:51.620 --> 02:45:52.400]
They're killing me.

[02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:55.320]
I have a life and catch you when I can.

[02:45:55.420 --> 02:45:56.020]
Keep up the good work.

[02:45:56.260 --> 02:45:56.980]
Keep the teacher.

[02:45:57.420 --> 02:45:57.680]
Keith.

[02:45:58.860 --> 02:46:01.080]
PS Virginia's weather beats South Florida by a mile.

[02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:03.640]
Virginia, I don't think I'd want to be in Virginia.

[02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:05.380]
Would you?

[02:46:05.900 --> 02:46:06.080]
Nope.

[02:46:09.380 --> 02:46:11.580]
I'm trying to think of a state where I would want to live in.

[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:14.560]
I can't think of one.

[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:16.520]
Maybe Massachusetts.

[02:46:16.820 --> 02:46:19.240]
If I could turn the clock back, I'd love to live in Boston again.

[02:46:19.300 --> 02:46:20.920]
Like back when I was there in the early 60s.

[02:46:20.940 --> 02:46:21.200]
Great.

[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:21.840]
Great city.

[02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:22.500]
Wow.

[02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:24.560]
Still a great city, but not like it was.

[02:46:24.780 --> 02:46:25.860]
No places like it was.

[02:46:28.700 --> 02:46:29.420]
898 in the pool.

[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:30.160]
We're going to do 900.

[02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:33.120]
And Georgia's going to be really feeling bummed out when he finds out

[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:34.960]
we did 900 on the pool with flea here today.

[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:36.500]
Georgia's here.

[02:46:36.520 --> 02:46:37.600]
We're lucky to get 100 votes.

[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:39.400]
We're lucky to get 20.

[02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:41.880]
That was up 185, by the way, speaking of numbers.

[02:46:42.420 --> 02:46:44.780]
Who's this, the White House spokesman now?

[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:48.080]
Was to ensure the safety of our defense.

[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:50.380]
Press spokesman will remove our combat brigades.

[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:52.860]
This guy is pasty and I don't know.

[02:46:53.140 --> 02:46:55.420]
He doesn't seem like the kind of guy that Obama would put in there.

[02:46:55.900 --> 02:47:00.120]
The responsibility and the opportunity for the Iraqis to do more.

[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:01.660]
I don't know.

[02:47:01.860 --> 02:47:02.500]
I don't know.

[02:47:02.580 --> 02:47:02.660]
I don't know.

[02:47:02.660 --> 02:47:03.740]
As I said to do this in a way.

[02:47:03.760 --> 02:47:05.240]
I'll say that for him.

[02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:05.880]
Not a bad piece.

[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:10.360]
The process began on the 21st as you guys know in the situation.

[02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:14.980]
And today at the Pentagon, I think there will be at least one more meeting.

[02:47:15.140 --> 02:47:16.480]
I'm doing that extra love for that one guy.

[02:47:16.700 --> 02:47:19.600]
The fire alarm stopped and they never even made an announcement.

[02:47:20.380 --> 02:47:21.700]
They never said, oh, sorry.

[02:47:21.860 --> 02:47:26.520]
This was a false alarm or always screwed up or the world is coming to an end or anything.

[02:47:27.780 --> 02:47:28.480]
It just went.

[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:30.940]
I really think they did that for the.

[02:47:32.220 --> 02:47:33.180]
You're my bitch guy.

[02:47:34.460 --> 02:47:36.440]
They're trying to find some sound effects for the show now.

[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:37.120]
That last break.

[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:38.680]
Check it for me is four minutes, right?

[02:47:39.580 --> 02:47:40.220]
Yes, it is.

[02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:42.660]
Because lately what they've been doing for some strange reason.

[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:46.940]
They've been overselling and they've had like an extra, either an extra promo or an extra spot in there.

[02:47:47.220 --> 02:47:52.680]
And then when I try to back time the show, it's like, oh gee, I got to change the thing all of a sudden because I realized we got an extra spot.

[02:47:52.740 --> 02:47:54.260]
That is not my log.

[02:47:54.260 --> 02:47:58.660]
That would be a promo and I've made sure that it doesn't go into that stop set anymore.

[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:02.040]
Ever dump the promo for this homo.

[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:04.620]
Will you please done and we don't want to hear it no more.

[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:09.420]
Oh, here you go.

[02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:11.040]
It says Schmidt is lucky.

[02:48:11.260 --> 02:48:12.400]
He's not up against you.

[02:48:12.820 --> 02:48:15.260]
Wish Veezy would buy a station to hear and put you back on.

[02:48:15.500 --> 02:48:16.000]
Trust me.

[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:16.840]
You are missed here.

[02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:20.640]
So would the locals say, well, if I'm so missed there, how come our numbers were so weak in Tampa?

[02:48:20.980 --> 02:48:21.420]
All of us.

[02:48:22.260 --> 02:48:26.220]
In the beginning, it looked like we were going to make an impact there and then that was the end of that.

[02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:32.180]
To flee, wife and I went to a few 98 crock appearances, never got a t-shirt.

[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:34.060]
Always seemed to have just run out.

[02:48:35.020 --> 02:48:37.540]
Got a crap load of front tags and stickers still.

[02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:38.780]
Scott and Pinellas Park.

[02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:39.640]
How do you like that?

[02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:40.520]
Some of your old listeners.

[02:48:40.780 --> 02:48:41.780]
Ooh, in Pinellas Park.

[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:45.300]
You're my bitches back.

[02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:46.280]
Slurp, slurp.

[02:48:46.420 --> 02:48:47.000]
You know what that was?

[02:48:47.220 --> 02:48:50.520]
That was the sound of all the ass sucking going on here today from your e-mailers.

[02:48:50.980 --> 02:48:52.680]
Jesus, this is all butt sucking radio.

[02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:55.640]
How can these idiots breathe with their heads rammed so far up your ass?

[02:48:56.180 --> 02:48:57.300]
They like the aroma.

[02:48:59.020 --> 02:49:00.380]
Change the station, you say, Jimmy.

[02:49:00.820 --> 02:49:02.440]
Please tell me, Schmidt for Brains.

[02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:03.720]
Change it to what?

[02:49:03.940 --> 02:49:05.560]
Which one of the other two English stations?

[02:49:06.260 --> 02:49:08.220]
Fat moron, rush or more sports?

[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:08.920]
You're an idiot.

[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:09.820]
You should just shut up.

[02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:13.500]
You're just trying to get your crap read on the air so you can get your jollies off.

[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:14.220]
No, Neil.

[02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:15.320]
Not your jollies off.

[02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:15.980]
Baaah!

[02:49:16.300 --> 02:49:16.700]
Baaah!

[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:18.600]
Says, uh, you're my bitch.

[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:22.520]
902 on the pole.

[02:49:22.620 --> 02:49:22.800]
Oh!

[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:23.860]
We done it.

[02:49:23.980 --> 02:49:25.380]
Thanks to, uh, please help.

[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:28.720]
Aren't you proud?

[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:30.300]
Yeah, now Joyce is killing George.

[02:49:31.360 --> 02:49:34.380]
Is she, did she pass yours like he was laying flat out, which he probably is today?

[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:35.660]
122 to 104.

[02:49:36.580 --> 02:49:40.980]
What would your critique of, uh, B, if Neil allowed it on the air?

[02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:42.340]
I still don't like that last part of it.

[02:49:42.580 --> 02:49:43.720]
And Charlie, he'd never apologize.

[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:45.360]
He doesn't realize how stupid that sound.

[02:49:45.640 --> 02:49:46.820]
If I allowed it on the air.

[02:49:47.180 --> 02:49:49.920]
Like, I only read ass sucking comments like, like,

[02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:52.480]
I just read that, that other one from your my bitch.

[02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:53.940]
I read them all pretty much.

[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:57.880]
No complaints to end of 35, but that dropped to 37%.

[02:49:57.880 --> 02:50:00.940]
Too much censorship, too much Joyce 122.

[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:05.100]
Well, that's the reason the other one dropped is because we put that on late and it went zooming up there.

[02:50:06.180 --> 02:50:07.060]
George 104.

[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:07.940]
You're right.

[02:50:08.060 --> 02:50:11.140]
George, George got passed by Joyce like he was in a coma.

[02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:15.980]
The repeating stream archive, uh, live commercials 87.

[02:50:17.180 --> 02:50:18.640]
Not enough calls 75.

[02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:20.060]
Too bad didn't take any of the day.

[02:50:20.180 --> 02:50:20.640]
Did we?

[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:22.180]
I'm your friend.

[02:50:22.380 --> 02:50:23.300]
There you go.

[02:50:23.660 --> 02:50:25.020]
Neil's not in Miami 64.

[02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:26.980]
Neil's mailing it in 43.

[02:50:27.380 --> 02:50:28.880]
Too many fake emailers 32.

[02:50:29.500 --> 02:50:30.900]
Too much slots talk 17.

[02:50:31.220 --> 02:50:32.920]
Oh, I sure must have 17 to quarter.

[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.280]
Shot guy not the quarter.

[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:39.220]
Shot guy eating on the year 16 and too much food talk only seven.

[02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:43.980]
So if you go from the bottom, we ought to have more food talk and more eating on the air.

[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:45.660]
And a lot more slot talk.

[02:50:46.320 --> 02:50:47.980]
When a guy from Gulf, he was a good guy.

[02:50:48.100 --> 02:50:49.560]
What was his name that the Italian guy?

[02:50:49.740 --> 02:50:53.360]
Don't remember that George was making fun of when he talked him last Friday.

[02:50:53.540 --> 02:50:56.460]
I should have asked him about some of the intricacies.

[02:50:56.700 --> 02:51:00.100]
Nobody will ever tell you, you know, because I think they'll get killed if they tell you the real story.

[02:51:00.500 --> 02:51:04.540]
About the way that they program them and shut them down and put them on slow cook.

[02:51:04.940 --> 02:51:08.660]
And you're like feeding it's like taking the money and putting into it like a waste basket.

[02:51:10.260 --> 02:51:13.240]
Beating, feeding, feeding, feeding, feeding.

[02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:17.700]
It's day, oh my every tell.

[02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:19.420]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:51:19.420 --> 02:51:22.800]
At 5.6.0 WQ.A.L.

[02:51:24.400 --> 02:51:25.360]
Oh, oh.

[02:51:28.200 --> 02:51:31.740]
I like Bill Clinton and Saadi Doritos.

[02:51:32.020 --> 02:51:34.800]
My fingers turn orange when I eat that Cheetos.

[02:51:35.100 --> 02:51:37.880]
I don't like Bruno Trump and Mary Juice.

[02:51:37.880 --> 02:51:41.420]
They make me feel funny in the anus.

[02:51:42.120 --> 02:51:43.400]
So we're filling.

[02:51:44.060 --> 02:51:47.300]
I like the women who have their small buses.

[02:51:47.800 --> 02:51:50.620]
I don't like the father and son George Bush's.

[02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:56.700]
I pass time by watching the Brady Bonds while eating the Kellogg's Raisin Grand Crunch.

[02:51:58.360 --> 02:52:01.600]
I use the Irish spring, I love the ladder.

[02:52:02.080 --> 02:52:04.800]
My favorite newsman was honest and rather.

[02:52:04.800 --> 02:52:08.120]
I wash my hands with hokey baby wives.

[02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:11.540]
I hope they make play for with Wesley Snipes.

[02:52:11.640 --> 02:52:14.500]
My life's crappy, I'm not happy.

[02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:17.120]
Killing such a pain.

[02:52:17.580 --> 02:52:20.420]
One day I'll get out and we'll be back in charge.

[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:22.080]
I am so down.

[02:52:23.360 --> 02:52:24.400]
Who say?

[02:52:26.300 --> 02:52:27.300]
How you doing?

[02:52:28.140 --> 02:52:29.360]
Better than me I bet.

[02:52:30.700 --> 02:52:33.380]
This process or person thing, but.

[02:52:33.380 --> 02:52:35.700]
I do my best and I'm talking about.

[02:52:36.680 --> 02:52:39.800]
Getting a clean pair of undies is my goal.

[02:52:40.120 --> 02:52:42.940]
This place is worse than that filthy spider hole.

[02:52:43.380 --> 02:52:45.920]
I'm as emailing my good friends on hand.

[02:52:46.420 --> 02:52:49.080]
We used to I am sometimes until 10.

[02:52:52.420 --> 02:52:55.580]
I do my laundry and give the guards advice.

[02:52:55.940 --> 02:52:58.760]
I save my beard, touch the thing, wash fall off lights.

[02:52:59.160 --> 02:53:01.700]
I'm not as pretty as I used to be.

[02:53:01.700 --> 02:53:04.880]
I'm as watching out judge here on TV.

[02:53:05.400 --> 02:53:07.720]
Oh, it's the chosen of chill.

[02:53:08.260 --> 02:53:11.280]
But this is my life now until my trial.

[02:53:11.720 --> 02:53:14.400]
Looking like hell smelling like a poop pile.

[02:53:14.740 --> 02:53:17.440]
Don't have my snare master or my free weight.

[02:53:17.800 --> 02:53:20.680]
I miss my hair a minute, my golden age.

[02:53:21.280 --> 02:53:23.940]
My life's crappy, I'm not happy.

[02:53:24.400 --> 02:53:26.480]
Killing such a pain.

[02:53:26.940 --> 02:53:30.100]
But one day I'll get out and we'll be back in charge.

[02:53:30.100 --> 02:53:31.760]
I am so dumb.

[02:53:32.340 --> 02:53:33.920]
Oh, who say?

[02:53:35.940 --> 02:53:38.020]
I am so dumb.

[02:53:38.400 --> 02:53:40.080]
Bye, bye, bye.
