[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]
The music's pressed on the music.

[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.740]
Got some great news folks.

[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.140]
Gary Sarner's gone again.

[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.020]
Oh, right.

[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.880]
It was like those of the Beasley Brackess group.

[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.460]
Hi, Gary.

[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.500]
Don't come back this time.

[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.140]
Everybody here.

[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.980]
You're listening to South Road is sported.

[00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.840]
5, 6, 7, WQM Miami Fort Lauderdale.

[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.360]
Now if rodeo ritmo can just not get a bunch of wired diaries again today, we might move up a slot.

[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.880]
You think?

[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.400]
I don't know.

[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.900]
5, ratings day, ratings day, the Neil Raiday, Mayday.

[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.080]
ratings day, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 in date and Broward.

[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.360]
In other counties, called toll free.

[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.540]
8, 7, 7, 7, and 3, 5, 60 in the audience.

[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.380]
Well, let's have a party.

[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.120]
5, 60, 180 in T and Verizon Wireless phones.

[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.820]
The opinion is expressed by...

[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.340]
That's a good morning to everybody in the business.

[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.960]
He's tuning in waiting for the ratings.

[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.680]
So, WQM, ready for the waiting.

[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.220]
Wait for the staff.

[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.320]
Wait for the waiting.

[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.380]
Now, the Neil Rogers show on 5, 60 WQM.

[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.020]
You get a lot of bands.

[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.860]
Let's do it.

[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.560]
All right.

[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.140]
The New Rogers on Sports Hole Radio.

[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.960]
WQM.

[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.160]
Yeah!

[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.300]
Yeah!

[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.880]
Yeah!

[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.880]

[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.880]
In India, we like to drink.

[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.060]
So, Dad, Dad has some peace.

[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.420]
But now, we conserve funky stuff.

[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.980]
That's made with bovine wheeze.

[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.100]
I'd like to teach the world to drink.

[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.900]
Drink with me.

[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.940]
A glass of some coffee.

[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.760]
You never go back to drinking coke.

[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.680]
Cause cow urine's tasty.

[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.280]
It's not a routine.

[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.460]
Caught me.

[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.180]
Convince on today.

[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.080]
It is very salty.

[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.720]
It's not a routine.

[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.520]
Don't forget to ask your grosser about that.

[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.400]
Oh, my God.

[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.880]
What happened?

[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.700]
There's a long email from Brandon on here this morning.

[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.160]
You know, our close personal friend Brandon.

[00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.520]
Yes.

[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.380]
It's just, it's all I'll get to it.

[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.240]
I'll print it out.

[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.200]
Something about Lanciter.

[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.300]
Really?

[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.280]
Oh, my God.

[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.400]
Two interesting audio clips.

[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.020]
One of which is from 93 when you were talking to Randy,

[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.220]
who was in studio about how much you both disliked Bob Lanciter.

[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.560]
You were ripping him a new one.

[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.960]
And then the next one is from 95 when Bob got a call from a listener

[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.480]
and set him off when he found out you were in the hospital.

[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.980]
And Bob went off yelling and screaming that he hates the listeners

[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.540]
and ever going to S.U.N.

[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.140]
because of his friend's trip with you.

[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.020]
I'll just print it out.

[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.940]
I, boy, Brandon.

[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.600]
I thought Brandon had a life.

[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.440]
God.

[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.180]
Anyway, Gary Sarner's out again.

[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.900]
I guess he came back and they didn't give him the deal he wanted.

[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.800]
He's in.

[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.180]
He's out.

[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.560]
He's in.

[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.960]
He's out.

[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.380]
Good news is right now.

[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.920]
He's out.

[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.740]
Welcome.

[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.240]
Yeah.

[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.060]
The fake J. Friedman says,

[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.120]
when is Joe Rose going to get it that nobody cares about ice hockey?

[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.400]
Ice hockey.

[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.400]
Is he getting paid off for talking about hockey?

[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.900]
Shameful.

[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.960]
Well, guess what?

[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.300]
Whoever sent this, we got four major sports in South Florida.

[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.820]
The Panthers are one of them.

[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.040]
And by the way, they're going to get nothing for J. Bomis during July.

[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.780]
He's going to fly the coop and sign with somebody else

[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.120]
and they're going to get nothing in exchange for him.

[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.680]
Which was a bad deal, but nevertheless.

[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.220]
I like the way the interview with Jack Martin ended there with dial tone.

[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.420]
I wonder if that was intentional or what?

[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.760]
I don't know.

[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.020]
I think, uh, no, I don't think so.

[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.100]
I don't think so.

[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.440]
No.

[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.000]
Just because he kept asking about J. Bomis.

[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.180]
J. Bomis, it's not his name is Bomis.

[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.800]
But nevertheless.

[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.380]
Let's see.

[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.280]
SUDs sent me an email.

[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.300]
The real SUDs, a big anniversary hug.

[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.060]
Thanks, SUDs.

[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.900]
Sorry, I'm a bit late with this, but wanted to send congratulations on being in the year in South Florida for 33 years.

[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.420]
Wow.

[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.460]
Personally, I think the show sounds like it's at the 34-year level.

[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.940]
Whatever that means.

[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.740]
He's great.

[00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.800]
Yes, he is.

[00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.520]
Thanks, SUDs.

[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.260]
There you go.

[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.700]
Give me a big kiss on the mustache.

[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.740]
Did he sort out the mustache?

[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.700]
He just wouldn't be SUDs without the mustache.

[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.240]
It's almost invisible now.

[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.820]
It's at a very subtle touch.

[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.320]
Really?

[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.620]

[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.640]
But it's still there.

[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.480]
What do you mean it's very subtle?

[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.820]
Well, he keeps it very close and it's very small now.

[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.900]
Close to the vest?

[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.760]
That's right.

[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.960]
I didn't know he had no alley-felching worth a vest.

[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.140]
Hey, alley!

[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.780]
You ferry!

[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.100]
The fake Paul Castanovas says, can't wait for the numbers.

[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.520]
Hope you devote the whole show to it.

[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.300]
We're on pins and needles.

[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.940]
The suits I've worried about, Bob and not us.

[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.500]
And George assures me this is not the real poly.

[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.980]
Right.

[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.900]
Well, they're on the year doing a show right now.

[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.720]
So I'm sure he wouldn't take time out from his busy schedule to be emailing this old queen.

[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.280]
That's correct.

[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.480]
Okay.

[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.680]
Bob says, here's an I.C. email.

[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.680]
Last night, my wife and I celebrated our anniversary at High Life Cafe.

[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.860]
I'm writing because the certificate was expired,

[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.620]
but they still let me use it without any hassle.

[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.000]
Right.

[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.280]
The food and service were great.

[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.500]
We will definitely go back.

[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.440]
Thanks, Neil says, Bob.

[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.260]
Thank you, Bob.

[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.500]
Great experience at a needle deal.

[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.580]
We don't have a restaurant today, but we still do have some certificates left from the last two weeks,

[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.120]
because nobody's got any money and everybody's out of work.

[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.740]
Kex South, the Kindle.

[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.440]
We got seven left for those that.

[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.500]
And E City Grill.

[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.560]
We've got 11 left for that.

[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.960]
So go to qm.com, wqm.com, and get on here and hop up those last remaining few.

[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.180]
So you want to hear what Brandon has to say or not?

[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.520]
I do.

[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.280]
I do.

[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.700]
Well, I just got through reading it.

[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.380]
See, not too much was going on.

[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.160]
I was looking for something entertaining on the internet.

[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.680]
I came across two very, very interesting audio clips.

[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.860]
Not just very interesting, or not just regular interesting, but very, very interesting.

[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.520]
One of which is who's going to bring in the numbers in flea?

[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.680]
Yeah, eventually he's got to get them emailed to him from Power 96.

[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.120]
I guess they have the email.

[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.200]
And then he'll be printing them and running them right.

[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.560]
Oh, Jesus.

[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.020]
What kind of a stale.

[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.200]
Yeah, bitch.

[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.140]
It's about you about it.

[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.440]
Why don't you?

[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.860]
One of which are the clips from about 93 when you were talking to Randy.

[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.980]
Wow.

[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.440]
Who was in studio about how much you both just liked Bob Lanciter.

[00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.780]
You were ripping him a new one.

[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.360]
And then the next one is from 1995 when Bob got a call from a listener and set him off when he found out you were in a hospital.

[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.520]
Bob went off yelling and screaming that he hates the listeners and ever going to the WSU end because it cost him his friendship with you.

[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.960]
He was worried sick about you even though you hadn't spoken him in two years at that point.

[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.400]
Then he found out all you had was just the flu and Phil Henry had a bit saying you were in a hospital.

[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.420]
And they told the story and how you discovered him and made his career.

[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.400]
It's very interesting.

[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.520]
A pair of clips especially when Bob went off on that caller.

[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.220]
I might send that snippet to you because you might even be able to play it on your cause it's just a couple of minutes long.

[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.760]
Send it to George, not to me, Brandon, because I can't play anything.

[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.320]
Right.

[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.660]
My computer ain't hooked up to the board.

[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.200]
So send it to Jorge and maybe we'll play it or maybe not.

[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.140]
We'll see.

[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.040]
I'll let you decide.

[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.500]
All right.

[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.260]
Hmm.

[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.580]
Flun?

[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.520]
Hmm.

[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.280]
Chewy.

[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.260]
Some good juicy chewy.

[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.020]
Not chewy.

[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.540]
I like chewy.

[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.960]
Yeah.

[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.880]
Got some chunks in there.

[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.500]
No.

[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.820]
I wish I did.

[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.320]
I like that.

[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.020]
It's a good appetizer.

[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.300]
Sean was obviously a crazy person.

[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.980]
And you know, I get accused.

[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.640]
Oh, you all call people idiots in that.

[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.860]
Well, listen, when I read this, just the first sentence will convince you that this Sean, this is not our pole guy.

[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:15.180]
Sean, this is another Sean was wondering if your new staff could find the hospital Robin Williams is staying at.

[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.060]
If your new staff could find a.

[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.020]
My girlfriend wants to go over and annoy him with some of that patch Adam stick while his ticker is being repaired.

[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:35.860]
Yeah.

[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.960]
See if the new staff can find what hospital Robin Williams is in as it will get them right on it.

[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.220]
Yeah.

[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.960]
Also, you hear Bob's barbs, the barbs bush had some hard issues yesterday too.

[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.740]
I think the news here is they even found a heart and that old skank.

[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.000]
With all this heart business in the media, glad to hear you've begun nesting.

[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:58.040]
Is having Paco around your equivalent old lady, latching onto cats to suffice that nurturing maternal instinct?

[00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.080]
Yeah, I guess so.

[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.140]
They do say it's good for the car.

[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.120]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.520]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:07.920]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.000]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.200]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.840]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.400]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:16.920]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.000]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.620]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.600]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.060]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.060]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.600]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.420]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.260]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:25.560]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.960]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.800]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.120]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.040]
Betty who unfortunately is not joking.

[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.160]
Remember I said yesterday Betty had an arbitrage diary?

[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:36.680]
See.

[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.360]
I gave her instructions as to what to do,

[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.360]
but she says, okay, but if I feel in just what I listen to

[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.860]
leaving out all the terminal crap hola,

[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.100]
my book is going to look pretty sparse when I send it in

[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.160]
with one program daytime, 10 to 2 on QAM,

[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.680]
and what evening program by a podcast,

[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.040]
Night of Midnight on Satellite.

[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.900]
Well, it's not a contest to see if you're diary-heavy,

[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.480]
sparse, or not sparse, or real busy, Betty.

[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.400]
It's a question of what you do listen to.

[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.680]
So please, please fill it in for us and for whatever else you

[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.100]
listen to and send it on in.

[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.180]
Please, Betty.

[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.440]
Quit trying to take something very, very simple

[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.160]
and making it very, very complicated,

[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.400]
kind of like our management does.

[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.100]
Here's the poll from yesterday.

[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.160]
I switched it.

[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.640]
Pretty interesting result.

[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.460]
7002 votes.

[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.280]
If I was stuck on a deserted island,

[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.260]
the one thing I would want to have is a woman,

[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.380]
315, a five-gallon jugger-fresh water, 109,

[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.760]
a pocket knife, 75, a book of matches, 47,

[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.580]
a bottle of rum, 35, Joey Jonas, 32.

[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.100]
Oh, my God.

[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:35.520]
Yeah.

[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.300]
A radio, 30, a mirror, 15, the Bible, 14,

[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.540]
my iPod 11, the portable DVD player in a movie,

[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.220]
Castaway, 6, I have a blanket, five,

[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.040]
a bag of Doritos, four, a bag.

[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.880]
It have to probably be a big bag, I would imagine.

[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:50.460]
Right.

[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.180]
And a flashlight, four, a bag of Doritos.

[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.620]
We have a big old bag, kind of like the family size bag,

[00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.600]
but Al Goldstein used to eat the cereal, remember that?

[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.220]
Mm-hmm.

[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.600]
From extra?

[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.540]
It was extra, extra, extra large.

[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:04.760]
Oh, yeah.

[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.960]
The family size.

[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.760]
He's either right out of the box, Al Goldstein.

[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.040]
And he ballooned up to about a thousand pounds,

[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.020]
and then he fell on hard times, and I was down to about 30 pounds.

[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:13.580]
Right.

[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.140]
That's what I would say, Al Green.

[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:15.520]
The poverty diet.

[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.660]
We're selling food.

[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:17.420]
What?

[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.680]
The poverty diet.

[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.340]
Works every time.

[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.120]
Yeah, the poverty diet.

[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.100]
I'm a fast Jew.

[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:21.800]
Mm-hmm.

[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.520]
Not anymore.

[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.560]
In fact, if you look on that blog, everybody's got a blog.

[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.000]
Norma can't's got a blog.

[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.080]
Oh, boy.

[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.160]
That issue we were discussing with Flea about the ratings and bonuses and stuff.

[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.520]
That's an interesting point.

[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.080]
And of course, there's only one way we're going to get an answer to that,

[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.580]
and that is if that of Norma can't were involved in any way,

[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.220]
shape or form with Jolly Jobelle or Me or the show,

[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.740]
we might get an answer, but he's not.

[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.520]
He's busy blogging and logging and flogging and whatever.

[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:47.360]
He's an idiot.

[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.420]
Oh, there he goes again, calling his own agent an idiot.

[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.380]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.600]
Anthony and Tamerex is happy 33rd.

[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.960]
I thought you might find this humorous.

[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.040]
I work for it.

[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:57.980]
Where's the numbers already?

[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:58.900]
It's 10 after 10.

[00:10:59.100 --> 00:10:59.500]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.520]
I work for a pain clinic sitting in their former location's parking lot,

[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.300]
directing customers to the new location.

[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.760]
I've been to this location for three days.

[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.520]
Found out yesterday.

[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.880]
The building next door is the Religious Radio Station 1520 Wexi.

[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.440]
I'll ride.

[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.200]
I was made aware of this information by a pastor who works there as a talk show host.

[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.460]
When he told me they did talk radio, I told him I listened to you every day,

[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.700]
asked him if he has heard of you.

[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.840]
When he responded with a sarcastic smile on his face,

[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.920]
yes, I'm aware of Mr. Neal Rogers.

[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.540]
Ha-ha, this is Anthony.

[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.300]
Ha-ha.

[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.560]
Also last week, you were discussing old-time candies.

[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.400]
Remember, chico sticks?

[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:31.740]
No.

[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:32.760]
They were great.

[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.720]
Hope you enjoy it.

[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.380]
Have a great weekend.

[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.860]
What do you do to Anthony and Tamerex?

[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.940]
I never heard of chico sticks.

[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:37.440]
Did you?

[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.100]
Yes.

[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.080]
What are they?

[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.640]
They're kind of like a butter finger sort of a thing.

[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.300]
Really?

[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:42.660]
Yes.

[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.220]
I like butter finger.

[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:45.740]
Just fine.

[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:48.660]
That's fine.

[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.280]
Yeah.

[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.600]
You like butter finger?

[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.580]
I love them a lot.

[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.160]
I just had one of them a day ago.

[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:53.380]

[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:53.380]

[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.000]
You had one a few days ago?

[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:55.460]
Yeah.

[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.420]
Like three days ago, I forget.

[00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.740]
Wish I could find me a Clark bar.

[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.640]
Well, I haven't had one of those.

[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.000]
I don't know how many years.

[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.640]
Many, many, many, many, many years.

[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.300]
I'm sure you have those.

[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:06.420]

[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.020]
I'm going to ask you to email you a picture of the chico sticks.

[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:09.860]
I'm sure you've seen them.

[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.440]
Oh, I don't want to see a picture of the chico.

[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.020]
Who wants to see a picture of candy?

[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:15.700]
Well, I can't.

[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.600]
I've said you the candy.

[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:17.940]
Well, why not?

[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.900]
The thousand, 115 points.

[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.380]
It's lost most of what it gained yesterday.

[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.680]
That's the bad news.

[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.600]
It's going down, down, down.

[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.960]
All you schmucks out there, you schmucks, McGiggy's.

[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.440]
I told you a long time ago, a fool in his money or soon parted.

[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.380]
I learned my lesson.

[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.200]
It's gambling without the fun.

[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.160]
That's the stock market.

[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:36.860]
It's not investing.

[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.360]
It's gambling without the fun.

[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.520]
185 votes on the new pool.

[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.820]
We'll get to it after the break.

[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.520]
And then I'm sure by then lots of big numbers are coming in.

[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.480]
You're smooth.

[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:49.940]
Deal.

[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.240]
Yeah.

[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.560]
So where's those numbers?

[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.500]
I don't know.

[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.900]
Are you cereal?

[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.300]
Where is the stone you're wearing?

[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.880]
You swam in the 400 meter individual medley.

[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.480]
The stone you wear and you race the four by 100 freestyle relay.

[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.740]
The stone you wear and you swim the 200 meter freestyle.

[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.720]
And the stone you turn the 200 meter butterfly

[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.920]
There's only one way to win the gold

[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.400]
Every swimmer must get stones

[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:32.460]
Well, the stone you win the 4x200 meter freestyle relay

[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.980]
The stone you win the 200 meter individual medley

[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.400]
The stone you win the 100 meter butterfly

[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.440]
And the stone you win the 4x100 meter medley relay

[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.520]
There's only one way to win 8 gold

[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.900]
Every swimmer must get stones

[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.560]
1017 at 560 WQAM

[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.120]
We got the big O2 mad dog 4 to 7

[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.100]
Perikun hotline 79

[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.160]
Dolphin tonight 9 to 10 wow and then DA 10 to midnight

[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.240]
Got some real clenkers in there

[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.460]
Now, so what's the story?

[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:12.980]
There is a one

[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.940]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.140]
I have no doubt that we'll get the numbers as soon as they're able to bring them

[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.600]
What kind of a horseball answer is that?

[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.820]
Well, how about if I get up and go over to power at any sex and see what's holding it up?

[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:31.460]
Yeah

[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.480]
Go talk to Eddie mixed because say, hey, yo Eddie, what's going on?

[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.040]
Even the fake time jicker writes everyone's whipped up into a frenzy about today's show

[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.960]
Tell shit to get off his stuff this instant

[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.260]
Remember those days when kids screw me?

[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:42.560]
Sure

[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.780]
Long time ago, that's because power 96 always gets the stuff first because we don't count

[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.880]
They're at fam, they're big time

[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.180]
We just make believe, we're like Conway Twitty, only make believe

[00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.160]
This is, I knew this was going to happen once you told me that flea was going to get the emails

[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.360]
I mean, come on

[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.780]
Yeah, yeah, what?

[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.120]
Nothing yet, he says

[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.600]
Nothing yet?

[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.940]
Nothing yet, he has gotten it

[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.840]
What does that mean?

[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.940]
He has gotten nothing yet, nothing is the opposite of something

[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.160]
It's 10, 18

[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.860]
Okay, I think the magic should stop doing the show until we get the numbers

[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.540]
That's a good idea, I can go take me a little nap

[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.660]
Scott and panellist parks has tuned in to watch the first game of the world baseball classic

[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.380]
4.30 in the morning and ESPN 2

[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.900]
Boy, talk about no life

[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.400]
Live from Tokyo, bootshobby and more testy's distrata

[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.960]
Draw your own conclusions, it says, whatever that means, I have no idea what that means

[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.020]
I also have no idea why anybody would watch that

[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.440]
Especially at 4.30 in the morning or any other time for that matter

[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.340]
Are you telling me the MS now that there is nothing?

[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.680]
Nope, I'm making it up, he actually brought the numbers to be 10 minutes ago

[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.240]
And there's sit right here and I'm not faxing them to you because I'm a bastard

[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.900]
But we know that

[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:07.280]
Boy, he just, he's gone from the top of the list right to the rock bottom

[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.800]
Well, I don't really believe it's his fault

[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:16.360]
Well, it seems that it must be just a coincidence lately that everything he gets his finger into smells really bad

[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.540]
You know what I mean?

[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.740]
Raccoon, yeah

[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:24.760]
I mean, he's got the old stinky finger, he's got stink finger from where I'm sitting

[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.740]
Although Gary Sarner's out, that was good news

[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.660]
Thanks for delivering the good news, Lena, give us some damn numbers

[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.960]
Everybody in the market is listening, they're on the edge of their seats

[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:36.620]
They're waiting to hear about bubble loves bunch and about Paul and old Ron and to see if they took a hit

[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:42.020]
They're waiting to see how the jerks across the street did with their big mouth and their tiny numbers

[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.580]
Oh, numbers don't count, they don't tell you, yeah

[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.760]
Only little bastards numbers count when they get a good number then it counts and when they get a bad number

[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.220]
It's a bit of beep, bit of boop, bit of boop, yeah

[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.000]
Right

[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.780]
Richard and Miami says that this is another crazy person

[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.800]
I have searched to know a veil for the sound bite about 30 man used on the New Rogers show

[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.700]
About 30 man

[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.080]
Can you send me the sound bite?

[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.060]
I promise to play it incisantly until such time that I'm fired

[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.660]
100 bucks

[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.880]
Can you send me the sound bite?

[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.440]
100 bucks

[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.600]
We get these requests every day at least by sometimes several

[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.540]
I have no lines

[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.120]
I was taking on new meaning these days

[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.620]
That is really something

[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.700]
20 after 10 and there is no number yet

[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.060]
No

[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.240]
You're just, I don't understand you, I mean not that this is the end of the world

[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.220]
But anyone you or me can do about it

[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.140]
Well, why not?

[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.120]
What?

[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.040]
You jump up and down like Rumble's Totskin and start certainly hissing

[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.280]
And I jump again

[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.380]
That's right now

[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.700]
Now you're talking

[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:51.260]
God

[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.920]
I think we should strike

[00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.280]
Strike what?

[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.300]
Strike this

[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.620]
Strike a match

[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:07.560]
The match on the desert island that was right above, that was right above Joey Jonas's

[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:07.880]
A racco-

[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.800]
Yes, a match

[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.120]
And a bottle of rum

[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.280]
Sounds like the beginnings of a great party to me, but anyway, what's the deal now?

[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.520]
What is he telling you anything?

[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.620]
See this is what I don't understand

[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.700]
Yeah, he told me that he got nothing yet

[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.200]
And does he think there's a reason for that?

[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.860]
Is there some kind of a technical breakdown which wouldn't be the first time in this horseball place?

[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.560]
I don't know

[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.420]
I'm sure Clarence is in there because he was busy doing you and basketball, I was not really doubt that he's back

[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.160]
He was in Jojo

[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.160]
So I'm sure that we don't have our real program director now he's that term very loosely

[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.180]
We don't have Gary Sarner, Gary could do it because he's not in the house anymore

[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:49.940]
Yeah, Maddie Bell

[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.240]
Maddie Bell would be good

[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.560]
Maybe Maddie, yeah he used to also come with the numbers too, remember those days?

[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.300]
I get it, Maddie Bell

[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.060]
Powered on his six

[00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.760]
Right, that's right

[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.380]
Maybe Ray Perry can do it, he's not doing much of any of them

[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.000]
Maybe Ray could sort out those 45 sports stations that he's so fond of

[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.880]
Yeah, if we just had more stations doing sports talk, I'd bring a lot more people to sports talk radio

[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.900]
Oh, what a crazy person, Ray Perry

[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.140]
No, that's right, he's not the crazy person there, the ones that have them on the payroll

[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.740]
So here it's 1022, I'm, I got some stuff in my pile here, not a whole lot, but

[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.860]
Jesus, I mean everybody in the world is counting on us today and we're letting it down

[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.580]
I guess they'll stay tuned in

[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.840]
November, December and January, this is the trend, three, the rolling trend

[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.220]
Right

[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:46.520]
Now we're dropping off a bad October, so we might do okay, but then again we, who knows, I have no idea

[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.420]
Okay, I haven't got any idea, of course I've been reading all these emails all that time

[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.900]
And George thinks that they suck bad and that they're just terminal, terminal boring

[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.440]
I can't keep up space

[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.340]
So we probably won't do all so well because of the old man

[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:07.580]
That was down 155, so we gained 150, yes, to you gain, not me, and now we've lost 0,4 and a half point

[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.600]
Barbara Bush's heart surgery, she's recovering, she's still alive

[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.020]
That's the bad news

[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.500]
She still got those Marty Feldman eyes

[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:26.440]
You know, a lot of things I have a hard time believing, but this one today, this is a new low

[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.220]
23 minutes into the hour, we still haven't got anything

[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:30.700]
Right

[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:42.080]
I mean wouldn't you think that he'd have some kind of an excuse like the numbers aren't coming down

[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:47.920]
Because there's a technical glitch or some of the durable died something, something

[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.960]
I don't know if he is in touch with Eddie Mix over there, who is the recipient

[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.540]
Eddie Mix, Eddie Mix, we're kind of a phony name is that, is he akin to Tom Mix?

[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.080]
I'm gonna show his name, you know how people in the air know how I hate that name

[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.500]
Yeah, because their real name is really embarrassing

[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:03.700]
Deal, goodnight

[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:09.880]
So he's the one receiving the numbers if and when they come in and then he's gonna email them to Lee

[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.300]
And Lee's going to print them up

[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.200]
And give them to us

[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.300]
Todd says my favorite was Jonathan Witter's glad garbage man, but dates me severely

[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.260]
I know he didn't drop the poll today

[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.480]
At some point you should have a poll on the commercial spokesman you hate the most because you know it's all about the hate here in the magic city

[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.260]
My vote would be for the Burger King with a big plastic hand because he gives me the heebie jibis

[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.460]
Hope your numbers are good so you can keep your job

[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.360]
Ha ha ha

[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.200]
Okay, oh Mr. Radio says the chat rooms are going nuts

[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:46.240]
Get out of here seems like everyone in the markets excited about today's show where are the numbers you think sit will have a 1.0 I don't know

[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.240]
I'm afraid Joe won't do much better

[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:55.240]
Let's see how mad dog did against LeVastard sports radio might have run its course. I told you that a long time ago

[00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:01.040]
W.I.D. will probably have a big number with all the ditto heads whipped up into a frenzy wonder how Randy did

[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:07.200]
Yada yada yada I don't know I can't answer any of your questions because we know oh here's an attachment

[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.780]
An attachment from George Chico stick picture. I just deleted it. No, no, no

[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:19.700]
It's too late. It shows up all you got to do is scroll down. Oh, it shows up on there. Meaning okay. Oh there it is.

[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:28.520]
Now I never saw that. Wow. Those are from ancient times. I don't think I ever seen those everywhere. If I if I did I didn't like them. I hated them.

[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:41.920]
They're a butter finger variant. Oh Leo from point and you have a hectic. Yeah, load out your ass Leo. You're an absolute moron.

[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:49.820]
Have nothing to listen to. I bet you rock solid he writes. Steve Sloan. Here's the stuff for the race tomorrow at

[00:22:49.820 --> 00:23:02.700]
them. And what you call it. Here's one from me. Another chronic chronic malcontent. If you maybe change the show up just a little had a guest on every once in a while

[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:09.140]
like maybe a Republican who can debate with you imagine the ratings then you could buy Georgia car. Yes, screw you. R R R. Yeah, how do Republican on?

[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:17.800]
She lost so long. Yeah, Leo, Leo sent it twice because it was so good. 1026 and we still have nothing. Are you expect me to believe that?

[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:31.300]
Something really stinks in the in the big city. I'll tell you. You call this big market radio. Do you have to take your daughter to see the new Jonas Brothers movie?

[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:38.520]
Oh, I got to do Jonas Brothers. You need the Jonas Brothers movie survival kit. Each survival kit comes with a sleep mask so you don't have to watch

[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:46.200]
earplugs so you don't have to hear and a cyanide capsule just in case the mask and plugs don't work. Oh my God, the Jonas Brothers.

[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:56.300]
The Jonas Brothers movie survival kit. You can make it. The film is only 76 minutes long. I got to do Jonas Brothers. You made those earplugs. Oh my God, the Jonas Brothers.

[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:05.620]
The Jonas Brothers 3D concert experience survival kit. It's too late for me. Save yourselves. Okay.

[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:17.700]
Okay, so what's the story? Now, Leo and Joe Bell are trying to get the numbers. One way or another to me, emailing, printing something or other.

[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:24.600]
They're going to get them to me as fast as they can. Joe Bell actually came in here and said what?

[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:32.000]
You don't have the numbers yet. Let me go see what I can do and then he ran out. That was during the break.

[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:42.260]
1032. All of America is tuned in. At least all the people working as business and so forth are close to this business like us.

[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:54.580]
It's a conspiracy. What a joke. You know something as soon as you told me that business about all will somebody's going to email the numbers to Lee and then as soon as you told me that what you told me that was the

[00:24:54.580 --> 00:25:06.200]
thing that I was going to do. I said, uh oh, uh oh. Yeah. And I was right. Uh oh. 216 votes on our pool.

[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:13.740]
So this is embarrassing. It's humiliating. It's typical Q. A. M. and this is typically the way this operation goes.

[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:22.440]
Half fast, not slow, not fast, just half fast. How many years? How many hundred years have we been doing the ratings reports on this show?

[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:33.260]
100 hundred years. And yeah, there have been glitches in the past and that I would be once in a while to be something with a technical glitch or whatever printer or whatever it was.

[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:41.200]
But like this a half hour later and we have nothing and jolly jobell is pulling up his brown fat pants and running around like.

[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.500]
I can't believe it. Believe it. Here's the spot. I mean the pool.

[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:57.840]
Who's I'm confused. I just I can't believe this. I just can't get over it. Well, who's your all time favorite commercial character?

[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:07.500]
The where's the beef lady 56? What was her name? She's dead. Uh at bar or sell bar or something like that.

[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:17.220]
Edna Selma. I don't know. That's a lot of time I knew her name, but somebody will know 56 for her. But why is your lizard's 35 Joe Rose 28?

[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:30.560]
The caveman 26 the gecko 17 Mr. Whipple don't squeeze the charm in 15. He's also dead Tony the tiger 13 light beer guy. Yes, I am 12 light beer guy.

[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:39.260]
Clara Peller. Yes, I am. That's it. Clara Peller. Very good. She was the where's the beef lady marble man 10 Ronald McDonald three Kebler,

[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:51.460]
one and the glad garbage man. None. That's because that's 100 years old. So basically what you tell me is we've got people running around all over the place.

[00:26:51.460 --> 00:27:13.040]
Yeah. And no numbers at no numbers. The Joe also say be sure wishing you a happy 33rd anniversary. No, he's oblivious oblivious Newton John.

[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:38.920]
That's our GM man. He's running around pulling up his brown fat pants. And you just don't you seem so disinterested. I'm not disinterested. You said it sounded me like you've just given up. I said we should go on strike. But you're right. Good idea. I don't know what you suggest that either one of us do or are able to do. I'm just going a little bit. Oh, excellent. Here. Make a lot of noise.

[00:27:41.080 --> 00:28:08.900]
Clara Peller. Thank you. Scott. We already got it. Thank you. Pop bud. Go away. Pop. You're boring me. All those a holes after this and after that. I'm going to block him. He's boring. Kevin says why you so whipped up about the ratings. Neil, we all know that they're going to what they're going to be. You'll kick everyone's asking your time period. No, I will not. We haven't done that in a long time. The bastard will kick madness disaster afternoon. The rest of your station in the digital mantra pile of ones and all.

[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:38.880]
O's and of course no speaking English will rule supreme otherwise. There are the ratings. Now you can move on with the rest of the show. By the way, I was rolling on the floor yesterday hearing the course in the bonnets bit. It been years since I heard that love you. Neil and George keep up the great show. Kevin. Keep up the great show with a little bit of a stuch in there too. You know, something I'm whipped up about it. It's that this is something that we do that's that's the deal. This is a part of the show. This is something people listen for. This is something has been going on since before Jesus was an infant. And we just can't get it.

[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:48.620]
You're done. You know, I don't know why you're surprised at 1036. Considering that outpouring of affection on your anniversary from the management of this radio.

[00:28:48.760 --> 00:29:08.160]
So screw them, run around and get you the stuff you want. Screw them. Totally, positively, thoroughly incompetent. I'm sure they're back there going. I we're going to show that that bag it. We're going to make them wine all four hours. Hey, listen, we can make a whole show out of it all four hours. Where's the numbers? Sure. We can keep playing this.

[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:24.500]
I don't think I'm out of 11. How about if we just replay the 10 o'clock hour over the four times. That sounds like a great idea. I'm all for that. Well, that was down one 25. What? We'll just go to lunch.

[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.920]
Here's one from Anita. Oh, the fake Anita Bryant.

[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:42.840]
Anita, I'm actually looking forward to hearing your numbers. Unfortunately, that week that George was on the air, mustn't put a big dead into your ratings. You know because he sucks. Nobody wants to hear about how he hates his wife. All this just goes on.

[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:55.720]
This is what he wrote like last week. Oh, and wait to hear this. As for your poll, you should add Steve Cain is on air commercials. Is some of the best ever heard. Oh, yes. So we know where this is coming from. All of them.

[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.760]
Here's Jimmy Cifalus says who you guys kidding guys got killed again. They're hiding the numbers from you. We're kicking butt. Yeah, go. That's your area of expertise.

[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:13.100]
Back to Jimmy is but that's what I hear. That's what they boys in the locker room tell.

[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:27.200]
But in fact, if you to ask over at IOD, what Jimmy Cifalus's main interest is, they would tell you that's right. But nevertheless, we're still waiting.

[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:35.720]
I'm still palpitating and we're still waiting and they're running around. Oh, what are we going to do? What is it that they're doing? See, this is what I don't understand.

[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:49.840]
This isn't rocket science. They can you crazy? That's last year. Yeah. Yeah. Where's flea? I don't know over there.

[00:30:51.740 --> 00:31:00.080]
No, you need to get somebody to give us like a verbal. I believe in the morning show meeting. There's a morning show meeting in front of me. Morning show meeting. My ass.

[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:17.460]
Morning show meeting. Are they trying to figure out how come Jack Martin got disconnected this morning? No, I'm trying. I'm sure they're trying to figure out how to make it sports here and how to get more writers on there. And I say, hey, the Alex Marvez. They trying to figure out if Ethan Skolling still has those.

[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:30.280]
This is not how you have how to get the numbers lower. Oh, if anybody can do it. I know. These are the guys. I don't tell me that construction started at the end of the show yesterday. And don't tell me they're starting the hammer and they are really.

[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:46.000]
So we got two good reasons for me to bail out of here today. There's thumping. Can you hear it? The hammering? Yeah. Can you really? No. Oh, I can. Very disconcerting. Mui, Malu, etc.

[00:31:48.180 --> 00:32:05.320]
Well, here are the numbers we got so far. Oh, oh, oh, and even. Oh, that's it. All we got. Oh, no. You're listening to Neil Rogers. Well, here we go again. I'm so sorry to tell you later. Floridians dumb as dirt. Absolutely.

[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:16.560]
The stimulus package. Oh, Thomas says we need. There's nothing more than fork and more political green.

[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:34.500]
Saving banks that sank from their bad policy. There's more than 50 ways to waste our money. Oh, more than 50 ways to waste our money. Here's billions for sex. 50 million is the fun.

[00:32:34.500 --> 00:33:04.480]
The art, the gastro-queen technology. Sounds focused to me. One billion for census. Don't make sense to us. You let's philosophy. Yes. Man, you're kidding me. Yeah, you've got to be effing kidding me. 1044 and we still have no numbers. Right. I got a text from leader in the break though. And he said what? He doesn't have access to the site. He wishes that he could do more. He can't give us anything unless somebody gives him.

[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:20.340]
Something and so. And why aren't they giving him anything? I don't know. Why ain't they giving him nothing? I don't know. Maybe because they know he's going to give him to us. I don't know.

[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:45.140]
Maybe they were really, really bad. Maybe. I mean so bad. It's possible. Sure. I mean, why doesn't he go over there and see what the hell they're doing over there? I thought you were told we were told that they're in a meeting. Who's in a meeting?

[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:55.700]
Whenever they have a meeting, it's everybody. You know the meetings that they like to have here. I thought you said jolly joe bell came running in there and said he was going to find everybody not him.

[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:03.800]
What do you mean like real people? The programming staff, the morning show people, the promotions, people, some sales people. I assume I don't know who's involved in those morning show meetings, but Lee is.

[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:17.460]
Oh, wait a minute. He's in a meeting while he's supposed to be getting us the numbers. He'll be on his phone. It shows up on his phone. Oh my God. Are you shmitting me? You're right. We should go on strike.

[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:31.660]
I have this sick feeling in a pit of my stomach. Sick. You know what I mean? Yeah. We could just spin some wax. That sounds like a great idea. It's like a capital idea.

[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:40.320]
Or I got a bit that I could play over and over again. Do you have to take your daughter to see the new Jonas Brothers movie? Yeah, we could play that a hundred times. There we go.

[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:51.780]
Oh, it's the team from Mondo Connay. It's more. It used to be my theme song. I'm going to just snooze a few years ago. K-Winding.

[00:34:52.380 --> 00:35:02.180]
I'm going to play more. I'm going to play more. Yeah, let's play more of more. More in Mindy. That was not one thirty one and a half.

[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:09.640]
I wish I had some heart about it. No, this is great. This is perfect. This used to be my theme. I bet there's like three people remember this.

[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:15.940]
Maybe Alice Rantos remember. So I don't know. 7.46 in the morning. I don't think Alice is up. Who knows?

[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:20.640]
The download.

[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:31.460]
The channel. W.Y. and Z. Am has been widely playing a clip. Access course. But in the meantime, the station began airing Rachel Maddo's air America media show in the morning.

[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:42.520]
5.9 a.m. starting Monday. W.Y. and Z picked up. I'm as last September with Nicole Sandler when the close end. I said who cares? Well, that's from Barry Jackass. We'll have a imaginary.

[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:52.080]
Oh, here's Barry Jackass. Also says I'm hearing from my sources at the ticket that Howard Davis and Steve Wife are locked in Howard's office listening to your show. They say the mood is quite tense.

[00:35:52.280 --> 00:36:07.300]
Yeah, like they wouldn't have the numbers. They need to be listening to my show. Take Barry. That's really weak. That's really lame. I guarantee you they got the numbers. We sure is held on. Josh Darryl texted me and said I am on my way. Sorry about this morning. 10 minutes away.

[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:37.280]
He's 10 minutes away. I've a. Now we can get this straightened out. Clarins is coming in. We you know, when you leave in the hands of a minor league, like flea, that's the problem. I mean, flea, you know, he's done a lot of nice things for us and you know, he's just not up to. He's just not up to it. This is this small potatoes. What? The small potatoes maybe is what it is. Small potatoes is right. So does it take her? Once he comes in there, then there's a lot of things.

[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:54.580]
I'm going to all scatter like Oh, geez, the big boss is here. The big cheese. The head cheese. Uh huh. Right. Like Bob Vermouth. I remember in Amsterdam, I came into my apartment one day and there was a note from my cheap ass landlord. Oh, the big boss arrives tonight at eight o'clock about the big boss, meaning Bob Vermouth.

[00:36:54.580 --> 00:37:22.700]
Keep. Yeah, he was serious. Bob Vermouth boy, what he didn't that studio. If you could have seen that city, if you could like try to breathe the air downstairs in my basement, remember I was choking and gagging and coughing and puking from all the construction they had done now, including putting up that my second satellite dish. That was the most important thing at that satellite dish going to get all those European music videos.

[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:36.920]
That's what I was doing there. Well, I was doing a lot more than that, too, as a matter of fact, but those were back in the days, you know, when I cared about doing such things, I no longer care. All I care about is the numbers and where the hell are they?

[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:47.100]
Clarence is frantically. He's flooring it right now, frantically zooming into the studio into the building, into the parking lot.

[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:53.760]
See here, here's a classic example, jolly joe, how long ago was that about a half hour ago? jolly joe came in there. Oh,

[00:37:53.800 --> 00:38:03.780]
G. You know, I told you that. Well, now what has he got for us so far, but so is but so are but so are. So that's what Jimmy Cifil is specializes in but so is.

[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:10.840]
Jason says, you know why you don't have the ratings? One word flee slash tech. He is the mole to face back stabbing creep.

[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:19.040]
I'm a lighter note for the pole the noise, dominoes pizza character in the 80s, avoid the noise, okay, closing F flee says Jason.

[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:27.880]
Oh, Jason's actually like a business guy. He's got like a company and whatever. He's a marketing associate. How do you like that? All right.

[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:38.980]
Not all of our people are unemployed, bumms who you know hang out on the beach and send us crap from their cell phone. Fred and Bokas says, why don't you try sports talk?

[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:54.020]
I don't think so. We have a steady stream, including this stupid one from Fred and Boka. Why don't you try sports talk? We got enough of that crap on the station already more than enough.

[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:59.980]
And I guarantee you, I don't know what the numbers are going to be, but I think our numbers will continue being higher than any of the other segments.

[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:08.460]
And this is the only non sports stage talk. It's sure on the station. Got it Fred, you idiot. You moron. You fairy. See, there goes again calling names.

[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:22.260]
So we have to wait for clearances at it. I guess so. This could be the low point. I mean, you know, I never thought we could get lower than we have been in recent past with the jelly.

[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:32.940]
If you want something to bitch about, yes, wherever the numbers are available, whatever website, whatever system that they have, I'm certainly technically able to go and get this information for us ourselves.

[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:40.320]
But I'm going to give you the reason for some reason. I'm not entitled to that. And neither is flea.

[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:51.060]
In other words, you're not going to be access to getting the numbers. That is correct. That is correct. Or me. Clarice has got it though. Right. He has access.

[00:39:51.340 --> 00:40:01.340]
That was not one 44. Oh, geez. The dough is down. We're in a fraction. We're not to wait for anybody. They say here's the website. Here's what you need to put in. And here you go.

[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:19.240]
I'll be damned. Well, let's see. It's slow today here in the office. Oh, that's that was Brandon. It's old. I know you don't care about the streaming video. But when I logged on the QM this morning, there was a video.

[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:27.700]
A video ad from Joe Rose. He is so ugly here. Well, we got a lot of ugly people. That's why we're on the radio. Although he's on TV.

[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:38.420]
Buckethead. I wouldn't say Joe is all ugly. He just he's just a guy. You know, he's just a dumb joke. Good guy though. We like Joe a lot.

[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:48.060]
We wish he would do it a better show lately. But that's beside the point. Just a joke. 254 votes on the pool. Where the beat Clara Peller seems to be. She's the winner, I think.

[00:40:50.860 --> 00:41:03.760]
So we're waiting for clearances at what we're doing now. I mean, I'm waiting for instruction from you. You're the producer. Yeah. Yeah. I say go on. You say go on strike. Yeah. Lucky strike. LSMFT. Lucky strike means fine tobacco.

[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:16.700]
LSMFT. I don't think you can say MF anymore. They probably have to take that out of there. LST. Yeah. Lucky strike tobacco means fine.

[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:28.740]
Mo for your money. Well, here's Mike in the middle Tennessee. He says keep bitching at these as clowns. I want the F and numbers to have been in Tennessee for 10 years.

[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:34.640]
I was the best thing I ever did leaving that filthy third world country South Florida. Only thing I miss is Pomp and O Park went there during a recent trip.

[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:44.200]
Found the casino couldn't find anything resembling a horse. So I came back to Tennessee. Happy 33rd stay well, keep eating on the years as Mike. Now I got nothing to eat. I got no food in the house.

[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:53.320]
But nevertheless. I don't want to dig too deep into my pile here because I want to get these numbers out. I want to get them across to the public.

[00:41:53.320 --> 00:42:03.080]
All the people who are sitting on pins and needles. And I'm sure the people who work for a cheap channel they don't come running. Oh, here you guys. Here's all the numbers. I doubt that.

[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:12.220]
Me too. And of course if we had any real person any of the other stations listening and emailing, then we don't we already have some information, but we don't.

[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:17.940]
Am I right? Right. You bet. Needles and pins to searches.

[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:30.820]
Steps on it. Yeah, well, yeah, I'm a bastard. That's George for you. I talk it up. He steps on it. I'm a bastard in a basket. Yeah, fast in the basket.

[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:41.240]
What a bad bad movie. Bad. Yep. I'm not sure which was worse because I didn't see the other one from the very beginning. No country for old men.

[00:42:43.100 --> 00:43:03.280]
But I saw enough of it to the. I mean, what was it about? What did what didn't mean? What it? What was the point? I don't know. The fact that it was a made up story is like then what's the point of it? If it was had been a fact that we had to watch for two hours to figure out that that guy was a bastard and a hard, hard money grabbing piece of turd in there will be blood.

[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:12.720]
There will be blood. I mean, I you know, we didn't need to they could have just put that up on the screen. Oh, here's a guy. He's a bastard and he's a piece of crap.

[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.940]
And it's not really his kid. He doesn't care about him anyway and yada yada.

[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:27.140]
And there were a bunch of crooked people in the oil goodness. Isn't that a revelation? When we go to get the movie about the ragheads, that's the one I want to see.

[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:41.100]
The ragheads, the evil doing ragheads, those are the ones, those are the triggers in the sand pile. That was down 151 points. So we do 151.33, 151.01.

[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:55.440]
So we've lost a dollar from yesterday. Mr. Can you spare a dime brother? Can you spare a dime? No. Not you. I'm not talking about you. Oh, so what's happening now? I mean, nothing.

[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:06.380]
You're just sitting there in an empty room. What are you doing? I'm sitting here in an empty room watching TV watching Bill Schneider on TV. You got any suggestions? I'll be happy to, you know, I think pipe bomb sounds good.

[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:19.940]
Piping of pipe bomb and Joe Bells. That sounds really good. I didn't bring it to work with me today. What? I didn't bring it to work with me today. I'll be damned. Probably put it in somebody's mailbox. Remember those days? Oh, yeah.

[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:28.880]
Back in the 60s, I think it was. A lot of pipe bombs and dig counties stuff like that.

[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:36.340]
263 votes on the poll and nobody voted for the glad garbage bin. I don't know why you put that on their or the noise. Why not? They suggested it.

[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:43.200]
Okay, George is amenable to whatever you want to put on it. He's amenable for just me. I mean question. Don't I mean?

[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:55.860]
Question from Adrian. What does a radio stations call it as mean? Not what do, but what does WQM? Does this have specific meaning? No. Also, who gets the ratings forms?

[00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:06.920]
I only listen to AM because FM and South Florida sucks, but I don't receive any ratings forms to fill out. Do I have to sign up somewhere to receive it? Yeah, sign up at the altar at the magic altar of radio, Adrian. You idiot.

[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:22.220]
Please more insider radio talk less, George, and keep eating whenever you want. Whatever you want. After all, you only have one life to live. It might as well be with a full stomach. Excellent. Like I said, what a genius, man. My kind of dog. What?

[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:37.260]

[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:43.300]

[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.220]

[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:54.940]

Five-star voice. Remember, son. It's for nine. I'm a bad day with money.

[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:26.980]
Now, she had a heart procedure. Well, big deal. Big Simmons. We got some numbers coming over right now. Here's the first page.

[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:34.260]
See, this is extra inversing because I had all my fax paper piled up in there in my machine. I got my stapler out.

[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:40.800]
Got my usual operation. Go and let's see. This is persons 2554 midday.

[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:51.300]
Right. Well, we're not going to be this is persons November, December, January, IOD from a 4.0 to a 4.9 from tied for six to fifth.

[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:58.580]
That's midday. Well, we knew that. That would they had that big rush. They had the big rush in December.

[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.420]
That's what that's all about.

[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:14.960]
Oh, God. Who's number one in life? Well, how do you like that? They continue every trend. They're number one in persons 2554 life.

[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:20.440]
Elevator music slush. But down to a 5.5. They dropped almost a full point. They're still number one.

[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:30.480]
Hots number two. Coast number three. Oh, not tied for number two with a 5.4 share. CMQ FAM. It's a three way tie for a second with CMQ FAM midday.

[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:37.840]
Where the hell are we? We're not even on. We're nowhere. Are we even on page three?

[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.680]
We have dropped off the fake. No, actually, we went up.

[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:53.000]
We went from a tie from 19 to 18. But then again, this is persons 2.6. So that means we did a 5.0. Something's sharing men 2554.

[00:48:53.800 --> 00:49:05.820]
Not great, but it could be worse. And that's 10 to 3. You see? I see. You got it. I'm looking at these other ones. How about Waxi? Uh oh. 1.7.

[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:13.880]
They went from a 1.1 to a 1.7 midday from 23 to 22. They're making a big move. Now, you only sending me midday numbers.

[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:26.520]
You're going to send me some other crap. I set you all the men 18 plus numbers right after those, like I said. I see. Well, persons 2554. That's where it's at.

[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:33.840]
I'm talking about day parts. I'm not talking about. Yeah, no, I got the whole thing back. I said 18 plus.

[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:46.840]
Yeah, the whole day. This is exciting. And don't you like the way this thing is printed out? It's a different format. Yeah, it goes all the way back to May, June, July of 2008.

[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:59.880]
That's great for tracking. So we went up a hair in midday. That's 10 to 3. Of course, we don't know what happened in that 2 to 3 hour with a big. Oh, I think that's cool. I think that rings a bell.

[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:27.200]
Let's see what else you got. Whose last WFE radio. Faye is got a 0.3 in midday. W I N Z had a 2.9 in it and based on what? What were they doing? What do they got on now? I don't know. Still scare America.

[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:41.980]
They went from 18 to a tie for 12. That is truly scary. But then again, we're dropping the format anyway. So it's a mood point. Nice go on, cheap channel.

[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:47.020]
This one, they finally start putting in a little bit of a number. We're dropping the format. We're going sports.

[00:50:51.180 --> 00:51:01.060]
Now what's this? Many 18 plus the overall week. Radio Mambe. Oh, that's the kind of trend we had in January. No speaking English. No say obli English.

[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:28.160]
That's the trend. Radio Mambe old men 6.1 share W I O D second with a 5.4. Based on sure on rush. Rush. Not on Jimmy Syphilite. You can be sure that CMQ F AMA dropped from first to third from 6. Share to a 4.8. They had a week trend. CMQ F AMA. Radio Almour is number 4. You notice the trend here speaking of trends? No.

[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:43.980]
Right wing and no speaking English. Top 105. Number 5. What? They go ahead and hand. Don't they? Now let's see. This is for the entire week. Many 18 plus men. Men. I'm looking for the sports stations Q AM tied for 15th. We dropped a little bit 2.5.

[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:57.860]
I and Z they went up to a 2.3. Waxi a 2.2. They went from a 1.8 to a 2.2. We still beat him just barely to 5 to a 2.2. They both sucked. Those are horrible numbers. We're tied for 15th. They're 20th.

[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:10.980]
What about FTL the light bulb junior 0.0.6. Let me say it again. 0.6. Wow. Just like Ray Perry said if we just had a bunch more sports stations they'd really kick his ass.

[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:23.760]
They would kick his big smelly ass. That a boy Ray you're on top of it man. You know your crap. If I last time I was there's little bird told me crap is raised middle name.

[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:35.600]
Oh here's the day parts many teams plus let's see how Jimmy Cifalus did in the morning. Oh look at that. Went up a full point nice going Jimmy. Hey Jimmy you fairy. Radio.

[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:45.040]
Radio on B number one with a 6.7 share QBA number two QBA. Radio on more number three boy there does anybody speaking.

[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:56.560]

[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:15.600]
Did I write it down? Yeah we told us because I sure saw. HDR is at it. That sounds right. I mean they've changed the call. They butchered.

[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:22.080]
So many stations expect people to do it from a 2.0 to a 1.7. They went down with Bubba. Down down down got to go down and not up.

[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:30.380]
So run and Paul went up from a 4.5 in a book to a 5.1. Their number four they went from fifth to fourth.

[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:40.780]
And the station that Bubba's on went down. Boy that a boy doesn't need you guys at the best you are geniuses.

[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:46.380]
I OD from a 3.9 in the book to a 4.9 in the trend on the strength of Jimmy syphilis.

[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:59.540]
That a boy Jimmy you're real a real card carrying Nazi all the Nazis chimed right in. How did we do in the morning many team plus two six down to a 2.5 from time for 11 to time for 12.

[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:28.140]
I'm not sure if you know what I'm saying. I'm not sure if you know what I'm saying.

[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:46.300]
I'm not sure if you know what I'm saying. I'm not sure if you know what I'm saying.

[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:53.960]
I'm still trying to figure out what they've got on here do we know are they still doing scare America or what's I guess so somebody will call it to tell us.

[00:54:54.040 --> 00:55:05.020]
Yes somebody will clue us in mid days look at rush 8.1 number one what did I tell you the whole thing is built on rush CMQ FAM a number two of the 7.3.

[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:13.300]
This is many team plus we went from a 2.9 up to a 3.2 in men pretty weak tied from 9th to tied for 8th.

[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:20.140]
But then again it's 10 to 3. Right and it's many team plus right.

[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:24.180]
I and Z went from a 2.7 to a 3.2 tied with us.

[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:29.640]
Scare America they're dropping it they're dropping it like a hot tamale.

[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:37.240]
Now I'm looking for a low the light bulb I didn't give you depots number anymore. Did I know.

Oh waxy oh waxy if we found them yet we got into the whatever page they might be on.

In many team plus they're not on the first page they're not on the second page they are at the top of the third page they went from a 1.7 to a 2.2 tied for 17th.

[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:18.720]
Oh they're going to be crowing about that. Now what did sit have again what was that number in the morning on the wax.

[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:25.000]
1.7 or something you said. Let me take a look at it again it was pretty lame pretty lame for a guy with a big mouth.

[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:39.100]
Yeah 1.7 tied for 20th I mean Joe Rose had a 2.5 they had a 1.7 no contest I mean both numbers suck but nevertheless I'm not very nothing to write home about either but then again least we're on the first page.

[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:44.540]
Right. Yeah we'll take the bottom of it but we're least we're on it.

[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:51.720]
That's the biggest number we've had since June July and August since George was doing those great summer shows.

[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:57.860]
That's what we need a lot more George here's George right now as a matter of fact to start goose nubbers up.

[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:04.100]
Oh me oh me oh god.

[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:17.800]
Oh a ride shot up some steroids so he could hit home runs.

[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:25.180]
He only took them just to help him back it's not like the guy was all hot down on cracks.

[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:33.800]
So don't hurt only rods chances to be in the hall of fame because there's a there.

[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:38.920]
Drugs who play in the old ball game.

[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:46.980]
Okay 1118 a QA let's take a look at the afternoon number boy we got a walloped in the afternoons in the afternoon.

Waxi number four from 11 to fourth lab bastard with a 4.4 share.

[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:27.380]

[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:33.620]
I. N. Z. number seven with all they got in the afternoon some obscure America crap.

Where the hell is where are we are we on the first page. No we're in the second page. No.

[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:48.240]
We're on the third page. Yes. From a 2 3 in the book down to a 2 1 from tied for 16 to 18.

[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:56.180]
Three to 7 p.m. I'll tell you those 2 to 4 hours are really rock solid.

[00:58:56.280 --> 00:59:01.480]
I bet that could be wrong about that but I don't think so.

[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.900]
And then you want to see nights. I mean does anybody care about 7.9?

[00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:10.400]
Yeah. Most of the number start with Waxi radio mambe.

[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:13.420]
No speaking English number one with an 8.8 share.

[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:16.340]
Your highest number in a long time maybe ever.

[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:23.760]
W. E. D. R number two 6.3 hot 105 number 3 6.0 CMQ F. A. M. A.

[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:27.260]

I. O. D. 3. 9 at night.

[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.300]
What do they got the heat?

[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:35.760]
They got the heat really switched to eat to 9.40.

[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:37.040]
I don't know and I really don't care.

[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:41.760]
I. N. Z. They did good. Skier America. That's why they're dropping it.

[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:45.320]
They went from 20th to tied for 11th with a 2.9 at night. Where the hell are we?

[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:51.900]
Where's Waxi and Q. A. M. at night? Well, Waxi don't have the marlins no more because this is November December January.

[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:54.600]
So they drop off the faith. Although they beat us.

[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:59.000]
They had a 1.3. We had a 1.1. Let's hear it for our DA.

[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:03.780]
Finally cracking those ones. No more of those zero numbers.

[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.420]
Right? And that good? Right? Yes. Good.

[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:10.480]
They're a 21st. We're tied for 22nd. So we're right on their ass at night.

[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.020]
We're right. Breathe them right down their back.

[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.320]
And that's before I think they cut loose Kenny Rogers.

[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.440]
Oh man. And here's a real shot.

[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.840]
This must be from John Z. T. R. or some other.

[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.960]
Or maybe this is a response from across the street.

[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:35.000]
Golden boy writes subject whiner. I always laugh when I hear you constantly making excuses for your plummeting ratings and popularity.

[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:41.440]
But then if you always hear that you must be always listening to you see they always start out right off the bat by saying I hear you do this.

[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.740]
I hear you say that which means they listen religiously every minute of every day that my voice is on the air.

[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:47.660]
Is not correct? Yes.

[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:52.420]
You blame the declining popularity of radio in general in particular the AM band. That is correct.

[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:57.100]
It rush limbaugh is reaching new heights and earnings ratings and fame making international news headlines daily.

[01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.600]
Well that's because there's a lot of Nazis out there who get the diaries.

[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:04.820]
You blame your age saying you don't you're too old to do a good show anymore now when did I say that?

[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:11.760]
I'm too old to do a good show. Oh you expect accuracy to made up evil yet Michael Savage aged 67 this month is skyrocketed in real.

[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.720]
This is a real Nazi hugger. Uh huh.

[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.780]
Skyrocketed in recent years to become the third most listen to a host in the country with a stream of consciousness radio.

[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:25.520]
You blame your agent for not getting you syndicated yet the sales people on your own home station are always in trouble with you constantly pissing off the advertisers.

[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:36.700]
And somebody corolla who was recently taken off there still recently got a million podcast downloads that I actually even being on the air somebody corolla who's that.

[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.660]
Dota. Oh you blame the restrictions placed upon you by the FCC and beesleys council.

[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.220]
This is the most laughable of all.

[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:51.200]
It's as if you're admitting your success is dependent on your ability to play fart sounds and at once you've been stripped of these crude instruments you're left bare without the teller skilled to do it.

[01:01:51.260 --> 01:02:00.400]
East and show on your own is if all your previous success was only your ability to press the fart button and you have no ability to adapt that's right the fart sounds what made this show what it was.

[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.040]
The truth it now here comes the best.

[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:10.180]
And this is from somebody who listens every minute of every day is listening now as I speak golden boy taken notes.

[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:23.480]
The truth is that you've been a cancer this off the word or four years feeding off of its weaknesses and problems for years you made your living by stirring up hatred and hostility in and of the area and profit greatly by doing so now.

[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:35.020]
South Florida's not only overcome the infection that is near Rogers but it's thriving and your act is no longer relevant those who did fall for your stick picked up and left like yourself they may be listening online but certainly not filling out any diaries for you.

[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:42.360]
The majority of those who remain realize how out of touch and irrelevant your rational manic hatred for this area is and are no longer titillated by your ranting.

[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:52.600]
Great good one took a lot of time and a lot effort to write all that swill I'm too old to do a good show I know I say that all the time right all the time to old.

[01:02:54.380 --> 01:03:03.480]
And rush rush is just more popular than ever which is a really great sign of the times about the rating Steve writes I've

[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:12.960]
been this is just luck but missing pouring now that the ones like golden boys email are much more exciting much more interesting much more captivating.

[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:18.160]
You are a cancer you fed off a South Florida for years you can't say I had a had a had a had a.

[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:31.320]
He forgot to mention the fact that nobody can hear a signal to that that's a little bit of a problem since this isn't the only show on this radio station that's ratings deficient of late you make it excuse is a good yes I'm too old to do

[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:34.020]
anything else and I can't play those damn far sounds.

[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:40.900]
Paul Castronovas is we're number four damn what we got a five one Bubba's got a one seven tell Disney there are enough Tampa red next in South Florida.

[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:45.820]
Now you keep telling me this is not from the real Paul Castronovo correct well.

[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:58.860]
They they spanked Bubba's ass Bubba who talk he's another one it talks with a big mouth talks a big game and he's going to do this he's going to bet and you know he's a he's like Ron and Ron he's a

[01:03:58.860 --> 01:03:59.600]
Tampa act.

[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:08.760]
Red next out of love from when I'm told I've never heard him always says nice things about you well that's great.

[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:14.740]
So what do you think they're thinking across the street besides writing me that email I just read that's it.

[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:27.260]
Is that it? It's like I told you this morning before the show the only people who care about either other station or the people inside each station I see they're obsessed with us were obsessed with them and by we I mean that other people

[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:34.180]
work here not you and me I could give a crap less about them right by the way daylight savings time starts Saturday when I when you go to bed.

[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:38.880]
Spring ahead fall how's that go spring ahead fall back.

[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:42.480]
So put those clocks ahead one hour when you go to bed.

[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.760]
That was down to 103 points. Nice good.

[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:49.480]
A lot of bad numbers floating around in a lot of them on this station to you.

[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.640]
Were you drudge back in?

[01:04:54.540 --> 01:05:04.460]
Are you angry that they got up take my favorite peanut butter they said it could hurt my belly now my

[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:14.020]
TGJ has nothing but the jelly who are they really try to scare you and remove it from the area it is really

[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.780]
idiotic that they didn't ban the sort of peanut product.

[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:28.540]
They took away my peanut butter my favorite brand unlike the one of all because they said we should be

[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:32.100]
aware this whole thing really isn't fair.

[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:44.040]
Wait a minute I found another terrified brand of peanut butter just forget that FDA fella I don't really mind the taste of salmon.

[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:52.520]
All right he's a dead any Alan Sherman I don't know if you ever see Alan Sherman art buck walled at the same time I think they were the same person

[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:56.620]
I think they're both dead I know our buck walls dead I'm sure Alan Sherman must be dead.

[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:01.840]
Hello mother. Hello fine remember that he died in 73 who did Alan Sherman.

[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:09.280]
Wow 73 yeah 36 years ago he's been boy he's not even like Luke warm anymore.

[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:16.180]
He was pretty good he was amusing not hysterical but amusing.

[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:26.000]
Mario says how bad were the numbers for the big oh oh we don't know we can't figure it out because until the whole book comes out we can't do the hourlies we just get

[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:35.920]
6 to 10 10 to 3 3 to 7 like that how about that other queen George Sedano it says great show you happy anniversary says Mario that other queen

[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:41.540]
Jorge Sedano he didn't do so great but he never does so great he talks a lot with a big mouth from what I understand.

[01:06:42.680 --> 01:07:01.400]
And by the way thanks to Sid for that long emotional email when I read a minute ago I guarantee from them you're a cancer you're there you're too old I show up every day and I do the best I can that's so what I do and I have no no apologies to make on under these circumstances

[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:08.500]
I still have a higher number on a radio station what you don't apologize for being too old yeah or for not having gigantic numbers.

[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:20.320]
It must be the fart sounds that must be it. Chuck and Chicago is back he says I think he meant Adam Corolla he was on the man show with Jimmy Kimmel marginally entertaining good for TNA.

[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:39.120]
I never did you ever hear of Adam Corolla yeah you did like a talk show host for something or a comedian all well if he was on the Jimmy Kimmel show he was on like nation wide so the fact that he got 80 trillion hits all this business about how many hits we got on a website well what the hell does that prove what the hell does that prove.

[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.100]
We get a zillion hits on our website every day and I don't sit here to oh geez we got all these hits on the site and all this what what the hell cares about that.

[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:54.780]
We don't get anywhere near as many as we used to get that's because we don't have anywhere near the audience we used to have.

[01:07:55.660 --> 01:08:00.700]
And there's a multiple number of reasons for that part of which is a half the people who want to hear it can't hear it anyway.

[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:10.800]
Which is going to change that's going to change. Oh how's that going to happen you'll see what's that going to happen by the way do we know can we talk about.

[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.980]
I don't know like I said.

[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:21.060]
So what other interesting things in this pile of crap you send me the weekends all the time too why do you do that.

[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:26.740]
I didn't mean to you know anybody who listens to the radio on a weekend it was just in the stack Jack.

[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:30.940]
No you don't like it send it back don't have a hard track.

[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:36.300]
Quack. What the hell do we do with the weekend I think maybe I threw it out I don't know.

[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:46.760]
Oh here it is Saturday and Sunday many team plus WEDR's numero one oh six point two magic is number two with a five point three.

[01:08:48.140 --> 01:09:01.080]
Radio Mambe is number three old men old domino park domino playing group balls green tooth CMQ FAM a radio on more nobody speaks English in South Florida.

[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.020]
All right.

[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:12.480]
Weekend where is where is the big sports station QAM from a 3.8 in the fall that was dolphin down to a 2.9.

[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:19.920]
But that still includes two months of dolphin dolphins once those November December drop out we'll be back to ones.

[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:27.640]
How about waxy we're the house waxy on a weekend what are they got going on a weekend they must have some big time shows on air.

[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:35.500]
I don't see them at all where the how are they oh there they are on the 85th page all know of 0.9 on the weekend.

[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:46.840]
Oh they've been hovering a 1 1 1 1 3 hovering around a one share on a weekend but now they down to a 0.9 on the weekend on waxy 790 where they talk a big game but don't produce

[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.160]
a separate love the tree.

[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:55.280]
Lover tree had a big book and see you got a you you tip your hat to somebody who does that in the midst of an otherwise that death now.

[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.960]
Just like we always have the highest number on this station and he's always got the highest number on that station.

[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:06.680]
What does that tell you that sports talk is oh no they're just not sportsy enough you see.

[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:13.900]
Is that the problem that is leave it to George leave it to little George to figure it out.

[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.680]
We got to get some of those writers on this show.

[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:19.980]
Let's start with a big number like me for that starts with a oh boy.

[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:29.920]
This market is like just Tom jicke writes this is the fake Tom jicke the ticket is carrying kicking serious ass in the afternoon WQM

[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:36.860]
should try to steal him away manages great on the games but his show is a bit ponderous he should be teamed with someone to be effective.

[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.900]
Says the fake Tom jicke.

[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:45.960]
Maybe we could bring Mo back those two got along really well.

[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.500]
There you go.

[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:49.760]
Mad dog in Mo.

[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:55.260]
Mo in the mad dog I like that's got the ring like Mike in the mad dog we got Mo in the mad dog.

[01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:02.500]
308 votes on the pool all time favorite commercial character the where is the beef lady Clara Pellars 76.

[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:10.700]
But why is the lizards 52 Joe roses number three with a 38 until today I never realized for sure he was a commercial character and I thought about it.

[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:11.660]
I just look at him.

[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:16.620]
Yeah he's a character all commercials all the time.

[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:28.520]
What that was that what was that here was that there what did you hear what it sounded like on the outside of somebody screaming.

[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.720]
Outside not outside the hallway but outside outside.

[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.200]
Just strange.

[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:48.240]
So what do we see in this other than it's incredibly heavily ethnic.

[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:57.640]
Radio mom B and La Cubanissima are I mean just it's just madness madness the rush phenomenon.

[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:01.160]
I thought all of us people would be dead by now while the rush thing is you know all right.

[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:09.640]
I bet if we saw the monthlies of it's in December he must have double digits rush he had a gigantic month huge humongous.

[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:18.660]
And of course the rest of the media who are always decrying him for being the bombastic pile of crap that he is and they just can't they just can't get enough.

[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:21.020]
I'm they just can't give enough publicity right.

[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:32.500]
There are people in this world who are maggot magnets there just every time they fart the media wants to know what flavor it was what they had for breakfast that morning.

[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:38.940]
How long did it linger do they get any on their fingers stuff like that.

[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:52.480]
Stern is one of those he's the king of all publicity of all hype and rush is right on his behind the fact rush maybe surpassing him now that Howard's stuck there on a satellite thing that nobody wants to pay for 13 cents by the way

[01:12:52.480 --> 01:13:06.600]
last time I checked today want to check it again okay serious no I'm cereal not serious stock here we go click on that baby and let's take a peek at what it is.

[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:18.540]
You'll know 13 cents let's see come on you can do it very slow 13 cents it's it's hanging right in there started in the day of 14 and that's not the 13 cereal cereal stock.

[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:31.340]
Business is finished baby I told you that long time ago business is all over there you didn't make an excuse is because you're all making sure making all those zillions of dollars which you know good luck to him.

[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:38.120]
The fact is he's talking to like a fraction a tiny fraction of the audience he used to have on the so called evil terrestrial radio.

[01:13:38.820 --> 01:14:02.220]
And that's because on and in his case see he doesn't he doesn't need to make the excuse because we all know that he couldn't do his show on terrestrial radio because all these zillions of fines that infinity was getting because of a certain bunch of nip nicks out there with their complaints to the FCC and anybody who's even familiar with the business marginally slightly knows that that's put a chill and killing on a lot of shows.

[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:08.460]
I wonder if they're like protesting or something outside protesting what you.

[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:13.080]
Yeah protesting me you know I was a cancer on South Florida I'm a cancer here.

[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.900]
I'm going to be a doctor when you're married Catherine.

[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:17.540]
Jesus.

[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:16.840]
I'm going to be a doctor when you're married.

[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:46.160]
I'm going to be a doctor when you're married.

[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:50.600]
I'm 45 at 560 WQ AM.

[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:58.020]
I mean you look at these numbers and what does it say that we don't get bonus that's what it says.

[01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:12.200]
Oh I know that when you know something you could be wrong about that right person's 25 54 let me take a few cadet again we had a two six that means we got about a 5.2 share in men 10 to 3 which means we could be close to a six year in men 10 to 2.

[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:16.160]
Okay so how bad could that be?

[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:25.100]
It could be worse could be a lot worse especially when you see persons 25 54 the top top number is a life with a 5.5.

[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:35.880]
It's just other than rush other than I would deal with all their all the right wing all day all the time other than that there's nothing going on other than ethnic.

[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:52.540]
And when you see the top number being a 5.4 share of 5.5 of 5.4 another 5.4 you got a three way tie for a second in persons 25 54 midday hot 105 the coast and CMQ F.A.M.A.

[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:54.020]
No speaking English.

[01:16:56.740 --> 01:17:04.640]
Well but you're up there in Toronto deal with all those Chinese on India yeah that's right now I'm glad to stay here pleased please just punch.

[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:12.000]
And you know something though now I feel extra foolish you want to know why why?

[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:18.620]
Because there was all this I mean we went through that first hour we didn't get a single number to 11 o'clock right right.

[01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:30.220]
And all these emails oh geez we need the numbers everybody's all whipped up about the number and now that we got them and I gave them out on the year as many as I felt necessary to give out that we care about.

[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:39.420]
What's the response other than that rabid piece of swill from across the street where's the response?

[01:17:39.420 --> 01:18:00.420]
But you're right man obsessed obsessed doesn't come close to describing the the hysteria between this place and across the street and they're both and they're both fighting tooth and nail over a tiny like Ramo would say a sliver of a slice.

[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:08.280]
A sliver of a slice a beater and the bastard does a four or four in there and the rest of the station does ones.

[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.040]
And I think what they have in midday a two to.

[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:20.540]
I don't know sports talk is I told you this two years ago two three years ago it's dead dead and I keep arguing with you.

[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:24.540]
Everybody's on your brother everybody their brother is doing sports talk now.

[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:32.880]
How much can you say the douse down 201 points by the way sorry sorry to bring you the bad news sorry.

[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:43.980]
Here's one from Bambi love the show you and George are great but I especially relate to George since he's a married man who is having problems with the wife just like me.

[01:18:47.860 --> 01:19:11.620]
My wife is a bitch just like George's and I can't remember the last time I had sex with either these days the closest thing I get to an orgasm is listen to your show I love it and helps me get through stressful times with my bitch wife says Bambi well maybe if you step on yourself Bambi you might get laid you know I'm sure that's just for email purposes I say real name is probably something that is what I call a deer like butch.

[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:24.180]
Here are your baby baby is real name is book yeah sure it's how I'm butch I'll guarantee you that well that that's the response we got so far after going through all this business with an update there's nothing.

[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:35.760]
Not even the fake Jimmy syphilis bragging about how we had that for nine in the morning of course when you got an eight one there in midday with rush all the ditto heads all the time they all had the diaries.

[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:45.260]
Not amazing yep and also all the in those speaking English people are like we said before it's not a coincidence it's always the same thing yep.

[01:19:46.960 --> 01:20:03.260]
When we have a heavy ethnic book we also get a heavy right wing book heavy heavy heavy duty come on Easter come on Easter that's never going to change you think that a lot of those people who died off already once listening to radio mambi and come off like Cuban is no they're never going to die.

[01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:13.840]
Oh that's what I'm hanging on I may be old but I'm hanging on long enough to see if I can't wait till the demographic change a little bit.

[01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:25.620]
And the amazing part of it is the election datebroward Palm Beach Monroe Obama overwhelming one Florida pretty handling the whole state.

[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:33.400]
And yet if you look at these radio numbers you think that the right wingers are just dominate in a right mean no what dominate.

[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:49.940]
330 votes on the pool all time favorite commercial character whereas the beef lady Clara Peller 82 but why is your lizards 54 Joe Rose 40 a monster in the commercial industry caveman 37 the gecko 29 who George hates.

[01:20:54.060 --> 01:21:10.080]

[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:22.420]
There is no response nothing about those numbers nothing no commentary no observation no reaction no hey we did great no you guys suck no this blah blah blah nothing.

[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:33.840]
And here I was all in a in a frenzy in a panic yeah practically ping in my pantaloonies figuring that we were we couldn't get those damn numbers.

[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:40.080]
Listen doesn't matter if they don't care they matter to us they do yeah.

[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:52.760]
Oh you're starting with that bonus money crap again are you I thought I thought you know I'm not piped reading or anything like that but if we are going to get any money or a measure of success or something then you know this is it this is the indicator.

[01:21:54.680 --> 01:22:03.760]
Yeah but didn't you hear that email we got yesterday saying that ratings mean nothing oh yeah unless the course it's across the street if you get some big book like he did then they mean.

[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:10.840]
Something if we get them all nobody cares about that blah blah blah blah glad you understand the difference that's right.

[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:18.300]
Oh a piece of copy honey like that wow yeah that's revised.

[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:28.460]
Who revised the did holy moly go crazy don't forget or nearly right about now we'd be doing our Neil deal we don't have a restaurant this week.

[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:45.740]
We will have one next week we got the field next week and we still have 11 certificates left for East City Grill and seven for Kigsaw the Kendall most of them went which is good we still have a few left so if you're Jones into a pick one up go to WQM dot com and click on it give it a click.

[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:58.100]
So what's your observation here nothing we're not going to get paid well we have a truck if you paid but I'm not going to hold my breath 25 54 you never know maybe we'll get a kiss and I have one

[01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:04.920]
observation what's that all these people are we want the calls we went we did okay we didn't do great that's for damn sure that's right.

[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:12.020]
But we went up a little bit I think mostly that's a byproduct of dropping off that bad October that I told you about yes you can see it.

[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:18.580]
But nevertheless we probably must have held our own so to speak I like this kind of little do format.

[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.580]
On the new format we can I mean we can track all out yeah.

[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:32.960]
Well sure it didn't make any difference that it took that long to get it because it dragged you know created a little bit of drama there a little drama for your mama.

[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.960]
And nobody cares about it anyway obviously right.

[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:45.600]
Oh here's Jimmy Cifilis here we go what did I tell you we're having a huge rating party in the building I'm providing some fine wine as much I hate to say it sports radio is on the decline.

[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:51.660]
Oh that's from the fake Jimmy Cifilis as much as I hate to say it sports radio is on the decline.

[01:23:52.500 --> 01:24:01.720]
On the decline as if it's over Jimmy it's over the voice of the dolphins all I think he's getting canned on that deal.

[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.720]
We have a big ratings party with our cheap channel.

[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.240]
Well look at this a new piece of copy what's going on here that Barney Miller man this guy's okay.

[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:13.740]
He's on fire.

[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.220]
He ain't no muff but he's okay.

[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:19.220]
So Gary Starner's gone again huh wow what a bummer.

[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:23.460]
The drive way is Hummer.

[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:28.220]
No I think he drives a Jaguar or does he also know that's probably coming.

[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:33.260]
How's your cardio coming oh you're funny when's your show start.

[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:46.500]
So in other words they just they're just leaving in the lurch they're doing anything for you and despite whatever was written down in that thing that we talked about and everything like that despite whatever Chris Jones wrote down in his notebook or

[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:50.500]
or any discussions I think it has yet to have been brought up in a sales meeting.

[01:24:52.660 --> 01:25:00.600]
So really yeah so they're just fun in you that's right they're just lying which is what they do best they're just lying to you.

[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:08.940]
Well here we are yep I'm feeling pretty good these days I'm I'm doing fine.

[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:19.940]
Meet the one a few hundred bucks yesterday not huge but you know not enough to buy me dinner and Paco enough to buy some Britney Spears tickets.

[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:29.640]
I still don't understand that why is it that young gay guys are enamored with Britney Spears can you explain that to me I can't.

[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:37.100]
So we all got with her I've assessed all of that stuff the whole like we were talking this morning Judy Garland and Liza.

[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:43.780]
But that's that's faghags though see there's a difference I was Britney a faghag I don't know wait I don't know.

[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:52.960]

[01:25:54.420 --> 01:26:02.860]
That's right Nan or Nanner she's a Yahoo man look at that Kevin feeder line yep he's the poster child for red neckie.

[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:17.800]
You can't complain about the audience he's going to bring over to 940 because there won't be any.

[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:24.360]
Me foe I think it'll bring a lot more people to sports now that's true maybe the right peri show will be on 940.

[01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:28.760]
This is really sad this email.

[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:40.580]
Can you see us raising 2.2 I can't see us raising 2.2 dollars to be honest I don't want to sound negative but can you can you see us raising 2.2 bucks.

[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:47.560]

[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:32.320]
Yep am I right yes yes you are. Oh I mean I'm looking at the pool and all the things that we got on there and I just don't see Vince or Billy May's fitting in with those people and Mr. Wipple he did commercials he didn't do it in

[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:47.320]
commercials right he's still squeezing it by the way he's squeezing it that big turl it up in the sky baby I wonder if they if the fart smell in heaven they don't have a body remember I understand that now why you

[01:30:47.320 --> 01:31:00.320]
like intellectualizing you might be this one guy he's a stockbroker and he shows up at wood by an every afternoon every day he's probably got his clients money that he's popping in the machines and as he's sitting there playing the

[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:11.420]
machine he intellectualizes every pool every play well you know diagonal yadi yadi and if I only play two the spin shows up more often I'm going to be

[01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:20.240]
joicing in the moment from the numbers no I don't think from the numbers just from life just from whatever I eat yesterday which I'm sure was ample I don't

[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:30.420]
remember what it was but it was ample when you're as fat as I am you don't you don't go days without yeah I'm thinking about joicing right in the chair right

[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:43.500]
now the numbers were like I thought they would be weak weak weak weak when you combine you know not having any material that were allowed to play that you

[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:50.740]

[01:31:57.300 --> 01:32:06.280]
describe it sure stagnant I don't think it's stagnant because I don't think we're as low as we can go oh I'm sure that I think they're in a meeting right now to figure out how to

[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:18.880]
drive what's right how can we get down to a nice comfortable one point oh how can we do that all across the board all day long we had a two on in the afternoon in men 18 plus and a

[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:11.300]
retired barber Joe Godluski says he was inspired by television chefs who repeatedly recommended kosher salt and

[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:15.940]
recipes I said what the heck's the matter with Christian salt Godluski said

hopes to market the salt through Christian bookstores and there's a fundraising tool for religious groups Arnie

[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:56.180]
and Godluski's 73 said to share the proceeds will be donated to Christian charities but neither would

[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:12.180]
ignorance about Jewish dietary laws he said all salt is inherently kosher because it occurs

[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:18.060]
naturally and requires little or no processing certified kosher foods are not blessed by rabbi's

[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:22.360]

I'll go to you that that's the problem George keeps saying just this morning it's gotta be

[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:45.820]
he said course grain kosher salt is named for the way in which it was traditionally used

[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:50.520]
to draw blood from firstly butchered meat because Jewish law prohibits consuming blood

[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:56.300]
chefs often favor kosher salt because it's crunchy and easy to pinch

[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:01.140]

[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:26.320]
wrong about that although a lot of what we got on probably there are some people don't want to

[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:31.560]

fat man after dark says sorry to be a chronic email or but on your commercial breaks online we

[02:16:47.390 --> 02:16:52.630]
get these ads from flea for something called stripped down sports on wqm.com sponsored by Tutsi's

[02:16:54.690 --> 02:16:58.530]
and then he goes on in noxid i can appreciate a horse as much as next you have with these girls

[02:16:58.530 --> 02:17:06.090]
look like they were just brought inside after working a street corner well so very costed

[02:17:06.090 --> 02:17:11.170]
hey at least we don't still have that same crap on the audio on the commercial breaks okay

[02:17:11.170 --> 02:17:18.670]
thankfully for that so so what was the um bottom line is to all the delay with the numbers today

[02:17:18.670 --> 02:17:23.430]
what was that all about apparently he's got as much pull as i do or maybe just slightly more

[02:17:24.430 --> 02:17:28.850]
because he doesn't get access to that website i don't get access to that website you don't so we

[02:17:28.850 --> 02:17:33.350]
had a way to clearance to get there duff brought the numbers in force duff's got access huh yeah

[02:17:33.350 --> 02:17:37.710]
from the olden days i presume that's because he still got the naked pictures of Greg and all the other

[02:17:40.250 --> 02:17:45.250]
employees because he used to be the pd so he knows how to do that well thank god for duff

[02:17:45.250 --> 02:17:51.830]
duff is the only hope we got that's it and flea to a lesser extent you know if it's a flea

[02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:56.990]
thinks he's got the inside wijali joe bell which maybe he does do a point but it's got its limits

[02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:14.290]
a m station should be all sports then we'll have a chance to get a need of marks out of aldemore we get

[02:31:14.290 --> 02:31:19.890]
here on there so Greg Vidal and i'm positive it's the real one because he's got no life at all

[02:31:20.370 --> 02:31:24.910]
who's on the radio from ten to two loudmouth piece of atheistic jiu he's doing poetry now

[02:31:30.470 --> 02:31:34.410]
that a bastard is kicking mad dogs ass in the afternoon but what doesn't sound like it is

[02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:40.630]
it's happening four four two one you do the math you think jiu made a mistake getting rid of

[02:31:40.630 --> 02:31:48.990]
a hank oh my god what a Greg's that must be that was funny back on a soss again i agree with the

[02:31:48.990 --> 02:31:53.370]
person said manage to be teamed up with another host he is best playing the colorful wildman he needs

[02:31:53.370 --> 02:31:58.990]
the straight guy bill wise and Gary Bruce would team him up with chozo gaki sunny hursher rick weaver

[02:31:58.990 --> 02:32:04.270]
he worked oh yeah it worked then also it's surrounded himself with a number of side kicks out of

[02:32:04.270 --> 02:32:09.050]
howard stern this is proven to be successful one man talking on a microphone is no longer the trend

[02:32:09.050 --> 02:32:16.370]
unless your name is rush or savage says Greg Vidal who's got way too much time i have no life on his hand

[02:32:18.030 --> 02:32:24.710]
weren't you impressed no no daylight savings time setter night when you go to bed turn your

[02:32:24.710 --> 02:32:29.970]
clocks ahead one hour you lose an hour sleep but who they'll curious get all that daylight back

[02:32:31.050 --> 02:32:35.890]
now down there then they call that much difference but here oh who do i want to get dark at

[02:32:35.890 --> 02:32:42.570]
4 30 in the winter time i don't know that piers that was down to it in 50 points not good nish

[02:32:42.570 --> 02:32:49.110]
good don says you're sure it's great no matter how you handle calls and or emails but i must say

[02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:54.430]
that i like to call in format much better fact is that although most callers suck most

[02:32:54.430 --> 02:32:59.230]
e-mailers also suck so either way calling or emailing most people have nothing to say and just

[02:32:59.230 --> 02:33:05.570]
suck in my opinion rather hear the idiots that call then listen you read the emails live interaction

[02:33:05.570 --> 02:33:09.330]
makes for better show in my opinion maybe take calls two or three times a week into the email thing

[02:33:09.330 --> 02:33:14.450]
the other two days also this beastly really own that awful station that mr. ego and d4 are now on

[02:45:48.830 --> 02:45:52.310]
i was disappointed last week when george inside kick out a call from a young man who was suffering

[02:45:52.310 --> 02:45:56.650]
from crippling anxiety he said he was a parent that guy was reaching out for a friendly voice but

[02:45:56.650 --> 02:46:00.730]
instead the guys made light of his ordeal and blew him off they could have given the poor guys some

[02:46:00.730 --> 02:46:04.710]
advice and assurance they're sending a little human warmth then and only then would have been

[02:46:04.710 --> 02:46:08.890]
just in proper to make sport of his suffering and we could all join together mocking him shame on

[02:46:08.890 --> 02:46:13.870]

juno is very cool but try not to be distracted by the occasional stupid music in the film

[02:46:39.130 --> 02:46:42.810]
