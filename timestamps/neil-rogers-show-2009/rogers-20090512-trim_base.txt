With all those guns

[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.820]

[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.560]

[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.160]
Yeah

[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.000]

It has a nine point

[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.740]
The barb the star looked just like the hopper

[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.200]
There would be smile on each of those

[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.520]

[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.700]
Tom jicke thank goodness wrote that piece in the paper

[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.220]
Now if Tommy jicke writes it you know

[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.960]
It can't be a BS

[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.480]

[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.420]

Like you always say what goes around comes around

[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.440]
I'm I supposed to be able to decipher that what does that mean?

[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.480]
I don't know

[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.680]
Like you always say what goes around comes around

[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.920]
Ahmed ishma

[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.260]
Ishmaq I have no idea what that means

[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.460]
Maybe it could be a little more explicit

[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.520]
What you be talking about

[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.840]
What you be talking about ishma

[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.460]
Ahmed Mohammed shorts

Here's the poll result from yesterday

[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.840]

[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.820]

[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.280]
Thousand twelve votes

Patrick Swayze 205

[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.360]
He's got a lung problem

[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.120]
Now is that a

[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.780]
Smoking thing or what

[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.560]
I don't know

[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.600]
In his case

[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.700]
I don't really care

[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.800]
I don't want to sound insensitive

[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.820]
But I never liked Patrick Swayze in the first place

[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.240]
In fact, I dislike him intensely

[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.060]
And I thought I hope he dies or anything like that

[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.700]
But he will

[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.320]
Mickey Rooney 1-0-8

[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.140]
He's going to die someday

[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.820]
What do we figure out?

[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.840]
He's like 90 almost

[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.280]
Almost

[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.780]
Dan near 90

[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.060]

John Madden 39

[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.700]
Liz Taylor was a late addition and she

[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.380]
She jump-frogged me

[00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.180]
Leap-froged

[00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.480]
38 for Liz

[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.800]
37 for me

[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.460]
Moe Howard Davided

[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.860]
He made a late move 23

The brain stem 11 and Donald Trump only 9

[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.900]
How do I fit in with these other people

[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.980]
And Moe also

[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.960]
Big celebrity

[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.980]
I don't know

[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.940]
This obsession with

[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.420]
With South Florida radio people

[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.220]
It's just I don't know what to say about it

[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.820]
It's embarrassing

[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.000]
To me

[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.880]
No you're a superstar

[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.580]
And by the way no more stupid

[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.880]
The phony TKS crap

[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.760]
You know all you

[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.000]
It's just just nauseating

[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.060]
Was the same thing with Sirius

[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.540]
Oh Sirius wants you Neil

[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.760]
And blah blah blah blah

[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.040]
And blah blah that

[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.260]
Bubba Miceys

[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.840]
That's what they are

[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.680]
Bubba Miceys

[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.200]
All these stories

[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.440]
Anyway you'll be pleased to know

[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.160]
That Norma Kent is going to bat for George

[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.720]
With a letter on legal stationery

[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.260]
Who

[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.840]
Don't you think that'll scare him

[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.600]
Wow

[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.680]
Yeah

[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.220]
It's scary

[00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.780]
Norma Kent letterhead

[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.960]
I read it to you this morning

[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.400]
Yep

[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.760]
About how um

[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.320]
You know we're standing by our guns on the contract

[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.180]
And no it has to be mutual agreement

[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.220]
And we don't agree to flee or anybody beside George

[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.920]
And that's

[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.480]
That's the way it works

[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.420]
Although I've got some real

[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.180]
Firm instruction here

[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.700]
Here's one

[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.840]
Here's the definitive one

[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.780]
Everything is my fault

[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.540]
This is from the fake Julio Robaina

[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.180]
Oh great

[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.580]
The truth about the George situation

[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.580]
And it says the truth about the George situation

[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.340]
Is that you need to share on the responsibility

[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.200]
I'm a regular listener

[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.300]
And I'm aware of your part in the George injustice

[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.160]
My part

[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.260]
Other hosts take care of people like George

[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.360]
And make them part of the shows

[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.160]
I thought you were part of the show

[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.500]
Okay

[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.260]
For example Paul Castanova has made his number one producer

[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.380]
Part of the show employed by him and paid by him

[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.800]
Now you tell me that's not correct

[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.600]
No he's on Paul's contract but he's not paid by Paul

[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.220]
Oh

[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.400]
So if the management ever decides to cut this producer

[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.880]
Without cause the management will have to

[00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.980]
Fire the whole show

[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.500]
But the love spongebob was banished by a cheap channel

[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.740]
And was out of work for two years

[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.620]
But in that time he continued to pay his three guys

[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.360]
A portion of their salary out of his own pocket

[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.220]
Additionally in his will

[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.600]
He's already left all the intellectual property of his show

[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.660]
To his producers individually and as a group

[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.560]
In his will

[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.020]
Those are examples of hosts who take care of their boys

[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.800]
You've been with George for approximately 20 years

[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.800]
And all you do is put a clause in your contract

[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.420]
That allows you to choose your producer

[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.880]
But doesn't protect the one you have

[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.500]
I already heard you say there's no way you're willing to pay him out of your pocket

[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.360]
If it would have been a year ago when I was making the really big bucks

[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.200]
I had to pay the whole salary out of my pocket

[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.540]
If but it's not

[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.960]
Says of course not

[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.960]
I always thought that the people who said that you backstab the burger overstating it

[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.380]
But now I see what you're capable of doing to people who demonstrate it loyalty and dedication

[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.820]
If I were George I would leave you in a lurch right now and start looking for jobs right now

[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.220]
Oh yeah

[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.260]
And leave me in a lurch are you

[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.200]
Oh yeah

[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.620]
At least he won't do that

[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.260]
It's shameful what you're doing and if George loses this job

[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:59.480]
You lose me as a listener because I hold you responsible in part and you'll thank you for your time good luck George

[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.060]
Are you threatening me from the fake Julio Robaina

[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.640]
Whose English is improved dramatically by the way since those

[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.680]
embarrassing emails about

[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.060]
Harness racing and highly which turned out was the not but never learned maybe took a class

[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.700]
I'm not paying George's salary. I never have and I never got I can't give George health benefits or any other benefits

[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.720]
I'm not running that kind of a company. I do have my own company, but it's a one-man company and that's me

[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.000]
And as far as the bird was concerned consider his salary which I did not also pay that that was charity

[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:37.920]
That's the way I look at the bird's salary 50 grand a year to sit there and cackel and eat free food every day and just shut up

[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.500]
occasionally chime in with something useful which became less and less often

[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.340]
Like that

[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.000]
Did you say to the bird yeah did you say to the bird

[00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.160]
Oh

[00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.560]

Not Paco he's sleeping

[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.700]
Well, I'm having real difficulty sorry

[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.900]
One moment please no problem

[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:25.920]
Oh

[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.760]
There he is he's not in that's it

[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.100]
Feel the breeze

[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.620]
Okay, that's enough

[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.660]
I'm through typing fast

[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.740]
Anyway getting back to let's see here's one from John who says Johnny B from Boka

[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.180]
if we have if we have to

[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:49.280]
Do

[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.240]
I'll tell you the the stuff that these people write it's so

[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.220]
So lock and sloppy, but then I'll take whatever I get

[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.960]
If we have to have an end to the dynasty of nila George then a new era has to start

[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.040]
unfortunately if you remove someone

[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.840]
Most of the time replacement doesn't work out nor does the next one how many producers do you have before George?

[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.760]
Oh, I would say

[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.140]
a bunch

[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.080]
I've listened to you for over 18 years

[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.200]
You are the talent on the show and keep the ratings high regardless of the hurdles management is put in your path

[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.420]
This is a big one

[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.920]
We will see who does well the first time your ill or go on vacation is flea gonna do a four-hour show on the fly

[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.840]
no pun intended

[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.920]
On the fly you think flea is gonna fly

[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.380]
No pun intended regards Johnny B from Boka

[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.540]
Think flea can fly I don't know

[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:47.700]
Here's one from Jeff who says I hate George and flea like poison. What was that nice isn't that sweet isn't that typical?

[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.060]
South Florida hate

[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:56.900]
I here's one I think that's pretty now you always have said

[00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.860]
That there's no difference between the two stations generally outside of this show correct

[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:09.220]
This one says last night both WQA and 790 had the same ESPN radio shawan from around midnight to 5 a.m

[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.340]
How can this be how can that be

[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.720]
Are we paying money for ESPN?

[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.920]
I mean, does it really make a difference if you put the two numbers together? They're probably still like that

[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.020]
In fact in the last book didn't they have a from one to five a.m. across the street a point?

[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.420]
I think so I could be wrong. I know from 10 to 11 p.m. We had a point. Oh, but that's you know who cares about that

[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.860]
Right sounds like no picking and it picking to me

[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.980]
The ESPN radio how about those black hawks how about the young hot Patrick Kane? Oh, baby. Oh

[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.120]
Baby is right Patrick last night and they decide in game

That was a medley of his man. He got funny. You're way after that show. I saw this thing when he was a old already

[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.160]
Actually very funny and he didn't do the dynamite

[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.140]
You didn't uh, you know, he wasn't silly or goofy. What about Gary Coleman? What about him?

[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:33.400]
The midget what about him little black midget there are too many black midgets, you know what I say? No, I haven't noticed that

[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.720]
Well, I'll just name me another one beside Gary Coleman. Other black midget. I can't name you any

[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.000]
Hey, uh-huh. Neither can I any midget. That's my point. How many midgets can you name?

[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:46.840]
See what he told you midgets? There was job. What was his name? Johnny Pileo the harmonica

[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:51.180]
Billy Barty Billy Barty that's a good one. That was down eight points by the way

[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.120]
Oh

[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:53.860]
Tom jicke

[00:21:53.860 --> 00:22:01.260]
Dave Lamont was on this morning defending his title of mr. karaoke and beat Ralphie May. Who cares fake Tom jicke

[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:06.360]
About though. I see Paul and it's not enough that they got their eight two share and they kicked ass in the book

[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.620]
That's not enough. They still want to continue siphoning from the show

[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:17.740]
Here's one that says Neil. I think you're overlooking the person who will be most affected should fat ass Joe Bell terminate George

[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.960]
That would be George's wife who may have to get a job after all this time

[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:25.420]
A real tragedy created by that turd T-I-R-D turd Joe Bell

[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.320]
Oh Jimmy syphilis is back

[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.000]
I caught my producer manny twittering about you

[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.120]
I told him if I was said if he was such a fan of yours

[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.120]
He should apply to be your producer. He's been warned in the past about his oil. These are the station

[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:45.280]
He's banned from listening to your show. I will not have a mole on my show says the fake Jimmy syphilis. How do you like that?

[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.460]
And

1032 more what cowbell and what does that mean? Well, you know what a cowbell is right? Yeah more is better

[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.780]
Blackie says in fact I had two

[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.700]
Carney pointed out that Webster is a black magic

[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.060]
Emmanuel right

[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.000]
Blackie says I'm glad you enjoyed my last email about the loss of TV stars

[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.540]
There was another African American midget the kid that played Webster and Emmanuel Lewis was his name

[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:34.620]
You remember that show Alex Keras played the father. He's also dead Alex Keras former Detroit Lions

[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.280]
Was lame

[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.640]
Not as lame as Frank Gifford, but then not too many were

[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.560]
Giff the Gifford

[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:57.680]
Scott and panelists Park says the association were on Warner Brothers at that time WB's 45s had an orange label

[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.020]
Well, I'll be damned

[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:05.420]
One reason my synatra was unrepreased he owned labels same reason my Nancy Snatra was out of this well

[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.180]
These boots are made for what down down down down. Remember that

[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.920]
If she's sing or what he belt out an ounce of sound Nancy Snatra

Don't be a sour puss

[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:32.880]
Nancy Snatra you keep saying you got something for me. I never had to follow up

[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.840]
Email on my course. I don't get anything on my space anyway

[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.820]
I never had to follow up from Ricky Tiki Shaw

[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:43.120]
No, it was given me lessons about how to do a talk show there back in March whenever the hell he sent me that

[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.340]
Astonishing to me it was astonishing

[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:52.140]
Well, let's compromise. I didn't always negotiating how to do my show with you Rick. Let's compromise

[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.000]
Few calls few emails no calls

[00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:00.760]
How many months since I've taken a call on the show other than Dave Johnson will be talking to Friday again

[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.780]
anticipation of the freakness

[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.040]
I wonder is the Philly gonna be running in there with house her name

[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.860]
The great Philly Rachel Alexandra

[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.800]
Because if the Philly runs in the freakness and Calvin Borrell is gonna ride her as opposed to

[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.000]
That the piece of crap at that great horse that won the Derby

[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:25.400]
That's circle circle the field on the rail as Bob Savage would say but he's dead too Bobby Savage

[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.820]
So many dead people, you know what?

[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:34.160]
Yep as you go through life. That's one of the things that happens is uh, although I guess it's not a bad thing from your perspective

[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.360]
You're still alive and all those other people are dead, but nevertheless don't make light of people's death

[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.440]
Bob Savage little Bobby

[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.440]
He came up to your knee he was a magic

[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.180]
I don't know if you'd call him a magic. What constitutes a midget?

[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.960]
I don't know well Gary Coleman might not be because he's he had health problems

[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.820]
Oh, and his growth was stung it as a result so he just turned out really short

[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.220]
I see

[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:04.080]
But I think that a you know, they like to be called little people collectively really

[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:10.760]
But there's a different right but there's a difference between being a dwarf and a big how about Billy J. Cramer little children

[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.280]
How we play they all hate this conversation but whatever

[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.320]
What the little people they hate the conversation about them

[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:22.640]
Well being called dwarves and midgets and things like dwarf. I didn't say a little dwarf. I wouldn't do both

[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.280]
A little dwarf

[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.780]
That's beautiful. Oh, let's see blackie says he's all over the place here blackie

[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.840]
I was in the airport on the food line the other day when my food was ready to work or called my number my number was

[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.480]
77 so I yelled wabc

[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.460]
Boy poor impressionable blackie, huh

[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.380]
Do you really believe that that he did that 77?

[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:58.180]
No, I bet they were looking at him like strange like are you something wrong with you mine

[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.880]
He says any good emails from anyone who went to exotica know I didn't have any emails from anybody who went to exotica

[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:10.320]
George hang in there. It'll be their loss if they can you how did your DJ and go the other night and F Joe Bell

[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.060]
He says with several exclamation points

[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.720]
Okay, how did your DJ and go it was fun. I didn't do a lot of DJing. I did some but it was a good time

[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.160]
Where was that at club exit in Hollywood?

[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:27.580]
For a I see a ray vesque kind of a party thing there were four DJ rooms or

[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.000]
Real dudes going on real DJ's I was DJ trainee

[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.540]
Mike and Bokas says uncle Eli emailed you months ago

[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.380]
I listened to bubble while working in tampon late 80s

[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:39.600]
I listened this morning

[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.460]
He's bragging that they're number one in Tampa because they knocked MJ out of the top spot. Who's MJ?

[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.920]
I don't know Michael Jackson. No seriously. Who's MJ?

[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.740]
Like I'm supposed to know who that is

[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:53.480]
It's tough to syndicate and serve all your listeners and not appear that you're in Tampa. It says

[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:02.800]
I see well it's a Tampa show all or he kicked ass 18 and 34 men with that seven share got a tip your little cap to him for that

[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:07.260]
Don't you me? I don't have to but we should I'll go put one on the tip it

[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.400]
Go put on a baseball cap your big Marlene's fan

[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.260]
How about those black hocks, huh George who?

[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:21.140]
Chicago black hocks beat the Vancouver conucks four games to two one seven to five last night

[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:26.980]
I had tricked by the hot sizzling Patrick Kane number 88 he's great and I want to date

[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.940]
What what is this picture of

[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:40.960]
Manculture and some dark-complexed guy. I have no idea who that is one of Johnny

[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.520]
One of Jimmy Walker's pals. Oh, I said mj Schmidt

[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.840]
How do you get that from that?

[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:54.260]
mj Schmidt yeah, oh here's one that says there are many dead people Alex carous is not one of them

[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.600]
God, I thought that big fat tub. I mean, I thought he was in and the somebody else's

[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.880]
biography for Alex carous still alive

[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.280]
I'll be damned

[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.560]
Well, we learned something already to at least I did I thought for sure he was dead

[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.080]
Alex carous

[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.720]
How do you like that?

[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:15.560]
A black dwarf is a white dwarf that's cooled out enough at a no longer emits light

[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:26.140]
See the magic of the universe science pages. Yeah, well, let's get a little scientific here for Christ's sake

[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.240]
A little boy

[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.300]
Excuse me

[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:29.560]
Oh

[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:36.960]
Let's hear what promises. I don't know if you mentioned it, but as the roles characterist Florida started out as the made on mod for about a year or two

[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.780]
Then I think mod had some English made question mark. I don't know. I didn't watch mod

[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:46.940]
I couldn't stand her she died be Arthur just croaked right the rules are a very large family who live all over South

[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:51.520]
Florida and they originally come from the Bahamas man. Oh my god. The rules come from the Bahamas

[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.300]
You

[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.740]
MJ is Todd Schmidt and he's a tool says Paul

[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:05.780]
Well, I'll be damned. Yeah, that's that's where the big battle is isn't it that we're always hearing between Baba and

[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.680]
Todd the Schmidt Meister. Yeah

[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.740]
Sounds very parochial and of no interest to us

[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.960]
Certainly not to me. I don't I don't really care

[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:20.640]
He's 73 and turns 74 in July 15 Alex carous who cares

[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.400]
I'm so sorry. I mentioned his name

[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.060]
Big fat x football x-jock

[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.660]
So many x-jocks and so little time you know what and most of them on the air

[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.640]
He was on Monday night football. I was curious. I'm sure you saw you caught that

[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.280]
Every Monday so it was rush for about two minutes. Mm-hmm

[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.860]
How'd that work out? Well, I'll tell you one thing. Oh Johnny dark

[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:47.180]
Whoa

[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:58.880]
Here's one that says Neil and George Neil a few days ago an emailer asked you about the James crystal radio group and before you could respond social security called

[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:05.180]
By the way, let me say it again. That was my mistake social security had sent it check in there on time and my bad and I called them back and left the long

[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:06.200]
tearful message

[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:14.740]
How can you have 50,000 watts of power no ratings? What does WFTL stand for fascist talk leader Joyce Kaufman WTFI

[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.060]
Looks like when joebell finally gets you in George out

[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.840]
I won't be listening to radio anymore. Love the shows is Ron from Boka

[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.920]
We're not going anywhere Ron. We're staying

[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:31.380]
Oh, I see Scott and Penel's parks is Schmidt does the MJ show on WFLC in the mornings

[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:37.900]
Then does his Lord as junior show in the afternoons from a different studio in the gandy boulevard dungeon. I'll be damned

[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:43.480]
How do you like that? You think you've got source? How do you like to have to do two shows a day to a survive?

[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.320]
Oh better than Johnny dark says although I have compassion for George and his family

[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:51.500]
I can't help but feel this is an act of karma for what you and George did to the bird

[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.460]
Glenn was the best producer you ever had and you stabbed him in the back

[00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.240]
Not only that, but when I came in as a friend to have lunch with you in the studio you stabbed me in the back

[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:05.300]
You acted like I was a fan off the street. I've been doing radio for as long as George has been alive

[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:12.260]
Do you forget I did mid days at the great WNBC from 1977 to 84 following Don I'm as shame on you. This is Johnny dork

[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.100]
Well shame on you Johnny

[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:20.660]
You know Neil God looking for the pot. Oh, yeah, what's kind of a funny story

[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:25.000]
I was invited over here for this big secret international pot smoking competition

[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:28.540]
For

[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:59.120]
Oh

[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:04.100]
All right page

[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.260]
Cong잖아

[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.960]
I just heard the government a haklok comments like you get me just no marijuana.

[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:14.640]
Yeah.

[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.800]
It's just these guys nicked and suds and whatever the heck it is and the people I call in,

[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:27.380]
they're just like them like that they were on the water court, the weed and they're high and they're...

[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.720]
I mean it's terrible.

[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:29.420]
Yeah.

[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.080]
The years that I've been looking at, listening to 610.

[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:33.800]
To now this.

[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.920]
And this here.

[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.220]
And this here.

[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:37.780]
1047.

[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.840]
I wonder if she's dead yet.

[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:39.880]
Whoever the hell she was.

[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:40.820]
Nasty old bitch.

[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.380]
No, probably.

[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.520]
Hateful old son.

[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.260]
That's one thing a lot of the hateful bastards that called over the years.

[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.200]
They're pushing up daffodils.

[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.060]
Where did that expression come from?

[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:49.980]
Pushing up daisies.

[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.400]
Oh, that should be obvious.

[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.360]
Well, I mean you're in the ground, but how about pushing up the hydrangeas?

[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.080]
I guess somebody liked to sound a daisies.

[00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.900]
As in driving mess.

[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:00.640]
Right.

[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.060]
Here's one from Alejandro, the fake Alejandro.

[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.260]
I know you're loyal to a fault, but it really is time for George to go.

[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.900]
I've been listening to your show since the days of the bird.

[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.020]
And when George took over, I had high hopes for an exciting change of pace.

[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.080]
However, George has been a drag on the show since day one.

[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.500]
And I'll be glad when he goes.

[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.060]
He's a nattering nae-bob of negativity who adds nothing.

[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.000]
Could be a nattering nae-bob of negativity.

[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.020]
Are you a nattering nae-bob of negativity yet?

[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.420]
He's never been anywhere or done anything yet.

[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.040]
He acts as always qualified to offer an opinion on things he knows nothing about.

[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.920]
He talks about suge, yet he is the biggest suit I've ever heard.

[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.800]
I mean, Christ, the guy goes roller skating at 40-something, pathetic.

[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.620]
I've tried to listen to him when he does the show wide you're out.

[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.860]
Have you ever tried to listen to that?

[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.160]
Some guys have talent for radio, but George ain't one of them.

[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.420]
This is definitely from Joe Bell.

[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.400]
When you work with three or a quarter of a syringe,

[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.880]
in fact, Chris, it's far more entertaining when it doesn't,

[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.660]
and it doesn't seem as though you have to pull them through the show like it seems with George.

[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.400]
I'm tired of pulling you through the show.

[00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:59.140]
I understand.

[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.440]
Like a dead weight.

[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.440]
Whereas those other guys seem to be having fun.

[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:03.740]
George brings the show down.

[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.980]
I can't wait for him to be gone.

[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.180]
I can't stand the way Joe Bell and Joyce have put a muzzle on you,

[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.620]
but Bell's decision to sack this guy is a good one.

[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.220]
Good riddance.

[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.180]
Hey, George, a tip for your next career.

[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.320]
And unseate clearly when you ask paper or plastic.

[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.560]
The fake Alejandro Sosa.

[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.340]
We'll screw you, Alejandro, picking on my buddy George.

[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.000]
You bastard.

[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.000]
You bastard.

[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:23.140]
You're a bastard.

[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.420]
But, Crippie and a negative, a nettering, a bob of negative.

[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.000]
Yeah, right.

[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:29.840]
Whatever the hell that is.

[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.340]
It's something that came up on the show years ago.

[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.160]
He's quarter of a century.

[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.180]
You got an email from somebody.

[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.320]
I think that we're never a nettering, a bob of negative.

[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.200]
I think they were calling you that.

[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.140]
We ran for a while because it was funny.

[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.280]
Oh, a long time ago.

[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:42.600]
Yeah.

[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.000]
It's not funny now.

[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:48.640]
Oh, George over there on the West Coast,

[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.440]
wherever you are.

[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.500]
George Streepie, you're a little creepy.

[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.500]
It sends me a long thing about the lawsuit between MJ,

[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.800]
Touchmit and Bubba.

[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.960]
I haven't know about you, but I'm very tired of the whole Bubba thing.

[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.380]
I never heard him.

[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:03.980]
I don't know him.

[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.900]
He got a seven-share congratulations.

[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.100]
And he kisses my ass on the ear and is trying to siphon off my audience.

[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.580]
Very transparently.

[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.140]
That's fine.

[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:11.560]
Go ahead.

[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:12.680]
It doesn't come up in my life.

[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.600]
No, that's right.

[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.460]
That's a good way to put it.

[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.060]
He doesn't.

[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.900]
He has nothing to do with my existence.

[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.980]
But if you wanted to try to siphon off this audience,

[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.280]
go ahead by kissing my ass.

[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:23.940]
Go ahead.

[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:24.780]
Go right ahead.

[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:28.100]
I'm the greatest talent in the radio business in America.

[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.100]
I would agree with that.

[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.120]
Of course, nobody knows about me because I got an agent who's like a knucklehead.

[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.140]
Knucklehead, the Kent.

[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.900]
She's a knuckle, a knuckle mistress.

[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:43.440]
Joe O'Grady says that the subject black magic is due from Friday.

[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.140]
Forget his name.

[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.580]
Friday is at a show.

[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:46.920]
A movie.

[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.560]
What is that?

[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.860]
I don't remember the, uh,

[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.400]
the Friday with a black magic.

[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.580]
He's a magic.

[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.300]
That's why grandma used to say,

[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:55.640]
magic.

[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.900]
Am I J.I.K.

[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.560]
Magic just like Mickey Mickey Mendel.

[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.480]
Mickey magic?

[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.960]
No, Mickey Mendel.

[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.600]
She was sure that Mickey Mantle was Mickey Mendel and he was Jewish.

[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.100]
She could make anybody Jewish just by changing the name around a little bit.

[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.900]
Like from you to Levitts to Solomon.

[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.060]
Just changing the name around a little bit makes you Jewish.

[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.720]
Jerry says, subject George clearly threats at George are really aimed at you.

[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:25.980]
Manage been tired of you ripping them but unable to fire you knows that firing George would annoy you.

[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.640]
I think Joe Bell wants you to leave so he could do 10 or 2.

[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.520]
Yeah, good luck to him one time as his show on.

[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.600]
He wouldn't know where to find the mic switch.

[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.380]
Although I could tell him where to look for it.

[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:37.800]
Brackdom.

[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.080]
Yeah.

[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.760]
Isn't that something about most of the people in management came from sales?

[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:43.900]
Not from programming.

[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:44.960]
Yeah, looks like from sales.

[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.620]
It's not funny.

[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.080]
Tragedy.

[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.880]
Yeah, that's one of the great tragedies in this business.

[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.600]
Most of the general managers in radio come from a sales background.

[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.380]
Not from a programming background.

[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:57.740]
That's why they're experts.

[00:38:58.460 --> 00:38:59.340]
Yeah, that makes them an expert.

[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.140]
Everybody's an expert.

[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.480]
Like my cab guy says, everybody's a big expert.

[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.320]
Oh, by the way, they were blocking the University Avenue again last night at the US Sri Lankans.

[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.540]
I'm tired of their crap.

[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.840]
Everybody in this city is tired of their crap.

[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.060]
Everybody in the world is tired of it.

[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.420]
If you want to solve it, the problems are in Sri Lankan.

[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.660]
All the people getting slaughtered over there.

[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.900]
Go back there, you terrorists.

[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.960]
That was down nine and a half points.

[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:24.900]
I mean, what kind of, I mean, I know this is a very tolerant city, but you know, tolerant to a fault.

[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.220]
You let people go out and block off the damn gardener expressway.

[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.840]
In both directions so that people are trying to get home or go downtown or whatever they're trying to do.

[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.900]
Are like stuck.

[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:42.740]
How do you like to be driving into I-95 and finders a whole bunch of goofballs standing out and sitting in the middle of the road?

[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:43.940]
No, thanks.

[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.040]
I'd floor it, I think.

[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:45.760]
Good idea.

[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.020]
I'll do people trying to drive the gardener next time they pull that crap.

[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:49.720]
Just floor it.

[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.020]
Too many damn Sri Lankans here, man.

[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.180]
Sick of their crap.

[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.660]
What's Canada going to do about their problem in Sri Lanka?

[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:00.640]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.900]
They wouldn't put up with this down there for two seconds.

[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.440]
They'd get the SWAT team out there.

[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:08.600]
They'd get the brown shirts.

[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.400]
They'd route them all up and put them in a camp.

[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.020]
They'd have another tent city down there at home.

[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:14.920]
So remember tent city?

[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:15.460]
Yeah.

[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:16.920]
Pretty tense.

[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.080]
How's Clarence doing by the way you see that clown?

[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:20.000]
And where's my bonus check?

[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.000]
I don't have any word that my bonus check's arrived yet.

[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.460]
Do you want me answer any one of those questions?

[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.500]
Yeah, whatever you want.

[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:28.740]
Clarence is doing fine.

[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:29.600]
What?

[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.080]
Clarence is doing fine.

[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.040]
As far as I know.

[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:34.160]
He's here.

[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:35.140]
He's here to win.

[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:35.700]
We're going to that start.

[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.340]
He's there today?

[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:38.840]
Yeah.

[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.320]
We'll talk about how many days I miss sick the last few months.

[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:43.820]
My God.

[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.580]
Here's the guy.

[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:45.480]
Is he over there?

[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.760]
Every time the canes go out there and SWAT,

[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.920]
they have batting practice.

[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:49.900]
He takes the day off.

[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.460]
Clarence won't be in today.

[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.380]
The canes are taken a shower.

[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.480]
The canes are you.

[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:56.900]
Probably taken a shower with him.

[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.620]
I wonder if his wife knows that he just married.

[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.420]
He takes showers naked with the ball players.

[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:04.920]
Do you think she knows that?

[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:05.660]
Probably.

[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:11.020]
Mike says, I love your show, but I really think Waxie's got some competition for you now.

[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:11.580]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.100]
They're not syndicating ESPN sports dogs show host the herd.

[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.180]
The host is pretty good and has a following.

[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:17.460]
Yeah.

[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.420]
Mike Cowpile.

[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.100]
Or whatever his name is.

[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.300]
Clem Clik, a little hopper.

[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:22.960]
Yeah.

[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.420]
Now they got some stiff competition.

[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.280]
Underline stiff.

[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.160]
Mike Swanson.

[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.540]
Who obviously is it making TV dinners across the street?

[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.140]
They got some real competition.

[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.600]
Basically they threw it in the towel.

[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.820]
They've given up on midday.

[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.660]
They won't put a paid person in there.

[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:40.300]
When you put a syndicated piece of turd like Clem Cowpile on,

[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.280]
you know you've given up.

[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:42.140]
Yep.

[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.640]
And if I was them, I'd give up too.

[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.840]
After what, three years now, two and a half, three years or whatever they've been on.

[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.200]
Force feeding.

[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:49.920]
Oh.

[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.420]
Shares down the down the pipe.

[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:51.700]
Oh.

[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.900]
All they got is Le Bastard.

[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.720]
And his number is dwindling rapidly anyway.

[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.760]
Dwindling, dwindling, dwindling, dwindling.

[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.080]
Sue Wheat dwindling.

[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.200]
I told you, I heard him for about five or ten minutes last time I was down here.

[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:08.560]
And I just, juvenile and sophomore is an understatement if it's a compliment.

[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.180]
A good friend can up the road in the Tobacosis.

[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.740]
I would recommend spinal decompression as treatment for lower back pain.

[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:18.620]
Now I kind of enjoy my lower back pain.

[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.160]
And all I do is when I, like when I stand up, yeah, it's all those things.

[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:22.540]
When it goes away, you miss it.

[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.380]
Spinal decompression.

[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:29.520]
This is done by a physiotherapist over a short time, a period of time is really effective.

[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.900]
A machine like a bed where you lie in your back, the top part of your lower body,

[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.360]
and the lower part are strapped.

[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:42.660]
And the bed opens, taking pressure off your spine, kind of like in the hitcher.

[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.120]
Yeah, they stretch you.

[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:47.040]
They sort of have to say they stretch you like putting you on a rack.

[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:50.060]
Although I've heard good things from people that have the back pain.

[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:53.200]
Spinal decompression, it says my treatment lies to 20 minutes per session.

[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.660]
Well, thanks, Ken.

[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:55.680]
They stretch you out.

[00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.840]
I think I'll do a psychological healing myself rather than go through that.

[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.680]
That doesn't sound good.

[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:03.920]
Lower back.

[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:06.680]
I had this back a few years ago down there.

[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.740]
Remember I was going to the chiropractor isn't that they were smearing my back and whatever?

[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:10.600]
In plantation.

[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:11.760]
Remember that?

[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:12.540]
Right.

[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.000]
Do you?

[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:14.900]
Yep.

[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.320]
And I'll be damned.

[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.420]
Well, here's a poll.

[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.460]
The 10 reasons I've listened to your show for years and years.

[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.220]
Okay, great.

[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:28.780]
The black magic in the movie Friday is the same one in bad Santa.

[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.440]
Well, that's great, but I don't know who it is.

[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:32.700]
Maybe you can Google it.

[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.280]
I have bad Santa either.

[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:35.500]
You what?

[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.120]
I didn't see bad Santa either.

[00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:38.840]
Oh, me neither.

[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:45.840]
Oh, Paul Castron over writes, and I'm sure it's the real one.

[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:51.620]
By the way, it's got all the all the stuff there with their numbers and their emails and their, you know, a link.

[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.260]
Phob is only numbers 18 to 34.

[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.580]
He's full of it listening to George last week.

[00:43:56.580 --> 00:44:01.060]
He said he taught at the Connecticut School of Broadcasting and search joke here.

[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:02.820]
What does that mean?

[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.760]
You taught at the Connecticut School of Broadcasting.

[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:05.140]
Yeah.

[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.920]
When was that years ago?

[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:09.680]
Must have been behind my back.

[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.300]
I remember that.

[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:11.180]
I told you about it.

[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.720]
You just didn't listen or forgot about it.

[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.700]
Yeah, and I did you have to get drunk to teach it was that part of the thing?

[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.760]
You didn't have to, but it was encouraged.

[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.620]
Paul Castron over from the Paul and ancient Ron show have a hectic day.

[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:24.920]
Yeah.

[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:26.460]
Good luck to you, Paul.

[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.380]
They kicked some big ass in his last book.

[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:31.360]
I mean, I hate to say it.

[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.840]
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but they kicked some big.

[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.880]
Well, here we go again.

[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:37.700]
Unoriginal ass.

[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.260]
This is the Neil Roger show.

[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.960]
What what what solid?

[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.060]
This is your brain.

[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.960]
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no.

[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.000]
Any questions?

[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.740]
Real American A-holes.

[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.000]
Real American A-holes.

[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.280]
We salute you.

[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:59.520]

Mr. Public Restroom toilet tissue dispensary filler guy.

[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:04.640]
I'm the food chain of life.

[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.060]
You are an amoebaugh.

[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:13.580]
Even the caught return guy mocks you as you head to the supply room to stock up

[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:20.060]
While your peers acquire their job skills at the local community college

[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:26.680]
You learned everything you've ever needed to know in that rancid turlid at the corner gas station

[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:35.000]
When you take your work home with you it usually involves some sort of nasty rash

[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.820]
You don't get hit but there's a certain satisfaction

[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:44.480]
To come into the rescue of an IBS sufferer on taco day

[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:55.120]
So we salute you mr. Public Restroom toilet tissue dispensary filler guy your plunger your land yard and your

1103 at 560 WQM happy Tuesday too. You know, I haven't even given the poll and it's already the second hour of the show

[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:14.980]
Well then that's your fault. I know quit being a nattering a nae Bob of negativity right and dead weight or whatever else

[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:20.260]
Schedule is this Orlando 2 to 4 mad dog is at shulas today 4 to 7 and then after that everybody goes away

[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:26.120]
Dolphin tonight 7 to wait with the the wooden Kimba Bulkamper and 8 to 11 DA with his oh numbers

[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:32.160]
Then ESPN radio which I guess I don't know we're simile casting with across the street is that true or is that somebody make that up?

[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.700]
Why not we practically are anyway

[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:40.920]
You're bad. How about those black Hawks huh? How about Jonathan Taves in the Patrick came oh

[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.880]
Baby Patrick King and I take a shower with him any day

[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.040]
I bet she can run real fast though, you know

[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:55.020]
Here's the poll the biggest burden I'm dealing with right now is worrying about George losing his job is winning this poll 46

[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:55.840]
How do you like that?

[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.460]
That's what I voted for

[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.300]
Did you vote? I worried about losing my own

[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:07.760]
My job stability 45. Yeah, that's the one I voted. Oh, well same thing in your case

[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.840]
I'm not worried about anything 35 all brother

[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:18.140]
My health 34 I can't pay my bills 33 my relationship status 32 trying to fight a job 29

[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.700]
How the dolphins are gonna do this year 15? Oh, brother

[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:28.840]
No health insurance 13 paying for my kids college to wish nate my card doesn't run three. I'm losing my home to

[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:34.400]
Two people in the audience are losing their home. I think George will be right over and take care of the

[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.020]
mortgage payments right y'all up to snuff right I got it right in

[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:46.540]
This whole business is so ugly and so unnecessary and so grotesque and of course as usual being handled so poorly

[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:49.080]
and

[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:55.400]
And the only reason they're doing it this way is because they can't just directly come and say George you're fired because they know it violates the terms of my contract

[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:56.420]
right

[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:01.180]
They would love. I'm sure to come in there and say hey, here's flea

[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:08.720]
They're trying to inflict the flea on me and nothing nothing personal. I like him just fine. I think he's full of crap

[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:15.500]
How could they be planning on giving him your job and they haven't talked to him about it find out how much money

[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:19.820]
He wants to do it and so on. I don't want to call him a liar, but I think he's a full of crap

[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:26.260]
He's too tight with jolly joe for them to do it that way. Why would they have to do it that way?

[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.240]
I don't know wouldn't you think they would run it by him before they would just say well

[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:35.360]
You know, we want to put it flea in there. He's a lot better on the year than that damn nattering nabob of negativity George

[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:43.100]
You know as I get older. I've got a shaving problem do you and you know what it is your head? No, no

[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.500]
The corners of my upper lip

[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:46.880]
Okay

[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:51.280]
And it's annoying because once you realize that you haven't completely

[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:55.280]
Eliminated all the hair from that those spots and you start

[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.380]
Tunguing it right you know I mean yep

[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:03.400]
And you realize it's still there then then you got then I got to take a break and run another room and get my razor and just you know

[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.360]
Now you got me doing it what?

[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.060]
Tunguing it and what have you ever had that problem in the corners of your upper lip?

[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.140]
Just this morning

[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.360]
Seriously, seriously

[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:18.400]
I thought this was a poll from Barry and Coral Springs, but it's not it's just his top ten list

[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:23.960]
The ten reasons I've listened to your show for years and years number one. It's free number two

[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.280]

Eight-year-old bit heavy George's slim nine-year-old Yiddish George no Spanish and ten when I turn up to fight him

[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.600]
My wife leaves the room. Thank God

[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:47.000]
Well score her well or not is the case may be Barry

Alex Keras may still be alive but Leo the rocher is long since dead

[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.220]
Who was he married to Leo the rocher some actress?

[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:16.320]
Uh for crying out loud somebody oh the lip who somebody will call and tell you yes. No, somebody will email

[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:21.000]
Don't give me that somebody will call and tell me crap the calls are

[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:26.020]
If you have any idea how how many years this is added to my life getting rid of those phone calls

[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:33.540]
Nance says can we just leave and see this is what cracks me up like I've got some control over it

[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:37.460]
Can we just leave your show the great way it is yeah, that would be fine, Nan

[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:42.280]
You and George have become a team after all these years George has come a long way and you'll you're the best

[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:53.520]
And I hope we can just leave the show the way it is they've already devolved enough more than enough

[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.800]
The thousand eighty six cent

[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:03.820]
Here's one that says pack George a Cuban sandwich and send him far away. That's bad

[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.640]
I haven't made my bacon yet this morning

[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:11.420]
During this next break I'm going to go make him bacon. Okay. That's your fault. I don't

[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:18.980]
It says the facts are that George has no talent has been writing your back for close to 20 years now

[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:23.460]
He's one dimensional talks about the same crap every time drugs and his sex fantasies

[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:30.160]
How about you don't talk about Patrick Kane. That's my sex fantasy. Oh, hmm go hawks go baby

[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.960]
God is he beautiful pretty boy

[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:38.120]
Without your support and friendship and he probably would be working at Taco Bell at Burger King

[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.040]
You would be working at Taco Bell with you

[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:47.960]
Maybe taco smell oh and guess where guess what restaurant is gotten spanked for using more salt than any other restaurant chain

[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:52.300]
And they were talking about how much salt that they put in their food red blopster

[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.980]
Just a disgusting nauseating amount

[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.300]
already then

[00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:03.600]
Anyway, it says you have been his lifesaver and like a 20 year old kid that won't leave his parents home because he can't make it on his own in the real world

[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:09.740]
Now it's time for George to leave the nest his easy money days are over bring on flee and let's see how much better your ratings will get

[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:11.660]
Don't go away mad George just go away

[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:15.420]
Maybe you can do a show with Mohawar David and Gellie. This is definitely from um

[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:16.800]
joebell

[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:19.880]
You

[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.860]
Packed George a Cuban sandwich and sent him far away. You're good friend joebell

[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:27.640]
See normal things that you've done something to piss them off and that it's personal and they hate you like poison now

[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:33.140]
Yeah, that could very well be well well what would that have been uh talk about how all their decisions suck on the air

[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:38.860]
For the face of their programming it lied well, we all know that continue to prove how backwards their programming principles are

[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:41.480]
Yeah, I don't know. Mm-hmm. Just guessing

[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:41.580]
Yeah

[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.780]
No, it would have to be something more devastating than I would think

[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:52.140]
I mean, that's just you know that's that's something everybody knows right

[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.300]
They're proven commodity a failure

[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:58.500]
How's that kinean blow morning show doing they still blowing oh, it's great

[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:03.740]
The answer my friend is blowing in the wind the kinean blow morning show they're doing it

[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.720]
The douse down to an aff point. It's not doing much today

[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:13.140]
Three thousand acres are burning in florida and martin county look at those fires look at that smoke

[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:18.480]
And look at the number of emails pouring in here

[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:26.260]
Here's one that says do you really think joebell would pay flee extra money to produce your show? I don't know

[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:29.200]
I don't know. I don't know if we would do it for free. I know flee is a flunky

[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.200]
But I don't know do you think he would do it for free? I don't

[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:34.460]
No

[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:36.800]
But I don't know

[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.360]
Here's one that says I'm a listener of the near rarger show

[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.380]
But I won't be when you put on tapes during meals days off

[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:46.280]
George is interesting and compelling host you're compelling

[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:50.480]
I hope that you don't terminate George Rodriguez's employment. Why are they sending this to me?

[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:54.840]
Maybe it's a copy if anything you should be given a two-hour slot to do his own show

[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.160]
Have him take big O's slot. He would get bigger numbers

[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:02.860]
Get rid of George Rodriguez would be a bad business decision. I'm not some crank. I have a job a wife in life

[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:03.800]
Thank you Avi

[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.000]
Obviously in that I guess he must have sent that to jolly joe

Oh, no

[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:34.100]
A Roman Catholic archbishop who resigned in 2002 over a sex and financial scandal involving a man

The scribes his struggles with being gay and enough coming memoir about his decades serving the church

[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:43.040]

[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:36.500]
Tonight so this tonight investigates Susan Boyle the boy old backlash why there's growing outrage over her makeover tonight

[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.920]
Everybody is buzzing about her new look

[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:44.580]
You're trying to look like Beyonce for having a she got life-host suction and breast implants and a spray tan

[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:48.040]
When we first met her she told the world she wasn't exactly

[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:54.700]
Experience in the ways of love, but that whole never been kissed thing wasn't exactly true

[00:55:54.700 --> 00:56:02.000]
Susan I will just teenagers we did behind the bond she got Randy with one of the sheep

[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:05.540]
I think she's the one that started swine flu

[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:11.520]
If that's not all a brand new video Susan Boyle as a stripper what

[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:18.520]
This is so this tonight on hln. Oh, she's got a big unit, huh?

[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.040]
Susan Boyle wouldn't surprise me in the least bit a big boy

[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:25.300]
One thing that's really good about her that is we don't hear about her anymore

[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:29.260]
Thank God and we don't hear about swine flu at all at all

[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:32.820]
Oh here we go carry a pre-jean

[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:38.620]
Uh, you confided in me that they have a whole celebration. Yeah, I said it wrong too. Miss California

[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:44.100]
I want to thank my mom and dad. Yeah, it's my my straight family who are here with me today. My straight parents

[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.600]
Um, and my sister she is serving in the United States Air Force

[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:52.580]
I just shoot the bitch already and get it over with for Christ. There we go

[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:53.380]
God

[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.920]
She's the she's the female version of Joe the plumber. Yeah

[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:05.560]
Oh, here we go the phantom informer is back as if let me let me just say this to you. Okay. I mean I may be slow old stupid

[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:14.760]
But people don't hire people in this business by way of some anonymous jackass ass clown with an email named the phantom informer

[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.040]
Okay, right subject clear channel Orlando

[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:20.100]

I will give you some free advice get a new agent clear channel or you lowlando as yet to hear from norm

[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.220]
They are serious about this if you are please contact Linda Burger Katherine Brown today. Yeah

[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.200]
That's the way that they do it

[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:35.040]
That's the way that they inquire to see if people want to silence cast their show is they have some geek

[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:40.400]
Who identifies himself as the phantom informer who isn't even the real phantom informer on an email

[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:43.120]
Anonymous email and that's how they contact you

[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.200]
I spoke to normal last night. He hasn't heard from anybody nor is he going to

[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.700]
Nor is he going to get stuck into making anymore

[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:52.200]
Stupid calls. I'm looking like a bigger jackass than he already is

[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:57.220]
No comment now. He's going to bad for you. He sent a letter on his letterhead

[00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:58.380]
Well then

[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:01.920]
Yeah, you can't get much more serious than that. I guess not

[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.080]
The douse down a point and a half

[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.940]
And miss California's blah blah blah blah blah blah

[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.160]
The hateful one man and one woman

[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:15.900]
Pickable rumors and false allegations. I have had within the last three weeks. Right stripper bitch slut

[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:20.140]
But he she's kind of like Sarah Palin. You know a very family-oriented

[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:25.160]
Right with the illegitimate the grandson or granddaughter whatever it is

[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:32.840]
Kennet says please ask George what song he was playing when you temporarily stepped away ten minutes ago when I went to shave my lip

[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:35.160]
Keep a stiff upper lip guys

[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.520]
All night we plan all night is it all night

[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.780]
Don't stop in parentheses by Janet

[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.640]
By what Janet?

[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.540]
Janet Janet

[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:49.320]
Does Janet have a last name or just by Janet? That's it Janet. I see

[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:53.560]
Janet the

[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:57.440]
Sandra Clinton bird mix if you want to get technical about wow

[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.200]
Next thing you know we've claimed to rude and

[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:07.100]
Sand what was the name of that sand storm? What was it sandstorm? That's what I just said

[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.420]
If you got it and you want to play it I got it here somewhere

[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.020]
But I'm not going to dig it out. I don't like the rude

[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:17.780]
Tandana and I and I it's the same yeah here we go

[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:19.600]
Yes, this is

[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:23.680]
No, but I'm saying it's just the same four notes over and over hold

[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:29.080]
There we go. How did there's anything wrong with that? No, there's nothing wrong with it. It's okay. Just fine

[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:47.820]
Yeah

[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:56.840]
The biggest burden that I have and dealing with right now is my job stability 53

[00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:01.260]
Worrying about George losing his job 52. How do you like that? That's very sweet

[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:06.600]
We always stop the audience where a bunch of hardasses and most of them are but nevertheless they're worried about your job. That's good

[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:12.440]
They're finally convinced I guess after seeing Tom jikas a column that this isn't some kind of a stick

[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.420]
What that just bugs the crap out of both of us

[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:20.540]
Frost our ass when people come up with her. Oh, yeah, I guess you got no materials. So you made up a sir

[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.900]
We don't we don't make up crap on a show like that. Okay

[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:29.420]
It's not like the old first team were defos and rehab and Vegas. No, nobody ever went on vacation on that show

[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:32.380]
They always had some kind of personal emergency or trauma

[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:41.400]
There was always contrived and made up and a big fat stupid lie and people like Kenny from Borershead and the Mark the Jets fan and those other

[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.440]
Trigletites they would believe that crap

[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:48.220]
Oh, who did I hear Joe talking to this morning?

[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:56.800]
The Hany and Joe or some Jamaican Joe. I don't know one of those long time chronics boy

[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.880]
Although I didn't hear what's his name on their storm cat

[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.540]
Thank God

[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.080]
It's right here storm me again. I'm gonna kill somebody

[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:12.500]
Chikasha Oklahoma sounds like a really neat place almost is almost as exciting as pohoki

[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:16.520]
That's another thing that kept talking about this morning pohoki this and pohki that

[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.820]
You ever been in pohoki? I must have been or okitobi. Yeah, I've been all over

[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:28.800]
I didn't have school football games. I brought cast and when I was a JNO in pohoki and okitobi

[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.600]
You talk about Yehu man you talk about red neck

[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.640]
You're gonna love that cherry pie. It's only been refrozen about 45 times

[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:44.520]
At the pohoki diner that was the only place in town to eat of course that's a long time about 3 to 4 years ago

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:48.000]
They might even have an a and w drive through there now in pohoki

[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:52.440]
Or Mickey D's a Mickey D's with a new uh

[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:57.100]
Chetter and bacon anna oh and I never made my bacon the anus burger doing this upcoming break

[01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:00.720]
I'm gonna make my bacon don't let me forget all right. I won't make the bacon you fat old fag

[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.360]
Text you

[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.980]
No, you won't. Don't be testing me about making bacon

[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:11.920]
The bizarre arrest of a man selling ice cream now has police car-sling parents not to let their children buy treats alone

[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.860]
He looked me up and down brandy hove said it was creepy. It was really creepy. This is an Chikasha Oklahoma

[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:21.940]
It's not what you'd expect when you walk up to an any ice cream truck

[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:26.320]
But hove says she and her two young children got more than ice cream when the tar stop in front of their home

[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.960]
It was eerie really eerie

[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:33.500]
First she said it was creepy really creepy now. She says it was eerie really eerie

[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.960]
She says everything twice

[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:40.320]
He stared at me as first as I walked up and looked down at them and didn't take his eyes off in the whole time

[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.620]
Hogue said I wonder if she's a kind of Benoit Hogue

[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.100]
The frog hockey player

[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.340]
Benoit Ball

[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:53.140]
It was enough to prompt hove to call police authority stopped the vehicle not far from her home and made a strange discovery

[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:58.740]
After searching the pasture in the ice cream truck officers found marijuana in one pocket and three condoms in the other demands

Rosie she had a lot. Yes, you'll probably have something to say about this

[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.520]
Harry you are a carry your role model for young girls that were over here. Hi

[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:19.000]
Your role model for young girls and whether or not the pictures were taken for applications as you said or publication

[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:25.760]
The fact is these pictures existed and they've made their way out there pictures that you say didn't exist and to some young girls

[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.440]
It may make you look like a liar so my question is

[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:35.680]
What does that say about being a role model to young girls if it if the Peter line and your game is to be dishonest

[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:41.380]
Well, by the way, I wonder I think it's a very unfair question. There's no dishonesty there

[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.100]
I think it's a very unfair question

[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:48.780]
There's no dishonesty there and these pictures. I mean I looked at the pictures and you all the pictures

[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.420]
And these were not pictures like you're talking about you know

[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:57.380]
We had to terminate somebody a year ago and if you want to see pictures, I'd show you pictures

[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:02.080]
So you know you can't talk about the dishonesty. Okay, go ahead. Thank you. Go ahead

[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.700]
Who answered you had a question? Yeah question

[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:11.740]
What

[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:17.440]
First of all these yeah, we had somebody's shouting from way at the back of their from another room

[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:25.840]
You know one of the things that happened upstairs in mr. Trump's office is that we actually got to sit down face to face and

[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:31.200]
We got to talk and she got to then and I got to then and and I think something very positive has come out of it

[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:36.060]
Right now, who cares who gives a crap mr. California keeps her crown

[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.460]
The only reason you care is because you want to go down

[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:49.240]
Okay, without a crowd don't like her. I've been talking you don't like her mr. California. Yeah, she's a bigoted bitch

[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:52.740]
Well, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about you know. Oh, yeah, I do her once

[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:55.560]

[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.920]
Michael says George's fascination with house music is very very sad

[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:21.400]
He needs to act his age is he gonna grow a ponytail next. He's a man child and sucks on the ear

[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:26.760]
This is the first good decision jobel has made in a long time says Michael Phelps. Oh, yeah

[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:29.320]
Michael Phelps

[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:34.480]
We all we all know that the fake Michael Phelps is jobel. We already know that right from the beginning right?

[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:39.620]
Here's one that says George should not leave. I like his content

[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:42.760]
Yes, I blasted him for his poor choice of music and

[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:48.620]
Leg injuries while skating with 12-year-old kids, but through all that George is my number two guy in your station says Sam

[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:54.900]
I wonder if his constant hatred of sports talk just made a wedge between I blasted him for his poor choice of music and

[01:09:54.900 --> 01:10:00.880]
Leg injuries while skating with 12-year-old kids, but through all that George is my number two guy in your station says Sam

[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.800]
I wonder if his constant hatred of sports talk just made a wedge between him and his co-workers

[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.140]
If I treated my co-workers as garbage and demeaned them daily

[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:13.500]
told him that they worked sucked in his worthless. They might not see me as a team player since Sam

[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:19.740]
Did you tell him that they they worked sucked in that they were working on great with my co-workers last time I checked everybody likes George

[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.100]
Don't ask me why but I mean, you know

[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.100]
LeBazard was criticizing you for making fun and grilling management on the air all the time

[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:34.200]

[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:55.440]

Four to seven over there across the street. By the way, he said he will not take the job for free

[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.460]
Oh flea flea don't work for free. I'm sure that

[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:09.160]
So that being the case how could there have been no

[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:15.980]
Communication about this if jolly Joe thinks he's ready to stick him in there if I would have said okay, let's fire George. Let's go ahead. Go ahead

[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:26.760]
He would have stuck the flea in there now. How can he do that without discussing with him? How much more do you want to do that crap to work with that fat old bag in every day?

[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.460]
So let's so what do you say?

[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:32.160]
I don't know

[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.180]

Oh, here you go the phantom informer is bad you people are so damn bad. This sounds like roby young doesn't it?

[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:06.240]
It's a quote you people are so damn bad you can't even call people back. You want to do business with you

[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:10.740]
I never claimed to be a clear channel employee. I buy time and influence people who buy time

[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:17.300]
Robo young is emailing from the other side if you people can't get it together

[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:21.580]
I suggest you take your damn frequency turn it off and get out of the business you people ought to be ashamed

[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:25.920]
You have no credibility in radio from the phantom informer the dead roby young

[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.340]
Is that a beautiful thing or what?

[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.160]
Yeah, that's just a way of saying I'm a fake in a phony and it's all a bunch of crap

[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:39.400]
We already figured that out. I'm a little slow, but not that slow old and believe me well that old

[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:45.840]
That's my best advice on you people out there all you people under the age of like say, I don't know what 50 don't get old yet

[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:52.960]

You people are certain

[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:01.600]
So damn bad it not only you have to be brought up by that bandit passion

That's 75 uh, yeah, sorry, you don't have it on your regular number

[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.720]
I was asked to be a guest on one of your truck shows or an I think it's your AM the WIOD

[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.820]
They won't even call me back to tell me what the name of the show is

[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.740]
My work on your station in

[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:20.680]

[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:23.500]
You're the prominent guy Miami

[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:29.780]
But by time and I influenced people who buy time if you people can't get it together to be a better radio station

[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:33.460]
Then if you were to come or ask station or an EBS station

[01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:39.900]
I said you take a damn frequency which my grandmother's friend Jesse Jay put on here in 1926

[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:45.120]
He has turned the damn thing off and get out of the business you people ought to be exchange to yourselves

You shouldn't even be running that facility. I used to be the boss of the damn thing in 19

[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:03.120]

If the sale goes through better will because you're doing anyhow

[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:18.620]
Wow

[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:26.900]
The angry dead roby young 77 wabc he worked there a thousand years ago roby I heard this

[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:31.240]
He had some issues you know what I'm saying one of them being the gay but other than that

[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:35.740]
I had some real interesting roby young stories

[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.860]
Yeah, I don't know that I can't tell on the year. I say even though he's dead. I still I just wouldn't do it all right

[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:47.720]
He was a phenoma young phenoma wabc disjocke and then his whole life went in the crapper, you know

[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:51.460]
I wonder if that had anything to do with coming to south florida maybe

[01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:00.540]
Mike says one of the many reasons George needs to stay is because he attends ultra and knows who dead mouse five dead mouse and sander

[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:02.840]

I think that alone earns you a whole bunch of brownie points. Well, thanks

[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:29.460]
I think joe bill things you you earned a whole bunch of demerits when you ripped them and asked and said that he was an ass clown or whatever

[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:30.120]
You said about him

[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.540]
Or was that clearance said that about joe bill? I don't I think flea is the one that said it

[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.720]
Flea said he's a big fat ass clown

[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:42.400]
The only thing I would take exception of that is that clowns generally tend to be funny

[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.980]
I don't find anything funny about jolly joe bill

[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:50.540]
Kevin and my mispronies as I was so sorry to hear on your show Monday that appears George will be fired

[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:55.320]
Please give him my support. Hey, you got Kevin support my mispronies George. Thanks. I'll love throughout on the pile

[01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:00.080]
You were also hitting on the show you want Norma Kenteko after QM and visley broadcasting for breach of contract

[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.740]
You definitely should have normal file of breach of contract suit

[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:08.760]
In my opinion if Norma fails to do this on your behalf you should fire him and go get a lawyer with cajonis who will

[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.980]
Well, Norm don't have cajonis

[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.080]
He likes cajonis, but he don't have any

[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:18.780]
Maybe he's out picking up a stray homeless right now

[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:26.380]
Todd and hollywood says how can this be is this really happening George gets the Isaac Hayes question mark

[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:30.240]
Are these people you work for idiots? It sucks that they should happen to him

[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:36.120]
I don't know George, but my kids and I used to hang out at the school stop with his wife and eldest daughter was middle school at the time

[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.560]
I thought they were terrific people

[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:41.760]
They used to hang out at the school bus stop

[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:47.080]
Yeah, well, what does that mean? I didn't take it was confusing

[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:55.060]
But I like George on the radio he's at least alive most of the time anybody who doesn't like him can kiss my fat cottage cheese as keep George spray flee

[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.160]
spray the flee

[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.960]
How about if we bring in the mosquito

[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:08.000]
Okay, what do you think the fleet don't seem to be cutting it on the shore at least as a replacement

[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:10.640]
How about the mosquito

[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.380]
Yeah, the mosquito makes some strange sounds

[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:20.800]
So fleece that he ain't going to do your job for free, huh

[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:25.380]
No flee for free. So he said my homies has even offered asking that

[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:30.480]
Okay, but he won't tell you because he's lying about it. He lied yesterday when I you know

[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:35.180]
I give him credit for coming in there, but um, you know, that's a good cover-up

[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:38.560]
I

[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.600]
Mean I like him just fine, you know, you know that I am

[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:41.900]
fond of him

[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:47.220]
Not that fun, but I mean I like him personally. He's okay. Good guy done a lot of stuff for this show

[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:52.640]
He's done stuff that our program director in name has never even dreamed about doing including on our website

[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.080]
But nevertheless

[01:17:57.060 --> 01:18:03.920]
Oh, here's one it says let's talk more let's talk more sports forget about talking about important issues of life and death when there's sports stuff to talk about

[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.920]
Long live storm cat the show killer

[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:11.820]
Show killer doesn't even come close to describing it now. That's that's a good

[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:16.260]
Pull question who's the biggest show killer on the sports shows

[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:20.640]
Of course one of the choices would be don't listen to the sports shows

[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.560]
But like a Ira Winbag

[01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:24.500]
Alex Marvez

[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.120]
Yeah, Drew Rosenstein house grants Schwartzburg

[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.080]
Steen

[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:37.160]
There's a list of them and they keep bringing them back and back and back they've even

[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:39.700]
Settled on the poor mad dog with Ira Winbag

[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:44.740]
I guess mad dog is just you know, he must be like me old and feeble now, you know

[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:47.740]
Because back in the day he wouldn't tolerate that kind of crap because he hates guests

[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:49.500]
He doesn't believe in guests and he's right about that

[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:52.680]
He's absolutely correct about guests most of mara two-node

[01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:58.980]
If I'm gonna have a guy coming on here talking about old baseball cards for two hours and I announced it ahead of time

[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:02.220]
99 and 910s percent of the audience are not gonna be tuning in

[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:07.060]
Because 99 and 999 they they don't care about it

[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:14.380]
No matter how many baseball cards shows some talk show hosts might go to the audience doesn't give a flying crap about it

[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:18.560]
Do you give a crap about it? Oh, yeah, I listened to everyone. I'm riveted

[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.940]
Here's one from Jorge and Miami who says about you typical leftist punk

[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:27.600]
George calls Miss California a bigot just because he doesn't agree with her

[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:32.380]
What happened to freedom what happened to freedom speech? Yeah, I'm glad he's getting fired. It's his Jorge and Miami

[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:34.960]
Not so fast Jorge. I mean he's not going anywhere

[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:40.060]
Norma can't is sending a letter maybe already sent it emailed it sent it

[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:46.100]
snail mail put it in a bottle on on his legal letterhead to jolly joebell saying no way Jorge

[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:49.800]
So Jorge and Miami blow it out. You're right wing ass

[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:54.440]
You got some nerve pick it on miss California George everybody's because

[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:58.460]
Is he's a bigoted bitch. I'm not giving her a hard time for stating her honest opinion

[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:04.600]
She's a bigot. Yeah, that's her honest opinion. That's fine. She stated it right, you know if it clansman gets up

[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:08.120]
He's got a right to say he's a bigot. That's correct if a clansman gets up and says you know

[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.480]
Black children shouldn't swim in the swimming pool with white children

[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:14.140]
That could be his honest opinion and and he's still a bigot right

[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:21.940]
What happened to freedom speech now freedom of speech you're an idiot Jorge you're free to express all the bigot of opinions that you want

[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:23.580]
I'm free to call you a bigot right

[01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:28.820]
creepy George streepy in Orlando who's chronic and the sirens are coming again you hear him no

[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:32.780]
Can't hear that I do now

[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:41.780]
Fleet brought up a good point yesterday says George just how much could George be making that would adversely affect the bottom line of a number one show on a heritage large market station

[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:42.560]
That's correct

[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:46.480]
That's correct George, but you don't understand what's going on in today's economy

[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:54.140]
Everywhere you look they're slicing and dicing and chopping and cutting and everybody's getting screwed everybody's getting stabbed whether it makes a difference or not

[01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:59.520]
Because there's some people who enjoy like ruining everybody's life and that's what I think part of this is all about

[01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:07.280]
I say all you employers out there no matter what the business is fire everybody you're fired

[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:16.080]
Yeah, and what's Trump doing on there with Miss California? What's that all about he runs the uh the miss something or other does he really

[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.160]
Miss America something he bought that he still got that same haircut by the way

[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.520]
God with his money still can't get afford a haircut same come over oh my god

[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:27.300]
He looks like hell on wheels. He makes me look like freaking Patrick Kane

[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:28.760]
God how I wish

[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.580]
If I look like Patrick Kane I got news for I wouldn't be busy enough to be playing

[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:36.240]
I'd be too busy to be playing hockey or doing the show. I'd be I'd be out and about

[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:37.540]
Oot and a boot

[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:43.940]
I sure hope those damn Sri Lankans aren't blocking the streets again here today sick and tear their crap

[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:50.780]
I mean let's face it if you had if you had some big problem going on in your native country like Cuba for example

[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:56.020]
Would you come to Canada and demand that the Canadian government do something about it and if that didn't work

[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:59.200]
I'd go to Nova Scotia right that's where well that's Canada. I'm sorry

[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:03.120]
You better get your Canadian geography straight mystery. You're gonna wind up on the street

[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:08.420]
Sorry, is that the place that's a half hour off from everyone? Yeah, the hour and a half faster. They're an hour and a half ahead

[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.260]
Way way over there way east

[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:15.920]
P.E.I. Prince Edward Island. I think that's where Wally Hennessey is from hey

[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:18.360]

[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:55.480]

PDF. Oh, no, it's Adobe. I can read that

[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.700]
It's from joebel

[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:24.740]
Oh, no, it's two joebel. This is the one. This is the one we already knew about

[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:31.920]
Neil has reviewed your request to substitute another host for Georgia's as producer while sympathetic to the financial matters

[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:38.940]
You enumerated he declines you'll simply request that the longtime continuity of the show be protected and asked the WQM honored Georgia's contract

[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:40.980]
And it's entirely sincerely norma can't

[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:49.680]
How do you like that? That was on my Adobe reader. I was able to open it as opposed to usually the crap that they send me which I can't open

[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:55.860]
And all that Microsoft crap. Boy there's a lot of emails coming in today. They're pretty pumped up about all this crap

[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:01.240]
Neil, please keep boy George. Oh, this is from stoke broker Rick

[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.820]
Any shot at the prechtice promotion. Yeah, you send me this idiotic crap before anyone gonna be no pre pre-prechtice promotion with caps and hats etc

[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.660]
Here's one from oishmoy Jew

[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:19.580]
Says welcome back George. Oh, I don't think anybody changed any mind yet. We just got normal cants

[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:23.560]
moderate email moderately adamant

[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:28.600]
Why did joebel change his mind about George? He does really have a heart Neil threatened to bail

[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:32.860]
Georgia's wife put out and saved his job. Do I show it him her goods and told him to choose?

[01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:34.040]
Etc etc

[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:37.400]
Welcome back George. Well, welcome back from what?

[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:40.780]
I didn't know I went anywhere

[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.860]
Did you go somewhere? Yeah, Uranus

[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.140]
And now I'm back

[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:53.460]
A poem from Baron Fitz the worst poem in history

[01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:58.520]
He'll show us have to George's balls are bruised. Fjurebell is a fat loser hates Cubans and Jews

[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:06.340]
Oh, you like that one, huh? Cute it rhymed from from Mosh Mendrick or whatever his name is

[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:09.460]
It rhymes

[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.620]
Here's one from Keith

[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:20.140]
Let's talk about talent here. Listen to George's voice. It's not yours. It is naturally smooth and has a soothing tone to it

[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:24.320]
He has the ability to be diverse and change his tone singing or talking

[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:26.360]
flees voice sounds just plain

[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.260]
plain and soft

[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.880]
Like and like a school girl

[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:39.000]
There's no talent behind it when I hear flea do a commercial it sounds plain ridiculous George equals talent

[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:44.880]
Flea equals talentless says Keith. How do you like that? I shot at your friend tree

[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:51.100]
To Steve Goldstein but you can call me Kelsey whenever I'm in town. I listen to wait a minute. I am in town

[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:52.900]
It's the 12th of one hour

[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:02.440]
Moe, how did David go to the room? I am here and you are

[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.060]

[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:35.020]
This is a sports show and nothing else absolutely nothing exists outside the gay world of sports

[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:38.740]
Yeah, by the way some they paid me to oggle and admit me

[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:43.040]
This here is a show for men about men like this

[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:50.440]
Millie bears and chaps you stole the pizza. Huh? You stole the pizza. I did not take no pizza

[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.540]
The pizza I don't be ridiculous

[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:56.600]
You stole the pizza. I don't know what you're talking about

[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:01.340]
I stole the pizza. I didn't steal more pizza. I stole the pizza

[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:05.700]
I did not steal no pizza. I stole the pizza

[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:12.560]
Now see here. I ate no pie, burglar. I stole the pizza. I did not steal the pizza

[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:21.640]
You only had one slice. They're okay. So it was a whole pie. Who cares? Those buns had no power. I was hungry

[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:27.880]
I sacrificed a lot too, you know, there was no Dr. Brown's just don't taste the same without the Dr. Brown's

[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:32.440]
As Groot is has that marijuana on Saturday good night and kiss my ass

[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:37.900]
Provo to it five sixty WQ I am happy Tuesday to you. So what's the story moving to the new building this weekend?

[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:40.240]
That's the story that's what I hear

[01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:47.580]
There's a story about an ugly lady, but anyway, um, I wonder what they're gonna do about this ISD anything

[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:50.180]
Are they finishing it early? Are they asking for somebody?

[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:54.520]
It would be nice if they would tell me if somebody's been to show up because the likelihood is I won't be here

[01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:55.700]
really now

[01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:57.180]
Yes

[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:01.080]
Unless they come while I'm on the ear or unless they tell me ahead of time. I don't know

[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.240]
They're not they're just not communicating with me

[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:10.240]
Wait till you hear this that this will this will set you off you'll fall off the chair okay

[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:16.280]
Subject live video streaming of radio show and this is from well, let me just read it

[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.940]
High Neil my name is Donna Rowlandson and I'm the producer the video producer at newsmax.com

[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:29.820]
Great. I've been asked to contact you regarding an idea we'd like to propose involving the streaming video of your radio show live from our website

[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:33.880]
Like I want to be on some right wing some superfascist website

[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:35.740]
newsmax.com

[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:40.440]
If there would be interest in discussing this further, please let me know. I look forward to hearing from you

[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:45.620]
Donna Rowlandson and it's it's legit. It's got all kinds of crap with it. I mean looks like legit

[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:49.720]
I'm choked up about it

[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:56.320]
Isn't interesting all these offers of crap coming through on anonymously on the internet's on the email

[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:02.060]
Remember they were dying for my picture for some thing that we're doing about talk radio on newsmax

[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:05.880]
And they actually found some old pictures somewhere and stuck it on there

[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:12.420]
Newsmax.com. I don't concert with fascists. Okay. I don't want anything to do with your stupid ass website

[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:15.940]
Or you people or anything connected with you people go away Donna

[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:21.340]
The thousand eleven and a half points. Aren't you amazed at that? Yeah

[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:24.640]
And right in line with that here's another one from the so-called

[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:27.420]
Phantom Informer who doesn't have a name even a fake name

[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:28.740]
right

[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:34.940]
Who says okay your comments calling me a geek pissed me off and I started to reply back to you midway through the email

[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:39.600]
It started to sound like the robe young rant so I went with it. Hope we need a laugh out of you. Oh, yeah

[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:47.700]
Actually, Neil. I spoke to Catherine Brown on Friday. She was looking for who the hell are you?

[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:51.020]
Who are you speaking on my behalf you anonymous ass clown

[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:56.100]
She was looking forward to speaking with Norm at least to see what your demands were my demands for what

[01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:02.140]
Isn't that the way it always works that the program director speaks to some groupie a caller that's a

[01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:04.020]
emailer at anonymous groupie call right

[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:08.160]
It's just said that Norm refuses to make a return calls. He hasn't gotten any calls. Okay

[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:14.280]
Because he doesn't know who these people are he hasn't gotten any calls from anybody a cheap channel anybody in Orlando etc

[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:19.020]
How can your agent be so lazy and stupid what harm would it be to have George make a call to Catherine

[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:24.100]
I don't work for clear channel. They did not put me up to contacting you

[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:29.920]
This is the same one they wrote you people are so damn bad. You can't even call people back yadi-adi right

[01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:31.560]
robe young jr

[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:36.840]
The fake fandom informer. He's not even a real fandom informer. He's a he's a rip off

[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:39.800]
fandom informer

[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:41.620]
Not even the real one sad

[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:45.180]
Geek would be I apologized to all the geeks in the world, okay

[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.280]
Like our close personal buddy Tom Velvita. Why was a geek? Yeah, I know

[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:53.820]
We figure that out then there was always Curtis

[01:30:53.820 --> 01:31:00.520]
Feel good and Susie short skirts. You know, there was a secretary WNWS when I was there

[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:06.680]
Susan I think she was like the accounting bitch and air counting lady and

[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.620]
We used to call her Susie short skirts

[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:12.800]
I know that's not very interesting, but

[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:20.240]
That that was her nickname Susie short skirts. Yeah, I wonder what happened all those people

[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:26.560]
There was that bitch sales lady that wound up murmuring Mike moonshine. Yeah, who came to INZ?

[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:32.280]
I'm not gonna waste my time selling your show for a lauzia 50 bucks a spot when I can sell a morning a driver

[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:36.220]
You know like that and I got her the job there. I got her hired at INZ

[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:43.000]
What the hell was her name? Oh my god, it slips my mind. I can see her and I can see that Mike moonshine

[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:46.980]
He was the former salesman gloret the WS news

[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:50.340]
And

[01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:51.660]
He used to pick her up on the corner

[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:57.460]
He'd pretend he'd be driving a home and he would she would sneak out the side door wherever and he would this

[01:31:57.460 --> 01:32:01.460]
Driver on the building and pick her up on the corner. Can't think of her name somebody will know

[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:05.060]
I had an email from Dan Coons

[01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:08.040]
Would you go who

[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:10.440]
Who

[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:14.240]
Would you just say Coons what you call me? Oh

[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:18.580]
K. U. N. Z. Dan Coons that was his name and then there was always Bob Coons

[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:20.220]
Wonder what happened to her

[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:25.920]
Here's one that says this is flea. I can do Georgia's job for her quarter of the money and save the station some cash

[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:27.880]
And we so we can all stay employed

[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:35.280]
Georgia's a no-tell and as clown leeching off you the money we can save can feed fat jolly joe jellie donuts for a year where do I sign flea?

[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:43.560]
Well, I can't believe I can't remember that sales bitch's name. I got her hired and then she you know

[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:44.780]
I was working nights at that time

[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.460]
Ellie Ellie that was her name Ellie smelly Ellie really

[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:57.060]
Here's one that says oh from the fake John Maynard Keens

[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:03.660]
Between hobbling your show with restrictions on material and it is a temporary George

[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:07.420]
I'm convinced that this man meaning Joe has no clue what he's doing

[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:11.820]
I routinely listen to George when you're out and so do many of my friends my friends

[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:17.880]
And we are part of that coveted 18 to 35-year-old demographic advertisers love if you think about it however

[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:23.420]
There's a logical motive to be found if the axe were to come down between George and Joe who would you choose to cut?

[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:28.220]
A guy the audience clearly likes or some guy that's all but killed one of the highest rated shows in the market

[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:33.240]
Sounds like an act of self-preservation on Joe's part if you ask me still listening after 15 years

[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:36.480]
I didn't know there was a contest between you and Joe

[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:40.460]
No, I can't I don't even know Joe Bell. I don't even understand that

[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:46.700]
Oh Lord asked limbauses. I'm visiting your friend in Toronto next weekend with my failing kidneys

I promise you I will stop listening to your show and take that as a threat

[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:40.640]
Why don't you two fags get a room and leave the rest of us alone

Excellent behind all this we detect the ugly work of Joyce

[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:03.640]

Real radio in Orlando is a jackball station that clear channels turn and run into the ground

controversy how to set up phone calls

[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:03.000]
How to discuss with the host which opinion he should have depending on what's going to piss people off the most right basically

[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.400]
How to fake your way through a radio show

[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:08.880]
In other words, what not to do I see

[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:18.600]

Bacon is a killer I think of all the all the food things that you could eat

[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:54.040]
Bacon has got to be one the worst for you probably, but sure as yummy. Oh, it is I love it

You keep asking that like I know something

[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:51.160]

[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:03.620]
What do you think I got the information from if I know anything

[01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:04.520]

Station begins broadcasting from there this weekend we are all told

[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:15.320]

Hopefully when are they going to check that out? I don't know

[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:36.460]
I'm just you know asking silly questions. I don't know. You're bastard. You know me. I'm a troublemaker. That's right

[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:41.360]
Oh, you know just have confidence in our engineering department. They'll get it all screwed up straight now

[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:49.800]
Say your crazy girlfriend just announced that she's pregnant need help finding an OBGYN

[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:56.200]
Well, there's an app for that. Want to get the baby started on the right foot with an extensive baby gift registry

[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:03.300]
There's an app for that great. She's off to a good start now. Are you looking to get out of town and change your identity

[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.500]
There's an app for that. Maybe you want to completely disappear and become a Somali pirate

[01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:15.580]
Well, there's an app for that too. In fact, we have apps for avoiding any new or unforeseen responsibilities

[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:17.900]

[01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:21.300]

[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:34.320]
Ah, now you see how far how this has turned around so fast

[01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:36.700]
We've gone from your new contract

[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:46.220]
And your 5% raise was a 3% raise it was 3% originally right to a 5% cut and pay right whichever one got so I know car

[01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:50.360]
Right and then you're fired and then you're fired

[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:54.840]
I'm done with my bacon. I mean, I'm chewing on last piece

[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:00.800]
Then I'll wash it down with my diet doctor pepper, which you don't approve of. Yeah. Oh, I mean it's more for you

[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:03.800]
Yeah, that's right. I like it

[01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:05.400]
You'd have my portion

[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:12.880]
And I got my diet Pepsi sitting standing by now

That was down 34 points no no big simmous no reason to panic yet, okay, okay

[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:27.460]
We cleaned up the pig flu and the dial and the world is coming away. No reason to panic yet

[01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:28.700]
We'll let you know

[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:36.680]
So his boy Gary who didn't like that sounded at dropping oh, I don't know

[01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:44.360]
Or Steve nickel who has more personality in terms of on the air content Steve Dickel was he yeah

[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:44.560]
Yeah

[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:49.000]
Well, you talk about the popcorn you channel

[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:51.600]
sure truce mm-hmm

[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:58.000]
I mean there was a real weird guy yep weird yep strange no question

[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:03.940]
I never forget that one day I walked into his office was early. I came in early for some reason

[01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:09.620]
He didn't expect anybody to be coming in there and the middle drawer in his desk

[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:15.580]
He shut that drawer so fast he almost took his fingers off. I have a creepy Steve nickel story

[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:19.520]
Yeah, remember how the building was all laid out. It was like a long flat looking building

[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.620]
Yeah, and we used to park in the back as you recall

[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:28.220]
So I had to resume the early shift filling in for my good friend Roger Magdalene who also tried to write my job

[01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:31.440]
Yeah, and all the windows were black because nobody was there yet

[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:38.740]
It was a pitch black still dark out and I was just looking at a wall of black windows as I was walking in and all of a sudden a light caught my eye and

[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:44.280]
It was a light and Steve Nichols office and it was him lighting a cigarette. So all that was lit up was his face

[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:51.360]
You know, yeah somebody's letting a cigarette so it just all of a sudden there's Steve Nichols face glowing in the light and you know in front of a wall of black

[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:55.440]
This was like 4.35 o'clock in the morning wow

[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:01.640]
And he was in there in the office in the dark lighting in the dark in the darks the lighting up a cigarette a lot of people

[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:07.560]
We worked for over the years have been in the dark mm-hmm. I'm gagging on that bacon. Oh man. What do you have to eat that?

[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:10.160]
Don't be eating on the year. Sorry. I talked to him. I do

[01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:16.600]
You know, I think you just touched on your replacement. I don't think it's gonna be fleet all. That's why he doesn't know anything about it

[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:20.960]
Who's gonna be Steve Nichols? No, you just mentioned his name though

[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:27.920]
He's been good Roger Roger Magdalene. Roger. That's right. Hey handsome. I thought he's handsome

[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.300]
What a goofball man

[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:35.040]
Legend in his own mind

[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:40.300]
Maybe he's out flying right now. Yeah, I sure hope that plane don't crash. Maybe that's the one with Kesson Harris on

[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:46.960]
Here's one from Karen from Lareda

[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:53.280]
Remember Lareda Florida see I finally realized by George always sounds depressed. It's the damn management

[01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:57.320]
I would find it awfully hard to come to work every day to a boss who doesn't appreciate the talent

[01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:02.480]
A damn corporation that doesn't realize what they have and who exactly is bringing in more listeners than all the other commentators

[01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:06.000]
If your radio station fires George maybe it would be better for George

[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.780]
I'm sure someone would pick him up so fast the QM would look like fools when they see their ratings into toilet

[01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:12.740]
Ah

[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:15.660]
I think George would be so happy

[01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:21.620]
And if QM I got a bacon bits stuck in my throat. Oh no. Oh wash it down with Dr. Pepper

[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:22.640]
Oh

[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:32.200]
Uh, I'm sure someone would pick him up so fast the QM would look like fools when they see their ratings hit the toilet

[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:36.200]
I think George would be so happy if QM really let him go tell him to go pound salt

[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:42.360]
If they don't appreciate him they're really missing out on the gold mine like the goose that laid the golden egg

[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:47.680]
It sounds like QM is ready to kill the goose. I'm sorry. I ever say anything against George. Uh-huh

[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:52.380]
I now know George doesn't kiss QM's ass and that's why they want him out

[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:56.980]
I refuse to say anything about flea. I only care about you and George. Oh, I find they got a mention in there

[01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:01.900]
If QM wants to let him go George should just tell him take this job and shove it

[01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:07.100]
You watch how fast another successful radio station would grab him up and what's successful radio station might that be?

[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:08.520]
I don't know. I don't know

[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:14.200]
We don't have any anymore. No, we don't have any we don't have any radio stations in much less successful

[01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:16.120]
There's always James crystal radio man

[01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:19.320]
Steve Lapa knows five wide powerhouses. He's got

[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:22.420]
With all starting with oh point oh

[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:27.380]
Neil if they fired George just let us know what we can do to boycott the station starting with their sponsors

[01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:29.940]
Oh, I'm sorry George has to deal with such crap

[01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:33.320]
Neil I don't know how you can stand the abuse he gets. How about the abuse I get

[01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:38.200]
Isn't there anything you can do about it sincerely? Karen? Oh, I love that last part. Isn't there anything? No

[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:41.180]
I'm I'm just sitting back and letting them give can Karen bitch

[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:44.540]
Isn't there anything you can do about it?

[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:46.620]
How do you like that?

[01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:48.460]
Yeah

[01:52:48.460 --> 01:52:49.880]
Yeah, thank you though Karen

[01:52:50.340 --> 01:52:53.720]
Yeah, thanks. Ursus. Thanks for kissing his ass and giving me a sh-

[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:10.720]
Uh, that's probably from the real joebell. He probably likes storm cat

[01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:15.020]
His kind of call bad tune out

[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:18.820]
Wouldn't you think yeah

[01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:22.900]
In fact, maybe he is storm cat

[01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:30.100]

You ready for it? I'm ready. I'm not because it's not off the thing. Yeah, here's the poor result

[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:55.160]

[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:56.440]
77

[01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:02.820]

How's your car running George? What car the one that they traded out for you

[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:27.260]
It's running somewhere sex are running away

[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:32.240]
Anyway, it says I hope they don't do this to George

[01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:39.300]
The changing of the guard at WBAI has picked up speed with longtime program director of renard white put on 10 days

[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:42.080]
Suspension which really said he says means he's fired

[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:47.820]
This is a termination said white and a note to his supporters after he was ushered from the building on Friday

[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:52.200]
I'm not allowed in the building you said I'm unable to retrieve my personal belongings

[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:57.680]
That I've accumulated over my 29 year association with WBAI that's the station that got fine for George

[01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:59.660]
Carlin 730 words 100 years ago

[01:55:00.540 --> 01:55:02.620]
1972 or three whatever was okay

[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:08.440]
Critics of white and former station manager Anthony Rittle who was offered a reassignment last week

[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:15.680]
Sadies moves are necessary to re broaden WBAI's audience without compromising its original mission as a free speech alternative to commercial media

[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:20.440]
We hope this will be the beginning of a renaissance for WBAI since Steve Brown remember the

[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:26.540]
Local station board governing WBAI who argues that under white the station is serving an increasingly narrow audience. Oh

[01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:31.440]
Supporters of white high ever likened these changes to the Christmas coup of 2000

[01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:37.520]
Among the moves at that time the station also changed management before a long campaign brought back many of those had been removed

[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:42.720]
White supporters plan a rally tonight at seven o'clock at Union Office District

[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:44.900]
1707 75 Varic Street

[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:51.320]
White is also scheduled to talk about WBAI Sunday night during a form at 730 at the Salem United Methodist Church

[01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:53.420]
129 street in Palabolvart

[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:57.840]
WBAI is now conducting a fund drive considered critical to its future

[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:00.140]
Brown urged supporters to make the driver success

[01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:04.760]
So the station can start to make back some of the revenues that the previous management has lost through poor policies

[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:09.700]
White and his supporters blame other factors such as high rent for the WBAI offices

[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:13.260]
How do you like that?

[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:20.040]
Okay, the business is finished and this is the business

[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:22.900]

[01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:37.680]
But she's gonna do it

[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:39.180]

Being the proud atheist that I am and Georgia being the heathen that he is right

Maybe that's the problem maybe Joe wishes that you were a little more from you know a little more religious yeah

[02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:06.680]

Will says I may have missed these topics

[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:30.720]
That this is this is just I don't know what to say about these emails about these people

[02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:36.360]
One how did Joe Bell take the position that Greg read once held the bees these gave it to him that's how

[02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:42.220]
Two how did the situation unfold when Greg wanted to fire George about a Howard David email or something?

[02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:50.480]
The situation unfolded that I said absolutely no way Jose or hey and the Moe finally backed off and

[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:59.360]
And Mo admitted he tried to get George fired when he had and had somebody come in near Robert Creeper one of them underlings the Lord of the board the

[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:00.460]
Creep

[02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:03.840]
And it invited me to come in and to wish him a happy birthday

[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:08.180]
And out of nowhere in the midst of my saying hey happy birthday Moe

[02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:12.420]
You know why Georgia still here? I said no because I backed off I did the right thing

[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:16.120]
Which is way of admitting that he tried to get you can which we knew all along anyway?

[02:03:17.700 --> 02:03:22.820]
Well, he was he was just the ultimate bastard. He yeah, I'm surprised him and Joe didn't get along well

[02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:28.680]
Because one thing they hadn't come and they wanted to get everybody fired fired you fired

[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:32.480]
Right right now was Moe

[02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:39.300]
He wanted the beast fired. He wanted Zack fired. He wanted George fired. He wanted me fired. He wanted the Kerala and fired

[02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:41.780]

Wait till you hear this one from the fake James Arnie. I think you might be interested in this okay

[02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:35.380]
Neil I've been very perplexed by all this George Hubbub if I still had my weekly column

[02:09:35.380 --> 02:09:39.720]
I'd write a rip job on it place. It was good to see Tom write his piece Tommy jica

[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:47.180]
A friend of mine who speaks to a member of the QAMS sales staff pretty regularly told me he's been hearing that Joe Bell is on his way out

[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:50.780]
And some other BBGI management type will be taking over QAMS soon

[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:57.060]
I tuned in the 790 this morning to see how Jorge Sedano and that tick were doing awful radio

[02:09:57.060 --> 02:10:02.600]
You know, this is the only comment I've had about that show they've been on two mornings now with our highly touted new show across the street

[02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:04.880]
Jorge and Crystal or Schwartz and

[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:11.240]
Jim Sarni says awful radio while I have to go play my pregness party some Italian sausages onion dip and

[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:15.400]
Pudging my brains out online will make for great today the fake Jim Sarni. How do you like that?

[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:22.180]
Somebody from the QAMS sales staff allegedly is saying that yeah Joe Bell is on his way out

[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:24.520]
Wouldn't that be a shame?

[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:28.240]
Maybe this is his parting shot at me, you know getting even with me

[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.200]
Maybe dumping your ass. Yeah getting getting that me through you for being such a bastard. Not that it's the first time

[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:36.960]
You know

[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:38.200]
What do you mean by that?

[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:43.200]
The management can't touch you so they beat me. What do you mean they can't touch me?

[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:51.120]
Well, what does that mean? They never have been able to they share this hell have can't fire you without paying you off

[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:54.000]
That's what that means well, then pay me off

[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:58.500]
They want to pay me off. I'll take you're yeah, that would be doing you a favor

[02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:02.640]
Oh, they won't do that. Do they want to pay anybody off some of that they don't like you know what the Bruce Beasley says

[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:05.040]
I believe in an honest days work for an honest days pay

[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:11.060]
And jolly joe pats a monitor bag right on Bruce right on

[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:16.140]
They do a lot of ho-hoes together maybe they eat a lot of ho-hoes together

[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:20.000]
George Ann says hey Neil. Thanks for being you

He doesn't care that they're butchering his show because he's leaving anyway whenever whenever it's time to retire

Time for you Rogers retire. No can't afford it need that cash baby. I

[02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:34.820]
So here's the story am I I'm pronouncing his name right QDA that's correct or is it QTA QTA

[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:37.560]
QDA you don't look at cute to me

[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:46.000]
He ain't no Patrick a can I'll take it that well I'll tell you black hawks who wouldn't pay a thousand dollars just for about 20 seconds in that locker room

[02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:50.400]
Patrick can and Jonathan tapes stark naked and Marty have left too

[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:55.040]
Patrick can big game had trick last night and tape scores the winning goal

[02:12:56.660 --> 02:13:02.300]
Is they stuck it to Roberto LeWango man that goes to the Panthers must to hungover LeWango's head you think

[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:05.920]
Must be the curse of the Panteros

[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:09.220]
How the Panthers doing in the playoffs they win any games oh oh

[02:13:10.380 --> 02:13:13.760]
In his first English language TV interviews since photo surface showing him

[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:19.540]
Follocking with a woman on Miami Beach the Reverend Alberto QDA appeared on national TV yesterday. Did you see him?

[02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:24.540]
Yeah, without his priestly collar showing a bit of neck under a white button down

[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:31.020]
Apologizing profusely to the church and fellow Catholics apologizing profusely and showing a little a neck

[02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:35.140]
Wow, I wonder if it's a chicken neck I doubt it

[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:38.660]
So how's chicken neck taking all this you've been speaking him yeah

[02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:41.280]
Is he showing up today with his goods?

[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:47.320]
We are getting together. Yeah, yeah, he'll take care of you. I'm sure you will

[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:52.360]
Tell tell him I'm not over nighting anything, okay?

[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:58.080]
I can't afford the after 30 bucks to Phoenix he listens to the show. I don't have to tell him anything

[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:06.140]
He listens religiously yep chicken neck yep. How's he doing fine does he need money?

[02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:09.660]
Just a joke I

[02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:15.680]
Take full responsibility for what I did. I know it's wrong father QDA told Maggie Rodriguez anchor of CBS's the early show

[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:20.040]
Changing his tune from Friday when he sounded much less contrite in interview with Univision

[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:23.100]
Then he said I will never say I'm sorry for loving a woman

[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:31.800]
Though the photos have reignited debate over priest and celibacy QDA who had even said before the scandal broke

[02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:34.860]
He was in favor of celibacy becoming a choice instead of a mandate

[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:37.800]
Told Rodriguez he believes in a vow he couldn't keep

[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:43.000]
I don't want to be the anti-celibacy priest he said adding that I guess they've gotten to him, huh?

[02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:48.640]
Right adding that at least some in the church had known for while he was in a spiritual crisis involved with a woman

[02:14:49.420 --> 02:14:51.360]
Well probably better than with a 10-year-old boy

[02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:55.640]
Not from the way where they said oh, that's true from where they what sit?

[02:14:56.600 --> 02:14:59.540]
They sit on it. I become kind of a poster boy for it

[02:14:59.540 --> 02:15:02.440]
I don't want to be that I believe celibacy is a good commitment to God

[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:07.740]
He said in my case it was something I struggled with for a long time in confession in spiritual direction retreats

[02:15:07.740 --> 02:15:10.560]
Very good mentors and priests helped me deal with this issue

[02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:12.940]
Maybe they can teach him out of alter boys

[02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:21.240]
The Miami Archdiocese he still has made no indication about QDA's future might be he's been relieved of his duties as St. Francis to sales perish in Miami Beach

[02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:28.480]
Father QDA has a decision to make and he's taking some personal time to do so as spokeswoman Mary Ross agosto said yesterday

[02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:30.580]
She's still there how that old bag. I mean

[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:37.500]
QDA said the romance with the woman in the photos identified media reports as Rahama Boone, Canela's 35 a

[02:15:38.100 --> 02:15:40.920]
divorce mother living in Miami Beach started a couple years ago

[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:45.220]
Friday he told the herald that while they met about 10 years ago and had a mutual attraction from the beginning

[02:15:45.220 --> 02:15:48.260]
The love affair was less than a year old the love affair

[02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:52.460]
So in other words, he's known her for about 10 years, but there's only been screwner for less than a year

[02:15:52.460 --> 02:15:55.080]
Is that what he means? That's exactly right

[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:58.020]
He told CBS this was the first time he broke his vow of celibacy

[02:15:58.020 --> 02:16:02.900]
I entered the 7th or 8 22 years ago. He said in 22 years. I've never had a sexual relationship with anyone

[02:16:02.900 --> 02:16:08.040]
How sad I committed myself fully to my vows. This is the only person I've had sexual contact with

[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:15.380]
The photos which appeared in the Spanish language magazine TV note us were taken on a quiet stretch of Miami Beach a few months ago

[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:18.360]
QDA said on a cold day when no one else seemed to be around

[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:22.820]
He said he believes the lifeguard altered the paparazzi alerted the paparazzi that he was there

[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:24.580]
He alerted the paparazzi

[02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:26.860]
Hey, if I was here with the chick

[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:31.020]
It was an imprudence. He said about his moment of fun in the sun. It was stupid

[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:37.360]
But he wouldn't spell out exactly what he plans to do next. He told the herald that he would eventually like marriage in children

[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:40.600]
But yesterday QDA said he has a lot to process first

[02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:44.920]
My bishop has given me time to think about it. This is a difficult time of transition of time

[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:49.340]
Thinking about the future. He said I've had to you said transition not transition transition

[02:16:49.340 --> 02:16:53.880]
Prodigy jersey to think probably QDA's girlfriend seems to be for marriage

[02:16:54.660 --> 02:16:57.540]
You know any woman who doesn't want to get married to the person he loved he said

[02:16:57.540 --> 02:16:59.380]
I'm ready to pursue my responsibilities

[02:16:59.380 --> 02:17:02.400]
And I'm ready to begin on the road to that if that's what god wants

[02:17:03.060 --> 02:17:06.660]
And I feel in my heart that maybe that is what god wants he wants it

[02:17:06.660 --> 02:17:09.160]
But QDA wouldn't come out and say he was ready to leave the priesthood

[02:17:09.780 --> 02:17:13.240]
That's what I'm in the process of thinking about right now. We said I'm not ready to answer that publicly

[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:17.520]
I first need to talk to my bishop who is the person that I first have to respect in honor

[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:21.740]
Maybe ought to talk to Ann bishop that old dyke or she's still dead what

[02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:26.060]
That would that would turn him back to us something else the celibacy. Yeah

[02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:29.640]
Can you even begin to imagine I'd rather not wow

[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:32.620]
Talk about crotch rock. I mean, I'm sorry. Sorry, Ann

[02:17:33.180 --> 02:17:36.160]
Sorry, Sandy. I wonder Sandy Peyton still got her body locked away somewhere

[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:45.780]
Remember and there was that big snit after Ann passed away. Yeah, I mean her and Sandy over who had control of the body and the booty and right

[02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:50.280]
Mac and on that booty me. Oh, no

[02:17:52.180 --> 02:17:55.580]
That's a lot of mac and man holy mac and on as Joe Bowen would say

[02:17:57.160 --> 02:17:59.260]
Isn't that what he would say. Yeah, that's a big Mac

[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:03.560]
How about those black hawks by the way no emails about the hawks

[02:18:05.380 --> 02:18:09.420]
Surely you know your friend surely the barge of money at the track that day. Yeah things don't work out of the station

[02:18:09.420 --> 02:18:12.700]

[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:24.260]
Thanks again. No problem Georgian. No need to apologize

[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:31.440]

They'd have a hell of a time getting me out of there once I got in

490 votes on the pole do over 500. That's not not great

[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:35.780]

Ah Hollywood at last. I think this is the studio right here

[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:12.640]
I hand mister where you think you're going. I'll see here. I am mo. How would it be?

[02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:17.420]
And I'm here for the new three stu just movie to make it. I wouldn't go into that studio

[02:21:17.420 --> 02:21:21.220]
They're filming a gangster movie in there. Okay, get out of my way

[02:21:21.860 --> 02:21:26.800]
Hello everybody. I'm here the starter of your three stu just movie

[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:29.080]
And action

[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:44.740]
What's he trying to say? I'm dying on the air. Oh, and

[02:21:44.740 --> 02:21:50.560]
Well, let me ask you something. Do you know anybody else in the world who says that? No

[02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:54.020]
Oh, well, at least you got to give it to me as unique. I'll give it to

[02:21:56.180 --> 02:22:00.220]
Will you yeah, a lot of people like to give it to me and what they want to give it to

[02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:01.120]
that

[02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:07.300]
499 on the floor is it let me let me refresh with maybe over 500

[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:09.940]
That would be a half a feather in our cap

[02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:13.380]
Uh 499 like I said bastards

[02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:17.700]
Here's one from uh, that came in the other day that I didn't get around to yesterday

[02:22:18.620 --> 02:22:23.100]
Actually, it came in Friday afternoon. All right from boomer

[02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:28.760]
He says I really want to rant as I write this regarding the people responsible for shortening Ken's life

[02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:34.460]
But those that were there this morning at the V.A. burial grounds and like worth from the station a few mostly ex-employees about six

[02:22:34.460 --> 02:22:39.480]
And some of his close friends of many years had an opportunity to share a few quality highlights and moments

[02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:44.740]
Of our departed fellow broadcaster colleague and friend as he was awarded our his final respects and proper

[02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:52.080]
Naval military tradition having been award war to sailor he was 83 I heard that seems to be most of all what you hear about a person after they're gone

[02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:54.360]
The number of son revolutions they were able to complete

[02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:57.020]
They don't make them like Ken anymore. Well, Mrs

[02:22:57.020 --> 02:23:04.500]
Athorotated crystal clear voice style and professionalism that hasn't been handed down properly to those who are now attempting to come up with enough through the ranks in this line of work

[02:23:04.500 --> 02:23:08.120]
Work that I call this correctly. It's garbage thanks to deregulation

[02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:14.720]
Let's support the current administration on Pennsylvania Avenue to re-regulate and bust of these conglomerates who aren't interested in

[02:23:14.740 --> 02:23:15.300]
Broadcasting

[02:23:16.620 --> 02:23:23.040]
I first met Ken nearly 30 years ago while working on channel 51 the day of Dixon era his main responsibilities back then were wrapped around the Bisqain

[02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:26.200]
Cal Club and reading news at WGBS 710

[02:23:26.740 --> 02:23:30.040]
My friend Larry Knight Stein was PD at the time. How do you like that?

[02:23:31.340 --> 02:23:33.580]
Who worked for me in Kalamazoo and Sturgis Michigan?

[02:23:33.980 --> 02:23:37.340]
As the nature of this or who died a long time ago

[02:23:37.860 --> 02:23:42.140]
As the nature of this or business head your career moving up and down the dial and back and forth across town

[02:23:42.140 --> 02:23:44.760]
Whenever I ran into Kenny was always in a good mood and able to

[02:23:47.020 --> 02:23:51.140]
Something off the stress while in the parking lot having a smoke and a few laughs between newscasts

[02:23:51.700 --> 02:23:57.360]
He always remembered me somehow was an absolute pro at every facility that was ever lucky enough to have his employee will miss you Ken

[02:23:58.300 --> 02:24:04.760]
Joy joebell joeys pitch shame on you shame on you for giving Ken only a week's severance pay when you can't him during the last holiday season

[02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:10.820]
Shame on you for not even giving him the standard at least a week for every one of the 10 years of broadcast service. He gave to WQAM

[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:16.320]
Shame on you for your pathetic budget unable to afford this man's services and what 70 bucks a day

[02:24:16.820 --> 02:24:19.100]
If you people knew about broadcasting and how to sell it

[02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:22.860]
Ken's daily salary would have been more than paid for with just one 60 seconds spot

[02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:26.420]
His superior voice and stature made the radio stations sound like a real radio station

[02:24:26.420 --> 02:24:32.560]
Even though it's nothing more than a collegiate area fairy sports bar with a microphone rest in peace Ken says the boomer

[02:24:33.860 --> 02:24:35.980]
And he liked that very nice

[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:39.600]
Who was also friends with Larry Knight slash Larry Stein

[02:24:40.820 --> 02:24:45.140]
Who lived with me and how Indiana for a brief time when we were working in Sturgis Michigan. How do you like that how

[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:49.100]
How Indian do I like that just how do you like that

[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:53.480]
Don't be making light of how Indiana it's right across the Indiana Michigan border

[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:58.660]
It's right near the uh toll house on the Indiana freeway. What are they'll they call it

[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:01.200]
There's something at the glass house

[02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:08.280]
I've asked about that a few times and nobody seems maybe it's not the glass house anymore

[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:11.620]
Like those turnpike things they have in Florida those restops

[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:16.700]
Where they have like Nathan's and the famous anus cookies and stuff like that

[02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:19.580]
In Indiana they were called the glass house

[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:27.520]
And on a way like driving to say Chicago to go to Washington Park or sportsman park back in the day

[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:29.480]
You get on the Indiana turnpike

[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:33.040]
And then you always make a stop at the glass house

[02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:34.280]
Okay

[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:40.640]
So George Streepie sent us this was much earlier that we were involved with this whole business about

[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:41.960]
Bubba and MJ

[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:45.600]
Do we care about this? I guess so kill some good time

[02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:50.540]
Since they seem to be out of emails of material. Let me just check. Maybe I'm wrong

[02:25:52.260 --> 02:25:58.480]
There is Farrah she won our poll yesterday by hands down your pants. Who's gonna be dead next battles cancer and the tabloids

[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:02.400]
Farrah faucet for initially did nothing to stop it

[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:08.780]
UCLA eventually did investigate and found one of its employees had been looking at patients records

[02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:12.240]
But the hospital would not reveal the name to faucet's lawyers

[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:17.120]
She said we ever responsibility to protect our employees and I said more than your patients

[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:22.280]
The interview with the Los Angeles Times was recorded last August but held until now

[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:28.380]
Times to the release of her new documentary in the interview faucet says cancer becomes your life

[02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:34.920]
It's all consuming then your quality of life is never the same. So what do you think about that rumor that joebells getting smitten can

[02:26:36.260 --> 02:26:42.420]
I don't know wouldn't that kind of like tie in with both the way this whole thing is going down with you. I don't know and with me

[02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:50.060]
Getting in some parting shots remember on the old Hollywood squares. They had parting gifts mm-hmm Peter Marshall

[02:26:50.060 --> 02:26:53.660]
Well, we got parting gifts for which means that you lost and we're gonna give you like 20 bucks worth of crap

[02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:56.440]
Maybe these are some of his parting shots

[02:26:57.140 --> 02:26:57.660]
Could be

[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.080]
Not not related to dr. Fred shots

[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:07.400]
I would have he still hopping around with that you know, he's probably I know what I was your buddy that you mentioned before the

[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:08.760]
Dow's down 29 points

[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:11.640]
And Ferris on the way out

[02:27:12.660 --> 02:27:16.220]
Was that movie was she in the burning bed or do I confuse it was she wasn't the burning bed

[02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:24.520]
And it was hot so she had to jump out really no was there that's the one where she stuffed the guy in the fireplace in the end

[02:27:24.860 --> 02:27:26.740]
I think that was a different one. I'm not sure. What's it?

[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:32.500]
They really creepy guy to look at the she's sprayed she's sprayed him with the bug spray right?

[02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:33.080]
The flea spray

[02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:37.200]
So how's flea taking all this how's he doing today fine?

[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:42.960]
He come by and giving you a big kiss if he gives you a kiss on the cheek I'd be I'd run like a son. He kisses me on the mouth

[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:44.820]
As usual little tongue maybe

[02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:52.760]
Where's that going?

[02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:54.700]
What's she doing with that machine guy?

[02:27:56.780 --> 02:28:02.900]
He was fed up with reading one story after another of our drugs and violence

[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:09.040]
Now she wants to write the rules and rewrite the news in

[02:28:11.660 --> 02:28:13.600]

She's the news into her own hands. What are you going to do with me when I get through with you

[02:28:34.060 --> 02:28:42.140]
Starring and vision also starring Carl Witherz is to wipe Lutterdale and Don not says Don No

[02:28:42.140 --> 02:28:45.740]
There's a stationary one over the midwest and

[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:47.120]
She

[02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:55.980]
All it seems though I've offended Jimmy syphilis with my comments about his former co-worker

[02:28:56.440 --> 02:28:56.880]
Anbo

Digit down he said since man he's been banned from listening to your show in the building

I'm forced to monitor your show myself

[02:29:03.900 --> 02:29:10.040]
When you just said about my late friend Anne was revolting how can you say such horrible things you disgusting creature because that were true

[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:14.620]
Forget going through Harvey green if wqm doesn't do something about you. I will walk

If I go Jim and Joe will follow

[02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:22.340]
Oh, I know for a fact that Ken would hire them and CC would get the contract

[02:29:23.540 --> 02:29:27.980]

[02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:30.300]

Wally is that where you have it now now this this is pathetic

[02:29:39.860 --> 02:29:42.520]
This is so sad. I'm embarrassed to be an atheist

[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:47.560]
Remember this guy told you present of the Florida atheists and secular humanists. Yeah, yeah

But because I haven't gotten right to it here again

No, I don't really care about hearing my name on here

[02:30:01.140 --> 02:30:07.500]
I've seen you the first email in hopes you could help the local free thought community and second to alert you in our local government using tax dollars for prayer

[02:30:07.500 --> 02:30:11.340]
I actually thought it was a worth of discussion sorry to have wasted your time

[02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:14.480]
Not

[02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:18.780]
Not subject not meant for air while it's on the year because I'm embarrassed and humiliated for you

[02:30:19.780 --> 02:30:22.220]
And just like I said before if I didn't get to it right away

[02:30:25.260 --> 02:30:27.900]
How do you like that? Yeah

[02:30:28.980 --> 02:30:34.440]
This is what I've always said and that is that the atheist community has always been represented other than and giggle

[02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:35.580]
Rappin Madison, Wisconsin

[02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:37.340]

I mean she was you know she was a pimp

[02:30:49.380 --> 02:30:54.580]
But she had no credibility because she just I don't know there was just something about her besides being fat and grotesque

[02:30:54.580 --> 02:30:58.400]
Oh, there you go again now first picking on ad bishop and now Madeline O'Hare

[02:30:58.980 --> 02:31:00.900]
Rest in pieces. Oh, I'm sorry. That's bad

[02:31:01.560 --> 02:31:05.120]
You see and that's me heartless and cruel and nasty

[02:31:06.060 --> 02:31:09.720]
Well, I'll get to that thing about the atheist or maybe I won't I don't know I was gonna

Nothing worse than a crybaby in a dolphin wax like a child. Oh, sorry to have wasted your time

[02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:19.300]
That that to me is just pathetic

[02:31:20.500 --> 02:31:25.380]
Aren't you embarrassed and humiliated and just just just to be a member of the subhuman race a little bit

[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:13.460]
But the lawsuit speaks for MJ and his wife

[02:34:13.460 --> 02:34:16.440]
In it MJ accuses Bubba calling him a lion piece of crap

[02:34:16.980 --> 02:34:22.260]
And a snitch snitch and one of the top four five people behind our arrest and trial of the hog deal

[02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:26.320]
MJ accuses Bubba calling his wife Michelle a degrading name

[02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:31.780]
Michelle Schmidt does not appear on the MJ morning show or she does appear from time to time which is in WFZ

[02:34:31.780 --> 02:34:34.280]
LZ which is a cheap channel communication station

[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:37.140]
So this is Cox broadcasting versus cheap channel

[02:34:38.380 --> 02:34:43.680]
Rebecca Harrison steel is the director of the ACLU steel represents the West Central Florida regional office and says

[02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:47.540]
Someone who's a public figure in order to find the defendant guilty of libel

[02:34:47.540 --> 02:34:53.540]
They have to show that they acted with reckless and indifference to the truth or with actual knowledge of that what they were saying was false

[02:34:54.540 --> 02:34:59.160]
Steel says some speech is protected by the first amendment statements of opinion not slanderous

[02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:01.380]
She says but shock jock is one thing

[02:35:01.380 --> 02:35:07.880]
But if you actually make the famitory statements about someone that are true and do injure the reputation in a serious way that to me crosses over the line of first amendment

[02:35:09.540 --> 02:35:14.560]
Bubba loves bunches no stranger to controversy was fired by cheap channel in February 2004 at the time

[02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:20.700]
He drew the largest single in decency find an FCC history for airing skits were cartoon characters talked about sex and drugs

[02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:26.100]
Back in January of the series promised to clean up exactly return to the airwaves in Tampa and Jacksonville

[02:35:26.100 --> 02:35:31.660]
He signed a three-year contract with Cox radio and can be heard on the on the bone in Tampa one of two point five

[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:33.340]
Bubba's on the bone

[02:35:36.140 --> 02:35:38.860]
Sounds like MJ's on the rag and Bubba's on the bone

[02:35:39.900 --> 02:35:45.680]
The tension may have started the day Bubba return to the air in a studio computer screen displayed the phrase MJ sucks

[02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:49.460]
Bubba told Tampa's 10 news back then all of Tampa radio sucks

[02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:54.540]
There's nothing out there. We're number one for eight or nine years even cleaned up and use their friendly will be better than anything else

[02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:57.920]
It's on it's horrible kind of like stop Florida radio. It's horrible

[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:03.660]
Monday night he reiterated that statement the truth hurt doesn't it the bottom line is arbitrawn can just

[02:36:06.680 --> 02:36:10.380]
Something out and I was already number one. It's chopped off in the right hand column

[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:15.840]
I went to number one and two and a half weeks are they're gonna try to tell me Tampa Bay wasn't hurting for something new asked Bubba

[02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:21.600]
Bubba loves punts says if you don't want me to talk about you then take yourself off the air let this play out in court

[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:25.460]
Let me have my day in court. I can't wait for the deposition to start let the games begin

[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:29.260]
I swear to God. He says of course we know who he's talking about

[02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:31.200]
Dale God right

[02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:34.800]
He gets on the everyday meaning MJ

[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:39.940]
He's a public figure it's okay from the book billboards of OG and Britney Spears up and this whole show is based on TMZ

[02:36:41.060 --> 02:36:43.820]
Unfortunately, he doesn't understand is that he and his wife are public figures

[02:36:43.820 --> 02:36:48.820]
I can call them names and be outlandish and be Bubba the lowest fun to be the people's hammer and say like oh like it is

[02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:51.100]
All I want he's the people's hammer the people's umper

[02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:58.540]
He's the people's hammer that was funny Bubba says it's true. He does make fun of MJ's physical attributes being short being a midget

[02:36:59.060 --> 02:37:00.720]
Look you can you guys call me fat

[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:05.400]
He can do all that but the bottom line is little MJ's feelings are heard so now I'm gonna sue sue sue

[02:37:06.700 --> 02:37:09.440]
Tie up the system type the taxpayers dollars type the court system

[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:14.100]
The civil suit doesn't spell out exactly how much money and damages MJ and Michelle are suing for but nevertheless

[02:37:14.100 --> 02:37:16.180]
They're asking for a jury trial to settle a matter

[02:37:17.100 --> 02:37:21.960]
How do you like that a cop to Tom's between MJ Todd Schmidtmeister and Bubba love sport

[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:28.720]
Sounds like a bunch of crap to me, doesn't it? Yeah sounds like shit. It's a big cry baby

[02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:35.280]
Sounds like Schmidt said while screw him. Yeah, a rush wannabe. I wonder if he pops a few luxe's knowing in

[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:40.940]
To dead in the pain from the fact that Bubba's picking on him a poor MJ Bubba's picking on me

[02:37:43.100 --> 02:37:50.080]
Oh look at this found these on the web since Scott and Pinellas Park from what I read the buildings haven't changed

[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:58.720]
The hearties travel Plaza is uh in in how holy moly. I'm going back to how Indiana. It's a hearties on the glass house

[02:37:59.700 --> 02:38:01.720]
Let's have glass. No, it's down the glass house

[02:38:03.980 --> 02:38:07.920]
You know this this whole nostalgia thing a lot of people poop who it but you know something

[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:13.580]
What the older I get the more I realize the truth to it back in the day things think there was so much more variety and so many

[02:38:13.580 --> 02:38:15.280]
I mean all the stuff is now gone

[02:38:16.060 --> 02:38:16.460]
right

[02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:18.420]
The glass house

[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:24.600]
With a big hearties. I love hearties. Don't you like hearties a lot very much that mushroom cheese not not those biscuits now

[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:27.180]
Biscuits and gravy that biscuits for rednecks

[02:38:27.860 --> 02:38:30.260]
Dry and nasty. Oh biscuits with gravy

[02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:33.860]
You know what I like gravy on best

[02:38:34.500 --> 02:38:39.480]
mashed potatoes that's right with the scale like a Thanksgiving when people put am I talking over you or what no

[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:41.560]
I'm talking over you. No go ahead

[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:47.880]
Go ahead and thanks giving Christmas like when people eat turkey dinners a lot yeah and people put gravy on the stuffing

[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:54.440]
No stuffing should be a little bit moist by itself and don't don't mess the gravy on the stuffing put it on the turkey because turkey is dry

[02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:55.720]
Put it on the mashed taters

[02:38:56.740 --> 02:39:00.660]
In fact a little bit of butter and a lot of gravy on the mashed taters is the way I like or a lot of butter

[02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:03.080]
A lot of butter and a lot of gravy now we're talking

[02:39:05.340 --> 02:39:08.260]
So let me ask you to Joe come in and give you a big squeeze today or what yeah

[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:11.020]

[02:39:40.460 --> 02:39:46.920]
Like this dish is delicious my mother cook to their dishes coming right off the stove hot

Pre-feeding check it out luck is a top with four

Seasonings but the test it out I'm in the garden. I'm feeding they're all eating everyone is

Grieving I'm feeding I need you to get up up back to the store buy us some more potatoes

[02:40:08.180 --> 02:40:11.840]

[02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:41.000]
In the sprinkle of a hood come on say it with a little bit of good

[02:40:41.540 --> 02:40:42.740]
In the sprinkle of the hood

[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:45.520]
With a little bit of good

[02:40:45.900 --> 02:40:47.200]
In the sprinkle of a hood

[02:40:47.700 --> 02:40:49.800]
More logical in a little bit of

[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:50.120]
I

[02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:57.260]
Is the business we've chosen

[02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:02.600]
Okay 147 I just reminded me of that when I was listening to that locker thing I'm in raw

[02:41:04.040 --> 02:41:09.320]
Yeah, don't you just love potato lockers? I like them a lot good ones right especially the ones like corkies

[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:14.880]
Used to bring in when they bring in a bird to a task at a tisca we used to love their brisket right and a little potato pancakes too

[02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:16.120]
Oh, god apple sauce

[02:41:16.700 --> 02:41:23.100]
With apple sauce or sour cream yeah, they brought both or both you didn't have to choose that's right you could dip them in both

[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:25.120]
Dip them in dunk them and eat them

[02:41:25.940 --> 02:41:27.120]
Dip them and lick them

[02:41:27.980 --> 02:41:34.840]
And the potato pancakes too. Oh god. There's nothing like Jew food you know what right I guess that's because I'm I'm Jew you know

[02:41:36.980 --> 02:41:42.440]
I guess everybody is like into their own particular ethnic you know like like humans would say Cuban food is the best

[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:49.160]
And Portuguese would say Portuguese Dutch would say Dutch food is the best if there was such a thing besides that horrible pea soup

[02:41:51.040 --> 02:41:56.600]
What was that thing we had yesterday about the Netherlands and about how I'm responsible for what whatever that was all about that was

[02:41:57.560 --> 02:42:04.280]
Bizarre oh about the amuzzle them remember that right and I'm responsible for the being stupid damn many Muslims in my generation did this oh

[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:05.000]
God

[02:42:06.380 --> 02:42:08.140]
So many crazy people out there

[02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:09.660]
Crazy people

[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:12.960]
So we got through another day and you're still here that's good

[02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:19.680]
One day at a time yeah, well, you know when I come in in the morning now I sit here because I generally come in a few minutes before you do

[02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:28.320]
And I shut off the audio from city pulse 24 are swimmable so in other words 86 or 80 per city pulse 24 and

[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:32.860]
And I wait and I there's and sometimes this audio coming back at me back at you

[02:42:33.540 --> 02:42:37.040]
With Joe Rose and stormy or whatever else he's got on or

[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:40.980]
The chronic guests or sometimes it just this sounds a silence

[02:42:42.100 --> 02:42:43.540]
And I'm waiting to hear hello

[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:44.840]
Hello

[02:42:45.980 --> 02:42:50.060]
What no, and I'm hoping it's your voice like this morning. Yeah, I mean

[02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:53.240]
I was pretty sure it would be because of something what happened you the text to be right away

[02:42:55.060 --> 02:42:56.420]
wouldn't you right

[02:42:58.880 --> 02:43:05.720]
Well, just be sure that if something if something goes down that I know about it. I will tell you so I can hire a hitman or something like that

[02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:11.760]
Jocomo says hello. I'm a transplanted fluridian living near Chicago originally from New York

[02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:14.940]
frustrated arrangins fan and frustrated panthers fan

[02:43:14.940 --> 02:43:18.080]
We love the panthers. They never win

[02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:22.160]
God hooked on the hawks a few years ago and last night's game made me cry tears of joy

[02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:24.840]
They seem to be getting better as the postseason progresses

[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:29.020]
Patrick canes last two goals were beautiful not as beautiful as him though good god

[02:43:29.020 --> 02:43:31.880]
It says I could kiss him in the on the lips if I was so inclined

[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:37.880]
Hope we do as well against Detroit. Go hawks has jack well good luck against Detroit for their awesome their tough

[02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:42.440]
I hate them like poison, but the go hawks even George is rooting for the hawks

[02:43:44.460 --> 02:43:49.400]
Aren't you oh? Yeah, come on now big time hop on the bandwagon

[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:54.180]
If they were ugly, I wouldn't really care. I wouldn't have any team. I'd be rooting for but they're not

[02:43:55.160 --> 02:43:56.900]
Oh, here's one about and syphilitis

[02:43:56.900 --> 02:44:01.180]
I'm sure that Jimmy's syphilis who emails you as fake is the rest of this other

[02:44:01.180 --> 02:44:02.420]
Rear portals

[02:44:02.940 --> 02:44:08.340]
Neil in fact, I'm sure they're all the same guy sure probably that bozo in Orlando since there are plenty of references to that place

[02:44:08.340 --> 02:44:11.620]
Which none of us curious about down here, but that's not what I'm writing it says

[02:44:12.280 --> 02:44:17.180]
I used to watch the dolphins games with the radio on even those dark days with zoom far in his pan flute

[02:44:17.180 --> 02:44:22.300]
The local answers were preferable with the network guys no more syphilis is an awful play by play man

[02:44:22.300 --> 02:44:25.840]
I'm not a broadcaster, but he has no idea how to modulate his voice

[02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:30.020]
He screws up calls and having two other jocks in the booth makes it and even bigger mess

[02:44:30.020 --> 02:44:34.240]
Joe Roser managed to be all right mad dog preferably, but both what a cluster flick

[02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:39.380]
Anyway, keep hammering away at syphilis. He's a pompous jackass. He's way over his head on the ear

[02:44:39.940 --> 02:44:44.460]
Take care and good luck to George with Norma writing a letter that he put the right postage on it probably not

[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:47.700]
Oh, that's right. I forgot to send him the postage

[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:51.640]
You think Norma can handle it

[02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:57.580]
Handle what the cost of the post it wasn't it wasn't they snail mail it was an email. Oh

[02:44:58.140 --> 02:45:01.140]
God, I mean even Norma's up to that. Oh

[02:45:01.140 --> 02:45:05.900]
Here you go jimmy syphilis says what do you know about broadcast and you sucked it play by playing those hurricane games

[02:45:05.900 --> 02:45:09.320]

[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:38.960]
But then again who is a Patrick? Hmm

[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:42.880]
Well, I'd sure chase him around for no fart

[02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:48.440]
Here's one for me. It says hello from a new fairly a fairly new listener

[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:52.520]
I thought it said from a new fairy listener. I was gonna play you fair, but I won't

[02:45:53.540 --> 02:45:55.800]

So George is still with us. I guarantee you I think he'll be here tomorrow morning when I sit down and Jimmy syphilis

Even the stench of ambitious dead rotting body doesn't smell as stink as bad as you Jimmy

[02:46:24.620 --> 02:46:30.500]
Your work is pathetic and petrid and I'm sure that the two x-jocks are working the booth with you Jim and Joe who I like a lot

[02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:32.960]
I'm sure they're well aware of it of your shortcomings

[02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:35.960]
Good luck in your new endeavors Jimmy

[02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:00.360]

Well, I got the feedback in what is that in your mouth?

[02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:30.960]

[02:47:35.020 --> 02:47:37.980]
What is your ever just keep your big mouth shut

[02:47:41.780 --> 02:47:44.760]
I can't keep my mouth shut because I've got such a big mouth

[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:51.240]
The next thing I remember is having my knees in my ears

[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:54.040]
Yes

[02:47:58.700 --> 02:48:04.620]
I just don't have a good feeling about this

[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:19.960]

[02:48:23.100 --> 02:48:24.300]
