[00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.000]
The music expressed on the pregame.

[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.660]
Come on, Joe. Take a little more time now.

[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.900]
Got another 90 minutes for it.

[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.260]
Are you not reflecting those of the beaters?

[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.540]
What do you think? Is that sound like a plan?

[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.960]
Yeah, it's for the pregame now.

[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.840]
I'll write the pregame.

[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.780]
Here's blockchain to the team.

[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.900]
You show me this.

[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.440]
I know by stormy.

[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.440]
That was down nine points.

[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.560]
Oh.

[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.580]
Seven points.

[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.380]
560 WQAM.

[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.760]
Presents.

[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.200]
The Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.820]
Five points.

[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.200]
202 WQAM?

[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.040]
202 WQAM?

[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.360]
128 WQAM.

[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.320]
560 WQAM?

[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.060]
502 WQAM?

[00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.640]
402 WQAM.

[00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.640]

[00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.800]

[00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.800]

[00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.800]

[00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.800]

[00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.800]

[00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.520]
24 cents.

[00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.900]
Oh.

[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.280]
Sometimes I feel myself.

[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.720]
The following is a paid public service announcement from the International Ripeball Association.

[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.620]
Let's face.

[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.560]
Most of us will never be rich.

[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.020]
Hell, we probably won't even be successful, and that's pretty damn depressing.

[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.520]
But as usual, with every problem, there is a solution.

[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.140]
Hi.

[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.420]
I'm Jim, and I'm here to tell you a little something about handguns.

[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.780]
They scare their s**t out of people and intimidate them and giving you whatever you want.

[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.800]
That's right, handguns.

[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.820]
Think about it.

[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.640]
Need some cash?

[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.600]
Rob a bank.

[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.180]
Don't have enough money for beer?

[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.600]
All of the convenience store.

[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.540]
Take some chips and pretzels, wire-end.

[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.860]
It's all free if you've got a handgun.

[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.180]
Some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend?

[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.000]
Kill him.

[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.760]
It's a simple solution to life's complex problems.

[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.920]
All you have to do is wait the five days for it, and happiness is just around the corner.

[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.580]
Hell, if you don't want to wait the five days, who cares?

[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.280]
Buy the damn thing off the street.

[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.260]
Just buy a lot of handguns.

[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.360]
It's a great alternative to working problems out and get me considered a population control.

[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.220]
Yes, handguns.

[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.760]
They just might make your fans.

[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.080]
Here you go.

[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.560]
A whole bunch of dead people in Alabama and Germany and all over the world because crazy people

[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.500]
love guns.

[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.440]
Oh, yeah.

[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.840]
See, I mean, bombs, that's another story.

[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.100]
But guns?

[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.260]
I think guns all ought to be illegal.

[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.920]
Even for police, including even taser guns.

[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.000]
They keep showing that thing about that Polish guy.

[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.360]
Was he Polish or Russian?

[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.880]
Polish.

[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.040]
In Vancouver that got tasered and just died right there.

[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.480]
He was in the airport for like seven or eight hours.

[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.120]
Yeah.

[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.900]
High security area.

[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.120]
And they just ignored him until they were more and more educated.

[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.820]
Until they tased him.

[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.360]
Until they tased him and paid a lot of attention to him, made a post.

[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.300]
They tased and tased and he's dead.

[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.620]
He's still dead, by the way.

[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.260]
Well, ordinarily we don't do jokes, but this is kind of amusing.

[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.960]
Let me see your take.

[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.560]
All right.

[00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.760]
Qualve tighten priests were about to be ordained.

[00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.440]
Have you heard this?

[00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.760]
No.

[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.340]
The final test was for them to line up in a straight row, totally nude, in a garden

[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.080]
while a sexy, beautiful, big, breasted, nude model dance before them.

[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.800]
Yes, I've heard it.

[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.680]
It's old, but cute.

[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.420]
Keep going.

[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.920]
Each priest had a small bell attached to his penis and they were told that anyone who's

[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.300]
bell rang when she danced in front of them would not be ordained because you'd not reach

[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.940]
to state of spiritual purity.

[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.680]
The beautiful model danced before the first candidate with no reaction.

[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.740]
She proceeded down the line with the same response from all the priests until she got

[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.220]
to the final priest, Carlos.

[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.740]
Poor Carlos.

[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.820]
As she danced his bell began to ring so loudly that it flew off cladering across the

[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.840]
ground and laid the rest in nearby foliage.

[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.360]
Embarrassed Carlos quickly scrambled where the bell came to rest.

[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.240]
He bent over to pick it up and all the other bells started to ring.

[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.020]
Rectum.

[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.400]
Yeah.

[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.160]
It's cute.

[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.800]
So, but it's cute.

[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.880]
Like me, I'm old and cute.

[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.300]
You're real cutie pie.

[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.240]
That's a bunny.

[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.000]
That was a 22 points.

[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.180]
We only got an hour and 26 minutes before the Hurricanes' pregame show.

[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.800]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.920]
Kane's basketball, baby, and that's the assong I'm going to be leading into the pregame

[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.140]
with.

[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.720]
A ride.

[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.720]
With the beast and clearance and all those other goofballs.

[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.060]
So, clearance is engaged, huh?

[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.740]
That's what I heard.

[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.740]
Now, have you, so you haven't met the future Mrs. Clarence?

[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.900]
No.

[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.160]
Unless he brings her to work.

[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.480]
Well, why not?

[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.860]
Well, what do you mean socialize with our program director?

[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.840]
What kind of anti-Semite are you?

[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.760]
We don't like any of the same things.

[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.160]
Girls?

[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.040]
Well, he likes one, but I doubt he would share her with me.

[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.020]
Oh.

[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.100]
I'm sure that.

[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.840]
Well, maybe not.

[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.380]
Who knows?

[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.140]
Maybe if that's the only way he can get you in the middle.

[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.660]
Here's the poor result from yesterday.

[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.560]
How many votes did we get?

[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.860]
A thousand and seven votes.

[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.340]
Awww.

[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.000]
Staggering and everybody in their brother was sitting in all kinds of sodas.

[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.600]
So does that have been invented yet?

[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.640]
So does that have been drink, drank, drunken by anybody?

[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.000]
Excluding Coke or Pepsi, what's the best tasting soda?

[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.020]
Excellent job by George in reworking that horrible question.

[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.240]
Well, I'll spake English out, learn it in the heels.

[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.940]

You people have got taste in your tuchus.

[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.160]
Ginger ale, 122, cream soda, 108, barks root beer, 102, birch beer, 100.

[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.100]
Those were the top four.

[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.240]
Those were the contenders.

[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.660]
Cains warm up at 1130.

[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.340]
Cains have herginess attack ACC, turn them at noon and if they win, we do it all over

[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.720]
again tomorrow.

[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.900]
Go Cains.

[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:33.720]

[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.620]
What is a lot of money here?

[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.300]
I don't drink soda 48.

[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.260]
I just, I can't relate to that.

[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.900]
Flexing, I don't need ice cream.

[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.220]
I don't eat candy.

[00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.780]
I don't breathe the fresh air or the stale air.

[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.320]
I don't drink soda.

[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.800]
Squirt 42.

[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.920]
But I haven't had Squirt in a long time.

[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.560]
I like Squirt.

[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.840]
I thought you had him yesterday.

[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.620]
What?

[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.440]
The Squirts.

Fresca 41, Mountain Dew 34, Mr. Pib 33.

[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.720]

Inca Cola 4, Inca Dinkadoo, Tahitian Treat 4.

[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.880]
Too bad they didn't make that in diet because that's sickeningly sweet.

[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.620]
You wouldn't like that.

[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.240]
No.

[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.340]
Tahitian Treat.

[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.760]
Like Hawaiian punch kind of.

[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.540]

Oh, Thumbs Up.

[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.860]
Thumbs Up your ass.

[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.180]
Did we ever figure out what that is?

[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.920]
Was it Thumbs Up or Thumbs 8?

[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.700]
Al 8, I don't know.

[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.520]
All these regional sodas that most of us never heard of before.

[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.120]
But that's okay.

[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.180]
George never heard of Fego.

[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:22.780]
Nope.

[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.320]
It came like in little squat bottles.

[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.540]
You know, like about, I don't know how many.

[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.080]
I saw the pictures of it.

[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:30.960]
Oh, you did?

[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.700]
I looked it up.

[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.380]
And still didn't ring any bells.

[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.120]
Oh, sorry.

[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.700]
Nope.

[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.560]
Here is today's pool.

[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.360]
It's a pretty good one.

[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.200]
When I was a child, the first adult I had a crush on was a teacher 116.

[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.980]
No, I didn't have a crush on any of my teachers.

[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.440]
I did.

[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.140]
That's what I voted for.

[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.540]
TV or film star 67, that's what I voted for.

[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.120]
And I'm trying to think back.

[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.280]
In fact, I looked it up life of Riley, Jr.

[00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:58.920]
Jr.

[00:07:59.280 --> 00:07:59.740]
West Morgan.

[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.220]
Oh, my God.

[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:01.880]
Hey, Wesley.

[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.500]
Grab my Jr.

[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.200]
Honey.

[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.680]
Can't find out too much about him.

[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.040]
I guess he's pretty obscure nowadays.

[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.780]
Maybe he's dead.

[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:08.280]
I don't know.

[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.320]
And then of course there was a Sabu, the Indian boy.

[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:13.700]
Yeah.

[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.180]
There was on the bus to Brown show with Andy Devine.

[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.020]
Punk your magic twanger, Froggy.

[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.660]
You couldn't even say that in the air today.

[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.400]
I'm telling you.

[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:22.540]

[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.520]
Not if Joyce had anything to say about it.

[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.520]
Punk your magic twanger.

[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.140]
No way.

[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.620]
And then of course there was a flipper.

[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.960]
But I wasn't, I don't know.

[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.220]
I guess I wasn't a little child.

[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.080]
I was old enough to know better.

[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:37.560]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.100]
Don't get started with Luke helping again.

[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.020]
I'm not good at it.

[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.840]
I never did.

[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.460]
Neighbor 35, babysitter 25, never had no babysitter.

[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.960]
Friends parent 19, Playboy model 10, family member 10.

[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.260]
Clergy member four.

[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.540]
Oh no, not father's tool.

[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.060]
Coach two, what about athlete?

[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.260]
Well, come that's not on here.

[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.920]
It's an athlete on here right away.

[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.220]
All right.

[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.280]
School bus driver one, President None and Dr. Ernest None.

[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.520]
Out of 33 votes.

[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.400]
It's pretty decent poll.

[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.980]
Not not spectacular decent.

[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:13.880]
Oh geez.

[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.360]
Oh Ron Brewer.

[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.480]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.560]
First time we've ever heard from the fake Ron Brewer.

[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.160]
Even you ought to be excited about that.

[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:28.560]
Oh yeah.

[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.740]
Oh my email address has been emerged as one of one of the

[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.520]
200's of $15 million cash.

[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.120]
Oh yeah.

[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.780]
You know if all these things were for real, I'd be

[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.300]
multi-billionaire.

[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.220]
Oh and then this is a goofball.

[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.880]
Another George don't taste me bro.

[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:45.520]
Don't taste me.

[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.600]
That's old and still.

[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.020]
So I hear on the commercial says, Misha, that some kind of

[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.580]
canes pre games coming on 11 3 days wondering if they're

[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.200]
going to push your time slot in the internet.

[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.380]
Oh yeah.

[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.900]
And the internet are going to continue to show.

[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:00.740]
Let me know.

[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:01.920]
Oh yeah.

[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.560]
We're going to sit around to continue to show on the

[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:03.760]
internet.

[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.700]
I'll be out of here so fast at 11 3.

[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.780]
Like shot out of a cannon.

[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.720]
Misha, are you crazy?

[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.380]
Joseph guns don't people.

[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.780]
People kill people with guns.

[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.560]
Have a nice day.

[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.060]
That's right.

[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.980]
People kill people with guns and with knives and other

[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.020]
stuff and rocks and bombs and cars and poise.

[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.820]
I'm going to drain.

[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.540]
No and they're hands.

[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.520]
Yeah.

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.840]
That Misha what time is her show on?

[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.560]
Are we going to stick around and do the rest of the show

[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:28.920]
on the internet?

[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:29.700]
What a concept.

[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.180]
Let's think about that for.

[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.840]
Oh, guess not.

[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.780]
I thought about it for about a second.

[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:36.940]
Not even.

[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.580]
Ron Brewers says hello, Neil, as I'm here taking my last

[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.140]
break of the day.

[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.980]
I wanted to let you know that the uncertainty about

[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.520]
picked the ponies is driving me wild.

[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.940]
I'm winning some money since I started doing this on

[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:47.200]
Friday.

[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.260]
So naturally I'm rooting against the Keynes today plus

[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260]
I hate to beast so it works out for me anyway.

[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.320]
You know, you did well in the ratings despite what

[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:53.840]
anybody says.

[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.280]
It's a tough market plus you got to sports crowd all

[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.660]
around you.

[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.360]
So keep going plus the materials always appreciate it.

[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.560]
I'm sure it is old Ron.

[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.560]
That's old Ron from the appallum Stale Ron show.

[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.320]
Do you believe it's him?

[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:07.460]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.720]
I'm sure of it.

[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.280]
I'm positive.

[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.180]
All let's let's take a different altitude.

[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.320]
All these people are the real.

[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.340]
Absolutely.

[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.280]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:15.900]
The real time.

[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.140]
The real Greg Budeau.

[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.140]
That's Joey Reynolds and the real Larry King and the

[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.940]
real Steve Rondon Arrow and the real yadda yadda yadda

[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.860]
yadda yadda in the real Mr. Radio Mr. Radio.

[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.420]
He's living proof of why guns are necessary.

[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.040]
Chopper crashes in the Atlantic up by a Newfoundland.

[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.780]
Or as they say here, Newfoundland.

[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.020]
Why do they say that?

[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:34.560]
I don't know.

[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:35.640]
Newfoundland.

[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.300]
Oh, that's a buggy.

[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:36.640]
I'm sure.

[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.280]
And they won't works.

[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.580]
Works like a charm.

[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:40.820]
Newfoundland.

[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.180]
So canuckie.

[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.800]
12 minutes after 10 at 560 WQM.

[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.940]
Sorry, me shouldn't 1130.

[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.260]
We're out of here like a shot.

[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.460]
Oh, you should have said shot.

[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.560]
All these dead people and just why?

[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.960]
Because well, people are crazy.

[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:55.980]
People get pissed off.

[00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:56.760]
People are lonely.

[00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:57.660]
People are depressed.

[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.460]
People are angry.

[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.140]
People are sad.

[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.220]
And the other sad.

[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.760]
And so let's go kill a bunch of people.

[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.240]
Be a Roger's God.

[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.980]
This empty building is like a tomb.

[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.760]
I walk it's always at night.

[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.100]
I check to make sure the doors are locked tight.

[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.420]
When I hear a noise, I investigate with my flashlight.

[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.400]
What are you doing here?

[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.820]
My coffee is black.

[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.920]
I drink it.

[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.240]
From a thermos.

[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.680]
From the visionary director of 300.

[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.080]
Why would I protect a building I don't have any stake in?

[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.780]
Because it's your job.

[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.860]
Well, it's a really crappy job if you don't mind me saying.

[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.020]
And why are you naked and painted blue?

[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.400]
Night watch men.

[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.360]
The world will look up and shout.

[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.860]
Save us.

[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.620]
And I'll whisper.

[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:52.540]
No.

[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.600]
No, I can't.

[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.060]
I'm just a security guard.

[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.740]
But they won't hear me because I'm whispering.

[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.260]
Night watch men.

[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.720]
And I have a stained-ethyletic soak over my face.

[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:05.740]
Oh, my God.

[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.940]
10, 17, pretty made-off.

[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.200]
Just a pleaded guilty to all 11 charges.

[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.940]
You could face up to 150 years in jail.

[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:12.140]
What?

[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.060]
Why do they put such stupid things on there?

[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.220]
You could face up to 150 years in prison.

[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.140]
You know anybody who lives 150 years?

[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:22.560]
No.

[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.380]
So why do they put that on there?

[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.160]
I mean, I realize it's technically true.

[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.820]
But because they got to do some math when they start figuring out.

[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.360]
Why can't they just say he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison?

[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.920]
Because he might not even with that.

[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.120]
You're going to die in there.

[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.020]
Even with that kind of a sentence, they work parole out by percentages.

[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.960]
He ain't got no parole.

[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:42.400]
He might.

[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.260]
While you're in T, he's better off for himself.

[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.020]
He don't get parole.

[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.320]
Because if he gets on the outside, but I'm being, he's going to be dead.

[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.000]
Believe me, all those people who go, oh, can you see the line up?

[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:53.980]
Yeah.

[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.380]
I wonder if Sunny Fox is going to go after Moses' name, Saul Fouce.

[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.360]
I haven't heard from the fake Sunny Fox in a long time.

[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.800]
Weren't we here in rumors in the beginning that he was the one behind all these fake this one and that one?

[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.660]
Probably true.

[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.860]
Yeah, we heard that from one of the fake emails.

[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.060]
In Knucklehead.

[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.100]
Take your part, remember her?

[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:14.760]
Sure.

[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.400]
So thank you for playing the grassroots yesterday.

[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.940]
I never knew the name of the band until now, so thank you.

[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.080]
I mean, I understand that you young punk's out there.

[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.720]
Haven't been around to hear the really good music.

[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.900]
You hear this crap now.

[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.040]
It was hip-hop, jibbity-jap, crap, garbage.

[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.700]
I mean, anybody who thinks that P. Diddy is like a musician.

[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.220]
Obviously, he's never heard music.

[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.500]
You know what I mean?

[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:38.040]
Right.

[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.920]
Since I remember Fego from when I was a kid, my grandmother always had cherry and orange figure in the house.

[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:48.720]
But in cans and two-liter bottles, then she switched to Shasta and then I started bringing my own pop.

[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:49.940]
Yeah, Shasta blows.

[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.820]
Have a nice day, take her.

[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.800]
And it says Take her Park Love's Joan Jett.

[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:54.520]
Mm-hmm.

[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:55.640]
She does?

[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.580]
She does? How do you know that?

[00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.300]
Because she signs all her emails that way.

[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.080]
No.

[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:01.860]
Well, I'll be danged.

[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.060]
10.19, boy, it feels like we're cheating or something today.

[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.060]
We're going to be out of here in an hour and some odd.

[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.300]
Some odd what?

[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:11.960]
Odd moments.

[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.040]
Never have any odd moments.

[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:14.860]
Just as long.

[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.520]
I can't find a damn thing about Wesley Morgan.

[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.480]
It's just irritating the hell out of me.

[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:20.640]
Who?

[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:27.460]
And I'm thinking the later years, junior from Life of Rhyme, the later years, when he was like, I don't know, when he was old enough to be looked at.

[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.260]
Because he started a day, he was like a little punky kid.

[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.420]
You know, I don't want the, that's bad.

[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.260]
But then again, I was a little punky kid too.

[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.160]
1950, I was eight years old.

[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.340]
Wow.

[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.720]
And I looked at that show and I thought, wow, there's really people that look like that.

[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.200]
You know?

[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.240]
Yeah.

[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.760]
Oh, yeah.

[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:46.720]
Mimo.

[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.380]
Yeah.

[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.820]
Mimo, I get Mimo gay every day.

[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:51.740]
Really?

[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:52.540]
Yeah.

[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.400]
How is that possible?

[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.480]
The fake gym from Wisconsin says, I got out of South Florida 10 years ago.

[00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.940]
But thanks to the internet, I brought you to Wisconsin with me.

[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.720]
I've never been in Wisconsin.

[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.200]
That's one of the few states I ain't never been in.

[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.080]
Did you see the ABC special on the Appalachian people a few weeks ago?

[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.780]
No, I did not.

[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:16.560]
Besides all of the incest, one of the biggest issues on the other side of the culture warp is tooth loss.

[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.020]
Yeah.

[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.760]
Which they mostly attribute to the unchecked use of Mountain Dew.

[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:21.600]
Huh.

[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.680]
They even put their stuff in their kids' sippy cups.

[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:25.520]
Yep.

[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.660]
Kids are getting cavities in their baby teeth because of it.

[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.920]
Must be great stuff.

[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.640]
Like they need something to cause them to increase tooth loss.

[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.620]
PSU would hate it, I'm sure, and most likely have seen it in Canada.

[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.140]
But tell George to check out the Twitter Park Boys.

[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.540]
So there's always promoting that.

[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.400]
I've seen a couple of episodes.

[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:44.920]
It's very funny.

[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.080]
Really?

[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:46.860]
Yeah.

[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.180]
Well, here's a real indictment of it and a reason that I wouldn't like it.

[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.640]
It's on the cable all over the place.

[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.960]
I just never stopped looking at it.

[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:53.340]
That's right.

[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.480]
Says, best thing to come out of Canada since Bob and Doug McKenzie.

[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.560]
Oh boy.

[00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:58.460]
Sorry.

[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.420]
That's just ain't for me.

[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.580]
Remember Bob and Doug McKenzie?

[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:02.860]
Sure.

[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.220]
Great way to North.

[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.380]
Oh boy.

[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.240]
Not for me.

[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.260]
Yeah, right.

[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.340]
Not funny and the real embarrassing.

[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.560]
In fact, that's the most embarrassing thing to come out of Canada, I would say.

[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.540]
Since Jeff Rumor.

[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.580]
Jackie says, I wanted to see if he tried soft soap, honey, suckle, and orange peel.

[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.280]
No, I haven't tried honey, suckle.

[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.040]
Can't even say that.

[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:24.180]
Honey?

[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:25.400]
Suckle?

[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.300]
I'm with you about the pink grapefruit, but the honey's suckle is great.

[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.600]
Ginger ale with cranberry is my drink of joy.

[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.640]
That's a drink of joy.

[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.480]
That sounds pretty good.

[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.080]
That ginger ale with a little diet, ocean spray, cranberry.

[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.620]
That sounds delish, don't it?

[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:38.960]
Yeah, it does.

[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.800]
In fact, I'm going to leave right now and go to the store and see if I can find someone.

[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.260]
I'll be back about 11.25.

[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.800]
George, don't listen to these miserable people.

[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.220]
You do a great job.

[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:47.680]
Love Jackie.

[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.540]
Well, how do you like that?

[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.300]
Thanks, Jackie.

[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.140]
George says thanks, too.

[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.240]
Thanks for the memories.

[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.900]
So the pick-up pony thing will decide if the keens win and they're going to play again tomorrow.

[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.540]
Pick-up pony will do next week.

[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:01.620]
We'll push it back.

[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.740]
I mean, we're going to do next week anyway.

[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.320]
I'm assuming.

[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:09.500]
As long as they're still in business over there, but nevertheless, don't be talking stuff like that now.

[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.000]
That's bad.

[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.380]
It's very bad.

[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.520]
I'll tell you who's really bad is Joaquin Phoenix.

[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.520]
I don't understand what they...

[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.520]
Well, I guess there wasn't any big deal about him.

[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.540]
No, he's trying to make one.

[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.740]
I think it's contrived.

[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.660]
Well, that's what the story says.

[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.600]
Joaquin Phoenix appears to be getting into the act of being a petrion hip-hop star.

[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.760]
The headline Joaquin Phoenix goes after Heckler at Miami Show.

[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.500]
He jumped off the stage during a short performance at a Miami Beach nightclub early Thursday morning

[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.680]
and confronted an audience member who was heckling him, security guards dragged him back on stage

[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.420]
and escorted the audience member away.

[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.740]
It's unknown whether the confrontation and his pledge to quit acting and start rapping

[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:50.180]
are real or are put on, but actor Casey Affleck recorded the performance on camera.

[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.000]
Oh, I see.

[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:51.720]
Just a coincidence.

[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:52.780]
I guess it's a quinketing.

[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.960]
Casey Affleck and Joaquin Phoenix all these siblings are famous people.

[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.960]
All these klingons, all these wannabes.

[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.300]
In October, Phoenix's publicist's confirm he was making the career switch.

[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.600]
In January, he performed at Las Vegas nightclub.

[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.420]
The next month he made a strange appearance on Letterman's late show.

[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:15.360]
Actor Ben Stiller-Lampoon, that appearance at The Oscars, hundreds of people packed the nightclub

[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.840]
at the fountain with Miami Beach Hotel after the doors opened 10-30 last night.

[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.920]
Several of those in the audience said they came just to see Phoenix who left them cooling their heels for almost four hours

[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.240]
while this Joaquin played house and hip-hop music.

[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:34.380]
Phoenix came on stage just before 2 a.m. smoking a cigarette, wearing a disheveled dark suit, sneakers, and scraggly long hair and beard.

[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:40.160]
He began wrapping to a beat played by the DJ and nodding to the music all the most of the lyrics were unintelligible.

[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.880]
Then he responded to someone who appeared to be heckling him in the audience near the stage.

[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.100]
We have a double-exploative in the audience he said before jumping into the crowd.

[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.760]
It wasn't immediately clear whether the two men exchanged any blows.

[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.660]
I saw the guy screaming at Joaquin and Joaquin just came down and said,

[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.660]
Jorge Iedo of Miami Beach.

[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.420]
Security guards swarmed the scene and dragged Phoenix away.

[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:06.940]
The bizarre spectacle struck many in the audience as the latest prank in an extended far-stage by Phoenix.

[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:12.980]
Aflac and Oscar nominated actors also Phoenix's brother-in-law is making a documentary about Phoenix's career shift.

[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:18.240]
Aflac's camera was filming the whole time so it makes me think he has ulterior motive said,

[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.140]
Luis Gendron 23 of Miami.

[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.300]
I wonder if he's kind of the artist driver, Jules Gendron, who I believe was banned from Poppano Park years ago.

[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.720]
He knows the game he's playing, he's good at it, said, Gendron or Phoenix.

[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.420]
Oh, all the contrived crap.

[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.900]
Vetsha Mr. Ego is big into that.

[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:36.420]
Contrived.

[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.060]
I challenge Mr. Ego to a debate right here and now.

[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:40.760]
Don't you?

[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.220]
You have a challenge, Brian Crane, to a debate.

[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:48.680]
Don't you think?

[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.760]
Oh, yeah.

[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.280]
I challenge you to a debate about something, about some factory.

[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:57.760]
God.

[00:20:59.020 --> 00:20:59.900]
Yeah, just...

[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.200]
Oh, Misha says, let's see.

[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.140]
I guess I'll be spending two and a half hours unhappy.

[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:05.920]
Oh.

[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.660]
And what's this pornographic picture she's got attached to?

[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.080]
Let me print this out.

[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.760]
What is that?

[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.760]
Is that Wes Morgan?

[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.900]
I don't think so.

[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.540]
Oh, no, that's her buddy.

[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.100]
What's his name?

[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.420]
The soccer player.

[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.060]
Cristiano Ronaldo.

[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.460]
Sans Shirt.

[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.720]
Next, there'll be one Sans Panth.

[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.900]
You ever wear a Sans a belt, Pants?

[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:37.660]
No.

[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.340]
You never did?

[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.280]
No, is that like a fat...

[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.000]
Oh, Steve Rattas.

[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:42.500]
Oh, good morning.

[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.000]
You'll have a recommendation for your poll.

[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.960]
How about a sister's friend she was hot?

[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.240]
Says the fake Steve-O.

[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.640]
No, a sister's friend, it's two, you know.

[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.200]
Oh, this is great.

[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.020]
This is the big-o.

[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.980]
The fake big-o sends an email.

[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:01.680]
Listen to good stuff.

[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.880]
I would imagine we can kill an hour easy with this crap that's coming in today.

[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.160]
Great.

[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.120]
Aren't you excited?

[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.740]
Are we going to be making a food show, though?

[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.660]
Are we going to be a part?

[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.500]
I will be excited when the food shows up.

[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.120]
Oh, well, we got the needle deal coming up.

[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.000]
And let's just over half an hour at 11 o'clock.

[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.620]
Don't let me forget about that because that's off of our usual schedule.

[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.260]
Yes.

[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.300]
The hurricane, f***ing blow!

[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.380]
What the hell is that?

[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:28.340]
What?

[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.080]
Oh, that's a good thing.

[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.900]
You know something, it's a good thing I accidentally hit that.

[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:31.540]
Why?

[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.020]
Because I'm on the wrong cut.

[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:33.600]
Oh.

[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.140]
Cut the crap.

[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.540]
This is I With This View.

[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:44.720]
CMZ.com is reporting a videotape showing Sulemon giving birth to her eight babies is now being offered for sale.

[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.740]
You may want to send the kids out of the room before we show you a brief clip.

[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.540]
Push.

[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:50.540]
Harder.

[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.440]
Little boogers exploded, shocking everyone.

[00:22:58.820 --> 00:22:59.760]
Somewhat's disturbing.

[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.480]
All right, start about that.

[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.160]
So my close best friend Rich Pactor sends me some stuff about Westlake Morgan.

[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.220]
He's still alive.

[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.160]
Rack him.

[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:08.920]
He's 69.

[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.200]
I didn't make that up.

[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:11.760]
He's 69.

[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:12.480]
Still alive.

[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.220]
And he sends me a picture like West Morgan, like a little boy, the first one.

[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.140]
A little boy, okay, that's embarrassing.

[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.280]
Maybe Rich Pactor, like little boys, I didn't.

[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.220]
And I still don't.

[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.960]
But anyway, then there's another one later on.

[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.680]
And I looked at that picture and I went, like that.

[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.660]
Just for a second.

[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.580]
Are there people that really looks like that?

[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:36.380]
And of course, as I've gone through my life, I've discovered there are people not only who look like that, but even better than that.

[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.020]
Than that.

[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.320]
You know what I mean?

[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.860]
Oh, we got less than an hour to go here.

[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.920]
And Hurley Kane's warm-up pregame, whatever it is.

[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.780]
In fact, here's another horror he was says,

[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.860]
Ola, hey, Neil, Ola, George.

[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.640]
I just wanted to say how excited I am about the Kane's game.

[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.280]
Although we've struggled throughout the year, we still have a shot of making it to the NCAA tournament.

[00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.300]
We would have to be Virginia Tech today, then be North Carolina, the Marna Garentiath.

[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.940]
If not, we'll end up playing in the NIT.

[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.060]
What's your professional opinion of the Kane's basketball team, Neil?

[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:05.640]
They suck.

[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.460]
You think McClinton will step it up?

[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.560]
Don't know, don't care.

[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.000]
I'm sure George has an opinion on this matter.

[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.240]
Keep up the great work, awesome sports radio.

[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.740]
We don't know, we don't care.

[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.520]
We're just glad they're playing at 1130 this morning.

[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.320]
Oh, are we happy?

[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.260]
We love the Kane's when they get us out of here early.

[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.820]
And as you've been working on studying it a bunch of emails now about South Park.

[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.380]
Yeah, it was a...

[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.700]
Brandon and Zisco, both chiming.

[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:36.360]
Brandon says, did you, do you or George have to catch the 13 season premiere of South Park last night?

[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.080]
Did you see it?

[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:37.640]
Of course.

[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.740]
It was a very good episode that centered around Kenny's new girlfriend and the Jonas Brothers.

[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.900]
The Jonas Brothers.

[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.180]
It's one to see.

[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.460]
And making her cameo in the episode, pushing the Jonas Brothers around was Mickey Mouse.

[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.300]
Mickey Beath the hell out of Joey Jonas was very entertaining.

[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.720]
If you've seen it, if you haven't seen it, you can catch the replay at 10 o'clock Comedy Central.

[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.660]
I'm going to go in the...

[00:24:58.660 --> 00:24:58.880]
Record it.

[00:24:58.940 --> 00:24:59.340]
T-voit.

[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.260]
I'm going to, yeah.

[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.620]
T-B-R-D-B-R, whatever they call it.

[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.180]
Make it a perk.

[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:04.680]
You'll be glad you did.

[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.200]
The Jonas Brothers?

[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:06.700]
Oh, yeah.

[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.460]
They're not in it, though.

[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.000]
Oh, yeah.

[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.120]
Is Wesley Morgan in it?

[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:10.680]
Who?

[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.000]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:14.480]
Oh.

[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.240]
Well, that's the poll question.

[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.320]
My God, as we were, and of course it depends on your age.

[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:25.620]
Now, let's face it, if you were old fart like me, it's the early days of television.

[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.060]
So, in those days, it was like, oh my God, there are people look like that in the world, you know?

[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:35.840]
Like, it will open up a whole new world television.

[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.800]
Now, I mean, everybody who grew up with it, it's like you're just taking for granted.

[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.660]
And this and which now, there aren't...

[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.720]
Well, they just aren't that many.

[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.260]
Most of those shows, like on MTV, the people are gross.

[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:47.940]
You're off.

[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:48.560]
You're rejected.

[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.420]
You're out.

[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.280]
You're... I go away.

[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.320]
You know, all that crap.

[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.460]
And then, Paris Hilton, you want to be Paris' best new girlfriend or whatever that...

[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.340]
Oh, my God.

[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.200]
The thrill that they put on here, yeah.

[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:00.880]
Have you seen that?

[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:01.840]
How much does it pay?

[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.840]
Yeah, it's seen that...

[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.520]
What do you call it?

[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.500]
Promos for it?

[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:06.700]
Yeah.

[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.160]
The homos that I'm not going to actually watch that.

[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.100]
Zisco says, you probably missed a new South Park last night.

[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.860]
If you did, you should catch it.

[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:19.300]
As Georgia was a knee slapper, heads pretty close to a specific show, but take care of the Z-Sidesco.

[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.080]
Was it a side splitter?

[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:21.380]
Yeah.

[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.140]
Way beyond knee slapper.

[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.760]
Wow. And Mickey Mouse attacked a Joey Jones, huh?

[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:26.240]
Big time.

[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.460]
Deep to crap out of him.

[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:27.740]
Oh, yeah.

[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.060]
Did he grab his goods?

[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:29.940]
No, his bags.

[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.300]
Oh, Jerry says, parent...

[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.940]
Oh, add to the poll, parent's friend.

[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:34.920]
What are my mother's best friends?

[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.420]
Was this beautiful Puerto Rican chick?

[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.280]
Parents' friend.

[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.080]
Got it.

[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:39.900]
To the poll.

[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.740]
As you were a youngster growing up and you were like, oh, look at that.

[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.780]
There's somebody who looks like that, whoever it was.

[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.120]
Demzy says, Joan River did commercials for Dive's Faggot Fego.

[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.140]
And Fego's Celter was good.

[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.440]
Windix used to carry it down here.

[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.560]
See, I don't understand that.

[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.040]
How can there be a bad Celter?

[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:02.920]
That's a good question.

[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.340]
Isn't all Celter pretty much the same carbonated water?

[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:06.820]
Right.

[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.360]
It ought to be.

[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.340]
Maybe, you know, nasty tasting water makes nasty tasting Celter.

[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.660]
No, I never had bad Celter.

[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.840]
I remember the famous used to have the bottles.

[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.460]
The big bottles of Celter on the table.

[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.180]
Because you get such a heartburn from all that good stuff from the fried duck.

[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.000]
Well, what were those fried creploth?

[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.180]
Oh, God.

[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.320]
When that place went under, that was the beginning of the end.

[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.920]
I always said it was croquies, but it was the famous.

[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.940]
That was the beginning of the end for a South Florida's we used to know it.

[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.940]
Back when the Jews ran it.

[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.820]
That's those were the days when the Jews ran like, you know,

[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.800]
Hymen Roth.

[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.020]
He used to walk his dog on the beach on Collins Avenue.

[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.540]
He was such a wonderful man.

[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.300]
They loved him.

[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.000]
They loved Marlensky on the beach, you know that?

[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:51.740]
Yep.

[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.260]
And they loved that little dog.

[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:59.760]
Hymen Roth, one of the unsung heroes of the Godfather trilogy.

[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.700]
When you say, yep, Hymen Roth.

[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.360]
He had that post nasal drip.

[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.280]
I think that's a Jewish thing.

[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.540]
Post nasal drip.

[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.520]
It's for me and all that deli.

[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.260]
I thought it was because he was a...

[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:15.240]
Dying.

[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:16.500]
Old and dying.

[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:16.960]
Yeah.

[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.420]
My uncle did that all his life and then it'd be even before he was old and dying.

[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.540]
He's dead now though.

[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.100]
My uncle, Hymen.

[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.240]
Misha says, guess I'll be spending two and a half hours unhappy.

[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.240]
I just thought the loyal listeners would have stuck around on the Internet.

[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.020]
I know I would have.

[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.020]
Who cares about the ball game on the radio anyway?

[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.420]
Christian on my favorite, but I'm willing to share, still love your Misha.

[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:44.620]
And here's pictures of Christian on the beach.

[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.240]
Boy, he's pretty God.

[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.240]
I don't know, but he ain't no Wesley Morgan.

[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.580]
I think I West Side, I don't know.

[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.740]
Leave it to Rich Pactor.

[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.440]
Into obscure stuff.

[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:56.160]
Thanks Rich.

[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.700]
69 and still alive.

[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.280]
I wish you don't look too good now though.

[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:02.860]
That's the problem.

[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.140]
All these people that we got all excited about years and years and years ago.

[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.940]
Now they're old and daughtering like me.

[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.860]
Guess where I'm going by the way, 11.30 this morning.

[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:11.800]
I don't know, a woodbind.

[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:12.880]
Ah, good guess.

[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.180]
Oh, that's all he does is go there and sit by those lawn machines.

[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.980]
Yeah, you also eat poop and sleep.

[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.060]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.900]
And exchange text messages with Paco.

[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.000]
And every once in a while I'll get to see him, but he's busy.

[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:27.660]
He's busy now.

[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.960]
And now that he can drive all by himself all the time now, who's going to see him, you know.

[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:33.920]
Isn't that true?

[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.360]
Should I get myself a customer of that?

[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:41.000]
Once kids get their full driver's license and they can drive whenever and wherever they want, legally.

[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.020]
Then you never see him anymore, right?

[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:43.540]
No.

[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.020]
Not right or yes, right?

[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.220]
Incorrect.

[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:47.760]
Oh.

[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.660]
That depends on the person.

[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.360]
Well, when they're busy.

[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.100]
The big old says, you're the reason why my ratings are terrible.

[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.200]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.160]
Every afternoon, about 153 pm, you sign off to play commercials.

[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:05.840]
If that isn't enough to scare away your audience, then you come back and play the same drop in every day.

[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.220]
It stinks in Miami town.

[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:07.640]
That's right.

[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.600]
It's part of the show.

[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.360]
And then one of the same two or three tired old bits every single day.

[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.860]
It's as if you're giving the signal to shut the radio off.

[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.020]
I don't have to give a signal.

[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.740]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.440]
Of course, by the time I get on, no one's left in the audience.

[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:25.300]
It's obvious that you're trying to sabotage my show and no wonder that everyone on that time slot is failed.

[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.300]
Everyone except the mad dog used to have giant numbers in there from two to four.

[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.620]
Even so, I still have acquired more new listeners in the past year than you have.

[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.540]
Your audience may be larger, but everyone knows it's a bunch of old people who've been listening forever.

[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.900]
You haven't picked up any new listeners in a decade.

[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.300]
Signed the big.

[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:40.700]
Oh.

[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.340]
And of course that stands for a lot of things.

[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.120]
Like one point like that.

[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.180]
Oh, it's the fake big old subject.

[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.500]
Sabotage.

[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.300]
Oh, Neil!

[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.780]
You're the thing to Neil Rogers.

[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:50.940]
Well, here we go again.

[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.960]
Uncultured, it's four years later.

[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.300]
Five, sixty, Q-A-E.

[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.840]
I'm son of a bitch.

[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.800]
In India, we like to drink.

[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.040]
So the dot has some fees.

[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:09.340]
But now we got some funky stuff.

[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.860]
That's made with bovine whizz.

[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:17.020]
I'd like to teach the world to drink.

[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.000]
A glass of some cow pee.

[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.620]
You'll never go back to drinking coke.

[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.480]
Cause cow urine's tasty.

[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.800]
It's the reality.

[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.260]
Cow pee.

[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.140]
It drinks up today.

[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.960]
It is very salty.

[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.240]
It's the reality.

[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.800]
It's the real thing.

[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:39.540]
Well, guess what?

[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.440]
A Hindu cultural group plants to launch an alternative cola drink,

[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.860]
speaking of yesterday's poll,

[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.080]
made from a fusion of medicinal herbs and cow pee.

[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.860]
The RSS, a Hindu nationalist conservative party,

[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.820]
plants to sell guajal or cow water

[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.980]
as a rival to soft drink giants Pepsi and Coke.

[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.800]
Sounds really tasty, don't it?

[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:01.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.960]
Never had that taste, don't it?

[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:04.160]
No.

[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.320]
The drink has been developed by whatever happened with the

[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.900]
alley hoopla about the donuts.

[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.120]
What the hell, what was it?

[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:11.720]
I don't know.

[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:11.920]

[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:12.800]
Crispy cream.

[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:13.940]
Crispy creams, yeah.

[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.920]
Everybody started dying from eating all of them

[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.580]
because they discovered that they were just killer.

[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:19.700]
Loaded sugar?

[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.120]
Yeah, loaded with, loaded with,

[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:22.680]
a lot of sugar.

[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:24.700]
Killer, killer donuts.

[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.520]
How could you see a donut like that and not realize?

[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.360]
Hey, listen, if it tastes that good, who cares?

[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:31.980]
You can't eat only three.

[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:32.620]
I can't.

[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.500]
The drink has been developed by the

[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.920]
compound protection department of the RSS.

[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.400]
The organization is based in one of four holy cities

[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.420]
on the River Ganges.

[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.740]
I'm a procage, the head of the RSS told times online,

[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.620]
that the bovine brewed squirtly being tested

[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.320]
and will soon be made available to the public.

[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.520]
He added the drink will not contain any additives

[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.940]
and that the inclusion of

[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.600]
anniur-vidic herbs ensures it doesn't smell bad.

[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:56.740]
Oh, man.

[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.960]
Can you imagine if it did smell bad,

[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.000]
mixing that with some curry?

[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.420]
Woo, what a meal.

[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.480]
The cow is sacred to Hindus and the RSS is already

[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.200]
promoted and it's urine has a cure for everything

[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.440]
from liver disease to cancer.

[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.100]
Oh, yeah.

[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.600]
Oh, well, we heard it once already.

[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.260]
What do you think?

[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:16.340]
Cowpey.

[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:16.900]
Great.

[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.420]
Whoopi for cowpey.

[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.360]
Those are Indian folks, man.

[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.040]
They sure got a real sense of humor.

[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:25.080]
I'll say.

[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.660]
The cows have 89 points.

[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.820]
Wow, let's hear it.

[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:28.160]
Whoopi.

[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.340]
Whoopi and cowpey.

[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.060]
Oh, look at that.

[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.120]
So long, Sirus Tower Willis Group to rename

[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.240]
the landmark in Chicago.

[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.280]
Well, whoopi do.

[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:35.700]
Big deal.

[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.680]
411 votes on the pool.

[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.460]
Teacher is winning when I was a child.

[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.560]
The first adult I had a crush on was a teacher.

[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.320]
144.

[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.700]
That's because you're all, oh, oh, oh,

[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:46.320]
oh, and let's see.

[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.060]
What does Brandon say?

[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.000]
After doing little research,

[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.140]
last night, South Park won't air in Canada

[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.520]
until Friday, March 13.

[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:53.900]
That sounds like tomorrow to me.

[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.820]
So be on the lookout for it then.

[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.100]
Also, it's the first South Park episode in HD.

[00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.580]
Well, how do you like that?

[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.680]
How about you didn't know that?

[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:01.120]
Nope.

[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.400]
Well, you're supposed to be the expert.

[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.260]
Oh, Yoshi Schmendrick wants to know

[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.320]
who's doing the pregame show.

[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.400]
Please tell me it's not the Beast and Josie.

[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:12.580]
So I can run as far as I can, whatever.

[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.340]
Sad day in WQM history says Yoshi.

[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.580]
Oh, yeah, like this is the first time that they preempted us

[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.680]
for some stupid ass UM Bull crap,

[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.720]
some baby crap that their clearance has got his finger deep

[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:23.960]
into.

[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:25.080]
That's what it's all about.

[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.240]
Clarence and the Beast and the Keynes.

[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.480]
Clarence, like I keep telling you,

[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.560]
didn't even go to school there.

[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:30.780]
Didn't go to state pen or something?

[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.580]
Yeah, he went to Penn State.

[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:35.280]
Penn.

[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.020]
He went to Penn?

[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:37.580]
Yes.

[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.220]
Oh, that's one of those Ivy League schools.

[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.180]
Yeah, Yoshi does.

[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.580]
Oh, no.

[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.780]
Oh, are you Schmendrick me?

[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.480]
That explains a lot.

[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.200]
He's getting married though, Clarence.

[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.720]
He's engaged and he's getting married.

[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.040]
He's going to be like a real man's going to start

[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.860]
procreating, making babies, although.

[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.900]
I don't know if he's got what it takes to make babies,

[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.360]
but I don't want to find out either.

[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.680]
He was searching for it that one day.

[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.620]
I remember a couple of years ago.

[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.560]
Oh, God.

[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.720]
I saved a couple of years ago.

[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.680]
We realized it's like seven and a half years.

[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.200]
That I've been doing most of the shows from here

[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.720]
and recently for all of them.

[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:11.940]
What?

[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:12.700]
Yeah.

[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:14.900]
But back in, well, I don't know.

[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.000]
Now that won't be an interesting piece of trivia.

[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.220]
Mr. Radio could work on that.

[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.800]
When's the last time Neil did a show from in the studio down there?

[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:23.660]
Oh, you hear that?

[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.880]
Come in to get you.

[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.100]
Now they're coming to your Clarence because he's doing

[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.340]
the old reach around.

[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.160]
Neil at Publix, they have Sunkiss and A&W

[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.440]
fountain ice cream flavored orange root beer soda.

[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.320]
What?

[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.040]
Sunkiss and A&W fountain ice cream flavored

[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.420]
orange slash root beer soda.

[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.860]
What does that mean?

[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.720]
I don't know.

[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.860]
And also they have a few different brands

[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.740]
that current jelly including their own public's brand.

[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.140]
A&W fountain ice cream flavored orange slash root beer soda.

[00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.000]
I don't understand it.

[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.980]
Maybe somebody will draw a diaphragm for me.

[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.560]
Don't forget in 12 minutes we got our

[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.400]
Neil deal coming up.

[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.700]
I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to do the spot now

[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.160]
like all separate by itself.

[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.160]
Okay.

[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:10.800]
Good idea.

[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.900]
Well, no, because we've got to coming up at 11 o'clock.

[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.160]
I mean the people, the automated log-grain machine

[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.720]
had no way of knowing that we were doing that.

[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.500]
The auto logger.

[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.100]
The auto logger had no way of knowing we were going to be doing it noon.

[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.280]
And then we had this horse ball game coming up.

[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.000]
The keen.

[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.500]
Oh my god.

[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.100]
Get on the love train for the canes.

[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.780]

And George loves the field and he's sitting there breathlessly waiting for the free lunch to come in.

[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:05.300]
Yes, I can.

[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.440]
Yes, I am.

[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.640]
Yes, he is.

[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.060]

Get on to wqm.com and find them I push and they get ready.

[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:43.660]
Get poised.

[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:44.880]
Get armed and loaded.

[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.700]
Or just get loaded.

[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:49.680]
Now wasn't that a good idea.

[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.060]
I think that was a magnificent idea.

[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:51.560]
Yes it was.

[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:52.580]
We had like a meter on it.

[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.300]
After the after the fact.

[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.700]
Would be a bad idea.

[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.720]
The fake Steve Rodden Eros' had just got a call from Cambril Martian.

[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:05.520]
He wants to know if you can bring some Czech soda of the reunion picnic April 18th.

[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.820]
Remember Czech soda from Windixie?

[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:07.740]
Yep.

[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:08.840]
Horrible stuff.

[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:09.660]
Yep.

[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.740]
It says stop at any local Windixie.

[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.800]
Brian Norcross likes the grape soda flavor.

[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.000]
Brian Norcross.

[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.580]
That's what the fake Steve Rodden Eros says.

[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.940]
And you may raise your good point.

[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.860]
That is that most of the people in the audience don't remember Steve Rodden Eros.

[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.860]
Who used to be a TV news guy in town.

[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.440]
And they don't know from Greg Budell because let's face it.

[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.080]
Ancient history.

[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:29.920]
Yeah.

[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.940]
Most of these people in history are the fake.

[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.780]
At least the fake Barry Jackass.

[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.500]
He's still around.

[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:34.740]
Yeah.

[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.860]
Pretend to be some current people.

[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.140]
Would you?

[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.080]
Yeah. Pretend to be some people that somebody might know who the hell they are.

[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:39.940]
Like Tom Jicke.

[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:40.500]
That's a good one.

[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:41.460]
The fake Tom Jicke.

[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.500]
Bad material but at least a good name.

[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.800]
Oh, a storm cat is back again with a threat.

[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:48.760]
Oh boy.

[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.500]
Eyes getting really nervous now.

[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.240]
Are you threatening me?

[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.140]
Oh, this crap is going to stop.

[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.600]
I got a friend and Mrs. Saga and a homeboy London Ontario.

[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:59.040]
Joe told me you don't even live here and you instigate with everybody.

[00:38:59.080 --> 00:38:59.760]
No one likes you.

[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:00.860]
They go don't like you.

[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.720]
Goldie don't like you.

[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.080]
And even Kimba Bocaper hates you because you start with everybody like a damn girl.

[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.420]
Yeah, that's me Stormy.

[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.380]
I'm like a damn girl.

[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.540]
Got a friend and Mrs. Saga.

[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:10.680]
And one in London.

[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.980]
You know how far away London is?

[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.140]
London's over by Detroit.

[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.060]
It's over by Windsor.

[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:14.920]
Okay.

[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.000]
So maybe his friend's going to drive all the way over from London to track me down.

[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.840]
Kick my ass.

[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.300]
Threats from a stormy.

[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.440]
Oh boy.

[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.420]
Obs says I couldn't tune into your show in the days after Mr. Harvey's death.

[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.020]
Paul Harvey.

[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.140]
We would have liked to hear your comments if any.

[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.200]
Yeah, I said he's dead.

[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.340]
One thing you have to give the guy credit for his longevity.

[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.100]
That is correct.

[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.600]
He was 90 freaking years old.

[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.280]
He was on here for like 50 freaking years.

[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.220]
Wow.

[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:42.460]
Long Javiti.

[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.820]
I always thought he was like a not not ultra right wing, not like right wing today, but

[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.740]
to the right of Genghis Khan and the terminally boring.

[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:53.600]
Good day.

[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.580]
But I don't knock him out of these dead.

[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.080]
That's bad.

[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:56.560]
Why not?

[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.280]
Personally, I thought he was great.

[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.740]
Bob said I will miss his good morning.

[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:00.100]
America.

[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:00.600]
It's Friday.

[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.880]
Maybe you should steal it just like everything else you steal.

[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.340]
Just kidding.

[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.840]
No one else has been ripped off more than Uncle Neil says Bob.

[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:07.380]
Take care.

[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:07.980]
Thanks, Bob.

[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.900]
Yeah, Bob.

[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.920]
Now Paul Harvey, he was a legendary.

[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:11.840]
You got to give him his due.

[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.760]
He was, you know, right?

[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:14.540]
Absolutely.

[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.000]
I mean, absolutely.

[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:16.780]
Yeah.

[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.760]
But I mean, not my cup of tea.

[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.480]
Then again, I don't like anybody anyhow because I'm a miserable old bastard.

[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.260]
So he's going to die lonely and miserable and horrible death.

[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:25.940]
Yeah.

[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.920]
I'll be dying at my machine.

[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.280]
That was up 106 points.

[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.020]
Wouldn't that be something to die at the machine?

[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.240]
The history of no call.

[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.260]
No, what is that?

[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:37.900]
Oh, no, Cal.

[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.620]
I thought it was the history of no calls.

[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.860]
This is from mostly C.

[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.660]
Remember Wesley C.

[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.600]
And Lakeland who used to be good and then he got bad.

[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.520]
Maybe now he's good again.

[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:46.900]
I don't know.

[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.200]
I doubt it.

[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.720]
Because even he says all the stuff he sends is crap.

[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:52.900]
West C. and Lakeland.

[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:53.520]
Okay, West.

[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.380]
I'm printing it out right now.

[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.520]
I'm right on the edge of my C.

[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:57.960]
The down's up.

[00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:58.900]
I'm 1688.

[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.460]
Chopper crashes in the Atlantic.

[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.840]
Down off the newfound land coast.

[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.620]
How much of their heavy dude there on CNN?

[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:06.500]
With it right now.

[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.720]
But I watch on CBC.

[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.360]
They're really heavy duty with it.

[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.000]
His lawyers to say why he should not go to Yale.

[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:13.720]
They're on the very middle.

[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.140]
More than 150 years.

[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:15.640]
How do you like that?

[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.720]
If these counts.

[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.700]
If he is, in fact, found guilty of all of them.

[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.940]
And he's pled guilty.

[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.800]
What's going to happen at this point?

[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:25.740]
He's very likely that he'll be a strong argument for him to go to jail.

[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:26.580]
Because he's clear.

[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.460]
Can't let the way Marty Adler calls Eraser Windsor.

[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:28.920]
Fungfeng.

[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.100]
You don't get out of jail.

[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.600]
Certainly even with parole of 150 years sentence.

[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:33.820]
And what about the victims?

[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.980]
The individuals?

[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.700]
The ones who just said he ain't going to get out of parole.

[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.160]
That's why they made 150 years sentence.

[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:38.960]
Isn't that what you said before?

[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:39.540]
Yes.

[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.040]
Very perspricious on your part, Mr. George.

[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:43.760]
That was very good.

[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.380]
It's how it works.

[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:50.600]
So anyway, that chopper is down off the coast of Newfoundland.

[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:51.320]
Newfoundland.

[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:52.760]
I don't think I'm ever going to be going there.

[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.100]
Although I'm sure I've flown over that.

[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.560]
You fly over Nova Scotia and all of that.

[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.040]
All those.

[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.500]
Oh, in fact, when you fly back and they take their route,

[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.640]
you know, when they go way up north.

[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:06.160]
And then they come back down over Northern Canada.

[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.360]
And then you take that route and like especially in the wintertime,

[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.420]
when you're flying back from Europe, oh my god.

[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.240]
It's just it's uninhabitable.

[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:14.900]
It's just, well, it used to be all ice.

[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:15.940]
Now it's probably just water.

[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:17.680]
Nothing.

[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.120]
There's any such thing as global warming.

[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.200]
But it used to be all just ice.

[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.460]
And you wonder who the hell could live there?

[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.300]
And the obvious answer is nobody.

[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:24.980]
Nobody knows.

[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.660]
Wesley writes, the history of no cowl.

[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:32.500]
In 1904, a highman courier Russian immigrant who began selling soft drinks

[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.380]
in Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York years later when we came in

[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.760]
to follow the Jewish sanitarium for chronic disease.

[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.720]
Now the Kingsburg Jewish Medical Center, he and his, um,

[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.520]
something Morris, his boyfriend, I don't know who that is,

[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.660]
came up with a novel idea to create a special beverage street for the hospital's

[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.040]
cardiovascular patients and diabetes patients.

[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.100]
Highman and Morris developed a line of sugar-free soft drinks which they called no cowl.

[00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:01.040]
And so in 1952, the first ever zero calorie soda was born and produced at the company's

[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.880]
plant in College Point, Queens, New York.

[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.580]
A soft drink without sugar was novelty at the time.

[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.100]
No cowl became renowned for special flavors like chocolate,

[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.820]
often mixed with a splash of milk by loyal users.

[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.360]
Black cherry, great with baked apples, ginger ale and root beer.

[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.520]
I bet you won't find out about that on the Jimmy Cifillitic show.

[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:18.240]
Oh, Neil!

[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.820]
You're listening to Neil Rogers.

[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:20.980]
Well, here we go again.

[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.140]
I'm on some sort of 24 years later.

[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.420]
560 Q-A-E.

[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:27.800]
Oh, 72 is a 7-A-Longer Show.

[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.440]
They're going.

[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:30.600]
This is the brain.

[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:31.180]
Yep.

[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.580]
Any questions?

[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.360]
There to my 43.

[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.420]
There are the streets fighting cry.

[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.160]
They 524.

[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:46.660]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.140]
In Halendale by 20s.

[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.000]
We got a problem.

[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.100]
The grey gang is at the early tricks.

[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:58.920]
Lieutenant, isn't that the group of senior citizens who went around trying to get the early bird special after 7-17?

[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:01.140]
Let's go get them.

[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.240]
They'll stop at nothing and clean up the streets.

[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.100]
Hey, lady, you can't cross.

[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.700]
Here you'll have to cross in the light.

[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.020]
They're determined to clean up the smugging distance.

[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.360]
All right, sister, you're under arrest.

[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.460]
Oh, so now you're arresting my wife. Watch the charge.

[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.780]
Session to powder.

[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.380]
I'm going to first tell you that white stuff.

[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.020]
Yeah, just a thought.

[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.200]
Got over 100 bags in here.

[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.440]
Overworked.

[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.080]
Sweet and low.

[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.320]
From that restaurant, she just came out of.

[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:30.420]
Let's take a minute.

[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.600]
Yes, there comes the in-bite cops.

[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:36.020]
On a hot new beat.

[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.000]
In Halendale by.

[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:41.540]
Premearing this fall on MBC.

[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.860]
16 certificates left for the field and they'll be gone pretty soon.

[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:47.200]
We sold 84, like about a minute.

[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:47.920]
Yep.

[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:52.620]
And of course, we would have done it noon, which is the ordinary regular time and not cut everybody off balance.

[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:53.560]
Now there's only 12.

[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.640]
They would have all been gone by now, but now there's a dozen left. They'll be gone.

[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.640]
And what's the gun that's gone?

[00:44:59.060 --> 00:44:59.860]
Where's your food there yet?

[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:00.800]
The food is here.

[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.080]
There's setting up in the kitchen and everything.

[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:02.420]
Excellent.

[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.460]
All right.

[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.440]
So that's perfect because that means you can eat and then fly.

[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.360]
Eat and fly.

[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:08.820]
That was up 92 points.

[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:10.980]
Where do you made off fleets guilty?

[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.160]
They're going to fry his ass.

[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.160]
Are they out of fry it?

[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:16.880]
What they had to do was chop it off and just fry his ass separate.

[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.140]
Now the three certificates left for the field.

[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:20.740]
How do you like that?

[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.680]
And next time I refresh it, they'll be gone.

[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:29.360]
Now the reason I played Halendale fights is yesterday I threatened to read this thing that somebody said it's story from 100 years ago.

[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.160]
I don't remember whether this was from the hair older.

[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.020]
They scum sentin' all or where it was from.

[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.480]
Does it make a difference?

[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:36.980]
No.

[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:38.780]
Halendale.

[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.500]
For weeks now, it's been Neil Rogers.

[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:46.060]
One of South Florida's most popular and vitriolic radio talk show hosts versus the old people of Halendale.

[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.260]
And I'm an old people and I still can't withstand that crowd.

[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:49.880]
They're all dead.

[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:57.220]
Rogers 44 has referred to the senior citizens of that city as, on the areas they living dead, the condo comatose and real prunes.

[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:02.300]
He's made fun of the early bird restaurant specials they patronize and mocked away they cross the street.

[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:07.780]
The old people of Halendale in response to threatened to ask advertisers to stop patronizing his radio station,

[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:13.340]
city manager RJ Intendola 36 said Rogers has the personality of all the seven dwarfs wrapped into one.

[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.020]
Whatever that means.

[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:15.680]
Sold out.

[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:16.940]
Sold out.

[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:17.480]
All right.

[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.580]
Total three minutes or less.

[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.980]
And even though we had the through everybody off with a goofy time.

[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.980]
See, I totally eleven o'clock would be the way to do it.

[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:26.580]
Did I tell you that?

[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:27.020]
Yeah.

[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.140]
You're talking me out today, man.

[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.340]
George, Barnett.

[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.380]
And now what did they bring you?

[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:32.440]
Oh, everything.

[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:36.440]
I got some corn beef over here, some of the potatoes soup, which I insisted on.

[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:36.660]
Mm.

[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.020]
Uh, cabbage, corn beef and cabbage.

[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:39.440]
What's this?

[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:40.720]
Like a sausage pastry?

[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.720]
The sausage puff pastry.

[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.120]
I live off of those things.

[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:44.840]
All right.

[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:45.460]
Excellent.

[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:46.740]
Well, enjoy while I'm reading this.

[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.120]
I'm going to be living in the past on a sold halendale.

[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:54.980]
Back and forth it went until Saturday when Rogers and Mova Kindle the Iotola Comanese going to a Jimmy Carter arena.

[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:59.400]
Wiener roast broadcasts radio talk show live from the diplomat mall in where else Halendale?

[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.600]
80 year old Betty Elkins, small but powerful.

[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.240]
Elbowed her way through the throng.

[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.880]
There were several hundred people milling about the talk show set.

[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.080]
Some folks yelled at Rogers.

[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.260]
She's alive one.

[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.260]
We've got a live one here.

[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.800]
Mrs. Elkin was not deterred.

[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:19.400]
Jabbing her finger at the bald and corpulent talk show host, she proceeded to launch into an invective as last remaining as anything Rogers has ever said.

[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.960]
I hope you never lived to be a senior citizen.

[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:22.580]
She's spotted.

[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.540]
And guess what?

[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:26.200]
I'm living as a senior citizen now and she's dead.

[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.180]
You can be sure that.

[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.460]
She was 80 then.

[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:30.060]
She's dead.

[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.240]
Rogers looked taken aback.

[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:33.800]
A female fan quickly jumped to his defense.

[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.480]
Why don't you turn him off if you don't like him?

[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.300]
She has Mrs. Elkin.

[00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:37.460]
Mrs. Elkin replied,

[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.200]
if we don't listen to him, how do we know what he's saying against us?

[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:41.180]
He's a barbarian.

[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:42.900]
He's a barbarian.

[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:47.280]
Halendale is the city of 40,000 people, 60,000 during the winter season.

[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.680]
There are many banks, many condominiums, good shopping, a racetrack, a relatively low crime rate.

[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.120]
The average age is 63.

[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:59.740]
Rogers, Wienes, East Nasty, Neal or Uncle Neal consistently draws among the highest ratings on South Florida radio.

[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:05.620]
This despite the fact that he's a self-eviled Jewish atheist homosexual who thrives on radio by picking its source objects.

[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:09.540]
Reagan, organized religion, immigration of all felt his scathing monologues.

[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:13.680]
The way Rogers tells it, he started talking about Halendale's elderly only as a joke.

[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.520]
He played a takeoff of Miami Vice.

[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:20.060]
It's called Halendale Vice, to cops or after old people carrying the white powder sweet and low.

[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.340]
Very funny, what started as a joke quickly became serious.

[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:26.260]
It was Neal Rogers versus the city of Halendale, young versus old.

[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.100]
Every day, callers would complain on Rogers show about the elderly in Halendale.

[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:34.800]
They were careless, walking heedlessly in the middle of the street, waving their canes menacingly at motorists.

[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.660]
They were cheap, cramming the restaurants for the early bird specials. They were rude.

[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.680]
Rogers broadcast another song, this one of the tuna Jimmy Buffett's wasting Wasting Way in Halendale.

[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.880]
Played that yesterday, might play it again today, it's four minutes long.

[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:50.000]
So you think?

[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:51.000]
Go ahead!

[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.140]
At Halendale City Hall complaints about Rogers flooded in.

[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:58.480]
There was praise too, mostly from shopkeepers and restaurant tours, who thought Rogers was good for business.

[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.080]
After all, Halendale was being shown on TV and written up in national newspapers.

[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:04.360]
But the prevailing sentiment was outraged.

[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.560]
Rogers was an anti-old, a sociopath, just plain mean.

[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:11.540]
That's me, just as Johnny Dork and Greg Bidale-L-Tedia, am mean.

[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.260]
Halendale politician, Dordard of the City Manager, member of a country western band,

[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:19.560]
the composer-song defending the city. They started talking tough.

[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:23.660]
Maybe as some of their constituents wanted, they would urge advertisers to boycott Rogers show.

[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:29.040]
Then the diplomat, Maul, invited Rogers to appear and Rogers haven't created so much controversy agreed to come on Saturday.

[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:34.700]
He brought two cans of soda, medicated douche, symbolic of a term he uses to describe old people,

[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.420]
and two security guards hired by the station to look after his safety.

[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.380]
City officials had received warnings from people angry enough to clobber him.

[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.140]
Not as angry as Stormy, but almost.

[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:47.600]
He attracted a crowd that included young and old fans, indie tractors.

[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:51.020]
The fans, all ages, were told to wear red shirts.

[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:53.280]
The foes many of them older linked to the city were yellow.

[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.040]
There was nearly a disturbance when city officials passed out yellow caps.

[00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.360]
There was nearly a disturbance when Mrs. Elken confronted Rogers.

[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.660]
No violence occurred, though.

[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:05.800]
Rogers' mother, Milnerdby Health, for 73, was there. She gave her son a big kiss.

[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.100]
City manager, Intendola, was there too. He defended the city on the year.

[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:14.840]
Helen Dale and Vice Mayor Arthur J. Sonny Rosenberg referred to Rogers as a version of Senator Joe McCarthy,

[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.380]
except he doesn't have any power.

[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:20.960]
He just has a big mouth, Rosenberg said. He engaged the talk show host before the show.

[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.980]
I'm 67. I'm in better shape than he is, Rosenberg yelled.

[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:25.880]
I wonder if he said that or alive.

[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:29.220]
This is 22 years ago, he'd be 89 now.

[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.640]
Rogers yelled back, terrific physically, but not mentally.

[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.920]
Then Rosenberg commented on the crowd. They don't live in Helen Dale.

[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.680]
Michael Goldowitz, 70, hearing it all concluded that Rogers was a man to dislike.

[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:47.320]
We are survivors of the concentration camps. He said the way he conducts himself is like Hitler.

[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.860]
But Abe Zama, 76, found Rogers charming. Half of them here are all morons.

[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:55.520]
He said because they don't know what they're doing. They don't like him because he's telling the truth.

[00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:00.060]
Amen. Amen to that. Seems like only yesterday.

[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:01.380]
Now it seems like a hundred years ago.

[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:05.900]
I'll be all the answer.

[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:10.620]
It wasn't Helen Dale. It was so angry and so whipped up and so yaddy yaddy yaddy.

[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:14.380]
Like the one old Cocker said, they didn't like it because it was the truth.

[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:17.140]
It was the freaking truth. So we sold out with the.

[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:21.360]
Huh? Excellent. Good job guys. Thank you.

[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.000]
And the food I'm sure is sensation.

[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:29.480]
Oh my God. I think what we'll do is we'll do this break a little just a tad early because we only got to eleven like, you know.

[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:34.440]
For those of you looking for a good reason to tune out other than maybe you don't like to show.

[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:37.620]
The other good reason is that we got the Keynes pregame show at 11.30 this morning.

[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:38.820]
Oh God.

[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:41.300]
All right.

[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:46.280]
I'm dying. I'm dying. I'm dying. I'm dying over here.

[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.060]
Coming up cheesecake.

[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.960]
Smaking and eating shake.

[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:03.020]
All of the old folks are with them all.

[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:09.760]
The check in the CDs.

[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:14.260]
No, they never say please.

[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:19.640]
Just waiting for the early bird special to come.

[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:28.600]
The wasting weekend good old happy.

[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:36.620]
Searching for the boss teeth they left and I've left.

[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.160]
It's official. We sold out to field in nine minutes.

[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.660]
Count him Robert. Yeah.

[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:47.160]
And how dare they claim that there's a talk host to play.

[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:53.920]
Girl, what they know is their own damn phone.

[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:10.560]
A shudder in life to get the early bird on time.

[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:16.200]
Boy, they're pushing just as hard as they can.

[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:27.040]
And once they are seated, they get overheated.

[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:33.000]
It's not stuff in rows and sweeten low in their bed.

[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:41.540]
Boy, wasting away a can in good old happy.

[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.620]
Do do do do.

[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.960]
Do you think they do?

[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:59.780]
How did they say it's a bullet through the day?

[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:05.880]
But for some. And anyone in the blues.

[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:07.600]
Absolutely.

[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:17.340]
Your folks don't know the reason why nothing is pleasing.

[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:23.100]
The muscles ache and the teeth just don't fit.

[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:33.840]
What doesn't matter when they call up kneeling chatter.

[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:35.080]
You're fair.

[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:42.080]
I hate you kneeling never listen to your shudder.

[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:48.320]
They're wasting away a can in good old happy.

[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:56.360]
Just to fuck the metal music and the radio.

[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:06.660]
And how did they claim that it's the dark host to play?

[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:08.780]
But new notes.

[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:14.420]
They can't wait for your shudder.

[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:22.780]
And how did they claim that it's the dark host to play?

[00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:25.320]
Oh, but new notes.

[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:31.760]
They just can't wait for your shudder.

[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:32.960]
And animal in the blues.

[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:35.120]
Oh my god, what a great combination.

[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:36.500]
That's like what was it?

[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:37.600]
Expression you use.

[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.660]
Quiet desperation.

[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:42.000]
Oh, living a life of quiet desperation.

[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.340]
That's us here at QAM.

[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:48.080]
We're living a life of quiet desperation.

[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:52.980]
1116, we got 14 minutes away from that basketball game.

[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:55.840]
And pregame show you and somebody, Virginia Tech.

[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:58.000]
That would really be great.

[00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:59.540]
Pregame show at 1130.

[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:00.500]
Oh, yes.

[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:01.460]
No, yeah.

[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:03.960]
And then if the McCain's win, then we repeat tomorrow.

[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:04.620]
It's gonna replay.

[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:05.980]
We'll get out of here 1130 again.

[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:06.540]
Go, okay.

[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:08.680]
And you imagine how much extra I can lose these two days?

[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:09.080]
Yeah.

[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:13.700]
And it's all the way up to a toasty minus six today.

[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:15.880]
Boy, I'll tell you where the hell is spring already here?

[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:18.860]
One thing about the weather up north is sucks.

[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.300]
I'm not gonna lie to you about that.

[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:22.000]
I'm gonna say, oh, well, you know, it sucks.

[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:23.020]
It's too cold.

[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.800]
Windy, nasty, brutal.

[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:27.860]
We have weather and traffic on our screen all the time.

[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:28.540]
Well, that's good.

[00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:31.220]
Here's the way to pull shaping up right now.

[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:35.120]
When I was a child, the first adult I had a crush on was a teacher 155.

[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.920]
That's winning hands down your pants.

[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:37.180]
Yeah.

[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.900]
And these days, a lot of teachers put in hands down, a lot of pants.

[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:40.900]
Boy.

[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:41.660]
TV, what?

[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.580]
How come it didn't happen to me?

[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:44.320]
No.

[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:53.360]
TV or film star 94, like Wes Morgan and Luke Halpin, those people, and Sabu, the Indian boy.

[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.760]
How can I remember that?

[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.360]
I don't even know if there was really such a person.

[00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:58.580]
What?

[00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:58.860]
Of course.

[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.280]
He used to ride around naked on that elephant.

[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:01.640]
Yep.

[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.520]
Dranked himself to death.

[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:04.680]
He did?

[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:05.180]
Mm-hmm.

[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:08.600]
What was he drinking that Indian, that cow pee?

[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:09.220]
Probably.

[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:10.260]
With booze.

[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:14.840]
Sabu, the Indian boy, was mixing cow pee with the vodka and a metal wicked end.

[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:16.920]
And here he had a wicked end.

[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.280]
I never had a childhood crush on an adult 54.

[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:20.260]
Well, that's unfortunate.

[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:23.260]
Neighbor 46, babysitter 32.

[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:27.600]
Friends parent 23, family member 15, Playboy model 12.

[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.000]
Clergy member 5.

[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.260]
A member of the clergy.

[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.180]
A father.

[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:36.780]
Coats 3, parents friend 1, athlete 1, only 1?

[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:39.860]
Are you kidding me?

[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.220]
I had the hots for Mickey Mantle.

[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:41.700]
I'll tell you that.

[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:42.240]
I'll tell you that.

[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.620]
Hey, Mick, he's dead now.

[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.260]
Drunken dead.

[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:46.200]
You got an extra liver for the Mick?

[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:49.780]
School bus driver 1, and present or doctor or nurse none.

[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:51.540]
I see.

[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:56.200]
Police sees 1200 pounds of pot in spinach cans.

[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.360]
See, George, if you just, I know you don't like those.

[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.400]
You don't like your broccoli and califar.

[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:03.620]
How do you like spinach, either?

[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:04.320]
Correct.

[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:04.860]
Raw?

[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:05.320]
Yes.

[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.080]
No.

[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.100]
You like it raw?

[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:07.600]
Yeah.

[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:08.580]
What about the spinach?

[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:09.260]
That too.

[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.860]
Police with the New Mexico Motor Transportation Division found

[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:17.400]
1200 pounds of pot packed in cans labeled as spinach during a stop at the Gallup Port of Entry.

[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:23.780]
An inspector noticed that only a few of the cans were labeled and that the weight printed on the side of the can didn't match the actual weight.

[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:29.960]
A closer look during last Friday's bus revealed the canned drugs which were worth an estimated $1.5 million.

[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.160]
The four pallets of cans are being transported along with fresh produce.

[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:38.280]
The 50-year-old truck driver said he was on his way from California to the East Coast.

[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:41.060]
The driver and the pot were turned over to the DEA.

[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.860]
Oh, Antonio.

[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:49.940]
Tony and West Kendall said, this came in yesterday afternoon.

[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.160]
I don't want to leave any stones unturned.

[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.600]
If you catch my drift, he drifted.

[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.340]
He says, I see that Rupert Chuchu is continuing to hassle George.

[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:00.240]
Well, let me at least offset his latest attack.

[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:03.060]
George does a very good job as a co-host and as a host.

[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:05.320]
Your show to me is very entertaining and more important.

[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:08.280]
It's free. That's right. The price is right. If you don't like it, you mama.

[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:11.140]
I suggest to Chuchu if you don't like the program switch.

[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:15.300]
You can always listen to the history of Glenn Beck and his hyperbole of what the future is going to bring.

[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:20.060]
Neil and George keep up the great job both of you are doing because you're smoking everyone else.

[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:21.540]
You're smoking.

[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.160]
Saludos to George and you, Tony West Kendall.

[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:25.320]
You're smoking, I'm not.

[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.480]
You know, I really, it really breaks my heart that I can't smoke an ice or even a bad stogie once in a while.

[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:34.680]
I can't do it. Okay. Good. Well, no, I had those two mini strokes.

[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:38.660]
Those two T.I.s and both times after I was smoking them little little cigars, you know.

[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:41.160]
Yeah. I think it's just not good.

[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:43.800]
Cigars in me are just not cut off for each other.

[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:47.440]
If you catch my drift, catch my catch it. Yeah, I caught it.

[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:48.760]
I just don't think I can do it.

[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:53.600]
I mean, I scream, I survive eating all that crap. You know, I don't know how the hell I do it.

[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:57.900]
Avi says, love the show. You are great and so is George.

[00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:01.040]
Canada Dry makes a diet cranberry gingerbread. It's great. By the way, I've had it.

[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.220]
It's great. You're right. It tastes like gingerbread with a bit of cranberry juice.

[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.980]
They sell it in grocery stores here in Miami. I assume you can find Canada Dry in Canada.

[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:13.520]
Oh, no. Wouldn't that be bad if you couldn't find Canada Dry in Canada?

[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:18.240]
The real Rocky says WTF question. Marquins basketball right in the middle of the show.

[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.380]
You got it. Rocky coming up very soon.

[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:21.600]
Shortly.

[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.500]
Well, here we go.

[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.120]
Up to you, up.

[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.160]
Later.

[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.240]
560 Q A M.

[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:30.780]
NEO.

[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.040]
Yeah.

[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:35.560]
What the hell was that?

[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.680]
I love me, man.

[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.180]
I need a friend.

[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:49.600]
I would hide all gently when I'm cute when you're at.

[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.640]
Welcome.

[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:59.020]
With the sharp eyes when she fly our sides we reclaim George as you see.

[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:04.640]
It's a legal drug or according to you.

[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.740]
The good old I will see.

[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:10.100]
Oh, right.

[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:13.860]
The day the tree.

[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.360]
Curious and free.

[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:27.560]
Oh, can it best be that that's born to me?

[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:37.500]
Oh, can it best be that's born to me?

[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.840]
Oh, the 27 Q A M.

[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.540]
So we got the pregame show coming up.

[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.800]
Is this the beast and Joe's a gacka gacka gacka gacka?

[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:46.760]
Oh, no.

[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:47.460]
Oh, we don't know.

[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.760]
So you'll have to stay tuned.

[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.520]
Stay on the edge of your seats to find out.

[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.640]
Now, do you ever figure out what that was that we just, uh,

[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:54.380]
that came up on there?

[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.060]
Was that like a.

[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:57.980]
Well, obviously you know this thing is automatically programmed.

[01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:58.740]
I see.

[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:03.220]
And I don't know why that came up next and I don't know why it played.

[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:03.880]
But it did.

[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:07.580]
Well, this too, she'll pass.

[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:08.260]
Mm-hmm.

[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.800]
Oh, that's not seat.

[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:11.320]
Look at that.

[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:13.660]
I told you that thing keeps you reprogramming yourself.

[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:14.640]
It really works if you heard.

[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:16.000]
Yeah, here we go.

[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.060]
We don't want to hear it.

[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.320]
Canes basketball coming up next and if they win,

[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:21.580]
we do the same thing again tomorrow.

[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:24.520]
Four Canes, baby, around.

[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.500]
Jungle Keynes.
