[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.960]
Somewhere along the line

[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.300]
Things are not fine on the line

[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.420]
Boy it's going to be

[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.000]
Not good I'm

[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.200]
I think I'm going to sue somebody

[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.740]
Because I'm probably going to get like cancer

[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.660]
The hero from having a cell

[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.900]

By the way on this new pole

[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.000]

Oh my god

[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.040]
Was she a piece of worker what

[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.720]
What I remember the day I told her I was not

[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.180]
The re-upping with packs and I was coming to qa and she stood there

[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.040]
She and peony bolder in the office

[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.860]
She stood there tapping her foot like like somehow tapping her foot was going to change the reality

[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.100]
But that was up 154 points

[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.840]
Wow

[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.980]
I can still see that I forgot my tv going

[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.240]
Good

[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.020]
There's one

[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.200]
What happened here I mean what what is this one

[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.800]
I don't know I mean it was all

[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.100]
Among your technical experts forgive me I guess

[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.460]
Oh there's a lot of miles between us over here

[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.780]
So who knows maybe a pigeon craft on something somewhere

[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.800]
I think a pigeon craft on our phone line

[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.160]
Yeah

[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.200]
Well

[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.960]
I don't

[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.460]
So I can't play any bits or

[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.260]
No I guess I'll do that and you'll just make sounds with your mouth

[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.020]
Or I could make sounds with my ass I can go take it if I had to

[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.760]
I don't need to but I could go take a choice and take this in there with me

[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.020]
There you go that that would be really

[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.480]
We want it a wireless microphone for a long time now and now we have it you can know

[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.020]
Wait wait wait go to the chinese market I want to hear what that

[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.120]
No speaking was chinese like it sounds like

[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.980]
Yeah

[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.440]
Yeah

[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.840]
I can go up and knock those doors now

[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.080]
My boy you just hand her the phone and and I'll take it in there

[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.600]
Screaming and yelling will make a new chinese restaurant bit of it

[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.880]
Let's see what I got here okay see this is what's good about not taking calls

[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.840]
Although you could take the calls on your end couldn't you

[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.840]
I'm not taking it okay

[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.420]
I could but I'm already you know I would have to do some weird things because you're on the phone so

[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.180]
Oh

[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.560]
Yeah, but yeah, I know you you do have the audio vault and the phone computer are the same computer so

[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.140]
Yes

[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.700]
If you think we're having technical issues now

[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.200]
Well, what does that mean when you play the switch back and forth continuously so that I can play spots and take calls and or take calls

[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.080]
No, we're not so what does that mean when when you play the spots

[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.300]
I'm not going to hear it no no you'll hear everything

[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.620]
It's just they're on the same computer so I just have to be switching computer functions constantly

[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.700]
Oh just relax we get so hyper mic

[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.100]
God

[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.600]
I

[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.780]
Anyway, here's let's see oh

[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.820]
This remember what I said the other day about them

[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:29.560]
On the year tryouts and how that's the worst form of desperation and on air auditions the worst the worst well

[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.020]
Guess who hosted the morning show on the ticket today not coming at you but they're the month

[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.000]
Dave Le Mans the farting Dave Le Mans. Yes, John and for a lot of deals is are these on air auditions? What do you think John?

[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.980]
Of course they are says I wonder if they had a large kind of gladiness food in case they broke into a farting spell

[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.700]
Ask John and for a lot of day. Well, I don't know and I really don't care John don't worry about them because they're

[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.520]
floundering floundering

[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.220]
Grasping for straws one day. It's jerks the next day. It's it all the out-of-work people are gonna be over there auditioning for that morning show

[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.260]
When you think that if they were like a real operation which they're not but when you think if they were

[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.080]
They would have their ducks in a row before they left

[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.640]
Yeah, right. Yeah, I got a lot

[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.980]
What huh?

[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.360]
I said like us oh like us

[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.880]
Oh, I think it's something nasty. I did that was up 157 points see this this business

[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.580]
Oh the pole is down momentarily while Eric takes that stupid thing over what is the cell phone and out's back up nice work Eric

[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.220]
Thank you. He's the best

[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.640]
We had him in charge of whatever this technical amal function at the junction is we'd be back on normal like you know

[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.700]
Like ordinary, but we're not how much I'm watching those lights

[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.420]
Yeah, this is a long time. This is um right

[00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.820]
Well, I got all the doors open and I see you know like Timmy running back and forth every now and again, but good luck to us

[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.060]
And what is he doing?

[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.020]
Everything that he can and it might not be here in the building might be the line

[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.180]
It's I'm not the way it looks to me is like it's the line right

[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.620]
Like they got to call AT&T again like they've had to do before what is this like the fifth time just uh in a year

[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.020]
I think I might have to join here soon. I might go in there and uh take

[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:29.020]
With that no, that's what I'm saying that would be the greatest of all time because I wouldn't even tell you um put it on speaker phone

[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.820]
And I'm not one of those people who grunts and groans when I sit on the throne. We know fun

[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.480]
I never I never understood that

[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.000]
Well that depends on the circumstances you understand you go into a public key room and then you go

[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.080]
Yeah, I told you I was in the this room over. I don't know who it was that was in the stall, but it sounded like they were getting off

[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.700]
Oh, yeah, I was it was very scary. Maybe they were it sounded like they were having a really good time

[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.960]
Too good a time. Yeah, maybe they were

[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.180]
Who is the sales guy?

[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.980]
Would you used to work for us the chronic masturbator? What was his name?

[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.060]
I don't know

[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.400]
Do you remember those at iod I remember rumors of one, but I don't know how to do it if you are here

[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.640]
Yeah

[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.180]
No, I don't know that why am I hearing myself back a second time? Oh now it stopped

[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.520]
I it all didn't because I were on the phone and there's a delay

[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.900]
Overdoubted up 154. I just parted real bad. I could have put this phone right by my ass. That would have been great

[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.520]
He did a lot of advantages of doing the show on this on the up crackberry. Yeah

[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.320]
Get get a headset

[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.580]
A headset for what the crackberry? Yeah, that way you can get both your hands free

[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.380]
So you can pick your ass and talk at the same time

[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.980]
So all in bokeh is an idiot

[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.880]
So many idiot boy that thought was rank oh

[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:55.640]
Oh

[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.380]
That yeah

[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.540]
Yes, whoonin whoa

[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:09.180]
I could only have that one in the shower this morning would have been a mafaya should have bottled it for later maybe get a balloon

[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.620]
Paul says I'm confused because when I voted Tuesday for Richard Simmons

[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:19.200]
He was at the top of the pole and now his name is vanished my question to you sir is why sir

[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:28.440]
Because I had Eric take it off of there because Paul is obviously a screaming or whoever the hell he's talking about Richard Simmons a screaming

[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:35.620]
Missing bag. It didn't tie him with the question of the pole the pole question is somebody who's in the closet who isn't

[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.940]
Obviously a screamer that that was the pole question

[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.260]
Richard Simmons was like putting Charles Nelson right on there. I mean just just silly

[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.440]
We're like putting out some John on there

[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.380]
So that's the answer Paul sir

[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.440]
Okay, here's the result of the poll

[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.200]
This is not the out of the house. Did you just take a bonehead?

[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.600]
Who you

[00:08:59.300 --> 00:08:59.540]
No

[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.380]
Sounds like you were

[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.540]
Yeah sucking on a water pipe

[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.120]
Yeah, I was

[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.500]
I'm not

[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.640]
Well you were relaxing up to start farting

[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.920]
I guess it was started by Dave Lamont being on this morning across the street

[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.940]
Boy he used to fart the most wicked. Oh

[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.700]
And I'm trying to do a ballgame and he said and they're just farting up the storm

[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:34.320]
Anyway of the following home would you least be surprised to learn in some of sexual or lesbian?

[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.760]
You know, I remember when we had the big power figure in the northeast member

[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:44.400]
Yes, and I did a whole show for my living room on that but that was on the my regular hard-line phone. Yeah

[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.200]
I've never done it from in here. Of course. I'm gonna have to do it in here because otherwise I can't get the emails

[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.280]
You know correct. I'm sure they're pouring in. Let me take a look right now. I'm sure pouring in oh there are they are

[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.980]
Brandon says you sound like hell on the phone, but it's not the first time you've had to do this

[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.660]
Right, it was the one other time. I remember we're doing the entire show on the phone

[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.760]
I suggest getting your vet and go to woodbind or how about this you were saying to the day that it's been eon since you had

[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.420]
Last had a drop from a car. Well now you can make your own. Yeah, I'm gonna make a drop here. I think

[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.600]
That's what you keep threatening

[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.500]
We're not sports in a 940 somebody sends me the time jicke outcome that I read on the year the other day very sad

[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.140]
Oh

[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.200]
Phil Arck you sound like crap and the show is not up to its usual standards

[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.260]
I think he should take more precautions so it doesn't happen again

[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.860]
Get them on this right away just kidding, but seriously you sound like she out as the bridge say well too bad

[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.840]
Yeah, it really sound bad. It sounds like you're on the phone and underwater

[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:45.320]
Lauren says I didn't realize Neil was up on the space station today come to think of it. They had a better connection well good for them

[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.960]
Good for them. At least I'm here trying to do a show. Right. I couldn't just enjoy what you do

[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.520]
And I'm gonna get the car and go to woodbine. I'm gonna go back to bed. You know, I could do that and look

[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.940]
Hey, you're making their day. You're giving them something to bitch about

[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:05.520]
Mortars and gamesville rejected the politics of fear yesterday and bigotry by 58 to 42 percent margin Fred

[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.580]
Souther sends it

[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.340]
Charter amendment one went down and flames in the city election yesterday in gamesville

[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.720]
Retaining games those reputation has been one of the most progressive cities in Florida

[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:19.340]
Especially when it's surrounded by a bunch of crimson red counties here in aintry or north central florida says Fred

[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.360]
Thanks again for mentioning you on the air proud of its adopted town. They says Fred Souther

[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.260]
That's what Fred says

[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:33.000]
All right, thank you Fred. Oh and Brandon says are you doing the show from a cell or landline you come and clear on a landline

[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.500]
I can't do it on the landline because it's in the other room

[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.940]
I have nowhere to plug it into in here and

[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.840]
It's we're doing what we're doing so all you worked out there including you Brandon

[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.500]
Oh my god

[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.800]
It sounds

[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:54.000]
Different but we can hear every word that you're saying so it's not like it's distorted run intelligible or anything like that

[00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.700]
So oh it's speaking of

[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.240]
Branden says I had the same thing happened to me. I was in the stall at bcc one day when I was still going to school

[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.720]
I heard this guy come in. I heard some rather loud grunts afterward

[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.840]
I heard the sound you normally would hear when your hand is well greased and working and then he vanished

[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:15.900]
No

[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.420]
Oh, well, we'll get back to this magnet. Sure

[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:31.200]
Or no or not. I never did get the appore's. Well, we'll get to that. No rush today take our time. That was up 163 point

[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.700]
Still two reliance and one red line

[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.280]
Okay, and and I'm not going to be able to play the anything you know anything. I'll play something

[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.100]
I mean the cue you know the other thing

[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.180]
Don't worry about it. Oh, we just won't have that and uh and I'll play a bit coming out. How's that?

[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:50.520]
great

[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.560]
Everybody needs a fear especially me

[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.340]
Not a good idea to appear like a missing queen

[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:19.880]
Essentially a peasy what the breeder spear by pretending that I'm not a queer

[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.820]
No, it will ever know that I'm a homo

[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.560]
They'll just say he's married you know

[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.060]
Holden back my passion for sports to now and then

[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.000]
Faking I like women for then watching men

[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.300]
I've got a bit but inside I'm tired

[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:54.760]
Living alive that nobody's buying now I gotta live a life and act apart

[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.720]
But it's been that in me

[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:04.980]
I don't have the balls to admit I play shin fall

[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.820]
I don't have the balls to admit I play shin fall

[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.620]
I don't have the balls to admit I play shin fall

[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.600]
I just don't have the balls to admit I play shin fall

[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.440]
Well, you're close personal friend Brandon had a really a good suggestion

[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:32.420]
Yeah

[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:39.400]
Which is only partially working it won't work at the moment because you said don't you have a portable phone at the ties into your landline

[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.500]
And I sure do I never use it

[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.020]
And so it's not charged up. Ah

[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.020]
So I just plugged it in in my living room and I

[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:54.640]
And I put the other thing on the to charge up on a cradle the hand that rocks the cradle and I stuck the phone line into it

[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:54.980]
So

[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:02.520]
When I think it's charged it depending on how long this problem goes on I can call you back on there and maybe it'll sound better maybe

[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.100]
It's a sanyo. I haven't used that thing in ages

[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:11.460]
Because it's a piece of crap so the probably sound worth the nith but but we can try it

[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.780]
Okay, because the lights are still out. Yeah

[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:22.680]
Are you getting any progress before? No, I just just did a a search during that break and he doesn't know where Timmy is

[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.740]
I mean, you know, it might be in the basement or something

[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.960]
What are you saying

[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.460]
What language are you sticking?

[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:33.280]
Uh

[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:39.260]
Uzbekistanie we don't know where anyone is there's a big important meeting going on right now first of all

[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:45.960]
Well, what are you talking about where we can't get this thing on a ear and you're talking there's a big important meeting

[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.120]
More important to getting this thing fixed

[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.480]
I don't know where Timmy is or any engineer or what they're doing if they're doing anything

[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.580]
Running around in the hallway

[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.820]
He was

[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:57.960]
He was

[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.040]
That was when I when I told you that you know when I told you that he was running around in the hallways

[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.500]
That's yeah, that's when he was doing that all right as of this last break

[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.560]
We don't know where he is or what he's doing if he's doing something about it great and if he's not uh

[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.620]
Not so great

[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:18.320]
But we don't know nobody knows and everybody else in the building is in the people meter meeting that I wish I was in right now

[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:24.460]
Oh the people meter meeting. Oh my god. I just got a thing from the fake very jackass about that

[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.060]
As if we don't already know that my Amy is going ppm

[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:34.840]
I got some bad information about the ppm by the way a few days ago from very jackass about tanner is all upset about it

[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:40.060]
And everybody else is upset about it too. It's not accurate and it's a full of crap. Oh great wonderful

[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:44.640]
Kind of like the present arbitration is not accurate. It's full of crap when it's done. I'll have to say

[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:50.120]
Here's one that says all you have to do is install free instant messaging software on your computer

[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.200]
That supports voice such as Google talk or Skype

[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.540]
George could put up his computer and wouldn't say it would sound crystal clear now much different than the normal show

[00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.500]
Do you understand what that means?

[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.960]
Yeah, but you don't have a microphone uh

[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.140]
Hooked up to your computer. So no, so never mind

[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:06.460]
No

[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.840]
No, I do not you would have to have that so thanks for the suggestion

[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.160]
Thanks for the memories, but uh

[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:19.680]
Here's one it says oh man, this is golden. It sounds so funny through the phone sounds like you're hiding in that hole

[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.100]
They found Sodom in I am

[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.400]
I am I'm trying to get the aspires out of my ear. Oh

[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.640]
Here's a good one from me who's a real idiot. Can you give out your cell phone number so we can Twitter back and forth

[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.540]
Yeah, go Twitter on there are are are oh there's the picture that yellow cab again from Vancouver that you uh

[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.260]
So that that's a Prius. Yes, it is hybrid

[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.460]
It's a Prius hybrid

[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.320]
Because my cabbie I mentioned him yesterday and he was he knew all about it

[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.560]
He said they have two of them here in Toronto

[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.220]
Well, they well, why would they why would they have two they're just getting started

[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.920]
No, they've got more cabs here than then they've got population. It's scary

[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.500]
And all of them are crying nobody's doing any business because nobody's got any money

[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:10.500]
Although the dial is up and everything is uh everything is coming up roses. The dial is up 154 points

[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.340]
Here's one from your friend my anal chapstick

[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.420]
Just thanks I couldn't sleep last night all I could think of was the critters crawling around inside my pillow

[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:25.340]
I hope that dust mites aid your phone line. I'm sending termites to woodbite. Well, he's a little bit

[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.800]
surely don't blame me

[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.600]
Not me god

[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:35.140]
Dust mites and the bed bugs and all these creepy crawlies because god is a sadistic son of a bitch

[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.980]
Where he can't says you should do the show from woodbind today, you know, I could

[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:46.760]
Right that's a possibility although the problem isn't there certain areas where you lose the line inside the building there

[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.320]
You know

[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:54.120]
Not that I would care George has had too much airtime lately. He's he is everything wrong with Cuban Miami

[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:01.660]
He is a glorified board op who is too big for his riches give him a week off and let's please live in

[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.140]
Slyvin said the Larry the fake Larry King

[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.280]
Can't understand why you don't like those fake emails

[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.000]
Here's one from rocky

[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.160]
Evidently you didn't get the joe bell memo about more cutbacks the beastly

[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:22.140]
Can't afford to pay for the phone line that connects you from Toronto and you'll have to do the show from the phone from now on

[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:26.260]
They'll do anything to make sure you fail signs of real rocky. Yeah, that's true that part

[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:33.380]
This was working just fine before the show we were talking back and forth and beautiful crap and everything was and all of a sudden

[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.880]
Not even with a sound not even a pop or a click or nothing just all of a sudden neither one of us responding to each other

[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:45.420]
And I'm resetting over here and you're resetting over there. Nothing is changing

[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:53.900]
So if you're talking to me that Timmy is involved in this meeting while we're in I don't know where Timmy is is what I told you

[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.880]
Yeah, and there are no other engineers in the building

[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.180]
Well, why not

[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.320]
You know the answer to that question. I know because there never are

[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.500]
I'm sure here's the whole result from yesterday

[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.580]
Took almost a half an hour to get to this finally so that's good killing some valuable time

[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:16.840]
I mean if you think that four hours is long or nearly under the best circumstances. Yeah

[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:23.300]
This is really lame didn't when you bought that crackberry there wasn't a little headset in the box there

[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.960]
No, oh, I don't think so

[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.660]
Do you want me to go look? Well during the break

[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.580]
I get

[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.880]
I got no head

[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.700]
I don't have to wait for a break that's right you don't I can take the phone right with me

[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.100]
I'm in my little bathroom right now. I got two bathrooms here last couple phones

[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:51.280]
I bought had a little you know not a wireless but just the little wired you know your bud headset in there

[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.540]
Oh, let me see

[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.640]
Here's the box, but I've never bought a blackberry so I don't know what

[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.160]
Well, you better get with it mister you got my car

[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:06.380]
I'm sitting on my bed right now. Oh, you know what then I'm looking in here and I see all kinds of crap bed bugs

[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.760]
No, no, I'm talking about in the box. Oh, I don't see a headset though

[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.460]
Here's a plug. Yeah, there's another plug plug

[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:16.560]

[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:24.820]

[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.080]
It looks like a little one bud

[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.380]
I can touch my ear bud looks like a little bud

[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.900]
Okay, let me put the phone down for a second open this up. Okay, don't go away. All right

[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.460]
Go ahead open this little bag

[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.580]
Well, let me go back in the studio

[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.180]
Because I think I got a spot there. Yes

[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:17.160]
Well, see I know what's going on. I've been doing this a long time. Hey other people have melted down on both ends

[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.000]
Oh, they wouldn't yeah, they would have these other amateurs. Oh

[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.820]
All right, hold on while I'm oh, I'm getting way past the break. I know

[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:28.020]
All right, let me do the spot and then during the break I'll hook this up and then it's gonna sound really spiffy

[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.360]
Well, at least you'll have both your hands. You'll have your both hands

[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.500]
Three, I don't know what I'm gonna do with it making them stick them inside my ass. Yeah

[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.400]
I love eating nuts

[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:37.000]
woman

[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.580]
I believe I'm gonna win in a short time you may be a one

[00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:46.370]
He's a real

[00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:57.590]
And your whole finger that's up on the graphic

[00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:03.830]
Well, I guess if you win rule are you good for yourself

[00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.670]
Well, some you statistics now

[00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.150]
I'm picking random good big-white

[00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:20.410]
Got plenty experts just my tell you it's better to go and choose the nonsense or just guess that my piece

[00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.310]
What's the try

[00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.510]
You ain't done anything

[00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.890]
You're too busy feeling bracket

[00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:38.570]
When much badness comes around no more pulling around I gotta get back to work wrong with you get busy

[00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:47.510]
Okay, now how does this sound good it does actually a little better it does I gotta say

[00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.550]
Because I'm using the little mic

[00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.710]
And the headset with the woods. It's only got one earpiece not as good as a microphone

[00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:01.430]
But there's less like a fumbling sound effects. You know what I mean a millennia. Yeah

[00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:07.150]
Let's fumble nila. You know what you know what else I have to do. Oh, this is this is really

[00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:15.170]
phenomenal and a couple people suggested this to me which I can go ahead and hear flush the toilet for you. Please do you want to hear that yeah

[00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:18.430]
Can you hear it?

[00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.010]
Yeah, there's nothing in it just water

[00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:29.270]
Sorry, I think you should take a walk to the Chinese market. How long does it take you to get there and back? Can you do it in one segment? Oh?

[00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:29.490]
Yeah

[00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:34.010]
I think you should take advantage of a new format

[00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:38.410]
No, I gotta get the charger. I got an unplugged here for my bedroom

[00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:45.750]
And see if this cord is long enough to you. I hope so yeah, I have a limited number of outlets left here as you can imagine

[00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:46.070]
Right

[00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.990]
Huh, right?

[00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.690]
Well, you can imagine I've got every outlet

[00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.050]
So let me unplug this one lamp. Oh geez

[00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.430]
Sorry and plug my charger and because otherwise this is not going to last correct

[00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.010]
How come this won't plug in?

[00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:10.290]
I don't think oh there we go. Oh good

[00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.310]
Now let's see about my charger cord

[00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.390]
Oh, I'm all out of breath and let me plug it in and charge my

[00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:20.730]
Crackberry while I'm using it

[00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:22.870]
There we go there you go

[00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:26.650]
Still connected it's sitting down there with uh, yeah

[00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.070]
And and the other thing I'm going to have to do

[00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:33.210]
How long do you think it would take to charge up that

[00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.270]
Affordable flight? I really don't know

[00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:40.090]
Because I don't think there's anybody working out on that end or somebody would be telling you something there

[00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.390]
You know that meeting is too important. They don't care about this show

[00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:49.510]
I've got the doors both doors open so I can see the hallway from here and no one has walked past

[00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:53.690]
Not a fly not a person not a chicken has walked past that doorway

[00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:59.670]
Everyone is in that meeting and I don't know if the engineers any of them are among them

[00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:02.970]
Well

[00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:04.310]
Isn't this a fine kettle official?

[00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.030]
This is typical right

[00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:11.350]
Somebody you know something email or you know saying now you can really rip the bees

[00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:16.350]
This has nothing to do with QA and this is a phone company problem obviously the line is out probably most likely

[00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:22.650]
Which happens to anybody and everybody but the fact that there is nobody doing anything at least that we can tell at the moment

[00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.210]
Uh, then that's that damn

[00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.030]
Manastana

[00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:33.990]
Oh here you go. Holy or robin robinia says the show is not what I'm used to from you if the audio doesn't improve

[00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:36.970]
I'm gonna have to put on radio mom be our radio ritmo

[00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.250]
The signals are ready to difficult to get inside the highly a city hall building

[00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.590]
And now with you on a phone line. It's almost impossible

[00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:47.610]
Please be as responsive the problems as I am to the highly a citizenry see what the chariot races

[00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:55.470]
PSI plan to run for the Senate seats vacated by my friend and fellow republican melmartine is can I count on your vote and more importantly your financial support

[00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.830]

[00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.510]
Jackass

[00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:04.850]
Oh the Reverend Francis Guinan has been sentenced to four years in prison ordered to pay 99

[00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.810]
999 dollars and 99 cent restitution of this former church

[00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.470]
A parade of priests and other supporters pleaded with a judge for mercy this morning

[00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:17.510]
In the case of the second priest convicted of stealing from Adele Ray Beach Church. Oh

[00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:23.570]
Saying that Guinan has suffered enough for the three-year court case and spending the last month in jail

[00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:27.570]
His supporters pleaded for circuit judge christimarts to spare in prison time

[00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:33.130]
He's lost his identity as priest he's lost his canonical rights in the church said the Reverend Nicholas King

[00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.390]
Pastor norlando

[00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.950]
Nicholas King what about the Reverend Nicholas Queen?

[00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:39.590]
Oh my god

[00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:44.270]
This should have been handled internally could have been handled effectively and they could in other words

[00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.830]
They should have swept out of the carpet is what he's trying to say

[00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:52.010]
Hey goodness goes on and on I don't good don't got time for a but thank you anyway

[00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:58.570]

Surprise show speed

[00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:08.110]
It's sounding lovely not really through the radio again sounding lovely. Mm-hmm. Is it lovely?

[00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.170]
It is it's awesome. It's spectacular

[00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:16.370]
Have you ever seen these things? Yeah, I use them all the time. So little little tiny just a wire

[00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:17.690]
Right

[00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:22.430]
Just a like a wire with an earbud on one end and the mic hanging on it

[00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:25.630]
Cathedral right now. I have no idea what that means. You know what that means. No

[00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:32.230]
Tell George to bring some pre-staffed officers somebody with a phone number. You're gonna bring some pre-craft

[00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.990]
You know, they'll have the usual touch kits. No

[00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:37.530]
Boy, this is

[00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:45.310]
Well, no one could blame you for bailing on a day like today. You want me to leave? No, I don't. Are you kidding me?

[00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:47.150]
I'm just saying

[00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:51.810]
I'm not asking your permission. Hey, listen, I'll go ask someone in management

[00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:56.570]
Hey

[00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.890]
Hey, can you leave? Yeah, they didn't say you couldn't

[00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:04.150]
Well, what I'm doing just in case because I of course um, you know

[00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:09.650]
I'm trying to prepare for all the contingencies over here and one of them was your blackberry possibly dying or or that connection

[00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.350]
How it's charging, baby, right?

[00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.910]
I'm having Josh Cordis who's the only person that's still paying any attention to us

[00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.230]
Dub the the live is just in case

[00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:26.430]
In case one in case I leave in case you get tired of doing this crap and you bail

[00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:33.250]
Tired of doing what crap. I don't know what you're showing the phone in case you you think that it sounds too bad or awful

[00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.150]
Whatever at this headset if you would just told me at the beginning about the headset

[00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:44.110]
No, I never really thought there was one in there. I never I never do that because you know, anytime you buy any electrical thing

[00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:50.490]
Any any kind of anything like this. There's a whole bunch of stuff inside the box and usually don't even look at it

[00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:54.350]
I do I play with all of it. It's a perfect list. What you play with it

[00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:57.850]
I mean open everything up. What's this thing? What's that do? What is this for?

[00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.750]
It is interesting though that in the upper life-hand corner

[00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:09.930]
There's a different symbol now. But we're just connected. That's the headset symbol and the charging symbol ought to be lit up

[00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:10.930]
No, it's the

[00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.190]
I don't know the whole thing is a different now. Mm-hmm

[00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.990]
See you're doing a show on the phone symbol oh

[00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:24.250]
That's really sucks

[00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:31.070]
Here's one that says tell George to go out of the meeting left and know the stations problem George is too lazy since he's no George

[00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:36.630]
Know it's better than you go interrupt an important meeting all they care about in this place is their meeting all these people who think they know something

[00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:40.730]
Yeah, you know something I mean what I'm supposed to be doing because if I wasn't sitting here doing it

[00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.470]
There would be nothing there'd be dead air

[00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:46.730]
He's yeah, he's fat shut in dobal

[00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:50.450]
loser living with mommy

[00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.350]
Faker yeah, yeah

[00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.190]
Now do we want to try um

[00:30:55.190 --> 00:31:01.290]
Because I mean this all we got to do is hang up during the break and I'll call you back on the I don't know how long

[00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:05.430]
It's gonna take to charge up that cordless phone. Let me let me tell you something

[00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:08.590]
Tell me don't

[00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:12.570]
Don't ask it because as I tried to explain and you can't see it

[00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:20.970]
I have to I'm using the audio vault and the phone thing on the same computer and I have to switch between them to do one or the other to take a call

[00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:24.930]
I have to deactivate I do uh exit audio vault to you the phone

[00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:31.270]
That's what I had to do before to take your call that's why you're having such a hard time getting connected to me do it after the break when we come back

[00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:38.170]
Ah if you want I think this is fine right now. I don't know if we should mess with it. Okay if it sounds okay

[00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.350]
Yeah, I don't think it's gonna sound better on that other thing

[00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:43.610]
You're really uncomfortable with the this and you don't have a headset

[00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.850]
Uh-huh you won't have a headset with that other thing. Will you?

[00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:52.350]
No, no, how would I have a headset with a portable phone? They they had them for those two

[00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:58.470]
Although at least if nothing else. I've got the my portable phone all charged up if nothing else. I'll never use it

[00:31:59.250 --> 00:31:59.690]
ah

[00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:09.070]
I think we're in the Guinness Book of Records now that's the first sneeze ever done on a radio talk show done over a blackberry

[00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.710]
Could be certainly by the host

[00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.370]
With the most I think I'm gonna go flush the toilet again. Why do you do the break?

[00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:19.010]
Bye

[00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:24.250]
Michael Phelps. Yeah, take me back if you will to the party in South Carolina

[00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:29.890]
It's just a small group and we're just sitting around celebrating you know, I have to ask you were you smoking pot?

[00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:31.790]
I thought nothing went the best

[00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:35.790]
We live in a time right now where it seems we almost brace ourselves

[00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.970]
For heroes to disappoint us

[00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:40.490]
Why do you smile?

[00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:44.830]
It's just funny. How are you doing right now?

[00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:52.650]
Very high. Are you really? I'm gonna do it no matter what okay, which hand which takes us to our second part of the question steroids

[00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:53.150]
um

[00:32:54.310 --> 00:33:00.070]
That's four days a week. Was that make you swim faster if I'm able to get faster at the end of the year than obviously I'm doing something right

[00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:01.930]
cooking yeah

[00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:10.750]
Every day this has been since you were what 10 10 or 11? I think so every single day, you know, it's been pretty fun so far

[00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:18.670]
So I wanted people to know sort of the the background parts of of Michael Phelps. You might be young rambling a little bit. I don't know um maybe

[00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:28.110]
Yeah, maybe not wow the thousand up 189 point aren't you excited? Yeah, why not now somebody points out somebody with a phone number

[00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:33.370]
The same microphone headset you have plugged into your blackberry can be used as a microphone to plug into your computer

[00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:38.150]
If you did wish to go to the instant messaging route. I don't think it's going to be long enough

[00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:42.630]
I'm not gonna be long enough. I've heard that that chord

[00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:48.370]
Long enough to do what to be able to use that as a computer microphone

[00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:50.390]
Sure it is

[00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:54.810]
The computer is sitting right behind where I have my crack where sitting on the account or you

[00:33:55.430 --> 00:34:00.850]
You can try it if you want, but it's going to take some doing you don't have Yahoo messenger installed on your computer all all of these people out

[00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:04.510]
I know forget about all that. I appreciate all of their helpful

[00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:09.970]
Suggestions, but I hope it's what we're doing now and make it very complicated right now

[00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:14.690]
Let me just tell you the thing about this that's the most aggravating and frustrating and this is the QAM f in way

[00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:21.910]
Is that I'm confident that since they're having this thing about the people meter and arbitra and that meeting going on

[00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:24.650]
It whatever engineer would be in the building would be in that meeting

[00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:31.510]
I don't know if they are I'm confident that they're over in the other building doing the other work to move the station over there

[00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:32.790]
That's what my theory is

[00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:38.470]
Josh found Timmy. He's next door in engineering on the phone with whom we don't know, but that's where he is

[00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:45.950]
Oh, that's good. So he's on the phone with AT&T obviously we don't know or he's on the phone with a hot date or correct. He's on the phone

[00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:51.650]

Let's not yeah, let's play with anything. Let's quit while we're behind

[00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:23.050]
There's something really wrong with this thing being out this long. I can't recall the last time

[00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.810]
You know, I mean once in a while to go out for a few seconds like this

[00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:30.690]
Or for a few minutes and then they'll make the call and they'll yeah right back on again

[00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:38.070]
Yeah, maybe they haven't paid their bill. Hey anything's possible. Hey, we have keep trying to give the pull result for me

It's charging as we go

[00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:17.230]

I could do like the rest of this segment from my bedroom. Wow

[00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:26.250]
Sitting on the bed. Does your bed squeak at all or something? Can you jump up and down and make it squeak?

[00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.890]
Squeak, you know, it does not squeak. Although maybe the

[00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.710]
The dust mites might make some sounds the dust mites

[00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.270]
That whole crap about the pillow that is

[00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:36.570]
Legend that it sits nonsense

[00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:39.850]
Half of the way that the pillow is from dead

[00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:46.470]
For first of all if there was that much matter in there you would be able to see it or at least smell it

[00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:48.910]
Smell it

[00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:50.070]
Don't you think

[00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:55.110]
If it's dust I might waste that you'd be able to smell it after a while

[00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.110]
Oh look at this

[00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:01.010]
Holzer the very jackass sentence

[00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:08.310]
Holzer Holzer and Fistill LLC is investigating possible violations of state law for among other things

Breachers of fiduciary do the in connection with a proposed buyout of Cox radio ink

[00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:16.030]
By Cox enterprises ink

[00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:22.270]
Other the agreement announced the Monday Cox enterprises will pay $3.80 a share for a total price of approximately

[00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.330]
$69.69

[00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:28.070]
$69.1 million in all cash transaction

[00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:37.090]
Cox enterprises on approximately 68% of the outstanding shares of Cox radio and as vote in control of for approximately 97% of Cox radio stuck

[00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:42.970]
If consummated Cox radio will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Cox enterprises the firm's investigation

[00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:53.690]
Is focused on among other things whether the proposed deal consideration provides adequate value to Cox radio is minority shareholders and whether the deal comports with apical the law

[00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.950]
Wow

[00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:03.810]
Of course not about who these people are and they're in Atlanta and of course that's the home base of Cox raw cash the Cox

[00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:09.250]
A hoist is Atlanta when that be something they get their ass in the ringer. That would be great. Yeah

[00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:12.510]
That's my opinion on my business. Yeah, I can't play it like I said

[00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:14.410]
I don't see anything change

[00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:20.870]
That's my opinion box. I'm like disnerving no and Josh got a report from Timmy's saying nothing nothing new we know nothing

[00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:28.690]
Now can you interpret that okay, I can play that English for me. What what does that mean?

[00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:34.250]
I can try well all right. Let me tell you what I know about what's going on. Yes, nothing. I'm done

[00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.910]
What kind of an answer is that it's what I got nothing

[00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.330]
We said the typical QA M answer right

[00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:52.610]
You know how like if I had something to tell the the opposite of that

[00:39:55.590 --> 00:40:00.430]
I think you had a really good idea about my take it off the rest of the show. I don't think anyone would blame you

[00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.390]
Oh, I got some spots in here today

[00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:08.510]
Well, you could you got them though, right?

[00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:12.330]
They're they're they're in the machine. I had

[00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:16.910]
I had to record it to me. I just encased because I'm not you know because when there's one technical issue

[00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:18.050]
You know how Murphy's lies

[00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:23.190]
There's no guarantee that there's not gonna be two or three on the on the heels of it just and especially knowing this place

[00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:24.890]
Faggerman whoa

[00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:28.130]
We might be back man

[00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:33.850]
I'm looking at the lights nothing happened. I don't know why I'm here myself back somebody in the control of him doing something

[00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:35.950]
Potch game Josh quarters is gonna go investigate right now

[00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:41.930]
Somebody doing what where? Potch game in the control room perhaps that's just a theory

[00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:44.490]
No, there's nobody in there. So I don't know what that was all about

[00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:48.790]
Maybe switching some wires in the back that was bizarre

[00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:53.210]
That was really strange and I was hoping that when that was going on

[00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:59.290]
I would look down here at to the the green lights all come back. No, no, I got excited too, but no false along

[00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:00.630]
You see

[00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:06.950]
In the past year what's the longest time we have ever been without your cell phone and you see if I didn't have my cell phone right

[00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:09.490]
I made my crackberry we'd be upschmitz Creek

[00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:13.950]
Or you'd be doing the show and I'd be a woodbine a few hours 71

[00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:20.090]
A day 63 never been without my cell phone 37. That's what I voted since I got it

[00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:23.710]
A week 26 among 15 12 votes

[00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:25.890]
That's what we got

[00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:35.190]
Oh, here's a really good suggestion. Hey Neil. How about using your current snafu to take a few phone calls?

[00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:41.150]
Yeah, yeah, our current snafu that would be more difficult

[00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:46.730]
That would be what more difficult than ever not impossible, but it'll be sound awful because I won't be able to

[00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:51.010]
Control the levels individually for you and the other callers. Yeah

[00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:53.270]
Well, it's not gonna happen good

[00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:59.250]
Just an idiot wrong day for that if there was a right phone calls. Yeah

[00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:02.470]
In fact, when I'm doing the show any day is around day

[00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:04.790]
If there's a right day at eight o'clock

[00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.330]
I'm your friend

[00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:13.030]
There's probably in the meeting too. They might be

[00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:18.590]
Prozac Ron and the chambon would not surprise me and the the Reverend and the boyfriend

[00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:20.150]
Probably in the meeting right

[00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:22.690]
sitting at the head of the conference table

[00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:25.650]
fondling jolly joe's earlobes

[00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:30.430]
Oh my god, so so he told you nothing nothing

[00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:37.810]
I mean, I just don't know what kind of an answer that is. I mean wouldn't the answer be whether he's the

[00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:43.750]
AT&T says it's not the line or or something. I figured you'd be used to that by now

[00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:46.550]
Working here. Oh usually when we have these things

[00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:50.830]
There's somebody doing something and they you know and they make something happen

[00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:53.910]
Well, maybe they eliminated that person's position

[00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.030]
Like a fat Julio

[00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:03.570]
Right he was a great engineer. He helped to put build this whole studio up here and they blew him out

[00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:06.710]
They blew his ass out

[00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:13.150]
So you're right maybe maybe somebody left

[00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:19.610]
Somebody who knew their crap probably got blown up. Well here. Why does Neil sound like he's not a bad remote says Rob because

[00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:23.750]
Our phone line is down and Neil is doing the show on the phone today Rob. That's why

[00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:27.230]
Todd says I love it. Mark Koney from the grave

[00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:31.850]
I'm in a hole in the ground with a metal helmet. I'm listening to you on a shortwave hiding from the Kaiser

[00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:37.390]
What you guys have to do to put on a show these days is beyond belief nice infrastructure, right?

[00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:40.830]
I'll continue monitoring you regardless great show and best regards always

[00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:44.810]

Yeah

[00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:54.310]
Yeah, listen we are we're we deserve a medal for this today if you would have seen

[00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:59.850]
Like leading up to showtime what I had to go through just to get you on the phone and get the spots all

[00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:02.910]
Up and running in the show open and all of this other stuff

[00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:09.870]
Well, let's do the spots now because that's what we're here for yeah do a q thing like uh, you know say q a.m

You backtrack this is the

Any questions all the executives and their family should be executed with piano wire around their next my greatest hope

[00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:37.250]
When they get

[00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:49.230]
I take the baseball back and break their legs and knees and start with

[00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:56.570]
Let's tidy and the wire ground to see

[00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:57.670]
Oh

[00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:01.610]

I'm looking for all the studios names kids where they live etc

[00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:29.850]
Once and for all let's hear lies

[00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:35.370]
These badish mugs whose mouths are filled with lies

[00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:42.650]
Let's pull out their nails and wrap their entrails around and Christmas tree

You came back with a vengeance you're all booming really yeah, it sounds great. I want to thank

[00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:19.870]

Take Josh. I'll send the first out this week and Joe Bell came in and uh, you know

[00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:28.090]
Heard us saying that we weren't getting any information and he called George Corso and got some information

[00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:31.310]
And then shortly thereafter the line came back on which I'm sure was just a point

[00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:39.470]
Ha ha ha ha and that double echo double speak we were here in was obviously the line uh, lurching back to life really yeah, so whoo

[00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:40.730]
So here we go

[00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:46.510]

[00:46:54.890 --> 00:47:00.170]
The deal with that is that we're and we're living in great precarious financial time. Yeah, listen today's economy

[00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:05.530]
I can use that I think exactly right in today's economy. I got no I don't come to pennies to a rough together

[00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:09.690]
Hey, mister, I'm in worst shape than you just remember that at the end of the day. That's what you think

[00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:15.310]
You know what I'm gonna dependents that I do that's that I'm not going to uh the hard rock pulling the slot machine

[00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:19.230]
So you're doing just that if we're if we're for the money I'm making there I'd be in the poor house

[00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:21.270]
I'd be at the Mount Elliott soup kitchen and Detroit

[00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:28.490]
It'll be in the mail this week and we really appreciate your assistance. Thank you. This is it man. This is the final check here

[00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:32.010]
For you really yeah for me the first one for a tubby

[00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:32.910]
That's right

[00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:38.370]
He's doing a good job. I think well, that's good stories are getting on there. Well, that that's all accounts, right?

[00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:40.850]
Then that's all accounts for us. Yeah

[00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:44.430]
It's so so jolly joe bell came in here

[00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:51.010]
Wow and he intervened well, he had that big meeting going on here with the ppm and the pp

[00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:52.830]
They're always having a meeting about the pp

[00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:57.570]
Okay, let me get back to all right

[00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:58.850]
What we're doing

[00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:06.230]
Here's one from somebody who says, haha, haha, I'm about to feed my pants over here. What kind of a station is this?

[00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:11.270]
Oh man, this is awesome even the banana republic by cuba's has a better radio operation than wqm

[00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:14.030]
You finally made it to the top of me. I guess you can retire now

[00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:18.230]
You've officially experienced everything go wrong on the radio. Yeah, no, this is nothing new

[00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:23.870]
We've been through this before right and being the stellar professionals that we are we make it happen okay

[00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:32.590]
And thanks to whoever Timmy or whoever an engineer or George Corso who may were everybody got with AT&T and got the damn line back up

[00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:37.830]
But John has a how does a lot of while you already answered a pigeon piece?

[00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:43.330]
Who knows lot of miles between this man? That was up 166 boy. This feels so much better doing it this way

[00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:48.630]
That sounds better too in my crackberry is there got 90% charge

[00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:50.110]
All right

[00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:54.610]
So that wasn't although it's going to be a hell of a phone bill and I'm not paying it

[00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:58.150]
Don't you think for an hour international call

[00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:05.310]
Expense account it brand and says are you gonna be refunded money for making an international call to host the show have your cell phone

[00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:10.350]
Have your cell phone for the month bill paid for using majority of your minutes

[00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:12.150]
What does that mean?

[00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:17.050]
Says I don't know what kind of cell plan you have but I'm sure somewhere someplace

[00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:20.510]
This is costing somebody some serious money for a four-hour international call

[00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:24.650]
Well, I try to be a one-hour international call. Thanks God. Thank the Lord

[00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:26.670]
Wow

[00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:30.970]
You know it's a good thing we don't get as panicky as some of these people in the audience

[00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:32.370]
I'm gonna do this

[00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:38.250]
We got it we've been here before we know what to do been there done

[00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:41.450]
But thank you thank you because they were all very thoughtful. I'm sure they wanted to help

[00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:47.510]
Well, wait till you hear the next one from a heath. Oh, please

[00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:54.490]
Don't you think it's about time I blocked heath. I'm gonna even I'm getting tired of his crap

[00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:56.450]
Whatever

[00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:01.350]
Said George is not trying to solve the problem by getting people involved to fix it at the same time

[00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:06.250]
Keep saying you should stop doing the show today. This is the same show. He thinks you're doing wrong by taking emails

[00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:08.250]
Hmm very interesting

[00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:09.690]
Hmm, yeah, I'm blocking

[00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:13.090]
And scab pick and stalky fat

[00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:16.010]
Yeah, scab picking scum ball

[00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:21.410]
George answers since you're on the phone can you give us today's fishing report like Captain Bouncer used to

[00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:28.910]
No, but I can do a fabulous final report like Chuck Myers guest used to we're gonna replace Captain Bouncer with a hot chick with big boobs called Captain Bouncy

[00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:30.510]
And she's gonna give the fishing report

[00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:34.010]
How about Captain Howdy? Why not?

[00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:35.870]
He comes up a lot

[00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:42.990]
The thou is up 188 and there's Ali Feltching, but what we're seeing is a sense that things are moving. Yeah, things are moving like your bowels

[00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:47.530]
He's got the vest on today. That's silly queen. What does it is one should have been on that?

[00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:53.230]
He's not his look. Yeah, that's his look. He's a giant glasses and a mister mr. Egghead

[00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:55.110]
Not a wedding ring on his hand

[00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:03.770]
I don't know. I can't see his left hand you saw a wedding ring. I see his right hand

[00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:08.930]
I forget where they are. I don't know where they go. I don't wear one. No, he don't have no wedding ring. Are you a crazy person or what?

[00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:17.250]
Maybe it's a bed wedding ring. Yeah, no, he don't have no wedding ring on on either hand. He might have a right there. Look on his right hand ring. Yeah

[00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:22.370]
He's got a friendship ring like the adonis brothers. Yeah, I didn't know

[00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:23.610]
a friendship ring

[00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:26.990]
And Joey Jonas has a ring

[00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:29.410]
For real friendship bathtub ring

[00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:34.510]
This goes says go to woodbinds already. I want to hear the bells and whistles of those slot machines

[00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:36.930]
So sit the next to a machine

[00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:41.490]
Next to an outlet and charge it from the casino. Let's go get a move on old man

[00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:44.170]
Good thing. I didn't go anywhere. Okay, including across the street

[00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:48.810]
Right so that I was here when the green lights came on and I went like oh, yeah

[00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:50.130]
We're back

[00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:54.210]
It's still took a few seconds. Oh after the green lights came on for the

[00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:57.090]
Audio to start puking through. I wonder why

[00:51:58.170 --> 00:51:58.990]
Yeah, I don't know

[00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:02.550]
Andres says WTF

[00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:06.650]
Sounds like the beesleys are squeezing your nuts and let me say this to you

[00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:11.150]
If I wouldn't take any advice and take it off which I had no intention of doing that would have been embarrassing

[00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:16.390]
What's the money I came back up at 11 o'clock? It wasn't my advice. The hell wasn't okay saying oh, you know if you took off

[00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:21.890]
Nobody would blame you. I don't do that kind of crap. Okay. That's what I want to those slackers like you're thinking about

[00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:26.630]
I show up here rain shine. It's a little murky by the way

[00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:29.490]
That was up 160 points

[00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:32.430]
Here's an i report from Karen on CNN

[00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:41.510]
He's answering world as you know I inherited when he said that what oh my god. Oh, here we go again. Oh my god

[00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:42.590]
What's he be talking about?

[00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:48.710]
Sounds like the beesleys are squeezing you nuts really it does not sound like for real you actually sound like an old man

[00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:50.470]
I am an old man, so

[00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:54.930]
Don't go neal please. I won't be able to work if you're off the please

[00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:59.170]
Keep it coming rages before you get joist right out to would bind says on race

[00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:04.250]
P.S. If you scored would buy more like a son of a bitch all these people are experts. I've been doing your extremely well there

[00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:10.370]
Even yesterday I had a difficult day. I still want a couple hundred bucks and they weren't paying no good machine man

[00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:16.330]
And the old guy who smells like he peed in his pants all the time he was there

[00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:22.690]
Playing his five credits on a quick hit and the guy with the uh the young guy with a black glove the black leather glove

[00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:28.190]
His leather freak really is one credit at a time. He's there every day time. Dalai do his type of machine

[00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:38.630]
Here's a of facts. I've just gone to add facts interested in having a Starbucks cafe right in your place

[00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:41.990]
Abinus caller email today. Yeah, let's have a Starbucks in here

[00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:48.970]
Then I can start drinking coffee in the park. I'll spend the whole show on the can then we can do that thing from the crackberry again

[00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:52.690]
That was very entertaining

[00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:55.530]
Kind of it was a trip

[00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:01.450]
Here's an earlier one where I'm getting caught up on stuff now

[00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:07.170]
Brandon who's just in a feeding frenzy today says I say we'd be garlic. It's the perfect day to take a field trip

[00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:12.850]
Take the show on the road and I agree with George go to the Chinese market or go to one of your many other haunts like red lobster

[00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:19.930]
But there's something I really want to know how long is that bad we're gonna last on your blankberry four hours straight is quite a bit for talk time

[00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:21.690]
That's when I went here. I read that

[00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:27.810]
And I ran into the other room and I got my charger and I plugged it in had just just uh just the right amount of cord

[00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:32.450]
Everything worked out like magic might not run for four hours straight, but it'll run for four hours gay

[00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:33.770]
Gay

[00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:37.570]
I think I think the line just went out again

[00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:43.930]
No

[00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:51.630]
I have to say that I didn't think much of burn a maid off the first time I laid eyes on

[00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:56.750]
I shook his hand and quickly realized my watching wallet were missing

[00:54:57.330 --> 00:54:58.630]
So me and the sisters

[00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:04.270]
Punished him and by punished I mean violated him in the shop

[00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:11.030]
Surely after that I remember when Brenner tried to run a ponsous game with all coss of cigarettes

[00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:16.990]
Well, we lost everything so we shanked Bernie and the shower

[00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:19.290]
Then violated him once again

[00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:21.090]
And the shower

[00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:25.450]
Near the end of our brief time to give that shashank

[00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:29.030]
I gave Bernie a post of Raquel Welch

[00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:33.950]
He promised to pay me for it, but he escaped without reimbursing him

[00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:37.310]
So I escaped ten years later

[00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:40.850]
Tracked him down at his combine and say what to nail

[00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:42.470]
met him for tea

[00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:44.290]
gained his trust

[00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:47.630]
Convince him to take a shower with me and then

[00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:49.690]
When he leaves expected it

[00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:54.490]
Shanked him and violated him over and over

[00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:57.390]
and over in his shower

[00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:00.990]
I'm his burning

[00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.410]
You know

[00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:05.970]
Whenever I think of repeatedly violating burning me it off

[00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:08.590]
It always makes me some calm

[00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:13.490]
Rectum well 1118 at 560 we're back

[00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:21.730]
But you're not going to be too happy about this next email. Oh whatever from the fake Johnny dark. Oh

[00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:25.950]
George was able to turn you against Glenn and he's been a hangar around ever since

[00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:30.970]
He contributes very little to the show. He's disinterested in a bore. I can't stand listening to him anymore

[00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:32.350]
He doesn't belong on the air

[00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:35.850]
Says the real or fake Johnny dark take your choice

[00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:36.230]
Yeah

[00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:39.730]
Yeah, what the real Johnny dark

[00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:42.850]
Your mama good thing. We're not here to take abuse

[00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:44.550]
We're not

[00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:47.990]
Do you not you're not want me to read those anymore?

[00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:53.270]
Do whatever you want. I'm gonna do whatever I want. I know. I'm just asking just to kill some guy

[00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:54.650]
You know, I don't care

[00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:58.850]
But that shut in say honor off here. That is right

[00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:05.210]
So just relax I am kills four hours magnificently. Well, I think it's going swimmingly well

[00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:12.250]
I feel good about the show right now not not great. I wish I wish we could do it the way you know

[00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:14.150]
We would want to do it, but we can on the phone

[00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:19.250]
Yeah, let's go back do it on the phone. I enjoy that more with a little clip on Mike

[00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:27.130]

[00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.350]

[00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:53.010]
And here it is almost 1130. We're just getting around to the important death George Kell dies who

Tiger's broadcaster for nearly 40 years died Tuesday. He was 86 one of the worst of the X-Jock broadcasters

[00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:19.470]
He did the TV for the Tigers for a hundred years if Rocky could get on now and storm and Norman could get a hold of one

[00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:23.830]
The Tiger is to be right back and he just he was just awful awful

[00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:33.650]
Jackson's funeral home in Newport, Arkansas confirmed that that didn't give a cause the Hall of Fame City died in his sleep at his hometown in Swifton 86

[00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:37.250]
Die in your sleep. That's not a bad deal, huh? I'll take it although

[00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:40.390]
Kell was severely injured in a car crash in 2004

[00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:43.950]
But was able to walk with a cane about six months later. See, that's probably why he croaked

[00:59:46.110 --> 00:59:50.730]
Once you get we'll want your body gets like severe trauma like that. You're gonna be dead someday. Right

[00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:59.350]
Kell outlasted Williams for the 1949 batting crown hitting 342.91 while the Red Sox great finish at 342.76

[01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:16.270]
There's no one who loved and respected the game more than George Hall of Fame president Jeff Eidelson said not only was he wanted

[01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:22.910]
Baseball's true legends. He was a fan too. He loved coming to Cooperstown and sharing in the camaraderie with this Hall of Fame family

[01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:30.510]
After he retired Cal broadcast Tigers games from 59 to 96 if you can call it that every year except 1964

[01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:36.070]
Long time Tigers broadcast to Ernie Harwell and Kell became close friends while working together in TV and on radio

[01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:40.010]
He had a very laid back style hurr hurr well toe wwj in Detroit Tuesday

[01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:42.450]
He was easy going in an expert on the game

[01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:45.490]
He brought the field of the booth because he played and played well

[01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:50.210]
He had a conversational style that people took to he was awful just horrendous

[01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:55.210]
If storm and Norman can get a hold of on I mean he was just rooting the whole game

[01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:58.930]
He didn't broadcast the game. He was just rooting how trying to figure out the Tigers would win and they didn't

[01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:03.970]
Al Kell I know for all the famous for the Tigers also was a broadcasting colleague of Kels

[01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:08.750]
George was a great friend and like a big brother to me Kell I said yesterday when we broadcast together

[01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:11.270]
I was a rookie and he was a veteran. He was a great mentor to me

[01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:12.410]
Wow

[01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:21.510]

Rachel Ray and surprisingly enough Donald Chump

[01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:54.730]
He was near the front door greeting guests when we arrived and he suddenly turned around almost ran over my wife

[01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:58.650]
He couldn't have been more embarrassed repeatedly apologizing to her. He was very gracious

[01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:04.890]
Among the a whole celebs were Oprah who had to have her own private room away from the common people and Dr.

[01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:08.950]

[01:03:36.830 --> 01:03:41.670]
If Rocky could get a hold of one now and storm and Norman can get up there and I hit one

[01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:46.010]
This is the end of the game with the tickets. He is my shoulder one or something

[01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.390]
I'll figure it out how to get in the game

[01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:55.430]

[01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:02.710]
Please no cameras. I have your way

[01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:09.330]

[01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:13.790]
Head the agency that oversees the IRS when I neglected to pay my own jacks as well

[01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:20.370]
As you know, Rahm Amanduel is missing a finger and well the president took pity on me when he was told I

[01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:25.250]
I only have one testicle. Yes, it's true. See here

[01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:30.130]

[01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:36.850]
So so let me reassure you that when it comes to the economy I have got this thing well in hand

[01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:45.530]

For all you harness racing people never got a word about Aaron Merrimon yesterday. What a you know, it's just amazing

[01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:39.570]
And I realized that most people don't give a crap about horse racing or harness racing especially but it's just just that

[01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:41.230]
South Florida such a narrow

I mean, you know, oh hockey that's a soccer on ice. We don't care about that. Yeah, no matter what it is

[01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:51.610]
They don't know from it all they know about his early bird dinners and freeloading and being angry and

[01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:55.850]
Bat that's it in a place that could use more things to do

[01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:01.030]
This is their attitude. Well, they always say oh, there's so much to do here the golf is great in the

Accomplished miracles here today. I agree and I sure learned a lot before I learned a whole lot about that crack

[01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:34.070]
Burian a little

[01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:35.430]
Headset

[01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:38.550]
Johnny Horton he's still there

[01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:40.690]
He was one swallow guy

[01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:47.270]
And the whole thing with a crackbird it was a pretty interesting experiment. So if that ever happens again

[01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:51.030]
We're prepared right keep that headset like right there handy

[01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:59.610]
It is as a matter of fact all of the the little the little clip on there. Yeah. Oh, that's a shell off a waste

[01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:04.390]
I take mine off anyway, it's the why because it's worthless. I never use that clip

[01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:08.590]
I use the headset all the time and not the stupid little thing that that heads him and that little

[01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:11.830]

You know when you make it smaller you got to use less materials. Oh, but they got that nasty uncomfortable thing

That you're supposed to stick in your ears. Oh those things those things hurt. Yes

[01:08:26.490 --> 01:08:30.270]
You say the you said the stewie. What do I do with this? You stick it in your ear

[01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:34.970]
And I look right back in there and I throw it at her and say just stick it in your ass

[01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:37.610]
And then she does fits better

[01:08:38.650 --> 01:08:41.190]

[01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:18.810]
I'm so thrilled about the ab rocket showed up upstairs. What does that look like a rocket?

[01:11:42.690 --> 01:11:47.330]
We can start the new qm 790 equipment personnel sharing program as you already know

[01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:48.430]
Dave Lamont was on this morning

[01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:51.750]
He hasn't been mentioned enough to think of him as a serious contender for the morning show

[01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:57.630]
The best clue is who's been given more than just one tryout. You know who Jason Jackson has come an actor

[01:11:57.630 --> 01:12:00.990]
Either way whoever gets it. It's gonna be a soft-flow to retry

[01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:02.450]
How about that?

[01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:07.890]
Neil I know you do the handicapping this is this is really pathetic for Friday's second race

[01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.630]
And you actually have got me interested in the racing

[01:12:10.210 --> 01:12:12.990]
This weekend is probably the biggest day in photo horse racing

[01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:18.070]
I've found to go to the Florida Derby this Saturday pretty please can you do a briefing you the field for the Saturday Derby?

[01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:22.690]
No, I can't you may not have won all the races, but your picks seem to be good if I were going for perfected

[01:12:22.690 --> 01:12:27.970]
Tri-factors, etc. shove it up your ass mark the real mark stop by last time we were there

[01:12:29.410 --> 01:12:32.090]
The real mark hawk. Yeah, introduce themselves

[01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:35.110]
Shook our hands said hi get out of here

[01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:38.530]
Orm 790 that the very same

[01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:43.430]
And said what hi how are you

[01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:51.330]
And you said you're fair. I'm sure of something like that I shook his hand and uh, you know

[01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:56.230]
I didn't know the guy now I do yeah, no, that's the fake

[01:12:56.230 --> 01:12:59.310]
What was it the real one or the fake one? Well, it was the real one that showed up

[01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:02.150]
I don't know who you're getting the emails from it could be the real one or the fake one

[01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:05.510]
Maybe the real one sending emails in the fake one is the one that showed up that could be

[01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:06.990]
Neil Rogers. God

[01:13:09.230 --> 01:13:11.690]
Hello, I'm gonna bite off your nuts

[01:13:11.690 --> 01:13:20.530]
A wild horse becomes a bus by finding off some buddies. Let's you better not get my dander up

[01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:22.370]
I'll bite off your nose

[01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:27.970]
Wild horses have a lust for rafting their teeth around and trust your better than twice

[01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:34.970]
I'm messing with us. I'll bite off your nut. I like making a human trick. It doesn't mean I'm gay

[01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:39.490]
Orses have a nasty streak you better stay out of my way

[01:13:39.490 --> 01:13:46.110]
A wild horse will use his chops to bite off your rocks and they do post-op if you want to hold on to what you're got

[01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:49.490]
Better listen to this

[01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:53.650]
All bite off your nuts

[01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:00.990]
1145 at 560 WQAM

[01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:04.910]
Very jackass says hawk is a great guy in a great radio talent

[01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:09.850]
He's the creative force behind the Dan La Bastard show with stooots. He's a big fan of your show

[01:14:09.850 --> 01:14:13.390]
How do you like that? He's a big fan of the show. That's why he keeps sending me all these emails

[01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:16.930]
Right, you're a imaginer and you think it's the fake mark hawk of course

[01:14:17.850 --> 01:14:21.790]
Everybody speak even George Ann who says forgot to mention last night's front line was great

[01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:26.830]
It dealt with a trillion dollar deficit and how bush 43 kept screwing off the economy with tax cuts and more

[01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:31.650]
You can watch it again on pbs.org if it's been mentioned already sorry it hasn't no

[01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:33.710]
I want to thank you. Thank you

[01:14:33.710 --> 01:14:39.290]
Thanks to your Jan I think she's fake. No of course not. Well there you go. See what would you mean of course not? How do you know?

[01:14:40.410 --> 01:14:41.210]
Joey Reynolds

[01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:43.290]
He's fake

[01:14:44.130 --> 01:14:47.530]
The real artist fake the great Vidal lyric king

[01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.770]
Yeah

[01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:53.510]
Dave Lamont oh no he's the real one you can show

[01:14:56.170 --> 01:15:02.310]
Thanks to a gentleman Johnny dark Johnny dork I said that you did I didn't hear it. I was all right talking over me. It's all right

[01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:06.450]
That was up 100 you know not only they put the

[01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:10.650]
Stock market numbers in really tiny print at the bottom right hand corner on CNN

[01:15:10.650 --> 01:15:17.090]
But also now they put them in like green so you definitely even if you want to read them you can't you know what I mean?

[01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:19.430]
You know how like certain fluorescent

[01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.730]
um

[01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:25.630]
Things are very hard to read if they're in red you know what I mean? Yeah

[01:15:26.210 --> 01:15:31.590]
Well that's what they're doing. I think they're trying to make everybody look at that oil is almost 54 bucks a barrel

[01:15:32.150 --> 01:15:34.430]
It is now. It's a little 54 and a something

[01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:39.850]
Damn ragheads are squeezing it again squeezing and squeezing and squeezing

[01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:44.270]
And the loony's 81.71 that's not good but that's not all that bad

[01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:47.350]
stays down there near 80 cent. I'll be I'll be fine

[01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:52.550]
And that court is man putting a pressure on for that check doesn't he know that I hate that?

[01:15:56.210 --> 01:15:57.670]
No, I think you might know though

[01:15:59.870 --> 01:16:04.490]
What I don't like being pressed for money. I don't like when somebody says oh when you're gonna send me that check that

[01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:08.690]
Especially when I don't owe him anything I owe him nothing

[01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:17.250]
I just invented those checks is a way of saying thanks for doing the bedtime stories and here's a few bucks

[01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:23.670]
Now that's all in my right. Okay. There was never any contractual or or even non-contract there

[01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:28.010]
Where there was never any discussion about it? I don't know what was discussed or what was going in your head so

[01:16:29.490 --> 01:16:31.690]
Nothing what was going on in my head. I don't know

[01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:33.410]
Probably not much

[01:16:34.770 --> 01:16:36.510]
Remember we had the story about

[01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:41.390]
George Weber the ABC radio newsman who got killed yes

[01:16:42.370 --> 01:16:44.430]
By some hustler

[01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:51.690]
Yes, and emotionally disturbed 16-year-old is confessed to killing ABC radio newsman George Weber and his Brooklyn apartment last Friday

[01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:56.830]
And what appears to be rough sex gone very wrong rough sex gone very wrong

[01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:59.150]
But that was up on 75

[01:17:01.630 --> 01:17:08.970]
The teen's name isn't being released but cops tracked him down via Weber's email and cell phone records and he reportedly confessed to the crime early this morning

[01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:12.590]
We hit Bruno to tag you four o'clock this morning

[01:17:13.150 --> 01:17:13.590]
Yeah

[01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:17.130]
Weber had placed a craigslist ad looking for rough sex

[01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:23.250]
He saw the victims ad looking for violent sex and said I can smother somebody for 60 bucks

[01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:26.770]
But it got out of hand as sort of said I can smother somebody

[01:17:28.050 --> 01:17:34.210]
The teen admittedly stabbed Weber but couldn't remember how many times because he blanked out during the violent drug fuel to solve

[01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:36.350]
I see it was an ass-all

[01:17:37.330 --> 01:17:40.250]
Details are still sketchy, but uniformly horrifying

[01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:44.810]
New York Post says that the suspect told police that Weber pulled a knife on him

[01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:47.390]
He took it and stabbed the former radio newscaster

[01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:53.830]
Weber apparently fought back and wounded his killer but ended up stabbed dozens of times with his ankles bound with duct tape

[01:17:55.450 --> 01:17:59.430]
Always good to have a role of duct tape around yeah, no, it's not apparently

[01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:03.430]
Well, not good for a Weber but great

[01:18:05.370 --> 01:18:08.530]
Good for the stabby yes, not a stab in the one

[01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:14.910]
Take a stab at it. Oh here's the now here's the definite fake

[01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:18.050]
The fake team defeatus

[01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:24.250]
High near the risk of pissing you off. I have to agree with Rick Shaw and the others whoever the others are

[01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:28.450]
The phone calls are a vital element missing from your show. Well, you know what you don't like to show Jim

[01:18:28.450 --> 01:18:30.890]
Fats-o don't listen or anybody else

[01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:36.070]
Unlike George. I do enjoy the emails, but the phone calls add something to the show that is now missing

[01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:39.330]
Yeah, an aggravation lots and lots of aggravation grief

[01:18:39.330 --> 01:18:39.930]
Cyrus

[01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:45.810]
I do agree with a sentiment that George is getting a little out of control has been a surly contrarian lately

[01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:50.870]
He's a fine board operator and producer who cares if he likes the inside radio emails or not

[01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:53.250]
Inside radio emails my ass

[01:18:54.570 --> 01:18:57.310]
See that the inside radio it was a substitute for fake

[01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:58.410]
In that case

[01:18:59.070 --> 01:19:04.890]
Yeah, the listeners are listening to hear the near-roger show not George Rodriguez. Oh, he's just taking shots at everybody

[01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:10.310]
Right, I also agree with the prevailing sentiment that the sports radio format is unsaturated

[01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:20.010]
I think he might mean oversaturated. He says unsaturated like polyunsaturated olive oil. Oli Oliva get by any

[01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:26.310]
Oh my god, you know, I walk the the fact that he didn't get shot for that performance and godfather three

[01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:33.070]
Well, I got a thing here that's going to kill some great time. Oh, baby. I better not forget it. I have a lot of emails

[01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:42.530]
From Yahoo the Yahoo movies editorial staff created a handy checklist to track the hundred movies you must see before you die

[01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:47.330]
Network is on there by the way. I'm going to read the whole list excellent

[01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:50.250]
Hundred movies you must see before you die

[01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:52.590]
It says here

[01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:58.410]
I also agree with the prevailing sentiment that the sports radio format is unsaturated meaning obviously oversaturated Jim

[01:19:58.410 --> 01:20:02.730]
You fat turd the market is missing local talk radio and there a lot of us looking for work

[01:20:03.150 --> 01:20:04.650]
deregulation killed the radio star

[01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:05.930]
regards Jim

[01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:09.070]
Is now what I said when we had deregulation was going to kill the business

[01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:10.490]
I said it and it went happened

[01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:15.410]
Not that I'm always pressured because if I was I wouldn't have lost all that money in the market several years ago

[01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:18.770]
If I knew what that was if I knew it was a scam and a Ponzi game

[01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:21.810]
If I knew what I know now I wouldn't have invested the dime

[01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:25.790]
Over the dials up 166 points Neil yeah

[01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:29.970]
Now I don't want to say that there are people who are a little bit behind

[01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:35.290]
Today is Wednesday March 25th, right? Yeah

[01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:39.330]
On the email it shows you the time that it was sent

[01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:43.150]
Wednesday March 25th 11.09 a.m

[01:20:44.410 --> 01:20:45.870]
Got that within the audit

[01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:48.010]
Todd and Gina and the subject

[01:20:49.690 --> 01:20:52.990]
fatal attraction that's all it says fatal attraction

[01:20:54.410 --> 01:20:59.210]
Todd and Gina are telling us the name of the movie we're talking about how many days ago was that we couldn't

[01:20:59.210 --> 01:21:03.830]
think of the name of the movie what movie fatal attraction oh that one

[01:21:06.730 --> 01:21:09.650]
I mean talk about a delayed reaction a little bit

[01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:13.550]
delayed reaction to fatal attraction

[01:21:15.730 --> 01:21:16.170]
God

[01:21:18.810 --> 01:21:22.970]
Then that's just sad is what that is sad really sad

[01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:30.990]
Good Golly miss my 309 on the pool and we got five people don't have a cell phone

[01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:34.710]
Can you imagine not having a cell phone not anymore no

[01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:39.610]
I mean when you stop and think about it there there are certain

[01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:41.870]
Things that we have now

[01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:44.710]
Yeah, but once upon a time like television

[01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:47.930]
I can remember before we had tv because I'm an old fart

[01:21:50.730 --> 01:21:51.230]
Right

[01:21:52.570 --> 01:21:59.870]
So how do you live without television how can we live without cell phones computer without radio once upon a time once upon a time

[01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:05.070]
Radio was really important part of our lives and computers computers. Oh my god. Are you smitten me?

[01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:07.030]
God

[01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:09.010]
GPS

[01:22:09.010 --> 01:22:10.950]
Mm-hmm PPS

[01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:17.770]
Tom says newt gingrich was on tabbest smiley plug in his american solutions for winning the future nonsense

[01:22:19.610 --> 01:22:23.010]
And it goes on and on and on yeah, okay

[01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:27.750]
boring I don't want to hear about newt e gingrich old news stale

[01:22:29.130 --> 01:22:30.270]
stale and old

[01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:38.510]
In the past year what's the biggest the longest time you've been without your cell phone a few hours a hundred a day

[01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:43.870]
90 I've never been without my cell phone 52. That's me. I got this blackberry. It just

[01:22:44.770 --> 01:22:46.310]
glued to my ass a

[01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:52.070]
Week 36 a month 26 don't have a cell phone six out of 312. Oh

[01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:58.030]
I think I think what we ought to do is buy a cell phone for everybody who wants one can't afford it

[01:22:59.590 --> 01:23:02.010]
When that be nice gesture. I don't mean us. I mean the station

[01:23:03.670 --> 01:23:04.070]
Beasley's

[01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:10.930]
You think that would be a good idea an excellent idea

[01:23:13.330 --> 01:23:16.910]
And then we could get some great calls from those people too right when you do the show

[01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:23.450]
Or something you know we were driving back yesterday me and my caddy

[01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:28.010]
And the highway was all jammed up so we came through um through the city

[01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:33.630]
And on king street there were like I don't know how many quiznos we passed the whole bunch of them

[01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:35.950]
Every few blocks there was another one

[01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:43.350]
And now everybody's gonna say thank goodness for the new quiznos delivery. I think I want to start having delivery um

[01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:48.090]
Any down the year not every day, but you know once in a while. That does a great idea

[01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:56.830]
This is coach daren chuler and I sound like Bob hope on acid and I want to tell you it's the 12-1 hour or whatever it is

[01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:58.910]
He's going for three and yes

[01:23:58.910 --> 01:24:02.230]
Three bears at once with a new march madness beer funnel

[01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:10.070]
The only collegiate beer bomb capable of power forwarding 36 ounces of alcohol down your throat in a matter of seconds

[01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:11.910]
Now that's a slam dunk

[01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:15.430]
Be the ultimate bleachers creature with the march madness beer funnel

[01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:20.910]
Party foul not endorsed by the NCAA well

[01:24:20.910 --> 01:24:24.250]
It's 12 million at five sixty w.d. Kim the little hands about to the big hand

[01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:30.150]
You know what that means lunchtime? Yeah, lunchtime. Let me call quiznos and get a sub order

[01:24:32.290 --> 01:24:34.110]
Sounds good though, but a little bit too late

[01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:42.430]
Little bit too late and because in maybe 45 minutes and we're gonna start getting all dressed up all you know

[01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:44.230]
Ready to go

[01:24:45.610 --> 01:24:47.810]
Ready to rock and roll

[01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:48.850]
All right

[01:24:50.150 --> 01:24:55.070]
Kenny grahamers says hey, it's not so bad sounds a little bit different. This is back when we're doing our on the phone thing

[01:24:56.250 --> 01:25:01.790]
See we're gonna get a lot of this now because the oldest stuff is at the bottom of the pile. That's okay. I don't mind doing that

[01:25:03.850 --> 01:25:08.410]
Just tune in and took a moment before I could definitely identify you only the mid ranges coming in

[01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:11.370]
There I say it sounds slightly more intimate

[01:25:11.970 --> 01:25:16.570]
Like we were actually having a phone conversation. Oh, intimate should have been doing sound or real

[01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:19.450]
But by no means am I suggesting this is better just different

[01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:26.090]
As far as you're waiting against management wqm just talked on March 25th 2009 as living breathing evidence

[01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:30.090]
That's the one I was referring to okay. Can't play this one on them. This was AT&T

[01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:35.690]
So don't go blame in QA and management. Okay, just because they're incompetent most of the time

[01:25:35.690 --> 01:25:38.330]
Doesn't mean that they were responsible for today's

[01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:39.030]
Fowl up

[01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:40.430]
screw up

[01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:42.030]
Nightmare

[01:25:43.450 --> 01:25:47.910]
All in green lines all real pretty when they're all lit up like that in a row. It's a real pretty thing

[01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:50.090]
Yeah, it's a comforting sight to see

[01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:54.530]
Kind of like when Ray Perry waddles in

[01:25:59.290 --> 01:26:06.130]
You know one of the things I've noticed it would find a lot of the old people they waddle they shuffle yeah, there's a model they drag their feet

[01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:10.950]
Do they yep lift up your feet. Ah takes effort

[01:26:13.050 --> 01:26:14.070]
Speaking to English

[01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:20.010]
Yeah, a lot of people on waddle and some of the people they waddle from

[01:26:21.490 --> 01:26:23.270]
Side to side you know what I mean?

[01:26:25.570 --> 01:26:28.150]
Right hard to explain that's what you see like a duck

[01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:38.790]
Yeah, like like like one step the right side of the body goes up and the other side goes down and like vice vice versa like there's zigzagging as there was yeah, that's right zigzag

[01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:43.690]
And what kind of a candy bar is zigzag? I haven't had it in a long time. It's a rolling paper

[01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:46.930]
No, I'm not talking about that. There's a candy bar zigzag

[01:26:48.490 --> 01:26:50.270]
Zagna that's what you're thinking. I think oh

[01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:53.170]
zigzagna zigzagna

[01:26:55.330 --> 01:26:59.290]
I think you're nuts. It's the candy bar you can smoke yeah zigzag my ass

[01:26:59.870 --> 01:27:04.690]
Rolling papers for what I'm making some cigarette yeah, yeah, I'm gonna roll my cigarette. That's what I always tell them

[01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:08.850]
You know something in Europe. There are a lot of guys that do roll their own cigarette. Oh, yeah for fun

[01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:11.630]
No for cheap. Oh

[01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:20.370]
I'm not seeing this so it's all tobacco in there, but they they roll them I've seen it. I'm stood on. Mm-hmm. Of course there's a lot of shlippers there, you know

[01:27:22.690 --> 01:27:23.590]
Lons and shlippers

[01:27:24.610 --> 01:27:28.490]
Zisco says at the risk of getting George pissed off at me. Why don't you just start wood buying Wednesday

[01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:33.330]
If this show is gonna sound like crappy when it's about making sound like crap from outside your place

[01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:38.830]
If you get this connected just call back you can put your cabbie on long the way or just let George do the show

[01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:45.630]
You could be on the toilet now for all we know. Let me hear you flush it. I did flush it. Oh, that's earlier. Why would I get pissed off at that? Zisco

[01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:47.790]
He's

[01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:54.690]
Uphillated on now really goofy don't try don't be civil way now, too. Oh, I chase everybody do

[01:27:56.830 --> 01:27:59.390]
Here's one that says look at the history of the great Miami Commission

[01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:04.590]
One Miami arena. They still owe to 114 million dollars on it before was imploded

[01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:09.830]
Two American Airlines arena nobody goes there either those bright yellow seats had to be changed

[01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:12.810]
Because when they televised the games those empty seats were an eye sore

[01:28:13.230 --> 01:28:16.830]
Like the fleets that are in Boston. They the same thing bright yellow seats

[01:28:18.370 --> 01:28:23.130]
And three now the biggest ways to tax many of them all they're using public money to build this dating with the bed tax

[01:28:23.130 --> 01:28:25.030]
I don't know if they were aware that nobody is traveling

[01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:30.970]
How's it going to get funded this is the biggest con job ever and we're going to get screwed on this F the Marlins says to somebody

[01:28:31.450 --> 01:28:33.050]
With a phone number no name

[01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:36.090]
F the Marlins

[01:28:38.970 --> 01:28:41.730]
Joe Howard says oh, Joe Howard David

[01:28:42.810 --> 01:28:44.270]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:45.090]
Woo

[01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:50.070]
Joe Howard David again like that

[01:28:50.690 --> 01:28:54.590]
It's great. Hey, Neil my daughter in fifth grade has been selected as winner in these scholastic book clubs

[01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:56.250]
Deer Master President contest

[01:28:56.890 --> 01:29:00.050]
She along with 15,000 others across the nation wrote a letter to the president

[01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:03.650]
Although I'm proud of her achievement that is not the reason I'm writing to you

[01:29:04.110 --> 01:29:07.730]
In her letter to president Obama she mentions that she's got a problem with the pledge of allegiance

[01:29:07.730 --> 01:29:10.430]
Every day she recites the pledge along with their fellow students

[01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:12.490]
But she does not say the words under God

[01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:18.590]
Since president Obama recognized atheist Americans. He wants to know that her current pledge does not include all Americans

[01:29:19.710 --> 01:29:22.490]
She also wrote about problems with schools pollution etc

[01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:26.430]
But my satisfaction with her is not being automatically this qualified because of her beliefs

[01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:32.350]
Thanks to real citizens such as Robert new now who pushes the same argument to the course and others

[01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:34.830]
Who have argued my daughter's beliefs and thoughts

[01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:37.530]
Maybe these Obama years have released some potential

[01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:40.950]
You sound a lot different on the phones as Joe Howard David not to be confused with

[01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:42.530]
No Howard David

[01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:45.910]
Did I got a great article here about the Pope

[01:29:47.610 --> 01:29:50.210]
Do I have time before the break you bet good

[01:29:51.070 --> 01:29:57.310]
Let me make sure yeah, I got time. Let me put on my time. They put on my Pope story. Listen to that. Okay

[01:29:58.230 --> 01:30:00.870]
It's written by Theo Telcut on the smircling chimp

[01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:06.490]
He says the Catholic Church would just stop offering sex tips or edicts for a century or two

[01:30:06.490 --> 01:30:12.690]
Really all credibility on sexual issues is gone and the reactionary ignorant public policy and dangers humanity's long-term survival

[01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:19.510]
On a recent tour in Africa Pope Benedict says that condoms were not the answer to Africa's AIDS problem and could make the problem worse

[01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:22.670]
This is a sinful lie that will cause death to poor people

[01:30:23.190 --> 01:30:24.490]
Every time there's a big international

[01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:28.930]
Conference on world population the Catholic Church has been there and blocked birth control

[01:30:28.930 --> 01:30:33.310]
If the earth ends up in an overpopulated hell the infallible popes will be partially to blame

[01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:39.790]
And any would village in Alaska recently sued the church for sending a known pedophile priest to serve their community

[01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:45.550]
See it's a theme the Catholic Church is unhealthy about sexual issues and needs to stop screwing up public policy

[01:30:46.110 --> 01:30:49.950]
The church should either shut up or get help and become healthy the Catholic Church

[01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:55.610]
Could hire a consulting team of modern experts and healthy sexual human behavior and just adopt the recommendations

[01:30:55.610 --> 01:31:00.670]
Seriously will forgive you just apologize and rebrand and join the 21st century

[01:31:00.670 --> 01:31:05.510]
And pay the pedophile lawsuits by selling some of that land and billions of dollars worth of silverware

[01:31:06.210 --> 01:31:10.090]
The Catholic Church has been unhealthy about sexual issues since a demanded priest couldn't marry

[01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:14.350]
So that the church would inherit the property of the aristocratic aristocratic brethren

[01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:19.650]
This gambit worked on the Church is the world's biggest landowner but it's left an organization be followed by scandal

[01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:23.650]
As our cane is this history sounds that affects real people's lives

[01:31:23.650 --> 01:31:27.750]
Just a few weeks ago a friend went looking for condoms in Calcutta and they couldn't find them

[01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:31.150]
She was trying to help a young Indian woman acquire them to protect her and her lover

[01:31:31.150 --> 01:31:32.690]
She had a search high and low

[01:31:32.690 --> 01:31:37.550]
They were very very difficult to find and the pharmacist was reluctant to sell them to her because she was a woman

[01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:38.610]
This is madness

[01:31:39.370 --> 01:31:45.670]
Calcutta needs free condoms to be as common as cows in the street as our environment all our environmental problems are made much more difficult by the

[01:31:45.670 --> 01:31:47.170]
Surging growing of world population

[01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:52.550]
Calcutta is where mother Teresa did such saintly work all the while supporting the church and sexual rules

[01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:55.550]
Mother Teresa did great work helping the poor after they were already born

[01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:58.450]
And poor but didn't act to turn off the flood of the spigot

[01:32:00.650 --> 01:32:03.750]
And that was the him that was immoral of mother Teresa

[01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:08.570]
It is immoral to force the world's poor people to have babies

[01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:09.630]
They can't support properly

[01:32:09.630 --> 01:32:12.230]
But hey, thanks for helping with the problem that you help create

[01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:17.090]
The Pope and system prudish lectures to the world about the ins and outs of doing it

[01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:21.530]
As a monastic Catholic the Pope probably gave up sex with women many years ago

[01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:23.830]
And so probably there's not much experience with condoms

[01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:28.650]
That's okay, but don't teach about what you don't know. I would never lecture people on the proper way to fix a car's engine

[01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:36.210]
The Christian community has long been plagued by false morality on sexual issues by taking easy high-horse stances on difficult issues

[01:32:36.210 --> 01:32:38.930]
Christian side with the past society and the powerful

[01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:43.750]
But complex moral issues have two sides and sometimes we need to pick the lesser of the two evils

[01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:47.210]
P. Marital sex with condoms is better than unplanned pregnancy any day

[01:32:47.770 --> 01:32:50.270]
It's a false morality that stops contraception

[01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:54.990]
It claims to high moral ground but hurts the poor the stop condoms approach seeks to prevent sex

[01:32:54.990 --> 01:32:56.370]
The mostly harms the vulnerable

[01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:58.970]
Stopping abortion may protect the living fetus

[01:32:58.970 --> 01:33:01.870]
But robes women of reproductive rights that give them self-determination

[01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:05.290]
forcing young women to bear babies. They don't want is more immoral than abortion

[01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:10.630]
In all these issues the minor moral benefit of the prudish approach is outweighed by the harm caused to the innocent

[01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:14.490]
And when did ignorance of the human reproductive pipes become a sacred value

[01:33:15.170 --> 01:33:18.810]
An unscientific willful ignorance is the enemy of a sustainable world civilization

[01:33:18.810 --> 01:33:23.570]
We have 50 odd years of scientific research into sexuality to help us with these murky topics

[01:33:23.570 --> 01:33:25.370]
No need to listen to the Pope on this issue

[01:33:26.710 --> 01:33:29.270]
Fundamentalist Christians have long poshured as protectors of a

[01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:31.070]
Prudish heterosexual hegemony

[01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:35.990]
Jesus said don't worry about the spectrosautos in your neighbor's eye when you have a log in your own eye

[01:33:36.490 --> 01:33:40.770]
We've got bigger fish to fry than people making love before marriage planetary survival

[01:33:40.770 --> 01:33:45.690]
Global warming over population aids endless wars outdated authoritarian secret societies

[01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:51.090]
I always marvel that Christians dig in on sexual issues and the outrageous that they'll get worked up about

[01:33:51.090 --> 01:33:56.790]
Really sexy don't approve of that's the issue worth going to activist for not quantum or modern-day slavery or famine

[01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:58.890]
Cuz by export crops or the broken sky

[01:33:59.390 --> 01:34:02.950]
I think they choose sex issues to jump on because it seems an easy to explain

[01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:05.770]
Cultural issue and doesn't rock the pro corporate boat

[01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:09.910]
Dear Catholic friends, I apologize for mocking things you hold sacred

[01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:13.810]
I do it because you need it and we need you to regain your moral clarity for the healing of the world

[01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:17.670]
Planetary survival depends on family planning that makes it moral

[01:34:17.670 --> 01:34:23.570]
It is immoral for the Catholic Church to kill the planet from over population because of failure to adopt modern approaches to family planning

[01:34:24.130 --> 01:34:29.550]
Maybe Catholic family non-planning methods work to refill the pews, but today those methods are a danger to everyone

[01:34:30.330 --> 01:34:32.550]
Condoms should be a sacrament as they honor life-help

[01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:36.150]
Responsibility intelligence and care for the poor maybe in a few years the Pope

[01:34:36.150 --> 01:34:39.550]
Be blessing cargo planes that condoms heading for Africa

[01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:41.930]
Can you see that the Pope heading oh yeah?

[01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:47.350]
Oh, but you really can you know rural hotdog? No, that's right. He don't speak any any he's speaking in joy man

[01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:50.050]
It's Nazi Pope with a silly red shoes

[01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:57.390]
All new religions man your killers killers since the beginning of time

[01:34:59.650 --> 01:35:01.710]
It's what they do best sure

[01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:04.770]
Keep people stupid and overpopulating

[01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:11.630]
And coming to bring their last pesos to the church put a little something in the plate baby a little something something

[01:35:13.210 --> 01:35:17.830]
Then we all want a little something some sure that's what I'm hoping to win this afternoon a little something some

[01:35:18.690 --> 01:35:19.330]
few grand

[01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:22.590]
That would be grand maybe I'll play the

[01:35:24.530 --> 01:35:28.910]
What were they called the mega bucks the one that's like three million bucks right now I think okay

[01:35:31.150 --> 01:35:35.650]
Why not sure? I mean if you're gonna you know, we're gonna sit there and put money in the machine you might as well

[01:35:35.650 --> 01:35:39.630]
That's right. Yeah, I mean you got no chance of winning. It's like the lotto. There's no chance you're gonna win it

[01:35:41.930 --> 01:35:44.690]
But every time you hit the button there, you know the chances

[01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:51.450]
Slim but there's a big big pot waiting at the end of the rainbow. Oh, I suppose to like you know 10 bucks

[01:35:53.010 --> 01:35:57.870]
Like the new wheel of fortune. Oh, I got three sevens 10 bucks. What we do? What we do looks nice on there

[01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:06.170]
How about two sevens you know what two sevens is seven seven seven yeah

[01:36:06.970 --> 01:36:07.370]
So

[01:36:09.670 --> 01:36:12.810]
It's a radio station that many of us will never forget I

[01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:15.290]
Still I know we've done it a long time ago

[01:36:15.690 --> 01:36:19.510]
We need to do that pull about the greatest AM station of all time

[01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:23.970]
Okay, you don't think you don't like that. I do

[01:36:24.650 --> 01:36:28.150]
Do you I think the local stations will have a you know an advantage?

It's starting to give back

[01:48:46.730 --> 01:48:48.870]
He gave back some of the gains, you know, as they say

[01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:50.410]
All those cliches they used

[01:48:51.210 --> 01:48:52.370]
Minnesota, like he said

[01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:54.310]
Blanchard was a close friend

[01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:57.070]
And competent of Hall of Fame teammate Mickey Maddle

[01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:59.850]
Well, they probably saw each other naked

[01:48:59.850 --> 01:49:00.770]
Wouldn't surprise me

[01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:02.290]
But now he's dead

[01:49:02.290 --> 01:49:03.870]
How old was he? 76

[01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:05.510]
That's not all that old 76

[01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:07.430]
It's almost 77

[01:49:08.710 --> 01:49:10.030]
I think that's my goal

[01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:12.010]
I want to live to be 77

[01:49:14.970 --> 01:49:15.410]
Okay

[01:49:17.090 --> 01:49:20.790]
Oh, look at this, I'd like to place the below recruitment ad with your media

[01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:23.090]
Do you get any of those?

[01:49:23.490 --> 01:49:24.290]
All the time

[01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:26.130]
What is that?

[01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:27.610]
Just more spam

[01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:32.330]
Oh, I've got a stiff neck from doing a show on that cell phone

[01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:35.270]
Were you like holding it with your shoulders?

[01:49:35.530 --> 01:49:38.410]
I was holding it with my neck

[01:49:38.830 --> 01:49:39.190]
Okay

[01:49:41.410 --> 01:49:42.410]
You know how people do

[01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:45.930]
No, I was sitting in a bad, awkward position, I guess

[01:49:45.930 --> 01:49:46.290]
I don't know

[01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:50.770]
I'm just trying to come up with an excuse to take off the neck star

[01:49:50.770 --> 01:49:51.590]
I'm not going to do it

[01:49:52.230 --> 01:49:54.130]
You seem to be all going to hope

[01:49:54.130 --> 01:49:56.470]
No, no, listen, I was sympathetic to your situation

[01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:58.290]
I didn't know how cumbersome it was for you

[01:49:58.290 --> 01:50:00.030]
Or if you were hating life right at the moment

[01:50:00.030 --> 01:50:01.490]
And I was just, no, I was not here

[01:50:01.490 --> 01:50:04.650]
I thought, I thought, I thought, I think when those things happen

[01:50:04.650 --> 01:50:06.810]
It's kind of fun, I don't want to tap into a lot

[01:50:06.810 --> 01:50:08.510]
But right, I agree with you

[01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:10.350]
I was just thinking about you, dad

[01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:11.790]
Well, thanks son

[01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:15.810]
I mean, if you think that I'd rather do the show than rather than you, then you're crazy

[01:50:16.610 --> 01:50:18.130]
Well, at least you take some calls

[01:50:19.650 --> 01:50:20.470]
Take some crap

[01:50:21.870 --> 01:50:23.290]
Take some calls, come on, George

[01:50:23.290 --> 01:50:24.010]
George, not today though

[01:50:24.010 --> 01:50:25.450]
Right, I took one, you

[01:50:26.350 --> 01:50:28.130]
No, that's where I George took a great call

[01:50:28.130 --> 01:50:29.810]
By the way, by the way, by the way, great call

[01:50:32.010 --> 01:50:33.430]
Thank you for making your call

[01:50:35.110 --> 01:50:36.070]
Don't be chronic now

[01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:37.730]
Thank you for taking my call

[01:50:37.730 --> 01:50:38.290]
Yeah

[01:50:39.330 --> 01:50:40.730]
That's one of my favorite lines of all

[01:50:40.730 --> 01:50:43.170]
Thank you for taking my call, hang up and listen

[01:50:45.670 --> 01:50:46.470]
Oh, brother

[01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:47.290]
Just tragic

[01:50:49.450 --> 01:50:51.050]
This whole talk radio thing, man

[01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:52.330]
What a farce this has been

[01:50:54.130 --> 01:50:58.350]
And leave it to me to kind of like change gears and get on a different highway

[01:50:58.350 --> 01:51:01.670]
And go zip it down the highway with a different whole game plan

[01:51:02.670 --> 01:51:06.190]
Mike says tell Joe Bell to get a sped ass in line before the Dave County Commission

[01:51:06.810 --> 01:51:08.950]
To get some of the free money they passed out yesterday

[01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:13.890]
Last time I checked the Florida Marlins are a business just like you and Vs. They broadcasting

[01:51:13.890 --> 01:51:16.990]
Maybe Jolly Jogan get them to build a new studio with taxpayer money

[01:51:16.990 --> 01:51:18.010]
I don't think so

[01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:21.650]
I don't think Jolly Jogan's got any clout

[01:51:21.650 --> 01:51:24.330]
For the politicians in day, do you?

[01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.710]
No

[01:51:27.590 --> 01:51:30.790]
Sure got a pretty big pile out of this is old stuff though now

[01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:37.190]
Scott and Pinellas Park who is a chronic good one though

[01:51:37.630 --> 01:51:38.410]
He's all right

[01:51:39.150 --> 01:51:43.870]
He says this is yesterday since I voted for Richard Simmons I now want to switch it to our governor

[01:51:43.870 --> 01:51:47.770]
It's no secret the real reason he tied the knot was so hopefully get the VP

[01:51:47.770 --> 01:51:51.470]
Next to Gramps McCain didn't work did it how that work out Scott?

[01:51:56.290 --> 01:51:59.850]
Just unbelievable Charlie Chris you ferry

[01:51:59.850 --> 01:52:06.070]
I mean the fact that he's fooling anybody is just so so insane to me

[01:52:07.090 --> 01:52:12.890]
Rob says Stern is a talentless hose bag compared to you not entertaining not clever just not

[01:52:14.410 --> 01:52:17.270]
Robin Michigan thanks for the suck job Rob

[01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.510]
He's right

[01:52:19.250 --> 01:52:19.650]
Yeah

[01:52:20.650 --> 01:52:23.010]
How come he's making a hundred million year and I'm you know

[01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:26.690]
That's one of life's great mysteries

[01:52:27.490 --> 01:52:30.090]
Representation might be one factor but I think there's more than one

[01:52:30.090 --> 01:52:31.850]
Representation you don't think I got a bad agent do you?

[01:52:31.930 --> 01:52:35.210]
It's busy going back on here again this weekend on that bogus station

[01:52:35.650 --> 01:52:38.110]
Right there's also being in the right place at the right time

[01:52:38.110 --> 01:52:39.370]
You know little things like that

[01:52:41.490 --> 01:52:45.570]
I would not say in my wildest dreams that Howard's talentless that would be just

[01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:50.210]
He sure used to be funny as hell I'll take your word for it and then he started mailing it in

[01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:53.410]
I'm telling you long before I ever started listening

[01:52:55.250 --> 01:53:00.290]
Well when you know well you got to hear anything else Robin and he also

[01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:03.570]
Robin then already talking about his drug problem that's you know terminal

[01:53:04.450 --> 01:53:08.570]
Nobody did a great interview with Blackie with what's his name who's Blackie what's the kid?

[01:53:09.810 --> 01:53:14.010]
John Stamos oh see you I'm the one that has to come up with that crap because I don't know how

[01:53:14.010 --> 01:53:19.410]
He used to be hot that was Blackie he used to be Blackie on General Hospital John Stamos General Hospital

[01:53:20.010 --> 01:53:23.750]
I didn't say you did all right Rick Springfield was on that show too and so was Richie Simmons

[01:53:24.890 --> 01:53:29.710]
Yes he was on General Hospital well I wonder if he was chasing Rick Springfield around I know I should probably

[01:53:29.710 --> 01:53:33.150]
I sure would have been I just chased him till I caught him

[01:53:35.370 --> 01:53:37.870]
This one says don't know how you feel about Sean Penn

[01:53:37.870 --> 01:53:42.210]
But I saw milk last night with a wife and I would have to say I have to say

[01:53:42.210 --> 01:53:45.030]
He was very good in a very good movie you should check it out about Harvey Milk

[01:53:45.450 --> 01:53:46.770]
Hey Harvey oh

[01:53:48.990 --> 01:53:52.830]
PS Bluebell ice cream is amazing in my humble opinion try cookies and cream

[01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:58.630]
Just what I need is you know more more pushing on a bluebell ice cream I don't need any more ice cream

[01:53:59.630 --> 01:54:05.830]
Oh and I had another oh I had a pint of ice cream from the little Chinese market again and again it was

[01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:08.030]
It had been thawed and re-frozen

[01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:13.970]
I should take it over there and say hey maybe no speaking English but you speak it in this language and just dump it on her head

[01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:22.290]
I don't need the freezer compartment you know the juice went out overnight one day

[01:54:22.290 --> 01:54:27.190]
And then they just they just plugged it back in and re-frozen everything they don't care

[01:54:27.190 --> 01:54:33.150]
They don't care they got stuff in that store when you look at the expiration date it's got like 1802

[01:54:33.150 --> 01:54:37.630]
I mean there's there's like pasta sauce in there to expiration date 2003

[01:54:39.230 --> 01:54:51.670]
When you buy stuff that was like six years old I might I'm a schlepper just let you know it's actual the is Dennis says this one and not to take whoever

[01:54:51.670 --> 01:54:55.130]

Why don't you head to the nearest oh I see that's cute very amusing

[01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:13.190]
Why do you find it hard to believe oh I see a poll who do you find it hardest to believe is married to a member of the opposite sex

[01:55:14.130 --> 01:55:21.010]
Poll suggestion beast Josh Darrow he's not married yet Tommy Cruz George Rodriguez need more names

[01:55:22.230 --> 01:55:25.590]
Bad poll you think please

[01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:31.770]

[01:55:51.630 --> 01:55:55.530]
And those scrappy thigh-highs and the wind just blew over my coachy

[01:55:55.530 --> 01:56:03.690]
Ha ha even though the economy is decimal and I run things to be crambling I feel exuberant and excited like a 13 year old girl going to see twilight

[01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:09.410]
Ha ha ha welcome to three CEOs of the automobile industry to hunt bar got our Malawi and porn

[01:56:18.570 --> 01:56:25.850]
That's nice name's Wagon yeah, it's like a station wagon. That's funny. No, no, I think it's funny. Maybe not a percent to him anyway

[01:56:25.850 --> 01:56:31.470]
Let's go to you. I was don't you think it's funny to Richard Wagon his last name is actually from station wagon

Why is it in June guys flew on private jets into get your big bail out money?

[01:56:50.810 --> 01:56:56.450]
Don't you think that says the American people screw you? I think it's not a say screw you American people

[01:56:56.450 --> 01:57:01.230]
Well, I don't get me wrong. I'm a big believer in spend spend spend but that's kind of crazy right?

Yes, I do really think go ahead. Go ahead.

[01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:33.830]
Go ahead. What I'm trying to say but that's Robert Nadelian the same question. Nadelian wait a minute. Just hit me.

[01:57:53.690 --> 01:58:02.510]
You can't let me sound like I'm back in Rowley. I think I had some vodka sauce and not daily last night.

[01:58:22.450 --> 01:58:24.510]
Chris Matthews played hot ball. I miss them.

[01:58:28.970 --> 01:58:54.490]
I'm not a bad guy. I'm not a bad guy. I'm not a bad guy. I'm not a bad guy. I'm not a bad guy. I'm not a bad guy. I'm not a bad guy. I'm not a bad guy. I'm not a bad guy. I'm not a bad guy.

[01:59:16.450 --> 01:59:24.430]
hah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:34.110]
some of this stuff. Whoa. You ready for that? I am. Because we got an hour and 12 minutes

[01:59:34.110 --> 01:59:40.890]
to kill. The emails are like down to a crawl. Neil at neorodges.com. He goes emails coming.

[01:59:41.230 --> 01:59:46.130]
I'll start writing something now. No, you won't. I know. Dan says Dickie Vibit was funny.

[01:59:46.190 --> 01:59:49.510]
You know how all that Dickie Vibit is? Older than a thoo's low. Yeah. Somebody needs

[01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:54.830]
to tie his hands around his back when he's on TV. It's like he's waving in an airliner.

[01:59:54.990 --> 01:59:58.850]
Whatever that means. I don't know what that means. I don't care. Dickie Vibit is a funny

[01:59:58.850 --> 02:00:03.950]
but it's old. Now did I play that because DA had him on the ear or something like that?

[02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:11.470]
That's exactly why that's exactly why. Oh my God. We had Dickie V on this station. Yes.

[02:00:12.710 --> 02:00:17.450]
He's not as annoying as Pierre McGuire but he's almost... Now he's more annoying.

[02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:24.750]
Pierre McGuire. Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa. Oh my God.

[02:00:25.050 --> 02:00:31.470]
These guys who talk like they're getting paid by the word. These people are evil. They're

[02:00:31.470 --> 02:00:37.490]
part of the asses of evil. For 101 votes on the pool on the new pool. That's not so bad.

[02:00:37.490 --> 02:00:43.030]
You know not too shabby. We'll take it. Not great. Not like 45,000 like they when they take a

[02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:48.990]
poll across the street with those losers. We could have whatever results we want to have.

[02:00:49.090 --> 02:00:54.610]
That's right. We could have four million votes on there. And so can anyone else. They then don't

[02:00:54.610 --> 02:00:58.350]
show you how many they've got. That's right. They just pretend they make up a number and they say,

[02:00:58.370 --> 02:01:03.830]
oh well George Sennano got 24,000 votes on his put. Yeah. Let's see it.

[02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:10.910]
Let me tell you right now. Anybody that takes polls and just shows percentages and doesn't

[02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:15.390]
show you the number of votes they're lying. They're like Jimmy Sifilittic. There's another one.

[02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:20.030]
What's he used to do the same thing? Only his polls will be under for like a month. What's the

[02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:25.270]
best we need in town? I guess footy turnout to be the best we need in town. What a turd.

[02:01:26.490 --> 02:01:27.850]
Cute. What? Good line.

[02:01:31.270 --> 02:01:37.350]
What is what is happening to you? I'm I'm hearing this before my very ears. What? I don't know.

[02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:42.590]
You just last week or so strange. All right. I mean, you've always been strange. Then again,

[02:01:42.650 --> 02:01:45.650]
aren't we all? Whatever you say stranger than usual. Whatever you say.

[02:01:51.210 --> 02:01:56.190]
Yeah. You don't think? No. Pretty weak on these emails.

[02:01:57.850 --> 02:02:06.470]
All here's one. Just want to find those Mickey bet, bet, bets. Thank you. Have a good. I'm your

[02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:11.250]
friend. That's it. They're not lost. Yeah. They're not lost and we're not playing them. I'm your

[02:02:11.250 --> 02:02:18.130]
friend. It says. Great. Well, I asked and I'm getting they're out of material for the day. It's

[02:02:18.130 --> 02:02:24.710]
all right. Don't forget to join George Friday. 10 to 2 at Gulf Stream for the big show.

[02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:31.110]
Right. And Steve Sloan who you know, it's one thing to push a little bit, but when you push too hard,

[02:02:31.110 --> 02:02:35.570]
remember that song by the seeds you're pushing too hard. Remember that? That's Steve Sloan. He's a

[02:02:35.570 --> 02:02:41.310]
good guy, but he he sends me the form. And why he's doing on Wednesday. I have no idea.

[02:02:42.370 --> 02:02:47.770]
The racing form for the first and second race Friday. Because I'm going to be there. We're betting

[02:02:47.770 --> 02:02:57.490]
both. We went through this before. Yeah. But that was up on 20 losing its bluster. And that's no

[02:02:57.490 --> 02:03:02.890]
bluster. Remember Mr. Bluster from Howdy Doody? No. Well, why not? Just because you're not 100 years

[02:03:02.890 --> 02:03:12.990]
old like me. Hi there, Mr. Doody. Mr. Doody. That Buffalo Bob. He's still dead by the way,

[02:03:12.990 --> 02:03:20.790]
Buffalo Bob Smith. And you know, the interesting part of it is no. He was from Buffalo. Coincidence? No.

[02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:29.210]
I mean, there are guys, you know, like with fake names like that. But Buffalo Bob, he was the

[02:03:29.210 --> 02:03:42.390]
original. He was a Buffalo guy. Well, hi there, Mr. Doody. I wonder if the kids caught on when they

[02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:45.770]
were moving and how he was speaking. I think the kids probably caught on was he one of those

[02:03:47.010 --> 02:03:51.510]
one or what? Like a bad ventriloquist. Well, you didn't see it on camera. No, I didn't.

[02:03:52.750 --> 02:03:57.090]
When Howdy was talking just saw Howdy Doody with the ice in and then that was I think that was the only

[02:03:57.970 --> 02:04:04.610]
puppet show where you saw the strings. You know what I mean? Right. Like Cook's a friend in

[02:04:04.610 --> 02:04:11.230]
Oli. Of course, those weren't puppets. They were sock puppets. Right. Those are puppets. Howdy Doody

[02:04:11.230 --> 02:04:15.850]
was a Marionette. Oh, I actually excuse me. Those are puppets. Correct. And what about

[02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:20.270]
senior wenches? Oh, he did all kinds of things. I don't know what you call that. The blips.

[02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:26.250]
Tick-tick. Sawdy. Sawdy. Sawdy. He was good. He was funny. He was I saw him in person. I told you,

[02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:31.770]
it's your key up at the palace theater. And what's he? All right. New York. He was all right. He was

[02:04:31.770 --> 02:04:37.130]
really. Oh, right. Yeah. Judy Garland and senior wenches was the opening act for Judy Garland.

[02:04:37.130 --> 02:04:45.270]
I was just a little kid. During your show last Friday, you stayed at the basketball was invented

[02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:52.530]
in Canada. Well, yes and no says somebody. Reese. According to Wikipedia, it was invented by a frog

[02:04:52.530 --> 02:04:58.190]
named Dr. James Nasemith, a Canadian PE professor from McGill University of Montreal. You know who

[02:04:58.190 --> 02:05:01.850]
went to McGill University? No. William Schatner. Okay.

[02:05:05.110 --> 02:05:09.230]
Yeah. Well, he was at biography a couple of minutes ago. And he talked about how he got beat up

[02:05:09.230 --> 02:05:14.470]
as a kid because he was Jewish. However, the first basketball court was at Springfield College.

[02:05:14.890 --> 02:05:20.010]
The game was played December 1891 in Springfield, mass. And I'm sure was broadcast in WQIM

[02:05:21.470 --> 02:05:26.650]
with clearance and Joe is a gag gag gag gag gag. Don't forget one thing. What?

[02:05:27.310 --> 02:05:32.290]
Jersey gaggy sucks. Okay. Wikipedia also says that volleyball was first played near Springfield

[02:05:32.290 --> 02:05:38.690]
in the town of Holyoke. Holyoke mass. Just FYI if anybody really gives a cure. Okay. Thanks,

[02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:43.570]
his Reese. Well, thanks, Reese. So Canadian guy invented basketball, but the first actual court

[02:05:44.170 --> 02:05:55.430]
was in Springfield, mass. What a scam that used to be WBZ and WBZA Boston Springfield. They

[02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:58.790]
could cover the western part of the state in the daytime. That would be to BZ.

[02:05:59.790 --> 02:06:03.710]
And then the FCC one day said, you know what? This isn't kosher. How do we ever agree to this?

[02:06:03.710 --> 02:06:09.010]
And they said, take that thing down, man. Shut it off. Now, when's our new power power come?

[02:06:09.250 --> 02:06:12.850]
I'll let you know when I know. Oh my God. We won't you won't have to let me know because

[02:06:12.850 --> 02:06:16.270]
somebody will call and say, Hey, guess what? We can actually hear you now. You ought to somebody.

[02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:22.990]
I am born a spadler. Since fearless leader has won the Tasha in I know long to have to look for a

[02:06:22.990 --> 02:06:27.670]
motion squatter. Instead, we listen to the near-roger's fair and balanced one to two hour.

[02:06:28.410 --> 02:06:35.470]
Hi, I'm Joey D, formerly of Joey D in the Starlight. I'm also founder of the Rock and Roll

[02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:51.350]
101 at 560 WQAM. I was thinking of playing a whole bunch of jingles. Really? I was looking at

[02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:58.530]
about that 77. Well, as a matter of fact, I got an email from somebody. Stacy, she said,

[02:07:58.530 --> 02:08:28.510]
sing along with you. 77. WABC that hits her on us. So that inspired me to start looking up

[02:08:59.050 --> 02:09:13.010]
to 8BC. Go, go, go. CKW. Golden. Solid gold hits. Straight from the gold mine. 77. Solid gold ABC.

[02:09:17.930 --> 02:09:23.910]

[02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:26.990]
Duda.

[02:09:35.250 --> 02:09:46.110]
Duda.

[02:09:54.130 --> 02:09:54.810]
All right

[02:09:56.750 --> 02:10:01.110]
103 at 560 W. Kim I haven't given the schedule for today and have I oh my god

[02:10:01.110 --> 02:10:03.610]
Well, first hour we were under a little bit of a duress

[02:10:05.730 --> 02:10:08.910]
First hour did the show on the blackboard on the phone didn't have no line

[02:10:09.730 --> 02:10:11.070]
Line crap time wireless

[02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:13.910]
I beg your pardon we were wireless

[02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:18.090]
I always wanted a wireless mic there you go. Yeah

[02:10:18.910 --> 02:10:21.990]
Anyway, what do we got today the big O at the Sony Ericsson?

[02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:26.290]
Is that another stupid golf tournament? I'd add it. Oh

[02:10:26.290 --> 02:10:27.770]
My god, are you kidding me?

[02:10:28.490 --> 02:10:33.570]
Then we got mad dog 4 to 7 golf in the night 7 to wait the worst tune out in the history of radio 8 to 9

[02:10:33.570 --> 02:10:41.590]
We got hurricane hotline 9 to 10. It's the high school gridiron report and then 4 DA with no signal tries to follow that 10 to midnight 4 DA

[02:10:42.970 --> 02:10:47.830]
Wow how much he's waiting on pins and needles for that new stick to go up

[02:10:49.250 --> 02:10:53.230]
That was up 140 waiting for the new stick yes, I am stick it

[02:10:55.650 --> 02:10:57.830]
So you hear nothing about that no, I haven't

[02:10:59.270 --> 02:11:03.590]
I mean, did you even know that we're doing that from you? Yeah, see I mean I talk about

[02:11:05.070 --> 02:11:06.350]
These things kind of like

[02:11:07.410 --> 02:11:12.830]
circuitously because I don't know if they're supposed to be a big secret whether everybody in this tree knows it that we're doing something

[02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:16.770]
I don't know I don't know because when they don't talk to you and tell you well

[02:11:16.770 --> 02:11:21.770]
He did but Joe Bell did call and tell me that so maybe it was our last phone conversation what?

[02:11:22.390 --> 02:11:27.130]
Maybe it's not a secret. It is a secret. Oh, then that we're putting up a new thing

[02:11:28.170 --> 02:11:32.330]
And we're increasing our power gonna and people be actually be able to hear us. Well, that'd be something

[02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:34.910]
Then we can play a happy day all day every day

[02:11:36.190 --> 02:11:37.670]
By the Edwin Hawkins singers

[02:11:39.690 --> 02:11:45.170]
Vegas Dave says the movie and you know, I've had no comment about that list of I mean I realized there's a hundred movies on there

[02:11:46.290 --> 02:11:50.750]
No comment about the top 100 movies of all time and how come this was not a yell like that usually is

[02:11:52.270 --> 02:11:57.090]
Vegas Dave says the movie dad starring Jack lemon and Ted Danson is amazingly moving and

[02:11:57.830 --> 02:12:02.870]
Is the usually wouldn't dance in his best performance to date? Don't think I ever heard it mentioned never seen it

[02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:06.790]

You ever see dad no, I saw the like add the trailer for it. Yeah

[02:12:14.570 --> 02:12:16.930]
But that's all I

[02:12:16.930 --> 02:12:17.510]
heard good things

[02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:27.670]
Yeah, that's it such as what you just heard that it's a good movie and that it's moving and I don't know if I want to see it

[02:12:27.670 --> 02:12:34.110]
I don't know if I want to be so it's tear jerker. I guess I you know, I'm not gonna run to see something like that. Oh boy

[02:12:38.130 --> 02:12:41.890]
By the way said go find something else to do besides sending me stupid emails

[02:12:44.650 --> 02:12:46.610]
They got an old-fashioned toilet

[02:12:47.530 --> 02:12:54.730]
And then the year the chain yeah the box in the chain have you ever seen a toilet like that? Yes, I have you have

[02:12:54.730 --> 02:12:58.170]
I've been in some real backwards areas as you know

[02:13:00.170 --> 02:13:06.490]
And you saw a toilet with a ball on a chain like like one of those I think what they're talking about is the toilet where the

[02:13:06.490 --> 02:13:11.650]
The tank is way up high. I wonder if anybody's doing the old chain ball in that place probably

[02:13:12.170 --> 02:13:14.850]
But yes, I've seen them. I've encountered them. Wow

[02:13:16.230 --> 02:13:20.810]

My friend Adam Kirschner knows how to reach me whenever he wants to

[02:13:34.270 --> 02:13:37.630]
Well, he wouldn't call you up and say what's wrong with you George? You're not the same old George

[02:13:37.630 --> 02:13:41.430]
He wouldn't do that. He knows there's nothing wrong with me and so no he wouldn't no

[02:13:42.330 --> 02:13:51.030]
Is there anything wrong with you? Is there anything wrong with him? What's he doing nowadays working at the Sun Sentinel still goose stepping and Nazi parades still still

[02:13:52.810 --> 02:13:57.470]

[02:14:52.330 --> 02:14:53.330]
Jesus God

[02:14:55.070 --> 02:14:56.530]
Now you might take that one

[02:14:57.510 --> 02:15:02.510]
No, there's one page is like twisted in half

[02:15:04.510 --> 02:15:05.470]
Here we go

[02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:11.090]
I got a smooth fine operation going on here if I do say so myself I

[02:15:12.570 --> 02:15:18.510]
Think this is worth an extra couple million year just the fact that I'm running this studio and do such a magnificent job of it and

[02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:20.990]
Still haven't expense them anything yet for the stuff

[02:15:22.530 --> 02:15:28.730]
Bruce and pop it obit says how can you honestly say that George Cow was a bad broadcaster easy because he was horrendous

[02:15:29.710 --> 02:15:33.710]
Growing up in Toledo in the 60s and 70s. I used to love to listen to George when he called Tiger games

[02:15:33.710 --> 02:15:36.370]
I thought he was the best when your taste is in your tockos Bruce

[02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:42.730]
I can still hear him say and here's here comes Willie in his Arkansas draw Willie Horton

[02:15:42.730 --> 02:15:47.990]
Or they're gonna wave him in or there's a long ride to deep center field. It just didn't get any better than George

[02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:54.050]
I suppose you thought that van Patrick and Ray Lane were bad too. No, van Patrick was great and Ray Lane was okay

[02:15:54.050 --> 02:16:01.110]
Shame on you. It says you know shame on me because I don't agree with you really bad bad taste and broadcasting your taste sucks Bruce

[02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:03.950]
If

[02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:08.530]
Rocking get on and then we get a couple of bingles and then they for Norman can hit one and start

[02:16:08.530 --> 02:16:14.350]
I mean just just ridiculous nonsense with a with an annoying draw the likes of which you've never heard

[02:16:14.350 --> 02:16:16.990]
He made Dr. Phil sound like a big city slicker

[02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:21.990]
That's George Kale great ball player horrible broadcaster horrible

[02:16:22.970 --> 02:16:26.430]
How can you say it honestly because that's my opinion Bruce?

[02:16:29.250 --> 02:16:30.210]
Good God

[02:16:31.130 --> 02:16:33.150]
This is this is what happens when you grew up in Toledo

[02:16:34.710 --> 02:16:38.350]
I mean, would you admit it if you grew up in Toledo? I wouldn't I keep it a secret

[02:16:40.090 --> 02:16:47.110]
Okay, I grew up in Rochester, which isn't saying much. It's not a great city, but compared to Toledo Rochester's like Manhattan. It's like Rome

[02:16:48.990 --> 02:16:50.070]
It's like paradise

[02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:51.990]
compared to Toledo

[02:16:55.590 --> 02:16:57.030]

[02:19:19.950 --> 02:19:21.070]
Oh

[02:19:21.070 --> 02:19:24.090]

[02:19:27.610 --> 02:19:31.010]
Because everyone's afraid to tear on MTV

[02:19:34.250 --> 02:19:35.430]

[02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:03.410]

In 1970 be claim one of the labels first major crossover hits performed by a white artist

[02:21:11.130 --> 02:21:17.590]
How do you like that even Motown had some whiteies there? How do you like them apples? All right. I never seen him

[02:21:19.450 --> 02:21:22.470]
His apples I never saw examples or his

Speaking of EO here's a picture of a guy that somebody emailed me mr. Yamaguchi

[02:23:56.050 --> 02:24:00.590]

[02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:04.470]
The chronic and cocoa sent this thank you chronic

[02:24:15.710 --> 02:24:19.510]
Su tomu yaga mochi Yamaguchi excuse me

August August 6 1945 when he was playing throughout the first atom bomb. Oh, no bomb agrande

[02:24:30.310 --> 02:24:35.790]
He suffered serious burns spent a night there before we turned to his home city of Nagasaki just before it was bombed

[02:24:35.790 --> 02:24:38.650]
August 9th boy talk about being in a wrong place at the right time

[02:24:41.070 --> 02:24:44.370]
But he don't look all that bad for 93. I don't know when this picture was taken

[02:24:44.370 --> 02:24:45.450]
I mean he looks like an old

[02:24:45.970 --> 02:24:46.510]
Jap, you know

[02:24:47.710 --> 02:24:51.050]
He said he hoped his experience held a lesson of peace for future generations

[02:24:52.290 --> 02:24:55.210]
Well, what does that mean? I don't know

[02:24:55.810 --> 02:25:01.750]
His experience has a lesson of peace sure piece of one piece of shimit

[02:25:02.490 --> 02:25:09.170]
It was already recorded that mr. Yamaguchi and survive the Nagasaki bomb, but on Tuesday officials recognize he'd been in Hiroshima as well

[02:25:10.390 --> 02:25:11.490]
certification is a

[02:25:12.670 --> 02:25:19.290]
Himakusha or radiation survivor qualifies Japanese citizens for government compensation including medical checkups and funeral costs

[02:25:21.010 --> 02:25:23.110]

About 140,000 people were killed in Hiroshima 70,000 and I got Nagasaki

[02:26:03.150 --> 02:26:08.770]
Many survivors fell sick with radiation related illnesses and putting cancers for years after the bombings

[02:26:10.830 --> 02:26:14.030]
It was a classic example of the barbarism of mankind

[02:26:15.430 --> 02:26:17.130]
Wow, what though do you mean by that?

[02:26:18.030 --> 02:26:18.650]

Even 90 points up now 95 point 58 see as soon as I started talking about it people started buying

[02:26:56.890 --> 02:26:59.710]
It's a buying opportunity is Maria B would say that bitch

I thought you said nothing on their part

[02:32:56.370 --> 02:33:01.850]
Oh the only reason that the show got on and with the open and everything like that is because I was running around like a lunatic

[02:33:01.850 --> 02:33:04.510]
Trying to get it going and getting you on the phone again

[02:33:04.510 --> 02:33:08.370]

I only got about three more pieces here really crisp. I wonder why this happened

[02:33:55.510 --> 02:33:58.150]
I want it because usually it comes out like a little rubbery

[02:33:58.850 --> 02:33:59.910]
Maybe you cooked it a little

[02:33:59.910 --> 02:34:05.110]
Can you hear how crisp it is? Yeah, did you cook it at the same amount of time? Yeah 99 seconds

[02:34:05.730 --> 02:34:07.270]
Maybe they changed the formula

[02:34:08.410 --> 02:34:08.850]
No

[02:34:09.430 --> 02:34:11.930]

That's a lot I believe that ice cream he says it's one of the most addictive foods out there and it should only be available in small doses

[02:35:44.850 --> 02:35:47.090]
And with a prescription that is correct

[02:35:47.090 --> 02:35:52.150]
There are more people dying from eating ice cream and candy than there are from a taken prescription drugs

[02:35:52.150 --> 02:35:54.810]
Am I right absolute no question? I mean

[02:35:55.430 --> 02:36:00.030]

I mean here was a guy who was fooling himself and it didn't work out

[02:36:12.510 --> 02:36:15.610]
If I got there at the track before he did in the dining room, I would tell the

[02:36:16.530 --> 02:36:21.610]
I would tell the waiter take the rolls off the table because I sure wasn't eating them because I don't eat bread

[02:36:23.330 --> 02:36:25.310]
And then I'm eating carbs. It's sure ain't going to be bread

[02:36:27.310 --> 02:36:31.710]
Here we take the rolls off the table put them on the one across the table from us rich would get there

[02:36:32.170 --> 02:36:34.850]

You know, it's it's the greatest thing for sliced bread and then just when you get used to eating it then they stop

[02:42:14.210 --> 02:42:17.630]
