[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.040]
Oh, yeah, everybody in town even George is on the Gator bandwagon

[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.640]

[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.580]
Yeah, and they were always nice to me. So therefore therefore by default to fi am going to a give a crap

Anyway, we got the big ol' it to a clock this afternoon despised and reviled by the entire audience and I have no idea why what do they got against him?

[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.660]

[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.260]
I'm maybe mad dog four to seven fifteen at Dolphin Stadium

[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.140]

Detroit

[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.940]
A detroit elementary school is asking for donations of toilet paper and light bulbs to keep their school functioning

[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.480]
The principle of the Academy of America sent a letter to staff parents and partners

[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.260]
asking for donations of items that are of the utmost importance for proper school functioning and most important for student health and safety

[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.820]

[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.880]
In the letter principal Naomi Colliel

[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.400]
Sighted budget constraints within the district is the reason why the school could no longer stock the items budget constraints like here at Q.A.M

[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:44.020]
No toilet paper no paper clips no paper towels no nothing none of these things can't afford them budget cuts

[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.340]
The district is grappling with more than a four hundred million dollar budget deficit is on the verge of being assigned an emergency

When you think of the kind of for toilet paper stick to the 60 watts let the kids read in the dark

[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.060]

[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.340]
Although you know like you say they're all for real is that what you always say that's right and

[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.140]
Today's pull now do you add Ronald McDonald on there? I mean, that's so obvious no not yet

[00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.800]

[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.820]
Skin hanging out

[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.400]
It's like week one hamburger at a time

[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:50.460]
It was a false alarm was just a Oprah raspberry wasn't that's what it was yeah, she sat on a whoopee cushion

[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:57.440]
That must be it and went whoopee anyway, I changed the poll soon. That's a word about frosted flakes in the this and that's a horrible poll anyway

[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.080]
And and Eric's gonna have to take the cocoa crisps off the

[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.880]
He did oh nice going Eric off the new poll

[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:13.400]
We were just having a conversation about putting it back the other way so that I could add Ronald McDonald when you changed it

[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.240]
Yeah, well because it's a it's a crappy poll

[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.360]
One ad or mascot influenced you to buy the most

[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:26.980]
573 votes total tally final Tony the tiger frosted place 164 the only reason I voted for that

[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:33.260]
Because I love frosted flakes. I don't eat cereal. I don't buy it because I can I can eat it under the box

[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:38.460]
I try to avoid it, but I eat two giant bowls of cinnamon toast crunch last night

[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:44.060]
Just because it's the first crunch. What is that it's like golden grams with cinnamon and sugar on oh god?

[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.440]
It was wonderful, but

[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:52.120]

[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.180]
I don't really like sugar smacks. They're like moushy. Yes, right?

[00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:02.080]

Yeah, very little known character there really yeah

[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.000]
Okay, the new poll is up there. It's a survey and

[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:15.820]
Basically we're out of polls so and whatever ones I didn't use like the ones from

[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.240]
brand from

[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.600]
Not Brandon. Well Brandon's got a message on here. So the one from Charlie B

[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.340]
There were a couple other ones and the one from your buddy in holly was Sean

[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:32.440]
There were a couple really crappy ones. So I didn't use them. I'm not quite a of course you have a Virgil Salato drop says

[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.800]
He we hit him with five shots and he's still alive

[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.060]
Look at what where is it?

[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.660]
Sonny gets it. Oh here it is right here. Oh you got it

[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.840]
They're in with five shots and he's still alive

[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.760]
That's bad luck for me

[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.340]
In bad luck for you if you don't make it

[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.200]
You know what's sunny

[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:01.400]
Let's see and Brandon says in jenko was the unedited version of the first movie that's only been aired on TV

[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:07.600]
Vita and all the sons including Tom and Johnny visited him in the hospital on the name of Connie's wedding because he was dying and

[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:12.940]
I'd expect to survive the night so they went to pay the respects. I wonder if Enzo the Baker stood in the doorway

[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.500]
Thanks Brandon

[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.280]
Otherwise, we never would have found that Salato drop he was good. Yeah, Turk. Yes

[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:25.620]
I still like the way he had the like those alligator teeth speaking of the gators. He had those alligator teeth like oh

[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:26.880]
Yes

[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:33.540]
And danger is that Luca? Wow look at this boy today. She was just awful. I

[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.420]
Wonder why Neil's been solo on energy since the return from vacation

[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:42.200]
Today's show is just we won't even on for like 20 minutes. Well, it's just awful. Yeah

[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.560]
I'm usually a happy kind of guy but this week when listening to Neil

[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:51.200]
It made my energy levels plummet. Neil, please take something for your depression. St. John's wart will do the trick

[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.580]
I'm not the least bit depressed

[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.860]
I'm in a really good mood today got 30 votes on the new pool

[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.160]
Which we'll get to momentarily

[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.520]
But first we have to pay respects to Tony Cigreto

[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.000]
Well, first of all before that one

[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.520]
Here's one from your friend Porter week and Ralph who I keep thinking I'm blocking. I should block

[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:16.900]
Do I sound like I'm low on energy to you? No, just not the least bit just a little the best I haven't about the two weeks

[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.920]
Good getting rid of that crud

[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.660]
Been sick as a dog in this a hole takes the time to write oh Neil today show is just awful

[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:31.400]
More negativity from South Florida negative a holes rotten miserable negative a holes

[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.460]
But I understand you trapped and you can't get out. I get it. I got out

[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.840]
PR Ralph says okay. I have an issue

[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.700]
Ken Maldon is gone not a peep from the station of the sports nerds at the station

[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.960]
Now is he officially gone?

[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.920]
I think so because because when Hank called me by accident that day when I was down there

[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:54.960]
He said that he called clearance in Tudum and ass and that the clearance claimed that we're gonna get Ken some a part-time stuff

[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.040]
Now do we have any way of knowing whether they did or not? I do not

[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.200]
Let me look at the schedule

[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:10.580]
I don't see him anywhere in the schedule this weekend and I tend to believe the clearance probably just told Hank that to get him off the phone

[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:17.200]
Anyway, well we miss Ken Maldon. He's a great guy and I already paid him great tribute and the homage and respect and

[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:23.320]
We're very sorry the way they screwed him over the way they turned him over and they stuffed a hot poker right deep inside his back-to-body

[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:32.940]
A PR Ralph says Tony Cigarette was last day is tomorrow and they've made the a vigil the whole week last night with Melan head sucking up to him

[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.160]
Oh, not Melan head

[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.600]
Oh, are you kidding me?

[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.940]
You know Melan head don't you know?

[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.960]
I dumped the bitch right now. Oh, that's no one like John McCain would say that one

[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.300]
Ralph says sorry

[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.820]
I like Ken better than Tony Cigarette. I don't never even met Ken

[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:57.800]
But sounds like a good guy. Well, he is a great guy not a good guy a great guy and a real professional and a a bench a real bench

[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:06.000]
But they stuck it to him because number one he's Jewish and number two probably probably farted in jolly joe bells face one time

[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.900]
John a long time listener

[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.360]
goes on

[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.520]
About Tony Cigarette. I better to do justice to this. I better do it after the break

[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:21.460]
Okay, I don't want to read the two facts. It's long right long and ponderous and it's interesting when you get about three quarters of the way through

[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.200]
He says I just want you to see Tony Cigarette. Oh the way I do I don't

[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.460]
Isn't that amazing? They would they want me to say this they want me to think that they want me to do do do I'm not gonna do that

[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.300]
Just like think I would is Israel crap that I'll get to eventually

[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.660]
About I better say this and I better say that screw you

[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:43.840]
41 votes on the new pool other than Neil which QAM showed you listen to the most we've done this many many times

[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.720]
41 votes. I only listen to Neil 21 Jim men which eight Joe rose seven

[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:54.860]
I don't listen to QM at all three now the reason I put that on here is because we've discovered ill over the years that there are people to vote on our polls

[00:21:54.860 --> 00:22:01.840]
Who don't listen to the station right right that is correct don't you find that bizarre it's interesting but no not really oh

But you don't care because for the next five minutes you are a marble man

With the money you'd save on cigarettes alone you could put down a down payment on a new condo

[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.060]

It starts out about me, but then it morphs into you

[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.960]
Neil FYI typically the symptoms of a cold occurred two to five days after infection

[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.600]
So you most likely did not catch it on the plane

[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:16.640]
But rather from one of the Arabs Chinese or Mexicans in your building also tell George that marijuana weekends your immune system

[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.060]
Which is probably why he is sick so frequently?

[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.720]
I see so here's a email telling you what to do and what not to do okay?

[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:31.700]
Don't smoke and don't do they actually it actually strengthens my immunity to other things does it really yes

Aren't you tired of all the bubble my sees yes, I'm not interested in Bubba

[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:25.400]
If he wants to if he wants to use somebody else to show to promote his crap his redneck crap find somebody else

[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:32.360]
71 votes on our poll other than the old what the which WQM showed you listen to the most I only listen to needle 41

[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.060]
57.7%

[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:40.820]
exclusive cum which would mean mean a lot if we had a lot of people listening but we don't anymore stations vanishing from your rated in fact

[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.860]
The whole radio is just vanishing from our lives

[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:51.740]
Jim mandates 12 Joe Rose 11 and I'll listen to QM at all three the big O's got appear ESPN radio one dolphin hotline one and

[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.500]

[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:55.660]
none

[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.700]
Not one not not too many but none nobody

[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.320]
What's the problem with him?

[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:08.220]
Don't ask me the fact is that Joe Bell brought him in anything Joe Bell brings in

[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:09.580]
fails

[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:16.920]
Why is that maybe the minus touch and reverse maybe

[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.200]
Tony says well, this is the more the same crap. Oh

[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.540]
I I like the guy said I don't have any energy. I'm weakened by the audience

[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.540]
Tony says why are you not unserious?

[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:34.020]
I'm stuck in this Mickey Mouse town Orlando with nothing but Yahoo's on the radio

[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:40.220]
I got serious in my new Dodge Nitro and I'm so disappointed you aren't on are you considering the possibility of satellite?

[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.860]
No, they're not considering me and satellites gonna be out of business very soon anyway sometime this year

[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:50.240]
Or are you just gonna continue to milk terrestrial radio can't blame you if you do now?

[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.560]
What does that mean continue to milk terrestrial radio? Are you milking it?

[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.540]
I'm taking a 50% paid cut

[00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:02.020]
I just made out my first deposit with my new reduced amount and I just like I mean not that I'm starving

[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.480]
I'm still making some pretty damn good bucks, but oh my god

[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:11.700]
I don't care who it is when somebody reduces your income by 50% that's a real blow if I can use that word

[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.500]
Can I say blow no no low blow?

[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.100]
Can't blame you if you do also if any South Libyan's are considering moving up here to Orlando

[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.020]
Please tell them to see a good shrink really fast

[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:22.240]
Tony

[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.400]
Now Tony says I'm listening online. Please tell me about this. He's listening online

[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.600]
So what's the problem? What do I need to be on serious for they don't have any money Tony? Don't you understand?

[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.160]
They don't have any money howards got all the money

[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.760]
There's there stock is a

[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:44.520]
Resounding 14 cents as we speak it was down to 12 cents over the weekend now it's bounced way back up to 14 cents a share

[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.760]
Love you Neil, but need you on serious police is Tony. Well, what is that mean?

[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.640]
Get on there what you want a serious get on there. There you go

[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.280]
They don't want me. I don't want them. How do you that that's the way it works Tony?

[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.340]
I need them like a looking cup is the Chinese month say oh, sorry up

[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:07.780]
Ron Paulie old Ron and not Paulie be upset. I'm assuming their material Chinese one

[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:14.140]
Can you believe that he yeah, I can he's just shameless? Okay, let's get back to the Tony cigarette openness

[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.620]
Now you a big Tony cigarette oh fan me yeah, I don't know for many of these people

[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:22.740]
Big years

[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:28.180]
No, I know who it is, but see people who are newscasters people who read the news on television

[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:34.180]
It could be anyone or anybody or nobody it could use to read the sports. They're interchangeable as far as I'm there

[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.920]
Might as well have news reading robots. They're interchangeable people

[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:43.820]
John John says hi Neil. I'm a long time listener. I've sent you one email since you started the email portion of your show

[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.820]
Well, they're pretty grim and slim today. I'll tell you that I well the holidays are over folks

[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:55.540]
No more Chanukah and Christmas and and oh, let me tell you about a scam. I asked you about this off the Iran

[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.060]
Tuesday morning

[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.300]
About this January 5th or 6th thing where it's like a certain certain

[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.100]
Net that you celebrate like three kings day it

[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:10.640]
Translate yeah, so it's another excuse to go out and buy everybody a whole bunch of gifts for the kids

[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:17.380]
Okay, sure. Yeah three kings my ass. It's a very optional and most of us have opted out of it

[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:21.460]
It's a very old world old-fashioned like Mexican. I

[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:26.220]
Guess good excuse to go out and spend money. I guess anyway

[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.580]
John says the reason I'm writing this email to you is to give a lot of credit to Tony Segredo

[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.400]
I just realized that he's retiring. Hey Tony

[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:34.880]
I

[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.040]
Know you don't think much of him, but I wanted to speak my mind

[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.180]
Anyone who stays in this community for as long as Tony has deserves a lot of credit

[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.860]
I'm not a big fan of his jog and hears

[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.260]
But the man is shown a loyalty to the community and to his family

[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.520]
Oh, what does that mean?

[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.960]
I know you probably think that I know him, but I don't know I don't think you know him

[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:02.240]
I just think you're like obsessed with his ears. You got to fetish for silly people with big ears

[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:08.220]
Just as there are people who don't like you they can argue they can't argue the fact of your service and loyalty to the community

[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.780]
I don't have any loyalty to the community. I haven't even lived there for the last seven years most of it

[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.120]
I loyalty to the community. I can't stand south for it

[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.980]
I despise it makes me nauseous my stomach starts churning when I think about having to be there

[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.220]
loyalty and

[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.720]
My service this is a job. This is a just like his is a job

[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:32.760]
It's a job John. We're not doing a public service. We're not like coming on every day so that we can like

[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.260]
Help make the world a better place. It's a job

[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:42.680]
I know that a lot of your show is sick, but I think you should acknowledge the fact that Tony is given the majority of his life to this community

[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.100]
But what what does that mean? I don't know

[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.600]
I know he's made a good living, but that's not the point yet. It is the point. That is exact. That's the whole point

[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.160]
I'm a native of South Florida. I'm 47 years old was born and raised in Miami Beach

[00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:01.480]
I think it's a good thing for someone to stay at home and give back to the community when you stay there and I'll stay here

[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.340]
How do you like that John?

[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:08.580]
Now here comes the best part of this. I'm not telling you how to think. I know that's not possible

[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:14.980]
But here comes the I underline this sentence can't wait. I just want you to see Tony cigarette over the way I do

[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.700]
Through TV on the TV

[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.820]
Yeah, by turning on the TV and turning on channel six

[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:28.500]
I don't see him the way you do. I don't envision that. He's a goofy guy. I don't dislike Tony. I mean I know him

[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.740]
He was on my show a hundred years ago him and the Humper

[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.840]
Someone who was damn lucky enough to work where he grew up

[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.340]
Um, well, whatever that means. I love your show. Hope you're not going anywhere

[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:44.320]
But give credit where it's due. Tony's been around for a long time just like yourself

[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.660]
You're both fixtures in the South Florida community. I hope you give them credit. He deserves all the credit to you Tony

[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:50.960]
Rechire

[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:52.480]
Sincerely John

[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.360]
I I just I'm sorry. I don't get it

[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.620]
Yeah, he's been around a long time. He's been a fixture. He's been there

[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:04.300]
He's a silly goofy guy who used to be the sports nerd and then you know and then he became a newsreader

[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.900]
You can't complain about his credibility because generally speaking he doesn't have any

[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.340]
I don't want to rip Tony at the time he's retiring. That's bad

[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.980]
But that's what you got me to do John

[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:17.840]
You inspired me to rip him and ask because he's got big ears. I never even thought about his big ears

[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.340]
He's goofy looking looks like he belongs in the circus

[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:25.060]
I mean you think okay. Oh here's look at this

[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.700]
Neal's depression can be explained readily great

[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.600]
Well, this is a new format

[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:43.060]
What do you mean by that we can psychoanalyze you for the next five years. Yeah, let's analize old Neil. I'll get to it

[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:17.520]
Hey

[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:17.540]
Well

[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.320]
Nothing

[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:24.080]
It starts with perfect black paint and paint

[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.240]
We're talking to the story for the slam of crime

[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:32.320]
That no one's gonna actually die, die, die, die, die, die, die

[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:37.240]
Oh yeah, just as good as I'm before the towers went down

[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.780]
Boy tower was a soggy ground

[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.940]
And for making all that corporate money on our blood

[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.380]
We're even looking too bad now

[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.980]
We're up to two to two bad

[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.340]
We're worth the criminal Round

[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.880]
Back to, do do back to, do do back to do do

[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.320]
Dude dude dude dude

[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.280]
Hey I got our witty, great inspirational idea

[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.660]
Let's start the do-off shop

[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.340]
Alright

[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.080]
Who is that lighting one, one big problem with that

[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:11.900]
A I don't like do-off

[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.320]
Most of it it sucks

[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.500]
Yeah, sl owns the same

[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:15.860]
Yeah

[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.940]
Who is the guy that used to do that to do Wapshop?

[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.360]
I don't know.

[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:20.820]
Yeah, you do.

[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:21.400]
No, I don't.

[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:27.840]
If somebody told us the name, you talked about him all the time, and I would say, yeah, that guy, but I didn't remember it then, and I don't do Wapshop.

[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:28.100]

[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:34.480]
And then I think he had a show on Magic once upon a time on the weekend, and then the Schmidt-Cand is asked.

[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:39.680]
Of course, in this business, if you're around long enough, sooner or later, most people will get their Ash-Mid-Cand.

[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.220]
I never had my Ash-Mid-Cand in this market.

[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.720]
I'll tell you that I've been here a long time.

[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.860]
March 1st is 33 years.

[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.860]
Our big anniversary show.

[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:48.520]
Anybody care?

[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:48.740]
No.

[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.160]
Any interest?

[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:49.420]
No.

[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.380]
Let's get a whole bunch of emails about Tony Cigaretteau.

[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:52.620]
Okay?

[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:53.180]
You like him?

[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:53.620]
You hate him?

[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.460]
You don't give a crap?

[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.280]
You got big ears?

[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.520]
Is he a goofy silly guy?

[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.440]
He's a silly guy.

[00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.400]
He's a silly guy.

[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.220]
You know what I don't know.

[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.080]
You know what I mean by silly?

[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:04.560]
I do.

[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.080]
It's hard to take silly people seriously.

[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.380]
Doesn't mean I dislike him.

[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.280]
I don't dislike him.

[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:09.940]
He's okay.

[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.240]
He never saw a freight train.

[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.280]
It's not like when he comes on the air, and I'm if I'm down there.

[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.260]
And by the way, who are these?

[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.420]
Every time I come down here, there's a whole bunch of new Barbie doll heads on the air.

[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:19.460]
Doing the news.

[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.820]
Who are these people?

[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.320]
I don't know.

[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.160]
Jason says, like Tony Cigaretteau, I grew up in South Florida and still live and work here.

[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.040]
The difference is that I'm trying to get the F out.

[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:28.780]
Love your show.

[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:29.320]
Take care.

[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.240]
Good luck to you, Jason.

[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:35.200]
Thanks for your refreshing honesty, as opposed to, oh, you're just sour, Neil.

[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.460]
You're just random.

[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.460]
And by the way, don't wait for any phone calls today.

[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.980]
George tells me his calls yesterday were sensational.

[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:42.020]
Sensational.

[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.880]
That's because you get the world on fire.

[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:44.420]
That's right.

[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.540]
You get all the intellectuals.

[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.680]
I get.

[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:47.580]
I'm your friend.

[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:48.880]
I'm your friend.

[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:50.420]
Hi, Ron.

[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:51.900]
Hi, Ron.

[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:52.220]

[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.560]
Maybe it's your energy level, you know.

[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.780]
Yeah, maybe if I get my energy.

[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:55.820]
Well, here you go.

[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.100]
Well, you must be psychic.

[00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.720]
Here's this email.

[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.340]
Neil's depression can be explained easily.

[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.460]
This is from a Kimby Mambogani.

[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:04.540]
Wow.

[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.220]
Wow.

[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:06.460]
What?

[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:09.700]
It's not a bank of Nigeria solicitation.

[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:10.300]
No.

[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.260]
I had a whole bunch of those this morning.

[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.220]
I don't get any real emails anymore from.

[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.300]
I don't even get the fake, uh, this one or fake that one anymore.

[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.460]
I just get those ones you're talking about.

[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.740]
Oh, I mean, log goes to Nigeria and I've got $80 trillion.

[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.820]
And you can have it if you just send me your shoes, eyes, no, that.

[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.960]
I get, oh, how, how is that possible?

[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.120]
So much of that's going on.

[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.680]
Must be a lot of really stupid people.

[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:33.220]
Yes.

[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:37.200]
Anyway, here's one that says, heard someone in the email saying that Neil is low energy this week.

[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.940]
The explanation for this is simple.

[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.620]
You know, I'm sitting here.

[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.420]
I sound like I always do to me.

[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.260]
I mean, I don't know.

[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.160]
Do I sound different than I usually do?

[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:45.520]
Nope.

[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.300]
I sure it's all sound a lot better than I did on Tuesday when I was choking in that last hour.

[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.620]
I never thought I'd make it through.

[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:54.420]
All that post nasal drip, man.

[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.100]
And you're trying to talk and it's dripping down in your throat.

[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.580]
Yeah, like that.

[00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.240]
Coffee spell.

[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.640]
I didn't think you were going to come back from that one.

[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.400]
That's what I'm saying.

[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.080]
So I'm sure you weren't shocked when I texted you yesterday morning said, please do the show.

[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:06.760]
I'm sick of so.

[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:08.320]
And by the way, I will tell you this.

[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.700]
It ties right in with this email.

[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.920]
Because you don't need to talk to the machines.

[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.880]
So yesterday it was snowing and.

[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.120]
It was slushing.

[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:20.980]
You know what?

[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.400]
It's like a combination of snow and rain.

[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.180]
It was slushing.

[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.500]
So I called my lesbian.

[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.800]
He's cabbie in at nine o'clock.

[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:27.960]
We got a quarter nine.

[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.500]
We headed off to woodbine.

[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.700]
And there was nobody there.

[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.200]
Nobody.

[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.600]
And I won 1,200 bucks.

[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.020]
How do you like that?

[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:38.700]
Very good.

[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:39.920]
Isn't that good?

[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.600]
So that goes to show you that this.

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.420]
Anyway, it says the explanation for his low energy is simple.

[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.540]
Neil is a gambler.

[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.560]
And his major win a few weeks ago,

[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.060]
because I'm experienced gamblers high.

[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.440]
What major win was that?

[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:54.680]
I don't recall that one.

[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.260]
Now he's going through the low.

[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.740]
This is normal and nothing to worry about.

[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.720]
When he'll hit the jackpot, I want jackpot is that.

[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:03.920]
I don't know.

[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.640]
Do you remember me hitting a big jackpot?

[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.420]
No, I don't.

[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:12.100]
His brain released massive amounts of serotonin and endorphins causing the chemicals to be depleted.

[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.640]
If my calculations are right, he should be back to normal in about 1.3 weeks.

[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:16.980]
Good luck, Neil.

[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:17.880]
Eat a lot of ice cream.

[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.820]
I recommend double fudge brownie by E.D.s to all my patients.

[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:21.860]
Thank you and God bless.

[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:23.120]
Oh, it's from Reds Kelten.

[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.340]
God bless.

[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:24.780]
Very nice.

[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.620]
I don't like E.D.s.

[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.880]
And especially I don't like fudge anything or brownie.

[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.500]
I do like fudge.

[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.200]
I don't like brownie ice cream.

[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:38.560]
You're like even Ben and Jerry's with chunks of brownies in it.

[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.040]
I mean, if you want to eat brownies, go ahead and eat brownies.

[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:41.840]
I like brownies.

[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.540]
But not an ice cream.

[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:45.060]
Right?

[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:45.660]
Right.

[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.200]
It's like grapes.

[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.720]
I like grapes, but I don't like grapes in ice cream.

[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.500]
It's like halava.

[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.660]
I do like halava, but not an ice cream.

[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.020]
I was speaking to that, liking halava.

[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.900]
Here's this email that came in at 10.08 yesterday morning.

[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:05.460]
Subject, prideful Jewish man, with, with, I'm sure, a fake name, Jack, with fake last name.

[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:06.460]
Mm-hmm.

[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:06.740]
What?

[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:08.440]
Fake.

[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.220]
I'm agreeing with you.

[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.020]
I'm 43 years old and proud to be Jewish.

[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.980]
My heritage is full of great accomplishments and great people.

[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:19.680]
Why you have chosen to defend the Palestinians and bash Israel for their actions is beyond me.

[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.220]
When did I defend the Palestinians?

[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.440]
Except the ones who are starving and getting putrid.

[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.140]
You see how you are?

[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.460]
You know very well how many Jews, here, I want you to listen to this very carefully.

[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.560]
You know very well how many Jews have died at the hands of Egyptians, Romans, Christians, Germans, at all.

[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.100]
The scales of justice haven't come into balance yet.

[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.300]
The scales of justice.

[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.360]
Less than 100 civilians does not mean Israel's committing war crimes against the Palestinians.

[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.400]
Now it's like over, what is it?

[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.600]
Almost 800 dead and 3000 injured?

[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:57.760]
The outrage is completely disproportionate to the actual harm alleged to be portrayed against these people.

[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.200]
Right, alleged harm.

[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.100]
Like the people who are allegedly dead.

[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.140]
Your parents and your grandparents are ashamed to have raised you in the Jewish tradition.

[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.240]
My parents and my grandparents aren't ashamed of anything because they're all dead.

[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:11.280]
They're dead.

[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.160]
Unfortunately you are not ashamed of your words which is a disgrace.

[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:15.960]
No, I am not.

[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.260]
A shame.

[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.560]
Learn to be a Jew again and defend the people being pelted by rocks and kept up at night by blurring sirens.

[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.420]
Support the actions by Israel.

[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:32.200]
If you don't, I will be forced to alert some of my fellow activists to protest outside your station and make life for the people they're quite unbearable.

[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:38.020]
Israel is in the right and Israel is in the right and you have to swallow your pride and admit it.

[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.840]
It's sincerely Jack Foney name.

[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.580]
And I emailed him back which I rarely do.

[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:44.780]
I said hold your breath.

[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.780]
Never got a response to that one though.

[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.620]
Probably because it's a fake maybe he's still holding his breath.

[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.340]
Yeah, keep holding it Jack.

[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:54.800]
Hold it tight.

[00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:00.380]
You'll do what I tell you to do and you'll see what this is the essence of what most of the emails have become.

[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.020]
It didn't take long.

[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.500]
The birthday and the election.

[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.940]
That was the right at the same time within two days span.

[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:12.760]
November 4 and 5 and I had dozens, maybe hundreds of emails and happy birthday and congratulations to us in Obama won.

[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.200]
And you were right in the beginning and you and all this other stuff.

[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:15.700]
That was it.

[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.520]
That was pretty much the end of that.

[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.300]
Oh, Stu Goldstein.

[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.620]
Thanks, fake Larry.

[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:25.000]
Fake Larry is obsessed wasn't the on WBCG.

[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.260]
I don't know and I don't care.

[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.900]
Fake Larry who is probably Mr. Radio.

[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:30.160]
Do Bob.

[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:33.880]
Stu Goldstein.

[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.820]
No, here's one from a mic but you're wrong.

[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.580]
Mike Glad to hear your feeling better today.

[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.400]
George was great as usual in your absence.

[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.960]
Also Ken Held is the new off DJ you're thinking of take care of Mike.

[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.860]
Now Ken Held I remember what he had.

[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:48.380]
No, it doesn't sound right.

[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.360]
He played short stuff for the Indians.

[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:49.900]
He was cute.

[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.220]
Remember what he held?

[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:52.620]
No.

[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.380]
Oh, but Ken Held I never heard of.

[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:55.840]
Neither.

[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.140]
And he was not the new off guy.

[00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.000]
I was to Goldstein.

[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.840]
Mike just might just forgot him because you know Goldstein Goldstein Jewish.

[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:04.240]
I say.

[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.140]
Oh, and by the way, Diane Feinstein.

[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:11.480]
It's not Feinstein who has been lately saying these news readers on TV on CNN.

[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:12.560]
Feinstein.

[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:18.480]
I don't know anybody who pronounces that name Feinstein.

[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:19.780]
Feinstein.

[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.120]
Remember the conversation we had about this few weeks ago?

[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.920]
We did Goldstein and Goldstein.

[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.140]
Well, there are Goldsteens and Goldsteens but there are no Feinsteens.

[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.060]
I don't think there might be.

[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.920]
Alex Dean.

[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.840]
They finally dumped his ass.

[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.440]
By the way, how about those leaps in the Panthers?

[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.260]
Yeah, then I told you the leaf sucked.

[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.980]
The make believes.

[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.480]
Stu Goldstein.

[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.760]
You don't remember that name?

[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:48.460]
Nope.

[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.060]
You like this?

[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.160]
Paul says.

[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.560]
I love the show every day and usually tune out if I hear George's voice.

[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.840]
I decided to stomach the show yesterday and really enjoyed it.

[00:42:59.080 --> 00:42:59.540]
Wow.

[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:04.500]
I honestly don't know why I never liked hearing George before but after yesterday I realized that George is a true radio talent.

[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:05.920]
Thanks for the entertainment, sis Paul.

[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:10.000]
I'm waiting for this tour rent of tribute to come in to Tony's cigarette.

[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.820]
He's retiring tomorrow's his last news show on Channel 6.

[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000]
Are you going to hold your breath?

[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:15.880]
What?

[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.480]
Well, that's what that John guy said.

[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.380]
You know, pay your respects to Tony's cigarette.

[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.440]
I'm giving people a chance he's been on the air in a market for a hundred years.

[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:28.640]
Say something nice for crying out loud instead of just giving me and George instructions on life.

[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:31.660]
Oh, you sound very depressed in them.

[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.100]
Yeah.

[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.040]
And even your emails don't give me the rest.

[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:35.700]
How do you like that?

[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.760]
To show you what a what a survivor I am.

[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.900]
And by the way, jolly, Joe, I did show up again today.

[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:42.600]
How do you like that?

[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:43.340]
You fad ass.

[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.940]
This is the neo-Rodger show.

[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:47.780]
You-you-you-you-you-you-you failed.

[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:48.720]
This is your brain.

[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.640]
Any question?

[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.820]
Do you see the size of my zucchini?

[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.800]
Do you think they are away?

[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.620]
Hey, you're like children here!

[00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.220]
I used to do the girls

[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:04.080]
Me and my wives and I'd lay the wood

[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:07.660]
Without a warning my de-hankle

[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.120]
Need to see that I used to go

[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.420]
Why the wonder-boner is here?

[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.700]
At least I could use my penis as a polka stick

[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:18.420]
It feels like it's just a piece of meat hanging down

[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:22.060]
I used to glue with twides

[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.240]
I used to sleep here in my girlfriend's eyes

[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.840]
It used to be my proudest name

[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.320]
How my old thing was lit, long as in me

[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.580]
I'll get it again for me

[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:38.740]
It was tall but hard quickly

[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:43.180]
Then I just felt it that my callous tones

[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:46.560]
Did not help it all my poor little friend

[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.360]
I hear fire and repeal so working

[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.660]
Don't don't see all this work

[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:53.880]
Keep me jerky

[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.220]
Feel my fear that my song will yield

[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.640]
A cap of the lily is a club

[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:04.100]
So no one, call the reason I've got no game

[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.780]
So that's doing was better

[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.860]
Better when I do work

[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.500]
That was when I do the good work

[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:17.060]
It sort of looks like a smirk penis

[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.700]
I told you you need to double toast to my hanger to get wood

[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.220]
1202 and 560 WDQM, but that was sure a push

[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.080]
It wasn't a little bit

[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.780]
I was pushing the old envelope

[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.120]
Well, scroll you joy-sploat out your ugly ass

[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.380]
You retard

[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.120]
Finklery King says I'll excuse the insult

[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.480]
I'm not the chronic Mr. Radio

[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.820]
Mr. Radio has disappeared

[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.640]
So the year is off to a really good start

[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.460]
A self-proclaimed oldies freak

[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:44.560]
Stu Goldstein hosted a 50s talk in music show

[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:54.120]
From 1984 to 1999 on several soft photos stations including WIOD, WKAT and WAZY

[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.920]
What is that?

[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.360]
Did you ever hear of WAZY?

[00:45:58.560 --> 00:45:58.680]
No

[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.540]
I remember WAZXY, which we still got

[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.140]
Although it's on A.M. now and used to be on FM

[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:08.840]
He also co-authored the book Oldies but Goodies, The Rock and Roll Years

[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:09.880]
Woo!

[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:17.880]
And remember he was trying to use this show as a kind of a word for his displeasure when he got candid magic

[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:21.800]
Remember that?

[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.660]
Sending faxes in and ripping Bob Hamilton and asked

[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.620]
Well, Bob Hamilton has gone the only problem as so as Stu Goldstein

[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:31.680]
What's with all the Tony Cigarette Ola emails?

[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.760]
The man's been on the air in this market for 600 years

[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.980]
And that John Guy wants us to pay tribute to Tony Cigarette Ola

[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:38.780]
And you people, nothing!

[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:44.060]
God, you are heartless bastards or maybe just don't like him

[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.240]
Or we don't care

[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:45.360]
Or we don't care

[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.440]
Or we don't care about what?

[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.460]
About who reads the news?

[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.040]
You know, you are shameful

[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.100]
Well, I guess it was on several times during the holidays

[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:59.580]
On NBC, filling in for Brian Williams, Lester Holt

[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:00.120]
Okay

[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:07.760]
He is a thousand times better newsreader and just better on the year than Lester than Brian Williams

[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:10.880]
You don't agree?

[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.760]
I don't care about newsreaders

[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:15.160]
Why not?

[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.120]
I will be a robot

[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.760]
They are all the same to me

[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.460]
So you are saying that like Elliot Rodriguez in Channel 4

[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:30.260]
Look, let's take a pretty punum

[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.440]
I don't even take notice

[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.780]
Is the same as Jennifer Slapy-Valapy?

[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:34.700]
Might as well be

[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:35.100]
Is that what you are saying?

[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:35.620]
Might as well be

[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:36.500]
I see

[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:39.820]
Well, maybe Elliot Rodriguez is Slapy, who knows?

[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:40.420]
Probably

[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.360]
Here is one that says you were well enough for Woodbine yesterday but not to do the show

[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:45.060]
Hookie

[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:45.640]
Uh-huh

[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.340]
Yeah, what's the succession of Hookie?

[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:50.220]
I got news for you, I don't need to talk to go to Woodbine

[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:55.660]
As long as I'm breathing, I'm well enough to go to the casino

[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:59.360]
When I was down there I went to Hard Rock 4 times in the Pompey-No Couple nights

[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:03.660]
To go on to Gulfstream they would have hooked me up with a really good machine but too far

[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.180]
Oh and speaking of that we got the things starting tomorrow now

[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.140]
Are we talking about that now or what?

[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:10.260]
We can, yes

[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.540]
Because this is going to be a trial run anyway

[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.440]
What do you mean by that?

[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.760]
Practice, practice makes perfect

[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.140]
We've got a pick the ponies promotion with Gulfstream Park starting tomorrow

[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.700]
Well, not really starting tomorrow

[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:26.820]
It's like a dry run

[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:27.240]
Right

[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.840]
Listers will go to wqm.com, register on a contest page

[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.700]
We'll pick a contestant every Friday, now how are we going to do that?

[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:36.580]
However we want

[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.420]
Well, I mean how do you pick one?

[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:44.980]
I assume that there's a form there if you can register online that there's a list of form

[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:48.840]
And then we can draw names out of the hat or pick somebody randomly or through a dart at a board or something

[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.800]
Yeah, think about that, Flee, think about how this is going to work

[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:56.020]
Uh-whatever, whichever contestant we pick gets a $50 win voucher

[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:59.260]
And then I'll pick a winner for the second race at Gulfstream that day on Friday

[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:04.380]
And then we'll have the call of the race on a year and if the horse I pick wins

[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.760]
The contestant gets the winnings, $50 to win on that horse, correct

[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.800]
And Steve Sloan's emailing me the Friday Racing Formula Rethers Day afternoon

[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:16.780]
And I'll have to sit there and pour over the form and pick and hand me a lot of pressure on me

[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:17.380]
I'll say to that

[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:19.840]
Right, so you can just use the same dart on the thing, you know

[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.360]
Pick a horse the same way we're going to pick a contestant

[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:28.160]
Do you know how absolutely wonderful it is to walk in any casino where there are slot machines

[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:32.140]
And there's almost nobody there and you can play any machine in the whole place

[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:32.500]
Wow

[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:36.420]
And then you can find a good machine man, which I did

[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.740]
And Reake says it would be great if you guys could turn the archives into a podcast

[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:43.860]
We, they are in Reake

[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:48.640]
That way listeners could subscribe and automatically get the latest news

[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.420]
Ah, autumn, oh my god

[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.360]
Right click, save target as and there it is, subscribe my ass

[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:56.560]
No

[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.580]
Click it, it's there, click it, you got it

[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:04.140]
And you don't only require setting up an RSS feed with links to the audio files

[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:07.000]
Very easy would be a great boost for your shows and Reake

[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:12.180]
It's called taking something very simple and making it movie complicato

[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:13.760]
Am I right?

[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:14.220]
Yes

[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.440]
What are you getting all bent out of shape about?

[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.220]
Because he's because you know Eric does give me all the press again

[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:22.420]
I don't have to go off to live by

[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.720]
Oh geez, there goes your energy level

[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.340]
Get my endorphins all whipped up

[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.420]
Because Eric doesn't have to do that make those archives available the way that he does

[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:30.240]
I'll nice and organize the way that they are

[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.480]
Oh here's Mr. Radio

[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.020]
Mr. Radio

[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:35.300]
And he sends me a picture

[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.300]
I'm still around you old Koot Stugoldstein was known as the Keeper of the Keys

[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:40.840]
That's right

[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:47.980]
And here's a picture from an old IOD remote with a big IOD banner and back

[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:49.320]
Let me see if I recognize the people

[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:00.520]
I don't recognize anybody unless the less that Stugoldstein there

[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.520]
The Keeper of the Keys remember that?

[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:04.140]
Nope

[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:09.140]
The Keeper of the Keys to he was like from the same era as Eddie Kay and Kaplan

[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:14.000]
And they both got screwed over see if you're in this business eventually you get screwed big time

[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.720]
Like eventually you wind up working for Joe Bill

[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.600]
Who's a heartless rotten fat ass bastard

[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:23.040]
I mean that's not just for on the air I mean that's just reality

[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:25.260]
That's not stick

[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.160]
Of course they never believe anything we see anyway

[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:31.520]
Oh you guys must make all this stuff up like the thing with Moe you know

[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.800]
How could you make him up?

[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:34.520]
Right

[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:39.460]
How could anybody even with the most living and vivid imagination like I've got

[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:44.880]
Make up a Moe Howard David it did did did did do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:49.060]
Fake great Jackass as if you remember Tony cigarette who used to be on Miami Hurricanes radio broadcast

[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:54.160]
Was sunny Hersh on the once great W I O D on the once great

[00:51:55.260 --> 00:52:01.760]
Well a lot of things used to be great like this station used to be great and then they'd say brought in jolly Joe

[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:05.640]
That thing with Greg Reed man. I hope that it was something really serious

[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.440]
You know what I mean

[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.980]
Well in other words when they blew him out and forced him into like other endeavors

[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:17.420]
Which they never say they fire anybody you know it's always well he's moving on to other

[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.900]
I he's gonna be a consultant you know

[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.880]
When they did that that was the kiss of death and they brought in this goofball

[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:32.960]
I mean nobody's perfect but every single thing he's done since he's arrived on the scene I don't want to get started on him again why did you do that to me?

[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.340]
That's how I am the bastard.

[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:48.600]
Nothing about Tony cigarette from any of you people out there we got at least 50 60 people listening and nobody has got anything nice or even nasty to say about Tony cigarette who was retiring tomorrow after 600 years on the year doing stupid sports crap and reading the news on channel six

[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.440]
Which used to be on channel four

[00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:59.580]
In fact it seems to me that Tony used to be the sports nerd when Ralph redneck was still doing the news on the old channel four and WTVJ

[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:02.920]
Which what back and then was channel four on Bob Weaver was around

[00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:04.900]
And Ralph redneck

[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:09.920]
And who else was that and Jim rosemary I think was on that thing?

[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.840]
Or was Jim brought yeah he was on there and then he was on channel 10 I believe

[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:23.200]
But anyway Tony was the silly sports nerd on there when Ralph redneck was still alive doing the good night made the good news be orange

[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:23.460]
Oh

[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.800]
He was a um

[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.400]
I don't know is there word to describe Ralph redneck?

[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.640]
No not drunk I don't want to say that

[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.520]
Her lot of stories about his drinking air sports though

[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:44.920]
Yeah, I'm looking I'm still looking now I keep checking the outlooker's face you should hold your breath yeah

[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:52.460]
I don't know what that picture is supposed to be mr. Radio and of course he don't bother come back and tell me who it is or what it's all about

[00:53:53.060 --> 00:54:00.140]
179 votes on the survey other than Neil which WQM showed you listen to the most I only listen to Neil 89

[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:03.020]
49.7 percent under 50 percent

[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:07.660]
Jim man which 50 Joe rose 17. I don't listen to WQM at all 13

[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:12.560]
The big O6 Damon and Mandelara's got a pair finally he must have voted twice

[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:17.040]
ESPN Radio one and Dolphin's hotlines got one wow

[00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:22.400]
Somebody in the organization must have voted you think must be

[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:29.180]
All of this Tony the phony wouldn't you know it would be all these people to read the news like they had an original thought in their own

[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:32.800]
Our bunch of phonies all you have to do is show up and know how to read says Gus

[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:40.020]
Well, that's what George says just news readers anybody who can read a teleprompter what difference does it make?

[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:43.580]
It's like like there are performers like they're editing the news like they're

[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.280]
Comfortable with them. Okay. It's like why didn't people watch water?

[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:51.380]
Crank I don't know you tell me because he was like a grandpa, you know, he was comfortable

[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:56.000]
He was like an old shoe. It could have been anyone a comfortable old hat could have been anyone

[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:01.100]
But it was not as long as they can put one word after the other without fumbling and bumbling to

[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:08.400]
Would have been a fine without fume thing they can they can fumble a little bit like my good friend Marty Adler at the Windsor raceway the fume fear

[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:13.480]
Is that his name? You pay a pay a pay a pamphlet called it on a show a year ago

[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000]
Where when we were when I was down there Marty Adler don't remember that

[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:19.060]
Neither does anybody else

[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.400]
Hey Marty

[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.240]
The best time I keep on his clear right Marty

[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:28.780]
Only in the banana republic baby only in Miami

[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:41.660]
All right goodbye W. Bush got got to say it just my martial touch

[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:46.240]
Thanks for leaving us the legacy of your economy

[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:49.560]
The biggest bank heist in our history

[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.260]
The blood will wash off of your hands

[00:55:55.560 --> 00:56:00.280]
Complicit story retard 3000 dead by your income for two

[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:04.640]
Thousands more for your whimsical designer

[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:15.580]
We should build a grip that wishes to win here allowing you to stay for eight years

[00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:17.280]
If we had graves

[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:22.020]
We would have ousted you and your neocon friends

[00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:23.380]
Absolutely

[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:36.680]
With justice is served after you pass away like Larry Craig will tap dance on you

[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:37.080]
Yeah

[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:49.900]
1118 at 560 WQ and there's your new president the result has been a devastating loss of trust

[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:54.820]
And confidence in our economy our financial markets and our government

[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.160]
In other words I'm dying on the hands

[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:02.840]
Almost 200 tallies on our survey there. It's not too bad, huh

[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:03.780]
Right

[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:09.380]
You'll take anything you don't care. That's a way different that's right in different not about everything

[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:10.160]
No

[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:15.320]
Like you said paid in lead that's it other than that screw it it's a perfluous

[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:20.480]
Just Bob says the guy who wants Eric to make the archives into a podcast is a tard

[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.420]
I don't think it was that time

[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:31.900]
Yeah when you're right in a turd

[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:33.440]
Ha ha

[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.500]
Play everything is right there do it yourself schmuck

[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:41.880]
If you can't handle that you're too stupid to live but perfect for South Florida

[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:45.880]
Here's my tribute to Tony cigaretteo. It says he's no Joseph Gackie, but whatever

[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:47.460]
What

[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:52.440]
What what a great email that was good. It is a good email. That's why I read it

[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.960]
I mean them all pretty much

[00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:58.500]
Except the ones from the really they're not always fine

[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:02.100]
I beg your pardon they're not always funny. No, they're not

[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:03.860]
That was probably for me not always there either

[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:08.340]
I think generally speaking. I'm not going to keep begging and pleading because generally speaking

[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:12.700]
The other audience doesn't give a flying crap about Tony cigaretteo. They don't hate him

[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:16.640]
They don't love him. They just he was just there. You know, he's okay. Maybe it's an old primer thing

[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:22.980]
I don't know he's a what maybe it's an old timer thing to care about newscasters. I don't know. I don't know anyone who does

[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.540]
Mr. Radio says are you talking about Ken held?

[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:29.320]
What

[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:35.760]
What does that mean? Can you translate that to me? Somebody said Ken held was the do-op shop guy and I said no

[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.140]
It was a stew goldstein

[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:41.960]
Well, now we've got a battle between the fake Larry King and the fake Mr. Ray and the real Mr. Radio

[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:44.760]
God. Oh, here we go

[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:54.880]
Don I wonder if former WTVJ staff member CBS's Katie Kourk Fox sports as Chris Myers NBC's David Bloom rest in peace and lyric

[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:59.700]
King and Rick Stance has a CNN will be sending Tony cigarette or congratulations on his retirement tomorrow

[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:05.260]
I wonder if any of those folks got their salary cut in half this year. Neal says Don in La Belle Florida

[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.600]
I don't think David Bloom is going to be sending him anything because David's been dead for a long time

[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:14.640]
Remember he got the what is it pulmonary embolism in Iraq

[00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.880]
Okay, you don't remember David Bloom put it was that's right. He died

[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:20.260]
He died

[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:26.460]
From sitting in the tank to lie he said tank tanks a lot and sitting there a mobile and all of a sudden they're you know

[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:33.740]
So why is that I don't understand this do you understand this thing? I wonder if any of those folks got their salary cut in half this year

[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:36.960]
Neal I don't know you're not real happy about it. I'll tell you that

[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:42.400]
Oh, here we go. You need to shut up already God put George on already

[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:47.660]
Yes stuff to say when he talks about a topic he presents facts and important points to back his opinion

[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.960]
He does doesn't rip into whoever or whatever

[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:55.600]
He presents an argument you suck you just bitch and moan and complain don't make your listeners any smarter

[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:58.020]
Bapapah, it's all the same Schmidt with you

[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:04.520]
This station this station jolly joe bell jolly joe joe joe blah blah blah garbage. I'm tired of it

[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:09.100]
Give me something to listen to you're not the same crap all the time stop mailing it in my god

[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:12.200]
Just entertain me for Christ's dance monkey dance

[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:18.160]
George do something get your own show. Please. Oh, boy. Thanks mom. Yeah

[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.720]
Do something. Oh boy. That's the fakes email you've ever read

[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:27.680]
Yeah, how long did take you to write it? Oh

[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.340]
God Mary oh says

[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:34.980]
Happy new year Neal and George so we both get a little a little something a little tickle

[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:41.040]
Other than my friends other than my favorite uncle making more money and expanding his audience and appeal

[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:45.580]
The only other reason I wanted you to be on satellite would be to hear you anywhere. I may be

[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:46.460]
Oh

[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:52.060]
Will you people stop with this satellite crap already my god. It's just it's just ridiculous

[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.240]
Sure, I can listen online. But if I'm someplace where I don't have access to a computer

[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.320]
I would have to go without my fix of Neal

[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.880]
That's unacceptable in my opinion. Well, I asked the last guy who wrote about George

[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:10.380]
Who needs serious my brother turned me on the website radiotime.com that you can access from your phone and tune in pretty much any station in the country

[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.540]
You log on to the website

[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.920]
Input the zip code and all the stations have belonging to the market appear. This is great when traveling

[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.080]
This is how I listen to your show on them in my car since my cars AM signal is crap

[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.900]
And so is the station's AM signal crap

[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.880]
For example, I went to lunch at pizza. Oh yesterday. They were blurring the coast

[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.460]
I pulled out my phone start listening to George blasting Scientology was beautiful

[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:39.660]
I have a windows mobile phone and an unlimited data plan so I don't have any funky charges on my bill right

[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:43.020]
I'm really not sure how this would be on a regular cell phone

[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:46.360]
But no one has a regular cell phone since before Jesus was a baby correct

[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:52.480]
I just wanted to pass this along this useful info because it's a convenient way to listen to the best show and radio from anywhere

[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:57.160]
All you need is a cell phone with her in that access and that qualifies a lot of people

[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.220]
Sorry if someone's already brought this up. No, they did not

[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:04.380]
George did a great job and you asked yesterday as usual keep up the great work

[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:07.800]
How about some Mickey bits today no chance your goy-am friend Mirio

[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:13.720]
You're going for a day Mickey bit block last Friday. Oh did you well? That's enough

[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:19.060]
I'll always never keep the bastards happy for a long time you think even I'm getting real tired

[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:23.240]
Hi, you're hi, you know, I mean, you know, they were funny the first four on thousand times, but thanks Mario

[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:30.720]
The problems with the emails and not taking phone calls is that you don't get the sarcasm says Michael

[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:33.600]
I have sent two previous emails

[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.700]
dripping in sarcasm, but you took them seriously please take some calls no chance

[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.840]
Please take some calls not even pretty pleased am I taking any calls

[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:48.700]
How do you like that please take some calls I didn't understand the sarcasm

[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.160]
Yeah, I'm stupid

[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.400]
Well, we knew that

[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:59.340]
Here's one from the fake Larry again. I got one over on the maven mr. radio. I totally was through goldstein

[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:02.500]
A

[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:06.660]
Self proclaiming he already wrote this before about that I already read it and he wrote it

[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:12.620]
About stu-goldstein nobody cares mr. radio or our Larry whichever one you are whichever goofball you are

[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:20.480]
Uh say hurt we got the the show is so bad when I'm on and that's just the same old crap and then we get the the

[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.380]
Sothega who's just got to have his fixed no matter where he is

[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:32.640]
It's a radio show okay. It's a radio freaking show. It's not my life. It's name. It's your life and all you can say is I have no life oh my god

[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:35.620]
These people that are like

[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.400]
tragic

[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:44.540]
tragic one or two point seven how's Ricky Shah doing? I don't think he ever answered my my my space nobody nobody

[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:47.400]
I don't know yeah, yeah, I don't think he checks that no

[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:51.920]
Any of this anybody else I guess I guess anybody that's in the end of those

[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.360]
Interactive websites now it's on Facebook

[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:04.960]
Right yeah and my space is history. I mean I get a few every I have usually when I get his people wanting me to like good

[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.640]
Doing mobsters ink or some of the stupid crap like then I just delete those

[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:14.780]
Go away with your mobsters ink and all your other silly games. Okay games are for children

[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.320]
Yeah, oh here's the fake Larry again. I've been listening to Bubba since Monday

[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.660]
Once you get over the Yahoo ambiance. It's actually not bad

[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:29.680]
He mentioned your name again today saying every market as a guy who's been around a hundred years like Neil Rogers in Miami

[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:35.460]
He did a great bit today a clear channels expense has produced song parodies are good too. I'm glad you're enjoying it Larry

[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:39.520]
Get a life I have no life good God

[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.080]
Speaks in longwood who can't make up his mind whether he wants to be like you know

[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:51.160]
Contribute something positive or just be a chronic my team's better New York team one of those guys. I hate those guys

[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:57.540]
Speaks in longwood says I sure you're discussed with the people of South Florida's I moved away years ago and have been happy ever since

[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:04.200]
But was there ever a time you enjoyed South Florida thought it was a great place to live glad you're feeling better. It says Dan. Well, thanks Dan

[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:09.840]
Yeah, there was a time when I first came there 76

[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:15.840]
You know all that cruising in the 70s and 80s that think I want to hear about all the cruising

[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.420]
Yeah, all the hot gay sex gay like that

[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.640]
Yeah, once upon a time it was a pretty enjoyable place

[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:28.880]
I would say the really turning point was the Maryl boat lift. What was that 1980? Yes

[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.760]
1980 and after that it was just never the same again. Oh

[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:36.540]
You're now you're picking on the Cubans again. It's got nothing to do with the Cubans well does, but I mean

[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.320]
You know what I'm saying no

[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.460]
No, Maryl Boliv that was the turning point for South Florida. It's never and never recovered

[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:51.040]
And then of course all the Jews started fleeing from the South Beach all the old Jews moved to Voka and then all the

[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.600]
Every everything to every neighborhood changed North Miami Beach

[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.500]
North Miami am I right?

[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.100]
How should I know changing neighborhood? That's right because you're

[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.020]
Right you're in Hollywood

[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:08.340]
But you sure don't know your Tony Sugretto mr. I'll tell you I have

[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.400]
Living

[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:22.760]
Good morning Americans. It's Paul Harvey standby for news

[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:28.420]
Fail is a farmer who had three very beautiful daughters that were getting ready to go out on dates

[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:34.900]
The first boy came to the door and said I'm Eddie. I'm here to pick up Betty. We're going for spaghetti. Is she ready?

[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.120]
No

[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:37.680]
said Phil

[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:44.280]
The second boy came to the door and said I'm Joe. I'm here to pick up flow to take her to the show. Is she ready to go?

[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:45.200]
No

[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.240]
said Phil

[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:54.380]
The third came to the door and said to the farmer. Hello. My name is Chuck. So Phil shot him now page two

[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:58.060]
Two ducks go on a honeymoon. I'll say it again two ducks

[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:01.740]
Go on their honeymoon and stay in a beautiful hotel

[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:05.360]
As they're about to make love the male duck says oh well

[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:10.620]
Shucks we haven't got any condoms. I'll ring down the room service. So he calls and asks

[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:15.860]
For condoms you can see it coming can't you the woman says all right sir

[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:20.580]
Would you like me to put them on your bill? A no says the duck. I'll suffocate Paul Harvey

[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:27.520]
It could they love a thirty two at five sixty W. A. M. So anyway getting back to your favorite Scientologists

[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.560]
Yes, there's a website called Hollywood interrupted

[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:31.620]
Okay

[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:36.120]
And then there's an update on this since the kid died, but this is an older article

[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:40.180]
Hollywood interrupted reports they had an interview with a Florida man named Tim Kenny

[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:47.100]
Who lives and works in John Travolta's neighborhood and has intimate knowledge of the goings on behind the gates of the Travolta airport home

[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:53.680]
Kenny is concerned that Scientologists John Travolta and Kelly Pearson are ignoring their son Jets report a case of autism

[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:59.320]
So much the child protective services should be encouraged to get involved. I guess it's a little late now, huh? Yep

[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.220]
I don't think it's a stretch to call the treatment of jet child abuse

[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:06.620]
So california restaurant manager Tim Kenny tells Hollywood interrupted

[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:12.360]
Kenny claims he met Travolta at his restaurant in February and after comping the movie star in his daughter

[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:20.320]
Amel for restaurant policy for celebrities he asked him is one autistic child's father to another if he was doing anything special in terms of therapy for Jets

[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.700]
A guest Travolta responded well. We involve him in the arts

[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.420]
Then he offered to send Kenny a book and high-tailed it out of the restaurant

[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:34.520]
If I ever received a Scientology book from Travolta I'd find him and throw it back at him says Kenny

[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.140]
Scientology is keeping him from acknowledging his son's autism. They see it as a weakness

[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.920]
That's what the space aliens are telling him I guess

[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:49.140]
Repeated requests for John and Kelly to take part in a local charity event connected to watch his advocacy were

[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:50.420]
ignored

[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:57.860]
Furthermore, Hollywood interrupted reports the Kenny's also claimed that Kelly and John led jet sit in front of video games all day eating junk food

[01:08:57.860 --> 01:09:03.380]
While they eat the best organic food that money can buy they exclude jet from all social events because they're embarrassed

[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:09.440]
Once reports Kenny when Kelly took him to the movies that started to have a meltdown a Kelly pointed at the nanny and ordered

[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.100]
Take care of it. I wonder if that was the mail nanny

[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:13.620]
John's boyfriend

[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:17.340]
No comment jet does not speak at all confirms Kenny

[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:21.760]
He's not even been taught how to communicate we struggle every week to pay for our daughter's therapy

[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:26.640]
How dare Travolta ruin his own son's chances of recovering we want to get the word out on this too late

[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.080]
Have you liked that right problems all yeah

[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:36.260]
Good old Scientologists baby, but don't be knocking and they'll come knocking on your door

[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:39.780]
Your leg don't think a big dump on your doorstep. You'll see

[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:44.960]
They're rotten bastards. Mm-hmm. They like revenge a lot

[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.240]
225 votes the tallies on the survey

[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:50.220]
Oh, look at this the fake Greg Budell

[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:55.320]
Sirius was willing to offer you the option of rebroadcasting your existing WQM show plus a one day a week

[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:59.020]
Sirius only show in the sixth figure range. Why didn't norm entertain the offers?

[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:05.000]
I'll tell you why Greg because there weren't any that's why he didn't entertain the offers because there weren't any

[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.120]
There weren't any then there aren't any now

[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:10.000]
But I'm delighted to have you back with your fake emails

[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:17.860]
They were willing to offer me the option of rebroadcasting their existing show. This is all in in

[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:23.960]
These are lands somewhere. Mm-hmm. And never never land as it never never going to happen

[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:29.760]
That's correct as it never never did and was or what was not. Oh, you blew it. Why didn't norm entertain the offers?

[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.280]
Let me say it again very simple because there weren't any

[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:44.740]
Did you do this this one guy buys for it? He means well and he keeps sending me all I've already got that article in my pile just relax

[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:50.960]
See I'm not really all that interested for the most part and people sending me articles unless it's something really spectacular

[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:54.600]
I'm interested in having people say something oh

[01:10:54.600 --> 01:11:03.380]
Oh, I know yeah say something of their own not that somebody else said or that some article said for some cartoon that the audience can't see no

[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:08.120]
Dreaming the idea putting the emails on there was for somebody to actually say something

[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:14.820]
Which I would then pass along to the world and use on the air if they can't get it together to say something on the phone

[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:18.200]
How are they gonna do well, but it's a lot easier to sit and write something

[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:25.820]
As opposed to express it verbally. I mean they can't even write I'm your friend. They can't even write that out. Nope

[01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:28.660]
Well, why not difficult

[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.160]
I

[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:39.420]
Branden says I don't care about whether Tony leaves channel six but the sale of wtv j most likely got him scared and instead of being fired he just decided to step down

[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:46.040]
Maybe now he regrets seeing that the sale fell through and looks like the NBC will keep wtv j after all

[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:53.580]
Too much time to think Brandon too much time to think up to conjure up all these I mean who really cares

[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.660]
Obviously not too many people in this audience

[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:01.960]
Tony cigarette has been on the air for a thousand years now nothing to disable or even bad

[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:03.700]
nothing

[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:06.660]
shameful don't you think it's shameful

[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:08.220]
Whatever

[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:16.180]
Oh, and here's one that says an end predictable and how many times have you been in date county other than the airport in the past decade

[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:19.520]
Well a whole lot of times because the stations in date county

[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:25.640]
Since 1999 have you been in date at all of course you'll answer you can you can

[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:30.640]
Which is avoiding the point well? Well, well, what is the point? This starts out by saying and

[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:34.600]
As if there's something you like like predicating that that is left out

[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:39.880]
In addition to which who that wants to be in date county anyway

[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:42.920]
Not me no or me

[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:49.420]
Who that wants to be in date county and why and why do I have to be in date county? What does that got to do with anything

[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:53.380]
If you're like I said before if you like it there great

[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:59.060]
I'm not gonna sit here and try to convince you that it's this or that or whatever if you like it wherever you are

[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:01.820]
If you're in punks of tawny and you're having a great life good

[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:03.760]
I'm happy for you

[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:09.960]
I'm not one of those misrelives company kind of people like so many of the people in south Florida and here

[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:15.500]
I'm doing just fine the sun is shining most of the snow is gone and the life life is sweet

[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.060]
So they come over the flu the cold whatever the hell was 99% over it

[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:21.760]
But all these

[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:27.640]
Nasty sarcastic sour and when was the last time you were in date county? What do you know about yaddy?

[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:33.400]
I'm yaddy and it's people like them who make me so delighted that I'm long gone far away

[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.100]
I was in brown County last week all week

[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:43.060]
Mm-hmm was a good afternoon. What was a good for you? It was okay. I looked around. I saw a lot of old

[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:44.860]
grizzly people

[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:52.340]
The median age was still death plus 10 all you're wrong Neil the demographics are coming way down all the young people are coming down here

[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:53.600]
Yeah, all the people under 90

[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:57.040]
People between 75 and 90 are moving to south Florida

[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:04.800]
236 tallies on the pool other than Neil which QM showed he listened to the most I only listened to Neil 122

[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.280]
51.6 percent Jim Manward 64 Joe Rose only 24

[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:12.740]
I

[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:16.220]
Don't listen to wq M and all 15. Well screw you get off our pool

[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:23.320]
The big O6 the DA3 ESPN radio went and Dolphin hotline still got Solomon Te Uno

[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:25.960]
One prize on the best

[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:29.200]
I'm a year's I'll show you mine

[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:37.120]
Next on C span Nick Cheney's last official act as vice president the final dump

[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.200]
recalled by the vice president's chief of staff David Addie

[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:44.880]
Walking past his office. I get here the grunts

[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:50.440]
I felt I should ask you mr. Vice President. Are you all right?

[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.860]
With his heart condition I was concerned about a whining up like Elvis

[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.460]
Sounded like he was passing one of the many children he's devoured

[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:01.940]
Oh

[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:09.680]
I guess there's no harm in saying now that Dick Cheney's diet is of a

[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:14.900]
Cannibalistic nature much like Cannibal Ector only would have preference for young children

[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:22.840]
The vice president, um, please turn on the fan

[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:29.360]
Continuing coverage of Dick Cheney's final dump will continue after this

[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:32.180]
The George W. Bush Portupati library

[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.160]
Well, we got problems baby

[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:40.680]
We do yeah signal problems oh

[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:44.920]
Now if I had just one or two but now I'm starting to get a whole bunch of emails

[01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:50.520]
Surely who's a regular emailer says you're sure what's going in and out like a bad cell phone signal

[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:57.220]
And Brandon who obviously we can trust yes says you're off your off the air. I don't know for about five minutes

[01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.720]
And the Cuban music is very strong

[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:04.360]
Nick says the signal sucks today you're cutting out for minutes at a time hmm

[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:08.040]
Rudy says the radio signal keeps fading for the last 10 minutes

[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:13.700]
Can anybody hear us? Well, there's just a practice day anyway, right?

[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:19.820]
Maybe they're doing transmit or maintenance right now or maybe we're running about a few wants

[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:21.240]
He wants

[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.140]
How do you like that?

[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:33.280]
I mean, I've been doing this a long long time you know, I know that I'm old and boring and ponderous and yada yada yada

[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:37.720]
Also the crap of the fact that a matter is this that when people can't even hear the radio station

[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:41.840]
It's not usually a real real good career booster

[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:48.660]
You follow what I'm saying yep, it sucks it blows

[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:55.140]
Here's one that says um, oh, this is the guy that was ripping me about ripping Dave County

[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:57.320]
Of course, I never said anything about Dave County. Did I

[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:03.440]
Talking about taking it personally. No, I was talking about South Florida. I went and began to go in the toilet

[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:07.880]
That's what I was talking about

[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:14.500]
But anyway, this guy who was giving me crap for that says you were off the air and cutting it out between 1136 and 1140

[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:19.980]
So I couldn't hear your rant in response to my email ripping you for your unreasonably outdated stubborn view of Dave County

[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.640]
Let me say it again if you like Dave County stay there

[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:30.460]
That's what I said and of course, I don't know if we're like back on or not do we have any idea any inkling no

[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:35.080]
Anybody in the building with any spy reports about like like that

[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:40.100]
And they're also in a crystal go look oh wait. Oh Chris ain't there. That's right

[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.700]
Just us just me and George

[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.340]
And of course the rest of the buildings probably listen to the kiss they're probably kissing it

[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:52.520]
Oh speaking bad listening to the ticket if they work on this station. Oh, that's right ticket

[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.000]
Take a their their monitor in during this show. Yeah, that's what they call it

[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:58.400]
Um

[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.960]
Somebody sent this to me last night

[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:06.900]
Don't forget January the 8th, which is today is the king's birthday. Elvis is hillbilly royalty

[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:11.700]
Says this goofball do we care? No, are we playing Elvis? No, I could

[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.200]
Sound real good through that human interference

[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.800]
Elvis does La Cucaracha

[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:20.220]
Right yep

[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:25.340]
We got some real real technical problems going on didn't engineer come

[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:27.720]
Stick their head in the door and say anything. No

I'd like to have 75,000 current ones in there, but at the moment I got this one

[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:03.300]
Yep, it was definitely cutting out my want to let management know that it was even cutting out during the big old promo that played

[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:08.600]
They might actually do something about it then no, they won't do anything about it period. Okay. Oh

[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:14.040]
As if they care they're they're having in meetings. Don't you understand they're having important meetings

[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:17.760]

[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:21.840]
Yeah, so you get tired of being the walking joke right

[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.540]

But if he involved in some of those meetings

[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:04.180]
He's involved in some of them. I don't think he's involved in those seminars that they have every five minutes over there

[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:09.420]
Seminars sales seminars. I want to help a job on issue. I'll tell you that man

[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:15.840]
Remember what I said last year at one point I don't remember when it was

But I said that if the sales it's the sale situation regarding the show continue the same

[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:25.080]
And basically what they're doing is they're stealing all my avails. I have 16 evils every day and they're stealing them all

[01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:30.000]
Which is a lot easier than selling you know me

[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:19.600]
He was actually listening to the show that's why he came in here. So we have one. Oh, he's a good guy

[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:26.780]

See on the computer again

[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:04.560]
Well, why didn't I say a million times we're not talking about the internet stream?

[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:09.920]
Did I say that 50 million maybe not 50 30 million times apparently not enough

[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:14.840]
For the people who want you on serious if they can't listen live they can listen to the archives. Is Scott well

[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:20.040]
It's just another way to bitch in belly ache and you know complain

When you're gonna go to serious man

No problem in North Miami. Now what does that mean?

[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:43.680]
Too bad it didn't happen yesterday with the great calls that you had I don't know what that means

[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:47.080]
Is that a shot and sounds like a shot in your colors?

[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.840]
Did you have bad calls yesterday it was fine yesterday it was fine

[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:54.880]
That didn't answer my question

[01:36:56.180 --> 01:37:03.020]

I

[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:30.080]
Have to be really really super loyal

[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:35.420]
To listen through all this crap at a boy jolly joebell you are doing it

[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:43.120]
Lewis on the palm coast says question how can you not be heard in daybrowder Palm Beach when I can tune in here in Daytona

[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.040]
As far as I'm concerned keep the signal strong because if you think radio is bad down there

[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:50.300]
Just try listening here terminal. Thanks for the signal said Lewis

[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:53.120]
So we're doing good up there in Daytona all right

[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:57.820]
But that's because the fiddle station isn't getting all the way up off the coast. Well, that's a sad commentary

[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:00.560]
But in mon road date and broward and Palm Beach note out I was like

[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.000]

[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:13.940]
Throwing in and once in a great while

[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:17.060]
One of those

[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.500]
Oh

[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:35.740]

Standing in the bathroom stall. He'll stick his jug right through the wall

[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:44.880]

We know what no show name

[01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:08.880]
Why would someone do this deed to evacuate this seat?

[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:14.140]
Why not meet guy's face to face instead of

[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:17.120]
Such a stingy place

[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:19.920]
We know

[01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:37.880]
If we walk into a public washroom and get the feeling like oh my god, it smells like crap in here

[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:42.140]

Mm-hmm now 319 vote our goal is uh, I don't know 400

[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:14.060]
Pick a low number

[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:16.680]
Especially when they can't hear us. Hello

[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:25.380]
I'm doing everything I can't see we can get through to the audience out there

[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:30.280]
We can't get through to management and we sure as hell can't get through the norm I can't he's busy in court

[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:37.580]
Defending some pervert like me. Hmm. Here's one that says Arnold's real castle is open

They can't send you any food. I'll buy it

[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:52.840]
You'll buy it with money. Wayne wouldn't take your money. I'll slip it in this pocket

[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:55.480]
What about the money that two?

[01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:01.400]
Here's one from gg and it says ps gogators. Oh gee. We got the big game for it tonight

[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:07.740]
VCS championship game. I'm sure everybody's gonna be watching on tv and if you think our daytime signal is bad wow

[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:09.520]
nighttime signal

[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:15.660]
It's like chasing the elusive butterfly. You know, I remember that song by Bob Lynn the elusive butterfly. No

[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:17.980]
You don't might have it, but you got it there

[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:21.780]
Bob Lynn the l.i.n.d no relation to Paul

[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:25.460]
I don't think Bob was gay but nevertheless

[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:30.360]
There it is see not so elusive after all is it no

[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:33.020]
I can't hear her better than our signal

[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:37.400]
Oh nice stereo separation on this you might wake up

[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:40.460]
All the locals run

[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:46.160]
One hit wonder Bob Lynn

[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:56.800]
It was on dot records

[01:41:58.340 --> 01:42:02.820]
Okay, that's it see back when you were a kid and you had all those 45 stacked up

[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:08.820]
And you know what you remember the labels that that's when the actual records would labels

[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:10.720]
You know what a label was on I see

[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:19.120]
No, I only had one you only had one little 45. Yeah, I had album changer you had what albums. I only had one 45

[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:26.180]
And what was that bungalow in the jungle by jethra tall oh my god that after I bought that one

[01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:28.920]
I'd never buy another one. I'll tell you that I that's show it away

[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:33.480]
I like that song anyway this one by gg says hi Neil and George we can hear you loud and clear

[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:38.740]
Minus the chak-chomp music hearing downtown my mood overall the signal blows it blows

[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:40.740]
How do you like that

[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.020]
For an indictment of this company, huh?

[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:47.980]
They're working on it though feverishly they they really are

[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:55.280]
And if we live long enough I think by the time they get it resolved the station to be off the air

[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:59.900]
I could be wrong. Do you notice that we've got an avail in the next break

[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:07.060]
You see that no actually there was a there was a writing so we do oh

[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:13.480]
I just mentioned that just in case anybody from the sale department are connected to it might be listening which I'm sure they're not

[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:16.880]
Races I just don't get it

[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:19.800]
Maybe it's the jock mentality. Maybe they are homophobic

[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:24.440]
Why would somebody with business sense try to piss off the golden goose who puts the station on the map?

[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:29.340]
Who doesn't get any promotion who tries to run out of town at contract time with no respect?

[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:35.940]
Who the who they try to run out of time? I see it proves anyone can run a station without looking oh they're looking all right

[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:38.640]
Oh without looking at the big picture

[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:44.400]
George puts up respectable numbers and your absence and gets the same and people wonder why radio is dying

[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.560]
Well, let me tell you this right. I'm dying of it. Yeah, let me say it again

[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:50.300]
And I have no light one of those two

[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:55.980]
I'm more to charge just relax all of these people are so whipped up. We're doing okay, right?

[01:43:56.540 --> 01:44:01.220]
Yep, I'm not happy about that pay cut. I'm not happy about the sales department and Chris Jones

[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:04.400]
And I'm not talking about the show or making any effort whatsoever to sell it

[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:07.380]
I mean, I mean, you know that that's going to wind up in court all of that stuff

[01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:10.580]
If Norma can't ever get away from all his perverts

[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:14.060]
He won't

[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:16.400]
The least he be spotted in my email or wasn't that something that was something

[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:22.620]
Tom says crummy signal. Thanks for a refreshing thanks for refreshing a childhood memory

[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:28.240]
Remember sitting on a porch on a warm summer's evening and hearing the crickets. That's what your signal sounds like

[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:29.560]
memory says

[01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:30.340]
Nick

[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:34.140]
Well, thanks for rubbing it in Nick

[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:39.320]
Crickets let's get somebody holly cranked up that'll be the day. Come on on brunch with records

[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:41.600]
What are these? I've been with crickets

[01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:44.620]
Yeah, play the crickets and then play a buddy holly

[01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:49.200]
I don't know what ever happened to the crickets were they were they on a plane with buddy. Hi. I don't know

[01:44:57.340 --> 01:44:59.060]
And the big bopper

[01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:01.980]
Runs with records man a purple label dark purple

[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:04.580]
Maybe baby

[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:09.020]
Where's this to go to keep her the keys

[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:12.560]
And who's this can't help that they're talking about

[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:14.280]
Never be the day

[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:20.580]
He was okay was adequate you know

[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:22.840]
Peggy suit

Let me ask you I guess well I already know the answer they can't interfere with the FM's

[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:24.820]
I don't know I guess they're not trying well

[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:29.520]
Well, why the hell would they interfere with like wqba for quite a lot where they put on all that anti-fidel propaganda

[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:34.060]
Allah kubanissima and all those other ones you know maybe they're trying they don't interfere with them, huh?

[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:40.020]
Maybe we're getting to go over I think they're just jealous of that great off in the season man

[01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:43.160]
They're 11 and five season and that horrible playoff game against Baltimore

[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:46.020]

It just never stops. I think I think we're gonna have to like wipe that damn get all your relatives back over here

[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:05.600]
And then we'll just blow the damn thing up

[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:25.800]
Some shahone

[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:30.040]
Maybe next time I'll just wax

[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:35.040]

It's really um, I don't know what to say about them those people

[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:08.120]
So I won't say anything okay, maybe they'll buy some spots on the show sometime not

[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:12.560]
Maybe that bank that I hate like poise maybe they'll buy some spots on the station

[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:16.680]

And then Diffle will come back and have a big powwow with jolly joebell and tell him what a bastard I am

[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:29.140]
And how I chased away nations bank and I would do a hundred years ago because I ripped them on the air

[01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:46.200]
Oh, I guess it's okay right now

[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:48.240]

Here's the NHL network enough

[01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:12.300]
They're brought along slowly enough so that when they hit they're at the right maturation

[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:18.780]
Point that they can oh god. Anybody out there says this show is boring because when you're on my god

[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:23.840]

[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:55.340]
You might tell Steve Sloan go out and sell some more stuff on this show

[01:52:56.860 --> 01:53:00.920]
Hey, I put a pipe bomb under Joe Bell's ass or in it record

[01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:04.560]
It's short list of sales guys. We got selling spots on this show. That's what I'm saying

[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:09.060]
Duff Steve Sloan Bob Eisenberg

[01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:14.940]
Bob Eisenberg ain't selling off on this show. He's selling for you. He's not doing anything on this show

[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:21.080]
He did nothing for me. He did bring he brought those what he bring to the Gulf Stream potatoes or corn

[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:27.240]
Carrots carrots he brought carrots for the horses because PD Lenny. Oh my god

[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:30.980]
PD Lenny's scammed him. He punked him

[01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:37.380]
He skunked him and he told him bring carrots to feed the horses and so he went he stopped at public and bought a whole bunch of carrots

[01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:43.080]
I don't want to see you're an idiot Eisenberg. I shouldn't do that because he's selling the show real big

[01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:44.260]
not

[01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:50.000]
For a few moments about a half an hour ago your signal faded and returned several times

[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:54.860]
I don't know what all these morons are complaining about they were some of the most blissful moments of this entire show

[01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:56.660]
Oh, this is the guy that loves you and hates me

[01:53:56.660 --> 01:54:04.700]
I don't you have some guests on or discuss some topics like a real radio show. Oh boy George discusses things and has people in and takes calls

[01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:10.840]
Hell get pros act around a five-minute spot on the show and I'm sure more people would enjoy that than the other three hours and 55 minutes

[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:15.360]
We have to listen to the Schmidt bat. We have to somebody sitting there with a gun and his head

[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:17.320]
Hold the trigger dammit

[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:22.240]
Why don't you hand it over to George and take out a pad and pencil and take some notes and how to do a radio show

[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:24.500]
George do something I am

[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:32.520]

[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:33.900]

Got a pencil

[01:54:36.340 --> 01:54:37.640]

Do something I am I'm doing something

[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:47.560]
Jeff says sound check and bokeh signals as clear as ever in bokeh. No background noise here

[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:50.280]
You motivated me to switch over and listen to L's soul

[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:54.500]
I suddenly missed the filler and background music too. Love you number one phan

[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:58.120]
How do you like that race is the signals much better

[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:00.600]
Manage been must have been worried about the spots

[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:05.540]
Yeah, I mean as if you're gonna advertise on this radio station if somebody could hear your commercials. I would be good

[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:08.460]
So quit running ten watts during this show

[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:11.400]
Just try to you know they're trying to put the final nails in the coffin

[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:14.280]
So the next book we get like a point oh

[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:20.980]
Here's one from davin abatura says your signal sucks. Where is the engineer did uh

[01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:25.680]
What's his name ever come back Steph? No, and give you a report. No. No, why not?

[01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:27.380]
I don't think he heard anything to report

[01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:31.400]
What does that mean like if he found a problem he would come back and say hey

[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:36.140]
There's a problem blah blah. I think we're gonna do this or we're not gonna do this or blow it out your ass or something

[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:38.840]
Maybe if they cranked the jirbles of if they feed the damn jirbles

[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:41.320]
Maybe we get the damn thing up to about a hundred watts for Christ's

[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:48.540]
It says your signal was going on and off total dead air for quite some time in northeast davin abatura

[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:55.580]
Management must suck cutbacks question mark. Oh, he says not enough hamsters keeping the signal going or they not feeding them

Maybe they like the cedar crews. I like the buddy holly much like it

[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:50.280]
I like buddy holly much better than cedar crews and the interesting thing is they're both dead

[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:33.240]
I thought of all the baby, the baby in truth

[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:38.960]
And how I guess, and she did too

[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:44.100]
Just try to hurt she's legs, she good empty out of roll

[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:48.360]
And create a space between us that could spend

[01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:53.020]
And do the baby, and try to decide

[01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:57.620]
If she farms doesn't matter, when the knees get me

[01:58:58.940 --> 01:59:03.620]
And my eyes start to water, then I think it's about forgiveness

[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:09.580]
To forgiveness, evenness, with every will

[01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:13.500]
Should be explored evermore

[01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:22.700]
There are women in your life, who will get night?

[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:28.420]
That they ever were far, you know they could've done time

[01:59:28.420 --> 01:59:33.520]
But look you in the eye baby, I'll say you wrong

[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:40.200]
Then the rough up those bad sheets, and drop you on home baby

[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:47.220]
I'm trying to decide if she farms doesn't matter, when the back side comes

[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:51.960]
And my friends start to scatter when they get by

[01:59:51.960 --> 02:00:01.360]
To forgiveness, to forgiveness, evenness, evenness, she's exploring

[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:05.540]
Come on baby, you can call again

[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:09.080]
1246-14-01, here's one from your close personal buddy

[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:13.040]
Okay, I'll give you a clue

[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:17.240]
I don't always do this for everybody, but for you I'll give you a clue

[02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:18.400]
All right, let me die

[02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:20.780]
Let me know right down

[02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:25.980]
Okay, says hey wise guy, heard your smart Alec comment about me a few minutes ago

[02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:28.200]
Isn't it amazing that these people are listening religiously?

[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:30.860]
I can't utter a word and then get it by them

[02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:33.080]
All of them, all these naysayers

[02:00:33.900 --> 02:00:35.760]
Why don't you take the stick out of your ass?

[02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:38.780]
I don't care for my boys show, but you are one to talk

[02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:41.200]
You wrote the book, I'm talking about other radio personalities

[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:43.720]
In order to get them to talk about you, you made a career out of it

[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:49.080]
I never ever talked about any radio person to get them to talk about me

[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:52.760]
That is a bald faced, fat assed, horse ball lie

[02:00:54.140 --> 02:00:57.240]
Yeah, talk about all the people of radio TV, you talk about everybody

[02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:59.200]
That's the near Roger show

[02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:05.080]
But in order to get them to talk about me, did I try to get Joey Reynolds to talk about me?

[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:07.220]
Oh God, or Mr. Ego?

[02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:08.640]
No, they just, they're obsessed

[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:11.380]
Like you, Johnny, they're obsessed, obsessed

[02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:12.300]
I have no life

[02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:15.480]
Jesus, God, get out some of those old flannel checkered shirts

[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:18.480]
And go have a good time at Duda's before it's too late

[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:21.840]
Now, is he working somewhere, Johnny, Dork or what?

[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:22.300]
I don't know

[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:25.220]
Well, you seem to be really kind of him

[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:26.680]
No, I don't

[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:28.340]
You invite him in for that once that one day

[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:29.000]
Yeah, that's right

[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.080]
You said to me, boy, don't ever bring that turret back in here

[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:31.800]
That's what I said

[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:36.520]
Rocky says, can't us must macho buddy Holly or Celia Cruz

[02:01:38.540 --> 02:01:40.320]
Do you think it makes a difference now?

[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:40.860]
No

[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:42.580]
Probably not

[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:46.960]
Just like that guy that took that early in the show that was talking about David Bloom

[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:48.200]
Why would he put him on the list?

[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:49.840]
He's dead

[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:55.440]
Anyway, here's one from TR, who's obviously very confused

[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:59.560]
Because I never lived in Miami shores or anywhere near Miami shores, but nevertheless

[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:00.440]
I don't think

[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:02.160]
Did I live in Miami shores?

[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:02.780]
I don't know

[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:03.520]
No

[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:04.540]
No

[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:08.820]
It says nation's bank changed its name to Bank of America after the merger with Bank of America

[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:12.160]
However, nation's bank was the acquiring party

[02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:18.040]
All the senior management including the CEOs were the nation's bank management team

[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:22.160]
PS during my training at nation's bank in 1993 for management

[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:24.960]
I was one of your account managers at the Miami shores location

[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:29.660]
Loved you then and now that I'm getting old still do since TR

[02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:31.180]
Well, thanks TR, but I don't know what that means

[02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:35.720]
He was one of my account managers at the Miami shores location, he or she

[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:36.360]
That's what he says

[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:42.880]
But I never I never was ad banked in Miami shores because I never lived anywhere near there especially in 1993

[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:43.620]
Well, maybe you forgot

[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:45.240]
No

[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:50.300]
But maybe these two like you know, posky around with my money, that could be it

[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:56.220]
Like the current bank that I'm with, which used to be nation's bank which we used to be family bank which used to be

[02:02:56.220 --> 02:02:57.720]
Well, I don't want to say what it is now

[02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:03.300]
Jimmy says I'm in pomp and oh and your show is coming through just fine. Oh wait

[02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:05.880]
You're not listening to the salsa music in the background never mind

[02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:09.780]
At least you're not talking about wrestling and taking calls from washed up wrestlers

[02:03:09.780 --> 02:03:13.380]
Take care of Neil PS, tell Georgia's daughter. I'll give her a ride

[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:15.260]
Ah, haha

[02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:19.140]
Over Georgia's dead body with a Jimmy said to take her she can take care of herself

[02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:22.160]
Yeah, that's right or here's me

[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:24.440]
Mary

[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:28.000]
Mary of B.O.T.

[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:28.660]
Oh, not cute

[02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:31.100]
Everything with this guy's bitch and B.O.T.

[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:31.440]
Okay

[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:38.100]
You say that nobody will try to sell your show to do everything you need to show to sell first satellite radio is going out so

[02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:39.780]
Maybe you should go there and just fade away

[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:41.960]
Fade away

[02:03:43.300 --> 02:03:45.940]
Kind of like sound like Johnny Dork same crap, you know

[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:49.740]
Who are you going to be talking about blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah? I

[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:54.260]
Talk about whatever you want to talk about including your stupid fat ass Johnny

[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:59.780]
It's time to win Israel's Gaza war that's the editorial in yesterday's Toronto star

[02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:06.200]
Now do you think I dare to read all these stories about piled up here that time?

[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:14.040]
I could take some calls what do you mean a couple I got one two three four

[02:04:15.140 --> 02:04:16.400]
Oh wait a minute here's some emails

[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:24.200]

Loaded and I got my cooler full of ice this is from this information news

[02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:45.980]
2009 maybe underway, but it's your 2012 that's got everybody talking I don't have anybody talking about do you sure all the time?

[02:04:46.180 --> 02:04:47.940]
documentary and stuff books

[02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:57.140]
People people like in shopping malls like it when you come to my house they talked about 2012. Mm-hmm. They are yep

[02:04:57.140 --> 02:05:04.820]
And all week long on television the history channel is alerting its viewers and many others who see you big what it says play

[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:09.800]
Placid on bus shoulders and telephone booths the world they come to an end of the 721st 2012

[02:05:11.140 --> 02:05:16.180]
It's like why 2k, baby. Remember all the history with why 2k? Oh, I love it

[02:05:16.940 --> 02:05:22.640]
Power's gonna go out the water's gonna stop running your Colossary bags gonna overflow and over these the empty for you

[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:26.620]
Oh my god

[02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:29.520]
Hulk Hogan's gonna walk off the bubble loves fun show

[02:05:34.940 --> 02:05:41.300]
Computers go off high that's right all computers are going offline the world was gonna come to an end as we knew it a

[02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:47.460]
Two-hour special kicking off histories Armageddon week claims that the 16th century Suisse or no Stardomis

[02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:54.940]
Ward of Apocalypse in 2012 and if that's not enough then try the Egyptians the free Masons and yes the ancient civilization

[02:05:54.940 --> 02:05:59.900]
It actually didn't have something to say about 2012 the Maya in southern Mexico and northern Central America

[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:07.220]
Throughout we hear ominous music and dynamic dramatic narration warning of global apocalypse. Oh my god

[02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:14.240]
This follows a holiday movie schedule and which it was hard to avoid dramatic teaser ads for row and emeryx

[02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:21.980]
Summer 2009 ends times disaster movie 2012. Oh, this is just a hype for another movie, right? I guess

[02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:29.700]
Counter-balancing this apocalypse the hype comes 2012 science and superstition a new documentary film from the

[02:06:29.900 --> 02:06:30.460]
disinformation

[02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:37.280]
News and network where they've launched exclusively on Apple I tune the store and is already on the best selling documentaries chart

[02:06:39.380 --> 02:06:46.680]
That goes on on as Hollywood in the mainstream media distorting exploiting my encounter in their constant quest for ratings and box office

[02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:54.120]
Access more and more people looking for information on what 2012 really means. Oh, God. I'm gonna worry about this all afternoon

[02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:54.660]
I would buy

[02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:02.440]
2012 it's only like three years away all the way. What is it December? Well, it's almost four years away

[02:07:02.900 --> 02:07:05.880]
I'll be dead by that anyway. That's what Johnny's praying for

[02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:11.280]
He's probably got his near Rogers voodoo doll right now talk about sticking to put a stick up your ass. That's what he's doing

[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:14.100]
He's sticking a pin in my back. Oh geez

[02:07:16.940 --> 02:07:22.060]
Keith says they should send all the Palestinians to W.I.O.D. Then they'll know what misery really is

[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:24.960]
What does that mean? I don't know

[02:07:25.740 --> 02:07:34.780]
Send all the Palestinians to W.I.O.D. Well, I think I think he may have a point W.I.O.D. Oh, I hate that station. Doodah doodah

[02:07:36.540 --> 02:07:40.840]
Okay, so here's what the Toronto Star says do I have time for this before the break probably not

[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:44.280]
Probably not so let's take a few kids a pool

[02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:46.860]
See how we're doing on there

[02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:54.140]
384 so I think we're gonna make that 400 not like overwhelming not like that a wait a minute here's Cliff

[02:07:55.500 --> 02:07:55.900]
I

[02:07:55.900 --> 02:07:59.080]
Grandpa and barefoot Bay went home to be with the Lord to his day night

[02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:04.920]
Last month got to be too much to handle for the family so we had to put him in an assisted dying facility

[02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:10.300]
It was a single family home with five bedrooms of the dying elderly even the front lawn was dying

[02:08:10.940 --> 02:08:16.200]
Says Cliff and Kendall when I made my final visit I was greeted by two sweaty and nervous Bohemian nurses

[02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:22.640]
Poor grandpa probably had a heart attack when he woke up and found a black person in his room life goes on you'll see

[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:24.620]
Cliff and Kendall how do you like that and

[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:28.920]
Assisted dying facility. You know there was such a place. They're called hospices

[02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:34.740]
Yeah, but I never heard of it called an assisted dying facility either that sounds like so finally, you know like

[02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:40.900]
So does I like I'm dying over here. What so does hospice no hospice sounds like I don't know

[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:43.360]
Like kind of a nasty hospital

[02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:45.620]
Although they all are they all are

[02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:49.920]
You go to hospital man if you come out alive. It's a miracle. I don't care. Which one we're talking about

[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:52.220]
They're all it's just a matter of degrees

[02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:54.240]
They're butcher houses

[02:08:55.520 --> 02:09:01.960]
383 on the survey of the needle which QA M showed he listened to the most I only listened to the 186 48 and a half percent

[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:06.080]
I'm sure Johnny dork falls into that category. He's listening right now

[02:09:06.980 --> 02:09:12.100]
I'm taking the stick out of my ass right now. I'm gonna smear it right under your nose Johnny right where their mustache is

[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:15.080]
Didn't he had any half a mustache? Yes

[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:22.920]
I remember I just remember he was big and annoying all right. Well imagine an idea. He was all right on your shape body

[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:26.200]
He just takes it also personal just an radio show Johnny

It's a 101 you know what I got to do sometime maybe this weekend. I'm going to Taco Bell

[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:10.900]
Okay, I keep threatening to do that and I just never get around with these one like not that far from me

[02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:13.680]
Okay, and why don't I go there? I love it and

[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:20.560]
Then you see the response you always go when you mention Taco Bell. Well, that's not real Mexican food. So who cares?

[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:21.300]
Good

[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:26.880]
Yeah, exactly I'm afraid of whatever real Mexican food. Oh, I had some

[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:31.200]
Oh, yeah, oh did you know oh when it tells about it?

[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:35.500]
It was a beef with sliced carrots and mung and

[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:42.820]
And then of course there's always like a there's always a side dish with sour cream

[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:48.580]
Okay, and guacamole okay, even if even if you're eating like ice cream, you know, there's a side dish

[02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:52.600]
All right, sour cream and guacamole which I hate guacamole. I say I like sour cream

[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:55.960]
Mm-hmm, and I smeared some of that in that and what it's still didn't help

[02:11:57.820 --> 02:12:03.280]
Here's one about banking which I'll read the first part of it last part is obviously an attempt to a sucker me to talking about a particular

[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:05.800]
Bank which I'm not gonna do and it's full of crap

[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:11.200]
I've which were on thousands of dollars in cash at a time for my bank with my ATM card without any problem at all

[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:15.420]
There are so many great banks competing in Miami. Why would you stick with a bad one?

[02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:21.080]
There were even banks that now open seven days a week and I promised next day availability of funds from deposited checks

[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:21.720]
Well good

[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:26.860]
Coming with some of the mar which certainly is not the one that you say in the next paragraph after that

[02:12:26.860 --> 02:12:31.380]
But nevertheless so Johnny dark who's listening like I said hanging on every word

[02:12:31.380 --> 02:12:34.780]
Well, he's got a lot of time on his hands, you know, he says get it right

[02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:41.240]
Roundup is the new hangout because I was saying do does round up. You know we're round up his no probably in Davy

[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:46.700]
Okay, well Johnny said Davy kind of a guy, you know, so I heard then he says I've had some offers

[02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:50.420]
But I'm enjoying the downtime got a call a few weeks back from Fleetwood Groover

[02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:51.900]
Who's now a W M M O and Orlando?

[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:56.520]
What is W M M O what is that don't know?

[02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:04.160]
Is that Schmidt kick in music don't know remember Fleetwood Groover? I do I just a call him Fleetwood Mac Groover Groovy name

[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:08.720]
Yeah, yeah, I'm what was he on was he on the coast? He was the PD of the coast that's correct

[02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:14.440]
And then he went off to Washington DC. I do believe I don't know and then there was some story about some chick that was working

[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:17.260]
I would be in the PD at some station in Washington

[02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:20.420]
Was the daddy of her baby or something like that remember that?

[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:24.340]
That wasn't Fleetwood Groover was oh

[02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:30.340]
And now why you go mm-hmm like cuz you don't want to get a mouthful of food there. Yeah, right. You're full of crap

[02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:32.020]
That's what you got crap

[02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:34.980]
You are such a melee mouth. Mm-hmm

[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:38.340]
Won't think to be a nile. It's nothing to be a melee mouth

[02:13:39.820 --> 02:13:43.940]
398 on a pole we're gonna make 400 nice going without without fact Chris. How do you like that?

[02:13:46.260 --> 02:13:48.240]
Jason in plantation says

[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:54.180]
Bank of America have been with the same SOB vaccines the NC and V days the best

[02:13:56.360 --> 02:13:59.160]
Says Jason in plantation with Kawasaki disease

[02:14:00.740 --> 02:14:03.640]
Now is there really such a thing as Kawasaki disease?

[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:06.120]
Yeah, as a matter of fact, we were talking about it yesterday

[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:09.340]
Lee look sharp and was reading off of Wikipedia. It's not

[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:15.140]
Necessarily a real thing. It's another one of those things where maybe it's real. Maybe it's not is real

[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:18.200]
Yeah

[02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:19.860]
Well, what is that?

[02:14:19.940 --> 02:14:25.960]
This whole thing like his big excuses that the kid was exposed to carpet cleaner because he used to be a neat freak

[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:30.180]
So they used to have the carpets cleaned and shampooed like every day every day

[02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:32.420]
Because the Scientologists don't believe in that

[02:14:32.420 --> 02:14:36.700]
And they changed their tune now. They don't acknowledge or deny the existence of

[02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:40.480]
I see that's their public position on the matter, which of course is a big fat line

[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:47.040]
But you lunatics okay closet queens you fairy John revolta and Tommy Cruz you fairy all these other idiots

[02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:54.240]
Toronto star yesterday said it's time to end Israel's Gaza war when even the United Nations compounds in Gaza full of covering

[02:14:54.240 --> 02:15:00.180]
Refugee families are no longer safe havens the time has come to wind down Israel's 12-day military drive to shatter

[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:01.380]
Hamas's fighting ability

[02:15:01.900 --> 02:15:07.580]
That much would be obvious to Israeli Prime Minister Olmert following an Israeli mortar attack yesterday at UN school

[02:15:07.580 --> 02:15:09.940]
They killed more than 30 including several children

[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:14.540]
In a cruel irony the military had urged families to flee their homes for safer locales

[02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:19.580]
But Hamas fighters using civilians at the school as shields attacked Israeli troops with mortars

[02:15:19.580 --> 02:15:25.040]
Provoking a counter barrage at another UN school and Israeli strike kill three

[02:15:25.820 --> 02:15:31.120]
While Israel has no option but to defend itself against rocket attacks that have reached halfway to tell of even the main airport

[02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:36.680]
Olmert must know that if his deterrent message hasn't gone through to Hamas's united leadership by now it never will

[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:42.980]
The military has killed Hamas leader Nizar Raiyan and 130 other militants and it shattered the Hamas's infrastructure

[02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:46.100]
driven militants underground destroyed weapons and disrupted rockets

[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:53.040]
But short of reoccupying Gaza Olmert can hope to prevent a resumption of the rocket attacks only by striking a truce with Hamas

[02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:55.940]
Which is too deeply rooted to be defeated politically at least

[02:15:56.820 --> 02:16:02.240]
Indeed Israelis anticipate a ceasefire or truce yesterday a scramble was on at the UN and across the region to shape the

[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:05.320]
Generally agreed contours and into Hamas's attacks

[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:10.300]
Assurances that Hamas won't rearm credible monitoring and a lifting of Israel's economic siege

[02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:16.240]
Certainly Israel's long-term security will be better served by ending the war before it's a verse prospects for a broader peace

[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:21.500]
Olmert has made his point one more can be gained by prolonging the conflict and Israeli ceasefire will give

[02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:28.100]
Egypt and Turkey leverage in their vetted raw Syria away from its ties with the ran and to force Hamas Syria's client to accept the truce

[02:16:29.140 --> 02:16:35.360]
This is a message Prime Minister Steven Harper should deliver Harper silence does nothing good for Canada's image as US president

[02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:40.180]
Like Barack Obama voices deep concern for civilians and other world leaders try to broker a ceasefire

[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:44.520]
Sadly Palestinians and Israelis are being betrayed by an absence of leadership

[02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:47.700]
Neither side has been willing to make the compromises required for peace

[02:16:48.260 --> 02:16:55.520]
That boosted Hamas's appeal with tragic results by yesterday some 600 gossens were dead over three thousand injured and 10 Israelis were killed

[02:16:56.620 --> 02:17:01.860]
Mosques homes and public offices were in ruins a crisis is building its fuel water medical supplies were insured

[02:17:01.860 --> 02:17:05.380]
And the tragedies that the UN sides confirmed there are no safe havens

[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:10.860]
This undermines Palestinian President Abbas even though one of Israel's aims is to help him by weakening his foe Hamas

[02:17:10.860 --> 02:17:15.620]
It is radicalized the West Bank and arrest making Hamas look heroic battling superior forces

[02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:21.900]
All without contributing much to Israel's long-term security. It's time to wind up this war says the Toronto star

[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:29.660]
Oh, and then that email I got earlier giving me instructions about what to say in Yadeh and we haven't caught up yet with all the Jews that have been killed

[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:34.220]
How many million Palestinians are there?

[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:38.800]
I don't think there are that many and not only that but if that's if that's the goal

[02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:42.140]
If that's the end game then why not go into Germany why not nuke Germany?

[02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:46.100]
There used to be 10 there is three and a half now left to three and a half million left in Palestine. Yes

[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:49.340]
Palestine. Did you say won't what used to be

[02:17:51.140 --> 02:17:55.260]
You're staring to sound pretty anti-Semitic. That guy's gonna start protesting front of your ass

[02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:58.800]
He's gonna start demonstrating in front of your butt

[02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:06.660]
Are you an official in the Gaza strip say Israeli forces have fired on a truck out of you in aid mission and killed a driver

[02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:08.440]
on an aid mission

[02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:14.040]
Oh, tell me I'm gonna revert to that in the one to do that around this time. Yeah

[02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:23.160]
You and spokesman Adnan Abu Haznah says the incident for place during a law declared by Israel to allow humanitarian aid to enter the territory

[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:28.980]
He says he went coordinated delivery with Israel and the vehicle was marked with the UN flag and insignia when it was shot in northern Gaza

[02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:34.500]
The Israeli army says it's investigating we're looking to it. Oh, yeah, look you better look

[02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:40.100]
406 votes on our survey and somebody says oh

[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:49.800]
My god, it says Taco Bell's meat is USDA grade double E acceptable. How can you eat that with my mouth?

[02:18:51.500 --> 02:18:55.880]
I don't eat Taco Bell. I mean I thought I go there that often, but I've been eating it for years. I'm still alive

[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:03.420]
What does that mean double E acceptable? That's the lowest grade of beef that can be legally sold to humans. Yeah

[02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:05.260]
And

[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:07.040]
That's it you asked

[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:15.160]
So what's wrong with it? Don't you like Taco Bell? Have you have you eaten there once a week more life? Are you still alive? I so far. Let me I think so

[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:24.760]
How can you possibly that with my mouth? I like it. Oh, there's another instruction say oh don't do this and don't do that you're wrong

[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:25.840]
You know

[02:19:27.180 --> 02:19:30.460]
Not something to actually say about anything meaningful

[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:34.920]
But don't do this and don't do that critiques

[02:19:35.380 --> 02:19:40.300]
Uh, what's the other lanes complaints and plates and life instruction. That's part of critiques

[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:46.920]
Life instruction quit smoking at nasty weed. It'll uh, what would the other one say? Oh, it lowers your immune system

[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:52.040]
Loers your immune system makes you weak. That's why Georgia sick all the time because he smokes too much of that whiskey

[02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:52.960]
It's a back you

[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:56.400]
Provert by didn't let me sick all the time

[02:19:58.100 --> 02:19:59.660]
2012 we're all gonna die

[02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:03.080]
Well, let's see how many years I got we got five oh oh

[02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:08.420]
Better better push it back till 2014 so I can collect every dime from these bastards

I'm gonna collect every single dime every peso

[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:23.220]
From these bastards from these life destroyers that that's what this business does best case you haven't noticed

[02:20:23.220 --> 02:20:25.960]
I know destroys lives

[02:20:27.200 --> 02:20:29.200]
Wdl we destroy life

[02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:33.940]

[02:20:33.940 --> 02:20:39.620]
No way they killed this year!

[02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:44.240]
Bro, hockey's gone!

[02:20:45.640 --> 02:20:49.180]
A hoser's greatest fear!

[02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:55.320]
No avalanche, no faithful leaves,

[02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:59.420]
No red wings and no stars!

[02:20:59.420 --> 02:21:00.500]
Your fairies!

[02:21:00.780 --> 02:21:09.400]
The only fights in Canada will be inside the forest!

[02:21:10.420 --> 02:21:14.240]
I got this cage!

No can it all basketball's not for us!

[02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:39.060]
No can it all basketball is not for us!

[02:21:41.400 --> 02:21:44.740]
Hey, one sixteen at five sixty W.D. Q.A.

[02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:46.320]
I'm not that bad, a little bit of sun there,

[02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:48.340]
and snow is melting away.

[02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:51.020]
How about this summer time in a week or two?

[02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:51.940]
Not here.

[02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:56.720]
Sean says this is a pole, Sean from Hollywood, our club buddy.

[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:00.880]
Oh, look at this!

[02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:02.020]
Look at that!

[02:22:02.100 --> 02:22:03.740]
Sean, yeah, look at this!

[02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:05.100]
He's got a PS.

[02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:08.400]
He says, by the way, Charlie B sends this pole,

[02:22:08.580 --> 02:22:10.780]
who sports the nicest cod piece?

[02:22:12.260 --> 02:22:13.780]
Ian Anderson of Jess Rotel,

[02:22:13.780 --> 02:22:15.660]
Larry Blackman of Cameo,

[02:22:15.940 --> 02:22:18.360]
Gold member, Alex in the Clockwork Orange,

[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:20.220]
Gene Simmons of Kiss or Romeo.

[02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:23.280]
All right?

[02:22:24.740 --> 02:22:26.260]
Just a little shot at Charlie B.

[02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:29.660]
What are you trying to say, Charlie B is like that or what?

[02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:30.240]
I don't know.

[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:30.880]
I'm trying to say, Sean,

[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:34.720]
anyway, Sean says I just wanted to compliment your friends at Gulfstream.

[02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:38.780]
I just went back from Wheel of Fortune all the money I'd lost on the West Coast tracks,

[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.540]
so I was strolling through the parking lot when they were of contempt

[02:22:41.540 --> 02:22:45.220]
and when I came upon an old Hispanic guy on his hands and easing in some distress.

[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:48.740]
As I was the first person to pass him who did not ignore him,

[02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:50.400]
I helped him up and asked him if he was okay.

[02:22:51.260 --> 02:22:53.920]
Even with my gringo ear, I was able to understand he had fallen,

[02:22:54.060 --> 02:22:56.160]
could not get up, was separated from his family,

[02:22:56.680 --> 02:22:57.800]
confused and by his breath,

[02:22:58.160 --> 02:22:59.420]
more than little...

[02:22:59.800 --> 02:23:00.160]
...mithfaced.

[02:23:01.540 --> 02:23:04.080]
I helped him to the main entrance in the fashion football players

[02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:05.360]
are assisted in the sidelines,

[02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:06.820]
and when I summoned help.

[02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:09.800]
A young security guard in Hellendale,

[02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:11.620]
a patrolman on duty there, tracked down his family,

[02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:16.460]
whilst I attempted to console the weeping altar boy and my Portuguese-lay Spanish.

[02:23:18.220 --> 02:23:19.940]
He was quickly reunited with his family,

[02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:21.120]
who appeared to be a little put out there,

[02:23:21.120 --> 02:23:22.560]
were summoned away from the Latin festival,

[02:23:22.820 --> 02:23:23.960]
and he was on his way home.

[02:23:24.860 --> 02:23:27.020]
The folks at Gulfstream could have been nicer about the whole thing,

[02:23:27.460 --> 02:23:28.280]
sorry to be so uplifting,

[02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:31.200]
I promise so much more hostile and negative story next time, says Sean.

[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:34.160]
Thanks for the good news, Sean, they are nice people at Gulfstream.

[02:23:35.540 --> 02:23:38.700]
And we're doing a dry run on that to pick up onything tomorrow, right?

[02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:39.000]
That's right.

[02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:42.540]
So that means we'll be carrying the second race,

[02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:44.780]
so I got a handicap that race tonight?

[02:23:45.580 --> 02:23:48.340]
I'm a good moody Bruce, has the 83 parts of a link.

[02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:50.600]
Native matches there toward the well.

[02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:53.200]
Florida's QT is up from between horses.

[02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:55.360]
Line euro makes it three in a line on the outside.

[02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:58.520]
I think like somebody is goosing him during these race calls, this guy in Tampa.

[02:23:58.620 --> 02:24:01.100]
To pick it up, they're not still along my back.

[02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:04.840]
To King Glocken on the outside, Centeno angles him to the outside

[02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:08.220]
and now asking for run as a quarter of a mile still to run.

[02:24:08.220 --> 02:24:12.760]
Moody Bruce has the lead Florida's QT on the outside, second on America.

[02:24:13.460 --> 02:24:16.520]
Moves up from the far outside, now to be third three links further back.

[02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:17.080]
King Glocken.

[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:19.600]
Yeah, but what does it have to do with Hulk Hogan for Christ's sakes, right?

[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:20.700]
Who?

[02:24:21.300 --> 02:24:22.080]
Hulk Hogan.

[02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:22.880]
What about him?

[02:24:24.060 --> 02:24:25.520]
And what does it got to do with hockey?

[02:24:27.220 --> 02:24:29.100]
There's a shot right on power.

[02:24:29.220 --> 02:24:29.820]
He's the same.

[02:24:29.980 --> 02:24:30.720]
It covers up.

[02:24:30.980 --> 02:24:32.880]
I'm falling in front of that shot.

[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:35.960]
There we go, leasing Canadians from a hundred years ago, man.

[02:24:35.980 --> 02:24:37.020]
It's called living in the past.

[02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:38.340]
There's nothing like living in the past.

[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:41.520]
That's why the past always seems so much better, because you can be selective.

[02:24:41.740 --> 02:24:43.980]
You know, the present, it is what it is.

[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:49.160]
You can't select picking shoes and say, well, you know, this part of the day was great.

[02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:50.000]
The rest of the day suck.

[02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:51.480]
It is what it is, right?

[02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:56.140]
But in the past, you can look back and say, oh, man, remember, all those great restaurants

[02:24:56.140 --> 02:24:59.580]
and remember this and remember the great sports and whatever.

[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:02.220]
The great ass.

[02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:08.600]
Jank Yuger on the smirking chimps says, what was Israel supposed to do?

[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:09.260]
Question mark?

[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:14.220]
I sure hope I don't start choking and gagging again.

[02:25:14.220 --> 02:25:15.020]
Sorry, that would be bad.

[02:25:15.180 --> 02:25:16.300]
Then you'd probably have to work tomorrow.

[02:25:16.740 --> 02:25:17.620]
And that guy'd be real happy.

[02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:18.680]
George might be out tomorrow.

[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:26.140]
The government of Israel keeps saying their actions are justifiable because they're doing it in retaliation for what Hamas has done.

[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:28.500]
Hamas is the same exact thing.

[02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:33.500]
They're firing the rockets in retaliation for what Israel did in imposing a blockade and bombing their tunnels and leaders.

[02:25:33.660 --> 02:25:37.640]
I find both points completely unpersuasive, yes, including Israel's.

[02:25:39.140 --> 02:25:42.160]
Every day now, I hear someone saying, what was Israel supposed to do?

[02:25:42.460 --> 02:25:44.200]
Hamas keeps firing rockets into their country.

[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:46.840]
So here's a quick list of things they were supposed to do.

[02:25:47.420 --> 02:25:49.600]
One, not break the cease fire in the first place.

[02:25:50.420 --> 02:25:55.820]
Yes, I understand their frustration with the tunnels, which are used not only in the smog of food, medicine, and goods, but also the smog of weapons.

[02:25:55.820 --> 02:25:59.340]
But those weapons were not being used until Israel started bombing the tunnels.

[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:04.120]
What were they supposed to do? Wait until the weapons were used? Yes, that's the point of a cease fire.

[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:07.520]
I know Israel would not like any of their enemies to have any weapons.

[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:09.180]
From their perspective, that makes sense.

[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:14.100]
But Israel doesn't need tunnels for weapons. The US just gives them to them and their weapons are a thousand times bigger.

[02:26:14.740 --> 02:26:18.840]
So yes, you did not bomb just because the other side might acquire one percent of the weapons you have.

[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:25.100]
Otherwise, you'll always be bombing because it's logical for the other side to try to require those weapons for what they perceive to be self-defense.

[02:26:25.900 --> 02:26:34.240]
If you're threshold for starting violence is that the other side is thinking about it, close to the rationale we used in Iraq, then you'll always be starting wars, self-defense my ass.

[02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:40.000]
Those are called first strikes. If you think it's necessary, fine, but don't pretend that you didn't start the hostilities.

[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:42.820]
Two, you're stronger, don't strike back.

[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:47.000]
I know people will say that's crazy. You have to retaliate. Otherwise, you'll show weakness.

[02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:53.200]
Again, that's exactly what Hamas says to their fellow Palestinians. We have to strike back. We can't let the Israelis push us around anymore.

[02:26:53.840 --> 02:27:00.120]
And what do we tell them to choose nonviolence instead? I must have said a million times in reference to Hamas and the Palestinians.

[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:07.120]
So what can I say the same thing to Israel? Why are the Palestinians the only ones who must choose nonviolence? Shouldn't Israel also choose nonviolence?

[02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:15.300]
In fact, a strong have a responsibility to be better than that. They can lead the way toward peace because they know if it comes down to all out war, they can destroy the other side.

[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:22.980]
Sometimes an older brother doesn't hit back at his younger brother because he knows he can cause more damage than the little guy. That's being smart, responsible, and decent.

[02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:27.920]
Hitting UN's school and killing 30 civilians, mostly children, is not being any of those things.

[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:35.920]
Three, make a peace deal already. Here's the standard response to this. We're ready to make a peace deal, but the Palestinians will agree.

[02:27:36.420 --> 02:27:44.400]
Arafat walked away from a deal in 2000. They don't want peace. That's horse crap. In negotiations, people accept certain deals and won't accept others. That's completely normal.

[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:52.400]
Ahood Barack also walked away from that deal because he had an election coming up beginning of 2001. That's also normal. If people don't like deals enough, they walk away from them.

[02:27:53.020 --> 02:28:00.980]
The biggest dispute was over what percentage of the West Bank Israel would keep. That's a perfectly fair dispute. Either side could have given in and taken a lower percentage. Neither side did.

[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:08.000]
Could Israel have had a deal if they gave up all of the West Bank split Jerusalem and gave the right to return for Palestinian refugees? Absolutely.

[02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:14.780]
I mean, absolutely. Every single negotiator involved in the process will tell you the Palestinians would have taken that deal in a second.

[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:22.320]
Now if I was Israel, would I take that deal? No, but that's my point. Both sides could have a deal instantly if they gave up a little bit more than they are willing.

[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:30.960]
So to pretend that only the Palestinians are unwilling to negotiate is silly. Right now Israel says they can't negotiate with Hamas because Hamas won't recognize Israel's right to exist.

[02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:39.640]
Hamas says Israel will not recognize their right to exist, which is true. In fact, Israel just started an invasion to eradicate Hamas. Both sides are ridiculously obstinate.

[02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:50.460]
Again, it's incumbent upon the strong to bend a little, especially if they claim they really, really want peace. But even if you don't want to bend during the negotiations, you want to keep a slightly higher percentage of the West Bank.

[02:28:50.460 --> 02:28:58.580]
Please don't pretend you didn't have a choice. Finally, let me ask you this personal question to give you a sense of what people mean when they say Israel is acting disproportionately.

[02:28:59.620 --> 02:29:07.920]
Let's say you're walking down the street in your local county here gunfire. You have a vague suspicion that someone is firing at you from a nearby school. Would you fire bomb the school just in case?

[02:29:08.860 --> 02:29:15.300]
You know what the answer to that question is if you're a decent human being, no way. You might be scared out of your mind. You might be afraid for your life.

[02:29:15.300 --> 02:29:20.900]
But you're not going to throw a bomb into a school full of children just in case, especially when you're not even sure that's where the shots are coming from.

[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:33.220]
You would be called a psychopath if you did. But today we hear excuses like, hey, that's what happens in wars. Maybe that's why it's incumbent upon us to try a little harder to avoid wars so that we don't act all like psychopaths when they start.

[02:29:34.140 --> 02:29:46.540]
Thank you. He's good. You want to see his junk, oh, no, thank you. No, I'm good. Are you good? Great. How's that car coming by the way you got that one? Even a note.

[02:29:47.720 --> 02:30:05.800]
Trick down escalate. I can just see you in an escalate talking about a pim. Yeah, yeah. The target is a pim. I should have known it was by Zini all along. That's a great scene in a car. You know, after they have the meetings of the five families.

[02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:23.360]
And Tom Hagen is like shocked. Shocked. Oh, that's great. My paycheck came today. I just got to report from down there. Thanks a lot, jolly. Joe. Don't forget. Half a show is better than none.

[02:30:25.260 --> 02:30:32.460]
Here's a couple about let's see. Uncle Neal dog food is grade D. So that mean that W is lower than dog food.

[02:30:32.460 --> 02:30:49.180]
I guess so. Well, like is it like shoe size? I don't know Jason from plantation says I worked for a freight company that would ship and deliver a sawdust slash slash cat litter looking product to all Taco Bell locations.

[02:30:49.800 --> 02:30:58.280]
The boxes were labeled ground beef filler. Don't eat that. Smith says Jason. How do you like that? Wow. Cat cat food.

[02:31:01.980 --> 02:31:16.480]
Catnip. You know what? I like it just fine. No, you're going to die. Too bad. In fact, you know something I'm going to this weekend just out of spite. There's just approved you. I'll be back on Monday. If I'm out here Monday, you'll know I died from Taco Bell. Okay.

[02:31:18.240 --> 02:31:26.400]
Do you know anybody who doesn't love Taco Bell? No vegetarians. Oh, why they don't have like stuff.

[02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:42.340]
Taco's whether you could look at like cheese and stuff. I don't know without that. Vegetarian options they have. I guess you could order a burrito with no meat. There you go. And certainly with no beans. Oh, hold the beans. Please. That's the only thing I don't like is those mushy beans.

[02:31:43.460 --> 02:31:58.480]
What is that all about? Is it because it's cheap? It's like the Chinese and rice. A lot of people like those mushy beans. No, no, but I'm just saying that isn't that one of the reasons that the certain groups eat a lot of beans like Mexicans, for example. A lot of people like beans.

[02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:10.800]
Mooshy beans. Yeah, I thought we discussed earlier. We don't like mushy man. I don't. Some people do. Oh, break it. You should avoid. You can.

[02:32:10.980 --> 02:32:21.760]
Zero. So what I forgot to do is you have.

[02:32:24.360 --> 02:32:39.420]
It is one way to get attention. It's like driving down the street and have people not gesturing with all five fingers. That's what happens in free society for people to try to draw attention to themselves.

[02:32:41.640 --> 02:32:51.100]
It's a way for people to draw attention. I don't know what the guys cause is, but one thing is for certain. I didn't feel the least that threatened by it.

[02:32:59.840 --> 02:33:04.860]
132 at 560 WQM I shouldn't be reading these articles that are even the slightest.

[02:33:04.880 --> 02:33:15.760]
Oh boy, we're going to get picked up. Here is no. This is a different one. Oh, short. It says subject week. You're understanding of the Israel Palestine situation is clearly at a very superficial level.

[02:33:15.760 --> 02:33:29.180]
Interesting that you have such a strong opinion on something you know so little about. Okay, that's settled. Yeah. And so is every other country in the world other than the USA. Every other country in the world got the same opinion about what Israel is doing, but nevertheless.

[02:33:30.360 --> 02:33:45.360]
And virtually every credible journalist like Robert here who I've got his comment. Second, although the gravity guy points out. He says it's funny. You mentioned Elvis in the context of the Cuban radio stations barging in on QM frequency because Cuban radio actually plays.

[02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:54.300]
Elvis on their radio program stations, they transmit the same station and multiple frequencies effort entire programs of nothing but Elvis songs.

[02:33:55.940 --> 02:34:08.380]
Of course is in most of the world. Elvis made an enormous impact on Cuban youth. He inspired many young guys to emulate him besides those four lads from Liverpool and Cubans were no exception among them. Perhaps the most prominent was Luis Luisito Bravo.

[02:34:08.380 --> 02:34:28.020]
Oh, did I tell you about my the Christmas party? Did you? You're just watching Christmas party. Yeah, I don't know. That was that was a different. That was a dinner. Oh, I don't think this was also a dinner. And we walked into these people's homes and there was music playing on the computer. Okay. Guess who was singing Luis Miguel. Yes.

[02:34:28.020 --> 02:34:38.980]
And being one of the very, very few people in the room speaking any English at all. I said, wow, that's Luis Miguel. Oh, my God. The host of this event was like, Oh, hey.

[02:34:40.500 --> 02:34:44.760]
Because he claimed to be Luis Miguel's number one fan. I said, no, I'm number one. No, no.

[02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:59.380]
Oh, I was a teenager working at a zyrster here in Miami. I met a guy who just seemed like another unreliable employee. Mr. Lot of days came in late. His mother or wife would often call in sick for him. He had less to say.

[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:10.000]
Dude was drinking probably was soon fired to do. Older Cuban employees who knew him, but were shocked at how steeply it fallen from the pinnacle of fame told me who he was. The Luis Bravo.

[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:21.660]
Luisito at the height of his fame in the late 50s, early 60s, he was he was called the Elvis Presley of Cuba. But by then he had just become a sad shadow of his former self. Now a pitiful alcoholic.

[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:36.040]
I think he died just a few months thereafter. He had another victim of the great Cuban revolution says the gravity guy. You ever hear of Luis Bravo? Yeah. I've heard a Joe Bravo. He's a jockey. Oh Luis Bravo. You did hear of? I heard the name.

[02:35:37.380 --> 02:36:05.900]
And and nothing. I've heard somebody say it was he is going to see that cruise. I don't know. One can only assume. Let's see. Here's one that says I love Taco Bell. I eat there regularly. I read an article a few years back that said Taco Bell uses fourth grade meat. This grade is used in dog food probably cat food to second. We noticed the white chunks in the meat. That is bone. So they take meat and the bone grind it up. So I stopped eating there. Well, you people are so negative around Taco.

[02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:26.260]
I don't care. I mean, you know, when you stop and think about all the different kind of food like hot dogs that we have a good guy and every time when you see documentaries about those food processing plants in Chicago or Denver. Whoever they are and Omaha. Good.

[02:36:26.740 --> 02:36:33.540]
And we just pretend that that doesn't go on and that by the time it gets packaged and delivered to us that it's just fine

[02:36:33.540 --> 02:36:39.880]
This can be and sanitary and safe and we sprinkle a little this on that and a little that and it's delicious, you know

[02:36:40.860 --> 02:36:44.580]
Isn't that all pretty much what we care about with who that tastes good?

[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:49.580]
Oh, no, you're wrong Neil people eat food because it's good for you. Yeah, huh?

[02:36:51.020 --> 02:36:55.800]
Robert's here is this why does so few speak up for Gaza? Oh, there you go again, you don't know what you're talking about

[02:36:56.480 --> 02:36:58.880]
Why are we so indifferent to the death of destruction in Gaza?

[02:36:59.180 --> 02:37:04.320]
He wants to know the major news outlets meekly except that israel's banning of journalists from entering Gaza's and excuse for downplaying

[02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:08.760]
Collateral civilian casualties our president elect Barack Obama's had little to say about an invasion

[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:16.100]
It'll much complicate his future Middle East peace efforts and most commentators easily rationalize israel's many more eyes for an eye killings

[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:23.980]
Why is it that there's such widespread acceptance beginning with the apologetic arguments of president Bush that whatever israel does is always justified as

[02:37:23.980 --> 02:37:26.400]
Necessary to the survival of the Jewish state it is not

[02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:30.120]
While the Hamas rocket attacks are reprehensible

[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:36.220]
There also an ineffectual challenge to israel's enormous security apparatus and the severity of israel's response to them is counterproductive

[02:37:36.780 --> 02:37:42.960]
Clearly the very existence of israel is not now nor is it ever has it ever been seriously challenged by anything the Palestinians did

[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:49.760]
Not back in 1948 when israel was established as a state within significant Palestinian military resistance north of the time of the

[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:53.600]
1967 six-day war with Egypt when Egypt Syria and Jordan fought Israel

[02:37:54.880 --> 02:38:00.080]
The Palestinians were in no position to confront the israeli army because those whose lands were not already occupied by israel

[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:04.400]
We're living under oppressive Egyptian control in Gaza and tough to your Indian rule in the West Bank

[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:12.260]
After the speedy israeli victory which demolished the myth of the new states of vulnerability the Palestinians became imprisoned as a people by israel for crimes they hadn't committed

[02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:20.180]
Even if we accept the harshest portrayal of the tactics and motives of the Palestinian movements against israel after this to six-day war and

[02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:25.980]
What point did that terrorism represent a serious challenge to the survival of the Jewish people or the state that claims to speak in their name?

[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:34.940]
Yet their survival is in vote to justify the vastly excessive use of force by the israeli war machine with frequent allusions to the holocaust previously visited upon the Jewish people

[02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:41.120]
I'll haunt holocaust that had nothing to do with the Palestinians or Muslims and everything to do with central Europeans claiming to be Christians

[02:38:41.900 --> 02:38:44.760]
the high moral claim of the Israeli occupation test

[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:51.400]
Rest not on the objective reality of a Palestinian threat to Israel's survival the rather on the non-sequitur cry that never again

[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:55.460]
Should harm come to Jews as it did in central central Europe seven decades ago

[02:38:55.460 --> 02:39:00.920]
The basic argument is that Palestinian terrorists represented by Hamas are given to an irrational hatred of Jews

[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:04.160]
So profound that it invalidates their movement even when they win elections

[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:10.520]
There was not the view of the Israeli security service when it earlier supported Hamas as the alternative to the dreaded PLO

[02:39:11.140 --> 02:39:17.320]
Also history is replete with examples of terrorists becoming statesmen even within the early ranks of Jews fighting to establish the state of Israel

[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:21.200]
One of those was Monachem Began who went on to be elected leader of the new state

[02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:28.520]
But before Began attained that respectability back in 1948 when he visited the US a prominent group of Jewish intellectuals including Albert Einstein

[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:35.400]
Sidney Hook and Hanna Arant wrote a letter to the New York Times warning that Began was a former leader of the Irgun a terrorist right wing

[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:37.020]
Shovonist organization in Palestine

[02:39:37.020 --> 02:39:44.680]
The letter urged Jews to Sean Began arguing it's inconceivable that those who oppose fascism throughout the world if correctly informed as to Mr

[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:48.760]
Began's political record and perspectives could add their names in support to the move any represents

[02:39:49.700 --> 02:39:56.860]
Began's new party was then participating in the Israeli election and Einstein and his colleagues many of whom like the physicists had been victims of German fascism

[02:39:56.860 --> 02:39:57.960]
stated today

[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:04.960]
They speak of freedom democracy and anti imperialism whereas until recently they openly preached the doctrine of the fascist state in its actions

[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:08.240]
It is in its actions that the terrorist party betrays its real character

[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:13.340]
Those actions were then detailed in the letter they included the systematic terrorizing of innocent Palestinians

[02:40:13.340 --> 02:40:18.660]
Manimum and children in an effort to force them to flee the territory that Began's party claimed for the new state of Israel

[02:40:19.340 --> 02:40:24.700]
Clearly Began and his political errors who include Benjamin Netanyahu the most likely victor in the next Israeli election

[02:40:24.700 --> 02:40:26.060]
evolved in their behavior

[02:40:26.060 --> 02:40:31.360]
But I bring it up now to highlight the one-sided reporting of the current phase of this interminable conflict and to wonder

[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:40.100]
Where are the voices that reflect the uncompromising morality of Einstein's generation of Jewish intellectuals willing to acknowledge fault and humanity on both sides of the political equation?

[02:40:40.700 --> 02:40:43.480]
That's Robert Cheers take on it, but he knows so little about it, you know

[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.840]
Right straight to these got such a strong opinion anti-Science

[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:52.320]
Howard David's a bitch

[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:08.840]
People hitting homes from work late one night when they fall

[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:16.340]
The fine on the fast food line they pulled in and gave their order to the girl and the next thing you know

[02:41:16.340 --> 02:41:17.580]
They've started to

[02:41:17.580 --> 02:41:21.220]
And Taco Bell this stomach started to blow

[02:41:21.220 --> 02:41:24.780]
In Taco Bell a burning inside their throat

[02:41:24.780 --> 02:41:28.920]
It had a smell that's when they started to blow not feeling well

[02:41:52.740 --> 02:41:55.740]
That's when they started to blow not feeling well

[02:41:56.740 --> 02:42:00.620]
From the bean burrito you should have skipped the damn Chalupa

[02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:04.000]
You might not have made but super

[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:10.820]
Next time you pass the sign say no even though it's grilled so it's good to go

[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:18.080]
People got sick and wish that they're on the gun so they could hunt down the people who think outside the bar

[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:24.120]
The pain from the crams they felt deep in their gut so next time they'll just go to pizza

[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:29.060]
Not Taco Bell this stomach started to blow from Taco Bell

[02:42:29.060 --> 02:42:35.860]
A burning inside their throat it had a smell that's when they started to blow not feeling well

[02:42:35.860 --> 02:42:37.760]
From the bean burrito

[02:42:41.660 --> 02:42:45.680]
14 or 2 or 5 species of IQMC this is another thing

[02:42:48.740 --> 02:42:53.020]
It's my whatever we like whatever I like you like it's no good. Oh

[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:59.680]
Here's an email to prove it how does someone talk about the great food in Italy and then talk about craving Taco Bell and Red Lobster

[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:06.600]
Your taste is unbelievable I didn't like that so I can't even enjoy the foods that I like

[02:43:07.420 --> 02:43:12.860]
Taco Bell haven't been there in the least a year and Red Lobster I don't know maybe two or three times a year

[02:43:12.860 --> 02:43:17.360]
I mean all these times you know you sometimes eat a weenie during the show you know you go in the refrigerator

[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:23.440]
You get a weenie out you know you've ever taken that much crap in the hot dogs made with lips and floor sweeping

[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:26.520]
No that's what I was saying before

[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:31.580]
Right a lot of the stuff that we'd if you knew what was in it you know but we don't want to know and don't investigate

[02:43:31.580 --> 02:43:38.240]
And the body does a great job of like digesting this stuff and the processing it and dumping it out and that's it

[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:44.480]
Craving Taco Bell and Red Lobster your taste is unbelievable

[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:51.440]
Would I rather be in Rome right now and go downstairs to my favorite restaurant and have a wonderful bowl of pasta?

[02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:55.840]
Yes but I'm not there

[02:43:59.540 --> 02:44:00.220]
Well why not?

[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:08.620]
That's a good question I could be not good for my diabetes then neither and either we're going to sell that stuff at Taco Bell

[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:16.200]
I don't think the chowda is a good either when you think it's got a lot of carbs it's got taters in it probably taters

[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:24.300]
Bad Dennis says I love the chicken taco sell they had a Taco Bell my wife absolutely hated because like you said they used the lowest quality meat

[02:44:24.300 --> 02:44:31.620]
But what the hell can they do to a chicken? Does anyone know if their chickens are Schmidt? I'm serious I'd like to know since Dennis he's eating the chickens at Taco Bell

[02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:36.380]
You ever see those documentaries about chickens? Oh yeah

[02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:38.500]
They're nervous

[02:44:40.860 --> 02:44:49.920]
Jason Jason just obsessed from plantation keeper Calvin Jason he says try the new Chick-fil-A at the public's plaza sunrise in Flamingo right by my house

[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:53.600]
I like Chick-fil-A I don't think I've ever had Chick-fil-A that's good

[02:44:56.480 --> 02:44:57.280]
Is it?

[02:44:57.960 --> 02:44:58.820]
Well I'll be damned

[02:44:59.980 --> 02:45:07.080]
And Jason also says in one of his 8,000 emails why don't the 7-0 tribe build a big ass hard rock aceto and gase and give them all a damn job

[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:11.400]
Yeah, then instead of throwing them little rocks they can throw a hard rock huh?

[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:17.740]
I'm just really see there you're going again with your anti Israel. Oh here's Amy Goodman on truth dig dot com

[02:45:18.780 --> 02:45:23.080]
Israeli voices for peace just this one more and then we'll be out of time anyway

[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:30.020]
This is from Amy Goodman's the host of democracy now a daily international TV and radio news hour airing on 500 stations in North America

[02:45:30.780 --> 02:45:38.640]
He says Israel's assault on Gaza by air see in now land is killed at the time of this writing more than 600 Palestinians with more than 2700 injured

[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:42.600]
10 Israelis have been killed three of them Israeli soldiers killed by friendly fire

[02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:49.220]
Beyond the deaths and injuries the people of Gaza are suffering a dire humanitarian crisis that is dismissed by the Israeli government

[02:45:49.220 --> 02:45:51.860]
There is however Israeli opposition to the military assault

[02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:57.520]
Israeli professor Nive Gordon is chair of the Department of Politics and Government at Ben-Gurian University in the negative

[02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:00.340]
Of southern Israel the region most impacted by the Hamas rockets

[02:46:01.180 --> 02:46:06.220]
Speaking over the phone from beer Shiba Gordon said we just had a rocket about an hour ago not far from our house

[02:46:06.220 --> 02:46:11.340]
My two children have been sleeping in a bomb shelter for the past week and then I think what Israel is doing is outrageous

[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:17.320]
The problem is that most Israelis say Israel left the Gaza strips three years ago and Hamas is still shooting rockets at us

[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:23.400]
They forget the details the detail is that Israel maintains sovereignty the detail is that Palestinians live in a cage

[02:46:23.400 --> 02:46:27.460]
The detail is that they don't get basic foodstuffs they don't get electricity they don't get water

[02:46:27.460 --> 02:46:31.480]
And when you forget these kinds of details all you say is why are they still shooting at us?

[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:35.640]
That's what the media here have been pumping them with then you think this war is rational

[02:46:35.640 --> 02:46:40.620]
If you look at what's been going on with the guys of spirit in the past three years and you see what Israel has been doing to the Palestinians

[02:46:40.620 --> 02:46:45.540]
You would think that the Palestinian resistance is rational and that's what's missing in the mainstream media here

[02:46:46.700 --> 02:46:51.400]
Gordon attended a large peach march a piece march last weekend in Tel Aviv with more than 10,000 other Israelis

[02:46:51.400 --> 02:47:02.740]
Long time Israeli peace activist Yuri on Neri was there he called the invasion of criminal war because on top of everything else it is openly and shamelessly part of Ahoob Barak's and Speak Bee Livney's election campaign

[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:07.920]
AQ's Barak I've exploiting the Israeli defense for soldiers in order to get more kinesid seats

[02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:13.420]
AQ's Livney of advocating mutual slaughter in order to become Prime Minister Israel's elections will be in February

[02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:21.400]
The assault strengthens right wing the food party leader and former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a foremost hawk and leading candidate for Prime Minister

[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:29.500]
While Netanyahu fully supports the attack on Gaza his nephew Jonathan Ben-Artsi is an Israeli conscientious objector

[02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:35.080]
Who was court-martialed and imprisoned for a year and a half he spoke to me from Providence Rhode Island where he's a student at Brown University

[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:41.300]
I'm speaking not as anyone's nephew but as an Israeli trying to speak out to Americans and tell them you don't have to support Israel blindly

[02:47:41.300 --> 02:47:47.860]
Not everything that Israel does is holy sometimes you have to speak firmly to Israel and tell us tell our government stop doing this

[02:47:48.740 --> 02:47:52.340]
Gideon Levy is a Jewish journalist with an Israeli newspaper Haaretz

[02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:59.880]
He told me I think that Israel had this legitimacy to protect its citizens in the southern part of Israel but doing something doesn't mean this brutal and violent operation

[02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:07.580]
I believe we could have gotten a new truth without this bloodshed immediately to send dozens of jets to bomb a totally helpless civilian society with hundreds of bombs

[02:48:07.580 --> 02:48:18.080]
Just today they were bearing five sisters. I mean this is unheard of this cannot go on like this but it is the UN Relief and Workstagency UN RWA and Gaza open up schools to provide shelter since

[02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:27.220]
Gossens trapped in this narrow strip of land had no place to flee Christopher Guinness of UN RWA told me that the agency provided the coordinates of the schools to the Israeli military

[02:48:27.220 --> 02:48:30.860]
Never less at least two schools have been hit by Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours

[02:48:30.860 --> 02:48:39.960]
Three people were killed at the Asm Elementary School more than 30 reported dead more than 55 injured at the Al-Fakura School in the Jevalier refugee camp in Gaza

[02:48:42.060 --> 02:48:51.280]
While Israeli planes dropped pamphlets urging Palestinians to leave the one and a half million residents of the Gaza strip perhaps the most densely populated place on earth have no place to run, no place to hide

[02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:59.500]
Calls for an immediate ceasefire ignored by Israel and blocked by the US government. It's not clear what you about administration will do but the people of Gaza can't wait until the inauguration

[02:48:59.500 --> 02:49:02.500]
There must be a ceasefire now and that's just the beginning

[02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:04.200]
Sazami

[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:06.280]
All right

[02:49:06.280 --> 02:49:11.140]
And ever less how could you have such strong opinions when you know your knowledge is so superficial now

[02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:14.760]
Right?

[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:16.160]
What do you know about it?

[02:49:16.340 --> 02:49:16.780]
That's right

[02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:24.100]
You self-hating Jew bastard your grand your parents and your grandparents are ruling in their graves. I doubt it

[02:49:24.100 --> 02:49:25.700]
I don't think they're moving around too much

[02:49:28.900 --> 02:49:33.740]
Angelo in Fort Lauderdale says when you say tacos say Viva Olay

[02:49:41.740 --> 02:49:48.740]
When the sun beats down and burns the top of my head

[02:49:50.740 --> 02:49:58.080]
And when my employees laugh at me I wish I were dead

[02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:06.720]
I got a ball spot and top of me

[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:08.980]

All up to you

[02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:23.600]
He's got a ball spot just like a billion balls

[02:50:23.600 --> 02:50:28.080]
He's got a ball spot I feel three inches tall

[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:29.860]
He's got a ball spot

[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:32.860]
Please help me run both heels

[02:50:32.860 --> 02:50:37.200]
He's got a ball spot I know how Larry King feels

[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:39.200]
He's got a ball spot

[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:40.940]
Ball spot

[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:48.700]
Oh when I painted my head my wife she said she's out of here

[02:50:50.580 --> 02:50:57.360]
And when I go to the John the guys are using my head for a mirror

[02:50:59.320 --> 02:51:06.920]
I've got a ball spot on top of me

[02:51:08.700 --> 02:51:08.760]
Yeah

[02:51:09.700 --> 02:51:15.620]

[02:51:15.620 --> 02:51:17.420]
All up to you

[02:51:18.320 --> 02:51:23.360]
He's got a ball spot just like a billion balls

He's got a ball spot I feel three inches tall

[02:51:27.760 --> 02:51:29.820]
He's got a ball spot

[02:51:29.820 --> 02:51:37.040]
He's got a ball spot I know how Larry King feels

[02:51:37.040 --> 02:51:39.140]
He's got a ball spot

[02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:41.380]
Bye bye
