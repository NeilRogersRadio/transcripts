[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.520]
Problems right I can tell I got lots of fill of you to put away. His name was Moe Gray. Yeah, this was a great man

[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.360]
Man of vision and guts

[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.080]
And there isn't even a plaque or signpost or statue of him in that time

[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.320]
someone

[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.280]
But a bullet throw his eye

[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.600]
No one knows who gave the order

[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:09.780]
But I heard it wasn't angry. I knew Moe. I knew he was headstrong talking loud saying stupid things

[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.600]
So when he turned up dead

[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.520]
I let it go

[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.040]
And I said to myself

[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.160]
This is the business we've chosen I didn't ask

[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.220]
Okay, the order

[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.000]
Because it had nothing to do with business

[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.100]
You know who I am I'm Moe Green. I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders

[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.540]
You

[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:25.120]
Okay, so anyway, how do I clear the cache now you you know how to do it right F2 F2 F2 again

[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.940]
Highlight one of those things in there and it should be highlighted already something in there

[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.960]
What do you mean in that window in other words the F2 will bring it down to the play window

[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.340]
so

[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.420]

[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.980]
Yeah, and then now press enter a whole bunch of times or just hold the enter key down until everything clears out of there

[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.840]

[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.460]
In fact, how did I get those godfather drops in there if I didn't know what I was doing right

[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.300]
For example your father did business with Hyman Ruff your father respected Iman Ruff

[00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:03.500]
But your father never trusted Iman Ruff in my home in my bedroom where my wife sleeps

[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.120]
Well my children come and play with their toys

[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.940]
They come and play with their toys at any rate. Yeah, we got a bunch of droppings whoopie do

[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.680]
I'm I'm I don't know I say it, but I don't really mean it. I'm a little godfather burned out

[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.720]
You people at AMC get it get another movie

[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:30.080]
Get another flick and what's the point of showing the godfather they they use they do the sterile version of it

[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.240]
The antithec version

[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.240]
Well, let's AFC for you. Mm-hmm

[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.100]
They're a little bit the queasy now. Yeah, I just don't get it the whole thing

Yeah, pretty we he's asking Clementsa how bad's the war gonna be and Clementsa says pretty GD bad

[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.940]
See, I can't say it either right

[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.660]
And so they take the GD out and he says pretty damn bad

[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.600]
They they're all kinds of little places in there where they do that the meantime

[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.400]
They're blowing each other's brain job

[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.160]
We've blood and guts the scene with sonny getting shot on the causeway could there possibly be anything more violent than that

[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.060]

Who Lee?

[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:06.400]
Flea. Oh my god. It's a movie about the Naples Mafia. Nothing like the godfather though Gamora

[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.780]
Not to be confused with Sodom because there's no H on the end of it. So it must be a different Gamora

[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.440]
I don't know and I don't care next Friday is good Friday

[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.840]
So I guess that means this Friday is bad Friday. What a stupid bunch of crap all these and Pesok is coming. Oh

[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:21.480]

[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:27.340]

If I haven't to go buy it

[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.760]
Well, if was awful, why would you go buy it? Because somebody might want it. I would steal it anyway, so

[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.440]
Save me the trouble of stealing it

[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:50.580]
Brandon says all that one guy's gonna get really upset. Oh there he goes with Brandon again. What's the big service with Brandon?

[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.920]
I don't know he just said something's worthwhile

[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.060]
As opposed to where where

[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.740]
And then I am taking your advice like for example the fake Greg Budele

[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.840]
I'm not the reading his crap anymore whether it's real or fake. I don't care

[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.480]
Not interested in you Greg never was and never will be and nobody else cares about you either

[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.580]
Stay there in Alabama with a banjo on your thing you jackass

[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.020]
I'm not reading those I'm just deleting them immediately

[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.700]
See there's a whole there's this whole bunch of radio misfits

[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:25.420]
It's good word for including still on here in the market. Although nobody knows where they are if they're on

[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:34.160]
But they're just dying for attention. So they want to use me as a conduit through which to gain attention. Yep. Not gonna do it

[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:40.280]
Nobody cares about those people and then and mine in most cases nobody remembers who the hell they were anyway

[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.180]
Right am I right? Yeah, so freaking loot me absolutely right

[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.740]

[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:53.900]
Oh small potato people from a hundred years ago small potato even frankie pentangio by whatever's name was pentangely

[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.240]

Oh, I got a knife in his body must know what he's yelling out there. I want to know

[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.780]
Some body that who cares how you know I do he says it hoits probably

[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:24.800]
Anyway, Brandon says I wish that would show the complete saga where it's one and two combined oh yeah, I am see

[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.820]
We need a lot more godfather an AMC not

I think they only got like about ten movies left

[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:37.600]
In addition to the movie being shown in order we see in one and two one the day Clemens have found him and Roth and give him a job working for Vito

[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:43.280]
Really yep, too when Connie's wedding was over Vito Michael Sonny fray to one time go to visit

Clemensi pulls over to make a call and when he turns the corner he actually goes into a restaurant. He's some spaghetti

[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.120]
Huh

[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.120]
For we see the day Vito and Clemensi meet Tessio for the first time in five

[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:08.860]
We see Sonny tells mama who's cooking dinner Vito was shot and then he makes a call to Tessio to get everybody together get some buttons out on the street

[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.260]
Well

[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:18.500]
While Frado was sitting on the sitting on the curb rocking back and forth with his head and his head again

[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:19.660]

[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:26.220]

[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.440]
This doesn't make any sense and now that they now that we had an African American elected this person

[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.460]
There wasn't anything better they can do because getting a woman elected would be crazy

[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:30.420]
So they figure they'll get the dolphins into the Super Bowl as the sports animal

[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.280]

The Ashall Hammond 24, River Phoenix 21, how come there's an S on River?

[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.240]
I guess he won't care about that

[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.740]
I can't do it now

[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.120]

Well I haven't said that check out for those guys

[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.440]
I guess he's not a Moneymaker

[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.960]
I don't think about it

[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.000]
I'm still pissed off about that whole thing with the website

[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.320]
Thewqm.com website, somebody should rot in hell for that thing

[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.440]
It's the biggest piece I've turned

[00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:00.320]
I know that Flea is making a, you know, an effort to try to like do something with it

[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.620]
What kind of name is that, Jacka Root?

[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.860]
Funny, Jacka Root

[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.120]
Tan Tran 1 and Slash has none

[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.420]

[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.740]
How about Luke Aburatsi?

[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:39.940]
There you go

[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.440]
I noticed that because I was keeping an eye on it

[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.060]
Because people were sending in more suggestions

[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.420]
People were sending in names of fictitious characters

[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.180]
As cool names

[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.040]
As always, you know, answering the question they want to answer

[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.440]
Oh my god, sometimes it gets so overwhelmed by life

[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.040]
You know what I mean?

[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.240]
I just want to plot

[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.800]
Oh and your friend PR Ralph came through for us

[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.100]
What did I do with it?

[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:04.820]
I didn't print it out

[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:09.900]
Yeah, he's the only observant Catholic or at least one that knows what's going on

[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.680]
I didn't print it out?

[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.880]
Oh yeah, here it is

[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.300]

[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.020]

That's what he says, the subject Holy Schedule

[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.420]
I looked at this and I thought Holy Moly, right man?

[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.960]
Those tights are getting tighter all the time Robin

[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.620]
There's that one drop in, I just, as long as I live, I will never forget it

[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:36.600]
There are a few

[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.340]

[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.240]
Here you go

[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.740]
He was his ward, not his pedophile

[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.920]
I mean, talk about things that make no sense, but nevertheless

[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.920]
Palm Sunday April 5, that's this Sunday

That's right

[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.180]
Good Friday, next Friday the 10th

[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.600]
Easter, next Sunday the 12th

[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.960]
Oh let's get out the Easter Bunny and all the Easter eggs

[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.820]
You think Obama's going to have an Easter egg hunt on the White House lawn?

[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:34.860]
He might

[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.100]
Don't they all eat your Monday is April 13th

[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:42.180]
I think we talked about that last year, I never had heard about it before last year or the year before

[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:42.460]
No

[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.380]
What is Easter Monday?

[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.560]
I don't know the sleep in day, the ocult

[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.660]
Is that like boxing day?

[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.380]
The day after Christmas and other holiday?

[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.160]

[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.560]
Holocaust Remberedst day 4.21

[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.560]

[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.060]
An administrative, what?

[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.180]

He's got two, I guarantee he's the only person in this whole building it's got two cars in the parking garage

[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.060]
I'm going to get him a gift

[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.700]
You should live so long Paco or whatever your name is PR Ralph you get him a gift

[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.680]
Michelle and Key West has missed you yesterday

[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.440]
Please take care of yourself and watch your blood sugar

[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.440]
I think I'm on the way out

[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.260]
I think one of these days soon I'm going to be saying I'm dying out of here

[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:32.900]
I really do

[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.540]
No

[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.100]
I feel like death today, death boiled over

[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.480]
Where did that expression come from?

[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.600]
Death warmed over

[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.460]
I don't know

[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.180]
Maybe because your brain

[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.980]
Jorge says what?

[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:44.880]
Huh?

[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.280]
Jorge says I just heard the spot

[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:56.860]
A 940 this is basically we helped elect Obama now we're switching formats maybe we can get the dolphins to the Super Bowl

[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.740]
I think there was a better odds for a black president in the White House than the dolphins in the Super Bowl says Jorge

[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:07.120]
I thought we had enough sports under that already with QM in 790 and you're forgetting the other 25 sports stations

[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:14.500]
Steve Lapa and his 45-10 watch stations you know 640 and 850 and 14 this and the 19 that oh god

[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.140]
They must have all been listening to Ray Perry

[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.700]
Oh if we had a lot more sports talk station to bring a lot more people to sports talk

[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.380]
Yeah, you can tell that with those numbers that start with a

[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:23.640]
Oh

[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.000]
On those James Crystal station those are the kind of station that Norma Kent likes

[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.460]
I haven't heard from her in ages and you know what spy with me he's got nothing to report

[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.920]
I made this deal and it is what it is you know I just filled out that talent sheet for March

[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:45.040]
Mm-hmm makes me again want to put my head in my hands and cry like Fredo again

[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:45.840]
Again

[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:53.280]
But that's the way jolly joe belted I guess these people were pressured I guess they knew there was going to be a big economic meltdown

[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:54.400]
Yeah

[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:00.420]
Do you believe that no I think they're just a bunch of cheap hard ass bastards I want to screw me over and everybody else too in the Humper

[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:03.080]
The Humper of course still had ESPN to fall back on

[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.620]
It's always good to have something else to fall back on George like your relationship with the people at Gullstream

[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.320]
You know he's going to work there you could be a jockey I could be a handicap or a handicap

[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.580]
I still thinking about that one horse on a Friday I feel so bad about that

[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.700]
I mean he was right there he had all all the reason in the world to win

[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:28.520]
He stalked the pace on the inside saved all the ground and then when they came to the top of the stretch he just

[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.700]
Pukes guts out I hate horses like that pukes

[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.880]
You know what I mean yep

[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.060]
Gutless spineless painting pigs

[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.840]
God

[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.300]
Crusture supreme

[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:44.480]
He is on the pylons 4th and he is about 4 and a half length soft

[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.700]
Oh it's George and Downs

[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.400]
There's my man Anthony McDonald in the pocket no chance Anthony's 21 to 1

[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.560]
You know I don't I really don't even know what I like about him

[00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:00.620]
One thing about jockeys and harness racing drivers the racing world is done a really poor job of

[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:07.220]
And this is one of the reasons they're both dying is that the personalities are the horses and then you know most people can't relate to a horse

[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.840]
Right but do we ever see the jockeys or the drivers we know what they look like to when you know anything about them

[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:20.840]
Yeah most of no right one or two like Jerry Bailey you know Jerry Bailey who in a bar coa

[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:28.140]
Oh yeah well and ischkovibble and makes you pisher 1041 at 560 WQM

[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.040]

Hey it's Vince here for the sham out a towel that soaks up anything you won't believe this friggin towel

[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:40.780]
Soaks up water milk cool aid hook a blood your own blood after hook a bite your tongue the tears that you can't stop shedding

[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:47.200]
Once you realize that your career is over before it ever really started soda everything the sham out call now because you know we can't do this all day

[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.880]
We're busy waiting for our lawyers to get to the station so we can tell the cops exactly what happened

[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.500]
I'm Vince for the sham out my life is over order now

[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.340]

[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:03.100]
That is very cute sham out you're gonna be saying wow sham wow but I don't know this thing just sells itself

[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:09.080]
So what the hell we need you for right that I was up a few points 45 nothing to get too excited about nothing to start

[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:18.960]
I'm very depressed about this email from Kathy follow up do you have said anything bad about her I just said her email was somewhat in coherent

[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:26.820]
Well you're you're bad now and she was her way not to she says I give up can't win with you I try to write in with stuff that's interesting in time

[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:30.680]
And at the same time not become a pain except maybe with George behind the scenes about hell's kitchen

[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:36.640]
If I go into all the details of something a bitch said this thing just goes on and on and on

[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:46.880]
So I write today there was an announcement on 940 that sounded like an official announcement of the format change they've been delaying denying only that it was done in such a joking way that considering what date is it was hard to tell it was real

[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:55.360]
I try to keep it brief for you and you can't understand it and I need help buy just Kathy how do you like that hostile now you're chasing her way too

[00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:03.080]
What a bastard you're a mean man I talk about a bunch of sensitive people if you're sensitive don't be emailing this show

[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:18.940]
No sense of humor my god and you can't understand it I need help if you take it personal Kathy maybe you do need help I don't know buy buy Kathy you can't win with me honey

[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:28.080]
It was it was in coherent it didn't make any sense and I know sometimes people they do that it makes sense to them but then you try to read it to the make a sense to you

[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.160]
That's me I chase everybody away sooner or later

[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:43.880]
Dick trickle 87 evil can evil 77 and Basil Rathbone 54 those are the contenders on your poll right on I'm gonna change the poll so do you

Because I got one on there we've done all these other ones but I don't care. Oh, yeah, who does?

[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:07.940]
Well look at that there's also one for the next day on here. I'm getting so far ahead of myself look at that the thing I hate most about living in South Florida is blank

[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:15.300]
Look at all the choices unverable heat from eight or October old parts that drive way too slow

[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:22.720]
Cubans who votes pink English in an elevator cops pigs who hide behind trees and stalk innocent civilians that's that's here too everywhere

[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:31.940]
Ask clowns who talk during movies criminal County commissioners and politicians sharing oxygen with H. Wayne High Zenga now that's bad a shot at

[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.420]
Valdi but it's well deserved

[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:41.500]
Rampant crime and murders French Canadians on Hollywood Beach I'm I'm voting for that one antiquated roads and transportation

[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.180]
System too many shopping malls and dirty bookstores

[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:54.700]
Root customers a service that most stores and restaurants pathetic sports franchises David Samson and Luria stealing tax money from taxpayers to fund a stadium and waiting online at restaurants

[00:35:54.700 --> 00:36:03.500]
I'm voting for French Canadians on Hollywood Beach and elsewhere wherever they are I'm voting for that road system because that's the closest thing to the traffic we got on here

[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:26.120]

[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:31.280]
but that's just keep getting better and better they did and her uh... keeps

[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.400]
hanging out which probably sentry thank you card

[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.060]
you know thanks brittany

[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.040]
for hanging out

[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.780]
maybe we should have the pacco bankrupt the concert you stay closer and

[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.140]
i guess you could have probably some

[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:41.640]
what

[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:43.680]
that he hang out with her

[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.740]
i don't know i doubted

[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:50.100]
opulsmith other fake creation of john ztr i'm sure

[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:51.880]
says never too late

[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.540]
kneel good friday's a holiday for all christians

[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:58.740]
I listen to your show, but sir, I do not appreciate. I do not approve of your Christian bashing.

[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.420]
Stop it once, or I'll be forced to stop listening to you. Govern yourself accordingly.

[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.240]
Oh, this is crazy. What's his name?

[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:05.940]
Rario.

[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.320]
Whatever is the highlight. Yeah, I'm telling you.

[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:13.560]
This is the day the Lord has made and enjoyed it and give praise to his name. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Give praise to a name.

[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:17.340]
Oh, yeah. How do you holy God? Yeah, no, no, no, yeah. Screw you.

[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:21.860]
It's never too late to accept the Lord and be saved. Remember, eternity is forever.

[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.820]
Do you want to spend it in heaven or hell? God bless you and George.

[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.940]
Well, thank you.

[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.420]
How do you even sneeze you at this morning? Why sure sneeze a lot on Monday?

[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:32.840]
Yeah, you did. Did I?

[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.620]
A little bit. Not just on the air. I'm talking about all days.

[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.060]
Oh, sneezing and weezing and sneezing and sneezing and weezing.

[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:44.700]
Oh, maybe it's my life allergy. I think I'm becoming allergic to life in my old age.

[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.200]
Maybe it's my I my QAM. I don't know what station is this QAM allergy. I OD.

[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:57.120]
So we got the train coming tomorrow and then sometime this weekend 940 goes all sports.

[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:02.700]
Oh, I got a thing about that. I never got to muddy a hailedide.

[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:10.820]
I haven't got to the Jamaican thing yet or the Conficker virus or the Rush Limboff failure.

[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:14.360]
Billboards. Oh, don't tell me I don't have it.

[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:17.920]
That would be really, really bad. Oh,

[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.740]
you've got to be schmitting me. Oh, no.

[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:30.340]
You wish when I picked Tom Jicca, but it was a lengthy rub down and run down on the whole 940

[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:34.880]
thing. Can you believe I don't have it? I believe it.

[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.900]
Oh, here it is. Oh, I knew. I knew in my heart of hearts as they say.

[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.940]
And I hate people and say that stupid crap. To my heart of hearts.

[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.980]
Yeah, where is that exactly? Like in the middle of your heart?

[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:49.340]
Yeah, no, it's in the middle of your ass.

[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.840]
Clear channel on sports on Wions 940.

[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.820]
It was reported in the Miami Herald that we could go that clear channel would flip Wions 940

[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.020]
back to sports. We've been telling you about this for weeks and weeks and weeks. Have a way?

[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:08.580]
Yep. We've been on top of it, baby. If it's happening on your radio, in your radio, or even deep inside

[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:14.600]
your, we know it. It was originally a sports talk station from 2001 to 2004 before flipping

[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:20.720]
well, the first you don't succeed. Try try again. I think what Tom means is fail again.

[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:27.500]
The first incarnation was build 940 Fox Sports and the call letters actually were WRFX.

[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:32.060]
Remember that? Yep. WRFX. And just before they went all sports, that's when Rick and Spud were

[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:38.040]
doing mornings on there. Wasn't it? That sounds about right? And failed miserably because Rick

[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:41.400]
was doing a stock market report every day. By the way, the thousand 42 points.

[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:49.440]
Well, there's Gordon Brown talk about a constipated bridge. We must stand. He is the epitome of what

[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:54.840]
everybody hates about the Brits. Well, following that constipated held a bag. Stodgy.

[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.700]
Boring. Anyway, it says that it's line up included only one show that was considered original

[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:05.680]
programming. That show was veteran sports talker Jorge Sedano, Waxi Miami in afternoon drive.

[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:10.820]
Their morning show was a time by should that surprise anyone? Keep channel making a money grab?

[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:17.420]
Hosted by Carl Foster unemployed now and need a mark. CSP and radio Baltimore and PM drive host.

[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:22.740]
Carl Foster. Remember that? Oh, the rest of the lineup was supplemented by Jim Rome in Fox Sports

[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:29.920]
radio. Oh, Rome. Hey, Rome. That's our home. That Rome. That was a 52 and a half point.

[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:34.740]
Anyway, the fake Tom jikas says the current incarnation, which looks to it there,

[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:38.800]
Waves either 413 or 420 will have a mixed syndication of first.

[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:48.000]
6 to 9 a.m. ESPN's Mike and Mike in the morning. Oh, my God. 9 a.m. to noon. The Dan Patrick show. Oh, my God.

[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:54.800]
noon to 3 Jim Roome. Oh, my God. 3 to 7 Fox Sports radio's Chris Meyer show. Oh, my God.

[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:59.820]
For some possible local programming, Jeff DeFloris or Sid Rosenberg unlikely at the start because

[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:04.240]
Chief Channel won't want to spend money. The White House Chief Channel would employ DeFloris since

[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:08.480]
he admitted to paying a Mikasuki Indian gaming marketing director kickbacks in 2002.

[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.520]
And to ensure he got the contract of broadcast television shows from its Tammy Amitriol

[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:17.760]
casino. DeFloris was arrested for the incident. Meanwhile, Rosenberg's at a non-competit of six

[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:24.700]
months since being ousted, canned at Waxi 790. So 3 to 7. It's another Fox syndicated show.

[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:30.960]
7 to 10 p.m. Fox Sports radio's Petros and Money. A good L.A. show. A terrible national show based on a

[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:37.300]
KLA CLA 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Fox Sports radio's veteran talker J.T. The brick. I remember where you

[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:43.500]
say I have J.T. The brick on where here. I made here. Oh, no, here. Was it I.O.D.? I don't know. No.

[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:51.040]
Who cares? And 2 to 6 a.m. Fox Sports radio sports soup. Some concoction VP Don Martin thought was

[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:55.760]
good. Where they replay the best segments of the day. Sounds like the cure for insomnia. This is

[00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:01.240]
little Tommy fake Tommy. So that's the scoop on W.I.N.Z 940. No word on what their moniker is yet.

[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:05.620]
I would guess something like 940. The animal or something real original like that.

[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:10.680]
Oh, wow.

[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:18.200]
Oh, Mady Hale died. I try to get all my deaths into the beginning.

[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:23.180]
Do you ever hear of Mady Hale Cowboy actor? No, Mady Hall. No, not Mady Hall.

[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:28.320]
Mady Hall was Canadian and Jewish. A.Is he dead? Mady Hale? I don't know. No, I think he's still alive.

[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:29.920]
I don't know. Google it. Do it.

[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:38.520]
And who is the announcer on a J.J. Stewart? Okay. What a memory for crap. Am I right, J.Stuart?

[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:42.940]
I'll take your word for it. Who is the announcer? Let's make a deal. Memory of glasses. He was kind of

[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:48.180]
a goofy looking guy. Maltese still kicking. Is he really? He takes a look at him. He's still kicking. How old is

[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:57.040]
he must be 110? He's born in 21. Oh my God. 89 and I. He's 98. 98 years old.

[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:07.380]
Don't have a duct date for him over here. Am I right? Or is it 88? 79.

[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:15.300]
Does it mean to do mouth? No, 8. I'm sorry. 88. 88 is great. 98 is a little bit too much. 88?

[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:21.140]
No problem with that. At least he outlive Merve Griffin anyway. Talentless queen. Merve Griffin.

[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:26.700]
I've got a lovely bunch of gokka. I keep proud to get you to play that. I don't want you to.

[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:33.080]
Mady Hale dies at 89. Well, I tell you, a lot of people live in the middle of a real old.

[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:41.820]
Cowboy actor helped fund the Ahthima Museum in LA. Memberginautri. Yep. Oh, and guess what?

[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:52.860]
Chicken accent me. I'll find it. Oh, I get it under H. O.A. I think. There it is.

[00:52:54.320 --> 00:53:06.200]
All you hold the orchestra. Gather round the radio. Now, again, here's my bestie. Are your skies all gray?

[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:13.900]
I have better blue. Well, they're great. Herb Oscar Anderson, W.A.V.C., did mornings there for 400 years.

[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:19.100]
What? I said, that's great that you have that note. Yeah, it is great. Although I like the Godfather,

[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:26.500]
drops better. I bet your Brandon squeezing himself from those Godfather drops. Did I play them all?

[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:36.780]
Oh, I like this. My offer is this. Nothing. Yeah, that's my deal with Norm Kentna. That's my offer.

[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:42.360]
Nothing. Oh, and then the one you like. The hotels here are bigger and swankier.

[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.040]
Then any of the broof tricks we got in there. The hotels here.

[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:54.760]
The money's on the table. Well, no, I have a partner. This is the business we've chosen.

[00:53:55.900 --> 00:54:01.280]
Well, he had a bad post-culture. Anyway, money here, one of the last to Hollywood

[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:10.040]
Selenoid Singh Cowboys and founder of what? Of something. It's now. Oh, I see. Founder of what is now

[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:14.200]
the Austrian National Center of the American West. Died. He was 89. He had been in failing health

[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:18.540]
and died Sunday of age-related causes at home in studio city. Well, how do you like that? Finally,

[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:25.260]
and honestly, died of age-related causes. 89? I think you get that old and sometimes

[00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:30.900]
so you're dying over there. The Lord didn't create us to live forever because the Lord's

[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:35.340]
a sadistic bastard so that we know the only thing we have to look forward to for sure is death

[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:41.260]
in taxes. In the 1940s, Hale was the top B western box office draw right along with Roy Rogers

[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:47.680]
Eddie, Eddie Dean. Never heard of him. Heard a Jimmy Dean and Hale's friend Jean Autry. Hale made

[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:52.380]
nearly 3,000 films for Republic Pictures, including 19 action and songpact films as the hero

[00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:57.560]
Mottie Hale. Later, he had small but memorable role as rock Hudson's lawyer, Bale Clinch,

[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:04.420]
in the 1956 epic giant. Hale made his debut in the small role of a singer in 1944 as the big

[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:08.620]
bananza. He had similar bits parts as cowboy, ranch, foreman, and several more westerns before

[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:12.800]
he was given his own series for Republic in 1946. You know what else Republic Movies made was

[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:21.860]
um Rocket Man. What is it called? That series? Yeah. Commander Cody. Commander Cody stuff?

[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:25.840]
Commander Cody in the something of death. I don't know what it's called. The Valley of Death.

[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.660]
I'm right. The moon rocked me. He was my hero. In fact, I'd like to put on one of them suits

[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:42.780]
right now and just turn that little knob and jump off the balcony. I'm gonna give it a

The else you remember Eddieillo Rick-San Curtisaccord Brastell Soybutt, but you know two weeks ago, I remember mah, I remember Jarl Bandfield and Clarins Ayaw trailer, Glen Quick and Raymond Four ...

[00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:02.460]
his nose? Queen Latifah sued a makeup artist and fashion stylist claim

[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:06.240]
incordinated lawsuits that they got ugly treatment from Queen Latifah when she

[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:11.620]
cheated them out of a million dollars. Celebrity Cosmetology consultant Roxana

[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:15.460]
Floyd says she lost 700 grand when the rapper actress failed to pay her for

[00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:20.700]
work she did between July 2005 and February 2008. In a separate lawsuit

[00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:24.260]
celebrity fashion stylist Susan Moses said she was treated of three

[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:28.540]
out cheated of 300 grand during the same period. The lawsuits were filed Monday

[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:32.540]
in federal court Manhattan. Amanda Silverman is spokeswoman for the actress whose

[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:36.180]
roles and movies included Harris, Brian, mad money says the lawsuits have no

[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:39.920]
merit but she can't can't come in more on pending litigation. Is that what they

[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:46.700]
always say? Yes. Baron Fitz says in response to your poll there is absolutely

[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:49.620]
nothing wrong with South Florida. The people are warm and friendly while we're

[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:53.660]
added Bush was the greatest president ever Hitler was misunderstood. Now you can

[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:58.100]
come in idiot tell me to go away and Kathy can feel better about herself. Little

[00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:04.900]
sarcasm there from Baron Fitz about the South Florida scene. Oh boy. Here's the

[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:09.560]
poll. How many vote we got? 75 not too great. I don't think they care about the

[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:15.660]
polls anymore. They'll care about anything. Right? You think? No. G20 protest in London

[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:19.380]
they got thousands of protesters out there. We're getting all nervous and

[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:26.200]
jerky. The thing I hate most about living in South Florida is the effing

[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:32.540]
traffic 21. Unbearable heat from May to October 17. Cubans who won't speak English

[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:37.940]
in Elevator 9. David Samson and Luria steeling tax money from taxpayers to

[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:44.700]
build a stadium of seven. What is it? Root customer service at most doors and

[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:50.040]
restaurant seven criminal county commissioners and politicians seven cops pigs

[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:55.660]
who hide behind trees and stalk innocent civilians for and equated roads and

[00:59:55.660 --> 01:00:01.900]
transportation system to French Canadians and Hollywood beach to ask clowns who

[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:06.960]
talk during movies to but that could be anywhere not just South Florida. Right. Oh

[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:13.100]
I saw this before raster this is where he gets shot in the head and the rampant

[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:19.480]
crime in murders one. All far to drive way too slow one is not the traffic. Oh

[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:23.860]
well well that's just one element waiting online at restaurants none and also none

[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:28.000]
for pathetic sports franchises too many shopping walls and dirty bookstores and

[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.040]
sharing oxygen with H Wayne, Huyzenga 80 votes in those last four have none zero. The

[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:41.920]
big oh the big eight golden oh boy oldies jingles let's play all the jingles all

[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:53.700]
the time like Motown CKW Mokanshan from 77 W ABC go go go

[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:10.740]
the big eight golden 11 23 at 5 60 WQME those were the days man we're living in

[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:14.720]
the past the great days of radio especially AM radio the big 50,000 watt

[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:22.380]
giants with a big stick Ray who sends who sends good polls that I use every now

[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:27.820]
and then Ray obviously is hanging out with Kathy he says welcome back hope you're

[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:33.020]
feeling better I know that the name pull is over but I wanted to ask you about the

[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:37.000]
one George did not out of this poll because he never heard of him. No I'm sure

[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.020]
he never heard of him but seriously does the name get more manly than the first

[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:43.740]
commissioner baseball can I saw mountain landess that name just oozes test

[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:48.680]
a strong can I saw mountain landess you ever hear him it came up I thought it

[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:53.240]
was just a weird you know long name not necessarily cool and no I had never

[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.320]
heard of him and I didn't want to type that whole thing out so I said I forget

[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:00.660]
about it. We didn't want to type the whole thing out huh I agreed it's like

[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:04.160]
yeah what a lot of what we didn't want to type the whole thing out I don't blame

[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:10.260]
I wouldn't want to either yeah. How's he doing? Is he still Twittering? I don't know

[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:17.320]
you tell me I hope I have it here because I may have tossed it your salad I have

[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:23.940]
one of the most fun to czar what oh I bet you I tossed it oh no it was about

[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.020]
realize that I got a whole bunch of crap in here under the Abe Lincoln thing I keep

[01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:13.420]
thinking that the Abe Lincoln was a gay who cares about Abe Lincoln and his penis maybe

[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:19.780]
they want to date there's one one guy that I would never never think about his penis it's Abe Lincoln

[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:30.980]
oh my god him and Kim Bo camper yeah I got a whole pile of crap here well I'll probably need it

[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:36.840]
you know later on but I don't have that thing about the Twitter oh it made me kind of titter

[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:45.260]
when I wrote about the Twitter can you believe that I believe it but I do have the thing about

[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:50.680]
Jamaica man I'm gonna read that by Wayne Beeson who's a professional gay fact but nevertheless

[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:15.100]
it was second last week of the NFL season the dolphins were playing the chiefs I felt compelled

[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:19.340]
to send the email regarding the future announcing a Jimmy syphilis I am again compelled

[01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:24.240]
while hearing the radio broadcast of the dolphin game that day was a radio action now usually

[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:29.420]
watched on the cube I typically listen to Panther games on the radio as I'm driving home with

[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:33.960]
that time of night when the first periods being played now while I wasn't exactly a fan of Randy

[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:37.840]
Moher I never particularly turned off by him either I'd actually thought he was passable as an

[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:44.220]
ounce over the last few seasons my opinion is changed drastically earlier this year when the

[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:48.520]
panthers made a runner climb to the playoff picture Randy got far too excited to early in the

[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:53.180]
season he changed he thought himself too important he seemed like he went to the syphilis school

[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:58.480]
of over announcing now while there are no yardlines and hockey for Randy to misidentify has

[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:04.900]
delivered his deliveries become cephalo-esque he started overusing those gimmick phrases that you

[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.460]
most instantly pointed out are stolen anyway with seven ninety doing that thing where call

[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:12.780]
to suggest one of the use of songwants of a chemical goal Randy weeding out full of himself and

[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:16.100]
then that Miami herald article was written about him made his head just explode

[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:23.740]
the panther radio broadcasts become unlistenable it's the Randy Moher show he is god awful you can't

[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:27.760]
figure out what's happening in the game he just spouts colloquialisms and cliches instead of

[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.440]
giving play by play you need a Randy Moher to English dictionary just to understand the hockey

[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:37.040]
action for example couldn't stick the fork in it player took a shot and missed the net

[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:41.360]
worst of all he's only got about ten of these things so they repeated odd nauseam

[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.140]
here's a sampling of thirty seconds of action from last night

[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.960]
Krebs wins the battle in the circle and feeds the rubber to devour act devour

[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.700]
it's caught in the cookie jar and a puck goes over to the senators they move up the ice wall

[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:57.300]
a pass that was like frying bacon with no uh... shirt on the panthers retake possession

[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:02.580]
volmiss to winds up a can't stick the fork in it rebound to pelton and oh he can't stick a fork in it

[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:07.760]
the war i find it in sticks at top shelf right where Mrs. Moher keeps the peanut butter just horrid

[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.640]
says Kenny i've come to the conclusion that if you had Jimmy syphilis Randy Moher and Dave

[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.960]
Anne Horne together including the heat guy mucking this was actually a broadcaster

[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:20.280]
south-road is not only the worst sports announcing market america maybe also the worst sports

[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:24.340]
announcing market of all time to which i say amen hallelujah

[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.620]
top shelf where Mrs. Moher keeps the cookies stealing from rick jenner right you ought to be

[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:38.760]
horse whipped Randy a red deer Randy Moher you idiot horse whipped you ought to be flogged

[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.400]
yes that's right get out the whip

[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:48.260]
and all these idiots writing about stuff who it wouldn't know a hockey puck from a Mrs.

[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:53.120]
lenders bagel from out from a kinsh from a stale kinsh that was up 54 points

[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:57.300]
but then again since nobody cares about it what am i going to say and what's

[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:01.840]
they get excited Kenny nobody in south Florida knows about it or cares about it

[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:07.440]
david corals brings us i think the greatest moment in tv was when kedy kirk had a colonoscopy

[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.380]
i don't want to see the outside of it

[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:34.820]
oh and here's here's a guy with a long song to dance about actually medicine not no interest

[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:39.600]
anyway that spends the dime now we're in the past on this station we don't uh knock them

[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.860]

here's one i have listened to you on and off for years i've related to George more than you

[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:54.580]

[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:58.120]
he looks like a pedophile oh yeah what does a pedophile look like me

[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:03.780]
Neil please give him more ben and juries keep up the good works as alohandro

[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:36.020]

[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.460]
Stephen Alexander speaking of silly is another fake

[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:43.800]
probably your buddy john ztr are you bad-mouthing florida again i emailed you a couple of weeks ago

[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.520]
telling you how you don't get what florida's all about if you don't like florida that's fine but

[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:51.960]

[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:01.380]
thing maybe if you showed more appreciation for florida you would be recognized by us have you ever

[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:05.260]
thought why there isn't a neo-rodger's boulevard or a neo-rodger's pit stop on the turnpike

[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:08.680]
because you hate soft photo show the love kneel okay

[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:43.800]
don't see any apology here from your buddy rich pactyr jimmy dorsky says late last night i made

[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:48.060]
the regrettable mistake of visiting a 24 hour wall mart the only express how open was hijacked

[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:52.460]
by a miserable old bitch who exceeded the ten item limit by about four hundred when made

[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:56.260]
aware the complaints from the rest of the people in line lady turned them and said kiss my ass

[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:03.300]
well then great although people like that are one of the things i hate most about soft photo here's

[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:08.240]
an unlikely choice for the pool that would get my vote all the hot women why is that something

[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:12.680]
they hate because i can't have them that may be my problem but i know i'm not the only one frustrated

[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:16.460]
by the fact that it's impossible to go by a roll of paper towels without seeing at least ten hot

[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:22.900]
women who wouldn't give us guys the time of day good luck to us all says jimmy dorsky yeah that

[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:27.880]
should be your worst problem all the hot women really that was of seventy five points i guess

[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:35.300]
it's our fault that he can't get them here's one from johnny hello niel and george welcome back

[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:39.840]

[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:46.860]
off on sickly and have george do the show great show george thanks but no it says mind your

[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:50.260]
business on your full day about the cubans not speaking English in the elevator how about the

[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:56.060]
frogs presidians jews and russian's etc i've been defensive to cubans but there are not all

[01:13:56.060 --> 01:14:03.560]
Spanish speaker i'm i'm being defensive to cubans be in but there are not all spanish speaker

[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:08.580]
here in south florida's quite a mix as you know i'll recommend a change to other nationalities

[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:14.360]
other than english some people may maybe excuse because they're tourists visiting on vacation

[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:21.820]
or investing in town maybe says johnny who's i got obviously a literacy problem oh here we go jimmy

[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:26.580]
syphilis is back we had our meeting with steven or osd david murphy very butel niel gukus of the

[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:31.920]
dolphins the organization is set to make a format week a formal request a beastly group to move them

[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:37.720]
the team to one of beastlies fm stations preferably kiss the organization is dissatisfied with wqm's

[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:42.560]
weak signal and programming you're continued on air comments are not well received the organization

[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.820]
is well aware of the history and public relations fiasco you and phil henry caused a w-i-o-d

[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:52.680]
losing the dolphins to be a big blow to wqm i'd hate for my friends joe bell josh dero joe rose

[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:56.840]
demanded george corso and jim tree crawford you would be responsible for the stations demise

[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:07.600]
history repeats itself yeah that's funny that is amusing i'd be responsible for the stations demise

[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:12.540]
right oh god but here's one from rick riley

[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:20.840]
i'm ready at fake rick riley at live dot com gahat niel we know you know two topics never have never

[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:26.500]
will we know this but now what you're you're gonna die when you hear this i'm strapped in since

[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:30.040]
you stopped taking callers your show has turned into a private conversation between you and

[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:35.020]
george with little or no chance for us your audience to contribute if you're not planning to take

[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:38.700]
phone calls again fine but at least give us a chance to respond to something and i don't mean

[01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:43.540]
the stupid daily poll either talking of contributing to the show is there any chance george could go

[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:47.740]
back to just saying the odd word or phrase like he used to in the 90s he's really getting on my nerves

[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:53.440]
from the fake rick riley yeah just a private conversation the emails including the one i just read

[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:58.940]
they don't take it on the show they all get on there 99 percent even the one from the fake jimmy syphilis

[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:07.860]
jay steward not j randolph j steward i mean the idea of j randolph being the announcer on a

[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:13.560]
quiz show is so amusing but nevertheless Wayne Beeson writes jameka a killer vacation

[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:20.840]
do i have time for this yes this week i joined san francisco organizer michael patrellis and

[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:26.260]
box turtle bulletin editor jim burroway launching an international book hot against jameka while the

[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:30.880]
island appears laid back gaze are under attack forget business as usual instead we should stop doing

[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:35.440]
business with a country that is proud of its persecution against gay lesbian bisexual and transgender

[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:40.660]
people our goal is to turn jameka into a pariah state as long as the glbt people live in a state of

[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:45.360]
terror this means no more subsidizing the anti gay slaughter by drinking myrus rum and red stride beer

[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:49.560]
it requires skipping that carnival cruise to jameka so your money won't support murder

[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:53.760]
if jameka were any more homophobic it would change the name of its signature music reggae to

[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:59.880]
raced rate the national song would be wasting the gaze again in murder in murder readerville

[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:04.940]
why boycott because jameka is on a downward spiral and suffers from collective cultural

[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:09.580]
dementia on this issue there is clearly a pathological panic and homo hysteria that's infected

[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:14.840]
this nation at its core consider that the jameka cancer society is raised concerns that the fear

[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:19.180]
of being labeled gay is causing some jameka mendible void prostate examinations causing one of the

[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:23.760]
highest prostate cancer rates in the world the second reason to boycott is because traditional

[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.740]
activism is failed i first read about your make a terrific violence against gay people in a 2004

[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:35.140]
New York Times editorial called hated to death in jameka in 2006 time magazine had an article about

[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:40.300]
the island headline the most homophobic place on earth one would think that such chilling headlines

[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:44.760]
would have spurred worldwide action against jameka instead the climate is only deteriorated with

[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:49.240]
the two thousand eight New York Times article titled of tax show easygoing jameka is dire place for

[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:54.700]
gays a scathing state department report on jameka's treatment of homosexuals reads like a horror novel

[01:17:54.700 --> 01:18:00.700]
the jameka forum for lesbians all sexuals and gays jay flag continue to report human rights abuses

[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:06.280]
including arbitrary detention mob attacks stabbing harassment of homosexual patients by hospital

[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:11.360]
and prison staff and targeted shootings of homosexuals questioned by the bbc jameka's

[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:14.600]
prime minister Bruce golding said that he would not allow gay people to serve in his cabinet

[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.860]
in march 2009 he added we're not going to yield to the pressure whether that pressure comes from

[01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:22.260]
individual organizations individuals whether that pressure comes from foreign governments or

[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:27.880]
groups of countries to liberalize the losses relates to buggery a third reason for the boycott

[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:31.900]
is because we can have an impact in jameka the tropical islander in two point one billion dollars

[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:36.820]
from tourism in 2006 with over a million arrivals from the u.s clearly jameka is uniquely

[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:40.800]
vulnerable to economic pressure and thus every effort should be made to push for change

[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:44.840]
a fourth reason to boycott is that a message needs to be sent throughout the world

[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:48.560]
gay people will no longer sit by passively where our people are brutalized and killed

[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:53.340]
if we do not stop the hate in one place if we can jameka it will be continued to be open

[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:57.460]
season against gays all across the world there must be consequences for state sanctioned gay

[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:02.080]
bashing such countries will not change on their own so economic caretics and sticks must be applied

[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:07.300]
the current failed strategy is a treadmill diplomacy where we send off a few letters to embassies

[01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:11.740]
and hope things will magically improve it may feel like we're advancing but we really are at best

[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:16.640]
running in place this explains while news headlines about jameka's treatment of gay people in

[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:23.720]
2004 look like the terrifying ones in 2009 let me read that again this explains why the news

[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:27.820]
headlines about jameka's treatment of gay people in 2004 look remarkably like the terrifying ones

[01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:32.640]
in 2009 the choices ours we can be meek in the face of madness or we can take action

[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:37.940]
finally jameka is an island of self-righteous hypocrites the bible is used to rationalize brutality

people's leaky faucets i found the fake twitter thing this is good very confusing now this

[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:30.120]
confusing is Kathy's email earlier which by the way she never came here she's gone she's gone

[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:48.000]
we have a fake uh Facebook account and a fake twitter account and a real a my space account which

[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:54.040]
might as well forget it useless i believe you've said you're not using twitter and won't that's

[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:58.280]
correct so i must assume this is a fake page most likely created by a fake email or correct

[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:03.660]
now it's here here's where it gets interesting the fake neo-rodgers page counts among its real

[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:09.980]
subscribers the real five sixty wqa m the real flea five sixty a k a lee felman and mr. radio six

[01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:51.120]
many assumptions can be drawn from this data but i don't feel comfortable giving my analysis

[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:55.780]
just yet however i do think it's safe to say that none of these people have your best interests in

[01:34:55.780 --> 01:35:00.120]
mind straight lines can be drawn back and forth and only one degree of separation exists

[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:05.580]

cliff and candle says i had the misfortune of hearing the 940 wion's the official announcement

[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:40.140]
they were changing into an all sports format starting this Friday night whoopie

[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:45.640]
it was a bizarre tongue-in-cheek announcement that proclaimed they had successfully gotten

[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:49.700]
Barack Obama elected that their job was done now their new goal is to get the dolphins back

[01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:54.600]
into the super bowl good luck i'm not going to shed any tears over the demise of progressive

[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:59.140]
radio and south florida cliff says with the advent of smartphone technology most radio stations are

[01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:03.740]
easily acceptable via the internet which can be accessed through a smartphone or a dumb phone

[01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:10.140]
or a dumbbell smartphone technology is also rendered satellite radio obsolete so no matter how hard

[01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:14.540]
the right fingers try to shut down the progressive voice it just won't work you are the last progressive

[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:18.280]

[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:58.340]
long-time listeners sad okay we heard you talk on your show about taking the train from Berlin

[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:04.520]
to Rome abugare rape yeah that's where i went we would appreciate your comments on the trip i

[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:08.180]
never took the train from Berlin to Rome because you'd have to be a crazy person to do that

[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:13.140]
you have to go through all the mountains through the alps and all that crap it would take forever

[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:18.600]
i can't and my my it says how long did it take how much did it cost was it worth the time

[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:25.920]
well they could go online and check on your own rail and get and get the time exact times

[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:29.100]
when it leaves when it comes back when it gets there what it does

[01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:35.440]
take forever it's about an hour and a half or two hour flight if i recall correctly from

[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:40.700]
Berlin to Rome done it many times never took the train from Berlin to Rome i took the train from

[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:49.180]
Frankfurt to a cologne and back took the train from Amsterdam to cologne many times

[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:55.720]
but this business heard you talk on about taking the train from Berlin to Rome this is what gets me

[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:58.320]

[02:14:06.090 --> 02:14:13.690]
the wear of exploding balls for the reference that you ever use steroids human growth hormone or any

[02:14:13.690 --> 02:14:21.430]

I was young stupid no no the right sports agent and publicist can make a millionaire out of a dumb ass kid

[02:14:44.330 --> 02:14:48.710]
all you got to do is cheat if you're young and dumb

[02:14:50.610 --> 02:15:01.570]

[02:16:02.470 --> 02:16:07.610]
Adam well I think it's a perfect match says unless you run drugs like he is so what's wrong

[02:16:07.610 --> 02:16:14.050]

[02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:22.970]
got to trade out Jaguar I'm sure of it but not George and I take the blame for that's because

[02:17:22.970 --> 02:17:27.930]
you're on this show you're connected with me that's all right it's the double-edged sword when somebody

[02:17:27.930 --> 02:17:34.810]
drive these days how do you get to work my daughter's car really yeah and what does she think about that

[02:17:34.810 --> 02:17:41.550]
she doesn't like it I think your daughter ought to come out there and and the Pian Joe Bell's desk yeah

[02:17:41.550 --> 02:17:46.030]
sure she out of she I'm serious she had to climb up on his desk and take a big dump right in the

[02:17:46.030 --> 02:17:50.790]
middle of his desk say until you get my dad a car I'm gonna keep coming to every day and dump it

[02:17:50.790 --> 02:17:58.810]
all over you he might enjoy it though if I was you I keep my daughter away from Joe Bell that

[02:17:58.810 --> 02:18:04.330]
that's just a little piece of advice okay ironically in a conscious bid to read their computers with

[02:18:04.330 --> 02:18:09.090]
the dastardly April Fool's Day Conficker virus some people may have unwittingly installed it

[02:18:10.670 --> 02:18:14.930]
the Conficker C Internet Wormers and Militius Computer virus that burrows into your hard drive

[02:18:14.930 --> 02:18:20.550]
and we do to begin hatching its nefarious plans last night and midnight the virus was launched

[02:18:20.550 --> 02:18:26.190]
October 2008 and it since infected and estimated 12 million windows based PCs via unreliable websites

[02:18:26.190 --> 02:18:31.430]
and downloads as the virus moves into with second phase today gives an outside user control of a

[02:18:31.430 --> 02:18:36.030]
hijack machine and the sphere your private information could be stolen I got to open up this door

[02:18:36.450 --> 02:18:40.590]
or I'm gonna like pass down on the floor okay it is so hot and here you can breathe and

[02:18:40.590 --> 02:18:58.610]
find egg on the board okay only six percent of all infected computers are in North America

[02:18:59.470 --> 02:19:02.770]
while the majority 45 percent exist in Asia but with so much interest and

[02:19:02.770 --> 02:19:06.930]
Conficker in the Western world its creators have found a new viral marketing campaign to keep it alive

[02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:12.750]
software security vendor semantic publishers of the popular Norton anti virus released a report

[02:19:12.750 --> 02:19:17.270]
Tuesday that says people were more susceptible to download a copy of the virus simply by searching

[02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:24.270]
for Conficker in the Google oh geez that's how I got this article the search brings up 3.2

[02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:27.730]
million mentions of the worm on the internet some of them hoax websites and actually host

[02:19:27.730 --> 02:19:34.970]
the virus and infect any users who surf those sites be careful with the links you follow the

[02:19:34.970 --> 02:19:38.770]
company warned the news release a sincere effort of keeping abreast with latest security information

[02:19:38.770 --> 02:19:44.850]
might contain some unwelcome surprises the news doesn't come as a surprise to steward Crawford VP

[02:19:44.850 --> 02:19:49.450]
of Calgary IT firm bulletproof info tech the internet is a minefield and you have nowhere to step

[02:19:49.450 --> 02:19:55.430]
he said we'd like to remind people to only rely on trusted sites how do you like that okay

[02:19:55.950 --> 02:20:00.110]
the first real computer virus skewering years has also been attracting a cottage industry of

[02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:04.590]
online scam artists do be a cyber criminals who are selling alleged removal tools for the virus

[02:20:04.590 --> 02:20:11.370]
and promise a lot and do nothing some even infect the PC with more malware bad guys will try to

[02:20:11.370 --> 02:20:15.930]
take advantage of any crisis whether it's a national catastrophe or Conficker's striking said John

[02:20:15.930 --> 02:20:22.350]
a cock associate professor in the computer science department at the University of Calgary that's

[02:20:22.350 --> 02:20:32.970]
name yeah sure so and so in that respect this is surprising the computer is infected with

[02:20:32.970 --> 02:20:36.270]
Conficker a schedule to move into a new face today April one when the worm will seek new

[02:20:36.270 --> 02:20:40.230]
instructions what those instructions are has been relatively unknown to leading computer experts

[02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:44.530]
in a worst case scenario the worm can take over your machine and steal out your personal data

[02:20:44.530 --> 02:20:48.290]
on the other hand I have to say this could all be one of the most elaborate April fools they hoaxes

[02:20:48.290 --> 02:20:53.650]
ever we don't know what those instructions are and in all likelihood nothing is going to happen

[02:20:53.650 --> 02:20:58.270]
a cox said the worm when it's been difficult to identify and remove has been one of the most

[02:20:58.270 --> 02:21:02.010]
sophisticated and potentially dangerous that many in the information security business of

[02:21:02.010 --> 02:21:07.410]
Enkos on and on what is wrong with you man what is your problem

[02:21:13.230 --> 02:21:18.150]

[02:27:32.950 --> 02:27:37.450]
air from time to time as I mentioned I'm in London one of the cameraman told me he was in

[02:27:37.450 --> 02:27:41.390]

[02:28:48.990 --> 02:28:56.270]
real dirt everything in South Florida is sugar sand well what does that mean sugar sand I don't

[02:28:56.270 --> 02:29:02.210]

[02:29:27.950 --> 02:29:33.350]
but you'll have to wait till a print's out okay so what about that configure thing I I think it's

[02:29:33.350 --> 02:29:41.610]
an April fools joke they said it's not it's not what a joke but I'm not doing anything differently

[02:29:43.310 --> 02:29:48.630]

[02:29:48.630 --> 02:29:57.390]
computers are crashing all over the world yeah there oh no there goes one no oh I think it's

[02:29:57.390 --> 02:30:02.410]
another April fool soaks but nevertheless I'm just a skeptic you know me I don't believe in anything

[02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:08.050]
the thousand eighty four points I believe that because I see it on my screen and guess what they

[02:30:08.050 --> 02:30:12.190]
must have been listening to me because they finally improve the size of the numbers there in

[02:30:12.190 --> 02:30:17.850]
a bottom right hand corner not always though now they're back to the little teeny tiny green ones

[02:30:17.850 --> 02:30:27.550]
that you can't read they are evil CNN is evil not as evil as CNBC but evil a cannibal mom

[02:30:27.550 --> 02:30:32.430]
exed friend of death cooked her body in eighth and meat while the killers young son looked on

[02:31:38.650 --> 02:31:45.030]
a crazy stuff oh here's some stuff from Monday because I was out sick yesterday so I'm backed up

[02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:50.590]
here so to speak there's things you can take for that and my ears are plugged up so that I could

[02:31:50.590 --> 02:31:55.010]
add somebody break in here and I wouldn't have done it because when Paco came in there to use my

[02:31:55.010 --> 02:31:59.870]
shower because it's how water shut off I I told I heard something but in an ordinarily I would hear

[02:31:59.870 --> 02:32:03.150]
you know as soon as as soon as the key would turn to the door I would like run and see what that

[02:32:03.150 --> 02:32:09.410]
was going on you know I'm saying in case of a home invader we're right it could have been a boogie man

[02:32:09.930 --> 02:32:16.930]
it was only Paco here's one from somebody it says Haney was at the heat game Monday night during

[02:32:16.930 --> 02:32:21.590]
halftime he had a ceremony honoring Alonzo morning governor Chris was an ounce and called on the

[02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:26.970]
speaking he was booed loudly for three minutes I guess most thought South Lovidians truly left

[02:32:26.970 --> 02:32:31.290]
their sister governor know how they feel about him both as a man and as a governor they should have

[02:32:31.290 --> 02:32:38.050]
an yelling you fairy a Charlie gay he's sure full in some people one or two

[02:32:39.490 --> 02:32:44.190]
must be full in the republicans I guess oh yeah they don't care oh we want Charlie Chris to be the

[02:32:44.190 --> 02:32:47.650]
running mate for John McCain because we need some fruit cake on there you know

[02:32:51.290 --> 02:32:55.990]
this is good from Tampa if you ever need an example why drinking and dialing is not a joke

[02:32:55.990 --> 02:32:59.650]
you'll leave the serious repercussions consider the case of Ivan Cavitt

[02:33:02.130 --> 02:33:09.830]
darkly the her name is spelled EVO in Ivan okay well maybe it's one of those names you know I don't

[02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:17.010]
know maybe it's seven EVO in I think it's supposed to be YV O N N E like Ivan de Carlo but maybe

[02:33:17.010 --> 02:33:24.150]
misspelled you catch my drift yep Tampa police say she was the woman who misused the 9-11 system

[02:33:24.150 --> 02:33:28.490]
Wednesday last week calling three times and tell the dispatchers that a roommate was trying to

[02:33:28.490 --> 02:33:35.490]
take beer away from her here's a partial transcript of 9-11 calls released by the Tampa police

[02:33:35.490 --> 02:33:41.110]
department the spatcher what's the problem right now Cavitt domestic violence the spatcher what's

[02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:49.710]
going I can't read all this goes on forever good don't there's an argument on going out of control

[02:33:49.710 --> 02:33:53.990]
what are you arguing about beer I'm totally embarrassed even to say that but yeah it's about beer

[02:33:54.890 --> 02:33:58.590]
a few minutes later Cavitt then tells the dispatcher who roommates try to take a beer away

[02:33:58.590 --> 02:34:03.970]
and actually a police can be sent to her apartment at 712 East Florida Brasca Avenue officers

[02:34:03.970 --> 02:34:08.150]
went to the apartment about 2.35 Wednesday morning found Cavitt drinking from a 40-ounce bottle

[02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:14.570]
of Bud Light an unidentified man sitting with her Cavitt police told police she had drank 6-6-60

[02:34:14.570 --> 02:34:20.650]
ounce cans of beer but wasn't finished drinking she told officers she didn't call 9-11 although

[02:34:20.650 --> 02:34:24.750]
her home phone number maxed the ID from the 9-11 center she then said she'd called about some

[02:34:24.750 --> 02:34:29.490]
kids selling drugs outside police said the man with her pointed at her mind a drinking motion

[02:34:29.490 --> 02:34:34.150]
and then mind holding a phone receiver the officer sold her the 9-11 system is for emergencies only

[02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:40.070]
and left then of course there was a second call two cops just came to my apartment for no reason

[02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:46.890]
Cavitt said nobody called them out here and that goes on and on she's a crazy person

[02:34:46.890 --> 02:34:51.670]
what what what what what like that she was arrested and charged with three misdemeanors misused

[02:34:51.670 --> 02:34:58.530]
the 9-11 system of striking the office without violence and disorderly conduct and she posted

[02:34:58.530 --> 02:35:03.170]
$1,250 bailed to get out how do you like that bitch huh well she's got to she's got to have

[02:36:29.390 --> 02:36:34.470]
two hundred ninety one votes on the poll the thing I hate most about living in South Florida the

[02:36:34.470 --> 02:36:40.110]
unbearable heat from eight of october's taken lead 61 the effing traffic 59 close second

[02:36:41.130 --> 02:36:45.350]
don't live there no more 39 never live there's six

[02:36:47.770 --> 02:36:52.010]
is that a feather in our crap the fact that we have people who never even lived in South Florida

[02:36:52.010 --> 02:36:55.050]
to listen to the show. Yes it is. Online. Yes it is.

[02:37:00.890 --> 02:37:03.610]
What in God's name is this? Rich in Orlando.

[02:37:09.590 --> 02:37:12.790]
Oh, remember the poll we did on the best voice, the most

[02:37:12.790 --> 02:37:14.650]
most identifiable voice. Yeah.

[02:37:16.730 --> 02:37:20.030]
This is from last Thursday to show you how deep in my pile, I'm

[02:37:20.030 --> 02:37:22.750]
getting deep. This is another great poll, but this could have

[02:37:22.750 --> 02:37:26.390]
been split into three separate polls, most identifiable, most

[02:37:26.390 --> 02:37:28.190]
distinguished and best voice over artist.

[02:37:31.250 --> 02:37:34.670]
I mean, again, somebody taking something very simple and

[02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:38.570]
making it very complicated. They're not satisfied with the

[02:37:38.570 --> 02:37:40.690]
fact that we just put the poll up there and it is what it is

[02:37:40.690 --> 02:37:44.190]
and that's what it's towards that. And then that's it. Oh, it

[02:37:44.190 --> 02:37:45.870]
could have been this and it should have been that and blah, blah,

[02:37:45.870 --> 02:37:47.690]
blah, blah, blah, blah. You know, right.

[02:37:48.930 --> 02:37:51.870]
Thrown with people. Everything's got to be movie

[02:37:51.870 --> 02:37:56.970]
complicated, whatever that means. Is that how you said? I don't

[02:37:56.970 --> 02:37:59.890]
know. Sure. Sounds good to me. That's what I'm going to

[02:37:59.890 --> 02:38:06.570]
do. Oh, bad huh? There's good. I've got no carbs. I had

[02:38:06.570 --> 02:38:12.150]
enough candy yesterday to sink a battleship. Is that depressing?

[02:38:12.910 --> 02:38:14.890]
It's, yeah, it is. I did.

[02:38:17.390 --> 02:38:20.150]
Well, I discovered a new candy, which you give. If you give

[02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:22.110]
me a second, I'll go in the waist-past in the other room

[02:38:22.110 --> 02:38:25.770]
and tell you what it is. Go ahead. Okay. Give me a second.

[02:38:47.710 --> 02:38:52.190]
The last thing I needed to do was find a new candy, right? Maynards,

[02:38:52.470 --> 02:38:58.650]
Sour Cherry Blasters. Oh, made with real fruit juice. Well,

[02:38:58.650 --> 02:39:02.390]
that makes it healthy. They're a little like disc like round,

[02:39:03.790 --> 02:39:09.570]
like gummy thing, you know, okay. Oh, they're just awesome.

[02:39:14.330 --> 02:39:18.670]
It says true like no one's watching. Oh, what is that?

[02:39:18.730 --> 02:39:27.850]
I don't know. And I enjoyed it so much. I had one bag yesterday.

[02:39:29.890 --> 02:39:32.430]
Afternoon. And last night I went back over to the no speaking

[02:39:32.430 --> 02:39:34.950]
of this Chinese market. I got three more bags of it, three bags.

[02:39:35.390 --> 02:39:40.830]
And I ate the whole thing. Wow. Do you have any idea how much

[02:39:40.830 --> 02:39:44.650]
sugar we're talking about? A lot to fill up enough to fill up the state of Alaska.

[02:39:48.690 --> 02:39:51.510]
I have to fill up Joe Bells. Brackum. Fat ass.

[02:39:51.630 --> 02:39:55.350]
Oh, Maynards Sour Cherry Blasters. Probably a Canadian thing,

[02:39:55.390 --> 02:40:01.870]
eh? Let me see where it's made. Yep. Toronto, Ontario, made by

[02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:07.330]
Cadbury Adams. They are awesome. They're like cherry flavor.

[02:40:07.570 --> 02:40:09.570]
I don't know if they come into. Yeah, these are sour cherry

[02:40:09.570 --> 02:40:11.390]
blasters. So I guess they would be cherry flavor.

[02:40:11.670 --> 02:40:14.450]
I know. Yeah. What a genius. So they're sour. I'm smart.

[02:40:15.410 --> 02:40:18.770]
What are they sour? Yeah, they're sour and delicious.

[02:40:18.930 --> 02:40:22.190]
I like sour candy. Do you? Yeah. It's sour.

[02:40:22.350 --> 02:40:25.090]
Well, the sun is coming out. It's going to be 50 to day 56 tomorrow.

[02:40:25.670 --> 02:40:26.030]
Hallelujah.

[02:40:32.830 --> 02:40:35.730]
Somebody sent me this. I'm sure you know this since you live in Toronto.

[02:40:35.730 --> 02:40:38.210]
Says Blackie. No, I don't know it.

[02:40:38.670 --> 02:40:42.970]
Pre-Agent Center Christian Hanson has cited two year level entry level

[02:40:42.970 --> 02:40:45.510]
contract for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Whoopie do big deal.

[02:40:46.430 --> 02:40:48.950]
And these people keep paying the big bucks four years in a row.

[02:40:49.010 --> 02:40:52.110]
They missed the playoffs four years in a row. I think that's the first time in

[02:40:52.110 --> 02:40:54.710]
history of the franchise. They were Mr. playoffs four years in a row.

[02:40:55.970 --> 02:40:57.710]
And I'm supposed to get excited about that.

[02:41:00.070 --> 02:41:03.330]
It's almost enough to make me turn on Leafs TV and put a little bit of that crap

[02:41:09.270 --> 02:41:09.750]
on here.

[02:41:13.370 --> 02:41:17.730]
Oh, they're helping Clark yell my coffee ice. There's another guy couldn't play.

[02:41:20.530 --> 02:41:23.990]
That looks like Alexander Mojone. It is.

[02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:27.710]
That's one of my all-time favorite players. Now he could play.

[02:41:27.810 --> 02:41:30.090]
There was a guy. Whiskey.

[02:41:30.090 --> 02:41:32.110]
He's not looking to wait to see what happened here.

[02:41:35.290 --> 02:41:38.450]
He only pulls the stakes from underneath. Rollinick.

[02:41:39.150 --> 02:41:41.930]
Rollinick. And Rollinick Sticker was the skate team up.

[02:41:42.350 --> 02:41:44.930]
Sticker came up. Stick came up and hit him right under the chin.

[02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:48.570]
Oh, right in the push. Oh, poor Alex. He's all right. He's okay though.

[02:41:48.750 --> 02:41:49.990]
It was an accident and somebody got hurt.

[02:41:50.250 --> 02:41:50.570]
Okay.

[02:41:51.630 --> 02:41:53.750]
See, somebody tried to throw me off my opponent rounds.

[02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:57.210]
Give me into a whole hockey thing there. Nobody in this town cares about hockey.

[02:41:57.210 --> 02:41:58.530]
You better get it.

[02:41:59.030 --> 02:42:05.190]
I woke up on Saturday morning since Paul with the self-hating Jew pole still on my mind.

[02:42:05.710 --> 02:42:07.490]
Pathetic, he says. He says Pathetic.

[02:42:08.310 --> 02:42:11.510]
But I thought of the definitive self-hating Jew, Jesus Christ.

[02:42:12.090 --> 02:42:13.050]
How do you like that?

[02:42:14.290 --> 02:42:14.630]
RR.

[02:42:15.390 --> 02:42:18.130]
Well, RR what? RR Kelly? Yeah.

[02:42:19.750 --> 02:42:22.110]
He already sent me that once before and I didn't use it.

[02:42:22.130 --> 02:42:25.370]
So he sent me again. And I used it this time. He's generally a pretty good guy.

[02:42:25.370 --> 02:42:28.190]
Paul. Paul Rodriguez, probably kind of George.

[02:42:28.450 --> 02:42:28.690]
Probably.

[02:42:29.790 --> 02:42:32.510]
All you Rodriguez guys, all you guys are related.

[02:42:32.790 --> 02:42:33.650]
Yep, we're a Keon.

[02:42:34.290 --> 02:42:37.410]
All part of God's family, baby. And they're Stephen Harper who is not.

[02:42:37.550 --> 02:42:38.430]
He's the anti-Christ.

[02:42:38.770 --> 02:42:39.530]
Oh, Neil.

[02:42:39.770 --> 02:42:41.110]
You're listening to Neil Rogers.

[02:42:41.690 --> 02:42:42.690]
In my home.

[02:42:43.570 --> 02:42:45.950]
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps.

[02:42:46.670 --> 02:42:48.590]
Where my children come and play with their toys.

[02:42:57.890 --> 02:42:59.670]
Good morning, reaching to the hotel.

[02:42:59.910 --> 02:43:01.410]
Yeah, room 521, please.

[02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:02.270]
521?

[02:43:02.830 --> 02:43:03.710]
521, please.

[02:43:03.870 --> 02:43:04.730]
Name it a gift you call it.

[02:43:05.150 --> 02:43:06.810]
Ah, that's none of your damn business.

[02:43:07.250 --> 02:43:07.610]
Thank you.

[02:43:07.810 --> 02:43:08.070]
Thank you.

[02:43:13.470 --> 02:43:13.910]
Hello.

[02:43:14.690 --> 02:43:16.190]
Ah, yeah, it's the gift.

[02:43:17.130 --> 02:43:17.490]
Who?

[02:43:17.970 --> 02:43:18.310]
The gift.

[02:43:19.030 --> 02:43:19.830]
Hello, Jeff.

[02:43:20.930 --> 02:43:21.810]
The gift.

[02:43:22.410 --> 02:43:24.490]
Only two. He mothers choose Jeff.

[02:43:24.490 --> 02:43:26.090]
Yes, or death.

[02:43:26.510 --> 02:43:27.730]
Oh, thank you, bird.

[02:43:27.890 --> 02:43:30.530]
I thought you were going to use a code name.

[02:43:31.330 --> 02:43:32.310]
Is it already?

[02:43:33.390 --> 02:43:33.650]
What?

[02:43:34.050 --> 02:43:35.310]
Jeep is the room ready.

[02:43:36.750 --> 02:43:37.950]
Oh, absolutely.

[02:43:38.890 --> 02:43:42.590]
I've left a sack of quarters in the bathroom for the Viper bed.

[02:43:43.170 --> 02:43:46.310]
And the edible pennies are in the sock drawer.

[02:43:46.710 --> 02:43:47.550]
Good, have it the champagne.

[02:43:48.030 --> 02:43:51.610]
The champagne is topped and ready for consumption.

[02:43:51.610 --> 02:43:56.490]
And the tube on the table with no label is the love jelly.

[02:43:57.470 --> 02:44:00.230]
I also read a copy of Pretty Woman for you

[02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:03.710]
in order to play any of oysters from room surveys.

[02:44:04.010 --> 02:44:04.550]
Beautiful.

[02:44:04.870 --> 02:44:07.050]
Your vitamin e-pills are on the dresser.

[02:44:07.430 --> 02:44:09.810]
Next to your nitro glycerin tablets.

[02:44:10.510 --> 02:44:14.810]
The room is ready for a little fuzure daddy.

[02:44:15.890 --> 02:44:16.670]
Great, sounds good.

[02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:19.330]
Oh, Frank, yeah, hold it.

[02:44:26.350 --> 02:44:30.710]
I'm going to help you out with this.

[02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:33.410]
But what if Cavie Lee finds out?

[02:44:33.550 --> 02:44:34.250]
I don't really think.

[02:44:34.450 --> 02:44:35.870]
Don't mention my name.

[02:44:36.130 --> 02:44:37.430]
I want nothing to do with it.

[02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:39.530]
This is the count of him.

[02:44:39.670 --> 02:44:42.910]
The globe will get a hold of and just have a field day with.

[02:44:43.110 --> 02:44:44.230]
Don't forget your name.

[02:44:44.390 --> 02:44:47.410]
I'm getting out of here now because the heat is getting hotter.

[02:44:47.690 --> 02:44:48.190]
That's good.

[02:44:49.330 --> 02:44:50.890]
Good bye, girl.

[02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:52.270]
Yeah, good bye, I'll see you soon.

[02:44:52.390 --> 02:44:53.190]
Bye, bye, bye.
