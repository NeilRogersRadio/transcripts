[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.680]
560.

[00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.580]
Just ain't over that far.

[00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.580]
By the way, just ain't no Roger show.

[00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.340]
To talk to Neil, dial 56070560 in date and broard.

[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.720]
In other counties, call toll free 8777.

[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.060]
What's your name?

[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.420]
They were not dealers today.

[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.520]
4.560 on your AT&T and Verizon wireless phones.

[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.760]
The opinions expressed by Neil, his guests or his colleagues, do not represent those of

[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.260]
WQAM management staff or sponsors.

[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.740]
A no-no-neil Roger show on 560WQAM.

[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.140]
It's Friday, you bastard.

[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.040]
Well, now it's time to panic.

[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.940]
After inauguration day, push his back and proper.

[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.120]
There's no one left to blame.

[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.440]
He might break in, but promises he made along the way.

[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.960]
Hopefully don't screw up everything in his first 100 days.

[00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.160]
For his first 100 days, mine really suck.

[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.360]
The banks and not all makers all want a trillion bucks.

[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.460]
He's been looking for the bathroom in the White House half the day.

[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.060]
He already missed his Chicago in his first 100 days.

[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.120]
His first 100 days, he's got some thank you cards to write.

[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.160]
Tresco, father, flager and Reverend Jeremiah Wright.

[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.020]
Chances are his mom and all will be driving him insane.

[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.060]
Because she doesn't man, I'll really be amazed.

[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.220]
And his first 100 days.

[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.020]
All right, 10-1 at 560WQAM.

[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.900]
Happy Friday the 13th.

[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.740]
Wow.

[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.640]
Oh, and here's a picture of the Miami Skyline, but the rest of the little blurb didn't come out.

[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.760]
Oh, geez.

[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.040]
Forbes magazine rates Miami as the ninth most miserable city in the USA.

[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.680]
What are you turtling about?

[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.780]
You're such a turtler.

[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.000]
Sorry, I think that's funny.

[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.600]
You always act like he swallowed the cat or something, swallowed a canary.

[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:20.180]
Miami's been crushed by the housing collapse, Moody's economy.com estimates 25% of mortgages in Miami are delinquent or likely to be written off as bad debt.

[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.980]
That can't be collected.

[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.800]
Violent crime, no way to win.

[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.760]
It just changed to St. Louis number 10.

[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.780]
I'll go back to it.

[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.300]
Violent crime and corruption are also off the charts.

[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:44.100]
Yeah, corruption like that statement they want to spend $750 million taxpayer money to build for a couple of rich spoiled A-holes while the teachers are getting the screw job.

[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.760]
Elie Ann was handed in, of course, as always.

[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.580]
Oh, geez.

[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.560]
You're picking that out.

[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.620]
She's such an idiot.

[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.100]
Oh, Rafi, you're so wonderful, Rafi.

[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.420]
Yeah.

[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.160]
She ain't saying so wonderful now that all these guys are turned out to be a bunch of roids, roid pumpers.

[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.020]
Now she's got her, she's mum about that.

[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.000]
She's busy arguing with Forbes magazine.

[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.680]
A Florida congresswoman is calling out Forbes magazine for including my men.

[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.200]
It's listed the 10 most miserable cities in the country, miserable.

[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.820]
So while you people that keep sending me all that proper gander about, oh, Brickle is this and, yeah, go ahead.

[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.680]
Have a good time there.

[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.820]
Misurable.

[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.640]
The publication ranked major metro areas on nine factors including commute times and employment or weather.

[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.360]
It docked Miami for its level of violent crime and corruption and said the city has been crushed by the housing collapse.

[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.160]
Not just harmed, not just wounded, crushed.

[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.740]
Yep.

[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.160]
Yeah, I wonder.

[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.800]
I mean, this sounds very insensitive.

[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.680]
It's terrible because it's a real tragedy that plane crash near Buffalo last night.

[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.400]
But if you were flying to Buffalo, what would you be better off landing or dying in a plane crash?

[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.380]
Ooh.

[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.840]
That's bad.

[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.500]
Well, that's just the way I look at it.

[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.080]
First of all, I wouldn't be flying to Buffalo.

[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.820]
I wouldn't be driving to Buffalo.

[00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.900]
I wouldn't be going to Buffalo.

[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.580]
I don't want to be.

[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.140]
I'm fairly close to Buffalo.

[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.560]
That was close as I ever want to be.

[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.140]
You don't be shuffling off anytime soon.

[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.060]
Now, will I be shuffling off to Buffalo or even Buffalo Raceway in Hamburg, New York?

[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.600]
US representative Ilyana Rosanna Dana said editors accepted confusing statistics as opposed to actually visiting,

[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.640]
getting a feel of our tropical paradise.

[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.920]
It's bozos like you, Ilyana, that make Miami what it is today.

[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.800]
It's imbaciles like you, you crazy old bitch.

[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.960]
In a statement yesterday, she cited South Florida's beaches, art festivals and cultural diversity,

[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.680]
making a case against the number nine ranking.

[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.960]
Well, I'm sure that they're going to listen to you in a Forbes magazine.

[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.560]
Ilyana, with your tremendous credibility.

[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.080]
Bleh, bleh.

[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.560]
She is a big part of what's wrong in that town.

[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.380]
Ilyana, she's a big part of it.

[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.300]
She symbolizes it.

[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.440]
Anyway, here's the list.

[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.940]
Stockton, California is the number one most miserable city in the country.

[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.980]
All of these top ten I can go along with except number three.

[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.360]
Number two Memphis, Tennessee.

[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.620]
Who the hell would want to be there?

[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.640]
Number three, shocking to me, Chicago.

[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.820]
What?

[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.840]
Yeah.

[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.580]
Now, let me, let me read to you.

[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.140]
Let me go back to this thing.

[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.120]
Okay, if I can find it.

[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.460]
I have to back up.

[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.000]
There's Miami.

[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.140]
There's Buffalo is number eight.

[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.380]
Oh, should be hard. Detroit seven.

[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.820]
What a bunch of losing towns on this list.

[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.520]
Flint, Michigan number six.

[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.560]
Modesto, California five.

[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.400]
Number four Cleveland.

[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.560]
Oh, amen to that.

[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.980]
A Chicago living cost in the second city are not much higher than the national average.

[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.520]
But the 10.3 percent sales tax is a killer and the highest of any city.

[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.140]
A winning Olympic pitch should move along needed transportation infrastructure improvements.

[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.240]
That's all it says.

[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.940]
Doesn't tell us why they think Chicago was great.

[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.840]
Yeah, that's awesome.

[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.100]
But I haven't been there in a long time though.

[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.560]
Anyway, Stockton, California, Memphis, Chicago, Cleveland, four, Modesto, California five.

[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.620]
Flint, Michigan six.

[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.200]
Just ask Michael Moore, he'll tell you seven Detroit.

[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.200]
Oh, you don't want to go there eight Buffalo.

[00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.420]
You definitely don't want to go there nine Miami and 10 St. Louis.

[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.320]
What a list.

[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.680]

[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.180]
And Elliott is all upset.

[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.160]
Oh, geez.

[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.400]
They're picking others again.

[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.420]
Yeah, because of simple things like you, bitch.

[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.900]
You're one of the reasons they're picking on Miami.

[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.380]
How can anybody could vote and put you in office?

[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.780]
Serious, by the way, was down to six cents this morning, not spec up to eight.

[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.720]
It's definitely a selling opportunity at eight cents.

[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.880]
That's what Flea said.

[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.980]
Flea also said Gary Sarner's a putts.

[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.200]
Yep.

[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.440]
And doesn't see that how fast he responded that he's not worried.

[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.220]
I'm not dragging him out of the closet on this one.

[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.540]
Gary Sarner, who was our national sales manager,

[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.320]
and just recently got demoted to just regular ordinary flunky order taker,

[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.580]
which is what he's been all this time anyway.

[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.560]
Oh, I don't do copy.

[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.540]
I don't do copy.

[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.900]
I just, yeah, that's right.

[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.900]
Idiot.

[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.940]
Yep.

[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.680]
And you know, let's just, now let's find out about your deal right off the bat.

[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.920]
So I don't forget about it.

[00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.220]
All right.

[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.040]
By the way, before that, today is picked up ony day at Gulf Stream.

[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.600]
Art is our contestant.

[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.780]
We don't use people's last names.

[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.040]
I don't know why, but that's all right.

[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.940]
I don't want his last name.

[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.140]
And my pick in the second race today, collaborative number four.

[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.360]
I like that Italian name.

[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.160]
Is that in the jockey?

[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.840]
Was it what?

[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.500]
Is that the chalk?

[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.200]
No, it will not be.

[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.300]
It's five to one in the morning line.

[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.720]
It's not going to be a big price though.

[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.920]
I think it's going to get that down.

[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.460]
It was claimed in the last start and had an excuse finished third kissing code,

[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.920]
which is the five horse in this race finished second in the same race.

[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.040]
But collaborative had an excuse steady in the back stretch.

[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.540]
And that was only five and a half for long.

[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.580]
This is six and a half.

[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.200]
So we'll see.

[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.260]
Second time, Lasex.

[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.040]
You've done well.

[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.560]
You've done well.

[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.660]
I've had two hundred and three starts both by a head though.

[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.960]
Very too close for comfort.

[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:45.560]
I don't like that.

[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.120]
Much too close.

[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.760]
Now can we start out this morning with a very, very hostile and negative email,

[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.320]
which I'm sure is a fake, but nevertheless could be real.

[00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:02.980]
It's probably a John ZTR or whatever his name is, because he also sent me a link to some interview with the Joaquin Phoenix from Letterman.

[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:03.700]
I'm not going to.

[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:04.720]
You think I'm going to watch that?

[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.640]
I watch that.

[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.360]
And he's either a really good actor or he's really high on drugs, one of the other.

[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.420]
Wow, what do you do?

[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.240]
He just seems very out of it and like mumbles and seems like he's really high.

[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.260]
Yeah, but why do I care about Joaquin Phoenix?

[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.000]
I don't know.

[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.600]
I don't.

[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.100]
Marisa Thomas at Big Booty Marisa at the something else.

[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.500]
Now see the email address.

[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.460]
I didn't see in the beginning.

[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.020]
That should be a little bit of a tip off at Big Booty Marisa.

[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.480]
Right.

[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.780]
Well, it could be real.

[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.140]
Sure.

[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:39.040]
You listen to it and see if you think it's real or make believe if it's just another Ojrampravakator stirring the pot.

[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.180]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.260]
I just wanted to say that I respect you.

[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.580]
I admire that you've been radio so long and is still on top.

[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.340]
I also admire you for coming out on the air and all that stuff you did when nobody had the guts to do it.

[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.020]
Now while I listen to your show, the real reason that I listen is because of George.

[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.240]
It's not a knock against you, but as a woman in my 20s, it's hard to get the humor from your generation.

[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.240]
George is more my generation as he was born after the 1970s.

[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.700]
When you joke around, I don't get it.

[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.040]
I've said they're trying to analyze to see if it's funnier if I just don't get it.

[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.060]
With George, that never happens.

[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:10.760]
I get the jokes.

[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.340]
There isn't a generational gap like there is with you.

[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.360]
It's like you're talking to me in Chinese, but I only speak English.

[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.100]
No speaking English.

[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.800]
When I listen to George, I feel invigorated.

[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.880]
With you, it's the opposite.

[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.440]
I feel like someone must feel after they get into a car crash.

[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.060]
The show ends and I feel disoriented and keep asking myself, what was that?

[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.120]
What was that?

[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.580]
Oh, gee, I'm so sorry, Maurice.

[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.160]
Not.

[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.960]
When you announced last year that you renewed your contract for another five years,

[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.500]
I was devastated because I was really looking forward to George getting his own show.

[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.040]
Please pass this on to George.

[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.340]
I love his show and he's awesome.

[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.660]
I'm just tired of all these George haters recently.

[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.820]
I wanted to balance it out.

[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.360]
Right.

[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.340]
Maurice said, obviously, a fake or one of the nastiest bitches ever come down to play.

[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.580]
I mean, you club George, right?

[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.820]
You want George's fine, you know?

[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.440]
But first of all, if I did retire, do you think they're going to give George the show

[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.400]
as anybody believe that?

[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.160]
What do you think?

[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.060]
Maybe.

[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.260]
You really believe that?

[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.280]
Yeah, I think it's a maybe.

[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:05.600]
Wow.

[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.280]
And of course, this is Flea who's got the boss's rear to his ear.

[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.200]
Oh, I can only imagine what that sounds like.

[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.040]
Oh, yeah, it's not pretty.

[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:14.600]
Oh, you know?

[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:15.420]
Yeah.

[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.180]
Yeah, Flea knows what it sounds when he's got his ear to the boss's rear.

[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.160]
In other words, back home.

[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:22.480]
Right.

[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.560]
With you, I feel like someone must feel after they get into a car crash.

[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.620]
Thanks Maurice, if you're for real, which I doubt.

[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:37.660]
But if it's in this slight case that you might be, for honest to go this person, you are one...

[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.420]
Well, stupid, I think is the word I'm looking for.

[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.000]
Really stupid.

[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:40.780]
Yeah.

[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.700]
She doesn't get it.

[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.820]
She doesn't understand my humor.

[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.580]
See, one thing about George and George is fine in his own way.

[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.660]
But George is not funny.

[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.180]
You know what I mean by that?

[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:55.600]
He's not funny.

[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.040]
Right.

[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:57.780]
Well, he's funny looking.

[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.840]
But I mean, he's not funny on the ear.

[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.780]
We've all agreed about that.

[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.940]
Now, you think George is funny?

[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.400]
He has a good sarcastic wit.

[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.720]
No, that wasn't what I asked.

[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.040]
He's George funny on the ear.

[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:10.940]
No, I wouldn't call him funny.

[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:11.900]
Oh, okay.

[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.560]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.480]
But Mauricea, she gets his sense of humor and she loves it.

[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.560]
One major flaw though.

[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.480]
George is not born in the 70s.

[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.620]
No, he was born in the 60s.

[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:25.940]
Correct.

[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.260]
I think she said in the beginning of the letter.

[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.520]
Oh, she doesn't know her ass from your elbow, okay?

[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.080]
Mauricea, my ass.

[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.620]
Mauricea, what was the email again?

[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:36.900]
Bigboodymyass.com.

[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.860]
Something like that, I don't know.

[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.060]
Bigboody, yeah, that's John's ETR guaranteed.

[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.840]
Just like that other one with the big boobs that he made up with the grotesque pictures.

[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.840]
Can't wait to see some pictures of Mauricea.

[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:51.840]
Dumber than sawdust.

[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.140]
Oh, well, when you say, I just don't get it.

[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.700]
I said, here, wondering, did I miss something?

[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.200]
Yeah, you missed out on life, honey.

[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.320]
You missed out.

[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.480]
Yeah, my humor is very esoteric and very, very hard to understand.

[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.040]
Oh, God.

[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.280]
But that's a good way to start out on a Friday.

[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.900]
We got the race, the second race, 144 from Gulf Stream Park.

[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.100]
Anybody got any tips there?

[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.320]
I'm not going to change my pick though.

[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.540]
I'm sticking with, I scoured theiform there.

[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.100]
I went on, Steve's not going to be out there today or what?

[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:20.440]
Yes.

[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:21.900]
Is he?

[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:22.620]
Yeah, he's anywhere.

[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.560]
I want me to make sure the racing channel is coming in because George gets all been out of shape

[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.920]
because he can't get it on the cable there.

[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.980]
Well, here's the metal ends.

[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.660]
There's Dave Willeron top of the tube.

[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.120]
George Brennan in the pocket.

[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.380]
And here comes somebody on the outside.

[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.200]
I can't see you.

[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.340]
Early morning call is working closer.

[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.720]
Now, second a length and a half.

[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.080]
Looks like Yanik Jingrod.

[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.300]
I'm talking that cover toward the outside as extravagant.

[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.440]
I know my drivers, baby.

[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.260]
I know those colors.

[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.520]
I know obscure crap.

[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.680]
And second over, there's the great Brian Sears who's off to a bad start this year for some reason.

[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.080]
I'm glad vindicated his race.

[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:55.600]
Living alone.

[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.220]
No chance.

[00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.160]
Early morning call trying to sustain his bed.

[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.320]
Well, Minko Dancer is there toward the outside.

[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.220]
But proud moment, yet some separation.

[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.500]
It's proud Momma with an eighth of a mile to go, opening up to a two and a half length lead.

[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.620]
And vindicated second.

[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.900]
Well, Minko Dancer closing on the outside.

[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.320]
They're heading down to the finish.

[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.520]
And here comes the great Brian Sears on the outside.

[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.200]
He looks at me like he's going to get second.

[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.040]
But proud moment will do it again.

[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:18.760]
And does.

[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.400]
It's a lot of the one from.

[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.660]
There you go.

[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.380]
There's the sell.

[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.320]
You can't play that.

[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.020]
They're going to get really upset across the street.

[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.000]
Did you hear that stuff yesterday?

[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.240]
No, I didn't hear that.

[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:27.940]
Oh, well.

[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.480]
You didn't know.

[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.640]
Well, what the hell were you doing?

[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.080]
Oh, that's right.

[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.040]
You've been promoted now.

[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.060]
Let's hear all about it.

[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.360]
I was doing one of my eight jobs yesterday.

[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:42.100]
This is a new assistant program director WQM flea flea Lee.

[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.180]
We'll talk about after the break.

[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.000]
So during the break, make up a bunch of stuff.

[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:47.280]
Okay.

[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.140]
In your mind, you don't think about the excuses you're going to get.

[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.600]
The fact that clearance is on the way out like that.

[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.580]
The fuck to our Friday, you bastards.

[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.240]
The inauguration of President Barack Obama.

[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.780]
People will forever remember the moment.

[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.220]
The majesty, the hat, the Aretha Franklin Mint proudly presents

[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.560]
Aretha's hat.

[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:14.180]
Now, you two can own the gaudy headwear worn by the queen of soul.

[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:19.620]
Yes, the hat in soft gray with its ginormous vidazzled bow,

[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.560]
making it one but ugly collectible headpiece.

[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:29.640]
Limited to just 300, Aretha's hat will thankfully only be offered for a short time.

[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:30.960]
So order yours today.

[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.920]
Own a piece of history.

[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.120]
Own the hat that no person with any self, areysp-easy-team.

[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.780]
Whatever wear from The Aretha Franklin Mint.

[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.620]
Okay, 1018 at 560 WQM.

[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.000]
Here's our award winning schedule.

[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.340]
Big O2, Mad Dog 4-7.

[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.600]
Everybody in the building.

[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.220]
Dolphin 9-7, away.

[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.800]
That's when everybody turns the radio off or at least somewhere else.

[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.420]
DA8-11 and then Greg Lyckin's 11-1.

[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.100]
Why is it we got a show from 11-1 on Friday night, not the other nights of the week?

[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:01.860]
Not really sure.

[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.120]
But you're the assistant PD now.

[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.240]
You should start sticking your nose into these things.

[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.400]
Yeah, I'm easing into it.

[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.320]
And by the way, thank you so much for doing something on our streaming.

[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.020]
So we don't get all those complaints anymore.

[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.020]
Oh, it's so bad.

[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.560]
It was so bad.

[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.180]
Tell us about your assignment as the new assistant PD.

[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.880]
Was that a legitimate, say I'm interrupting now.

[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:24.740]
I shouldn't interrupt.

[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.100]
So let me just say, no.

[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.420]
Go ahead.

[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.660]
It's more work for less money.

[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:32.160]
Less money.

[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.060]
Is that real?

[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:33.600]
Yeah.

[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.020]
You know, we all took a 5% pay cut and I was a part of that.

[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.560]
So I get the extra duties.

[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.620]
I get the 5% cut.

[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.400]
And you know, you took a 5% pay cut.

[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.980]
I took a 50% pay cut.

[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:46.400]
Oh, yeah.

[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:46.880]
Mr. Hodgeot.

[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:47.640]
Oh, I know you did.

[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:48.380]
Yeah.

[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.660]
And I'm not real thrilled about it either.

[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.040]
Okay, I'm still doing just fine as wine.

[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.640]
But believe me, I'm not happy about it.

[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:55.960]
Sure.

[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.120]
But then again, when they're doing this dime a dozen with the spots, you know.

[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.540]
Dollar a holler was bad enough, but a dime a dozen.

[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:05.020]
Oh, yeah.

[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.020]
And so what's your relationship now with Clarence?

[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:08.800]
What is he doing?

[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.320]
What do you do?

[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.500]
I will be assisting him.

[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.440]
So I'm really.

[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:11.720]

[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.500]
I'm in what?

[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.680]
Well, I've taken over the stream part of it as you can tell.

[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:16.560]
So I fixed that.

[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:22.700]
I'll be doing some of the imaging and stuff like that, scheduling that and doing some of the creative on that.

[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.680]
And working with some of the producers on how to do actual radio.

[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.180]
And actual radio.

[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.520]
Oh, boy.

[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.380]
So it's going to be a.

[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.880]
It'll be a long journey.

[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.380]
That's for sure.

[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.340]
Wow.

[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.400]
Actual radio.

[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.000]
You're in the wrong building for that, Mr.

[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.420]
I think after all this time, you to finger that out after all your association with Jolly Jo Bell.

[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.400]
You to figure it out.

[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.540]
He don't do actual radio.

[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.220]
Well, he's too busy texting the guys across the street is what I heard.

[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:51.900]
That's what I hear.

[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:53.880]
For what?

[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.600]
Why does he have this incestuous relationship with these people?

[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.640]
See, the one thing I've always said since this guy came to town.

[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.180]
When you're in this business, the one thing I've learned to do over the years is you compete.

[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.600]
You don't suck up to the competition.

[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.420]
You don't roll over and play dead.

[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.220]
You compete.

[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.320]
They don't compete.

[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.240]
They don't even want to.

[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.280]
Hey, Joe, how about competing?

[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.360]
Oh, I don't want to.

[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.120]
I don't want to.

[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.840]
I don't want to.

[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.700]
I think maybe too much marijuana.

[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.040]
Maybe that's the problem.

[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.920]
Maybe he endured your light and a big fat one.

[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.340]
Maybe them and what's his name?

[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.100]
Michael Phelps.

[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.760]
The space could have.

[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.420]
Could be.

[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:32.920]
So that's it.

[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:33.960]
That's you're just.

[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.420]
You're not going to like to make some major changes.

[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.220]
When are you going to get Clarissa hell out of there?

[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:39.920]
I'm trying.

[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.180]
I'm sure that.

[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.040]
That's what he did to Duff.

[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.760]
Duff's a great guy and Clarissa stabbed him in the back and screwed him over.

[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:48.840]
And now Duff's out there.

[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:49.720]
Pay way.

[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.580]
Just going nuts trying to be a salesholder in these difficult times.

[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.540]
Yeah, Duff is awesome.

[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:55.980]
Duff's a great guy.

[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.540]
He actually likes this show and he knows something about radio.

[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.460]
And he's you know, not a backstabbing fool like Clarins.

[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:10.740]
Clarins is whole deal as I'm sure you've discovered by now is he surrounds himself with his little funky's the beast and Robert Grieper and all his little boyfriends.

[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.460]
That's Clarins's idea of this business monkey business.

[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.480]
Not real business monkey business.

[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:23.920]
Now you're going to step up to the plate like Ross Perot would say step up from playing in like a kick him in the teeth and cut this crap.

[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.300]
I'm sure trying to get the beast off the air.

[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.680]
First of all, by the way, I see he's on the schedule tomorrow, four to seven.

[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.180]
Yeah.

[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.380]
You think he belongs on the air?

[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:32.860]
No.

[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.460]
Well, how come he's on four to seven?

[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.720]
You're the newest assistant PD.

[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.400]
Why don't you make a change right now?

[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.020]
Why don't you do four to seven tomorrow?

[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.500]
I would love to do four to seven tomorrow.

[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.620]
Well, why aren't you?

[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.160]
I don't know.

[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.480]
Josh doesn't put me on the schedule anymore.

[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.400]
Oh, Josh is still making out the schedule.

[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:46.860]
Yeah.

[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.060]
Maybe I should take that over now.

[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:49.840]
I can schedule who I want.

[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:52.820]
Sounds good to me.

[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.440]
And what about Geldie?

[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.100]
What happened to him?

[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.600]
He's still around, but I guess with hockey season, he's kind of busy.

[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.620]
He's busy?

[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.140]
Yeah.

[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.780]
Don't see him on the schedule at all.

[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.040]
Not thought I'm complaining about that.

[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.880]
I've got the train to game tonight.

[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.080]
Yeah, I know.

[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.800]
And I sure hope that we have more Panther fans than Ranger fans.

[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.060]
That would be really embarrassing when the other team has more of their people.

[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.080]
Rangers, by the way, their fans probably are abandoning that sinking ship fast anyway.

[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.300]
Leafs lost again last night in Tampa, but that's not news.

[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.640]
I mean, that just goes with the territory.

[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.160]
They suck.

[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:34.740]
Vesataska couldn't stop a beach ball thrown from a little five-year-old child, a hundred yards away.

[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:36.720]
They suck.

[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.740]
But at least I admit one of my team sucks as opposed to these people.

[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.380]
Oh, super ball.

[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.820]
They're often going to the super ball.

[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.120]
Yeah.

[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:43.900]
How'd that work out?

[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.060]
Let me say it again.

[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:46.940]
They can thank.

[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:47.980]
They can kiss.

[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.620]
Brett Farve on the ass for coming back for that one horrendous season.

[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.460]
And wait until the cane season this year.

[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.940]
They could start the season 0 and 4.

[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.640]
Now, you being negative about the canes?

[00:19:59.700 --> 00:19:59.900]
No.

[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.900]
You don't know the station you're on, Mr. Cleanson.

[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.760]
It's going to be really upset.

[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.120]
Arachite, dingbo.

[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:04.680]
That's right.

[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.220]
That's a tough schedule at the beginning of the season.

[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:06.440]
Good.

[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:06.940]
Good.

[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.480]
Hopefully lose them all.

[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.120]
All right, let me get to some of these.

[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:11.880]
Let me get to some of the first ones.

[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.040]
What?

[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:12.820]
Who they play?

[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.120]
The first one.

[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:13.600]
That's for sure.

[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:14.900]
Who?

[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:16.840]
Florida State.

[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:17.500]
Oh!

[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.220]
Bobby Bowden.

[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.720]
There's a real nose-picking Yehu for you.

[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.480]
That's right.

[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.140]
A real nose-picker.

[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:31.860]
Another one of those empire builders, like Woody Hayes and Bear Bryant.

[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.660]
Now, let's see.

[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:35.980]
Let me see what this one says.

[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.300]
There's a few of these about Miami.

[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.780]
Here's a picture of something in Miami.

[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.420]
Some street.

[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.780]
Street looks empty like a ghost town.

[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.400]
It looks like everybody has abandoned the town.

[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.500]
That's how it looks like here, another ghost town.

[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.540]
But, boy, I'm telling you this, sure.

[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.720]
A lot less traffic.

[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.120]
It's like everybody's gotten laid off.

[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.500]
There aren't as many people driving to work.

[00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.440]
Stuff like that.

[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.480]
You know what I mean?

[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.580]
That sounds about right.

[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.600]
About right for what?

[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.580]
The description of this city.

[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:06.740]
People lose their count.

[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.580]
No, talk about Toronto.

[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:08.660]
Oh, Toronto.

[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:09.520]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.640]
It's bad here, too.

[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:11.960]
Oh, come on.

[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.600]
Print this stupid thing out already.

[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.860]
William, I think it's frozen up.

[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.940]
Oh, I hate when my thing gets frozen up.

[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.260]
Here's one from JCP Black Knights,

[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.340]
whoever the hell that is.

[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.240]
It says, looks like he's lost the magic touch.

[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.400]
He's only one eight of his last hundred-one races,

[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.280]
meaning Brian Sears.

[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.460]
Also, Erica Dell has only one win in his last hundred-twenty-five starts.

[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.680]
Well, who the hell cares?

[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.120]
Dick, Dick, what's his name?

[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.360]
From Pompo, Park.

[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.300]
Dick Feinberg.

[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.820]
You used to always give me the song dance about.

[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.920]
Erica Dell is overrated and blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.880]
And Erica Dell now is racing in New York,

[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:55.800]
and was doing really well,

[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.020]
really gotten those cold spots.

[00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.340]
Don't worry about Brian Sears.

[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.560]
He hasn't lost the magic touch.

[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:00.900]
Don't worry about Brian.

[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.580]
He'll be back.

[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.480]
Go away with your caca.

[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.480]
Yeah, let's talk some harness racing with the fleet today.

[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.120]
That should be good for a minus-minus.

[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.000]
Okay, let's see what this says.

[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.040]
Oh, it didn't even print out.

[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.940]
Something about the Forbes thing.

[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.260]
I guess I'll have to go back.

[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.940]
Unless I already deleted it.

[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.320]
I want computers screwed up.

[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:28.600]
Uh-oh.

[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:29.720]
It is.

[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.660]
My outlook and stress won't come up.

[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.380]
It's time to reboot.

[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.040]
No, there it is.

[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.540]
Even if you accept the premise that Forbes should rank based on the city of Miami,

[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.880]
we're only 400,000 of the areas five million people live,

[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.260]
and which is carved out basically the worst part of the like Liberty City,

[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.180]
those violent crime stats are outdated.

[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.800]
Yada, yada, yada, yada.

[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.180]
Overall, housing prices in Miami have done better, for example,

[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.060]
over a 10-year period.

[00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.320]
For example, number one, take a look at your house,

[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.620]
even in crappy, broward with the old folies like you.

[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.060]
Are you up on it since you bought it?

[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.460]
Am I up on it since I bought it?

[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.440]
But boy, last year or two, man, it's gone down a lot.

[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.380]
I mean, way down.

[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.440]
Obviously, the answer is yes.

[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.420]
I only wish that anyone in complaints would leave,

[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.240]
less traffic for me since this idiot.

[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.260]
He likes it.

[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:18.740]
Well, good.

[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.620]
We're glad you like it.

[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.280]
Oh, here's one from the fake Tom Jicca about Lee Flea Feldman.

[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:26.680]
You ready?

[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:27.580]
Can you handle it?

[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.260]
I can handle it.

[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.720]
Oh, but we got to do the break first, damn it.

[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.640]
It's Friday, you bastard.

[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.860]
A ride's life won't be the same.

[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.640]
You can't blame the tabloids,

[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.640]
but still a straighter used his name.

[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.640]
A touch to steroids.

[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.360]
He just thought no one knew.

[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.640]
Cause you have been long ago, Modena.

[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.740]
Where are you?

[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.280]
When I read the Juman,

[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.600]
he shot steroids a day or night.

[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.280]
Back in 2003,

[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.300]
he shot steroids again,

[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.660]
hot air before he was a Yankee.

[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.100]
It was so wrong,

[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.960]
he's got to make it right.

[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.420]
Gonna have to go to call the big fight.

[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.220]
He shot steroids again,

[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.300]
hot air before he was a Yankee.

[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.360]
Yeah, he tried it.

[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.880]
Well, good for him.

[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.120]
It's 1032.

[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.780]
Let's see, the fake Tom Jicca has got a couple of emails here.

[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:48.780]
First one, it's a memo from Joe Bell to all QAM staff.

[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.880]
So the fake Tom Jicca is somebody inside the building.

[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:51.520]
Okay.

[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.500]
Ray Lee Flea Feldman.

[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.060]
I'm pleased to announce that Lee Flea Feldman will be taking over on,

[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.720]
taking on extra duties at WQM.

[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:00.860]
For the past year and a half,

[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.680]
Lee has done a great job as WQM's promotion and market director,

[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:04.680]
effective immediately,

[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.060]
he'll add assistant program director duties as well.

[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.560]
Lee is no stranger to programming.

[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.740]
We worked together in 99X and Ford Myers,

[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.960]
where Lee created one of the country's great alternative rock stations,

[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.580]
prior to joining WQM,

[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.780]
Lee was the APD and music director at 94ZADA.

[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.740]
A native of Tampa,

[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.840]
Lee also spent several years on there at 98 Rock.

[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.100]
I'm excited about the help that Lee can give me Josh in the entire station.

[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.800]
And then at the bottom,

[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.120]
it's Josh Dero program director with the phone numbers, et cetera.

[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.320]
Here's another one from the fake Tom Jicca, you ready?

[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.100]
And it says,

[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.540]
now it's interesting because it says,

[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.500]
sent from my mobile device,

[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.560]
Steve White program director,

[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.580]
790, the ticket.

[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.500]
Please ask Lee about the Q56 rumors.

[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.280]
You know the ones that they started across the street?

[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.360]
What is that?

[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.260]
Q56 that in March,

[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.200]
we're going oldies.

[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:55.580]
Oh wow.

[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.200]
That's the number they started.

[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:56.660]
What?

[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:57.680]
I didn't hear that.

[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.960]
That means it's true.

[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:02.520]
It could be.

[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.140]
Q56, I'll ride.

[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.500]
We got plenty of jingles.

[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.440]
You haven't heard that.

[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.460]
No, I haven't heard that.

[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.600]
But you're out of the loop, man.

[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:14.240]
You're out of touch.

[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.080]
WQAM is just your type.

[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.260]
And then since it is the weekend.

[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.540]
Oh, yeah.

[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.200]
All the oldies all the time.

[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.240]
Have a million dollar weekend.

[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.400]
WQAM, 56.

[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.120]
Rock solid.

[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.600]
So you honestly haven't heard anything about the Q56 rumors

[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.060]
that they started across the street?

[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:49.980]
No, I haven't heard that.

[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.120]
You think it's just a coincidence that the name on this fake email

[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.380]
is Steve White program director,

[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.340]
790, the ticket?

[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.520]
That is odd.

[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.720]
And that yesterday, Mark Haka,

[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.220]
Haka, China, whatever his name was,

[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.820]
who's the producer of the Dan Lebertur show.

[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.960]
He was the one sending us all those fake rumors about what was going on.

[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:07.740]
All this other crap.

[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.500]
This is what they do all day over there.

[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.440]
And then we find out that fat Josh Friedman,

[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.200]
he's also one of the fake e-mailers.

[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.740]
They wonder they lost a half a billion dollars last quarter?

[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.900]
Half a trillion dollars last quarter alone.

[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.920]
And wonder they're losing their ass because they got a whole bunch of people

[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.800]
on the payroll who sit around listening to this show

[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.960]
and sending fake e-mails and the playing games and patching around.

[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.300]
As they say in China,

[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:31.340]
patching around.

[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.040]
Too much patching over there at 790.

[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.480]
And I have no idea what the fascination is with those people

[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.080]
back and forth across the street.

[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.120]
You better tell your buddy, Jolly Jodat,

[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:41.800]
or you already did?

[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.300]
I did.

[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.480]
I never got to the pool here.

[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.620]
Tomorrow's Valentine's Day, of course.

[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.900]
The best way to describe my spouse or significant other is

[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.880]
my best friend, 206.

[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.600]
Don't have one, 187.

[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.400]
My soulmate, 134.

[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.720]
Fantastic, 64.

[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.300]
Bobbuster, 56.

[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.400]
That's our new slogan here.

[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:04.840]
Now that flea is the Sitton PD.

[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.720]
Ballbuster, 56, baby.

[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.760]
Ball and chain, 54.

[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:10.840]
Lot of balls in these.

[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.180]
Total bitch, 43.

[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.300]
History, 36.

[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.080]
The bitch is gone.

[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.320]
Hot, 32.

[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.600]
Gorgeous, 21.

[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:17.880]
Fat, 19.

[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:18.740]
Sluts, 17.

[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:19.680]
And Bloodsucker, 12.

[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:20.860]
8.81 on the pool.

[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.900]
Oh, by the way, speaking of hot.

[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.100]
Some movie last night, which I really, I don't know why I watched it.

[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.740]
Because I'm always ripping these remakes of movies.

[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.800]
Not sequels, but remakes of movies that were really good and didn't need to be

[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.040]
made.

[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.780]
The hitcher, the 2007 version of the hitcher.

[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.380]
Did you see it?

[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.020]
No, I did not.

[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.220]
Have you seen the original one?

[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:38.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.340]
With the TV Thomas Howell and Rucker Hower?

[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.260]
Yeah, it was a good movie.

[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:43.620]
It's a great movie.

[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:44.900]
Well, they remade it.

[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.120]
And I watched a little bit of it once before.

[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.860]
For, I guess I forgot that the damn hockey game was online.

[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.060]
And I thank God for that.

[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.860]
I'm not talking about the Panther game, the Leafs game.

[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.660]
64 loss in the Tampa.

[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.740]
But anyway, I started watching.

[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.560]
I thought, well, I'll watch it, even though the guy who was kind of ugly.

[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.100]
And I don't want to spoil the movie for you, but you know how she got the

[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.740]
tied between the two trucks by what's almost a guy's name?

[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.180]
John.

[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:10.880]
Oh, it'll come to me.

[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.740]
The fake name he made up.

[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.220]
Yeah, I don't know.

[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:14.540]
Rucker Hower.

[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.020]
John something.

[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.860]
But anyway, so the chick I tied between the two trucks in the first one,

[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.160]
but then this one, the guy gets tied up and he actually gets split in half.

[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.600]
The truck takes off and bloop.

[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.880]
Oh, half of his body goes one way and the other half just gets.

[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.860]
They don't dwell on it very long.

[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.220]
It's not something you have to look at.

[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:34.580]
Right.

[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.100]
You know what I mean?

[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:36.660]
It's not a pretty sight.

[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.100]
But anyway, the chicken movie is pretty, she's hot.

[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.460]
So you might want to see it.

[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.200]
All you heteros out there, there's somebody for you to look at on it.

[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.140]
And there's a naked shower scene.

[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.020]
You don't see any boobies or anything, but there's, you know, in the motel.

[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.460]
Not very erotic, but nevertheless.

[00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:00.020]
New York City Dave, who's so chronic that it just makes me want to get in my hands and ease and vomit.

[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.020]
Just puke up meals from 100 years ago.

[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.740]
Oh, God, chronic, chronic, chronic, chronic, chronic, chronic.

[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:07.800]
God.

[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.240]
He says, good morning, Neil and Flea.

[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.040]
First, I'd like to thank Flea for fixing the commercials on the internet feed.

[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.860]
Neil, I was watching a movie last night called a love song for Bobby Long.

[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.600]
There was a scene in there dealing with alcoholics.

[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.840]
One of the characters was looking for a mixer in his drink.

[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.840]
He couldn't find one and mixed his gin with pickle juice.

[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.420]
That was tough.

[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.980]
I was thinking for a pool idea which, which movie had the most desperate alcoholics.

[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.480]
Anyway, it was a good movie.

[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.080]
A love song for Bobby Long.

[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.840]
Maybe he had another chance, another shot of love.

[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:40.620]
I don't know.

[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.920]
Kick it a wood by in this weekend.

[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.360]
I will not be going to wood by in this weekend because I won't be here.

[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:46.900]
New York City Dave.

[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.880]
Flea gets some good grab as it tuts his, yeah.

[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.460]
A married man and he's telling him to get a glistening good grab ass.

[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.340]
And tuts his no less.

[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.720]
You hang out of tuts his.

[00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.540]
I wouldn't say I hang out there, but I've been there.

[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:00.480]
You've been there.

[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.320]
Oh my God.

[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:01.860]
And I'm not here.

[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.440]
I'm hearing a rumor.

[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.440]
The Rangers are bringing back the 94 cup team to finish out this season.

[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.980]
Oh my God.

[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.200]
Yeah.

[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:14.980]
The least of bringing back Johnny Power and Frank Mahablaj and George Armstrong.

[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.520]
By the way, the girl in the movie that you're talking about, the hitter name is Sophia Bush.

[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:19.940]
The I end.

[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:20.400]
She's pretty.

[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:21.600]
She's beautiful.

[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:21.940]
Yeah.

[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.840]
And the guy is like he ain't no see Thomas Hall.

[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:25.480]
I'll tell you that.

[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.200]
He's pretty marginal at best.

[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:33.860]
And then when he gets like pulled in half, he gets yanked right there between the two trucks.

[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.100]
I shouldn't have told you that because then I'll ruin the whole movie for you.

[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.180]
John Ryder.

[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.320]
That's the name.

[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:39.800]
Thank you.

[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.400]
John Ryder.

[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.520]
That's the name of the lunatic.

[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.980]
The cra- although I don't think in this one they had the finger food scene.

[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.620]
They they changed it all around.

[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.220]
It's the same story but they changed it enough to make it like I don't know.

[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:52.660]
I wouldn't.

[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.600]
It's certainly not better.

[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.820]
And it did not need to be remade.

[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.820]
Why do they because they have no new ideas?

[00:31:59.180 --> 00:31:59.360]
Yep.

[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.160]
Well, there's your president.

[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.620]
I asked to save billions of dollars and countless wives.

[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:06.920]
Where is ours?

[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:07.800]
That's what we want to know.

[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.800]
Where's our chunk?

[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.720]
We want our chunk of change, man.

[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.040]
We want a couple of million over here.

[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.240]
I'll split it with you.

[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:13.800]
How do you like that?

[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:15.560]
Yeah.

[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.220]
I'll split it with you even.

[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.440]
Twenty before 11 at 560 WQM.

[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.540]
No George flea is here today and thank the Lord.

[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.240]
We haven't had a whole bunch of those emails saying,

[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.280]
Oh, what a breath of her here to hear flea.

[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:27.780]
We hate George.

[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.560]
You know, we have, I guess what's her name?

[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.140]
Marisa or whatever her name was in the beginning.

[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:37.340]
She put that to a halt with her kissy kissy with George and how I'm an old fart.

[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.700]
And she doesn't understand my humor.

[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.580]
And she listens but she don't know what the hell I'm talking about.

[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.340]
But you know what Marisa or whatever your name is?

[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.440]
I don't know what I'm talking about either.

[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.780]
And I get paid a lot of money for doing it.

[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.020]
So screw you bitch.

[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.160]
Me you.

[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.160]
Yeah.

[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:53.840]
Attention investors.

[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.340]
Because of the Bernie made off punzy scheme,

[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.140]
we want to warn you about another scam designed to steal your money.

[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.640]
It's called the funzy scheme.

[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.720]
Here's how it works.

[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.080]
A cool man in a leather jacket is standing by the jukebox.

[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.260]
As you prepare to invest a quarter to hear your favorite song,

[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.480]
he coaches you into his office, the bathroom,

[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.960]
and suggests you invest your quarter with him.

[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.760]
Exactly the mongoose.

[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.900]
He then walks up to the jukebox and with a quick wrap of his fist,

[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.460]
your song comes on and he pockets your money.

[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:23.860]
Whoa.

[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:29.080]
So next time you're approached by a cool leather jacket wearing man about your investments,

[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.700]
we suggest you sit on it and don't be such a potsy.

[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.140]
Beware the funzy scheme.

[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:35.780]
Hey.

[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.300]
Hey my ass.

[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.480]
1046.

[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:40.760]
Oh here's what about you.

[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.040]
It's from the fake Hawk Mark.

[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:42.820]
Uh oh.

[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.680]
Or the real Hawk Mark, the producer of the Dan Leviturge show.

[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:48.980]
You want to hear it?

[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:49.820]
Yes sir.

[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:50.980]
Well I haven't seen it yet.

[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:51.560]
Let me see if I...

[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.260]
My outlook express is functioning very slowly today.

[00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:00.900]
The producer you have on today is one QAM's least favorite person here at the ticket.

[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:05.040]
And what do they don't do that well?

[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:05.640]
They're illiterate.

[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.040]
Is one... does that make any sense?

[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:15.260]
He is named for starting the rumors about Sid Leading for New York and saying that Jorge Sardano is moving to mornings and being replaced by syndicated shows.

[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:15.800]
That's right.

[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.660]
You started those rumors and were proud of you for it.

[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:17.840]
Yep.

[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:23.120]
Sardano was so mad he actually requested a meeting fight out if it was true with the program director.

[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.360]
How does Effing Lee Feldman know the ins and outs of this station?

[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.500]
And I'm the last one to fight out.

[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.900]
He yelled so hard we heard it out here.

[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.320]
Hey Lee Feldman.

[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:36.680]
Sardano and Sid despise you and now that you've assumed PD it's going to be on.

[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.660]
It's going to be on.

[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.860]
How about this?

[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.500]
Both those losers can kiss my ass.

[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.480]
Don't broadcast Panther broadcast.

[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.520]
That was the final warning yesterday afternoon.

[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.780]
If Rodgers ever puts anything related to a Panther is a broadcast, we will sue.

[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.540]
We'll go ahead and boy name sue.

[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:56.900]
Anything related to a Panther broadcast.

[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.520]
How about this?

[00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.960]
It's related to a Panther broadcast.

[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.000]
It's Geldie.

[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.240]
We on the rights to Geldie.

[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.220]
Sorry there, Hawk Mark.

[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:04.480]
Hawk Murnus came China.

[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.460]
God wouldn't idiot.

[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.480]
Oh, Barry Jackass has got one about flea.

[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.620]
Boy, you're pretty popular today.

[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:15.700]
Can you ask me the comment of the rumors about WQM format changed to old East-Style sports hybrid.

[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.960]
Steve White and Howard Davis are hoping these rumors are true by the way.

[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.080]
No, they're not hoping if they're the ones who started it.

[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.560]
Like I said, the ticket is all over the email here today.

[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.440]
They did all over it.

[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:29.900]
Wow.

[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.660]
Are you ready for this or what?

[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.920]
I mean, just insane.

[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.200]
I was assessed.

[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.100]
Oh, Byron Pagan must have the Wonder Dog have nerd from them in a long time.

[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.980]
No wonder I've been in the good mood in Meridian, Idaho.

[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.720]
You were talking about music on 560.

[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.380]
I have a double LP of music they played.

[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:48.220]
I'm looking for it, but I have a lot of albums.

[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.380]
I think everyone bought around 1970 or 69.

[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.280]
I hope I find it.

[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.000]
We'll send you an email, some of the songs.

[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.460]
High flea.

[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.100]
Neil will miss you next week, but have fun.

[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:57.580]
Okay.

[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.080]
Okay.

[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.500]
And the mole is back.

[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.240]
Oh, brother, they're all out today.

[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:04.780]
This is good.

[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.800]
I think you brought them out.

[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.740]
I don't have our assistant PD on here.

[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.280]
This is like the old show we used to do.

[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.300]
Ask the program director.

[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.440]
Do you want to do a show like that?

[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.320]
Ask the assistant PD?

[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:14.860]
Sure.

[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.780]
The Texas Department of State Health Services on Thursday ordered to recall of all products

[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:23.360]
ever shipped from the peanut corporation of America's plan and plane view Texas

[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.800]
after discovering dead rodents, rodents,

[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.580]
and excrement and bird feathers in the plant.

[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.020]
And it's got pictures of peanuts.

[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.980]
Well, why do we care about this?

[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:33.660]
The mole.

[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.820]
Yeah, mole my ass.

[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:35.200]
Okay.

[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.480]
Give us something interesting like some in inside radio crap.

[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:41.740]
Isn't that what we all want to hear?

[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.160]
Yes.

[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.060]
Well, we're sure getting plenty of it today.

[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.780]
You're the most despised person across the street for picking on them.

[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.760]
Quit picking on them.

[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.940]
Okay. They're like a bunch of infants.

[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:50.700]
They can't handle it.

[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:51.500]
I take pride in that.

[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:52.260]
I'm glad they hate me.

[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.040]
I hate them.

[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.560]
Why is everybody always picking on me?

[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.540]
Charlie Brown, that's it.

[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.460]
The Joker says, if you've seen death proof with Kurt Russell,

[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.620]
good flick with some nice cars your show rocks.

[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.280]
Well, the Joker, let me say this to you.

[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.660]
If Kurt Russell's in it, I ain't seen it.

[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.160]
There is a handful of people.

[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.680]
If they're in the movie, I will not watch it.

[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.180]
Bruce Willis is one of them.

[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:14.340]
What's his name?

[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.040]
The homophob.

[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.460]
From Australia.

[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:19.660]
Mel Gibson.

[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:19.940]
Mel Gibson.

[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.100]
I will not watch it with him.

[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.460]
Trying to think of somebody else.

[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.040]
There aren't too many.

[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.120]
Because every now and then there's a good movie with somebody that you absolutely despise.

[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:30.420]
Oh.

[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.120]
Got some bad news.

[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.060]
You know Kelly Mitchell?

[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.080]
No.

[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.500]
Former TV anchor Kelly Mitchell in critical condition.

[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.460]
This is by Joan Fleischman.

[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.980]
So there might be some truth to it in the herald.

[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.200]
Veterans South Florida broadcaster Kelly Mitchell is intensive care

[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.220]
and Mount Sinai Medical Center her condition critical but stable.

[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:58.480]
Mitchell 52 formerly a WSVN Fox 7 anchor and WPLG ABC 10 reporter was diagnosed with breast cancer in December of 02.

[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.180]
No word on whether her hospitalization is cancer related.

[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.500]
It's a long process involving a lot of tests.

[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.520]
Mitchell says to her hospital spokeswoman Lori Fagan-Holtz.

[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:14.560]
Mitchell says her longtime fiance WSVN chief photographer Kirk Wade 47 is very busy fluffing pillows in her hospital room

[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.900]
and keeping everything running at home where they have two dogs.

[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:23.840]
The feisty Mitchell as a Mercedes convertible with license tag back to you also co-hosted a morning show on WFT LA 50.

[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.120]
And we wish you're well Kelly Mitchell.

[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.560]
You don't know who that is?

[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.400]
No, I don't.

[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.800]
Well, you're an interlofer man.

[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:31.440]
You're an outsider.

[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.380]
You're a carpet bagger.

[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.640]
Tampa guy by way of four Myers knee comes in all of a sudden.

[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.440]
He's the assistant PD although it's good.

[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:41.760]
What an improvement though.

[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.760]
Already the people listening on the stream.

[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:51.580]
Isn't that something how we have like 50,000 people complaining about the damn stream and about all those PSAs over and over in the big O spots.

[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:55.120]
And then you change them and put some marginally interesting crap on there.

[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.660]
And we've had maybe two or three say, oh, well, thank you for doing that.

[00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:58.140]
Flea.

[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:58.360]
Right.

[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:04.580]
If it's something negative, there is no limit on the amount of response you get from software.

[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.800]
If it's something positive, something to be kissed or ground for.

[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.700]
Well, maybe a handful of people might notice it.

[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:15.040]
Or at least be a decent enough to say thanks for the memory, something.

[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.100]
The fake Larry King says Flea is sounding great.

[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:23.820]
Maybe you can make this a regular thing reminds me of when Hank's famous asked the program director to say me with Andrew Ascenewoods.

[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.820]
That was great radio.

[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.180]
No, it was not great radio.

[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.620]
Andrew Ascenewoods was not great radio.

[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.540]
He died by the way.

[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.460]
Oh, and by the way, I found the audio of Hank falling asleep.

[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:33.560]
Did you?

[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:33.840]
Yep.

[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.120]
Well, before you do that, if you got it.

[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:37.780]
Yeah.

[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:38.620]
I don't want to write now.

[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.740]
Let me read you this email and see if you get upset.

[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.640]
It's probably a fake anyway.

[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.180]
Were you listening yesterday?

[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.360]
What's I listening yesterday?

[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.420]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:55.220]
Were you listening yesterday when Hank Goldberg called in the LeBaster show?

[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:55.620]
Oh, yeah.

[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.960]
I listened to the LeBaster show religiously.

[00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.320]
Was I listening yesterday?

[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.520]
What is with you people?

[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.520]
Don't you understand it?

[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:02.420]
God.

[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.920]
Am I the only LeBaster listener who also listened to the Arragist probably?

[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.560]
They were talking about the best movie scene ever filmed in Miami, Hank called in with the Goldfinger card game.

[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.160]
And then Ron St. John came in the studio with something else.

[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.380]
Ron St. John.

[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.180]
You see, what does he do now, Ron St. John?

[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:18.900]
I don't know.

[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.680]
You know who that is?

[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:20.980]
Nope.

[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:22.440]
Nope.

[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:23.640]
Nope.

[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:28.140]
You know, if you're going to be the assistant PD on WQAM, one of the legendary self-floater radio stations,

[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.220]
you better start learning your radio history, mister.

[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.980]
Ron St. John used to be the PA guy for the dolphins.

[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:33.760]
Oh.

[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.980]
Before that knucklehead Kenny Walker took over.

[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.760]
Let's talk about PA announcers like Jay Rokiech.

[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:47.120]
Hurricane Gold, scarred by, well, the hurricanes don't play hockey, so.

[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.680]
I don't think you'll start with that Panther stuff.

[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.360]
We'll sue your ass.

[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:50.180]
I like Bill Murphy.

[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.840]
I like Bill Murphy.

[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:52.580]
Over at Panthers.

[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:53.860]
Good guy.

[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.120]
Now, because the first guy, the first Panther PA, which I don't remember what his name was, he was the best.

[00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:58.580]
He was good.

[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.140]
Panther's goals.

[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.040]
And this guy tries to copy him, but not well.

[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.920]
But anyway, I don't know up PA announcers.

[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.900]
I don't want to, you know, is what's his name still doing the Yankee games?

[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.840]
The 500 year old, um, I don't know.

[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.000]
Ladies and gentlemen, oh, you know what I'm talking about.

[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.320]
The Yankees PA announcer, legendary.

[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:20.560]
Google it.

[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:22.660]
I think he's still working.

[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.100]
He's got to be 150 years old.

[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:24.560]
Easy.

[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:26.740]
Bob.

[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:27.960]
Bob Shepard.

[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:28.760]
Shepard.

[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:29.100]
Very good.

[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.160]
See, I came up with the first name.

[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.060]
You came up with the last name.

[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.740]
He's no relation to Kelly Shepard.

[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:33.180]
Thank God.

[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.940]
How can he still be driving anywhere?

[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.020]
Good God.

[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:37.600]
Jesus.

[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.980]
He's been in the aftertaste.

[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.360]
1951.

[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:43.340]
58 years.

[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.020]
He's been the PA announcer there.

[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:45.420]
Wow.

[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.040]
Batting for the Yankees.

[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:51.780]
Number seven.

[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:52.320]
Mickey.

[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:52.860]
Mental.

[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.000]
Number seven.

[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:54.700]
Centerfield.

[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:55.880]
Wow.

[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:57.920]
I can't do that.

[00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.140]
I don't have that stintorian voice.

[00:41:59.280 --> 00:41:59.920]
And you sure so?

[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:02.340]
Don't know.

[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.480]
He was also the PA announcer for the giant.

[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.240]
That's right.

[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.760]
The near football giant says correct.

[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:09.520]
I don't know why it is.

[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.380]
I keep interrupting you.

[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.060]
So if I interrupt, just say,

[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:12.680]
go ahead.

[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.220]
I guess I got to say that.

[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:18.300]
John and L.A. says I couldn't agree more than that network

[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.960]
is one of the best American films ever made.

[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:22.880]
By letting the characters say exactly what was on their minds,

[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:26.720]
Patty Trapsky's angry dialogue connected with the viewers on a deep emotional level

[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.720]
that other writers were never able to do.

[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.040]
Right.

[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.680]
Besides network here in the Oscar for that one,

[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.460]
I appreciate this other screenplays like Marty and a hospital

[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.840]
as well as one of my personal favorite altered states.

[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.840]
Hospital with George C. Scott was another great movie, right away.

[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.780]
You want to see what a bunch of butchers do when you go to a hospital,

[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:44.500]
watch that movie.

[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.580]
But he was a master at humor too.

[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.960]
And the hospital, George C. Scott plays the hospital chief doctor.

[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.100]
After he had another patient was accidentally assassinated during the night,

[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.200]
he asked the head of nursing,

[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.440]
where do you train your nurses?

[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:55.140]
Doc Owl?

[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.700]
I'm originally from the Gables,

[00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.840]
but I've been in the binocent here in LA for many years.

[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:03.960]
I once briefly met Chioski before he died at some of the writer's guild.

[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:04.720]
I walked up in the set,

[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:05.920]
excuse me, Mr. Chioski.

[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.220]
He spun around and said,

[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.220]
what the hell do you want?

[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:09.860]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:10.280]
All right.

[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:11.840]
My kind of guy.

[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.000]
What the hell do you want?

[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:14.640]
John and LA.

[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:15.180]
That's good.

[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:15.620]
Isn't that cute?

[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:16.460]
Yep.

[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:18.240]
Now you love network. I'm sure.

[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.120]
Oh, great movie.

[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.260]
Anybody who doesn't like that movie is either a dumb punk,

[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.540]
too stupid to understand it like Josh Cortis.

[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.500]
Or just, you know, just has bad taste.

[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:33.040]
Just has bad taste like so many people who love their vanilla ice cream.

[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:33.940]
Oh, Neil!

[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:34.340]
Yeah?

[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.020]
This is the Neil Roger show.

[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.100]
I'm tired of it.

[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.840]
This is your brain.

[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:40.160]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:41.800]
Any question?

[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.840]
Happy Valentine's Day.

[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.880]
It's like an evil conspiracy created by the...

[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.000]
the breeding cars people and the fire people and the candy people.

[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:50.620]
Yeah, fly.

[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.480]
Nothing.

[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.020]
Call me out, John's city.

[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:57.260]
Maybe the hog got your little stuff to say Valentine's Day.

[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:58.660]
It's like a dream.

[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.440]
A dinner for the play.

[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.320]
This happens to me every Valentine's Day.

[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:08.300]
You're probably mixing up on me this cheap okay.

[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.420]
I got you a corsage.

[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.280]
Yes, stop.

[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.960]
I'm on a cast for Valentine's Day.

[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.500]
Where's this crap?

[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:23.040]
I don't have that much to spend.

[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.620]
A flame!

[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:25.940]
A flame!

[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:27.420]
A flame!

[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:28.540]
A flame!

[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.840]
Oh, come on!

[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.420]
It's Valentine's Day for crying out loud.

[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.300]
Well, Happy Valentine's Day.

[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.620]
All the ladies out there.

[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.920]
And I guess you can say Happy Valentine's Day to the guys.

[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:41.840]
Yeah, can't you?

[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.520]
Can't you?

[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:45.920]
Yeah.

[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.520]
Oh, well, I thought for a second that you disappeared.

[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.220]
I was talking to Jesse Agler.

[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.420]
About what?

[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.960]
I was just shooting a crap.

[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.080]
About the Bob Shepherd actually.

[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.100]
Really?

[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:00.500]
Yeah.

[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.020]
Well, Jesse's a big baseball guy.

[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.200]
Is he really?

[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:04.380]
Bob Shepherd's still alive.

[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.240]
That's the amazing thing.

[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.420]
Yep, he's seen a 13 World Series Championships with the Yankees and 22 penance.

[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:11.880]
Well, good for him.

[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.000]
He's getting a little bit on in years.

[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.320]
You know, to be a whole old is he?

[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:18.180]
He was born in 1910.

[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.700]
So that makes him 90-89.

[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.000]
89.

[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:22.620]
And October.

[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:23.920]
Wow.

[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:26.860]
I think that's old enough to croak.

[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:28.320]
Yeah, our permission, Bob.

[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.060]
He's good though.

[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:29.580]
I enjoyed him.

[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.960]
I enjoyed Mel Allen tremendously.

[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.200]
And Red Barber and, uh, who else?

[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:35.220]
Jim Woods.

[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.660]
I was a big Harry Carey fan.

[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.360]
Well, you were a big Harry Carey.

[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.180]
Who the hell wasn't?

[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.580]
Who was a baseball fan?

[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.840]
It wouldn't be a Harry Carey fan.

[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:43.360]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.900]
Hey, enough with the Panthers already.

[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:50.080]
When the hell was the baseball season begin anyway, huh?

[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.480]
This was Harry and that's my opinion.

[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.000]
Wow.

[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.780]
And Walt Disney was nothing to do with it.

[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.780]
Harry hated this guy.

[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.400]
This is the guy from Chicago that did all,

[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.700]
he had imitated him to perfection.

[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:05.440]
That's good.

[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:06.920]
And Harry hated him.

[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.340]
Hey, I got to screw yourself, Rogers.

[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.420]
The Marlins.

[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.380]
Who the hell are the Marlins?

[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.160]
Oh, Lake Cow.

[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.880]
It's the Neil Rogers show.

[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.480]
I'm W.I.

[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.080]
Well, D.

[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.880]
And there's a lot more.

[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.640]
Anyway, I had him on my show and I would do that one time

[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.640]
from Murphy's Bleachers across from Ridley Field.

[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.340]
I'd been there.

[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:34.080]
And we didn't expect he'd come in because it was too close to game time.

[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.780]
And sure enough, he came waddling up the stairs and wandled a lot.

[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.080]
It was a lot of fun.

[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:38.940]
He was great.

[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:39.340]
Yep.

[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:44.000]
And only an old far like me could have reminisced with him about the days he did the St. Louis

[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.220]
Billiken's basketball games on KMOX.

[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:46.840]
Wow, what?

[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.720]
St. Louis Billiken's.

[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.820]
St. Louis University basketball team.

[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:52.580]
Oh, wow.

[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:53.880]
He did that.

[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.160]
And he was great at that too.

[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.400]
Because he generated a lot of excitement.

[00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:02.460]
I'm like the play by play sports announcers in South Florida, most of whom like Dave and

[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:05.720]
Boring sound like they need some no-dose like they're going into a coma.

[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:10.540]
A coma, as Mo would say, a coma.

[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.560]
They're really bad.

[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.240]
How can there be so many bad sportscasters in one market?

[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.680]
Now, and what's the story about Joseph Gackie?

[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.820]
Is he finally getting tossed out?

[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:22.320]
Not that I've heard, no.

[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.800]
Did I dream that or was it just wishful thinking or why?

[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.080]
I'm sure I heard that somewhere.

[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:30.740]
I think I put that in your brain because I said that Jesse Agler was good enough to do the extra.

[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.000]
You know, you start a lot of rumors that are BS.

[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.820]
Okay, no wonder they hate you across the street.

[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.440]
You're the one that started all that crap about, let's see,

[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.220]
Sid the kid was going to a serious and Sadhana was doing mornings and they were

[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.300]
putting syndicated on from like 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.340]
Aren't you the one that started that?

[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:45.440]
Some of that, yeah.

[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.580]
And why did you do that?

[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.600]
Just to be a troublemaker or did you actually have the information that was bogus?

[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.140]
Well, we'll see.

[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:50.920]
It could still be true.

[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:54.880]
Oh, oh, and by the way, Ron St. James does afternoon drive on magic.

[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.520]
Ron St. John, not Ron St. James Boy.

[00:47:58.700 --> 00:47:58.880]
Oh, yeah, St. John.

[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.780]
Anybody who doesn't know Ron St. John knows nothing about this market.

[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.360]
Well, legendary Ron St. John.

[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.360]
Trying to think of what he does these days, where we hear his voice.

[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:12.160]
He does what afternoon's on magic.

[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.520]
That is correct.

[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.080]
Still on there.

[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.120]
Boy, that magic man.

[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.460]
Ricky Tiki was on there about 100 years before he finally retired.

[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:21.840]
And then Ron St. John has been on there.

[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.480]
I think they Fox was on there too for a while.

[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:24.100]
You know, say Fox?

[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:24.520]
Oh, I do.

[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:25.720]
Have you met him?

[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:26.020]
Yes.

[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.500]
He's just as incoherent as person as he's on the year.

[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:29.720]
That's the great thing about Sonny.

[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:30.120]
Mm-hmm.

[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:31.480]
He hates me like poison.

[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:35.580]
He puts on a good act, but hates me like, in fact, too bad I can't play that.

[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.200]
That one drop in.

[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:40.740]
Hi, this is Sonny Fox.

[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.820]
I listen to your Rogers because I can hear the word after.

[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.980]
Yeah, you know what the word is.

[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:45.500]
Mm-hmm.

[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:46.240]
A-hole.

[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:48.880]
And we can't even play that anymore.

[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:49.940]
That's the sad part.

[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.340]
I bet your son is still listening.

[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:54.860]
Well, let's see.

[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:56.560]
Got some crap about it.

[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.220]
Here we go.

[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.220]
TR says that last guy is the only crossover listener between you and LaBass turd.

[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:04.580]
I've emailed you prior to that I suffer for the hour between two and three

[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:09.320]
because Radio is dead, proofing the schlocked QAM and 790 from two to three.

[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:15.100]
I personally know a lot of my buddies who are 30 somethings, although I don't have much longer to be able to say that, who listen to both.

[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:19.380]
He's not Neil, who is, but he's definitely solid stuff, meaning LaBass turd.

[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:27.780]
In any event, how the hell do we get Georgian sometimes, we can actually have solid radio spread over several stations here in Paradise again since TR.

[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.780]
Well, it flea puts Georgian on two to four.

[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.700]
Now, when's the change taking place two to four?

[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:34.000]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:35.720]
It is coming though, right?

[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:36.340]
Could be.

[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:40.380]
Why don't you don't start equivocating now and beating around the bush.

[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:43.680]
Usually you're looking up front guy like I asked you this morning about Gary Sarner and you said,

[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.640]
major a hole or something like that.

[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.600]
Yeah, I hate him like poison.

[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:47.440]
Do you really?

[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:48.300]
Yeah, I don't like the guy.

[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:52.820]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.320]
Wow, you are sensational.

[00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:01.280]
Not just because you hate him like poison because everybody else does too, but just because you have the cajon's to say it.

[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.220]
As opposed to most of the meaty mouse that we put on, oh geez, I never said that.

[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:07.580]
You know, like that.

[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:12.960]
Even George very often denies it and then accuses me of getting him in trouble with people.

[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:13.500]
Well, too bad.

[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.660]
He hates Gary Sarner too, but he wouldn't say it.

[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.900]
George will be on all next week, by the way, with Flee because I'll be on vacation.

[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:20.560]
So what's your name?

[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:21.540]
She can be real excited.

[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:22.720]
I'm going to be away all next week.

[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.020]
What was your name or was there or something?

[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:26.420]
Yeah, we want to start of the show with that sour.

[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:30.520]
She doesn't understand my humor because I'm an old fart and she's only a 20 something bitch.

[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:31.860]
Too bad, honey.

[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:37.060]
God, well, we'll get you an interpreter trusting and understand what I'm talking about.

[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.640]
Oh, when you show ends, it's like after a traffic crash or something.

[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.860]
Believe me, that's how I feel about it many days.

[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:52.900]
The Faggy M. Sarner says, I can tell you without a doubt that the emails you've been getting from across the street are not from our cockman.

[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:55.780]
I spoke with one of my sources at 790 S.

[00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:02.560]
It seems the most likely sources are either sit himself or his board off who started the fake email trend on a bastard show before he worked there.

[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:07.240]
Word is, sit as addicted to your show, which isn't surprising considering as many other addictions.

[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:09.540]
Signed the fake gym, sorry, P.S.

[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:14.320]
As you're not going to like this.

[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:14.660]
Okay.

[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.660]
What you might like it.

[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:20.040]
P.S., ask if he's ever seen Joe Bell's P bag.

[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:23.240]
I wonder how many times he has to empty it in the QM's minz room per day.

[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:24.620]
I haven't seen that.

[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.400]
Now does he really have a P bag?

[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:27.500]
Not that I know of.

[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.440]
Yeah, and I see you can't keep a straight face.

[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:36.240]
When he first came to the station, he was, he had some downtime, so to speak.

[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.380]
And he was having some P problems as I recall.

[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:39.800]
Right.

[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.960]
Because he told me about it, which I didn't want you really want to hear about it.

[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:46.800]
Having seen him, I didn't want to hear about his P problems.

[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.620]
But nevertheless, so maybe he's got a P bag.

[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:49.820]
That would explain a lot.

[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:51.620]
You think?

[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:52.140]
Yeah.

[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:53.940]
Well, that would smell bad.

[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.220]
I know Fat Rich Waffer Wilder had a P bag.

[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:00.840]
Oh, not only sitting in the dinner at Pompano Park in the dining room.

[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:05.180]
And somebody sitting across him was wearing a P bag or worse.

[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.440]
A douce bag.

[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.980]
Oh, maybe that's where the expression came from.

[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:10.520]
Douce bag.

[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.840]
We can say that one.

[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.200]
Call Joy, see if we can say douce bag.

[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:15.860]
Okay.

[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.240]
How about douchey box?

[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:22.360]
The fake jewelry rental says, tell Alice the best iPod app for listening to WQM is Wonder Ground.

[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:22.900]
It's great.

[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:24.360]
Flea may know something about this.

[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:25.780]
You know about the Wonder Ground?

[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:26.560]
No, not really.

[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:27.540]
Oh.

[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.520]
Well, I asked, fake joy.

[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.100]
The new big thing now is tweeter.

[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.200]
Is what?

[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:34.540]
A lot tweeter.

[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:34.800]

[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.560]
Brown tweeter.

[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:36.020]
All right.

[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:37.900]
That's what somebody said.

[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.540]
Yeah, do somebody send me an email about it?

[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:41.740]
It's a new big thing.

[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:42.800]
How do you get on it?

[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.560]
You just go to tweeter.com.

[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:46.240]
Yeah.

[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:47.760]
And then you can track people.

[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:48.680]
People can track you.

[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.380]
You can give updates like what you're doing right now.

[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:51.780]
I don't know.

[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:52.840]
CNN has been all over it.

[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:56.040]
Like Anderson Cooper and those guys, they pimp it hard and it's like stocking it.

[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:57.340]
Really?

[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:58.340]
I don't know.

[00:52:58.420 --> 00:52:59.220]
They pimp it a lot.

[00:52:59.340 --> 00:52:59.740]
That's for sure.

[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.800]
Sounds real suspicious to me.

[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:02.580]
Mm-hmm.

[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.440]
When people like that start pimpin' stuff.

[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.000]
Anderson's Cooper?

[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:07.580]
Yeah.

[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.660]
Nothing could be neater.

[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:11.740]
I like her.

[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.800]
You like Anderson that...

[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:16.040]
Cooper?

[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.320]
I don't.

[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:17.600]
No.

[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.720]
Pasty and boring.

[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:21.020]
He is monotone, man.

[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.580]
He's as boring as the day.

[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:25.180]
He makes Rachel Maddo seem like a Mexican jumping bee.

[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.480]
Well, she's more manly.

[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:26.920]
That's for sure.

[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:29.900]
She's a lot more butch than he'll ever be.

[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.820]
Oy, Oy, Shmoi, you finally checked it.

[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:36.040]
I'm having trouble with my outlook expressed.

[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:36.820]
It's slow.

[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:41.360]
I mean, eventually I click on it and it comes up and then it disappears for a second.

[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:42.160]
But it'll come back.

[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:43.640]
Oh boy.

[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.100]
I agree.

[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:48.600]
Bruce Willis and Moll Gibson are right up there with that other no-tell and Bruce the Boss.

[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:52.240]
How do these does stay before the public so long Americans have no taste?

[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:54.720]
And it says no life here, Oy, Shmoi, you.

[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:55.740]
Oh, guess what?

[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:57.900]
Brandon says...

[00:53:58.580 --> 00:53:58.940]
99.

[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.720]
If you were born in...

[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.340]
That's what I said first and you, oh yeah.

[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.500]
Yeah, 99, yeah, he's right.

[00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:08.560]
Well, I said 99 and you corrected me.

[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:09.580]
No, you corrected yourself.

[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:10.000]
I agree.

[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:14.140]
I thought you were the expert in math because if Bob was born in 1910, my math show would be 99.

[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.260]
That's right, Brandon.

[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:16.920]
Yeah, you talked me out of it.

[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:17.260]
Sorry.

[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:18.580]
You are persuasive.

[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:19.520]
I'll take you to that, see.

[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:22.960]
Oh, Rich Pactors got a thing here about Ron St. John.

[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.160]
See, when you're on the show, it's all about radio.

[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.780]
It's not a radio show, it's a show about radio, which is fine.

[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:35.460]
Neil's still on the air and then he keeps doing a lot of voiceover work with TV spots with 1-800 numbers.

[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:40.500]
Whatever happened to Ron St. John Jr., you're looked with a peepy from Pepper Pines no doubt.

[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.240]
Also, please tell Flee for improving the stream.

[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:45.900]
I met you, Joe Bell.

[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.840]
It says insert prostate joke here.

[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:49.540]
Rich Pactors, thanks Rich.

[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.880]
He thanks you for improving the stream and the Joe Bell's stream also.

[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:53.800]
How did you do it?

[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:55.780]
The secret.

[00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:57.260]
Did you pry it open?

[00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:59.040]
Q-tip.

[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:04.580]
Oh, this is out right out.

[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.780]
This thing is so effed up, man.

[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:12.320]
If you had any idea what I'm going through to try to just delete stuff and go to the next one, it's just annoying.

[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.640]
It's annoying, Eric.

[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:15.640]
What the hell do I need to do?

[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.860]
My outlook expresses I have an nervous breakdown.

[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:18.600]
It's screwed up.

[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:19.640]
It's bad.

[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.560]
It's real, real bad.

[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:25.240]
Do you use that look expressed?

[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:26.020]
Yes, I do.

[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:29.000]
And now I won't even know there it is.

[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:31.000]
It's real slow today.

[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:31.660]
It's real slow.

[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:32.860]
Everything's like on slow cook.

[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.860]
Oh, here's one.

[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:38.820]
Please, thank Flee for making the breaks on the Internet progress.

[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:39.900]
It's being more appallable.

[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:45.000]
Also, I'd request you do some pro bono programming work up here in Daytona Beach.

[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:51.200]
The lead radio show in the afternoon other than Limbaugh and others of his ilk is a travel show that lasts for three hours.

[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:55.080]
Thank goodness for your show and the Internet's an XM when I'm on the road.

[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:55.660]
Says Rick.

[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:56.860]
Well, thanks Rick.

[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.820]
See, I find I got one or two people to say thanks to you for doing a thing there on the Internet's one or two.

[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.540]
Not like a whole flurry of like really grateful people.

[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:10.220]
I'm going to have to reboot my computer.

[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:13.600]
Is that that, huh?

[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:15.880]
It's slowed down to it's not just the allergy express.

[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:17.540]
Everything is slowed down to a crawl.

[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:21.000]
Which I never have that problem.

[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.980]
My computer is like lightning fast like grease lightning, man.

[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:27.520]
All right, let me read an email or two.

[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.960]
I can't get on nothing.

[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:30.480]
Oh, geez.

[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:34.200]
Receiving a list of messages from a server.

[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:36.080]
And I'll look at your press.

[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:38.980]
Maybe a kiss came back up.

[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.180]
You think maybe let me click on it.

[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.740]
Oh, geez, look at that.

[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:46.840]
It's a big blank screen.

[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.180]
Says the program's not responding.

[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:52.160]
I got to reboot it.

[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:52.920]
I got a little.

[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.420]
I got a little thing.

[00:56:55.760 --> 00:57:00.960]
Anyway, let me, this is from Bob who says due to my job, I've looked all over the country, listen to many radio stations.

[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:03.320]
QAM is by far the worst I have encountered.

[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:09.220]
Please tell me who on earth wants to do the horrific big O show two times today.

[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:10.420]
Well, you'll be pleased to know Bob.

[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:11.600]
He's only on once a day now.

[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.280]
You hear the sirens?

[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:14.380]
Oh, yeah.

[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.060]
They're coming from my computer.

[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:17.660]
Who is this guy?

[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.760]
And why should I be listening to his opinion on sports or any other topic for that matter?

[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.460]
And what's the point of the Joe Roe show?

[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:27.400]
Why would I want to listen to 50 minutes of commercials per hour and Joe screaming about nature be for the other 10 minutes?

[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.300]
Your show is the only one that's tolerable.

[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.580]
You obviously play less commercials and they actually have something to say.

[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.300]
George, on the other hand, is awful.

[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:39.380]
Who wants to hear about his roller skating, taking sign language classes and talking about smoking pot?

[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:41.520]
And no, he is not funny by any means.

[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.100]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:42.900]
Says Bob.

[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:44.620]
How do you like that?

[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:46.060]
The worst he's ever heard?

[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:46.920]
Wow.

[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.060]
Is that a, in a diet matter what?

[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:51.660]
That's not good.

[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:56.320]
Let me find what Larry thinks.

[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:57.400]
I'll find it.

[00:57:59.200 --> 00:57:59.920]
Hey, Larry.

[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:04.320]
Here it is.

[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:05.940]
I knew I'd find it.

[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.580]
The worst talk radio I've ever heard in my life with on W.O.D.

[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:09.340]
So there you go.

[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.200]
Well, this thing is just all screwed up.

[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:14.320]
It's all bald up, man.

[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:15.560]
It's all F'd up.

[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:20.060]
Let me just go back to the safety of Firefox.

[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.140]
Oh, hallelujah.

[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.080]
At least I can see the pool.

[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.180]
Not that I want to see it.

[00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.360]
But it's there anyway.

[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:25.860]
You know what I mean?

[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:28.720]
For my amusement and porousal during the break, I'll reboot.

[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:29.400]
Okay.

[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:30.660]
See what's going on.

[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:33.440]
Let's make sure we got the racing channel.

[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:37.460]
I'm not going to mess around with that first race from Gulf Stream because we don't have any vested interest in it.

[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.380]
Hey, no matter the surface.

[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:47.700]
Oh, there's the handicrafters from Fairgrounds, that goofy guy, Johnny, John G. Do, Do, do, whatever his name is.

[00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:50.540]
Who says, G, three, number, E, number two, number three.

[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:56.180]
He's got a very bizarre way of speaking, bizarre, strange, strange.

[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:56.840]
He's okay though.

[00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:00.760]
And she, she, she looks like she's in the bag today.

[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:02.920]
She looks like she just crawled out of the sack, whatever her name is.

[00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:03.320]
Nice.

[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.400]
But you can't get it there though.

[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:06.840]
You can't see the racing channel.

[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:07.840]
No, I'm watching CNN.

[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:10.200]
Oh, I'm going back to CNN myself.

[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.400]
Is there anything interesting on there?

[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:13.520]
Like is the world coming to winner of these the final days?

[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:14.780]
They're still talking about the track.

[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:17.040]
You're supposed to just spill his bag?

[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:18.700]
No, they're still on the plane crash.

[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:23.640]
Is Wolf a bit, I bet you're Wolf Blitzkrieg and Gary Sarner spend the weekends co-suring the house.

[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:23.960]
Oh.

[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.180]
Here's one from the big O allegedly.

[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:29.440]
Neil God.

[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:32.120]
My brother finally decided to come out of the closet.

[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:36.220]
It's a surprise to me in the rest of the family because he didn't look or act fruity at all.

[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:40.240]
At this time, the only thing I want to do is blow his brains out with my shotgun.

[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:43.980]
And I'm sure there's other solutions to this issue, but it's the only one that would make me feel better.

[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:48.540]
I don't have problems with guys who like to take it in the sacred area, but not my brother.

[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:53.220]
I know that you're an old disgusting fag, but I want to hear your opinion on this one.

[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.060]
You're as truly the big O.

[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:57.480]
But I would do is get the shotgun out and blow your own brains out if you can find him.

[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.480]
Stick it deep inside your go and blow your brains out.

[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.760]
Then you'll solve everybody's problem, including your poor brother.

[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.900]
Not that that would be fake or anything like that.

[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.020]
Let me try a click and outlook and express you know what happens?

[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.580]
Click it.

[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:13.360]
Nothing.

[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.880]
Oh, it's just all bald up.

[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:18.860]
It just all frozen up in the space.

[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.500]
You know what I mean?

[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:21.120]
Yep.

[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.580]
Do you ever have that happen where your computer gets like in.

[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.680]
Oh, look at that.

[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.860]
Looky, looky, here comes cookie as Winery would say.

[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.400]
And now I can't even go back to my Firefox.

[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.360]
Oh, there it is.

[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.960]
And the good news is we're streaming, baby.

[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.740]
No, no, no, dropouts today.

[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:42.180]
Yesterday we had a little problem with the Texas server for a while, like two hours.

[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.160]
But not a whole lot of complaints.

[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:49.380]
So I guess most of our audience is served by the California server, which makes no sense to me at all.

[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:50.880]
And then Alice Rantell was belly.

[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.000]
Oh, geez.

[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.220]
I got news for you.

[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:58.000]
Anybody I know in this business who is sitting around listening to this show every day, get yourself, get a hobby.

[01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:59.320]
Take up stamp collecting.

[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:01.940]
Go out and move something with Sarah.

[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:02.900]
Do something useful.

[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:04.200]
Am I right?

[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:05.060]
Yes.

[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.300]
I mean, you're a radio guy.

[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.300]
You spent a lot of years in this horrible ass kissing business.

[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.660]
But my God, in your spare time, you sit around listening to radio.

[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:14.580]
Absolutely not.

[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:17.220]
Absolutely positively not.

[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:19.840]
God.

[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.420]
Oh, but we love Newer.

[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:23.280]
Yeah, well, good.

[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:24.420]
I'm happy for you.

[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:25.880]
Love somebody else.

[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:27.520]
Like Vincent said, Godfather 3.

[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.820]
Love somebody else.

[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.020]
That's what he told Mary.

[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:31.840]
And then Mary said,

[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:33.600]
Dead, dead.

[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.000]
Did you see Godfather 3?

[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:35.760]
Yeah, of course.

[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.160]
What do you mean, of course?

[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.900]
I would assume everybody has.

[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.160]
Although Alice and who used to work here, she never saw the original Godfather.

[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.700]
Oh, my God.

[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:49.880]
I bet she's being Jewish.

[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.660]
She probably would have appreciated Heim and Roth.

[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:52.460]
Sure.

[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.500]
I mean, she still has her own Heim and Roth.

[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:58.840]
She still has her own Heim and what?

[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.140]
913 votes.

[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.980]
Well, you sure get personal, but you won't tell us about Joe Bell's feedback.

[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:04.880]
That's disappointing.

[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.980]
The best way to describe my sponsor is significant.

[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.720]
Other is that's our poll 913 votes.

[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.280]
My best friend, 212.

[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.220]
You're my friend.

[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.380]
212 vote.

[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:15.680]
Don't have one 197.

[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.440]
My soulmate 141.

[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:18.960]
Fantastic 67.

[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:20.300]
Ballbuster 58.

[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:21.720]
Ball and chain 56.

[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:22.500]
Total bitch 45.

[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:24.480]
History 836.

[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.880]
Hot 32.

[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:27.140]
Gorgeous 21.

[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:28.320]
Fat 19.

[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.500]
Slot 17.

[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.660]
Bloodsucker 12.

[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:32.300]
Out of 913.

[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:34.080]
I'm going to do some of computer work now.

[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.220]
Lunatic.

[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.220]
It's Friday.

[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:37.600]
You're wasting.

[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.000]
The long hours here.

[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:39.860]
Long hours here.

[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.480]
Interrupting my compliment.

[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:42.980]
Oh, thank you.

[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.660]
That's what, what was that compliment?

[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.440]
You look absolutely beautiful.

[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.480]
Advice for the new president from 1718.

[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.340]
You're a genius.

[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:53.380]
You're a genius.

[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.380]
You're a genius.

[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.700]
How are you getting it tonight?

[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.840]
The books so long with books are good.

[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.980]
I took off my socks and I was very peaking functional.

[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.020]
I love it.

[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.940]
She can take it from me.

[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:11.360]
I have first one with the president and say on tape, right there.

[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.420]
Everybody, it's it is back to work here in DC.

[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:15.960]
Yes.

[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.260]
The kids, of course.

[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.400]
No, that's right.

[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.660]
They're all school today.

[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:25.100]
And I know Sam and Chris, you both know that they have the scavenger hunt last night and

[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:28.320]
they got to open the door in the Jonas Brothers right there.

[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.100]
That may be the only thing that's going to happen.

[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:31.580]
All right.

[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:32.360]
Hey, Joey.

[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.260]
Okay, 1131.

[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:35.580]
What do you know about the Jonas Brothers?

[01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:36.420]
Probably not much.

[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.620]
I know that they're bad.

[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:39.820]
They can't sing.

[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:40.120]
No.

[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:44.840]
And you'll be very proud of me that during the break-eye, rebooted and everything is just fine.

[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:46.460]
Oh, we're fine.

[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:46.660]
Right.

[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:48.580]
Everything's working just up to normal speed and all.

[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:53.700]
So when you have those computer farts like that, the best thing to do is always reboot.

[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.460]
When in doubt.

[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.860]
I'm telling you right now, I'm smelling you.

[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:01.600]
Which race are you betting on a costume today?

[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.200]
Race one at 115.

[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.520]
We don't do race one.

[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.480]
We always do race two at 145.

[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:12.360]
Since I work on the Internet selling bongs, I was on the Gulf Stream side trend learn more about this horse racing mumbo jumbo.

[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:15.400]
It says, can you tell me the horse's name you're picking for art?

[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.240]
Mon again, please.

[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.080]
The horse's name is Columbia number four.

[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.460]
Hey, tell flea two for five, Mon big bags.

[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.220]
Next week I will not be listening since you're going on vacation.

[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.200]
Where will you go?

[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:27.080]
How will the show survive?

[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:28.360]
Is there no hope for Q.I.M.?

[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.860]
Thanks for getting us all through another week of a Madness Mon.

[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:34.120]
Take us how you take it.

[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:34.940]
Rostapal.

[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.780]
Take it how you take it.

[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.500]
Yeah, take this.

[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:39.840]
Rostapal.

[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:40.660]
My ass.

[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.960]
This still does some strange things though.

[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:48.300]
This, um, outlook express.

[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.440]
I think outlook expresses screwing up my computer.

[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.480]
I could be wrong about that.

[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:52.960]
Wouldn't that be unusual?

[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:53.460]
Yeah.

[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:59.360]
Is not looking express pretty like, um, mundane pristine kind of like Joe's pee bag.

[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.400]
Clean and pristine.

[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.720]
I don't know why you see nervous laugh.

[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.220]
I think you're afraid to go there.

[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.760]
I don't know that he has a pee bag.

[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.320]
Well, why would somebody make that up?

[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:10.940]
I don't know.

[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.760]
I mean, it's probably Mark Hockmeister across the street.

[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:14.980]
Rosemary Homoister, Jr.

[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:17.260]
Hockman's okay.

[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:17.260]

[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:18.740]
Hockman's okay.

[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:19.740]
You know him?

[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:20.380]
I've met him yet.

[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:22.100]
You know, that's really interesting.

[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:24.280]
You're just like all the others.

[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:24.620]
No.

[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.040]
I mean, I want to be.

[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.980]
It's not a radio station.

[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:28.500]
It's not a business.

[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.680]
It's a sports nerd for eternity.

[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.200]
No, I disagree.

[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:35.240]
I can think that the guy is an okay guy, but I still hate his guts and want that station to go down the tubes.

[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.000]
Well, they're doing a good job of that.

[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:39.320]
Most of their numbers start with either a one.

[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.320]
Although I don't think that there is successful as we are in that category.

[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.320]
We got one hour, nine o'clock at night.

[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.220]
That's got a point.

[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:50.160]
Oh, I mean, can you believe that?

[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:50.420]
No.

[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:51.800]
I've never seen that before in my life.

[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:58.040]
I've seen it like overnight and stuff like that, but not, you know, like before midnight when some people might still be awake.

[01:05:59.080 --> 01:05:59.720]
No diaries.

[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:00.700]
Nobody's listening.

[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:01.020]
Oh.

[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:01.320]
Point.

[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:02.020]
Oh, wow.

[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.740]
And of course, we can go on all of the signals.

[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:05.340]
It's the signal.

[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.740]
Well, you know, that can be a part of it.

[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.440]
I remember when I was at W.S. News.

[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.540]
Nice to do eight to midnight.

[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:15.960]
And Fidel cranked up on 790, which used to be WNWS.

[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:17.500]
Now, of course, it's, oh, them.

[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.880]
But Fidel cranked up one of the luck he did on us here.

[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.280]
Maybe he just follows me around.

[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:27.480]
And in any rate, I mean, our nighttime signal became just pathetic.

[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.460]
And I still had like an eight share at night.

[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.020]
12 plus eight share.

[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:32.440]
Wow.

[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:33.380]
Yeah.

[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:36.400]
Well, back in the day, those days, people used to listen to the radio at night.

[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.540]
We used to have gigantic humongous numbers back before they put that turn.

[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:45.200]
And then W.S. News got, I think, 25,000 or 10,000 watts daytime and whatever.

[01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:47.120]
25,000 night.

[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:50.300]
And we cranked up our signal.

[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:52.080]
And then we got the numbers back up.

[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.800]
But we used to have like 10 and 11 shares at night.

[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:55.400]
12 plus.

[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.820]
Granted, they were all over the age of 100, but nevertheless.

[01:06:59.200 --> 01:06:59.600]
WNWS.

[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:00.920]
W.S. News, baby.

[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:02.220]
Alice Rantell.

[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:03.220]
Shirley Tweeters.

[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.940]
Jerry Wichner, Steve Mystery Gokane.

[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.280]
Stan Major.

[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:10.180]
What's his name?

[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.060]
Dale God.

[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:11.580]
Oh, yeah.

[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.120]
Mike Spindell.

[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.700]
I wonder if Mike Spindell ever did trivia, I guess he did.

[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:16.760]

[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:17.260]
I forget.

[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:18.480]
You wouldn't know.

[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:19.020]
Nope.

[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:20.600]
And he's with George.

[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.280]
He wouldn't know either.

[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:23.340]
I asked the other day about WNWS.

[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.780]
I didn't get one email about it.

[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:25.320]
None.

[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:27.020]
Nothing.

[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.940]
Those people are all dead.

[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:30.180]
They're like Bob Shepard.

[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:30.920]
99.

[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.320]
How can it be 99 and still be working?

[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.540]
That's the obvious question.

[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.040]
I don't know.

[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:38.400]
Did they like take him up there like in a box?

[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:41.240]
I mean, how do you go to the press box in a box?

[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:44.740]
Oh, by the way, I guess you called me yesterday to congratulate me on my promotion.

[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:45.060]
How many of you guys do I get?

[01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:45.760]
You get one.

[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:47.400]
He called you what?

[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.480]
He called me because he heard on your show that I got promoted to APD.

[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.340]
If that's really a promotion, but I guess who it was.

[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:55.500]
You done?

[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:56.500]
Joey Reynolds.

[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:57.560]
No, the close.

[01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:58.600]
Ken Maldon.

[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:01.000]
Ken Maldon.

[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:01.820]
Oh.

[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:03.880]
Well, when do you mean close?

[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:06.980]
I say, Joey Reynolds, and you say you're close, and you say Ken Maldon.

[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:07.720]
What a shot.

[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:09.900]
Poor Kenny's down and out, and you're taking a shot at him.

[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:10.540]
Kenny's great.

[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.520]
I'm messing around the building.

[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:11.940]
Yeah.

[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:15.300]
Well, he sent me a nice, so thank you, Kurt, for all the nice things I said about him.

[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.680]
And I repeat them and emphatically emphasize.

[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.440]
Well, that's your buddy, Joe Bell, that they didn't have to screw him over.

[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:25.660]
The amount of money he was making, my God, they could go out there and beg on a street corner

[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.280]
for change and pay Kenny.

[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.100]
Keep him on the air, keep him employed, and keep him alive.

[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:33.200]
But no, not you're a pee bag holding guy.

[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.600]
I believe that about the pee bag.

[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.900]
Maybe that's why he's pissed off all the time.

[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.740]
He's a very temperamental guy.

[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.440]
You do know that.

[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.240]
Really?

[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.100]
That's what I've been told.

[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:46.860]
That's what Tom Jicke told me.

[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:51.360]
He said, what a temperamental A-hole that Joe Bell hung up on.

[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:53.140]
Wow, I've only seen a mad one for twice.

[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:53.800]
Really?

[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:54.160]
Yeah.

[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:56.920]
Well, that's because you're so pleasant, you know.

[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:57.500]
That's true.

[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.580]
Neil at NeilRodges.com by the email, by the way.

[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.840]
Don't keep saying, by the way, that's bad.

[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.720]
Bad habit to get into.

[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.900]
I say it all the way, by the way.

[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.180]
You want to say it?

[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:08.960]
By the way.

[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:10.000]
Go ahead.

[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.600]
923 votes on the poll.

[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:16.300]
Should I change it?

[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.040]
I don't really like it.

[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:18.260]
If we got the next one on there.

[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.160]
Yeah, this is the next one.

[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:19.260]
Oh, yeah.

[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.060]
What? This one's a little lame.

[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.240]
The next one, you think this one's lame.

[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:24.260]
Wait till you see the next one.

[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.220]
Okay, let me print out this one.

[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.260]
I'll give you the final tally.

[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.600]
Wait till you see the next one.

[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:32.640]
Which one of these one-named people disturb you the most?

[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:34.040]
Not the name, but the people.

[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.040]
Which one of these one-named people disturb?

[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:42.940]
Puffy, Prince, Pink, Sting, Cher, Seal, Bono, Madonna, or Eminem?

[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.920]
Which one disturbs you the most?

[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.520]
Puffy disturbs the hell out of me.

[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:50.620]
He just, he just drives me up the wall.

[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:54.080]
No matter how much of a slimeball he turns out to be,

[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.340]
he's always got some of the scam going on, you know?

[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.740]
He's one of those people who will never go away.

[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:02.400]
So I told you, if you think the other pool sucked,

[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.260]
wait till you hear this one.

[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:03.700]
I was right.

[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.060]
Yeah.

[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:08.540]
Now, I also think, by the way, since you're the assistant PD

[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:10.600]
and promotions guy, you ought to take this,

[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.100]
pick the pony thing by the tail.

[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:12.800]
Okay.

[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.200]
We have no promotion for it.

[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:16.760]
We have no liners to read about.

[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:19.120]
Well, there's liners being read just outside of your show.

[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.880]
I can put some inside your show if you'd like.

[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.760]
But outside of your show, yeah, we read a lot of liners.

[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.420]
It's also on the streaming and it's getting promoted.

[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.100]
Okay.

[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:27.940]
Well, we got art today.

[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.060]
Art's got to four horse in the second race of Gulf Stream.

[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.120]
50 bucks to win on it.

[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:31.640]
Nice.

[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.080]
And if a win, he gets whatever $50 to win ticket would pay.

[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:36.300]
And if we lose, well, we send him our best wishes.

[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.680]
Yeah, last week it was like $150.

[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:38.660]
Yeah.

[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:39.160]
Nice.

[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.160]
Oh, what's a big deal with that?

[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:40.700]
Two to one?

[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:41.440]
Hey, I'll take it.

[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.340]
I think this one's going to be more than two to one.

[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.480]
He's five to one in a morning line.

[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:49.640]
And we just claimed after the last start.

[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:51.360]
Second time, Lasix.

[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.340]
Look out now.

[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.320]
Of course, also second time, Lasix on the horse that beat him in that race.

[01:10:55.620 --> 01:11:04.420]
But this horse had an excuse, steadied in the backstretch, steadied, checked, pulled up, did not finish,

[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.440]
bled, stuff like that.

[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.460]
That's not conducive to winning the race.

[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:12.960]
And the rate Jose Luscano was riding.

[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:14.420]
I wonder what he looks like.

[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:15.380]
Okay.

[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:15.960]
Here's the poll.

[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.860]
The best way to describe my sponsor is significant.

[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:20.000]
Other is 924 vote.

[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.140]
My best friend, 214.

[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.040]
Walk up to him tomorrow and say, him or her or it, you're my friend.

[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.280]
Don't have one, $199.

[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:30.060]
Don't you miss the calls, by the way?

[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.200]
Sure.

[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:32.800]
I don't.

[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.040]
No.

[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.120]
I haven't taken any a long time and you know what I'm very happy about it.

[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.120]
I'm proud, proud of myself.

[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.000]
Because George could tell you, I started the thing with no calls so many times.

[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.480]
Then I always being the weak sister that I am.

[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:48.700]
Always bending cave and you know, oh gee, I guess we got it.

[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:50.220]
And then it's all the same crap.

[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:57.360]
My soulmate 142, fantastic 70, ballbuster 58, ball and chain 57,

[01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:03.500]
total bitch 46, history 36, hot 32, gorgeous 21, fat 19,

[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.300]
slut 18 and blood sucker 12.

[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:10.140]
Oh, Niels, it's Friday, you bastards.

[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.920]
Toiletoy toiletoy.

[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:20.700]
Joe is days I've done.

[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:21.640]
Absolutely.

[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.100]
Joe is days I've done.

[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:29.220]
The martial is his son.

[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:33.180]
The show just ain't no fun.

[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:34.080]
No.

[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:41.800]
So what does Karen Bruce think Joey is gonna do?

[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:45.500]
He taught us how we can get it.

[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:48.200]
And now we're calling on the page.

[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:57.300]
The ratings they reflected no wonder we directed his battle to crawl away.

[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:04.380]
Joe is got a gun.

[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.620]
Joe is got a gun.

[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.880]
Neil can't help this one.

[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:13.920]
No.

[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:16.900]
Maybe your days are done.

[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:21.080]
What is it gonna do?

[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.360]
Is waitio days are through.

[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.980]
You try to smile we can get it.

[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:31.540]
And now we're calling on the page.

[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:38.600]
The ratings they reflected no wonder we directed his battle to crawl away.

[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.180]
You try to crawl away and shake.

[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:50.500]
Run away from the page.

[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:53.120]
You're fair.

[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.720]
Run away from the page.

[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:04.980]
147 and 560.

[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.140]
I'm going to chew on what it just made.

[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:18.200]
Did you ever meet Joey?

[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:19.800]
No, I lost you for a second.

[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:20.320]
I couldn't hear you.

[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.340]
You just came back.

[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:23.440]
What?

[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:25.240]
Like I couldn't hear you for a second.

[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:26.740]
It was weird.

[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.460]
We have an audio fart.

[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:31.200]
I think we did.

[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:33.860]
All my lights are on.

[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.540]
Everything seems to be copacetic here.

[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:36.540]
Yeah, that was strange.

[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:39.660]
Well, of course you'd never know.

[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:40.820]
I could just shut the mic off.

[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:42.740]
And you'd never know.

[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:43.160]
That's true.

[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:52.460]
This one is just scandalous if it's from the person John Ford who used to work with

[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:54.020]
us on Zeta, me and the burden Capita.

[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.060]
And we had that morning show, that legendary morning show.

[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:03.500]
And then when I would be got sold and we went over to Paxton, come to find out that

[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.400]
he was like the production guy or something there.

[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.780]
And he never ever came around.

[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:10.840]
In fact, I remember I had to say to PD Bulger, what's with John Ford?

[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.740]
I worked with him and then come to find out he hated me like poison.

[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:19.020]
And I guess because I was, he had a little problem with that.

[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:19.300]
Wow.

[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.560]
Believe me when you're as ugly as John Ford, you don't have to worry about some fat coming

[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.000]
on to you.

[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:23.340]
You know what I mean?

[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:28.400]
But he had had some kind of a problem with queens like Chester Field Queens.

[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:35.540]
And so at one point, the PD Bulger brought him around to say hi and he, you know, and

[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:36.100]
then he ran away.

[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.720]
This is from John Ford, subject WNWS.

[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:44.120]
It says I used to listen to you on WS News driving home from work after my shift on

[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:44.380]
she.

[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:47.660]
So it's got to be that John Ford because it's somebody in the business.

[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:48.600]
Do you know John Ford?

[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:49.380]
No.

[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.380]
But how many John Ford's could there be in a South Florida radio market, right?

[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:53.040]
And they won.

[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:54.020]
So lamenté uno.

[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.140]
So lamenté soltanto uno.

[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:58.360]
Wow.

[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:02.020]
And he's still listening now, even though he's got maybe, maybe he doesn't have that repulsion

[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:02.800]
for me anymore.

[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:03.220]
I don't know.

[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.080]
Well, maybe he does.

[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.140]
I wonder if all the people in the market, I mean, March 1 is going to be 33 years I've

[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:11.260]
been on the air in Miami.

[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:15.920]
33 years in Miami.

[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:17.560]
And like 12 on this station, right?

[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:21.400]
Yeah.

[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.120]
Yeah, but that won't be March 1.

[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.460]
That will be December 30th.

[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:29.920]
Oh, December 30th, which is when I told Greg Reed, either will be on the year on QAM December

[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.660]
30th around some other station when he kept giving me this, oh, well, we won't have the

[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:34.660]
studio ready by then.

[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:38.880]
And Baba, oh, you have no idea what we went through to try to get on the station because

[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:39.960]
they lie a lot.

[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:41.680]
They lie in radio.

[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.280]
What?

[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.660]
Oh my God.

[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:44.520]
These people lie.

[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.720]
It's their middle name.

[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:47.200]
Lyres, be us.

[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:52.460]
And the word going around was because they were back in the old studio by the trailer parking

[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:53.240]
a whole thing in Hollywood.

[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:54.120]
Oh, yeah.

[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.100]
Oh, Neil has to do the show from a phone booth.

[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.040]
He'll have to do it because, you know, yada, yada, yada.

[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:04.000]
See, the one thing about Greg Reed, he figured he could just tell you anything you'd want to

[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:04.200]
hear.

[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.640]
And then nobody would ever hold his feet to the fire and make them, you know, because

[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:14.060]
these people's concept of a contractual relationship is they pay you money and then that's it.

[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.720]
You do everything else.

[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:17.720]
You do the show.

[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:18.720]
You provide the numbers.

[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:19.720]
You buy your own equipment.

[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:20.240]
You do whatever.

[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:23.940]
And then they just pay you a salary no matter what it says in the contract, the rest of

[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:26.460]
it, they just pay no attention to like promotion and stuff like that.

[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:31.940]
So they, they sure live with a horseshoe up their asses.

[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:32.640]
They're collecting ass.

[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:33.260]
I'll tell you that.

[01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:33.620]
Wow.

[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:34.920]
They do.

[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:38.460]
How'd you like to walk around with a horseshoe up your ass all day?

[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:39.100]
No, thanks.

[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:40.760]
42 votes on the new pool.

[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:43.140]
Which of these one name people disturb you the most?

[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.580]
I think we ought to add WTF on here.

[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:46.520]
You up to it?

[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:46.940]
Sure.

[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:47.880]
I got it.

[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:53.880]
WTF, Puffy 23, MNM5, Madonna 5, Prince 5, SEAL 2.

[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:54.520]
Who's SEAL?

[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:55.320]
I don't even know who that is.

[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:55.960]
He's a singer.

[01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:57.160]
Is he?

[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:57.580]
Yeah.

[01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:58.740]
SEAL?

[01:17:59.020 --> 01:17:59.300]
Yeah.

[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.980]
He's a, I forget the big hit.

[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.120]
He had one huge hit.

[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:04.440]
Crazy.

[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:06.120]
Crazy.

[01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:06.640]
Yeah.

[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:07.840]
A little bit crazy.

[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.700]
And he's a super model to him.

[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:10.540]
I don't know who he is.

[01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:11.520]
Sting one.

[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.280]
Pink one.

[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.480]
Bona and Sheer.

[01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:17.880]
Nothing.

[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:21.200]
I'll lay a great black for farmers, but then again, great.

[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.940]
Which this era, I like reanages fine.

[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:25.040]
Oh yeah, she's good.

[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:25.840]
How's Chris Brown doing?

[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:26.940]
Is he still in the slimer?

[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:28.540]
Not so good people are dropping his songs.

[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:29.940]
Like across the country too.

[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:30.360]
I don't know.

[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:32.280]
I don't know.

[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:36.040]
I'll just because you got a little bit hostile enough set.

[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.060]
Yeah, what's the big deal?

[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.180]
Just because you got a little bit carried away.

[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:41.500]
I don't know.

[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:41.500]

[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:41.500]

[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:41.500]

[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:41.500]

[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:45.140]
I mean, he didn't do no roids like a payroid.

[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:46.720]
You know, that we know of.

[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:48.600]
Probably other drugs though.

[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.000]
A bono and Sheer have no votes.

[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:53.720]
I mean, what would anybody be disturbed by them?

[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:54.720]
Bono's got one now.

[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.600]
You voted for him?

[01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:57.720]
No, I voted for Puffy.

[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.220]
Love will turn you around says this.

[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.440]
Oh, Kenny Rogers.

[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:04.880]
The Kenny Rogers.

[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:07.460]
Now, what's the story?

[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:10.220]
The Kenny Rogers that got candy across the street once he's starting with us?

[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:10.800]
I don't know.

[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:11.600]
He was here the other day.

[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:12.360]
He was?

[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:12.780]
Yeah.

[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.140]
I don't think he's starting though.

[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:16.240]
He came in with clearance.

[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.040]
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.500]
If they fail across the street, sign them up.

[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:22.220]
Is that the motto?

[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:23.120]
Yeah, Jerks.

[01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:24.100]
I don't think it's happening though.

[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:25.020]
Like Jerks.

[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.300]
Oh my god.

[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.000]
Come and act ya!

[01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:30.580]
That was the worst swill.

[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:31.060]
Horrible.

[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.880]
In fact, we had to get some emails on that.

[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.740]
What was the worst show ever on QAM?

[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:36.360]
That's okay.

[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:38.940]
Jerks?

[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:40.220]
Yeah, that was bad.

[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:43.320]
Just wondered if you and Flea were doing anything special for Valentine's Day.

[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:44.380]
Oh yeah, we're going out.

[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:47.040]
I'm sure the audience would love to hear about it.

[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:51.160]
I've seen Neil sitting in front of a machine, being fed trebles by Paco.

[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:54.340]
I see Flea pumping down...

[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:56.100]
Yeah?

[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:56.700]
One?

[01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:00.860]
Seafleo pimping skanks down on Flagler.

[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:01.660]
I thought it said pumping.

[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:02.460]
It says pimping.

[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:03.240]
Well, either one.

[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:06.200]
I haven't heard any emails from Brandon and they were as he had.

[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:06.900]
We had a couple.

[01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:07.420]
Just relax.

[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.760]
Hope the Marlins get that sitting by the way the Kenny Rogers.

[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:11.760]
Yeah, well, you're the one.

[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.920]
Because everybody else says no way Jose.

[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:18.500]
Kenny says it's a different Kenny.

[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:21.760]
I haven't heard it ever, but I know a lot of people find her disturbing or annoying.

[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:22.540]
Bjork.

[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:24.480]
BG-O-R-K.

[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:26.060]
Can we say BG-O-R-K?

[01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:26.400]
Bjork.

[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:27.640]
Get her on there.

[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:27.980]
Okay.

[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:28.680]
Bjork.

[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:29.720]
One for the pool.

[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.320]
David says, oh, New York City, Dave.

[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.860]
Oh, RuPaul is not one name.

[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:37.740]
It's two names.

[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:39.060]
Am I right?

[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.720]
It is one name, actually.

[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:45.560]
Are you sure?

[01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:47.220]
Pretty sure.

[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.340]
I don't think so.

[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.920]
That's a...are you capital P?

[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.460]
It's all...okay, put it on there if you want.

[01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:58.340]
I don't mean to be chronic.

[01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:58.840]
Forgive me.

[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.120]
I'll be jury doing next week.

[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:02.460]
I'll be on vacation so that don't do me any good.

[01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:03.460]
New York City, Dave.

[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:05.320]
Just on and on and on.

[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:07.400]
Penny says, what's up with the Randy Roadshow?

[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:11.500]
There's a guest host, but all the sponsor PSAs like Smokey Bear and Save a Tree.

[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:12.560]
How do they pay the bills?

[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:12.980]
I don't know.

[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:14.240]
Nobody knows what's going on with that.

[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:18.000]
She's off the year for some mysterious reason and nobody knows why.

[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:21.280]
Allegedly, some technical reason, but nobody knows why.

[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:23.420]
Sounds really bogus to me.

[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.980]
Maybe they're hiding her somewhere in...

[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:25.140]
Where?

[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.060]
I don't know.

[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.400]
Here's one that says, was thinking the same thing.

[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:33.400]
Whatever the same thing is.

[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.480]
Well, you know, these are out of order.

[01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:38.340]
Is there any chance you could extend your show to win the three?

[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:40.300]
There's nothing to listen to from two to three.

[01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:42.680]
Also, the Labaster Show is very well produced.

[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:45.460]
If not for a Hawkman, it would be just another mediocre show.

[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:46.240]
Would you agree with that?

[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.420]
If not for Hawkman?

[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:49.160]
Hmm.

[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:50.240]
I don't know.

[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:56.060]
All of a sudden, he's become Mr. Non-Committal.

[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.160]
I'll put it till this moment, you were blurting everything out.

[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.860]
I hate Gary Sarner, he's an A-hole.

[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:01.420]
You know, everything.

[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.100]
But now all of a sudden, I mean...

[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:04.460]
Well, I don't know how much he does for the show.

[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:04.860]
I don't know.

[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.360]
Well, you must listen every day religiously.

[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:07.800]
Yeah.

[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:10.720]
That's what people...

[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:11.820]
That's what these people think.

[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.760]
They think that because we are in radio or at least close to it,

[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:16.920]
that that's what we do all the time.

[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:21.580]
Listen to radio shows and critique them and laugh at them and bitch at them and whatever.

[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:22.580]
Enjoy them.

[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.260]
Enjoy the opposite.

[01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:26.520]
Like, when I get in my car, I put my iPod in, I don't want to listen to local radio.

[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:27.000]
Exactly.

[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:32.760]
My God, the idea that I would listen to a talk show, the only show I watch,

[01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:35.460]
I don't listen to it when I watch it because it's a Simulcast on TV.

[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:38.280]
I watch Bob Witt's name here, the sports guy.

[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:40.300]
It's been on for 30 some years in Toronto.

[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:40.780]
He's great.

[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:42.180]
Bob on the fan.

[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.340]
They Simulcast it on Primetime Sports.

[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:46.740]
Bob...

[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:48.400]
I can never think of his name for some reason.

[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.440]
But I'll come up with it for you.

[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:52.800]
Great broadcaster.

[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:56.060]
And then, of course, there are times they start talking about, like,

[01:22:56.060 --> 01:23:00.740]
soccer or the actors and then at that point I just go away.

[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.860]
Because no matter how good he is, I don't care about those things,

[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.060]
it's called nero caster.

[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:06.840]
Oh, Neil!

[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.180]
This is Brady Quinn.

[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:13.340]
Whenever I shape my balls, I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-4-1 hour.

[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:16.920]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la...

[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:17.120]
No.

[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.820]
Time great, out.

[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.240]
I want some Quinn.

[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:26.700]
You ain't seen no head white like lady with

[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:31.220]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la

[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:36.140]
He's a football player, you do a solid wall of meat

[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:40.860]
The kind of guy that I wanna do, that's who he built to eat

[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:45.920]
I want to give him the one a day, but there's no chance at all

[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:48.540]
So does the big meal sports quit?

[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.700]
If I want to see him grab the balls

[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:51.420]
Absolutely

[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:59.660]
You ain't seen no head white like lady with

[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:05.380]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

[01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:09.320]
I got a high deputy screen that helps me see his bones

[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:14.160]
I can do love I wanna, but I ain't gonna never get none

[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:18.640]
No, the days of a business school, okay, that's not so great

[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.500]
But I'll go to know that it's not neat

[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.260]
At least until he's 28

[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:25.700]
I'm braiding down

[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:28.320]
I want some wings

[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:32.520]
You ain't seen no head white like lady with

[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.360]
You're fair

[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.140]
Oh, lady, wow

[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:37.540]
Look at that kid

[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:42.100]
You ain't seen no head white like lady with

[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:46.600]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:49.400]
Double one at five sixty WM happy Friday to you

[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:52.060]
Happy Valentine's day to all the Valentine's out here

[01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:56.220]
Lots of chocolates, lots of flowers, lots of...

[01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:57.260]
All of these things

[01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:57.600]
Stuff

[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:01.940]
Wait till you're this one from Murray, okay?

[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.760]
There is no comparison between flea and George

[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:08.680]
Flea is much more engaged in part of the show

[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:11.180]
I think George does a very good job at producing the show

[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:14.160]
But he sounds bored, V-O-A-R-D

[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:17.040]
He sounds bored and totally disinterested

[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:18.800]
With a very phony laugh

[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:22.040]
You're always entertaining, you're never better and never stale

[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:23.780]
I hope you have a great vacation, Neil Murray

[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:24.500]
Thanks, Murray

[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:26.660]
He's kissing everybody's ass except George

[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.560]
Although he even George, he said, there's a great job producing the show

[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:30.280]
What does that mean?

[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:31.280]
I'm not sure

[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:33.280]
He plays the spots when they're supposed to, I mean

[01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:36.460]
But what does that mean?

[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:37.260]
I don't know

[01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:38.640]
And by the way, I did look up seal

[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.920]
Oh my God, you talk about you, Glee, wow

[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.520]
Yeah, do you look at his wife?

[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:43.500]
No

[01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:44.840]
He's married to Heidi Klum

[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:48.120]
Yeah, I know that, that's what it says in this email

[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.200]
Well, she's hot

[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:50.440]
Is she really?

[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:50.680]
Oh

[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:53.200]
Well, he must have something that don't meet the eye

[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:53.780]
I guess

[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.860]
Ronnie says you have to know who seal is one of his big hits was

[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.580]
Kiss from a Rose, never heard of it

[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:00.560]
Kiss from a Rose

[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:01.920]
Kiss from Joe Rose?

[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.600]
How you doing with the ladies?

[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.300]
The lady, he's just, I don't know

[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.820]
He is what he is, I like Joe a lot

[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.020]
But he is, you know

[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.320]
The ladies

[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:15.600]
The biggest claim to fame is that somehow he managed to get Heidi Klum to marry him

[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.780]
He's the ugliest and luckyest bastard in the world to his Ronnie

[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:18.600]
Thanks Ronnie

[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.360]
Ronnie inspired me to look it up online

[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:23.740]
I looked at his push and I thought, oh man, I thought I was ugly, which I am

[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:25.580]
But not even in that category

[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:27.840]
No, he's a whole other level of ugly

[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:32.580]
Norma Kent sends an email

[01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:36.320]
Hello my most valued and trusted client to fake Norma Kent

[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.340]
Norma Kent

[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:39.700]
Some spy reports

[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:44.280]
Gary Bruce is now a sales manager at a Home Depot in Louisville, Kentucky

[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:46.760]
He's been in this position since 2002

[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:49.500]
I know you don't do links but in this case you want a good laugh

[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.580]
Plus to see what a deep bag looks like now, his resume is here

[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:54.800]
I will take your word for it

[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:57.960]
Mark Jacobson is unfortunately alive and well in striving in

[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.020]
Surprise, surprise, rolling North Carolina

[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:03.000]
Wow, just when Jolly Jo and his entourage moved out

[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.460]
Mark Jacobson moved in

[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.140]
He's got his dealerships and a whole bunch of got awful commercial's featuring

[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:11.380]
Mark dressed up to the nines and holding puppies who are also dressed up

[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:13.920]
and who've been clearly drug to the point of nearly being put to sleep

[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:18.400]
I wonder if he has a talk show North Carolina Public Assess up there

[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.320]
May the Marlins drop dead Norma Kent

[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:23.200]
I better check the Marlins, the, uh, Harold thing

[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.240]
What time are they voting?

[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:27.560]
Do we know?

[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:29.380]
They said it could drag on all day

[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:30.960]
Oh boy

[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:34.940]
Mayor pushes Marlins stadium before crucial vote

[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:37.560]
Well, while hubbim and dread many DS

[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:44.320]
Anybody that wants to take tax money and help build a stadium for the freaking Marlins

[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.340]
of which the interest is minimal to nonexistent

[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:49.020]
While the teachers are getting a screwdriver

[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:50.560]
Shame on you

[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:52.780]
Shame on you

[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:56.120]
Many DS and others

[01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:59.340]
Oh look at this live, watch the commission meeting

[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.660]
It's going on now we could put it on the air

[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:03.540]
Wow wouldn't that be exciting?

[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.040]
Riveting

[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:06.840]
In his opening statement

[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.020]
Oh it shows him there

[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:11.100]
It's got a big, uh,

[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:16.580]
Diagram in the back, a big photo of what it's going to look like the Marlins stadium

[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:19.640]
Marlins ballpark, all this other cramp

[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:22.160]
As City Commission took up the Marlins stadium issue today

[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:26.200]
Called the project an important part of the blueprint

[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:30.240]
For keeping Miami world class competitive city world class my ass

[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:31.600]
You're dreaming

[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:35.820]
Dreaming world class

[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:41.080]
About that again, that's you know people deluding themselves

[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:42.020]
Oh there's Chris Brown

[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:45.240]
His picture was on to you thing there Chris Brown

[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.040]
I wonder if he knows what's your name downtown

[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:49.260]
Julie Brown

[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:51.560]
Julie Brown, that's right very good

[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:55.600]
Anyway, uh, made the Marlins drop that's his normal can't

[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:58.300]
The shame on you Norma Foney baseball fan

[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.540]
Norma's just upset because they wouldn't hire him

[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.660]
Who wants to be the catcher?

[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:04.760]
Lots of experience for when I hear

[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.220]
Okay, now here's one that's wrong

[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:11.840]
On the RuPaul thing because RuPaul's actually got a name

[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.640]
I forget what it was Alex Charles or something

[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:13.980]
Right

[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:18.620]
But again, from a show based standpoint that's what we're talking about

[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:19.500]
And he's got a new show

[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:20.900]
RuPaul?

[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.880]
Yes, like a drag queen reality show

[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.080]
Yeah, it does

[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.880]
Maybe it's another chance to know

[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:27.480]
That's the worst though

[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:31.280]
The worst swill in history man, just nauseating

[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:33.840]
Here's one that says for me the most nauseating

[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:36.400]
One one's word celebrity name, one's word

[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:37.940]
Not one

[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:40.540]
Beyonce is Beyonce even a word

[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:43.460]
I think Beyonce knows his her name but nevertheless what do I know

[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:45.880]
I mean they do be further aware of that one name

[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:48.280]
But that isn't just her name her name is Beyonce Knowles

[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:48.700]
Am I correct?

[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:49.360]
Yes, correct

[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:49.940]
Yes

[01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:54.000]
So wrong and get some training

[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.640]
And once one's word celebrity

[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:01.640]
Oh, she's so many dumb people in so little time

[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:06.340]
Here's another one from somebody who says a Charro

[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:07.440]
Well guess what?

[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:09.780]
Charro, she's probably dead number one and number two

[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:11.260]
Who now remember sir remember Charro?

[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.300]
Yes, she's like the squares

[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:13.300]
She is?

[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:13.620]
Yeah

[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:15.620]
You want to put her on there Charro?

[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:16.440]
Gucci Gucci?

[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:16.860]
Sure

[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:18.020]
Charro

[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:23.820]
Now she was the upper left hand square or the upper right hand, I forget

[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:25.120]
I don't remember

[01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:26.960]
Paul Lin was in the middle

[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:27.660]
Hey Paul

[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:28.480]
You fairies

[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:29.020]
He's still dead

[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:31.360]
And buddy Hackett, he's also dead

[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.840]
That's a good poll question for George someday not for me

[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:37.180]
Favorite Hollywood square?

[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:39.300]
Dead or alive?

[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.060]
Charlie Weaver?

[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.000]
John Davidson?

[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:46.260]
Or could he be held out of tune or what?

[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:46.440]
No

[01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:50.000]
He was pretty though once upon a time he was a pretty guy

[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.940]
Had a pretty face, couldn't sing a lick

[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:53.180]
He licked it though

[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:57.720]
Steele also did Kiss and Rose from Batman and Robin which sucked

[01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:59.440]
Who would cast George Clooney as Batman

[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:01.160]
Complete Boltzman signed the Joker

[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:02.300]
Well the Joker knows

[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:06.800]
George Clooney just another one from our list of people I will not watch

[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.540]
I did watch that Seriana

[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.560]
Oh, what a piece of turd that was

[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:12.500]
Did you watch it?

[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:13.060]
Yes

[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:13.880]
Awful

[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:15.240]
Did you like it?

[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:15.580]
No

[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:17.080]
Seriana

[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:18.700]
We'll get back to you as Seriana

[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.560]
Oh, just nauseating

[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:24.560]
Kenny, oh from Lowbrow

[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.220]
Based on the way this is written I would say Lowbrow is correct

[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.980]
I recently saw the real Kenny Rogers on TV

[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:33.520]
It looks like he switched heads with a Chit Monk

[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:34.800]
C-H-I-T

[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:36.580]
Chit Monk

[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:39.000]
He looks very bizarre with the tight eyes and woolly face

[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.100]
The Chit Monks really pissed off he got stuck with a Kenny Hade

[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:43.440]
H-A-A-I-D

[01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:44.820]
Kenny Hade

[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:47.220]
Oh, okay, well they're just you know

[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:50.060]
Oh, and it says from Brandon don't forget to let's leave

[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:51.740]
Have to leave play Hank sleeping

[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:52.760]
Oh, yeah

[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:53.560]
You got it?

[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:54.360]
I have it

[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:55.860]
Well, when are we going to hear it?

[01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:56.460]
Whatever you want

[01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:59.520]
Well, let me just put it to you this way, okay?

[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:00.340]
Go ahead!

[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:01.980]
All right, here we go

[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:04.260]
We have baseball tonight

[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:06.420]
Mark

[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:07.840]
Hang on, sorry

[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:09.120]
We have baseball tonight

[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:13.000]
Marlins home this weekend before it

[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.600]
And how it's being reported

[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.800]
And you know what the deal is?

[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:19.440]
It didn't play right

[01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:21.720]
I'm not sure what's going on here

[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.500]
What are you doing?

[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:23.780]
I don't know, it didn't play right

[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:24.920]
Oh, God

[01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:30.600]
I'm not sure how to get it to play right

[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:33.860]
Well, you had something going there

[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:36.040]
Yeah, like previewed it, but it doesn't play the whole thing

[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:36.960]
Here we go

[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:38.540]
I think I got it now, Hank

[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:38.780]
Sure

[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:41.460]
Go ahead

[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:42.540]
Hang on

[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:48.200]
Okay, now I really have it

[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:50.700]
We have baseball tonight

[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:55.200]
Marlins home this weekend before they hit the road

[01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:59.180]
And then they'll go on a little west coast swing

[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:02.140]
560560 data, Brad

[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:07.020]
And Verizon and AT&T customers pound 560

[01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:09.460]
as we get you ready for the weekend

[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.720]
Talking about Tim Donaphy

[01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:16.240]
And now he's asleep

[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.000]
No

[01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:23.500]
The Humper's sleeping

[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:24.260]
Still

[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:28.960]
The Don was sleeping

[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.040]
But the Humper was sleeping

[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:32.800]
I'm thinking about this

[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:36.040]
So that whole five thing

[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.180]
I don't understand what happened

[01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:40.200]
He fell asleep and they just woke up and he kept talking

[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.840]
He fell asleep and then John Copa was producing the show

[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:45.980]
was using the talk back going, Hank, Hank, you're on, Hank, you're on

[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:48.740]
And then he popped up, says the time, and then exits out

[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.060]
Hey, stupid

[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:54.500]
Wow

[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:55.080]
Yeah

[01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:58.720]
Now, how many, how many hundred years ago was this?

[01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:01.360]
This was not too long ago

[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:02.400]
Really?

[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:03.640]
What do you mean not too long ago?

[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.180]
He's been off the station for over a year for like 14 months

[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:08.920]
Yeah, it was like right before, I guess they cut him loose

[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:12.380]
Oh, some other but jolly jo squeezed his pee bag

[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:14.440]
And used that as an excuse to blow him out

[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:14.980]
Maybe

[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:17.380]
Because he fell asleep on a year for a few seconds

[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:18.440]
Yeah, what's the big deal?

[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:21.960]
Here's one from Hawk Mark, Haineele and Lee again

[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.460]
I produced a whole show I booked a guest

[01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:25.000]
I provide non-sports office

[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.060]
which makes it stand apart from other sports shows

[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:29.620]
Show sounds and promotion slides sales for the show

[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:31.120]
Hey Lee, I'm kicking your ass

[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:33.340]
Promotions and promotions you can admit that at least

[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:36.000]
I have an appearance set up for the show every two weeks

[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.040]
And we get one to two thousand people that prestigious stain your highlight

[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:43.720]
Not to mention the other events and appearances that we use this show to promote

[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:47.460]
The only thing QM has over seven ideas, Niels Meal deals

[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:50.140]
They sells faster than Stugots equivalent promotion

[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:53.840]
We've had only, we've had month old coupons still available on the website

[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:55.260]
So obviously this is fake

[01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:58.360]
You shouldn't hire Kevin Rogers, he's a good guy

[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.040]
But he's better than anything you put up against us

[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:04.340]
We like thinking we like things just as they are in the afternoons

[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:07.580]
In other words, they love the big, they think he's

[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:09.500]
Rock solid is what they're trying to tell us

[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.360]
Oh me, oh me

[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.300]
Howard David's a bitch

[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:20.420]
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god

[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:24.160]
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god

[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:27.100]
You can't get over with that dewy set for that yet

[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:29.240]
He's got a lot of knowledge that's all about me now

[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:32.780]
I don't give a crap what that fairy has to say

[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:35.280]
If he wants to smoke pizza guys then what?

[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.460]
I know what I'm talking about

[01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:42.300]
I'm remodeling at the condo, I can't be elevated down

[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:45.200]
And on my way to the car when I pull my folding basket out

[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:46.940]
I give a three condo pizza

[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:49.840]
The toys are back and down

[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:51.360]
The toys are back and down

[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:55.740]
The toys are back and down

[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:58.480]
The toys are back and down

[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:01.920]
The toys are back and down

[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:05.360]
The toys are back and down

[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:14.740]
The toys are back and down

[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.900]
And I said the toys are back and down

[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:23.200]
And I got along the sport old booth

[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:26.020]
I know everything that's going on in that news.

[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:29.300]
Why I even know all the no-major rules.

[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:30.640]
I picked to the drive.

[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:31.880]
Daddy, hold on.

[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:34.900]
Too bad they're going faster than I.

[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.840]
It's a better show when I take your place.

[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.460]
I know I ain't no way to play with any.

[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:43.000]
But when they drop my voice, we'll change.

[01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:44.740]
A little smoothie in the bird.

[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.200]
A little baby in the bird.

[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:48.340]
A little baby in the bird.

[01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:52.000]
A little baby in the bird.

[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:54.220]
A little baby in the bird.

[01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:56.420]
A little baby in the bird.

[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:58.880]
A little baby in the bird.

[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.240]
1218 is 560 WQ.

[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:05.260]
I think there was a very poor taste that the sleep played that Hank fallen asleep on a year.

[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:05.760]
Sorry.

[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:09.440]
No, it wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be.

[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:10.860]
Because he wasn't snoring or something.

[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.820]
Who falls asleep mid-sentence?

[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.140]
I can understand if it's like a commas.

[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:15.920]
I think there was a break with high blood sugar.

[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.960]
That's like on the verge of death.

[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:24.500]
Somebody who's so enormous that they got more chins than a Chinese phone book.

[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:25.940]
Somebody like that, like the hopper.

[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.560]
Well, that'll teach him to go on a Dan LaBaster show.

[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:30.180]
Did he do that?

[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:32.900]
I think I would have gotten more than one spy report if that was true.

[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:34.060]
Yeah, I haven't heard that.

[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.280]
Although he was at other show.

[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:43.040]
And then Mo, of course, when 940 Fox Sports was going.

[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:46.980]
Well, he went on over there while I was on the air.

[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.140]
He did that just despite me.

[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:49.400]
Of course, it really worked like a charm.

[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:51.340]
How's that 940 Fox Sports doing?

[01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:52.320]
Maybe they're making a comeback.

[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:53.460]
What do you hear about that?

[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:54.440]
I hear it's coming back.

[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.280]
It's coming back in March, I believe.

[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:57.040]
That is true.

[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:01.020]
If it failed the first time, if it first, you don't succeed, fail fail again.

[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.340]
That's a lot of in this business.

[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:08.840]
Paul Rodriguez says no doubt it was Paul Lind, meaning the best Hollywood square.

[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:11.980]
He was also Samantha's gay uncle and be wished no kidding, Paul.

[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:14.400]
Like Paul's got to give me instructions about Paul Lind.

[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:15.420]
Come on, Paulie.

[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:16.900]
Let's get serious.

[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.720]
God, like I don't know my Paul Lind stuff.

[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:22.760]
And by the way, a little Paul Lind trivia.

[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:28.440]
Allegedly, he was a mean drunk like your buddy Harry Kerry also they said about him.

[01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:29.280]
Mean drunk.

[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.320]
Well, nasty.

[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:36.440]
And didn't Harry take a bad fall in a bar out west before he croaked?

[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:38.720]
I think that's what the lid of the croaking.

[01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:39.180]
Yep.

[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:40.700]
Died.

[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:41.940]
Took a bad fall.

[01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:42.400]
Drunken.

[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:44.280]
In a drunken stupor.

[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:45.120]
Bad drinker.

[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:48.560]
Anyway, so there's a Denys at least there used to be.

[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:49.280]
I don't know if it's still there.

[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:51.560]
Biscayne Boulevard on 36th Street.

[01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:54.260]
You know the Denys I'm talking about it.

[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:55.000]
Probably still there.

[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:55.580]
Yeah, it's still there.

[01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:56.740]
It's been there for 100 years.

[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:00.120]
Many, many years ago, many, many, I mean, long time ago.

[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:02.860]
Probably early 80s, I don't know.

[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:06.860]
Paul Lind was eating at that Denys and was just sourced.

[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:13.340]
I mean, he and his entourage just come out from a bar somewhere and made a big disturbance

[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:15.340]
and seen that they kicked his ass out of Denys.

[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:17.740]
Is that something great to put on your resume?

[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:18.960]
Wow, they kicked out a white person.

[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:23.480]
Now what kind of a racial comment is that?

[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:24.460]
Didn't they get in trouble for that?

[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:26.580]
No, they did not.

[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:27.440]
That wasn't Denys?

[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:29.620]
No, they kicked out a person.

[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:30.000]
Oh.

[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:33.260]
What are you talking about?

[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:38.280]
I thought they got in trouble for harassing African Americans or blacks, what have you been

[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:38.820]
to call them?

[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:40.300]
Whatever's politic.

[01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:41.080]
Dark folks, yeah.

[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:41.420]

[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:44.200]
I thought that was Denys that happened back in a day.

[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:45.960]
I mean, it may have been, I have for, I forget.

[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:47.920]
I think you're right.

[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:50.280]
Uh-oh.

[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:52.020]
People all over the place.

[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:53.900]
There's that plain crash and buckle ratio.

[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:57.220]
And all those people are still dead, by the way.

[01:39:58.400 --> 01:39:59.060]
Pretty sad.

[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:00.640]
Yeah, but that'll teach all you kids out there.

[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:01.600]
Don't ever fly to Buffalo.

[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:02.960]
Don't ever take a train there.

[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:04.060]
Don't drive there.

[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:04.820]
Don't take a bus.

[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:06.600]
Don't hitchhike to Buffalo.

[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:07.680]
Do not go there.

[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:11.840]
And nobody else saw the new, uh, the 2007 version of the hitcher.

[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:13.780]
I had no other, not one email about that.

[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:16.380]
I thought it was okay.

[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:19.520]
And I'm a real hard ass when it comes to remakes of movies.

[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.560]
Like Psycho and, oh my god, why do they do that?

[01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:26.080]
Because the original is always a million times better.

[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:29.900]
The only thing missing though, was that scene in the restaurant,

[01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:31.620]
where they had the fries sitting on the counter,

[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:32.980]
and there was a finger in it,

[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:36.000]
Rucker Hauer inventing finger food.

[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:37.020]
He was a great bad guy.

[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:38.720]
He was a great bad guy.

[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:43.040]
This guy in the new one, he was, he was, you know, a real scurvy looking guy,

[01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:47.480]
unshaven and smart me, but not an, and I'm the same category with Rucker Hauer.

[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:51.680]
And this one, of course, since it was years later,

[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:54.680]
had a lot more gratuitous violence, you know, blood and guts.

[01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:58.600]
Like that. Like the kid being a, being 10 and a half.

[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:04.400]
That was kind of a gory scene, but very quick,

[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:07.720]
if you have a weak stomach, don't watch it.

[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:11.220]
The hitcher, the remake.

[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:15.380]
Anyway, here's one that says, I was speaking of having a weak stomach.

[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:16.940]
Wait till you hear this. I don't believe it.

[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:17.180]
Okay.

[01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:20.000]
Went to the Hard Rock last night to play the slots.

[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:23.120]
I was walking around to find the machine I had won on last time.

[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:26.360]
I was there and saw the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life.

[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:29.880]
This middle-aged lady was playing on a machine, and as I passed her,

[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:33.400]
she swiveled her chair, puked on the floor, then swiveled back and kept her

[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.380]
around playing. Sick. I don't believe that.

[01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:36.100]
Do you believe it?

[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:37.020]
No.

[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.640]
She puked on the floor, then swiveled back and kept playing.

[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:43.980]
Anyway, I found my machine, the game show machine, 1,500 bucks.

[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:47.200]
Also, when you say you want 1,000, you subtract the money you put into

[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.940]
in the 1,000, Jim and Cooper City, who obviously need some,

[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:51.260]
help, of course.

[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:55.400]
Winning is over and above what you put in.

[01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:57.540]
Okay, I mean, do you take a genius to figure that out?

[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:01.060]
If you spent 1,000 and you got 1,000 out, that means you broke even.

[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:02.840]
That doesn't mean you won 1,000. Jim.

[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:03.320]
Right.

[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:04.020]
What?

[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:04.800]
No, that's right.

[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:06.500]
I mean, why does he have to ask me that?

[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:09.980]
I mean, Jesus, there are so many ignorant people.

[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:14.060]
I think he was probably affected deeply by that bitch swiveling around

[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:15.020]
and puking on the floor.

[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:18.020]
I mean, I know there's a lot of crude people out there,

[01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:19.000]
but I just, I don't know.

[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.520]
I can't believe that.

[01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:24.380]
Rudy says, with flea, you can have a conversation about sports.

[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:27.360]
In other hands, you can talk to George about roller skating.

[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:28.080]
In other hands.

[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:30.760]
What does that mean in other hands?

[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:31.640]
I don't know.

[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:33.500]
I never heard that expression before in my life.

[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.060]
In other, you can talk to George about roller skating.

[01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:40.780]
That's a shot at poor little George, who's off today.

[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:42.140]
He's enjoying the day off, I hope.

[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:45.120]
But he'll be on all next week with flea.

[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:46.580]
I'll be long gone, maybe.

[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:47.700]
I'll be long gone.

[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:50.660]
Brandon, don't forget to let flea play hang sleeping.

[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:51.680]
Yeah, we did it.

[01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:53.260]
Thanks for reminding us, though.

[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:54.220]
I would have forgot all about it.

[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:55.140]
That's what you were hoping for.

[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.200]
Now, how well do you know the Humber?

[01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.620]
Did you have much interaction with the Humber?

[01:42:58.820 --> 01:42:59.220]
Yeah, a little bit.

[01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:00.140]
And?

[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:00.820]
I like tank.

[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:02.620]
Of course, how can you not like tank?

[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.400]
Except when he goes out of the people's shows.

[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:07.240]
I don't believe he went on the levator.

[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:08.320]
I don't believe that.

[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:11.920]
Deal?

[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:13.960]
I find it hard to believe.

[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:18.320]
Well, if we get Neil, you bastard, you made my day

[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:20.600]
now that playing that Mohan Gildey song, that was great.

[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:20.980]
Well, good.

[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:21.380]
I'm glad.

[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:23.160]
I made this guy's day.

[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:25.480]
And then make you feel good?

[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:26.700]
Oh, yeah.

[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:29.380]
Neil, did you see the Jonas Brothers on Letterman last night?

[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:29.920]
No.

[01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:32.380]
Three ugly youngsters, what's the big deal?

[01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:34.160]
Anybody that says Joey Jonas is ugly?

[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:35.740]
Obviously, he needs an eye transplant.

[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.360]
Anyway, if you didn't, their co-hosting center,

[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:42.280]
I don't really care with this SNL with Alex Baldwin.

[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:45.160]
Hold on loosely, Kevin and Miami.

[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.760]
Hey, Jeff Lorry, a building-owned stadium,

[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:50.940]
you friggin' billionaire, and leave my money alone.

[01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:52.520]
You piece of...

[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:53.480]
Pust-pust-dual.

[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:54.940]
How do you like that?

[01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:55.600]
Pust-dual.

[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:01.040]
Phil Latsman, our post-personal friend, you know Phil?

[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:02.440]
I know up in.

[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:03.340]
Oh.

[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:04.620]
Phil Latsman.

[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.900]
Well, he's one of the few on your people's cousin,

[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:09.520]
his own little drop-in on this show.

[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:12.260]
Anyway, he says, is the flea nickname after the bassist

[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:13.460]
or for Red Hot Chili Peppers?

[01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:15.700]
No, it's spelled different.

[01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:16.680]
Oh.

[01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:21.500]
Then he's got a poll idea here, Phil does.

[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:23.520]
Your least favorite soft-loaded tourist, French Canadians,

[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:25.060]
New Yorkers, British Germans, et cetera.

[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:26.160]
Okay, thanks, Phil.

[01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:29.000]
Take that under consideration.

[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:30.660]
I vote for the French Canadians.

[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:33.680]
Ron says it is true.

[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:35.080]
It is true.

[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:36.240]
Hank called off the air.

[01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:36.980]
He wouldn't go on the air.

[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:37.660]
Oh, I see.

[01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:38.740]
Well, like you believe that?

[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:41.600]
Like anybody would believe it.

[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:42.940]
With all the crap they make up on there,

[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:45.260]
they got more fakers in two minutes than we got in 10 years

[01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:46.740]
on that labanstered show.

[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:48.280]
Hank Goldberg just called it.

[01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:51.740]
Well, the president Obama just called it off the air

[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:53.500]
said, great job, guys.

[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:57.500]
Oh, and another thing, there was cracker-birlha had the

[01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:58.340]
a factory problem.

[01:44:58.980 --> 01:45:01.700]
I don't know if the factory was a factory problem or a black problem.

[01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:03.740]
Well, you said factory, the black problem was definitely

[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:04.140]
Denny's.

[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:05.220]
They got sued and lost.

[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:08.340]
But maybe the cracker-birlha was the factory problem.

[01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:13.280]
What is this stupid thing?

[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:17.740]
Stadium concept, location Joe Robby's stadium is sight.

[01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:23.000]
New 40,000 stadium constructed up against the west side of

[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:23.620]
Dolphin Stadium.

[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:25.260]
And this goes on Marty and Davey.

[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:26.020]
Well, thanks, Marty.

[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:26.580]
You pay for.

[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:27.140]
You build it.

[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.860]
Dig deep into your pockets and you build it.

[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.880]
Neil, I received a card this morning advising.

[01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:36.540]
I'll receive an orange and blue envelope from Neilson in a few days.

[01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:39.640]
I'm in North Florida, so I'm not sure if it counts as streaming or not.

[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:42.420]
Also, well, Neilson doesn't do radio.

[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:43.120]
Radio.

[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:46.940]
Right?

[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:48.440]
The PPM is still arbitron.

[01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:48.980]
Right.

[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:50.600]
It's TV, man.

[01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:53.120]
Also, this morning we get Lexin Terry up here.

[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:55.980]
They were making fun of Paul and Young Ron's pictures on their web page.

[01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:57.340]
They're dressed up like bikers.

[01:45:57.340 --> 01:45:58.640]
Pretty sad regards Greg.

[01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.220]
Thanks, Greg.

[01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:00.640]
Lexin Terry's sucking.

[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:02.520]
And Paul and Ron, oh.

[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:05.900]
126 votes on the pool.

[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:06.740]
Puffies, kicking ass.

[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:07.660]
He's got 51 votes.

[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:10.040]
And WTF is in second place with 17.

[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.380]
Neilson, it's Friday.

[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:13.220]
You bastard.

[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:18.140]
Boys with unpopular names come met more crimes.

[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:23.240]
And David Caruso is taking advantage in CSI Miami.

[01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:25.200]
What do we got?

[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:27.480]
Well, Horatio looks like a homicide.

[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:29.300]
No clue who might have done it.

[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:30.400]
I know this much.

[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:32.440]
It was no Tom Dick or Harry.

[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:34.480]
Well, maybe Dick.

[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:40.280]
When they mean the suspect, people probably be something like Gaylord.

[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.200]
CSI Miami.

[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:44.380]
Still no leads in the case.

[01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:47.040]
I'm afraid we'll never find out who it is, Horatio.

[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:49.140]
Wait, Horatio.

[01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:51.840]
That's not a very popular name.

[01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:52.380]
What?

[01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:54.300]
Well, I had done the do with it.

[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:55.260]
I swear.

[01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:57.420]
What's in the name?

[01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:00.520]
Climb down on the next CSI Miami.

[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:02.280]
Oh, I can't wait.

[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:05.380]
1233 at 560 WQAM.

[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:07.600]
Oh, Mark Hockman just sent me a picture of myself

[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:09.480]
in his pink shirt city order work yesterday.

[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:10.420]
God is he ugly.

[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:10.980]

[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:14.660]
I deleted it immediately with a whole long song of dance.

[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:16.980]
Well, they just, they're obsessed over there, like I said.

[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:20.820]
Oh, we're going to get Neil to talk about us all day every day, yeah, sure.

[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:22.420]
Hockman is China.

[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.080]
Too many goi I'm working over there.

[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:27.060]
That's the biggest problem.

[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:31.280]
And then when you look at the Yiddloch, they got like Fat Josh Friedman.

[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:32.100]
Does he even count?

[01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:33.800]
Oh, my God.

[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:36.820]
Do you count him?

[01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:37.420]
No.

[01:47:38.180 --> 01:47:39.380]
Among the human species?

[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:41.200]
You know him?

[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:42.820]
I don't know on my know-of-him.

[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:44.140]
Have you ever seen it?

[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:45.040]
I have seen it.

[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:46.080]
Oh, wow.

[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:47.580]
Have you ever smelled it?

[01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:48.480]
Yeah.

[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:49.540]
Whoa.

[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:53.060]
Joe says Paul Lind was by far the best Hollywood square.

[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:55.340]
I'm not even an old, funny, dirty and I'm in Georgia's age.

[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:59.260]
But I found TV to be much more entertaining back in the 60s and 70s.

[01:47:59.340 --> 01:47:59.480]
Amen.

[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:04.300]
With his mother's brothers laughing the Gong show, Carol Burnett, all in the family, etc.

[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.020]
As far as Georgia's concerned, he's tough it up his act on the show, which is okay.

[01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:10.860]
But the fake laugh has to go.

[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:11.920]
Oh, he says Joe.

[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:14.520]
Oh, what fake laugh is he talking about?

[01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:15.540]
I don't know.

[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:19.240]
I guess you'll have to ask Georgia on Monday when he comes back.

[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:21.460]
Maybe he can do a sample fake laugh for you.

[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:23.320]
What do you think?

[01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:24.500]
I think so.

[01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:28.100]
When you guys have a great time next week, I'm sure going to be a misanet.

[01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:29.460]
Not.

[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:30.080]
No.

[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:36.260]
The fake Josh Cortes says, screw flea, he's taking the spot on the show belongs to me.

[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:40.720]
How dare he stick his weasel fingers into my business and messing with the streaming?

[01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:43.480]
How dare the fans like him more than they like me?

[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:48.800]
I hate you, flea, and then in Capitol letters, where the hell is my check old man, Josh Cortes?

[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:50.460]
I'll tell you where your check is, okay?

[01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:51.560]
In your Tullus.

[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:54.380]
Bend over, stick your head up your ass and look around.

[01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:55.960]
You'll find it.

[01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:58.740]
Joe Dodgeola is in there saying, is saying get a check.

[01:48:58.980 --> 01:48:59.420]
Get a check.

[01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:00.140]
Joe Dodgeola.

[01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:02.960]
Did you remember Joe Garajiola?

[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:03.520]
Oh, yeah.

[01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:04.340]
Do you?

[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:05.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:05.740]
He'll literate.

[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:07.180]
Here's a catcher, right?

[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:09.240]
Catcher for the pirates and the cardinals.

[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:10.600]
Long time broadcast, sir.

[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:12.540]
Well, you call it that.

[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:15.000]
Eliterate.

[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:16.760]
Get a check.

[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:18.020]
He got him.

[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:18.940]
He got him.

[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:19.960]
Oh, my God.

[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:22.180]
You wonder why there's so many Eliterate idiots running around?

[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:25.780]
It's not something brand new.

[01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:26.500]
It's gotten worse.

[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:27.360]
But oh, look at here.

[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.560]
Somebody that saw the hitcher.

[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:29.840]
High kneeling flea.

[01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:33.360]
The hot chick from the hitcher we make is Sophia Bush from the show One Tree Hill.

[01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:36.920]
She can kick C. Thomas Hall's ass in a heartbeat.

[01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:38.360]
I wouldn't be surprised as Nigel.

[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:43.440]
Maybe she'd like to lick, I mean, kick C. Thomas Hall.

[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.100]
We don't see him anymore.

[01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:46.740]
He kind of vanished real fast, didn't he?

[01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:47.180]
Yeah.

[01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:50.680]
He lost that youthful shine.

[01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:56.640]
Great article you might be interested in says Judy, and it's got a link to, uh, no, I will not.

[01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:58.860]
No, I just deleted it.

[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:00.180]
You're going to send me links.

[01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.920]
I mean, you know, if it kills some time for you, great.

[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:10.200]
Think is a think a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:12.000]
What is this about?

[01:50:14.180 --> 01:50:18.020]
When you go to a particular website, usually go through several immediate computer servers.

[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:21.320]
Your response is only going to be as fast as the slowest interlink.

[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:25.760]
In your case, it's the connection you have to your internet provider.

[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:29.180]
Since it seems like you have response time problem more than one application.

[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:31.360]
No, it's, uh, it just need to be rebooted.

[01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:34.040]
That's all don't get all don't get all technically wiggy on me now.

[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:34.300]
Okay.

[01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:36.920]
Lanyard Kendall.

[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:40.680]
My, my internet thing here is as fast as grease lightning fast.

[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:43.160]
You know what I mean?

[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:43.760]
I do.

[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:44.980]
And I have no downtime.

[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:45.780]
I have no complaints.

[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:49.780]
It depends on whether you have fiber optic cable to your curb.

[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:51.940]
If you have cable and how far know?

[01:50:52.220 --> 01:50:53.480]
A reality, a reality, a reality, a reality.

[01:50:53.700 --> 01:50:55.040]
Rebooting will not change these issues.

[01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:56.220]
Well, I don't have any issues now.

[01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:57.180]
K. Lanyard.

[01:50:57.540 --> 01:51:00.880]
However, when you get the applications responding, rebooting is not the only fix.

[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.920]
It's as simple as, okay, what do you say, Lanyard?

[01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:06.920]
P.S. it's complexioned.

[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:08.360]
Complexion is no speaker.

[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:11.200]
What does that mean?

[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:12.620]
I don't know.

[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:16.260]
Complexion and I don't know what he's talking about.

[01:51:16.340 --> 01:51:16.800]
Neither does he.

[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:18.920]
He's obviously doing serious drugs.

[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:19.740]
Nice.

[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:22.100]
And Kendall wouldn't surprise me at all.

[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:26.860]
Scott says didn't know she had her nose many.

[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:28.060]
Ilyana Rosanna then up.

[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:28.960]
Raffi Palma Rosanna.

[01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:32.400]
Yeah, when they were doing those steroid hearings, those baseball hearings in Congress,

[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:38.060]
total waste of time and money, she was there testifying on behalf of Raffi and Jose

[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:43.000]
and this one and that one, all the Cuban players and all liars.

[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:44.760]
And they turned out they were all lying.

[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:49.420]
Except for Jose, for once in his life, he told the truth for once.

[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:53.840]
And everybody said, oh, yeah, that's Jose, nobody believes him, especially about pay worried.

[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:55.900]
Yeah, that was surprising.

[01:51:56.300 --> 01:52:00.060]
Oh, she was going on and on about, oh, Raffi, and he's such a credit to the community.

[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:03.840]
And we've never street named after Jose and blah, blah, blah, blah.

[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.740]
She's just a professional crazy bitch.

[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:11.760]
And the people who vote for her, those people need to be exiled to Alcatraz somewhere.

[01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:17.040]
It says that means she's now going to call Roy Dealer's Communistists.

[01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:20.740]
See, people say this is Scott and Penelope's part.

[01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:22.840]
People write this stuff and they think it's very amusing.

[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:25.460]
I guess they're chucking them themselves like George with that laugh.

[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:30.920]
Don't forget she and Lincoln Dipschmidt, Braveheart, tried to derail the World Baseball Classic

[01:52:31.980 --> 01:52:33.360]
because it was in Cuba.

[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:34.400]
Cuba was in it, whatever.

[01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:38.440]
Yes, I've thought it was such a paradise that the wife and I left it.

[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:39.560]
It's Scott and Penelope's part.

[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:40.720]
But do you know Penelope's part?

[01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:41.840]
Well, haven't been a Tampa go.

[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:42.400]
Oh, yeah.

[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:44.380]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:47.320]
Penelope's part is the armpit of that area.

[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:47.980]
Really?

[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:48.340]
Yeah.

[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:51.380]
Whoa, you hear that's got fleeces.

[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:54.000]
Penelope's part is the anus of the universe.

[01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:58.560]
I wonder if they have a famous anus there.

[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:00.860]
You like famous anus cookies?

[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:01.720]
Yep.

[01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:04.640]
And what about that anus burger with bacon and cheddar?

[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:07.580]
That someday you're going to get at Mickey D's, I'm telling you, it's damn good.

[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:08.240]
Someday?

[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:10.780]
Tuesday they got a big promotion going on McDonald's.

[01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:11.660]
What?

[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.980]
Tuesday by a quarter pounder with cheese and get a second one for a quarter.

[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:15.700]
Wow.

[01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:16.140]
Yeah.

[01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:17.980]
I don't like quarter pounder with cheese though.

[01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:18.700]
No, don't buy that.

[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:20.660]
I tell you why I do love is the double cheeseburgers.

[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:21.360]
There you go.

[01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:24.380]
Love Mickey D's double cheeseburgers.

[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:30.120]
I used to have like a, and I don't eat just the meat like I used to do an Amsterdam.

[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:31.480]
I don't throw away the bun.

[01:53:31.740 --> 01:53:32.320]
I eat the whole thing.

[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:36.100]
I mean with all the ice cream and candy and crap I eat, I mean, what do I mean?

[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:37.640]
At least enjoy something good.

[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:38.380]
Mm hmm.

[01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:46.960]
Here's one from not sure it said, and this stuff goes back because I always tell you that the pile is upside down.

[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:51.380]
In other words, the stuff from earlier on gets shuffled at the bottom of the pile as the new emails come in.

[01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:51.880]
Right.

[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:56.940]
So about the Forbes magazine article that says Miami was the ninth most, what was it?

[01:53:58.220 --> 01:53:58.800]
Worse cities.

[01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:00.100]
Not worst city.

[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:00.880]
What was the word?

[01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:03.180]
I don't remember.

[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:08.900]
The pressing negative, unlivable horrendous grotesque slime ball.

[01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:12.460]
He says, I take issue with the Forbes magazine piece as well.

[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:15.060]
My problem with the piece is not that Miami's on the list.

[01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:17.180]
My problem is that Miami's not number one on the list.

[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:24.340]
Miami is so far away the worst city in America and probably the world I've been to the slums of Mumbai and Miami makes that place look like Park Avenue.

[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:26.700]
That no other municipality should even be in the top 10.

[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:28.560]
Miami should have that list all to itself.

[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:31.620]
Eliana Rosanna Dan needs to shut up and drop dead not in that order.

[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:38.260]
As far as the stadium issue, no, no, a million times no.

[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:41.440]
Even the unthinkable happens and Jeffrey Laurie decides to pay for it himself.

[01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:42.980]
They should still turn them down.

[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:53.720]
Not only should there be no new stadiums, whether a taxpayer spends or not, but the existing one should be torn down, tear them down, build schools, hospitals, homeless shelters, halfway houses, rehab centers, prisons, etc.

[01:54:54.140 --> 01:55:00.340]
Unicides currently occupied and wasted by dual full stadium in Macarena, the AA Lockhart stadium, all of them.

[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:03.000]
Kick air be sports team, the F out of the area.

[01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:06.000]
Sports and sports fans have been the reundation of South Florida.

[01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:07.920]
Get rid of them all. Get rid of them all.

[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:10.520]
F South Florida have a great taste and certainly not sure.

[01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:13.000]
Sounds like he's sure to me.

[01:55:13.060 --> 01:55:13.820]
Oh, Neil!

[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:16.660]
It's Friday, you bastard.

[01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:19.880]
Today on Dr. Fit, let's do it.

[01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:21.180]
Batman goes ballistic.

[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:22.800]
Okay, what's your story?

[01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:26.220]
I want you off the f***ing set, you f***ing sorry.

[01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:27.860]
No, don't just be sorry.

[01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:30.000]
Think for one f***ing second.

[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:34.320]
You are volatile, unpredictable. You have rage problems.

[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:35.540]
No, shut the f*** up.

[01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:37.340]
The old bitch and since you got here.

[01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:39.340]
Hey, a f***ing distracting.

[01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:41.260]
I don't get that.

[01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:43.360]
What don't you f***ing understand?

[01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.520]
Do you just kind of like a good fight?

[01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:47.120]
What the f*** is it with you?

[01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:49.120]
Yeah, you just kind of like start up and get the good fight.

[01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:51.140]
Oh, good for you.

[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:53.100]
What's your point? What are you trying to tell me?

[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:54.460]
Kick your f***ing ass!

[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:55.660]
Do you want a piece of me?

[01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:58.540]
No, no, no!

[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:01.080]
It's a f***ing are you doing?

[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:02.000]
No!

[01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:03.140]
No!

[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:07.320]
Oh, by the way, Phil Arck, I don't care how many times you send me your stuff.

[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:10.300]
You're stupid, mischief about the, you disagree with me about the Marlins stadium

[01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:11.560]
and I'm doing a disservice.

[01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:14.140]
You can send it a hundred times and I'll delete it every time.

[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.820]
This is an idiot who no matter what I say, he disagrees.

[01:56:18.020 --> 01:56:20.640]
Mr. Contrary, Mr. you know, just to bust my balls.

[01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:23.240]
Is if you care about Phil Arck?

[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:23.780]
No.

[01:56:24.140 --> 01:56:24.640]
Neither do I.

[01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:26.200]
You think the world cares about Phil?

[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:26.560]
No.

[01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:27.300]

[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:31.060]
Anyway, Scott says, flea is right.

[01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:33.620]
And like I've said, Penelos Park makes Tamrac look like heaven.

[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:36.740]
What is it about Penelos Park that so grotesque?

[01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:37.900]
You want to see Rednext?

[01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:38.800]
You go to Penelos Park.

[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:42.980]
Oh, you can go anywhere over in the, the general day in the Tampa area.

[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:45.780]
Yeah, but people in Tampa call people from Penelos Park Rednext.

[01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:46.140]
Really?

[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:48.480]
Oh yeah, it's trailer city, man.

[01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:52.260]
Matt says, I've been listening for over 16 years now.

[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:53.660]
I know it's the second of any of your shows.

[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:54.740]
I love you, Neil.

[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:58.680]
The first time I heard about, about you, I lived in Tampa and listened on WSUN.

[01:56:58.780 --> 01:56:59.240]
How sad.

[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:03.020]
Back then, you and Rick Riley had a beef with each other about a briefcase.

[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:04.100]
I think you even had a song.

[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:05.600]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase.

[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:08.920]
Can you tell me the story behind this around the ear about this today?

[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:10.860]
PS Joey Jonas is no Luis Miguel.

[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:13.040]
And I have no life, says Matt.

[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:18.720]
Well, Joey Jonas is no Luis Miguel in that, uh, Luis can sing great.

[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:20.960]
And Joey is, uh, you know, half his age.

[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:21.800]
Other than that.

[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:26.800]
Rick Riley, I could play it.

[01:57:27.260 --> 01:57:31.180]
But then at the end, he says, Rick Riley, you ready to make sure I, uh, get out of it.

[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:32.460]
You're an A-hole.

[01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:37.860]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase.

[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:42.100]
I liked the part in his face.

[01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:42.740]
Uh-oh.

[01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:44.400]
There's one in there is a fart sound.

[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:47.100]
Farmy Dink, what gives him the right?

[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:47.860]
Oh!

[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:51.440]
I think his wife, what a bite it off tonight.

[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:54.820]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase.

[01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:58.820]
What does this grace to the human race?

[01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:01.840]
Rick, you're a smuck.

[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:03.640]
You ain't got birdsucks.

[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:07.940]
That wheel of meat should also include Rick Riley's butt.

[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:09.060]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:11.360]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase.

[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:15.020]
I liked the part in his face.

[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:15.600]
Hey, help.

[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:18.000]
Rick Riley, you're an A-hole.

[01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:18.660]
Oh, see?

[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:20.120]
But I got it.

[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:20.780]
Oh, good job.

[01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:26.080]
Hey, I'm quick on the trigger now that we've been joyously recuey him.

[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:27.520]
I'm really on top of it.

[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:32.380]
1249, 11 before, uh, one, whatever the hell it is.

[01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:35.200]
We got that Gulf Stream stuff coming up pretty soon.

[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:38.780]
And the four in the night, I haven't got one email about that.

[01:58:39.340 --> 01:58:40.520]
About the four-hours in the second race.

[01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:41.320]
My pick for art.

[01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:41.740]
Hmm.

[01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:43.160]
Calabria.

[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:45.600]
Why not?

[01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:48.260]
Oh, Phil sends it again.

[01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:48.620]
I can play.

[01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:49.640]
Well, keep sending it, Phil.

[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:51.280]
I just deleted it again.

[01:58:51.620 --> 01:58:52.240]
Keep sending it.

[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:55.800]
Here's one from one of our chronic regulars.

[01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:57.220]
Love this kid flee.

[01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:58.140]
Are you a kid?

[01:58:58.760 --> 01:58:59.000]
No.

[01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:03.080]
His energy, brains, opinions, and balls so rare these days.

[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:03.900]
Keep it up, kid.

[01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:05.220]
That's how you go places, kid.

[01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:06.060]
All right.

[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:08.900]
And then there's a poll suggestion from Stephen Jersey.

[01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:09.820]
Okay, kid.

[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:12.720]
How old are you?

[01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:13.660]
40.

[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:15.600]
40 years old and you're a kid.

[01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:16.560]
Well, compared to me, you are.

[01:59:16.900 --> 01:59:17.060]
Yeah.

[01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:20.580]
156 votes on this horse ball pool.

[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:23.340]
I don't like this pool that much.

[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:24.780]
I'd lay the, I don't like that many of them.

[01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:27.300]
But at least people are sending them in and there's something to stick on there, you know?

[01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:28.000]
Mm-hmm.

[01:59:28.300 --> 01:59:29.240]
Something to stick it.

[01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:31.200]
156 votes.

[01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:33.620]
Which of these one name people disturb you the most?

[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:34.560]
Puffy 60.

[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:35.500]
He is disturbing.

[01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:37.520]
WTF20.

[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:38.420]
Madonna 15.

[01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:39.460]
Prince 15.

[01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:40.400]
Eminem 12.

[01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:41.820]
Rupal 8.

[01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:43.380]
Bjork 5.

[01:59:43.820 --> 01:59:44.540]
Bono 5.

[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:45.980]
Seal 5.

[01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:47.060]
Cher 5.

[01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:47.720]
Pink 4.

[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:48.500]
Sting 2.

[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:49.720]
And Charro None.

[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:52.220]
And that's because who now remembers Charro?

[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:56.720]
Kuchi, kuchi, kuchi, kuchi.

[01:59:57.660 --> 02:00:00.460]
Peter Marshall, the host of the original Hollywood Square.

[02:00:00.620 --> 02:00:01.340]
Now that was a show.

[02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:03.200]
It was stupid, but it was fun.

[02:00:03.300 --> 02:00:04.280]
George Goble was on there.

[02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:04.680]
Uh-huh.

[02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:06.940]
And Charlie Weaver.

[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:10.000]
Cliff Arquette.

[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:14.940]
And who is the guy with the puppet?

[02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:17.200]
With the puppet.

[02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:18.560]
Yeah.

[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:19.800]
It'll come to me.

[02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:32.960]
I don't know.

[02:00:36.100 --> 02:00:36.440]
I don't know.

[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:37.400]
I don't know what the deal is.

[02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:38.120]
I can't look at her.

[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:39.460]
Whoopee.

[02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:40.940]
I say, whoopee.

[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:41.800]
Oh, no.

[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:42.960]
It's whoopee.

[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:43.740]
And I change the channel.

[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:46.820]
In fact, my remote is programmed to change the media.

[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:47.820]
Because she comes on the screen.

[02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:48.400]
Mm-hmm.

[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:49.780]
And I think that's what I'm going to do.

[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:49.780]

[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:49.780]

[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:49.780]

[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:49.780]

[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:49.780]

[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:49.780]

[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:49.780]

[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:49.780]

[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:49.780]

[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:49.780]

[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:49.780]

[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:49.780]

[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:51.840]
Here's one from Cliff and Kendall.

[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:53.900]
Shocking email.

[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:56.220]
Subject the devil's playground.

[02:00:56.780 --> 02:00:57.860]
Did you see this?

[02:00:58.060 --> 02:00:58.740]
I'm sure you didn't.

[02:00:58.820 --> 02:00:58.960]
Neither.

[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:00.180]
Neither did anybody else.

[02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:00.380]
No.

[02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:03.780]
Wednesday night.

[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:11.800]
I watched the most interesting show on National Geographic called the devil's playground.

[02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:14.580]
It was about Amish children.

[02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:19.940]
When the Amish children 16, they were allowed to go out into the world on what's called

[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:20.900]
Rommas Springer.

[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:22.820]
Rommas Springer.

[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:25.920]
I wonder if that's kid-elect jury Springer.

[02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:28.780]
Have you ever heard of this, Rommas Springer?

[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:29.160]
No.

[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:31.580]
Rommas Springer apparently means party time.

[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:33.340]
I couldn't believe it.

[02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:36.560]
These Amish kids parties so hard they would have put George to shame.

[02:01:37.220 --> 02:01:40.520]
They had raves thousands of Amish kids from all over the country would gather together

[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:41.480]
for huge parties.

[02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:46.160]
I'm talking booze guys like pot smoking, crystal meth and wild sex.

[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:47.120]
Wild.

[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:47.620]
Wild.

[02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:50.420]
Matches ordinary pedestrian sex but wild sex.

[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:50.860]
All right.

[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:53.300]
I just found it to be so amazing.

[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:58.680]
I was considered the Amish to be ultra conservative in the whole other world.

[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:01.500]
A few things struck me after watching the show.

[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:03.660]
Number one, there are no fat Amish people.

[02:02:04.460 --> 02:02:08.380]
Number two, the Amish are good looking people and three of these people practice what they preach.

[02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:09.900]
Rommas Springer.

[02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:15.360]
The most bizarre thing that struck me was that the Amish considered any education of the eighth grade to be dangerous.

[02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:19.980]
Too much education produces false pride so say it the Amish.

[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:21.960]
Interesting shows his cliff in Kindle.

[02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:24.560]
A national geographic called the devil's playground.

[02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:26.720]
PS best line of the week.

[02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:28.420]
It's a vagina, not a clown car.

[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:30.740]
That was for the abit with the 800 kids.

[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:32.060]
Cute.

[02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:32.720]
That was a good laugh.

[02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:34.160]
And George or chuckled.

[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:34.960]
He churdled at it.

[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:37.620]
He didn't like laugh wildly or like that.

[02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:40.060]
But he churled chuckled with it to fake laugh or real laugh.

[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:41.340]
It was the Georgia's fake laugh.

[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:41.740]
Okay.

[02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:43.020]
He does it a lot lately.

[02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:45.000]
Or he's mailing it in.

[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:45.140]
Oh Jimmy.

[02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:45.540]
What?

[02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:46.680]
He's mailing it in.

[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:52.460]
Jimmy Dorsky says that crazy octomom bitches back in the news.

[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:55.140]
Not that she or her traveling vagina circus ever left.

[02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:59.320]
It was Jimmy's line, I think, about the clown circus.

[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:05.420]
She was spotted at a game stop store purchasing video games, which I guess were unavailable at her babies or as registry.

[02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:10.160]
I'd suggest she try to find Nintendo's hot selling hard to find why we fit.

[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:14.060]
A wireless exercise board to be played on the Nintendo Wii.

[02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:16.300]
No, I'm not making a fat mom joke.

[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:20.440]
I'm just suggesting she buy a large item she can try wedging between her wide open beef curtains

[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:22.320]
in case there are any kids left up in there.

[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:30.160]
Glad to know she has extra money for digital entertainment, and that she won't be needing our tax dollars or donations to feed, clothes, and shelter her enormous tribe.

[02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:34.120]
And if anyone who doesn't have kids can't fully fathom how screwed this woman is,

[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:38.780]
imagine if the kids from eighties enough moved in with the Brady bunch and they lived in Ralph Cramman's apartment.

[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:40.860]
We should have a pool going on.

[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:45.900]
How long until we see this fetus factory on extreme home makeover have a great week off Jimmy Dorsky.

[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:46.520]
Thanks Jimmy.

[02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:47.200]
Jimmy D.

[02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:51.400]
I wonder if Jimmy D. knows will he be?

[02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:54.280]
Oh, wait, I'm flowers and mad him. Thank you so much. Isn't it amazing?

[02:03:54.940 --> 02:03:58.040]
I can ask any obscure question. Oh, look at that. Look what just popped up again.

[02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:00.540]
The picture of the fat obnoxious Josh Friedman.

[02:04:00.540 --> 02:04:04.300]
The fake emailer from across the street says the phantom informer.

[02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:08.960]
Phantom informer has usually got his thumb right in it. He usually knows his crap.

[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:13.660]
So what do you think about that?

[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:17.600]
I don't know. Josh Friedman being the, he's large.

[02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:22.560]
I think there's a whole bunch of them. They sit around. They got nothing else going on, especially in midday.

[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:24.420]
They got no audience. So I'll tell you that.

[02:04:24.820 --> 02:04:28.860]
Oh, but we're going to kick your ass and we got all these people emailing and they're great.

[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:34.340]
They got all these hits on there or whatever. You know, see, unfortunately, that doesn't make for ratings.

[02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:39.320]
They think that they can continue manufacturing bull crap talk about ratings, which they don't have.

[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:43.420]
They never have had another than the afternoon. They don't have now. They're never going to have.

[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:48.140]
I think what we need is a hundred like Ray Perry would say a hundred more sports stations in town.

[02:04:48.620 --> 02:04:50.620]
That would bring a lot more people to sports talk radio.

[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:54.800]
I tell you what it would do. Ray would bring a lot more people to take the radios and taking a ball,

[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:58.700]
paying hammer and smashing them into pieces. Do you think? Sure.

[02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:06.740]
How much more can you say about the freaking game? Okay. How much more can you say about give me the ball, give me the ball, give me the ball,

[02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:10.240]
and how much bigger can we build that freaking wall of football?

[02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:13.740]
Oh, the water to two hours.

[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:21.320]
Welcome to Hot Ball. I may say, I say I'm Chris Madgers. I gotta be honest with you.

[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:25.740]
I feel like a little fluffy white cat who's just been giving a warm ball of milk.

[02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:30.780]
I feel like a completely different patient since we have our new president Barack Obama.

[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:36.020]
It's just like I've had show ghost whisperer with Jennifer Love You and the play psychic medium of indigordin

[02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:38.940]
when she looks at Sam, she sees that that husband Jim's face,

[02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:44.120]
because when he died he jumped in the same body. I draw the parallel because when people look at me they see me,

[02:05:44.260 --> 02:05:46.320]
Chris Madgers from Hot Ball, that must have been sick.

[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:50.440]
But when I look in the mirror I see a little girl in a pink wrapper, my hair in pink tails,

[02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:53.140]
licking a lollipop with like a two-footed circumference.

[02:05:53.380 --> 02:05:56.840]
I feel like Rose from tonne of half man, you know, Charlie Stark or girlfriend.

[02:05:57.240 --> 02:05:59.420]
I'm totally in love with a man who doesn't know him alive.

[02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:03.840]
But it not is not, people say to me, hey Chris, what about the fact that the downpunch

[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:06.040]
to its lowest level on a night-eeration day history?

[02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:11.300]
So what? People say to me, hey Chris, how can we possibly create four million new jobs under the Obama administration?

[02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:15.760]
I say he can, he's a candy man. He can take a rainbow, wrap it in his side.

[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:18.080]
So get in the sun and make it gravy-light and pie.

[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:23.760]
I feel like a cherry pop type that's been big, golden brown, the perfection and the toast to rub and

[02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:26.300]
he's just sitting on the counter waiting to be consumed.

[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:30.300]
I feel like Angelina Jolie's underpins. It's a new day.

[02:06:30.540 --> 02:06:34.580]
Same old crappy economy, war is horrible, real estate market, endless despair and divisiveness.

[02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:37.020]
But now we have a president who can take tomorrow.

[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:42.340]
Dimpit in the dream, separate the sorrow and collect a ball of cream, a bomb of can, a bomb of can.

[02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:47.020]
He's a candy man. I push my fingers, play high-poll, I'm a semper state.

[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:49.460]
Bulk and take a sunrise.

[02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:50.960]
Fuck a tank of sunrise.

[02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:55.140]
And then sprinkle it with dough and buy the can.

[02:06:55.700 --> 02:06:58.860]
It covers even chocolate and America with two. You know why?

[02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:00.380]
He's a candy man.

[02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:03.840]
Yes he can. The candy man can.

[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:07.700]
Okay, 102, look at that there. Coming out of the track for the first race of Gulfstream.

[02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:08.200]
All right.

[02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:12.120]
Well, 13 minutes to post. It can't be coming out on the track.

[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:15.140]
They're going in there in the walking ring.

[02:07:15.580 --> 02:07:16.960]
Give her a check out the walking ring.

[02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:19.200]
I have. New and everybody. Welcome back to Gulfstream Park.

[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:20.420]
Rollie Hight, Ron Nicoletti.

[02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:24.580]
The odds couple with you for a Friday TGIF edition, Ron.

[02:07:24.900 --> 02:07:27.200]
And we're going to get a lot of trouble for putting this on here.

[02:07:27.420 --> 02:07:29.500]
I think it feels very summery down here.

[02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:32.980]
Send in that. That was the crap that we're trying to pedal yesterday from across the street.

[02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:36.640]
Well, we're going to get even with Sid the kid what you guys did to Sid someday show.

[02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:41.600]
Yeah, great comparison. No, you think? Oh, yeah, putting NFL broadcast on the radio.

[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:43.980]
To the middle of the country, but it was very windy.

[02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:45.540]
That's why they had to come to me.

[02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:48.020]
It was windy. Just pull my microphone over. Excuse me.

[02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:49.040]
Okay. No, yeah.

[02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:52.440]
Oh, Ron Nicoletti. This is the New Yorkie guy that does the handy cramping there.

[02:07:52.580 --> 02:07:55.620]
Yeah, nice guy. We picked somebody else in the first and the second race to them.

[02:07:55.880 --> 02:07:58.200]
He doesn't know anything. No, right.

[02:08:00.020 --> 02:08:02.060]
Trying to remember who we picked. I don't recall.

[02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:05.220]
I think he picked the kissing code to five. That'll be the chalk.

[02:08:06.460 --> 02:08:08.200]
Scratch the two in the first race of Gulfstream.

[02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:11.480]
I don't know about the second race. And is what Steve's slowing out there or what?

[02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:14.040]
He's there. Is he really as he plunged in his guts out?

[02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:17.580]
Is he lose a lot of what? He's okay. He does okay.

[02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:19.660]
That means he's a liar. Yeah.

[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:23.220]
That would be like I told you I do okay at the slots.

[02:08:23.420 --> 02:08:26.080]
You know, I mean, actually I do okay compared to like most I guess.

[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:30.960]
Have a lot of winning days, but over the long run here comes the bunny and there goes your money.

[02:08:33.740 --> 02:08:37.520]
Yeah, the hostage for the first race. They picked the one I'm not I'm not going to get involved with them.

[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:42.440]
Okay. And I'm not getting any information about that second race about the four horse.

[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:47.060]
Steven Jersey still in Jersey says 40 sorry for the kid reference.

[02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:50.960]
You sound much younger. Well, I wouldn't say much younger much squeakier.

[02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:58.220]
Yeah. Is the term as in the chic like that.

[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:02.240]
Prime. You know, you need to better net. Wow.

[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:07.660]
See, when people give me that crap about guilty, having been in this business since I was 17 years old,

[02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:09.320]
which means almost 50 years, it.

[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.960]
It just doesn't take a genius to figure out that if somebody is going to be a broadcaster,

[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:17.460]
that what's necessary isn't like a great voice like, you know,

[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:21.380]
Walter Cronkider, Westbrook Van Vories, but at least a decent voice.

[02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:28.160]
A reasonable voice, not like the chic and certainly not like Yieldmeister.

[02:09:29.380 --> 02:09:31.540]
You ever watch the pink Panther cartoon?

[02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:40.560]
No, I was gonna say because I can't tell the difference between the art bark from the art bark and the anteater show or whatever it is and Sid.

[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:46.560]
And Sid. Hey, yeah. Yeah. I can't stand Sid.

[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:51.040]
Really? You said the kid? Yeah. Everybody's good buddy across the street.

[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:53.200]
That wants to be on everybody's my space page. Whatever.

[02:09:53.420 --> 02:09:58.000]
He sent me a friend request. I deleted it immediately.

[02:09:58.540 --> 02:10:01.080]
He also sent me a one word message. You know what the word was?

[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:01.420]
What?

[02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:02.860]
Yeah. That was it.

[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:06.980]
And I thought to myself, boy, is this really a putzer what?

[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:09.240]
That was my first like interaction with this creature.

[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:14.200]
Of course, if you had talked to big gaming, you had a one share in the morning.

[02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:16.440]
Probably you'd be. It would get to you.

[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:17.760]
Well, you know what he says about that, right?

[02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:18.740]
What's that?

[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:23.240]
He says the one share are the smart people in South Florida and everybody else in the kitchen.

[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:23.920]
Listen to it.

[02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:26.440]
Well, that will make you a lot of money.

[02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:28.240]
The smart people.

[02:10:29.140 --> 02:10:30.700]
The New York inbreds is what they are.

[02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:33.840]
Anyway, it says my comments remain keep up the good work.

[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:37.920]
You sound much younger. Steve says in Jersey, Paul in the greatest center square ever.

[02:10:38.180 --> 02:10:40.800]
My long dead mother referred to him as wishy washy.

[02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:46.680]
Maybe swishy washy was indeed a mean drunk according to several books in 60's entertainment.

[02:10:46.860 --> 02:10:48.940]
Yeah, that's what got kicked out of Denny's.

[02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:52.220]
For making a big scene and being drunk is a skunk.

[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:57.980]
My guilty pleasure is the Mickey D's double cheese hold the cheese.

[02:10:58.420 --> 02:11:01.240]
Steve, I hate to break the news to you, but they have a word for that.

[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:03.920]
It's called double hamburger, not double cheeseburger.

[02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:06.980]
You don't order cheeseburger and say hold the cheese.

[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:10.680]
I've had order to take you to charge me more for no cheese, Steve.

[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:13.520]
Maybe because they figure you're an idiot and you'd pay more.

[02:11:14.620 --> 02:11:15.620]
Hold the cheese.

[02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:18.080]
I mean, what does that mean?

[02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:19.540]
Can you figure that out?

[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:19.800]
No.

[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:22.480]
Is he too stupid to say give me a double hamburger?

[02:11:23.140 --> 02:11:24.320]
Because they do have such a thing.

[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:25.440]
I guarantee you that.

[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:28.060]
No, no, you're wrong, Neil.

[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:29.160]
They don't make a double hamburger.

[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:30.180]
It's a double cheeseburger.

[02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:31.300]
You have to tell them, hold the cheese.

[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:32.960]
Hold the cheese, my ass.

[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:34.480]
Hold the cheese.

[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:37.160]
As Josh Redman would say, squeeze the cheese.

[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:37.960]
Oh.

[02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:41.220]
Well, here come to your horses out of the track.

[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:42.500]
It goes to me for the first race.

[02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:45.120]
Walker's beach with Carlos Marquez, Jr.

[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:51.020]
That wouldn't surprise me if his daddy was a great writer somewhere named Carlos Marquez,

[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:52.420]
Sr. To his out.

[02:11:53.100 --> 02:11:54.580]
Three is, say, Valleier.

[02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:56.360]
Elvis Trujillo.

[02:11:57.480 --> 02:11:59.680]
How come we don't hear the PA guy doing the opposed parade?

[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:00.500]
Hmm.

[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:02.160]
Oh, boy.

[02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:03.900]
That's bad.

[02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:04.740]
Four.

[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:06.580]
Stephen loves me.

[02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:07.700]
Rowan Vargas.

[02:12:08.540 --> 02:12:12.580]
I've heard of a Rowan horse, but that's an unusual name for a jockey in it.

[02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:13.120]
Rowan.

[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:14.120]
Yeah.

[02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:18.260]
The horse is a chestnut and the jockey is a Rowan.

[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:21.080]
Julio Castillo rides the five initial contact.

[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:22.840]
Fourteen to one.

[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:23.680]
No chance.

[02:12:24.020 --> 02:12:25.000]
Nice red silks, though.

[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:28.220]
I love those people go to the track and the woman will say, oh, what?

[02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:29.420]
Pretty colors on the six.

[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:29.640]
Yeah.

[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:31.660]
Six is a bumblebee colors.

[02:12:31.660 --> 02:12:33.060]
Do you jockey make good money?

[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:34.840]
This is some of them.

[02:12:34.860 --> 02:12:35.200]
You bet.

[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:35.620]
Yeah.

[02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:36.440]
They get 10 percent.

[02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:37.760]
You know, emotional, Jermaine Pridman.

[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:41.600]
They win a lot of races and they ride in big races.

[02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:43.000]
You bet they make serious money.

[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:44.120]
Some of them make millions.

[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:45.620]
Wesley Henry Jr.

[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:47.160]
The seven grand aza.

[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:52.320]
The eight is MacRomey with Arice Campos.

[02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:53.740]
ARES.

[02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:54.920]
You ever hear of a name like that?

[02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:55.440]
Arice?

[02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:55.780]
No.

[02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:56.180]
No.

[02:12:56.700 --> 02:12:57.700]
Pedro Monterey Jr.

[02:12:57.920 --> 02:12:58.120]
Nine.

[02:12:58.560 --> 02:12:59.380]
Cruisin Countis.

[02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:02.560]
Why is it that so many of the jockeys are Hispanic?

[02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:06.940]
I was eight or T's rides the 10, my mom's image.

[02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:08.220]
I've always wondered that.

[02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:15.200]
A lot of them come from Latin American countries where horse racing is big, I guess, but why aren't they more like Anglo jockeys?

[02:13:18.220 --> 02:13:19.220]
Have you ever wondered that?

[02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:20.920]
Not really.

[02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:22.020]
Well, why not?

[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:23.840]
You're getting into this crap.

[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:25.080]
You go out there when George is there.

[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:25.700]
Yeah, it's fun.

[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:29.280]
You actually put a few bucks down or not?

[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:30.300]
Every once in a while.

[02:13:30.580 --> 02:13:31.080]
Yeah, not.

[02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:31.980]
That means not.

[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:32.620]
Cheap skin.

[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:34.300]
Well, it's not a kind of no the worst.

[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:36.100]
With a kind of pick, you're having to take.

[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:37.340]
I wouldn't be gambling away any money.

[02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:38.020]
I'll tell you that.

[02:13:38.020 --> 02:13:39.380]
Yeah, but the good news is I had X to work.

[02:13:40.700 --> 02:13:41.360]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:42.340]
X to work for less money.

[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:43.820]
Sounds like you're complaining already to me.

[02:13:44.060 --> 02:13:44.220]
What?

[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:46.960]
Sounds like flea is belly-acon.

[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:51.960]
You ought to be ecstatic that you have a chance not to put clearance in its place.

[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:55.680]
Well, I just hope that my, I hope that my pay-acon is going to be a little bit more than that.

[02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:57.640]
I think I'll allow the stockholders to get their dividend this year.

[02:13:59.700 --> 02:14:01.660]
That's my message to the stockholders, okay?

[02:14:04.260 --> 02:14:06.940]
Listing to the little dog the other morning, he was upset that one of them,

[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:09.800]
you have a right recruits wasn't going to sign with the canes.

[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:13.940]
So he and the insults to the kids parents for letting him do that were flying from the callers

[02:14:13.940 --> 02:14:15.100]
and from Joem himself.

[02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:18.600]
At one point, Jo stopped himself short before he hurled another insult.

[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:21.920]
He actually looked at a list of 200 words that you can't see on QAM.

[02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:23.540]
Is that true that there's a list?

[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:24.140]
Yes.

[02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:26.700]
If so, put it on your page so we can see them.

[02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:27.760]
How effing ridiculous.

[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:29.880]
Love the show Rob and Seth Miami, chronic.

[02:14:30.660 --> 02:14:31.080]
Thanks Rob.

[02:14:33.180 --> 02:14:36.340]
So they were knocking the kids parents because they wanted to go to UM.

[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:38.300]
Maybe they wanted to get like a real education or something.

[02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:39.420]
It wasn't so much his parents.

[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:44.260]
This kid Bryce Brown has a mentor who's also like his priest or whatever.

[02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:45.360]
Yeah, you're all.

[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:46.400]
Taken him under his wing.

[02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:47.040]
Oh!

[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:52.400]
Well, that's not a good idea.

[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:52.900]
No.

[02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:56.520]
Oh, and here's this thing again about the Joaquin things.

[02:14:56.580 --> 02:14:57.480]
I'm going to delete that.

[02:14:57.580 --> 02:14:58.860]
I don't care about Joaquin things.

[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:00.760]
And I don't stay up to watch Letterman.

[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:01.180]
Sorry.

[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:02.780]
A link.

[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:05.660]
Yeah, my wife says it's fake that he's acting.

[02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:07.540]
I think he's high.

[02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:09.140]
Yeah.

[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:12.120]
And I don't really care whether he's high or acting or acting high.

[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:17.600]
Because I mean, I know who he is, but he's like number one ugly and number two can't act as wet of a paper sack.

[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:19.100]
I thought he was pretty good and walked the line.

[02:15:19.940 --> 02:15:20.920]
I didn't see it.

[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:22.380]
You think I would walk the line?

[02:15:22.660 --> 02:15:23.520]
You don't like Johnny Cash?

[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:25.020]
Oh, my God.

[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:27.960]
You've got to be kidding me.

[02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:28.920]
Country music and me.

[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:30.780]
We just, oh, here's PayPal.

[02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:33.320]
There's PayPal member, another fake thing.

[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:35.080]
Okay, I'm printing out all the real stuff.

[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:41.380]
And of course, when we say real stuff on these emails, what we think might be real, as opposed to what we know, is Erzatz.

[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:45.700]
Okay, let's see what I just printed out.

[02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:51.700]
Kathy says, were you referring to the change over at WINZ just now when the SMA Times can you talk about sports?

[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:52.960]
Well, that was one of the things.

[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:58.600]
All of this crap we can't sell progressive radio and so on is just that crap.

[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:05.320]
This is because having a propagated monopoly on their waves is more important to these people, meaning cheap channel, than money they make on the year.

[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:09.780]
Sucking up to Republicans helps them and other aspects of the business so they're trying to kill off these other stations.

[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:14.340]
I got news for her when it comes to killing off stations, cheap channel are the experts.

[02:16:14.980 --> 02:16:23.960]
And speaking of suckups, heard Bubba loves bunch this morning, had a lawyer on to take calls from listeners, but for some reason they used the time to have the guy prove he could get Charlie Christ on the phone.

[02:16:24.820 --> 02:16:32.280]
Christ actually took this call and Bubba and the multitude in the studio proceeded to kiss every inch of Charlie's ass and congratulate him on his marriage.

[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:33.480]
Hey, Charlie, you fairy.

[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:37.180]
Wow, Pete all over his shoes for being willing to appear with Obama and Ford Myers.

[02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:43.860]
Next time, leave the TV cameras at home and see if Christ shows up since Kathy. Kathy's a little pissed off at your gay governor.

[02:16:43.860 --> 02:16:49.460]
But Bubba is all up his rectum, Charlie Christ. Really? Oh, yeah, wouldn't be the first one.

[02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:52.640]
And I bet you the attorney is Steven Diaco a guy went to high school and college.

[02:16:52.940 --> 02:16:57.180]
But if it's by vomit times, it must be getting pretty crowded back there. Say it again.

[02:16:57.660 --> 02:17:06.020]
And I would say the attorney is probably Steven Diaco, who is brothers of the person that did the gasp of bypass surgery on Bubba. He's a good friend of mine. I went to Florida State with him.

[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:06.840]
Really? Yeah.

[02:17:07.820 --> 02:17:10.200]
Does he know Hulk Hogan? Oh, yeah.

[02:17:13.980 --> 02:17:19.240]
Oh, I've never heard that show and I'm sure I never will. So how can I comment on it? I won't.

[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:23.400]
What a pucks. Of course you can ask for a double hamburger, even if cheaper. Says Larry.

[02:17:25.540 --> 02:17:27.620]
So why don't you ask for a guy? I don't get it.

[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:35.300]
Oh, I see he's just knocking at the guy. Yeah. Double cheeseburger. Hold the cheese. Oh my god.

[02:17:35.300 --> 02:17:40.540]
I'm surprised he doesn't whip out his junk and say hold my cheese. Walker's beaches third at the rail.

[02:17:40.740 --> 02:17:46.360]
Then comes emotional in fourth. Mac Graham about to be taken on by save Valleier.

[02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:48.160]
Save Valleier Drift.

[02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:52.400]
First crazy. We don't have any best interest in this. And Mac Graham is back in the second.

[02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:56.920]
I'm pleased to win. I have no idea what the prices and save Valleier come under the wire.

[02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:00.800]
Three seven something Mac Graham seconds and third is going to be close.

[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:05.420]
But it was close. The one that beat the three was a five to one.

[02:18:06.300 --> 02:18:12.760]
Cash ain't tickets. No, dammit. It's that twa Friday. You bastards.

[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:15.300]
I'm pleased to win.

[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:31.060]
Talkers. What are we gonna do? I say talkers. We are all being screwed. I say listen.

[02:18:32.060 --> 02:18:37.660]
Twice this happening to us. We want the MCC to get our fun.

[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:45.580]
There's no place for us now even DJs are all down in the mouth. You can listen.

[02:18:46.440 --> 02:18:52.500]
But now you will find any words that will call up your mind.

[02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:59.440]
No fun to be. No fun to be.

[02:18:59.620 --> 02:19:06.080]
That's what I do. You're fair. There's nothing left for us to enjoy.

[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:10.360]
We'll soon be playing with children. No fun to be.

[02:19:10.660 --> 02:19:11.820]
That's what I do.

[02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:14.040]
No fun to be.

[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:20.640]
They want us to be clean. They think they know what we should feel.

[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:23.480]
They try to dictate to us what is real.

[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:29.600]
Young and old. Knees listen to us. I say young and old.

[02:19:29.980 --> 02:19:32.780]
Police don't put up a bus. Help us put your shirt.

[02:19:33.700 --> 02:19:39.960]
The MCC but you're not a bus with one female rider.

[02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:44.080]
Can't do it. All my selfless self-help him.

[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:49.560]
Don't put it up on the shelf. Let the MCC know just how you feel.

[02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:53.940]
And maybe we'll get the fun just while we feel.

[02:19:55.900 --> 02:19:59.660]
MCC what are you doing to us?

[02:20:00.100 --> 02:20:03.880]
MCC what are you doing to us?

[02:20:04.380 --> 02:20:07.940]
Our rating for slide. In fact, in my time.

[02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:14.020]
Because of the MCC you want to band what we can do.

[02:20:14.340 --> 02:20:17.760]
MCC you band what we can do.

[02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:22.300]
You've even tried to band the record.

[02:20:23.020 --> 02:20:25.160]
That's the DJ's name.

[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:29.400]
People are in touch with you.

[02:20:29.700 --> 02:20:30.680]
I said people.

[02:20:31.380 --> 02:20:33.100]
They stand and fight for what's true.

[02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:34.340]
And you're a leader.

[02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:40.460]
And too so far so we can tell the MCC what the end of all day.

[02:20:40.740 --> 02:20:41.480]
Our Neil Roger.

[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.020]
And so far on your side.

[02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:45.180]
People.

[02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:47.640]
We have nothing too hard.

[02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:49.040]
Young and old.

[02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:51.240]
Get your opinions out.

[02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:55.360]
And maybe the MCC will stay out.

[02:21:00.360 --> 02:21:02.640]
MCC in the morning now.

[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.240]
MCC in the evening now.

[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:08.700]
No one knows what works right now.

[02:21:08.700 --> 02:21:15.040]
We are on the MCC to let us see.

[02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:16.720]
Go away.

[02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:19.400]
MCC.

[02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:25.920]
MCC let us live our lives for real.

[02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:29.260]
Wow, she's in pain.

[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:29.960]
Let me tell you.

[02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:34.020]
We're with the ending.

[02:21:35.460 --> 02:21:36.960]
I got some breaking news.

[02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:37.740]
What?

[02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:39.020]
I got some breaking news in this

[02:21:39.020 --> 02:21:39.480]
work world.

[02:21:39.620 --> 02:21:39.820]
Yeah.

[02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:42.240]
The heat trade Sean Miran and

[02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:43.920]
Marcus Bank to the raptors.

[02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:46.200]
For Germano, Neil and

[02:21:46.200 --> 02:21:47.020]
Jamari O'moon.

[02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:47.760]
Who cares?

[02:21:48.140 --> 02:21:48.620]
Somebody.

[02:21:51.060 --> 02:21:52.180]
Oh my God.

[02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:53.400]
My four horse in the second

[02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:54.660]
race of Gullstein opens at four

[02:21:54.660 --> 02:21:55.240]
to five.

[02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:56.640]
Four to five favorite.

[02:21:56.780 --> 02:21:57.020]
Chalk.

[02:21:57.520 --> 02:21:57.860]
Chalk.

[02:21:58.540 --> 02:22:00.400]
The one that you won entry is two

[02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:00.740]
to one.

[02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:01.560]
Second choice.

[02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:03.420]
But the four is five to one in

[02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:04.440]
the morning line opens at four

[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:04.840]
to five.

[02:22:04.940 --> 02:22:06.140]
Shame on you.

[02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:08.440]
Get that baby a backup at

[02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:09.160]
least to two to one.

[02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:10.940]
Four to five.

[02:22:10.940 --> 02:22:11.960]
Who now wants four to five,

[02:22:11.980 --> 02:22:12.220]
right?

[02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:13.180]
Oh, that's a good sign.

[02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:14.060]
No early money.

[02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:16.780]
So what would that pay on a

[02:22:16.780 --> 02:22:17.420]
$50 win?

[02:22:18.460 --> 02:22:19.040]
Well, let's see.

[02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:19.980]
Four to five pays three

[02:22:19.980 --> 02:22:20.320]
eighty.

[02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:24.200]
So fifty is forty ninety

[02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:26.060]
ninety five bucks.

[02:22:26.140 --> 02:22:26.480]
I'll take it.

[02:22:28.380 --> 02:22:29.120]
That's not very good.

[02:22:29.900 --> 02:22:31.540]
I mean, you know, eight to five

[02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:32.440]
it's going to go back up.

[02:22:33.480 --> 02:22:34.760]
But I got an early dump.

[02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:35.820]
Do you ever see a horse taking

[02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:37.120]
early dump just today?

[02:22:38.180 --> 02:22:39.120]
See, there you go with George

[02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:39.480]
again.

[02:22:39.580 --> 02:22:40.320]
This is just this morning

[02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:41.300]
is supposed to say just this

[02:22:41.300 --> 02:22:41.600]
morning.

[02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:41.880]
Sorry.

[02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:43.160]
Do it just like George.

[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:44.000]
Just this morning.

[02:22:44.420 --> 02:22:45.340]
Just like George.

[02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:46.300]
Go ahead.

[02:22:49.240 --> 02:22:50.220]
Okay, hundred ninety eight

[02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:51.240]
votes on this second poll

[02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:51.620]
of the day.

[02:22:51.620 --> 02:22:53.180]
This this poll really blows.

[02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:54.960]
It's like, well, we don't have

[02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:55.140]
one.

[02:22:55.140 --> 02:22:55.840]
So here's something.

[02:22:56.880 --> 02:22:58.060]
Which of these one name

[02:22:58.060 --> 02:22:59.180]
people distribute the most

[02:22:59.180 --> 02:22:59.180]

[02:22:59.420 --> 02:23:01.380]
Puffy 73 WTF 23

[02:23:01.380 --> 02:23:03.520]
Madonna 22 prints 21 and then

[02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:04.700]
after that, small potatoes.

[02:23:05.300 --> 02:23:06.160]
I thought you were going to

[02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:06.880]
give me some breaking news

[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:08.400]
about the vote on the stadium.

[02:23:08.640 --> 02:23:09.160]
No, I haven't heard

[02:23:09.160 --> 02:23:09.580]
any of you.

[02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:10.520]
A bunch of heat crap.

[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:10.920]
Yeah.

[02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:12.620]
Well, the heat in the

[02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:13.060]
Raptors.

[02:23:13.100 --> 02:23:14.180]
They both suck by the way.

[02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:18.360]
What if they're playing that

[02:23:18.360 --> 02:23:19.820]
game from Tampa again on

[02:23:19.820 --> 02:23:20.360]
leafstv.

[02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:23.940]
What a tough down.

[02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:26.360]
I see a little king.

[02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:27.360]
Who now cares about the

[02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:27.500]
LA?

[02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:28.820]
Even in LA they don't

[02:23:28.820 --> 02:23:29.160]
care about the

[02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:30.120]
Stinking Kings.

[02:23:30.180 --> 02:23:31.060]
No, that's in

[02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:31.760]
scratchy.

[02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:32.940]
Screw him.

[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:33.500]
Needle knows.

[02:23:34.420 --> 02:23:34.900]
Well,

[02:23:34.900 --> 02:23:36.180]
deserved that Phoenix is a

[02:23:36.180 --> 02:23:37.540]
franchise on the verge.

[02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:40.720]
Miami City commissioners

[02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:41.600]
stood poised to vote over

[02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:42.480]
this afternoon on a

[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:44.000]
historic pact that could

[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:44.560]
bring a new baseball

[02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:45.560]
stadium to little Havana.

[02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:46.100]
God forbid.

[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:48.360]
Miami mayor, many D.S.

[02:23:48.440 --> 02:23:49.140]
in his opening statement

[02:23:49.140 --> 02:23:50.240]
of city commissioners took

[02:23:50.240 --> 02:23:50.920]
up the Marlon City

[02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:51.900]
issue today called the

[02:23:51.900 --> 02:23:52.780]
Public Works project.

[02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:54.080]
An important part of the

[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:55.120]
blueprint for keeping Miami,

[02:23:55.520 --> 02:23:56.760]
a world-class competitive

[02:23:56.760 --> 02:23:58.380]
city in the decades to come.

[02:23:58.380 --> 02:24:02.000]
World-class city says many

[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:02.440]
D.S.

[02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:03.240]
Who evidently doesn't get

[02:24:03.240 --> 02:24:03.720]
around much.

[02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:10.700]
The S. Place the state in the

[02:24:10.700 --> 02:24:11.700]
same category as public

[02:24:11.700 --> 02:24:13.100]
investments in park space

[02:24:13.100 --> 02:24:13.960]
and performing arts

[02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:14.380]
centers.

[02:24:15.700 --> 02:24:16.760]
Most of the stadiums

[02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:17.720]
cost to be footed by the

[02:24:17.720 --> 02:24:18.740]
public, but D.S.

[02:24:18.860 --> 02:24:19.640]
seized upon the fact that

[02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:20.360]
the contribution is

[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:21.400]
primarily in the form of

[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:22.920]
hotel bed taxes, which

[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:23.860]
are often paid by

[02:24:23.860 --> 02:24:24.260]
tourists.

[02:24:25.040 --> 02:24:25.920]
What tourists?

[02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:27.920]
We got tourists if you're

[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:28.360]
counting on public

[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:28.360]

[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:28.360]

[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:28.360]

[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:28.360]

[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:28.360]

[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:28.360]

[02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:30.040]
investments.

[02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:30.640]
The stadium D.S.

[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:31.660]
said is a $600 million

[02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:32.980]
local investment using

[02:24:32.980 --> 02:24:34.080]
other people's money.

[02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:37.840]
Oh, and the investment

[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:38.580]
couldn't come in a more

[02:24:38.580 --> 02:24:39.620]
needed time, D.S. said,

[02:24:39.900 --> 02:24:40.800]
with the economy struggling

[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:41.820]
deeply, the mayor says,

[02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:42.640]
government's got a

[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:43.520]
responsibility to create

[02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:44.320]
jobs and stadium

[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:45.540]
construction, but creates

[02:24:45.540 --> 02:24:47.140]
some 2,000 jobs, with

[02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:47.720]
hundreds of new

[02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:48.660]
permanent jobs, once the

[02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:49.500]
facilities complete.

[02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:51.160]
The S. City recently

[02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:51.980]
visited the construction

[02:24:51.980 --> 02:24:53.020]
site of an office building

[02:24:53.020 --> 02:24:53.600]
being built on

[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:54.840]
brick-a-lava, and the workers

[02:24:54.840 --> 02:24:55.860]
there urged him to secure

[02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:56.580]
passage for the new

[02:24:56.580 --> 02:24:56.900]
stadium.

[02:24:57.740 --> 02:24:57.920]
D.S.

[02:24:58.000 --> 02:24:58.340]
quoted one of the

[02:24:58.340 --> 02:24:59.200]
workers telling him,

[02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:00.200]
I have no idea what I'm

[02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:01.000]
going to do once I'm done

[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:01.260]
here.

[02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:03.400]
The mayor also said he was

[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:04.580]
offended by the talk that the

[02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:05.240]
kinds of jobs the

[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:06.520]
stadium producers are low

[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:08.180]
wage, less desirable jobs.

[02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:10.200]
These jobs, D.S. said, made

[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:11.840]
it possible for him to become

[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:12.860]
the first and his family to

[02:25:12.860 --> 02:25:13.480]
attend college.

[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:14.680]
Well, evidently he didn't

[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:15.160]
learn much.

[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:19.340]
Here's one of the responses

[02:25:19.340 --> 02:25:20.400]
because in the herald on the

[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:21.160]
website they've got a whole

[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:22.740]
of these are a lot of very

[02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:22.980]
funny.

[02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:25.460]
This one isn't funny, it's

[02:25:25.460 --> 02:25:26.100]
for just accurate.

[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:27.360]
We're just using other

[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:28.400]
people's money, although

[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:29.460]
so tell taxes could go

[02:25:29.460 --> 02:25:30.480]
a long way toward refurbishing

[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:31.120]
some of the tourist

[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:32.380]
infrastructure here, like

[02:25:32.380 --> 02:25:33.400]
the convention center which

[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:35.200]
actually has a real return on

[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:35.640]
investment.

[02:25:36.020 --> 02:25:37.020]
No one comes to Miami for

[02:25:37.020 --> 02:25:37.340]
baseball.

[02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:38.160]
That's his ludicrous.

[02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:39.340]
And who says a world class

[02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:40.720]
city has to have baseball

[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:41.140]
theme?

[02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:42.780]
London, Paris, Hong Kong,

[02:25:43.020 --> 02:25:43.980]
Beijing, Rome, don't have

[02:25:43.980 --> 02:25:44.620]
baseball teams.

[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:46.340]
Nor does Mexico City, a

[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:47.260]
Rio, Sao Paulo.

[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:49.140]
Baseball is basically a

[02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:49.400]
U.S.

[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:50.500]
Japanese Cuban Caribbean

[02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:50.800]
game.

[02:25:50.900 --> 02:25:51.640]
It's not a world sport.

[02:25:51.980 --> 02:25:52.420]
Well said.

[02:25:54.900 --> 02:25:56.280]
The horses are coming on the

[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:57.220]
track for race three at

[02:25:57.600 --> 02:25:57.940]
aqueduct.

[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:00.920]
After rail today, I don't

[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:01.660]
think he's got more

[02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:02.040]
cheerleys.

[02:26:02.220 --> 02:26:03.200]
Speed, but I guess give one

[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:04.800]
to two on the rail, one to

[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:05.860]
two in a six to five horse

[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:06.220]
field.

[02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:08.200]
Don't you hate those tiny

[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:09.380]
fields like that five horses?

[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:10.500]
What kind of a pay off you're

[02:26:10.500 --> 02:26:11.100]
going to get in that?

[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:13.140]
Well, let's take a look and

[02:26:13.140 --> 02:26:14.200]
see how my four horses being

[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:14.760]
back to go.

[02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:15.940]
He's still favorite eight to

[02:26:15.940 --> 02:26:16.240]
five.

[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:18.120]
Well, that's a good sign.

[02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:20.160]
He's five to one in the

[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:20.560]
morning line.

[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:21.320]
He's getting better eight to

[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:21.560]
five.

[02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:22.240]
That's a good sign.

[02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:23.020]
He's got a he's alive.

[02:26:23.220 --> 02:26:24.000]
Maybe he's alive.

[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:25.840]
Guess who died?

[02:26:26.060 --> 02:26:26.940]
Who's no longer alive?

[02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:27.460]
I don't know.

[02:26:27.780 --> 02:26:28.740]
Outside the after the break.

[02:26:28.860 --> 02:26:29.520]
Oh, you!

[02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:29.960]
Yep.

[02:26:30.100 --> 02:26:32.320]
It's Friday, you bastards.

[02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:40.980]
The worst of these

[02:26:40.980 --> 02:26:42.440]
did all the bad you find.

[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:44.300]
The worst of these

[02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:45.580]
don't like the worst of

[02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:46.080]
our sins.

[02:26:46.540 --> 02:26:47.800]
The worst of these

[02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:49.000]
folks, they have to

[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:49.620]
get out of here.

[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:50.560]
I'm dead.

[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:54.120]
The right way nuts

[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:55.760]
want to

[02:26:55.760 --> 02:26:56.600]
throw

[02:26:56.600 --> 02:26:58.700]
sectors from ourselves.

[02:26:59.100 --> 02:27:00.800]
You don't watch

[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:03.700]
what you say you

[02:27:03.700 --> 02:27:04.560]
better or else.

[02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:06.460]
You're best at

[02:27:06.460 --> 02:27:08.680]
you're best at

[02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:10.180]
the worst of these

[02:27:10.180 --> 02:27:11.440]
are monetary

[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:13.340]
to every

[02:27:13.340 --> 02:27:14.100]
boy.

[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:15.120]
I'm a fucking

[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:16.440]
ill-stead

[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:18.860]
and I think

[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:20.800]
me.

[02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:22.620]
I can

[02:27:22.620 --> 02:27:24.320]
say this

[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:26.760]
on three-three.

[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:30.920]
I hear my

[02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:31.700]
order unit

[02:27:31.700 --> 02:27:33.080]
is this to do the

[02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:33.900]
getting forced

[02:27:33.900 --> 02:27:34.820]
land-widding

[02:27:34.820 --> 02:27:35.600]
by the power

[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:36.380]
that's been made

[02:27:36.380 --> 02:27:37.440]
on Lord God's

[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:39.040]
push, the federal

[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:39.580]
investigation

[02:27:39.580 --> 02:27:40.480]
is commissioned

[02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:41.460]
and my prompt

[02:27:41.460 --> 02:27:41.920]
seems to

[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:42.780]
have come from the house.

[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:43.840]
I think this is

[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:44.740]
a monomax

[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:46.240]
of the

[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:46.240]

[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:47.200]
The worst of these

[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:48.440]
are the worst of

[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:49.400]
these.

[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:51.340]
They want my

[02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:52.160]
civil rights.

[02:27:52.980 --> 02:27:54.160]
The worst of these

[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:57.560]
are the worst of these.

[02:27:58.640 --> 02:27:59.400]
You fail.

[02:27:59.900 --> 02:28:00.900]
The worst of these.

[02:28:01.020 --> 02:28:01.800]
Okay, one thirty-two

[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:02.640]
and five sixty-and-one

[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:02.960]
twenty-two and one

[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:03.460]
twenty-twenties

[02:28:03.460 --> 02:28:04.320]
away from that second

[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:04.500]
race.

[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:05.320]
The pressure building

[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:05.540]
there.

[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:06.020]
Oh, yeah.

[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:07.180]
A Gulf Stream.

[02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:07.820]
Oh, that's right.

[02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:08.340]
You're not a Gulf

[02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:08.560]
Stream.

[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:08.760]
No.

[02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:10.560]
Here's that third

[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:11.260]
race at the

[02:28:11.260 --> 02:28:11.700]
Anquaduct.

[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:12.460]
That one is a heavy

[02:28:12.460 --> 02:28:12.780]
truck.

[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:15.220]
Three to four, seventy-five

[02:28:15.220 --> 02:28:15.860]
cents on a buck.

[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:16.500]
Leads.

[02:28:17.340 --> 02:28:18.880]
After a soft half mile

[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:20.100]
of fifty-one second.

[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:20.960]
Fifty-one.

[02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:21.600]
You're calling.

[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:22.560]
It's a five-horse field.

[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:23.200]
They're walking

[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:24.180]
their own hands and knees.

[02:28:25.180 --> 02:28:25.820]
And one historic

[02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:27.880]
four heavy truck is still

[02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:28.980]
forth and making a move

[02:28:28.980 --> 02:28:29.660]
on the fourth turn.

[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:30.540]
Three lengths from the

[02:28:30.540 --> 02:28:30.780]
lead.

[02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:31.620]
Then banjo.

[02:28:31.620 --> 02:28:32.220]
Now he's turned.

[02:28:32.660 --> 02:28:33.660]
Midway on the turn.

[02:28:34.220 --> 02:28:35.200]
In between horses, the

[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:35.920]
man can step.

[02:28:36.380 --> 02:28:37.400]
On the outside, Mr.

[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:39.200]
again, and need a name at

[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:39.640]
the rail.

[02:28:39.940 --> 02:28:41.040]
Three of them across the

[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:42.780]
track with heavy truck

[02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:43.880]
on a far outside.

[02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:45.560]
What do you think?

[02:28:45.860 --> 02:28:46.880]
Three quarters and one

[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:48.520]
sixteen and two.

[02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:49.080]
One sixteen.

[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:50.060]
I could go this.

[02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:50.860]
Mr. again.

[02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:52.000]
The one's not going to get

[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:52.220]
there.

[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:53.200]
I'll do that right now.

[02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:53.860]
No change.

[02:28:54.940 --> 02:28:55.840]
No change.

[02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:56.200]

[02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:56.620]
The one outside is bad

[02:28:56.620 --> 02:28:57.060]
action.

[02:28:57.440 --> 02:28:58.520]
Towards the rail is need a

[02:28:58.520 --> 02:28:58.900]
name.

[02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:00.300]
Then the man can step.

[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:02.740]
Mr. again leads by two

[02:29:02.740 --> 02:29:03.440]
and a half lengths.

[02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:04.740]
That action.

[02:29:04.940 --> 02:29:05.460]
In second.

[02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:06.500]
That action is right.

[02:29:06.500 --> 02:29:07.400]
Heavy truck.

[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:08.960]
Here comes the bunny and

[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:09.540]
there goes your money.

[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:10.600]
A desperate second.

[02:29:11.300 --> 02:29:12.200]
That's what happens when

[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:12.980]
you get away fifth and a

[02:29:12.980 --> 02:29:13.600]
five horse field.

[02:29:13.940 --> 02:29:15.340]
And you go those unbelievably

[02:29:15.980 --> 02:29:16.620]
slow fractions.

[02:29:17.140 --> 02:29:18.080]
But that was aqueduct and

[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:18.780]
we don't care about that,

[02:29:18.780 --> 02:29:18.940]
right?

[02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:19.220]
No.

[02:29:19.620 --> 02:29:20.520]
Oh, and by the way, we

[02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:21.480]
won't hear about the stadium

[02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:22.620]
deal until late tonight because

[02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:23.500]
they haven't even gone in front

[02:29:23.500 --> 02:29:24.400]
of the county commissioners.

[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:25.720]
They're still in front of the

[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:26.880]
city commissioners right now.

[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:28.600]
There's many commissioners.

[02:29:28.700 --> 02:29:29.040]
Oh, yeah.

[02:29:29.220 --> 02:29:30.040]
You got that word right.

[02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:31.080]
Two to one on the forward

[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:31.860]
Gulf Stream, by the way.

[02:29:31.980 --> 02:29:32.740]
Seven to two on the entry of

[02:29:32.740 --> 02:29:33.020]
the one.

[02:29:33.620 --> 02:29:35.040]
And three to one on the five.

[02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:37.400]
Five must be that.

[02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:38.080]
Oh, yeah.

[02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:38.960]
Kissing code.

[02:29:41.980 --> 02:29:43.520]
I'll just we'll just leave it

[02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:43.700]
there.

[02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:45.700]
So we are going to hear about

[02:29:45.700 --> 02:29:45.820]
it.

[02:29:45.900 --> 02:29:46.660]
Well, I don't have to keep going

[02:29:46.660 --> 02:29:47.940]
back and looking at the hero.

[02:29:48.180 --> 02:29:48.400]
No.

[02:29:50.020 --> 02:29:50.840]
I'll be damned.

[02:29:51.460 --> 02:29:52.560]
Gay Ted and Welton Manners

[02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:53.320]
obviously are fake.

[02:29:54.840 --> 02:29:56.640]
Since as a fellow as a fellow

[02:29:56.640 --> 02:29:58.220]
gay fellow around the same

[02:29:58.220 --> 02:29:59.760]
age as you, I'm surprised to

[02:29:59.760 --> 02:30:01.060]
restrict the movies that you watch.

[02:30:02.380 --> 02:30:03.560]
See, I watch movies that I

[02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:04.440]
think I'm going to enjoy.

[02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:05.700]
I know that comes as a great

[02:30:05.700 --> 02:30:06.240]
shock to you.

[02:30:06.520 --> 02:30:07.420]
Not that somebody else told me

[02:30:07.420 --> 02:30:08.620]
that they enjoyed, but movies

[02:30:08.620 --> 02:30:09.620]
that I think I'll enjoy.

[02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:11.900]
You should be open every genre

[02:30:11.900 --> 02:30:13.200]
and actor out there, but I'm not.

[02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:15.060]
Why would you not watch a walk

[02:30:15.060 --> 02:30:16.240]
to line or movie with George

[02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:16.680]
Clooney?

[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:18.200]
Because I hate George Clooney.

[02:30:18.480 --> 02:30:19.680]
And I did watch Seriana from

[02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:21.240]
Start to Finish and it sucked.

[02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:22.440]
It blew.

[02:30:23.860 --> 02:30:25.360]
Why not watch the movie first before

[02:30:25.360 --> 02:30:26.880]
me in a format opinion on it?

[02:30:27.460 --> 02:30:28.560]
Let me tell you why, because it

[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:29.620]
takes an hour and a half or two

[02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:30.400]
hours to watch a movie.

[02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:31.620]
I'm not going to invest that much

[02:30:31.620 --> 02:30:33.040]
of my time, especially with

[02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:34.060]
a limited amount of time I got

[02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:35.420]
left watching something that I

[02:30:35.420 --> 02:30:36.300]
think is I'm going to hate.

[02:30:37.240 --> 02:30:38.520]
I was not a fan of Johnny Cash

[02:30:38.520 --> 02:30:40.060]
either, but this Phoenix guy

[02:30:40.060 --> 02:30:41.220]
obviously did a good job in the

[02:30:41.220 --> 02:30:42.360]
film, this Phoenix guy.

[02:30:42.980 --> 02:30:43.900]
He don't even, he can't even

[02:30:43.900 --> 02:30:45.140]
pronounce spell Joaquin.

[02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:48.220]
Hey, like that, this Phoenix

[02:30:48.220 --> 02:30:49.780]
guy, which one?

[02:30:51.140 --> 02:30:52.060]
Whatever guy was on

[02:30:52.060 --> 02:30:52.360]
Letterman.

[02:30:53.260 --> 02:30:54.380]
There are many movies that you

[02:30:54.380 --> 02:30:55.560]
refuse to watch for one reason

[02:30:55.560 --> 02:30:56.620]
or another, and I think you

[02:30:56.620 --> 02:30:57.520]
should keep a moral, but my

[02:30:57.520 --> 02:30:59.020]
like George and Flea and give

[02:30:59.020 --> 02:31:00.180]
some of those films a try.

[02:31:01.020 --> 02:31:02.420]
But here comes the best part.

[02:31:03.140 --> 02:31:04.460]
But I do agree with you on the

[02:31:04.460 --> 02:31:04.960]
Jonas kid.

[02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:05.900]
I'm an old purve too.

[02:31:06.060 --> 02:31:07.020]
Thanks, Neil, love your show.

[02:31:07.240 --> 02:31:08.260]
Gatehead and Wilton Manor.

[02:31:08.740 --> 02:31:09.460]
How do you like that?

[02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:09.940]
Well, guess what?

[02:31:10.040 --> 02:31:10.600]
I saw him first.

[02:31:10.740 --> 02:31:11.380]
You can't have him.

[02:31:11.940 --> 02:31:12.180]
Joey.

[02:31:12.760 --> 02:31:13.200]
Hey, Joey.

[02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:15.380]
Come on over, Joey.

[02:31:15.520 --> 02:31:16.240]
Let's have a little lunch.

[02:31:16.460 --> 02:31:17.160]
Let's have a little talk.

[02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:21.420]
Oh, I forgot to tell you who

[02:31:21.420 --> 02:31:21.680]
died.

[02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:22.620]
Well, they're coming out of the

[02:31:22.620 --> 02:31:24.140]
track for the second race of

[02:31:24.140 --> 02:31:24.440]
Gulf Stream.

[02:31:24.520 --> 02:31:25.420]
Nine minutes to post on.

[02:31:25.820 --> 02:31:26.580]
Both for art.

[02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:27.880]
Henry Colazo, in three-

[02:31:27.880 --> 02:31:27.980]
five minutes.

[02:31:27.980 --> 02:31:28.320]
Eight to five.

[02:31:28.440 --> 02:31:29.500]
Before we get set again, that's a

[02:31:29.500 --> 02:31:29.900]
good sign.

[02:31:30.060 --> 02:31:31.240]
He's taking steady money, baby.

[02:31:31.560 --> 02:31:32.260]
Three to one.

[02:31:32.440 --> 02:31:32.580]
Eight to five.

[02:31:32.660 --> 02:31:33.520]
That's about five six.

[02:31:33.520 --> 02:31:35.500]
My mom can mamba and Andrew Hall.

[02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:37.680]
But folks flocking to the four

[02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:38.320]
Calabria.

[02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:39.620]
They're flocking to Calabria,

[02:31:39.620 --> 02:31:40.960]
which is in Italy, you tell me.

[02:31:41.020 --> 02:31:41.620]
Yes, that's right.

[02:31:41.720 --> 02:31:42.940]
It's right down by Sicily.

[02:31:43.180 --> 02:31:44.300]
I didn't pick that one on top,

[02:31:44.420 --> 02:31:45.880]
but Calabria, beautiful town,

[02:31:46.140 --> 02:31:47.620]
been there years and years ago.

[02:31:47.800 --> 02:31:48.680]
But you know what?

[02:31:49.040 --> 02:31:50.280]
I'm going with the old number five

[02:31:50.280 --> 02:31:51.520]
in here, kissing code, Rolly.

[02:31:51.760 --> 02:31:52.780]
Because this one's going to stretch

[02:31:52.780 --> 02:31:54.000]
out the six-and-a-half for a

[02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:54.320]
long stretch.

[02:31:54.320 --> 02:31:54.900]
Yes, stretch this out.

[02:31:54.900 --> 02:31:55.440]
I'm going to have to go to the

[02:31:55.440 --> 02:31:57.080]
addition of Lasix with a second

[02:31:57.080 --> 02:31:58.580]
place finish and did that

[02:31:58.580 --> 02:32:00.080]
behind-o class drop of you.

[02:32:00.200 --> 02:32:01.000]
Remember this horse called

[02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:02.080]
I'm it Wayne.

[02:32:02.220 --> 02:32:03.060]
That was at five and a half

[02:32:03.060 --> 02:32:04.820]
for a long Alan Jerkins.

[02:32:05.020 --> 02:32:06.740]
Shannon Uski penciled him for

[02:32:06.740 --> 02:32:08.300]
the return assignment was facing

[02:32:08.300 --> 02:32:09.620]
better, I believe last time.

[02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:11.740]
Not pretty square price at three

[02:32:11.740 --> 02:32:12.780]
one, but like as you mentioned,

[02:32:12.940 --> 02:32:14.720]
everybody zeroed in on Calabria.

[02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:17.460]
Kissing code just needs to avoid

[02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:18.000]
the bounce.

[02:32:18.280 --> 02:32:20.080]
A very strong bounce on this.

[02:32:20.800 --> 02:32:21.600]
Avoid the bounce.

[02:32:23.140 --> 02:32:24.340]
That's something that they made

[02:32:24.340 --> 02:32:25.580]
up and threw away racing the

[02:32:25.580 --> 02:32:26.700]
bounce horse runs a big

[02:32:26.700 --> 02:32:26.920]
race.

[02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.460]
And all he's going to think

[02:32:28.460 --> 02:32:29.500]
the next time out the bounce

[02:32:29.500 --> 02:32:30.240]
bounce on this.

[02:32:31.680 --> 02:32:33.060]
Singer Estelle Bennett, one of the

[02:32:33.060 --> 02:32:34.720]
original members of the 60s group

[02:32:34.720 --> 02:32:36.240]
the Ronets has died at the age of

[02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:38.000]
67, said her sister Rony

[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:38.440]
Specter.

[02:32:39.660 --> 02:32:41.920]
The Ronets Estelle has gone,

[02:32:42.100 --> 02:32:43.080]
Specter said and posted on her

[02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:44.640]
website, did it Wednesday, to my

[02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:45.800]
beloved sister, rest in peace.

[02:32:45.880 --> 02:32:46.420]
You deserve it.

[02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:48.660]
Don't we all deserve to rest in

[02:32:48.660 --> 02:32:48.920]
peace?

[02:32:49.880 --> 02:32:50.900]
Well, most of us.

[02:32:51.020 --> 02:32:52.100]
Not Jolly Jo Bello.

[02:32:54.580 --> 02:32:56.440]
No details of the cause of

[02:32:56.440 --> 02:32:57.160]
the location of Bennett's

[02:32:57.160 --> 02:32:57.620]
death were given.

[02:32:58.180 --> 02:32:59.480]
The Bennett Specter and her

[02:32:59.480 --> 02:33:00.820]
cousin Anita Talley were from

[02:33:00.820 --> 02:33:02.360]
the Washington Heights section of

[02:33:02.360 --> 02:33:03.980]
Manhattan and went on to perform

[02:33:03.980 --> 02:33:04.740]
as the Ronets.

[02:33:06.160 --> 02:33:07.140]
Recording hits like Be My

[02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:08.120]
Baby and Walkin' in the Rain

[02:33:08.120 --> 02:33:09.660]
before breaking up in 1966.

[02:33:10.280 --> 02:33:11.120]
You could play it if you knew

[02:33:11.120 --> 02:33:11.980]
how to dittle Georgia's

[02:33:11.980 --> 02:33:12.740]
stuff there, but you don't.

[02:33:12.960 --> 02:33:13.800]
No, I try not to dittle

[02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:14.160]
this stuff.

[02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:15.800]
Oh, don't dittle Georgia's

[02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:16.020]
crap.

[02:33:16.480 --> 02:33:17.860]
Then it recreated one solo record

[02:33:17.860 --> 02:33:19.300]
the year 2000 the Naked Boy

[02:33:19.300 --> 02:33:20.700]
before she retired to raise a

[02:33:20.700 --> 02:33:22.000]
family of the New York

[02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:22.080]
Heights.

[02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:23.520]
The Ronets, you read it,

[02:33:23.640 --> 02:33:24.780]
it recreated only once for the

[02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:26.620]
2007 induction into the Rock

[02:33:26.620 --> 02:33:27.500]
and Roll Hall of Fame.

[02:33:28.420 --> 02:33:29.660]
Well, thank God she got in there

[02:33:29.660 --> 02:33:31.340]
before she croaked 67.

[02:33:31.720 --> 02:33:32.800]
She did not so old, especially

[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:33.720]
when you're 66.

[02:33:34.340 --> 02:33:35.220]
Let's do the break a little bit

[02:33:35.220 --> 02:33:36.000]
early so we don't get behind.

[02:33:36.880 --> 02:33:37.060]
Okay.

[02:33:37.860 --> 02:33:39.420]
On the big race at Gulf Stream.

[02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:40.720]
A lot of pressure on me.

[02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:41.920]
Airby Friday, boy, you're

[02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:42.220]
old.

[02:33:42.340 --> 02:33:43.440]
You can't handle this much pressure.

[02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:44.500]
Can you handle it?

[02:33:44.620 --> 02:33:45.200]
I'll give it a shot.

[02:33:45.540 --> 02:33:46.480]
Let's see what the board looks

[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:46.700]
like.

[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:48.620]
One, the entry is four to one.

[02:33:49.500 --> 02:33:50.880]
Four, still the chalk nine to

[02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:51.940]
five, the five, three to one,

[02:33:51.940 --> 02:33:53.180]
and the six is taking a

[02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:53.580]
little action.

[02:33:53.960 --> 02:33:55.700]
Look at that three to one.

[02:33:55.940 --> 02:33:56.860]
The six is taking a

[02:33:56.860 --> 02:33:57.640]
late money and the four just

[02:33:57.640 --> 02:33:58.940]
went up to five to one.

[02:33:59.040 --> 02:33:59.640]
Oh, no.

[02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:01.100]
Yes, I'm about to heart.

[02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:02.440]
Well, the O'Rodgers guy.

[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:03.780]
The hottest show on Earth is

[02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:05.360]
back as contestants from around

[02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:06.920]
the USA battle to become the

[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:09.100]
next American Spillie Idol.

[02:34:10.660 --> 02:34:13.780]
I'm all out of home.

[02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:15.840]
One more bad,

[02:34:15.860 --> 02:34:18.440]
hadry, he could bring it

[02:34:19.780 --> 02:34:20.460]
to you right now,

[02:34:20.460 --> 02:34:21.520]
but somebody please kill me.

[02:34:21.620 --> 02:34:23.100]
That was truly horrible.

[02:34:23.180 --> 02:34:25.440]
I'm about to feel like

[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:27.600]
I can't

[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:28.860]
am I?

[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:30.280]
It's a

[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:31.920]
last evening run wide

[02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:32.960]
waiting.

[02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:35.440]
Oh, I just

[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:39.180]
wanted your name is B-I-L-L-L-I-E.

[02:34:39.440 --> 02:34:41.360]
That's such a great touch,

[02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:44.600]
but your lip is a little off.

[02:34:45.020 --> 02:34:47.740]
And I will have more spikes

[02:34:47.740 --> 02:34:49.620]
on your jacket, you know.

[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:52.940]
Oh, here she comes now saying,

[02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:54.300]
moan and moan.

[02:34:54.760 --> 02:34:56.820]
Hello everyone, this is the real Billy Idol.

[02:34:57.080 --> 02:34:58.060]
I'm not American.

[02:34:58.340 --> 02:35:01.560]
Shoot him down, turn around and come on, moan.

[02:35:01.740 --> 02:35:04.820]
But someone will be crowned the next American Billy Idol.

[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:07.300]
Okay, what excellent timing, by the way,

[02:35:07.300 --> 02:35:08.000]
if I say so myself.

[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:09.600]
The fourth and the Tampa just finished,

[02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:11.900]
and the three worst one by about 500 lengths.

[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:14.620]
And now we got the minute to go to post time

[02:35:14.620 --> 02:35:16.680]
for our second race at Gulfstream.

[02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:17.240]
You excited?

[02:35:17.480 --> 02:35:17.880]
Yeah, very.

[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:18.720]
No, you're not.

[02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:19.020]
No.

[02:35:19.940 --> 02:35:21.880]
You'd be a lot more excited if you had like 100 to win.

[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:22.840]
Now let's see what the odds are.

[02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:23.460]
Five to two.

[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:24.560]
We still the favorite to four.

[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:26.700]
He went up to five to one and then came back down.

[02:35:27.220 --> 02:35:27.820]
Five to two.

[02:35:27.860 --> 02:35:28.900]
That's a $7.00 house.

[02:35:29.860 --> 02:35:32.760]
$50, $7.00, $375 for art.

[02:35:32.940 --> 02:35:33.660]
If we if he wins.

[02:35:33.780 --> 02:35:33.960]
Nice.

[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:35.820]
If not, our best wishes.

[02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:41.880]
This is a great email as the horses are going to the post.

[02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:44.020]
About the bitch with all the kids.

[02:35:44.620 --> 02:35:44.940]
Yeah.

[02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:47.380]
Todd says this week reminds me of the Groucho Marx line

[02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:49.540]
when he had a woman on you bet your life with 12 children.

[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:52.100]
He asked her why, and she said she loved children.

[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:54.940]
Groucho said, well, lady, I love my cigar,

[02:35:55.340 --> 02:35:57.160]
but at least I take it out of my mouth once in a while.

[02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:01.260]
You don't like that?

[02:36:01.860 --> 02:36:02.320]
It was cute.

[02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:04.140]
Wow.

[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:07.060]
You are a hard-ass, Mr. I thought that was funny as hell.

[02:36:08.020 --> 02:36:10.140]
I love my cigar, but at least I take it out of my mouth

[02:36:10.140 --> 02:36:10.900]
every once in a while.

[02:36:11.020 --> 02:36:11.800]
Well, they're going to the gate.

[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:14.240]
That golf stream.

[02:36:15.860 --> 02:36:17.380]
Less than a minute for post time.

[02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:21.060]
The one, the entry is a seven to two, the one and one eight.

[02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:22.580]
Two is six to one.

[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:23.600]
Three is 45 to one.

[02:36:23.660 --> 02:36:24.080]
No shot.

[02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:24.840]
Four.

[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:25.560]
The truck.

[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:26.200]
Five to two.

[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:27.740]
The five is three to one.

[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:29.020]
Six is seven to two.

[02:36:29.300 --> 02:36:33.160]
And the outside three to seven eight and nine are box cars.

[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:33.700]
Big numbers.

[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:34.340]
No chance.

[02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:37.340]
Little chance.

[02:36:37.980 --> 02:36:39.740]
Don't ever say no chance because if they're in the race

[02:36:39.740 --> 02:36:40.320]
they got a shot.

[02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:42.060]
Like that 30 to one shot that one that one day.

[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:44.120]
Beat our horse up two weeks ago, remember?

[02:36:44.380 --> 02:36:44.580]
Yeah.

[02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:45.640]
That would have been nice paid in.

[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:47.680]
Well, who the hell is going to pick that?

[02:36:48.980 --> 02:36:50.180]
That piece of turd.

[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:54.480]
Kevin says Hank did indeed call it a day in show yesterday gave his opinion

[02:36:54.480 --> 02:36:56.180]
to the best movie scene ever shot in South Florida.

[02:36:56.600 --> 02:36:58.840]
His choice was a scene from Goldfinger with Sean Connery.

[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:02.720]
I guess even Hank knows that Mandage his week these days have a good one

[02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:03.780]
and he'll sign the fake Kevin.

[02:37:03.940 --> 02:37:04.160]
Right.

[02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:08.440]
Well, that's interesting because we got two people to say called in,

[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:11.100]
which I don't believe and one who say he called it off the air.

[02:37:11.460 --> 02:37:12.260]
That's very credible.

[02:37:13.220 --> 02:37:17.840]
They're going to the gate if they ever were to decide to get this horse and buggy thing going here.

[02:37:19.180 --> 02:37:19.860]
Oh no buggy.

[02:37:19.980 --> 02:37:20.600]
That's a liver.

[02:37:20.780 --> 02:37:21.620]
It has moved in.

[02:37:21.700 --> 02:37:22.320]
Well, there you go.

[02:37:24.100 --> 02:37:24.820]
Like Calabria.

[02:37:24.900 --> 02:37:25.940]
That's the name of the game.

[02:37:26.260 --> 02:37:27.300]
4 or 5 to 2 Calabria.

[02:37:27.460 --> 02:37:28.380]
It's an Italy code.

[02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:32.680]
And the five is also 5 to 2, but the four is just a few bucks.

[02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:34.480]
I have a mumbo going in.

[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:36.000]
Mumbo the mumbo.

[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:37.280]
There's Calabria.

[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:38.680]
There's Calabria.

[02:37:39.900 --> 02:37:41.720]
Over there by Sicily, Sicilia.

[02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:44.200]
Getting to get you idiot.

[02:37:45.540 --> 02:37:46.620]
Calabria is going to wrong direction.

[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:47.480]
The next one.

[02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:48.080]
There we go.

[02:37:52.140 --> 02:37:53.600]
And through all of the.

[02:37:53.620 --> 02:37:54.620]
Pension you could cut it with a butter knife.

[02:37:54.780 --> 02:37:54.980]
Couldn't you?

[02:37:55.340 --> 02:37:56.360]
I'm on the edge of my seat.

[02:37:56.960 --> 02:37:58.580]
Waiting for word in edgewise.

[02:37:58.600 --> 02:37:59.780]
Over cracking of dreams.

[02:38:03.740 --> 02:38:04.180]
Yeah.

[02:38:07.020 --> 02:38:09.940]
King of dreams coming up to the outside stall.

[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:11.340]
Then they're all in.

[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:14.160]
Not.

[02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:15.440]
Get in there, you idiot.

[02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:17.440]
Oh my god.

[02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:21.340]
Are they in?

[02:38:22.140 --> 02:38:22.740]
Are they out?

[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:26.940]
Yeah, what happened?

[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:28.140]
They're in the gate.

[02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:29.960]
Just relax.

[02:38:30.180 --> 02:38:31.380]
Don't get all pent up with emotion.

[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:31.820]
Sorry.

[02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:33.580]
It's not your 50 bucks to win.

[02:38:33.580 --> 02:38:35.140]
And they're all in line.

[02:38:35.420 --> 02:38:36.020]
All in line.

[02:38:37.100 --> 02:38:37.500]
And.

[02:38:38.740 --> 02:38:39.140]
And.

[02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:39.280]

[02:38:39.340 --> 02:38:40.260]
Dreams not quite in there.

[02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:40.500]
Yeah.

[02:38:40.500 --> 02:38:40.960]
Oh boy.

[02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:44.140]
Get them in there.

[02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:45.420]
Quit the crap and around.

[02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:46.220]
No problem.

[02:38:46.220 --> 02:38:46.660]
Don't go down.

[02:38:46.940 --> 02:38:47.640]
Oh boy.

[02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:48.380]
Ready for the start.

[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:49.940]
And a way to go.

[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:50.880]
They're off.
