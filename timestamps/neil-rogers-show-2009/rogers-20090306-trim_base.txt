The stimulus package don't buy me says we need

[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.040]
Nothing more than pork and more political green

[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.500]
Saving banks that sank from their bad policy is more than 50 ways to waste our money

[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.640]
More than 50 ways to waste our money

[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.760]
millions for sex

[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.080]
50 million to fund

[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.800]
cash for green technology

[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.500]
Sounds boba's to me

[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.660]
Oh one billion more census

[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.440]
Don't make sense

[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.480]
You let's philosophy yes, man you're kidding me

[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.200]
Oh, let's bail out the bank so the CEO can get 50 million dollar bonus. What are you saying with our money? All right

[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.460]
We got a fake Facebook. We got that while back and

[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.300]
Thanks to my friend friend whatever his name is Ken up in atobico

[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.760]
He alerted me to the fact and not only alerted me, but he sent me a copy with some of the crap they're putting on there

[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.880]
Twitter we're on Twitter and fake Neil Roger show

[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.340]
site

[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.760]
page yep, and it's got all this updates George the great job. I was gone with a date in the time and

[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.440]
33 years in his business date in the time here I come would buy all this other crap. This is all bogus

[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.340]
Right fake Neil Roger show page on Twitter just like we got a fake Neil Roger show page on face fake fake book

[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.660]
There you go

[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.640]
God

[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.660]
Like you said about the internet's

[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.500]
Yep so many children and so little time and so many people with the same problem. I have no life mm-hmm

[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.700]
Well here's the here's

[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.660]
The annual email from mr. Ego

[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.400]
Maybe not every year, but every every couple years when he gets bored when he realizes

[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.340]
He's on a station and nobody ever heard of that they don't even show up at all in the ratings that he's basically

[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.480]
Falling off the face of the earth with his right wing clap trap

[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.040]
Here's the email that came in at 4.27 this morning

[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.700]
See you know it's got to be for real because nobody would wake up in the middle of the night

[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.320]
But when somebody works mornings in his up at that hour it makes all the sense in the world that it's real is real

[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.800]
From Steve Kane subject debate

[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.080]
Same old desperation

[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.540]
Disturbed some contrive controversy so that old Uncle Neil can put Steve back on the mat

[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.500]
Getting a little bit of attention so people know he's actually on the air or

[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.900]
Post-being on you

[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.920]
Hello Neil. I'm challenging you to a debate to be broadcast on 1470 or on WQM

[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.700]
This debate will be formatted like a battle of the local talk show hosts

[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.420]
I have asked on my show Tom jicca misspelled to be the monitor of the debate

[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.260]
I will read this challenge on the air every morning until you respond

[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.560]
I'm responding right now Steve. Oh, and just like it has been for all the other years

[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.820]
You've tried this crap the answer is still no I would I dignify him with a response no

[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.280]
You and I are the only original talk show host left here in South Florida to celebrate you're more than 25 years in the market as well as mine

[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.800]
What a better fit than the two of us engaged in debate over game marriage. I await your answer god bless you Steve

[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.840]
My answer is no absolutely

[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.220]
Absolutely positively no

[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.180]
I wouldn't waste my time I would even taking a breath in your direction

[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.500]
Oh

[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.780]
Is this pathetic or what yeah?

[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.220]
always challenging you to a debate

[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.140]
And then you tell me that when you do your appearances the guy with the eyes and the guy with a fanny pack come by on on behalf of the mr

[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.160]
Ego show and

[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.140]
The challenge you to Brian Craig wants to debate George a lot of things

[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.380]
I mean talk about silliness uh-huh talk about nonsense why why in the world would we dignify them?

[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.920]
They don't even show up. They don't make a blip on a rickere scale

[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:14.540]
And that's what they're praying for oh please Neil please dignify me with a response put me on let somebody really hear me no

[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.920]
No, you're done. I think you ever was much, but you're done

[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.120]
I wish y'all the luck in the world and continue to grind out a living and during these tough economic times

[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.040]
I know you got 45 kids to support, but I got one

[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:36.340]
I got one unofficially adopted uh child and it cost me a lot of money lots of money plus a couple of other people that I have to support

[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.160]
I don't have to but I do willingly and lovingly because I'm a great guy

[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.600]
And I sure as hell not interested in promoting mr. Ego with contrived garbage with clap track

[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.200]
I'm gonna keep promoting it every day and this way go ahead

[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.300]
What I really meant to say I'm sorry

[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.620]
What I really meant to say was

[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.600]
Go ahead

[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.440]
In fact, uh, I was skinny on the elevator last night in my building and

[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.400]
There was you know somebody else at the elevator door way to get on right at the simultaneously with me

[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.620]
And I said go ahead and that's that came to my mind as soon as I said it I

[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.700]
Yeah, I say it all day long. Do you go ahead? Go ahead

[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:26.980]
Well, here's an astonishing piece of news that goes to show you the old man isn't as far out of touch with reality as some of you think

[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.620]
Thank you, Steven Jersey for sending me this by the way

[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.920]
Maddo forced to glam up. Hmm

[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.440]
I don't know what this is from but nevertheless it's a story from some publication Rachel Maddo's reluctant makeover

[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.640]
Rachel Maddo has been forced to glam up says Louise France in the London Observer with her six foot frame

[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.760]
Boyish appearance. I think what they mean is ducky appearance

[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.820]
The MSNBC host is long joke that she has a face made for radio where she started her career

[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.560]
I'm an unusual looking person Maddo says. I'm not a TV anchor bag babe. I'm a big lesbian who looks like a man

[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.740]
But now that Maddo is in fact the anchor of her own program

[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.580]
She's had to make adjustments reluctantly agreeing to wear a makeup and what she caused lady clothes

[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.500]
You see it wasn't just me imagining that she looked real ducky

[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.900]
And that she wasn't wearing any makeup and she was going out of her way to look as manly and gross as possible

[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:29.240]
As it turns out many viewers men and women alike now consider her a sex symbol judging by her fan mail and all the internet chatter

[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.180]
You consider her a sex symbol

[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.620]
Me you talk to me. Yeah

[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.020]
Yeah, people are kind and flattering. She says but it's remarkable and weird

[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.460]
Part of my life that I try not to dwell on the fact that she's a real pasty looking

[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.960]
Ducky and goes out of her way to accentuate the negative

[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.500]
She doesn't admit that she's become more aware of her appearance even if the issue is still great on her

[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.620]
I get exasperated my goal is to do the physical appearance stuff in such a way that it's not comment worthy

[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.780]
I don't think very much about my appearance and when I do it's not how would you say strategic she laughs

[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.840]
It's not strategic she laughs

[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.860]
But it's a visual medium and it really does matter what you look like she's finally come to that conclusion

[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.960]
They've convinced her it does matter. We don't want some pasty looking dyke on the air with no makeup no

[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.620]
lipstick no nail polish looking really butch

[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:23.600]
butch

[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.620]
Just because you were a dyke. I mean there's nothing wrong with being a dyke

[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.520]
But Jesus that doesn't mean you have to go out of your way to prove it. We believe you

[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.920]
Don't we don't we believe she's a pasty dyke

[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:40.640]
Yeah, we believe it but that's a put out a little bit of lipstick and mascara and rouge and look like a who are you to tell a

[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.660]
Well, she's doing it. How's she doing it? They told her already

[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:51.500]
Because they know for damn sure that they'll cut you know, it's got at least one eye and can see can see the crap they put on there

[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.660]
Not to mention the fact that she's a very weak

[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.920]
Keith Obermann the second that was up 61 points

[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.560]

[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.300]
Kaka time it seemed to me that he was sending me some

[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.140]
Ken says Ken from Atobikos says because I emailed the back as he deats a fake the Twitter

[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:32.520]

[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.600]
I better watch myself

[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.400]

I'm not sure if that's Cliff from Kendall, but

[00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.500]

So he'll be the chalk. I don't like the chalk anyway. You like chalk? No, we had that all chalk double last week and you cashed

[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.060]
But not too much I had a dream the other night

[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.060]
Yeah, that I picked a

[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.400]
Horse with a big price like 25 to 1 or something and he won by open lengths

[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.740]
And I'm trying to do the math in my head and all the our contestant winning about them with me. Yeah, like that was it was good

[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.320]
It was just a dream though, of course

[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.740]

[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.160]
I think he gave us control of that now

[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:47.640]
Control of what how are you gonna fix it? I think I got control of it. What's it supposed to say? Oh, I don't know how to why no

[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.860]
Didn't you put it up previously

[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.100]
Why but you're right it was on there. No, it's not correct

[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:04.260]
Though what which occupation which is supposedly macho is a lot of closet queens is what the question is I don't know how it was worded

[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.980]
Maybe Erick can get it back the way it belongs

Call now the feces of the species collection is going fast

[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.560]
Oh, I know it's one. I heard a boys and bury in the middle of that thing. I didn't

[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.640]
I open a window that was it

[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.140]
I open the window, but not nearly enough. I guess really it's so stuffy

[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.260]
Stuffy in here. Do the show outside and get some circulation. Do the one do the show outside today

[00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:01.780]

[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.180]
Let's see here's a one from Rooley

[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.660]
After hearing the email you read about her glaming up the commercial I heard yesterday makes sense

[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:18.060]
I heard Rachel Maddo last night doing a radio spot for cosmetics. I figured it was a comedy bit

[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.800]
Common her doing beauty spots common

[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:28.980]
Her doing beauty spots is like George W. Doing spots for men's uh by the way happy 33rds is Rooley

[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.160]
Thanks Rooley. Pulley whoever you are

[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.300]
When you hear this next one it's going to make the mr. ego email pale under one significance

[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.820]
Neil at nearogers.com by the way for all your emails observations commentaries and crap

[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.760]
Get let me give you a guess who this next one is allegedly from

[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.060]
Connick caller Joe Rocho

[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.440]
Story yeah

[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.340]
Excellent job George with very little just a tiny clue

[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:06.700]
Hi, Neil my name is Stormcat. I'm a big part of the Joe Rocho. I call every day and Joe and I have little conversation and that's all

[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.020]
I don't know why you have an issue with that because your calls suck. That's why

[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:18.740]
Because nobody wants to hear the same jackass call the same show day after day after day and pretty much at the same time usually too

[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:29.600]
Nobody wants to hear that whether it's richie from Boris head mark the jets fan stormy nobody wants to listen to a radio show where the same idiot calls every I'm your friend every day

[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.100]
You've been calling me off for two weeks and I didn't want to email you but I'm tired of it

[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.380]
Yesterday you were talking about something in the word storm came up

[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:43.180]
And all of a sudden you started to go off. No, I did not the word storm never came up and I didn't go off on anything. Did I?

[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.040]
No

[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.200]
No

[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.980]
Stormy stormy don't ever call the station stormy. Please leave me alone Neil

[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.940]
You even talked to the beast about me when he was there. I was listening

[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.280]
I'm a sports guy. I's whenever called you but you've been hating on me man. You've been hating on me

[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.540]
If I've been hating on stormy

[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.560]
Yeah, you're a hater

[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:09.140]
To drink in that heater aid Eric still hasn't corrected the pool. I'm not chatting with him about that as we speak

[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:14.520]
I mean, we got it. Otherwise, it's meaningless. And let's uh, we get the poll question on there, right

[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.080]
Right

[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.200]
How does that happen all of a sudden? We don't know

[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.660]
What we don't know

[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.200]
Well, so what's he gonna do that? I don't know fix it

[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.480]
How can he do that with magic? Okay, techno magic. Clunk your magic twang or froggy

[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.140]
Please leave me alone you leave it talk to beast yet. Uh, I haven't even called you in two days because of you

[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:44.880]

[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.800]
And now it's giving away those gains

[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.860]
You know my cab guy and I we talk about this a lot my lesbian ease cab driver

[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.080]
About what a what a fraud the stock market has become over the last many years

[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:08.820]
You know what really started becoming fraudulent when CNBC went on here those people belong in prison

[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:13.160]
Including you Maria with diarrhea you belong in jail on death row

[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:19.120]
Pedaling crap. Oh, it's a buying opportunity. It's always a buying opportunity. It's never a selling opportunity

[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.660]
It's always a buying opportunity

[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:25.000]
In fact, I got an email about her about some crap she was peddling the other day

[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.620]
It's in my pile. I'll get to it Maria

[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:38.760]
Since they went on a year and they're nonstop 24 seven peddling peddling peddling peddling peddling and the reason they keep peddling is because if people stop buying stock then they're out of business

[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.900]
Am I right? You bet

[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:49.160]
Abso freaking lootly a fool and his money are soon parted

[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:54.840]
Once upon a time when I was like a little kid you'd invest, you know, in the stock market was for investing in making money

[00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.340]
You would invest in like what were really great companies back then, you know general motors. Oh

[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:01.560]
Kodak

[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:10.400]
General electric and you'd make money you you're in dividends you'd make money and over a period of years your your investment would grow and

[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.260]
You'd make some cash now big scam

[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:20.040]
Every time you turn around to housing bubble. It's the tech bubble. It's the uh soap bubble

[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.280]
It's some other damn bubble. It's bubble the love sponge who didn't do squat by the way

[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.500]
Now realize he was only on one month of the trend and the arbitrage is usually a month behind

[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.620]
So the next trend will see if he made any progress

[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:41.820]
But Paul and Ron actually went up and he did nothing he did squasky they have Paul and Ron had a 5.1 share and the state

[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.960]
He's on whatever the hell it is had a 1.7

[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.920]
That's that's more than triple isn't it? It's triple. Okay

[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.560]
I'm a cripple if it ain't triple. I'm telling you

[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:58.140]
Well, what kind of a number is that 1.7 that he was supposed to goose up their number above it lost bunch

[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:05.520]
I guess they're not promoting him at all because you know who's got money to promote and I guess uh the people in the trailer park seven discovered him yet

[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.560]
The trailer trash the Tampa crowd, you know the red necks the Yehu's

[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.260]
I don't know I can't comment on his show because I've never heard it all

[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:20.660]
I know as I've heard some commentary from people who've got an IQ larger than their thumbnail and they say it blows

[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:26.340]
It blows it blows it blows and if Paul and young Ron are beating the crap out of him. What does that tell you

[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.940]
using recycling my material

[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.260]
The pole still says the same thing

[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:42.040]
Oh, there we go. That's why Eric. Thank you. Which occupation or trade though mochomacho is also a breeding ground for those in the closet

[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:47.020]
Very good. Thank you Eric. What will we do without Eric? We wouldn't have a show. We wouldn't have a life

[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.020]
Oh

[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.340]
This is hysterical

[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:56.820]
Roger Kaputnikin focuses. I've seen a lot of whispers in my day, but never one is cowardly as you debate Steve

[00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:01.820]
It will get the biggest ratings in years and prove you once and for all that right is right and wrong is wrong

[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.640]
Grow some testicles pansy. Yo, yeah right is right

From South Floridian's losing their jobs to homeowners trying to fight for a closure to stimulus bills. It's a lot to deal with

[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:35.160]
Oh, this is just a puff piece for a South Florida's first news and I would they don't need any publicity from us

[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.940]
Okay, they had a big big-ass book

[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.580]
Not that Jimmy would care because Jimmy seems oblivious to his

[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.080]
lack of ability in the broadcast medium

[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.040]

[00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:00.680]
Sexual relationship with the underage female he met at a swimming related event. Well, he's spread it around

[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:07.480]
Assist in US attorney Brent Tantillo declined to elaborate. He said investigation was ongoing

[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.900]
Caragall worked at pinecrest from 2006. He was arrested November

[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:17.000]
He previously coached boy swimming at Sacriss Bay High School in western and several swim clubs

[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.040]
think earth swim think earth swim

[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:21.780]
What do you say?

[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.000]
Yes, ink or swim think what do you what do you think?

[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:31.440]
That was up six point it's it's going to be a negative territory soon Maria it's going to be a negative territory

[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:39.060]
66 just over 66 hundred of the freaking Dow and a few weeks ago was 14,000

[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.000]
Here comes the bunny and air goes your money

[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.480]
For it a big pile of Schmidt is what we're in

[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:55.100]
So anyway, here's that ticket pull fake Barry Jackass sent it to me. Thank you Barry

[00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:02.900]
Who is the worst local radio play by play announcer? I'm sure there's an update on this and how come on the ticket unlike our pool

[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.740]
Where we show the numbers of votes they show percentages

[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.260]
I

[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:18.100]
Think that when people only show percentages they know what should know how few votes they're getting on exactly right I could be what you're exactly right

[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:27.580]
And how come Gildey's not on here, huh? Maybe he's got some inside buddies over there across the street from his five weeks that he worked there

[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:33.660]
So they don't want to put Gildey on there. He's weak. I watched quite a bit of the panther lost last night. He's weak

[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.760]
And Denise potpan

[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:42.140]
He's got to get paid by the syllable not just by the word that dumb frog my god never shuts up

[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.320]
He's like the Pierre McGuire of South Florida

[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:51.280]
And one time he's rambling on about something in Gildey interjected and tried to call you know

[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.900]
Whatever the play was on the ice and then Denise interrupted him so he can go back to talking about his crap

[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.440]
Whatever was his inane garbage you're an idiot Denise

[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.280]
I

[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:07.520]
Remember that I feel really really shmitty thing that was just how dumb can you be to say that on here?

[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.980]
All I talked to Doug this morning and you said I feel really really shmitty

[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.660]
Only he didn't put the em in shmitty right this is on a on a on television on a sports cast

[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.700]
Rumor said he almost fell out of the booth never rumored. Oh, yeah, I remember him

[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.000]
Coming back soon

[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.660]
Come on

[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:32.300]
Who is the worst local radio play by plan answer is that what they're asking across the street Jimmy syphilis

[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.700]
51 and a half percent

[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.520]
Oh just crushing the competition

[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.700]
Mike ingress. I have no idea who he is he's got only 0.4%

[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:47.780]
Dave and Horan has only got 0.3% which is embarrassing because he's is boring is

[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:53.900]
Randy Moher silly red deer Randy's got 2.7% Joseph got got got got got got got got got he he's got 13

[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.540]
0.6% he's a comfortable third and Jeremy Marx peltz. I have no idea who he is 31.5%

[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:04.980]
He must be a heat guy or something. Do you know who that is Jeremy Marx peltz? No, maybe flee knows who it is

[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:10.300]
Maybe fleeo come running and say oh he's the guy does the heat on whatever

[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.740]
On a radio and gildey's not even on here

[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:20.160]
I don't understand that do you understand why gildey is not on this list

[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:25.800]
like I said because he's probably got some bunk butt buddies over there across the street from the five minutes

[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.420]
He worked there

[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.660]
I don't see him on our schedule for this weekend. We got DA Saturday tomorrow 2 to 5

[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:37.100]
Right in the middle of it and Kevin Rogers 5 to 6 to 50 wow

[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:47.020]
Adam Coopersteen Sunday morning 9 to noon boy and the beast at marklight stating before the baseball game from noon to 12.50

[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.720]
I don't think about clearance man he sticks that beast in there anywhere he's

[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.940]
Anywhere he's slide him in there you know what I mean?

[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.320]
Raccoon anywhere he's slide him in any what a picture he works him in

[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:03.200]
So what do you think about that? Miss syphilis 51.5% of the listeners to the sports nerds across the street

[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:08.440]
Think you're the worst local radio play-by-play announcer and you may not be the worst, but you're sure right there in the hunt

[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.980]
You and Joseph get get get get get get get get get get get oh my god. I don't know who Jeremy Marx peltz is

[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.880]
I wonder if anybody will email me and tell me

[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.440]
Since George is out of the loop on the scrap maybe they will

[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:30.540]
I think you should do a poll to find out how many people in south-throwed are in the closet says yoldi

[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.280]
Uh the fake yoldi

[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.940]
How do we do that? How do we find out how many people are in the closet?

[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:46.720]
Start kelting huh start counting I see go in the closet there with them. Uno dos trace. Let's get the Scotty-Macti

[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.100]
You know

[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.840]
It's why do you best do really time for your animal?

[00:31:54.320 --> 00:32:00.380]
Geez mom. Not another animal kids just hate getting animals and mom's a giving them

[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:03.400]
But now there's a brand new animal that kids just love

[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:09.160]
Introducing you M&Animals the candy coated chocolate animal that makes getting cleaned out fun. Hey mom

[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.880]
Can I have another animal? I don't know Billy that makes your third animal today. Please

[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.500]
Well, okay cool

[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:22.820]
And this time I want a green one. Oh, sorry son. I took all the green ones. I did my two boys

[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:31.040]
New M&Animals melts in your butt not in your head 16 to 11 at 5 60 WM so the beast came through for me nobody else

[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.500]
Good nobody else my canvas is the heat

[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:39.060]
And Jeremy Marx peltz what we got a facts

[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.080]
Jeremy Marx peltz is played by play for FIU

[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:47.400]
He's also a sports nerd over across the street and yet he got the strong second place

[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:53.840]
31.5% of their 10 votes they got but Jimmy Cifil is just demolishing the competition

[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.080]
As the worst local play by play an answer

[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.580]
They hate you Jimmy. They're on to you. You suck

[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.300]
That clip that fat Chris played that one day or was it fat Chris? It was it whoever played it

[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.920]
I think it was that was unbelievable unbelievable

[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.640]
No, he ends up all off to number 83 and he runs

[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.340]
For a touchdown. What's going on?

[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:25.340]
Somebody silly people, you know silly people this business attracts it like Mr. Ego with his contrabossi

[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.740]
Phil arc says in my previous email I forgot to gloat about all the chalk results of last week

[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:42.580]
You mocked me in my stats 45% chalk winning percentage and what happens? I was right

[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:46.200]
Yeah, but I hate to break the news to you Phil arc, but when I picked the 11th horse last Friday

[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:51.320]
He was five to one in the morning line. He was the third choice. How the hell was I gonna know he was gonna go off heavy chalk?

[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:57.040]

Two weeks ago and one for kegs south of Kendall from land this the last week

Wtq.m.com got it got it. We got a winner yet or what? I don't know you you think so

[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.200]
I'm sure within seconds

[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:27.600]
Well, don't I'm not asking how are you sure? I'm not asking for an opinion all right well then

[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:31.100]
I'm asking if we got another winner on q.a.m. Bob. I remember that jingle

[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:35.620]
Yeah, we got another winner whatever that was back when q.m. was you could hear it

[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.740]
Back when it had a signal and back when it had an audience

[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.760]
Two things in this business that are really helpful

[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.920]
We got no mom we don't have a winner no

[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.660]
What language are you speaking mister? No, no, no

[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:56.300]
Really?

[00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.740]
All was starting to answer the question, but then you cut me off so no, go ahead no

[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.660]
The answer you don't have five collars no

[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:13.940]
You've got to be joking me. I was starting to say I'm sure within seconds or maybe a minute

[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.760]
The door will be opening and Lee will tell us who the winner is but not yeah, but not you well

[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.560]
We don't need to know who the winner is

[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.940]
But he'll tell me he'll open the door and give me a

[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:30.620]
Caller number five right now 800 227 05 60 wins a $50 significant East City Grille, Weston. How come we don't have a winner yet?

[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.340]

[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.280]
Yeah, you got one yet

[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:56.880]
No

[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:08.180]
You're you're playing with my mind you're you're playing with my emotions exactly what I'm doing I'm jerking you around

[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.460]
How's that possible?

[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:18.320]
$50 certificate for free for free for flizz crowd

[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.440]
Maybe that number is disconnected

[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:26.900]
I'm sorry the number you're calling was disconnected 10 years ago and it's just another QAM scam

[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:32.820]
1 800 227 05 will it we have a winner finally

[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:37.040]
The fact that I had to push that I mean that that's that's embarrassing

[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:42.260]
There wasn't bad enough. We got those ratings yesterday, but you can't complain about our ratings since we don't have any

[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.960]
We are vanishing from the dial

[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.460]
Well the signal that's really vile

[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:55.160]
I'm gonna go dump a pile how do you like that? I don't really need to but I'll maybe I can work one up

[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.960]
All right jump up and down a little bit

[00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.280]
Do the twist

[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:05.560]
Phil Arx says heard you mentioned the radio trends lab bastard killing QAM in the afternoons and all the rest which if you remember

[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.460]
Uh, I warned Joe Bell about

[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.920]
No, he warned Joe Bell about but I didn't hear you mentioned anything about Bubba versus Paul and young Ron's new rivalry

[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.340]
Well, you must not have been listening very carefully because I talked about it yesterday. I talked about it already this morning

[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:23.480]
Is he beginning to make in-roars into their audience none they went up and he did nothing

[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.100]
There show used to be six hours long and five hours long in this week

[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.860]
It just became four hours is this related to the trends no

[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:34.540]
Maybe they came to their senses over there because nobody does a five or six hours show. Maybe that's what it's related to

[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.860]
They kick his ass big time

[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.100]
They wiped the wall with his bloody Tampa ass

[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:48.320]
And then this nonsense. I can't wait to hear what you have to say about Santa need to oaks in the Santa need to Derby this weekend

[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.380]
I have nothing to say because I don't care about either one of them

[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:54.600]
Please announce what hour you'll be handicapping these two races along with the Gulf Stream race today

[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.040]
ah

[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:01.900]
And also why does Don Sherry Hadovetskin he has to amin he's having great season because he's a Russian

[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:09.460]
That's why he's European he hates all European players and any excuse will come up with to knock Europeans because he's a he's a bigoted old

[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.780]
Coot and his act is as stale as last year's Hadova

[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:18.880]
Keep keep mentioning a lot of other stuff that nobody cares about Phil Arches Phil Arches

[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.400]
He's part of the

[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.300]
Cotary of enemies which we have so many

[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.200]
Getting back to the pool Laurie and Baltimore says please add sailor to the pool

[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.480]
Which I know can't resist it do it hey sailor

[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:41.760]
My straight son was in the Navy told me there were a lot of gays in there that he knew as far as he knew no one ever bothered anybody about it

[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:48.880]
On the other hand one of my best friends who happens to be gay is the veteran of the Korean War he says he never got so much sex as he didn't the army

[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.480]
He also says there was no hassle about it either

[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:57.060]
Everyone knew who was gay and who was straight and nobody really cared that was his experience anyway back in the day happy Friday

[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.420]
You enjoyed Laurie and Baltimore

[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:27.840]
Y'all hate to break the news to Jimmy but since I mentioned that pull he's gone from 51 and a half percent as the worst

[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:33.380]
Local sportscaster to 86.3 percent you Jimmy they hate you

[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.340]
How do you like that and it goes to show you if we could change the percentage by that much and obviously we had an impact

[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.180]
That shows you how few votes that were on there. Oh

[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:46.380]

[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:26.000]
Which means 20 50 we might to be doing okay

[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:28.540]
We might have a shot at a couple of bucks in this book

[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.340]
I don't want to get your hopes all up but I'll hold my breath 10 to 3

[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:42.360]
And 18 plus in January Waxi 1.9 we had a 4.3 10 to 3 that is 10 to 2 you can be damn sure we had like close to a 5

Well, don't blame him. You know we got a lot of garbage and we got that as soon as that

[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:37.360]
Dolphin crap comes on 7 o'clock most nights. That's the end. This is the end

[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.000]
What's all the sudden stuff?

The 2554 forward towards I just put the stacks in the facts wow

[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:50.800]
Overall for the week 2554 persons we know we can't break it down to men because it's just a trend

[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:56.620]
That's what those zeros show up. I just had the day part day. Waxi 1.5 QAM 1.4 in January. I'm just looking to January

[00:57:59.240 --> 00:57:59.720]

Waxi 1.3 QAM 1. Oh, whoa

[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:08.260]
So there's there's something for citizen to crawl about

[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.800]

Seven of midnight Waxi 0.9 QAM 0.7

[00:58:52.560 --> 00:59:00.240]
In other words, what's the point? Well, those are some pretty amazing numbers those January numbers and we kicked some big fat smelly ass

[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:04.380]
With no signal with no promotion with no assistance with no nothing

[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:13.200]
We still rise heads and shoulders above the sports mong just like Le Bastard rises heads and shoulders above their sports mong

[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:14.740]
Among across the street

[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:17.280]

Just long ponderous crap

[00:59:55.040 --> 01:00:01.780]
Oh, yeah, here we go. Here we go more crap more anti-obama stuff

[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.320]
woman enversed by McNugget meltdown

[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:09.880]
Florida woman calls 9-11 three times after McDonald's runs out of McNuggets

[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.020]
Fort Pierce

[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:17.140]
She's been called McNut by TMZ.com and loco for poio by Perez Hilton.com

[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:23.280]
Now I have to be coming to an internet sensation for calling 9-11 three times to report an emergency after McDonald's

[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.220]
They run out of McNuggets a Fort Pierce woman said Wednesday she's embarrassed by all the media attention

[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:32.200]
I'm embarrassed to show my face in pubic La Trierse a Goodman told WPBF news

[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.520]
A day after her McNugget meltdown was first reported

[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.960]
Goodman 27 was issued a written notice to appear in court for misusing the 9-11 emergency

[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.240]
Communication system

[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:46.380]
According to the police report Goodman called 9-11 three times Saturday to report

[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:49.620]
A McDonald's in Floyd wasn't giving her a refund for the chicken McNuggets

[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:50.020]
She wanted

[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:52.900]
The manager just took my money won't give me my money back

[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:56.880]
I'm trying to make me get something off the menu that I don't want goodman said more than 9-11 calls

[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.440]
I ordered chicken McNuggets. They don't have chicken McNuggets

[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.620]
So I told her just give me my money back and she tells me I have to pick something else off the menu

[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:08.140]
She's not going to give me my money back and she doesn't have the right to take my money

[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.720]
Goodman told WPBF news 25 she didn't have a right to jump across the counter and snatch the money

[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.500]
So she chose to handle it another way

[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.640]
Inside edition was where was there when WPBF news 25 spoke to Goodman on Wednesday

[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:29.380]
She said all the media exposures resulted in several profanity-laced hateful messages on her personal cell phone good good

[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.300]
Crazy bitch

[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:35.220]
God it goes this goes on forever

[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.740]
I'm not going and just giving up my money like that

[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:41.680]
I'm going to go and ask them when they please check and see if they have what I wanted on the menu

[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.040]
And if they tell me yes, then I'll order she said and if not she'll make a big stink about it again

[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:52.640]
Oh, here's a really a great email. I hate the emails bring back the colors at least they were funny

[01:01:53.420 --> 01:02:00.320]
At least you were funny then what happened get out of Canada come back to banana republic where we all love you

[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:00.980]
Yes, screw you

[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:06.100]
I don't take orders okay on the internet or any place else. I'm not taking the instruction

[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.720]
Do this do that don't do this. Don't do that. Bye. Bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye

[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.140]
Screw you and do it twice

[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:16.820]
We're doing just fine. We just saw those January numbers. I and down to clearance say great job guys

[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.980]
Did he say did he give you a big kiss on the buttocks clearance isn't here

[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:25.260]
Well, we'll give you these trends flea. He went and got a key and broke into his office

[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.820]
Flea went and got a key. I always like that flea

[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.640]
Let's have a sitting ovation for flea.

[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.400]
Nice going, baby.

[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:32.480]
He's all right.

[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:33.420]
He's got a pair.

[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.580]
He's got a testicle or two or three.

[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.160]
Now are you understanding how we did so well in January?

[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.820]
And the sports nerds just, oh, yeah, you're not

[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:45.880]
seeing the cartwheels.

[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:46.900]
I got it out.

[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.100]
I mean, we had what?

[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:51.760]
We had a one three in the afternoon, persons to, oh, no,

[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.220]
that's men.

[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.860]
Let's get back to that person's 2554.

[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:55.980]
That is startling.

[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:57.080]
That is staggering.

[01:02:58.340 --> 01:02:59.840]
That's a feather in our crap.

[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:02.340]
Yelp.

[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:03.680]
Isn't it?

[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:04.320]
Yelp.

[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.620]
You don't seem pretty excited.

[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:08.620]
But the prospect, the prospect of maybe some bonus money.

[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:08.860]
Wait a minute.

[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:11.100]
Six to 10 a.m.

[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.000]
A one point is what we had.

[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:14.980]
Person's 2554.

[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.100]
Whoa, that would be about a two in men.

[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:18.780]
Just double it.

[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.140]
Two in men 2554.

[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:21.640]
That's weak.

[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.020]
We had a three nine.

[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:26.860]
That's about a seven point eight in men 2554.

[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.260]
That would qualify for numero uno.

[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.900]
Trust me when I tell you to put that life in their place.

[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:33.580]
Bastards at life.

[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:34.660]
They should only croak.

[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:37.700]
And the afternoon we had a 0.7.

[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.360]
Zero point seven.

[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:42.640]
What kind of a number starts with a bad one, I guess.

[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.080]
Bad, bad, bad one.

[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.280]
And January is not on here.

[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.340]
I guess clearance couldn't have scrapped

[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:53.080]
late at number that low.

[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.620]
The number I gave you for seven in midnight

[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.020]
was December.

[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.360]
The number at night was solo.

[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:00.900]
Mighty low, you know what I mean?

[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:02.820]
Feeling mighty low.

[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.380]
I wonder if peg like baits ever said that.

[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.420]
I got an email about peg like baits.

[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.440]
Which I'll get to eventually in time.

[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.640]
I feel like almost like there's a chance.

[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.440]
Like there's a shot.

[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.640]
Like there's a light.

[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.240]
Now if they ever get that new signal cranked up

[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.040]
and somebody can actually hear the station, then, then.

[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:23.600]
You're listening to Neil Von.

[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.080]
What?

[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.320]
Why the, you wasting?

[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.520]
or government and the first that is religion

[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:11.040]

[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.260]

[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.020]
god just tragic

[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:59.320]
well i hope Jimmy syphilis doesn't get like 90 some percent of the votes on that pull across the street

[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.500]
let me check it out

[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:05.280]

[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.860]
just over and over and over again what kind of a pull is that?

[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:20.380]
oh Jimmy's only got 86.2 percent he dropped a tenth of a point

[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:26.260]
better get on it hop on it and Jimmy sends me a thing about oh well we did this and we did that

[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:30.000]
we're kicking ass and rushed at this yeah big deal big deal you suck

[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:35.900]
you're a broadcaster like my little minpin tiny was a broadcaster Jimmy

[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.440]
and you're play by play abortive and abortion

[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:43.540]
and abortion and of course the fact that it's on this station wow

[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:48.420]
i wonder if the new owner of the doffens is aware of the fact that they're play by play guys

[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.200]
universally reviled

[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:55.680]
and needs to be replaced immediately if not sooner when you say immediately if not sooner

[01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:02.220]
sounds good TR says all this again is about that the giveaway i i don't want to do giveaways

[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:05.680]

do that with that number again okay i'm just telling you i don't like it i don't like it

[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.340]
i don't TR says i had a continuous busy signal i tried maybe 30 times an automatic redog

[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:22.680]
i think what you have is maybe one or two working lines and rollover lines are not

[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:26.180]
operable this is what explain people calling getting a bad number of this is getting a steady busy

[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:31.340]
tone not that qam would ever have technical difficulties he says thanks for the entertainment

[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:35.840]

in other words the fact that he's part of the cause that's a negative not a positive

[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:11.680]
it's kind of like madeline oher i mean granted he had big kahonis and big boobies but um the fact

[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:16.080]
that she was the spokesman for the atheist movement in america uh-was it was really not a positive

[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:25.160]
thing because she was an offensive old bag she was real cut off though i heard or or or or or

[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:31.280]
flick i just saw siblings oh oh i am such an old faggot man make no mistake about boy what's wrong

[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:36.060]
with that at least if you got good taste you know you can google whatever you like it if you like

[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:44.680]
it google away like that genius k j says sorry it took me a week to finally email my congrats on

[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:48.900]
your 33rd anniversary in this town? What an accomplishment. You're amongst the

[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:51.920]
small free of legendary characters who will always be part of our radio history

[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.900]
down here pretty much even Rick Shaw. Oh yeah, I'll always love suds. Rick not so

[01:18:55.900 --> 01:19:01.320]
much. I'm of the Chicago era of Larry Lujak, Uncle Larry and Little Tommy and

[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:05.080]
John Records Landecker. I guess there's still alive too. KJ has a book of

[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:08.880]
Clark Weber's Rock and Roll Radio in 1955 to 1975. Mostly people have never heard

[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:13.060]
of including the aforementioned Clark Weber. A lot from WLS. I cannot say that

[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:20.980]
without hearing the jingle WLS in my head. Some people from five 60 W I

[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:26.360]
and D W C F L. Who the hell is Clark Weber a legendary DJ from Chicago. Love

[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:29.560]
you, honey, wishing you 33 more at least when you die, we all die. Accordingly

[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:36.180]
adoringly, Jeanne and KJ. And that's sweet. It is sweet. Adoringly. When you die,

[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:41.900]
we all die. Well, let me say this. I'm dying over here. Yeah. What's the

[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:44.600]
temperature up to by now? Paulie's probably on the edge of his seat.

[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:51.140]
Congratulations again, Paulie. I never thought I'd say that. 15 already. It's

[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:54.040]
supposed to be a high of 15 and the sun's going to come out this afternoon. They're

[01:19:54.040 --> 01:20:00.140]
saying, although now it's murky, won't that be something almost 60? Almost 60.

[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:05.380]
overnight low though 34. That's not too toasty. And a high tomorrow like 43. Sunday

[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:10.760]
46. Monday 38. Oh geez. Once you get a day when it's like 60, you wanted to stay

[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:15.180]
that way, don't you? Right. And then just increase gradually, you know, and small

[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:22.280]
increments of the 62, 63, 60, you know, like that Theresa. Joe and Carl spring says, thanking

[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:28.280]
me, thanking you for laughing. Let me try it again. I'm having a little problem. What? Take

[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:31.120]
to. Well, I know why you don't read stuff because you're not a good reader. Right. What

[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:34.420]
you tell me that's what I said. So you don't read the emails. You don't read bedtime stories.

[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:38.940]
You just take those great calls. I'm your friend. Don't take any more. Take all the calls

[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:45.240]
you want, but don't talk to him. I don't. Don't talk to him. Don't let him on for a millisecond.

[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:52.180]
I don't. Good. Good job, George. I'm your friend. Joseph, thank you for making me laugh

[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:55.660]
out loud the other day. Pegleg Bates. I haven't heard that name in years. We're about the

[01:20:55.660 --> 01:21:00.020]
same age. Oh, right. Joe. Old ancient. My old man used that name all the time. Look

[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:04.460]
at that guy. He's walking like pegleg Bates. Thanks again. No extra charge. You're welcome,

[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:17.800]
Joe. Pegleg Bates. He was a dark, complex guy in showbiz with a pegleg. Kind of figured

[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:24.040]
it right? Sure. Did he tell you what I read? He says, go ahead. Go ahead. Everybody's saying

[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:29.200]
that yesterday. I heard you mentioned Clark bars. This brought back memories as a kid going

[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:33.660]
to a pirate's game of three were stadium walking past the Clark bar factory. You could smell

[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:37.400]
the chocolate and peanut butter in the air. It was an orgasmic sensation. You know, I

[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:40.700]
had forgotten that there was peanut butter and Clark bars because ordinarily I don't like

[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:45.760]
peanut butter all that much. And especially in candy like Reese's peanut butter. Oh, fat.

[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:52.540]
That. But Clark bars, they must do something special with it. You know? Yeah. The way they

[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:58.100]
whip it all up and yank it together. Now the factory's been turned into a sports bar

[01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:04.120]
between Heinsfield and PNC Park. I bought candy bars online at the Vermont Country Store.

[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:08.320]
They carry many other old candies as well. I belated happy anniversary. Do you have enjoyed

[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:12.100]
your show the past 22 years? Keep up the good work. Go ahead, Jeff and Boiton Beach. Go

[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:18.680]
ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Thanks. Clark bars. Well, I don't want to start getting involved

[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:28.080]
with that. I got to lose some weight. I'm getting a little. Good idea. Chunky. I mean,

[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:38.520]
561 votes on the pool. Now, let's see. Neil, I'm ashamed to admit that this is from

[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:43.960]
a sunny, but I tuned into George Sedanore yesterday. He was ripping Joseph Gackie all day. This

[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:49.460]
turned in him asking the callers who was the best and worst game broadcaster in town. He

[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:53.300]
read the article from the U.M. student newspaper, Joe is my cup of tea, but at least he gets

[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:59.960]
the players right. Jimmy is horrible. Just a bismill says sunny and winning their pool

[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:06.660]
hands down your pants by a mile. Nigel says I agree with that crazy bitch for calling 911

[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:11.000]
three times. What was she supposed to do? Those pigs were just ticked off because they

[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.320]
had to get off their fat asses and do something. Furthermore, those grave robbers at Mickey

[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:17.980]
D should be ashamed of themselves. They couldn't finish her off with their death-inducing

[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:29.660]
food so they stole her money instead. Come on, Nigel. Be nice. Al Vente says. If you don't

[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:33.800]
put you up in the next 10 minutes, I'm switching over to Rush. Now, he's a real man. Love

[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:41.260]
him kisses Al. Yeah. He's a real man. A real pill popping fat phony. Phony, Nazi. All he

[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:49.960]
needs is a paste on mustache and lose about 200 pounds. He'd be a perfect eight-off number

[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:55.080]
two. You see him sweating and screaming and carrying on and just like Hitler and there

[01:23:55.080 --> 01:24:00.700]
are all the Republicans sitting around. Oh, yeah. And a boy, Roger. They're desperate

[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:10.080]
now. They got Paiusha, Paiusha, Jindal and they got Sarah and they got Crazy Rush. That's

[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:15.840]
what they got left. And of course, the whole crew over at IOD was kicking ass. All the right

[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:20.280]
wingers all the time. Doesn't that kind of like scare you a little bit? A little bit? In a market

[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:23.800]
that's supposed to be like a little bit to the left of a till of a hunt and evidently is not

[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:28.920]
maybe just all the Nazis get the diaries. Maybe they stole them. It happens.

[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.720]
564 votes on the pull-witch occupation, though Macho Macho was also a breeding ground for those

[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:43.920]
in the closet. In other words, gay. Lifeguards 131, firefighters 81, football player 75, boy,

[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:51.140]
they spent a lot of time nicking the shower together. Marines 60, cops 42, soldiers 41,

[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:58.780]
paramedics 38, sailors 36, late edition, but it's zoomed on up there. Republicans 30, also late

[01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:03.380]
edition, what did I tell you? Allah, Larry Craig, a lot of toe tapers out there,

[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:09.700]
bouncers 19, they're tapin' it and the toes too. Karate Blackbelts 11 and personal trainers

[01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:14.560]
to where did that come from. Oh, I got an email. Well, I guarantee it's an excellent choice.

[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:27.120]
This dick chained me. I'd like to relax by having Mary Magdalen massage my balls while listening

[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.900]
to the Neil Rogers 12-Hour movie.

[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:06.420]
There's only one way to win the gold. Every swimmer must get stoned. Well,

[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:13.860]
the ston you win the four by 200 meter freestyle relay. The ston you win the 200 meter individual

[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:23.000]
met me. The ston you win the 100 meter butterfly. And the ston you win the four by 100 meter

[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:33.300]
medley relay. There's only one way to win eight goals. Every swimmer must get stoned.

[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:39.000]
Well, that's good news that I was only down 20 points. I think we're in the week on a real

[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.340]
uh, note, sour note. I mean, top noon at QAM. We got the big old coming up in a couple of hours.

[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:48.340]
I can't wait personally. Can you? Neither. That's right. Oh, man.

[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:56.920]
Now, maybe he was responsible for our big January. What do you think? Lighty? I don't think so.

[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:06.040]
I mean, I could be wrong, but that's a real, a real fly opener that three nine in person's 2554,

[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:12.840]
a seven point something in men. When's the last time we had a seven point anything in anything,

[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:18.080]
right? And under the Joe Bell regime, huh? Once upon a time way back in the early part of

[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:23.040]
because I remember him sending me email, all congratulations on the great book. New above me. I like that, you know,

[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:30.920]
till they decided, Oh, we can't let them do that. And until Fidel decided we can't let them hear

[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:36.380]
a five 60. Why couldn't he have put that on like a five 90 or something or like on seven 90 would have

[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:42.040]
been good. 13 cents serious. It's hanging right in there. Maybe it's a real buying opportunity that

[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:48.480]
I was down to least seven and a half point six point eighty five, making a recovery as we speak down seven point seventy two.

[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:56.240]
651,000 jobs lost in February. It's a real buying opportunity. Just ask Maria. She'll give you her diarrhea.

[01:27:56.620 --> 01:28:02.880]
Haven't heard from Maria today with any excuses about the way everything is going to hell in a hand basket.

[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:09.340]
Mark and Miami says, I still listen to Mad Dog, but I have to turn off the radio when the big old comes on. Oh,

[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:16.180]
he is terminal. And I'm sure there are many people who change the radio at two o'clock to seven 90 leave it on for the

[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:21.320]
remainder of the afternoon. Personally, I can't listen to La Bastard. He has to gots impersonating Ed McMahon,

[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:26.880]
laughing at everything he says, even when it isn't remotely funny. I realize he doesn't always talk about sports,

[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:31.620]
but that doesn't make him a good radio personality or is show enjoyable. It says Mark and Miami. Well,

[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:36.700]
that's maybe true, Mark, but he's kicking some ass. He's kicking some big fat bloody ass.

[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:40.480]
That amazing. Yep.

[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:48.360]
Goes to show you. Well, we're slow to learn on this stage. We just, oh, in fact, where's that thing I just had here?

[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:53.020]
Oh, here it is. Mark and Kendall. You'll be just made to hear this.

[01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:59.820]
Well, you won't be this way. You just don't care. Right. Good. That's a good attitude. We don't care.

[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:04.060]
Just, you know what we'd like to have a lot of wired diaries. Now that we're going to that PPM thing,

[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:11.020]
right? You can't wire the PPM. Sure you can. You can sit the meter in front of the radio on one

[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:14.700]
stage, not your favorite station and just leave it there all day. Just walk away. Even though you're not

[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:20.300]
even in the building. Right. But we could use some wired diaries. We could use a real big bogus. I mean,

[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:28.120]
a real big month, like in whatever's going on right now. March. Yeah. March has started now in the

[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:34.060]
train. Well, whatever it is. Get us some money on it. Get us some money. It'll be the last time

[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:38.700]
we ever get any money out of these grave robbers for ratings bonuses. Until, of course, they crank up

[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:44.260]
that signal. That's going to happen sometime this year. That's the rumor. The century. They're cranking

[01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:47.700]
it up. They're getting a big power boost and they're going to crank it up. They're going to pee on the

[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:53.040]
tower. You just wait and see every day. They're going to send Gary Sarner out there to pee on the

[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:57.940]
tower since he ain't inside the building anymore. He'll always be part of QAM. It's in his blood.

[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:02.880]
In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing a whole bunch of his blood up and down the hallway before he finally

[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:08.980]
goes for the last time. Wouldn't that be great? Sure. There will be blood and it will be Gary Sarner's

[01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:12.880]
little be kosher. You can guarantee you that. There won't be nothing. Trayff in his blood.

[01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:17.500]
Mark and Kendall says I turned your station on last night around nine expecting to hear DA.

[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:23.320]
Even though his rating suck, he has a pretty good show. To my dismay, it was Kim Bo camper and some

[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:28.540]
sports writer conducting interview with a high school kid. Oh, Jesus. The speed at which I turn

[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:32.840]
off would rival the time it takes you to hit the door at woodbine. They need to change the station's

[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:39.460]
call sign to WQA seven. Now, can you explain that to me? What does that mean? No, I can't explain it to

[01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:51.080]
you. WQA seven. A mistake? You think Mark made a typo on there? Maybe. What does that mean, Mark?

[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:57.620]
Is that how many listeners we're going to have left? Lots of Kim Bo camper, man. Lots of stuff that

[01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:04.440]
people don't want to hear. Wouldn't Kimba wouldn't it be nice if he was not again? Wouldn't that be good?

[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:11.240]
They're obsessed with him just like when when Charlie Joe put his boyfriend, Kenny Walker on with

[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:20.440]
Kim Bo on that Kenny and blow morning show. Oh my god. Remember those days? Yep. I'll never forget.

[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:28.220]
Or not gay. The square table. I mean, that show was just that show gives the word blows new meaning.

[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:34.540]
I mean, just it's just blue. Even cat blue. I'd never seen nothing like that. Rick says,

[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:38.700]
planning a trip to Toronto this fall. I'm wondering what your opinion is on visiting the hockey hall of

[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:45.060]
fame. Well, if you got little kids, little kids, not teenagers, but like little kids, they might

[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:51.920]
enjoy it. I've been there once. Disappointing. That's and I'm a huge hockey fan, make no mistake

[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:58.260]
about that, but it was disappointing to me. It was like for kids, you know, George will be going

[01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:02.240]
there. Oh yeah. Go to the sea and tower and jump. That's going to be a great place to jump from.

[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:08.460]
You betcha. I'm a little nervous even about I've never been to it. And I'm nervous about

[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:12.660]
taking that elevator that goes all the way to the top, you know, or close to the top. And at night

[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:16.200]
time, they light it up all these different colors like fluorescent, you know, it's really neat.

[01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:21.680]
And you can see that elevator going up on the side of the tower and it's like a bug like a

[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:31.180]
jaguette, a kukaracha. And kids, my drift. Are you drifted? The fake Tom Jika has a long, long

[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:38.820]
email here sent yesterday afternoon right toward the end of the show. He says, I watched the first

[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:43.540]
Jimmy Fallon show on Monday night, not good. I'm kind of rooting for the guy to succeed, but

[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:48.420]
truth be told, I never found him to be exceedingly funny on SNL. I don't think he's going to have

[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:55.380]
the likeability factor to win over large audiences in late night TV. Says Tommy, fake Tommy.

[01:32:56.340 --> 01:33:00.180]
I found the first show to be pretty painful for the entire hour. I won't judge him on the first

[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:03.820]
show though because I remember what Dan's first show sounded like. And that was truly painful,

[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:11.440]
really, really painful. Dan, who? I don't know. Dan? Dan, Dan the monkey man. I don't know.

[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:16.020]
Fallon's opening monologue was okay at best. The slow jam, the news, I thought was extremely

[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:20.140]
painful. It was probably a funny idea on paper, but it didn't seem to come across that funny.

[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:24.480]
And why is the roots the house band? Aren't they a little better than to be the house band on

[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:31.060]
a late late show? The roots. Are they akin to the grassroots? No, no relation. Oh, who's the roots?

[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:38.880]
Abandoned. You know? Yeah. Oh, personally, you know, I thought the show got really painful

[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:43.160]
after that little time. He says the Robert De Niro appearance was embarrassing. He didn't want to be

[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:49.040]
there. He was obviously doing a favor to someone at NBC by green to do it. He obviously wanted to

[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:54.240]
promote his Tribeca film festival, but he didn't even do that well. The skit with Fallon and

[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:59.660]
De Niro was just dreadful. Then Justin Tinkerbell came out and tried his best to save the show. But by

[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:05.180]
that time, I think it was already over. Tinkerbell is funny and talented. Oh, I'm thinking a Tinkerbell

[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:09.720]
show would be way more entertained than a Jimmy Fallon show. And why exactly was Van Morrison there?

[01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:14.720]
That made as much sense as us doing sports flashes every half hour. Now, I want to read that to you

[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:21.500]
again. That last sentence. Okay. That made as much sense as us doing sports flashes every half hour.

[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:33.500]
We have sports flashes. You're not following it. This is the fake Tom Jekker saying that made as much

[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:40.520]
sense as us doing sports flashes every half hour. Yeah. I didn't get the first time. I'm sorry. Give away.

[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:46.780]
Sorry. Yeah. Give away. Cross the street. I hope the show gets better, meaning Jimmy Fallon. I'm

[01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:50.700]
not a huge late night TV fan, but I have sent the T-Vote record a few more episodes of Jimmy Fallon.

[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:54.820]
I'm excited to see him with Tina Fagan when she comes on. By the time you read this blog,

[01:34:55.240 --> 01:35:03.300]
they probably already will have been on this blog. This is a blog. I don't want to sound old here,

[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:08.860]
but late night TV was at its best with Johnny Carson. Well, guess what? Not even close. That dude could

[01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:13.720]
do a late night talk show like no other. Wrong. Steve Allen, Jack Parr, they were the kings of late night

[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:18.300]
TV. Johnny Carson was weak. He was like the rascal house of late night TV.

[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:23.680]
Yeah. I find it sad. He never agreed to allow his old shows to be rebroadcast and syndication

[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:28.000]
or released on DVD. An entire audience of young people will never know the pleasure of watching

[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:35.120]
Johnny Carson before bed. Thank God. Here's Johnny. I feel like I can safely say Jimmy Fallon will never

[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:39.840]
be the Carson Letterman League, but it wasn't as bad as the Chevy T-Show or the Magic Johnson Show.

[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:43.820]
Anyone remember a thick of the night with Alan Thick? That was supposed to be the next big thing

[01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:50.760]
when I was a kid. It says, Sign the Fake Time Jikker. That made as much sense as us doing sports

[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:59.480]
flashes every half hour. Us, us, us. Got it? Got it. That sounds like a simple typewriter to me,

[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:07.140]
little Tommy. Yeah. Yeah. Not good. Some of these fake people, the Dow is up eight and a half

[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:10.140]
points. All right, man. It's going to be a great Friday. You'll see.

[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:16.260]
Here's one from Rebecca. Are you going to do it another appearance in Miami? I didn't do an

[01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:20.500]
appearance in Miami. I did one in Halendil. We moved to North Carolina like all your other

[01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:25.060]
listeners in George. I'm looking for an excuse to come to Miami. I missed the Cuban food.

[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:33.200]
Says Rebecca. Yeah. I'll be around. Cliff and Kendall says the bus to Taco Hill.

[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:37.440]
Oh, this is that story about the beheading guy. Do we really care about that?

[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:41.680]
I'm not sure. I'm confused. It's stabbing beheading and cannibalizing another man.

[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:45.080]
A Canadian judge ruled yesterday the man accused of beheading and cannibalizing a fellow

[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:50.080]
ground bus passenger is not criminally responsible due to mental illness and an addiction to Taco Bell.

[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:54.360]
Oh, yeah. I want to chop somebody's head off right now and I haven't been to Taco Bell in months.

[01:36:56.340 --> 01:37:00.940]
Lee killed a 22 year old carnival worker was never in question at the trial. Lee is admitted he

[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:05.400]
killed McClean but pleaded not guilty. Witnesses said Lee attacked McClean unprovoked

[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:09.360]
as their bus traveled at night along a desolate stretch of the trans-Canadian highway.

[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:13.680]
And a greed statement of facts between the prosecution and defense detailed how

[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:18.720]
passengers stood outside the bus as Lee stabbed McClean dozens of times and beheaded and mutilated

[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:24.180]
his body. Finding himself locked inside the bus he finally escaped your window was arrested.

[01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:29.560]
Leave that apologized and pleaded with police to kill him. Police said McClean's body parts were

[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:34.160]
found throughout the bus and plastic bags and the victims ear and nose and tongue were found in

[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:40.220]
Lee's pocket along with the Taco Bell Chalupa and three packs of hot sauce and three.

[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:48.000]
Three packs of hot sauce. Don't choke. The Chinese immigrant complained that he ate all McClean

[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.540]
he could but he was still hungry an hour later. All right. Funny. Taco Bell would not return

[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:57.940]
repeated requests for a comment. Cliff and Kendall sent that. Yeah, we had the

[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:05.120]
hundred of those. It's old news. You got to really do something nasty here to be a criminal

[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:11.520]
in Canada. That's just behead some guy and chew them up like that. Crazy Chinese man.

[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:13.920]
Oh, Neil! You're listening to Neil Rogers.

[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:15.400]
Neil God.

[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.400]
I'm a man.

[01:38:18.450 --> 01:38:24.070]
Tight little island full of gay romance. They wear gay sandals and they wear tight pants.

[01:38:24.530 --> 01:38:31.210]
Sundance after bottom every day. Blessed with the miracle of being gay. The very best of

[01:38:31.210 --> 01:38:38.310]
packets in the USA. Giving big, big pleasure in a big, big way. The very best of packets in the USA.

[01:38:39.050 --> 01:38:41.790]
Giving big, big pleasure in a big, big way.

[01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:49.730]
Just a feeling. Join the big wish to Chesterfield Queen. You choice of the fags of America.

[01:38:50.010 --> 01:38:54.770]
Club 17 at 560 WQM. So I guess yesterday we never did decide who had the manly or penis

[01:38:54.770 --> 01:38:58.890]
Don or Phil Everly. We never got any input on that. No, no, no one responded. No.

[01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:05.130]
Kevin says, sorry, we're late with this. I've been listening from somewhere in the 1979

[01:39:05.130 --> 01:39:09.850]
80 time frame. He's still on me hours of sleep lost when you and Bill Carter used to do cross-overs

[01:39:09.850 --> 01:39:13.450]
at midnight and sometimes lasted until three or four in the morning. After callers,

[01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:19.330]
see what the field George says Kevin. Okay. Well, here you go. Thanks Kevin. Sounds like a

[01:39:19.330 --> 01:39:22.950]
guy to say we were having fun. That's why he used to stay on until two, three sometimes four in the

[01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:29.790]
morning with Carter. We just laugh our asses off for free. You know, wow. It was a work of love.

[01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:34.930]
The labor of love. The labor of love. Another shot at love.

[01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:39.750]
Mark and Candlest is I heard you see this is the guy that gave us the WQA 7.

[01:39:41.610 --> 01:39:45.450]
Here's the explanation which is going to leave you lame and limp. Okay.

[01:39:46.050 --> 01:39:51.090]
I heard you say the other day WQM stood for a quid at midnight WQA 7. Get it?

[01:39:53.330 --> 01:40:01.150]
We quit at seven. How about we quit a long time ago? Okay, thanks Mark. Good luck to you.

[01:40:01.150 --> 01:40:05.390]
We quit at seven. That's that's a shot. That's a real shot at Kimba Volkamp,

[01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:08.650]
or Ann. Well deserved by the way too. That Kimba and Blow Morning Show.

[01:40:09.390 --> 01:40:13.390]
People have been executed for lesser crimes than that. That was up 16 point. It's just kind of

[01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:20.930]
hovering before the big blow. Neil at neorodges.com. That's our email address. Kind of slowed down now.

[01:40:21.690 --> 01:40:26.170]
I would have felt we got in a tremendous response after especially after those monthlys. My god.

[01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:29.170]
Let me see those again. I want to honestly for real.

[01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:36.890]
For real. Is real. I want to see the in my in somebody's a pretty and that's clear.

[01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:42.190]
It's numbers. See how it makes numbers like a child. Like a like a baby.

[01:40:43.810 --> 01:40:54.910]
Many teen plus in January QAM 4.3. Waxi 1.9. God they suck. They blow.

[01:40:56.530 --> 01:41:04.090]
Except in the afternoon they stop blowing. I say not amazing. That love a turd man. He's just

[01:41:04.770 --> 01:41:12.970]
out of control. And let's see. Person's 2554. In the morning we got a 1.0. In the afternoon we got

[01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:24.730]
0.7. 0.7. And we got a 3.9. How do you like that? I like it. And when you were scrappling a man,

[01:41:24.770 --> 01:41:32.090]
especially when you make it 10 to that's 10 to 3. That's 10 to 3 baby 3.9 7.8. That means we got

[01:41:32.090 --> 01:41:41.030]
an 8 something in man 2554 8 8 8. We got 8. And sometimes getting 8 and all that bad. Depends

[01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:48.590]
on who's doing the 8. And nevertheless got some very sad news, especially for our sales department.

[01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:54.910]
A private connected based broadcasting school with campuses more than a dozen states abruptly shut

[01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:59.310]
down this week and said yesterday they'll seek bankruptcy protection. Oh my God.

[01:41:59.930 --> 01:42:03.390]
The Connecticut School of Broadcasting blame its financial woes on a tightening of the

[01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:10.230]
private student loan market tuition for 16 week courses as much as 12 grand. The school has several

[01:42:10.230 --> 01:42:16.890]
Florida locations including one at 3901 Coconut Palm Drive in Tampa. I'm extremely disappointed

[01:42:16.890 --> 01:42:21.350]
that after 44 years of operation, CSB will not be able to fulfill its mission of providing

[01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:25.650]
quality education to students interested in working in the broadcast industry. School President

[01:42:25.650 --> 01:42:31.050]
David Banner said I'm also disappointed that the actions of our lender precipitated the

[01:42:31.050 --> 01:42:35.410]
sudden disruption into lives and careers of our students and employees. The school's got 26

[01:42:35.410 --> 01:42:42.270]
locations in 16 states. The school said it was surprised that its lender Pittsburgh based PNC

[01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:47.150]
financial seized control of the school's accounts and then froze them as it was attempting to find

[01:42:47.150 --> 01:42:52.090]
other ways to fund the business. I guess you won't be hearing any more of those spots for the

[01:42:52.090 --> 01:42:57.870]
squeaky voice broadcasters. Oh well. In a statement, the school said it would promptly seek protection

[01:42:57.870 --> 01:43:04.350]
under applicable insolvency laws. In other words, were off-sourced or maybe off-sulophous?

[01:43:05.970 --> 01:43:11.610]
PNC spokesman Fred Solomon speaking of off-sulophous said the company does not discuss its

[01:43:11.610 --> 01:43:17.070]
customers their accounts because of bank confidentiality rules. PNC recently acquired Cleveland's

[01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:21.210]
troubled national city court and last week slashed its quarterly dividend by 85 percent.

[01:43:21.710 --> 01:43:26.370]
Its stock was down more than 12 percent Thursday trading under its 52-week low of $20.33.

[01:43:28.670 --> 01:43:33.050]
At the school's Farmington locations students say they found out by text message Wednesday night

[01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:36.990]
while others showed up for class and found the doors locked. How do you like that? You go to class

[01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:40.550]
and the doors are locked. Have we like showing up at work and the doors are locked?

[01:43:43.230 --> 01:43:48.410]
Wow. Tracy Miller, a January graduate, said she was upset about losing the lifetime job

[01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:52.250]
placement help and studio privileges that the school agreed to in a contract she signed.

[01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:57.410]
She also was angry because radio demos she recorded for potential employers

[01:43:57.410 --> 01:44:02.070]
were on computers inside the locked school. I just want some answers. I'm in the dark right now

[01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:09.410]
said Miller 22 of Plainville. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said yesterday his

[01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:13.790]
office was looking into the closure including whether school officials kept taking money from students

[01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:18.190]
when they knew it would be shut down. Well that's a good scam, huh? I'm not saying they did it but

[01:44:18.190 --> 01:44:23.810]
wouldn't that be a great scam? It would be. The office will seek tuition refunds for students if

[01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:28.810]
finds any violations of law. Blumenthal said the State Department of Higher Education was also

[01:44:28.810 --> 01:44:33.950]
seeking refunds and options for students to complete their studies. The school was founded in

[01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:41.210]
Farmington in 1964 by a Hartford broadcaster Dick Robinson. Remember him? Yep. Robinson and his

[01:44:41.210 --> 01:44:47.430]
family will reopen the broadcast school under a different name at that location. Oh they want to

[01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:52.190]
reopen well maybe and maybe not. They want to reopen it under a different name. Family said in

[01:44:52.190 --> 01:44:56.110]
the letter posted that the school they plan to apply for a state license to teach media and

[01:44:56.110 --> 01:45:00.130]
communications. It'll be contacting students to help them complete their studies at no additional

[01:45:00.130 --> 01:45:04.090]
cost. I don't know why because the business is over with anyway. There ain't no more broadcast

[01:45:04.090 --> 01:45:10.390]
business. It's done. It's finished except for us in January. Boy we got a kiss. We finally got a

[01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:16.330]
big kiss. That's what we needed. A kiss as in Kushner and Tuckers Jimmy Cifalus.

[01:45:19.290 --> 01:45:26.470]
I'm just pumped about that. I'm pleased this punch. We finally got the moment. I'll say we

[01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:31.850]
do work for this regime and you need all the breaks you can get. That old expression break a leg.

[01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:36.630]
Oh never were true words spoken and working for this crowd. Oh you don't know what you're talking

[01:45:36.630 --> 01:45:44.690]
about Neil. We're really promoting and yeah we're really out there go getting. That was up six

[01:45:44.690 --> 01:45:53.250]
points just a little under six but who's who's counting right one two I think they ought to have

[01:45:53.250 --> 01:45:59.530]
a special month on the gambling channel on CNBC and make all those people including the ones

[01:45:59.530 --> 01:46:06.350]
who no longer work there like Ted David all them come on and apologize and they could do a

[01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:10.570]
telephone and try to raise the money to pay back all these poor suckers out there who got stuck

[01:46:10.570 --> 01:46:17.050]
under their hype hype not investment advice hype oh it's a buying opportunity

[01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:26.710]
yeah buy this 1225 a QM we have another great restaurant deal coming up next week on

[01:46:56.710 --> 01:46:59.910]
hello

[01:47:47.230 --> 01:47:50.870]
the audience is offended by Jimmy Cipyllis's performance on those

[01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:54.610]
but is that in where he says apricot or who says apricot somebody

[01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:59.050]
oh oh oh oh right

[01:50:00.850 --> 01:50:06.230]
run away bride this apricot strawberry blueberry apricot no no no no no

[01:50:06.230 --> 01:50:06.510]
I'm wrong

[01:50:11.190 --> 01:50:17.470]
apricot hey how the hell are you apricot what is it nothing and it's definitely not

[01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:23.950]
in that bit I don't know why I keep thinking it is but I'm thinking it's Jack

[01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:28.830]
Nicholson saying apricot but it's not oh the beast followed up with the qa7 he

[01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:40.170]

[01:50:40.170 --> 01:50:45.910]
the beast he's with us whether we like it or not he's with us he's there always

[01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:49.930]
there he's like part of the like what's his name part of the woodwork

[01:50:49.930 --> 01:50:54.110]
jury sarner he may not be in the building in body but in spirit he's still in

[01:50:54.110 --> 01:50:58.890]
there he's ingrained in the walls just like the water Nazi there is no water

[01:50:58.890 --> 01:51:05.430]
Nazi yeah what a bitch he was I tell you one thing you know when you look at the

somebody with no numbers says all what ratings don't mean anything those are

[01:53:06.650 --> 01:53:10.530]
the people have no ratings trying to rationalize the fact that they also have

[01:53:10.530 --> 01:53:15.670]
no talent no audience that they are reviled and despised by the overwhelming

[01:53:15.670 --> 01:53:23.430]

You might you might actually hear. Yeah, bad

[01:58:15.490 --> 01:58:17.510]
1245 at 560 WQ I am

[01:58:18.930 --> 01:58:20.790]
Frank says about rush

[01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:23.870]
He was arguing about bailing out the homeowners going into foreclosure

[01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:27.710]
His argument was that the homeowners were not swindled and that they knew that in five years

[01:58:27.710 --> 01:58:30.610]
They wouldn't be able to afford and they should accept their foreclosure and that's it

[01:58:30.610 --> 01:58:32.670]
It's all their fault no fault of the banks and brokers

[01:58:33.550 --> 01:58:39.070]
What he fails to mention is he always does when he spins things is that these homeowners were promised a no lose deal

[01:58:39.530 --> 01:58:43.770]
They were promised in the event that the arm comes due they would have two options

[01:58:43.770 --> 01:58:46.770]
They could refinance at a lower rate or worse could just sell their house

[01:58:47.630 --> 01:58:52.690]
Of course thrown into the sell the house pitches that house prices are tripling and a five years your house

[01:58:52.690 --> 01:58:58.570]
Will triple and price and you'll make a huge profit because everybody knows house prices never decline to the always increasing demand

[01:58:58.570 --> 01:59:00.610]
They always and they always reduce the supply

[01:59:01.570 --> 01:59:07.450]
Fact is no one mentioned the fact that the increase in housing prices was significantly higher than the increase of the wages of the home buyers

[01:59:07.450 --> 01:59:09.970]
Demand the government can throughout the increasing average wage

[01:59:09.970 --> 01:59:14.070]
But they don't mention that if one guy gets a billion dollar raise and 50 others get nothing

[01:59:14.490 --> 01:59:20.730]
It's still looks like a growing economy in short Russia's full of Schmidt a man to that Frank Russia's full of Schmidt

[01:59:20.730 --> 01:59:21.410]
you

[01:59:22.690 --> 01:59:29.010]

[01:59:42.650 --> 01:59:43.810]
They're a homos

[01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:46.070]
Love Larry

[01:59:46.690 --> 01:59:47.610]

[01:59:54.190 --> 01:59:56.070]
Sure, he's talking about homos

[01:59:56.070 --> 01:59:57.730]
Larry you fair rhymes

[01:59:58.350 --> 02:00:02.990]
No, I know thanks thanks Larry, but no thanks. I don't go to dinner with strangers. Do you?

[02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:10.250]
No, I don't depend on what they look like I reckon now that's true. I'm sure that Larry don't look like somebody I would want to go to dinner with

[02:00:12.270 --> 02:00:16.110]
I know what a lunch dinner breakfast late night snacks with strangers

[02:00:17.290 --> 02:00:18.930]
We just anonymous people out there

[02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:27.830]
And this one he's selling the slap chop

[02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:36.010]
The what it's got a link forward to about 36 seconds. You'll see that he thinks highly of his nuts

[02:00:36.010 --> 02:00:42.810]
Well, that's good. I'm glad he likes his nuts. I don't he's ugliest sin. He's bizarre. I don't think he's of the human species

[02:00:44.670 --> 02:00:47.830]

[02:01:08.150 --> 02:01:14.710]
I have little or no sympathy for women who stay in bad relationships where they're abused and beaten and battered

[02:01:14.710 --> 02:01:17.670]
I just oh, I'm in love another shot in love well

That's gonna be 15 sun is out there. I think it would be I wouldn't be surprised if it gets up to 100 degrees today

[02:04:53.530 --> 02:04:53.870]
Wow

[02:04:54.590 --> 02:04:58.250]
This is the kind of this is the kind of day you know to go where would bind

[02:04:58.970 --> 02:04:59.570]
Good thought

[02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:02.250]
Something to think about you could go for walk

[02:05:03.070 --> 02:05:06.070]
Go for walk where around the block burn some of that fat

[02:05:07.170 --> 02:05:10.110]
I do a lot of walking in wood by mr. Let me tell you right now good

[02:05:10.890 --> 02:05:13.470]
Now I noticed a steve stone did not send me the um

[02:05:14.210 --> 02:05:17.250]
Pages for the first race of Gulf Stream. I'm not gonna get suckered into that again

[02:05:18.070 --> 02:05:21.570]
We then it's not part of our promotion. I'm not gonna start handy crapping two races

[02:05:21.570 --> 02:05:23.830]
They I got enough pressure with one you know

[02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:25.750]
with one race

[02:05:27.250 --> 02:05:32.290]
And for cliff he's got a $50 win bet on the six horse burning blaze in the second race with

[02:05:32.290 --> 02:05:37.030]
Who's riding a bar koa who used to be i bar koa and now he's a bar koa

[02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:39.150]
You ever see a bar?

[02:05:40.230 --> 02:05:40.630]
No

[02:05:40.630 --> 02:05:43.950]
You see a bar good one jump right in

[02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:47.730]
So I'm gonna leave that on there. I don't know what I'm gonna do

[02:05:49.010 --> 02:05:51.310]
Because we sure ain't got no more emails. I'll tell you that

[02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:54.250]
Well, I got one here from Gregory Belmore about radio

[02:05:55.150 --> 02:05:55.590]
Oh

[02:05:56.150 --> 02:05:59.750]
It goes on forever. We'll take us up till midnight if I read it

[02:05:59.750 --> 02:06:01.210]
But even I don't have the

[02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:05.090]
The balls to do that 22 minutes till the first race of Gulf Stream

[02:06:06.050 --> 02:06:08.650]
And our race is it by 144

[02:06:10.970 --> 02:06:12.450]
Getting excited a little bit

[02:06:13.130 --> 02:06:18.690]
Little no not much not like when you're out there though. Oh god and actually betting on it. No then you're involved

[02:06:18.690 --> 02:06:18.690]

[02:06:20.630 --> 02:06:25.790]
God Georgia winner last last we got him the double for $9.60 cents $5 double

[02:06:27.390 --> 02:06:28.770]
I'll see 960

[02:06:30.650 --> 02:06:32.010]
1920 and 480

[02:06:32.530 --> 02:06:37.490]
24 bucks you got and you bet 21 so you made three dollars. I was all excited about it

[02:06:37.490 --> 02:06:41.250]
Well, there you go and you got the 40 bucks from surely too. That's right

[02:06:41.250 --> 02:06:46.810]
And next time Georgia's out there. Let's have a whole bunch of people bring them 40 bucks big back 20 bucks or 10 bucks just some big bags

[02:06:48.170 --> 02:06:49.050]
That would be great

[02:06:50.190 --> 02:06:53.770]
I know if I did it in appearance somewhere and somebody who came by and brought me a 40 dollar

[02:06:55.850 --> 02:06:57.810]
Something I'd be pretty happy about it. I was

[02:07:00.130 --> 02:07:02.450]
That's surely for you. I still don't understand what that was all about

[02:07:02.450 --> 02:07:05.430]
I guess you made it bet for you the previous time and she never got the cash right

[02:07:06.250 --> 02:07:09.090]
Said it that's that's the story and she's sticking to it

[02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:13.450]
I'm gonna go out and get some apricot seeds

[02:07:14.490 --> 02:07:16.430]
Who put the eighth in apricot

[02:07:17.690 --> 02:07:24.590]
Do you know anybody who says apricot? No, I don't I don't even just jack Nicholson and boy that movie sure sucked the shining

[02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:28.850]
Red rum red rum red rum

[02:07:33.330 --> 02:07:37.130]
I'm looking for something. What are you looking for something from the shine red

[02:07:37.130 --> 02:07:41.250]
I don't think I have anything looking for what no I have shining star by the manhattans, but that's it

[02:07:41.730 --> 02:07:44.890]
What were you looking for like the theme music or something from it? But I don't

[02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:48.310]
From what the shining all from the shining

[02:07:49.210 --> 02:07:52.310]
There's a theme song from the shining. Oh, they got some music or something on it

[02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:56.610]
I'm thinking about dining not the shining

[02:07:57.350 --> 02:08:02.670]
Dining and dancing. I'm wondering about lunch. That's right. Joey Carse. He did it alive. Joey Car ladies and gentlemen

[02:08:03.390 --> 02:08:07.990]
Everybody wants to know those horrible spots dining and dancing and

[02:08:09.790 --> 02:08:11.650]
Wow, what a schmendrick he was

[02:08:12.410 --> 02:08:16.810]
I said it was maybe you still around Joey Car dead or alive

[02:08:16.810 --> 02:08:22.130]
Neil Rogers well here with the water to do our

[02:08:22.130 --> 02:08:30.870]
Are you angry that they got up take my favorite peanut blood up?

[02:08:30.910 --> 02:08:33.510]
They said it could hurt my belly

[02:08:34.130 --> 02:08:40.050]
Now my teamy jay has nothing but the jelly boy. They really try to scare you

[02:08:40.050 --> 02:08:42.650]
And renew it from the area

[02:08:43.250 --> 02:08:44.190]
It is really

[02:08:44.190 --> 02:08:48.810]
That they didn't band this on a peanut product

[02:08:49.730 --> 02:08:56.190]
They took away my peanut butter my favorite brand unlike the one of all

[02:08:56.190 --> 02:09:01.730]
Because they said we should be where this whole thing really isn't fair

[02:09:02.750 --> 02:09:05.610]
Wait a minute. I found another

[02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:07.550]
Carifies my friends

[02:09:14.670 --> 02:09:18.130]
How about some vanilla salmonella sounds good to me sounds delicious

[02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:20.990]
No sound delicious. It's all my vanilla

[02:09:23.730 --> 02:09:28.150]
Fé 101 at 560 WQ I am golfing first race coming up from 15 minutes

[02:09:28.650 --> 02:09:34.970]
Are we going to pay any attention to that or what will kill some time right because the emails have stopped and nobody knows anything about Joey Car

[02:09:36.810 --> 02:09:42.350]
Hmm of South Florida TV fame. I mean nobody has anything to say good bad dead in different

[02:09:43.570 --> 02:09:46.830]
I was his brother's name Steve Feldman or something Steve

[02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:49.350]
Race TV huh race

[02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:57.550]
You sure don't know your South Florida TV history. Oh, you know is Wayne Chandler and we you don't even know Wayne Chandler

[02:09:57.550 --> 02:09:59.950]
Oh, yeah, you do wait for us to say I don't know yeah

[02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:07.310]
And skip the people important people and the guy that did the the um midnight movies or whatever that was

[02:10:07.310 --> 02:10:10.230]
The creature features empty graves

[02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:16.910]
Yeah, I remember him I remember big Wilson they've dicks and dead dicks of all of the Wilson

[02:10:17.530 --> 02:10:19.130]
Big Wilson fat and dead

[02:10:20.430 --> 02:10:22.470]
They've game fat and still alive I think

[02:10:23.150 --> 02:10:28.510]
Nobody knows from Joey Car I even googled it go Joey Car Miami TV whatever nothing he just vanished

[02:10:29.090 --> 02:10:33.710]
Maybe too much dining and dancing maybe boy he was

[02:10:35.470 --> 02:10:36.710]
He was unbelievable

[02:10:37.170 --> 02:10:42.690]
Jay and Miami says 12 grand for 16 weeks only to graduate and become a board off making 20 grand or less

[02:10:42.690 --> 02:10:46.790]
Is that where flea got his degree? No, it is not where flea got his degree

[02:10:47.690 --> 02:10:51.730]
Well, what is this about a degree you get a degree in broadcasting? Yeah, the third degree

[02:10:51.730 --> 02:10:54.970]
Yeah, that's right. That's what this guy's given us the third degree Jay

[02:10:55.850 --> 02:10:59.550]
Making fun of the Connecticut School of Broadcasting all the money they spend on this station

[02:11:00.230 --> 02:11:04.690]
All the squeaky voice kids. Oh, we're gonna make you a broadcaster and a lot of cases it worked

[02:11:09.650 --> 02:11:13.190]
Jimmy Torsky is getting really a pseudonym intellectual on us here today. Wow

[02:11:14.190 --> 02:11:16.550]
Holy cow, he's got a long good thing he does

[02:11:17.330 --> 02:11:19.330]
Because his is the only one right now

[02:11:21.290 --> 02:11:24.210]
All of our radio people they've abandoned us altogether today

[02:11:25.650 --> 02:11:29.350]
They're disappointed that we're not gonna have the great debate you know the contrabid

[02:11:32.770 --> 02:11:37.910]
Have you ever heard anything so never never sad I'm challenging

[02:11:37.910 --> 02:11:40.930]
You would wait grasping for what I mean

[02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:47.770]
What's the point for attention pay attention to us talk to oh my god? Although you're doing a good job reading all their emails

[02:11:48.790 --> 02:11:51.130]
Whose theirs? Well who cares?

[02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:53.210]
Who cares?

[02:11:53.210 --> 02:11:56.670]
It kills some time and look at the great trend we had in January and you

[02:11:56.670 --> 02:12:02.390]
You come on the other day and say that the format blows you hated it. It's a torture. All right

[02:12:03.550 --> 02:12:08.650]
That's what you said that's yeah, I said it was said you missed those great calls. I'm your friend you missed that

[02:12:08.650 --> 02:12:09.470]
Hi, Ron

[02:12:11.330 --> 02:12:17.090]
And I miss Gilbertsky says although I believe the predatory lenders played a major role in our current economic situation

[02:12:17.810 --> 02:12:20.250]
Situations I'm also sick of homeowners getting zero blame

[02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:25.230]
We're such a nation of victims aren't we my best friend who never held the same job for more than a year

[02:12:25.230 --> 02:12:30.510]
Made the decision to buy a house for over 400 grand now. He's completely screwed as he learned from his mistakes

[02:12:30.510 --> 02:12:36.410]
Of course not while having no current job in a baby to now support he recently called me for advice and buying a giant TV

[02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:43.750]
I think personal responsibilities dead in this country and unless we start taking some all the stimulus and bailouts in the world won't save

[02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:46.310]
The sinking ship boy Jimmy is so depressing, you know

[02:12:47.090 --> 02:12:48.370]
He's really uplifting guy

[02:12:49.070 --> 02:12:54.550]
By the way, stay far away from the console look at the hard rock great stakes, but awful overpriced sides

[02:12:54.550 --> 02:12:59.010]
And I had to pull over on a way to get home so my wife could throw up I threw up not long after

[02:12:59.850 --> 02:13:04.590]
If you insist on eating at the casino tried the food court deli the giant turkey club is unethane believable

[02:13:04.590 --> 02:13:06.390]
Yeah, I have tried the food court deli

[02:13:07.190 --> 02:13:09.370]
I like their hot food Sunday mmm

[02:13:10.230 --> 02:13:11.310]
Not the deli thing

[02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:16.470]
Whatever the joint ice cream joint the food court get and closing next time reanna gets

[02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:21.130]
Punchy deserves it to quote Bill Mar women came complain about men when they start showing better taste in them

[02:13:22.150 --> 02:13:26.530]
Well, that's a good line Bill Mar came up with that. How do you like that? The tour people is nobody else

[02:13:26.530 --> 02:13:31.430]
Women came complain about men when they start showing better taste in them have a great weekend. Well you too Jimmy D

[02:13:31.990 --> 02:13:34.790]
Bye-bye Jimmy D. Bye-bye Jimmy D

[02:13:36.410 --> 02:13:38.550]
I bet you there's still nothing on there about Joey Carr

[02:13:40.090 --> 02:13:42.750]
And Steve Solomon or whatever his brother's name was

[02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:48.330]
Reason his brother's name was a real Jewish name is because his brother didn't change his name like Joey Carr

[02:13:50.290 --> 02:13:52.630]
Like Robinowitz or whatever his real name was nothing

[02:13:53.310 --> 02:13:56.790]
Zip but he do does it. I think it's because it's the erasing hour

[02:13:56.790 --> 02:13:59.850]
Do you mention the jockey changed the hubby at Castellano?

[02:14:00.050 --> 02:14:02.250]
Julian Lepp Rue under the weather not riding today

[02:14:02.250 --> 02:14:06.410]
So uh, this is a son of Gone West and what about your horse in here?

[02:14:06.530 --> 02:14:09.390]
Rollie who you like the raising tors was that it was that's correct

[02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:16.910]
I like the way Jimmy Toners prepared this horse to start spring. Aren't you excited about Defoe showing up on 9.40 in the morning? Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow

[02:14:18.130 --> 02:14:20.250]
Yeah, you must be able to see my nipples

[02:14:24.330 --> 02:14:26.850]
Here's one about Sid the Iid but nothing about Joey Carr

[02:14:29.630 --> 02:14:32.150]
Different you well, I'll print it out

[02:14:33.690 --> 02:14:36.750]
Nine minutes till post-art for the first race at the Gulf Stream

[02:14:39.630 --> 02:14:43.550]
What's that the handicap is named Ron Nicoletti? That's one of the guys that we just done there

[02:14:43.550 --> 02:14:45.950]
With the real New York. He sounds speaking of Sid

[02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:55.390]
On the track for race one with exacta trifecta superfecta next one. Why does he say one? I don't know why he says it

[02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:57.970]
Oh, this is from Hawk Mark the fake Hawk Mark

[02:14:59.930 --> 02:15:05.170]
I have been told exact words to my face ratings don't matter because I'm the most pound-toward person in this market

[02:15:05.170 --> 02:15:10.570]
The fact is the promotions here at 790 are completely focused on the Dan La Bastard show and to a lesser degree Sid show

[02:15:11.290 --> 02:15:13.710]
So if he's losing in the ratings, then it's all his fault

[02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:20.010]
For example, we cross promote Sid show on the La Bastard show three times while the others get one mentioned if they're lucky

[02:15:20.010 --> 02:15:23.210]
The reason is simply that he's stoo gots his close personal friend

[02:15:23.810 --> 02:15:29.290]
Everybody thinks that Sid has a potentially bigger audience and management here is gonna die trying to prove themselves right

[02:15:29.810 --> 02:15:35.050]
They've moved two producers from the other shows including my former assistant producer to give him a boost and boost his ego

[02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:40.070]
The others including Sadhana are we sent this fact and hates it like poison as a result of this

[02:15:40.070 --> 02:15:42.690]
How do you like that? There's the inside from the fake Hawk Mark

[02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:45.730]
Do we care about this? No, no

[02:15:47.130 --> 02:15:51.930]
In other words, they got some real internal tourists going on over there. Okay. They got there were one no Charlie

[02:15:51.930 --> 02:15:57.750]
They got the love a turd and that's it. That's what they got like a pentonia over and over again. That's all they got

[02:15:58.890 --> 02:15:59.690]
Is levatord

[02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:02.310]
And stoo gots Steve Cohen

[02:16:02.970 --> 02:16:05.430]
Steve Cohen thank you and his brother Marty Marty Cohen

[02:16:06.490 --> 02:16:08.670]
Steve Cohen and Joey Carr

[02:16:09.190 --> 02:16:11.910]
Car Cohen you know same difference. Thank you Steve slug

[02:16:13.390 --> 02:16:17.250]
Steve stolen gave us that info, huh? Yep. Now, this you know if Joey Carr is still alive

[02:16:17.250 --> 02:16:22.390]
Because the audience doesn't have any information or any interest in that whatsoever, which I find shocking

[02:16:24.910 --> 02:16:26.170]
Here's one from Gabriel

[02:16:26.970 --> 02:16:28.870]
How I discovered the near Rogers show

[02:16:30.110 --> 02:16:30.550]
In

[02:16:31.210 --> 02:16:34.170]
2008 my father introduced me to both your show and Rush Limbaugh

[02:16:34.170 --> 02:16:39.210]
Rushes and insane fascist. I was instantly turned off by his ramblings and his skewed view on politics

[02:16:39.210 --> 02:16:41.510]
Your show was the most entertaining I've ever heard

[02:16:41.510 --> 02:16:47.210]
He told me to stir how you helped him learn English by listening to your show during his long drives downtown every morning

[02:16:48.250 --> 02:16:53.190]
Thank you for your service to Miami radio market and continue doing what you do best entertaining happy turdy turret

[02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:54.110]
Well, thanks Gabriel

[02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:58.510]
And here's a poll suggestion what moment would you like at least like to witness

[02:16:59.070 --> 02:17:01.810]
Neil and Joey Jonas going at it. I'd like to witness that

[02:17:03.050 --> 02:17:05.250]
Watch someone spooning with merve

[02:17:06.270 --> 02:17:13.790]
Fleet taking Georgia's job watching that he is sully man having another kid Rush Limbaugh running for president and winning and I'm lifeless

[02:17:16.430 --> 02:17:22.850]
What I'm a lifeless shot like John ZTN other fake shot at least would write in my day. What does that mean? Shut in them. Oh shut in

[02:17:23.690 --> 02:17:24.130]
Oh

[02:17:24.770 --> 02:17:28.790]
Okay, well, thanks a lot for the first part the show is dead need a little bit work. What?

[02:17:30.270 --> 02:17:32.210]
Joey's dead Joey car is dead

[02:17:38.350 --> 02:17:45.830]
Rasta pulses my awesome tax lady surely showed me this if you put the IRS together make one word out of it. It spills theirs

[02:17:48.530 --> 02:17:54.470]
How do you like that is my money becomes theirs the IRS son of a bitch says rasta Paul. Yeah son of a bitch

[02:17:57.190 --> 02:18:00.470]
The fake time jikas is what is WQ I'm gonna do about the two to four hour

[02:18:00.470 --> 02:18:04.770]
Did you say they're bringing mo back no I did not say they're bringing anybody back? I have no idea mo

[02:18:05.250 --> 02:18:09.250]
Have no idea well you talk about running out of material just pathetic

[02:18:10.330 --> 02:18:10.690]
pathetic

[02:18:11.470 --> 02:18:16.350]
Fake Tommy jica we it would be like us running uh, remember that slip slip in that last email

[02:18:16.350 --> 02:18:22.170]
He's trying to cover it up now like a dog running a hundred yards away from his pile and kicking up the dirt behind him

[02:18:24.570 --> 02:18:28.010]
Worst thing is when dogs do that in the house and they're kicking up the carpeting

[02:18:28.010 --> 02:18:32.530]
a lot tiny so hate calls to say yes

[02:18:33.630 --> 02:18:35.530]
The Joey car is dead died about a year ago

[02:18:35.530 --> 02:18:37.790]
Wow and when he was let go

[02:18:38.610 --> 02:18:45.010]
Or when that deal when he was offered that felt bad when they when they showed Hank to door when they stuck him in the back

[02:18:45.010 --> 02:18:47.770]
Yeah, right, uh, and he said but uh, you know about my ratings

[02:18:47.770 --> 02:18:54.430]
I'm number three in the afternoon blah blah blah Joe Bell said ratings don't matter here right what Hank says the Joe said

[02:18:54.430 --> 02:18:55.190]
Mm-hmm

[02:18:55.890 --> 02:18:57.390]
Well, that's good because we don't have any

[02:18:58.670 --> 02:19:02.690]
Good thing we don't care about them and a good thing they don't count because we sure don't have any

[02:19:02.690 --> 02:19:07.990]
Except in January on his show boy, I'm gonna during the break. I'm gonna reach over and pant myself on the back

[02:19:11.490 --> 02:19:14.410]
And now it's time for our long-distance dedication

[02:19:14.970 --> 02:19:24.030]
It's from Hank Goldberg and he writes please play the air that I breathe and dedicated to my Kim Bassinger blow up doll

[02:19:32.690 --> 02:19:37.890]
I'm writing with here I flew I know then dressed up like Kanye Steven that's the deal

[02:19:37.890 --> 02:19:39.910]
Tell you you're forcing me to do this

[02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:42.190]
How about a nice Hawaiian punch

[02:20:02.690 --> 02:20:04.690]
Oh

[02:20:43.110 --> 02:20:43.510]
Oh

[02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:46.330]
You know what Phil Arx says better shocking Gulf dream. It's the first race

[02:20:46.890 --> 02:20:49.690]
There's the even money favorite the five in front by open line

[02:20:49.690 --> 02:20:57.310]
I'll second and I'm cruising to the wire hide a line and east to west until they got side excess capital coming home a winner

[02:20:57.310 --> 02:20:59.750]
Well, I'm telling you about the chalk of course we're not playing that race. So

[02:21:00.310 --> 02:21:05.150]
We got nothing writing on that right we got $50 to win on the six in the second race for Cliff

[02:21:07.050 --> 02:21:08.030]
I sure hope that

[02:21:08.030 --> 02:21:12.470]
Hank's buddy Nick Zito don't win that second race that two horse. He's gonna be the chalk

[02:21:13.310 --> 02:21:16.530]
Moving up cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap. We'll see

[02:21:17.810 --> 02:21:23.790]
Rich says as you very well know a large portion of your caller's faxus e-mailers have absolutely no clue what

[02:21:24.390 --> 02:21:29.730]
What a shot that is what a giveaway neither I nor any my friends have ever had a bad bite of food

[02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:31.610]
To console oak much less a bad meal

[02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:37.070]
The emailer who suggested you try the food court rather than the high-end steakhouse should tell you everything

[02:21:37.070 --> 02:21:39.850]
You need to know about him and his projectile vomiting wife

[02:21:39.850 --> 02:21:43.350]
Oh, what a great line that is I love it

[02:21:44.310 --> 02:21:50.030]
Him and his projectile vomiting wife the sides are overpriced as they are at most high-end state places

[02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:52.650]
But one side order a console can feed two or three people

[02:21:55.150 --> 02:21:55.610]
So

[02:21:55.610 --> 02:22:01.070]
Console oak and something rather on lasola so the two I can't read what it is the two best steak places in the area burn on

[02:22:01.630 --> 02:22:07.850]
I hope that last guy enjoys his turkey club sandwich with lots of pickles next time he said his five star food court says rich

[02:22:08.890 --> 02:22:13.690]
You're getting a little testy with each other now the food fight. It's a food fight. Yeah, I like that

[02:22:14.890 --> 02:22:20.590]
Everybody I've talked to every all the emails of also counsel look at hardwreck is outstanding excellent

[02:22:21.410 --> 02:22:25.370]
Have any near yet first I'd have to be down there to eat there I guess

[02:22:27.130 --> 02:22:31.790]
Kind of a mixed bag, you know a mix a mixed blessing. So Joey Carr is dead. Well, that's good news

[02:22:32.250 --> 02:22:35.210]
He was to me. He was not a pleasant person. I see

[02:22:35.210 --> 02:22:40.590]
I was involved with him by way of the late Bob Savage

[02:22:41.610 --> 02:22:43.990]
The late race caller from call to racetrack

[02:22:45.730 --> 02:22:51.690]
With my late night TV show on channel 51 on on TV whatever hell was remember I talked about that the other day. Yep

[02:22:52.410 --> 02:22:55.350]
We were involved in that and Joey Carr was like I don't know

[02:22:56.070 --> 02:22:58.170]
Real hard ass but nevertheless

[02:22:58.910 --> 02:23:01.090]
dining and dancing and

[02:23:01.870 --> 02:23:02.670]
Clowning around

[02:23:04.830 --> 02:23:09.710]
So what else did Hank have to say anything just that he knew we were on the air and everything

[02:23:11.050 --> 02:23:15.010]
Well, what does that mean? It's like a sit there and have a long projected phone call why not you know

[02:23:15.010 --> 02:23:20.830]
You might give you some inside dope inside poop. Well, I gave him my cell number in case he does have any more dope. Oh good

[02:23:20.830 --> 02:23:24.390]
Yeah, give us the straight dough bank or the gate oak in your case

[02:23:25.210 --> 02:23:26.410]
660 votes on the pool

[02:23:27.010 --> 02:23:34.110]
Speaking of that which occupation though a mochomacho is also a breeding ground for those in the closet closet queens

[02:23:34.630 --> 02:23:36.550]
Hey Jimmy you can

[02:23:38.130 --> 02:23:38.690]
You know

[02:23:38.690 --> 02:23:39.510]
Lifeguard's 135

[02:23:40.310 --> 02:23:46.750]
Firefighters 89 Republicans 81 well Republicans uh from a standing start have gone zooming up the list

[02:23:46.750 --> 02:23:51.590]
They must be thinking about all those toe tapers and about Miss Fowley and of course your gay governor

[02:23:52.510 --> 02:23:53.550]
Limpress Christ

[02:23:54.410 --> 02:23:56.530]
Do you think he's really fooling anybody?

[02:23:57.210 --> 02:24:01.090]
Hmm with that marriage with that beard with that whole fake routine of his

[02:24:01.890 --> 02:24:03.810]
Only the dumbest of the dumb

[02:24:04.450 --> 02:24:08.190]
You'd have to be deaf dumb blind and basically dead

[02:24:08.770 --> 02:24:12.210]
Not to know the Charlie Limpress Chris is a screamer screamer

[02:24:12.770 --> 02:24:13.910]
Not just gay but

[02:24:14.730 --> 02:24:15.810]
Like that

[02:24:16.610 --> 02:24:21.710]
For publicans 81 football player 78. I can't believe those mochow football players like Brady Quinn

[02:24:22.450 --> 02:24:28.550]
Those guys that take showers naked together all the time and slap each other on the ass with the towel and with their hand and with their

[02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:33.870]
Marine 61 sailors 44 cops 44 soldiers 42

[02:24:34.530 --> 02:24:39.770]
Paramedics 39 bounces 21 personal trainers 15 karate black belts 11

[02:24:40.890 --> 02:24:42.290]
Out of 660

[02:24:43.890 --> 02:24:48.210]
So what happened there the Chuck when the first race at Gulf Stream right now we can look up there and see

[02:24:48.210 --> 02:24:50.370]
I don't even know if there's any scratches in the second race

[02:24:51.910 --> 02:24:53.750]
No, there are not feel the seven

[02:24:54.750 --> 02:24:57.650]
And the the horse I picked the six is the a third choice

[02:24:58.190 --> 02:25:02.250]
Three to one one is two to one two is five to two and the six is three to one

[02:25:03.190 --> 02:25:06.470]
So I'd open race you look at the form and you think I don't know

[02:25:06.930 --> 02:25:08.730]
You want to pick this race? I don't want

[02:25:08.730 --> 02:25:13.710]
I don't want it. Why I have no choice. That's the one. You know, it's the second race every Friday

[02:25:15.050 --> 02:25:18.910]
Now the next Zito horse is the two who won resoundingly last time Todd got even

[02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:21.250]
I'm surprised Hank didn't give you little information about that

[02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:23.330]
That's his good buddy next Zito

[02:25:25.130 --> 02:25:28.450]
One by two and a quarter, but he was the truck and he's moving up

[02:25:28.970 --> 02:25:32.790]
In a 30,000 maiden claimer now he's moving up into a non winners of two

[02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:35.870]
35,000 claimer. He's stepping on up

[02:25:36.830 --> 02:25:38.010]
To the east side

[02:25:38.670 --> 02:25:41.890]
Burning blaze on the other hand is taking a big big drop down

[02:25:43.170 --> 02:25:48.390]
Second start after a long layoff. Well, whatever we don't want to intellectualize all this crap

[02:25:48.390 --> 02:25:51.870]
How about Jimmy Cifilis getting 87% of the vote as the worst

[02:25:52.470 --> 02:25:57.830]
The worst sportscaster play by play in all of South Florida and Gellie didn't even make the list

[02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:06.270]
Let's find that very suspicious six are getting a little bit. He says coast second choice five to two

[02:26:07.750 --> 02:26:08.710]
To good sign

[02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:15.010]
Do you understand all this? No, are you ever gonna understand it? I mean, I don't know maybe by the time he dropped dead

[02:26:16.630 --> 02:26:17.310]
Or I do

[02:26:18.910 --> 02:26:23.910]
Why is it that difficult? Why is that compliment? I don't know. It's just it ain't sticking like that idiot

[02:26:23.910 --> 02:26:30.130]
I think I got a couple days ago. Oh, how do you uh? How do you uh go to the track? How do you learn all about it?

[02:26:30.530 --> 02:26:35.170]
How do you learn about horse racing and betting you go there? You buy the racing form and inside the racing form

[02:26:35.170 --> 02:26:38.710]
There's a couple of pages devoted exclusively to how you read the form

[02:26:39.130 --> 02:26:44.570]
And how you use that to bet and make your choice etc and so on tells you all about it like Johnny used to say

[02:26:45.170 --> 02:26:51.250]
Hear all about it call for Philip Morris, whatever he's to say. I think we ought to go back to the days when we had cigarette spots

[02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:57.590]
Why not we have a lot of other poisonous goods that they advertise why not cigarettes

[02:26:58.590 --> 02:27:01.590]
Right why not faggots right freedom of speech, baby

[02:27:03.090 --> 02:27:06.130]
Think it's a disgrace that the candidate for ties new ports Salem

[02:27:06.630 --> 02:27:08.610]
Winston tastes good like a cigarette should

[02:27:09.550 --> 02:27:13.330]
The moral bro man mr. macho probably a screaming queen

[02:27:14.930 --> 02:27:20.730]
Six is back up to three to one so one two and six now what about the one one is Kent to Sermon oh look out

[02:27:21.690 --> 02:27:24.730]
He wrote our 11 horse last week that one for fun good ride

[02:27:27.170 --> 02:27:27.610]
Today

[02:27:29.050 --> 02:27:30.310]
What's the name of that harule?

[02:27:31.390 --> 02:27:32.950]
High rule oh Jeff high rule

[02:27:35.370 --> 02:27:39.730]
Dropping down, but bad race last time bad race

[02:27:40.250 --> 02:27:41.230]
I don't know

[02:27:42.010 --> 02:27:45.970]
We'll see they'll open a gate the horses will run and they'll do their thing and

[02:27:46.650 --> 02:27:53.270]
Life will go on and maybe I'll win cliffs some money and maybe not I've had four winners in six weeks and a second and then a fourth

[02:27:53.790 --> 02:27:56.230]
That dr. Ogedy boogie Oga Oga boogie

[02:27:59.290 --> 02:28:04.290]
That was that was unfortunate got bumped twice out of the gate. That was what it said. There's always an excuse, you know

[02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:06.070]
bump twice at the gate

[02:28:06.570 --> 02:28:06.970]
steady

[02:28:08.450 --> 02:28:10.030]
Stiffed you know like that stiffed

[02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:15.630]
I like when they say a horse was well meant I

[02:28:17.070 --> 02:28:20.090]
Don't know what that means that that means they were trying to win. Oh

[02:28:21.170 --> 02:28:30.010]
Okay, now what what's that opposite of the way as opposed to not well met as opposed to stifferoni stifferoni the San Francisco treat

[02:28:30.010 --> 02:28:34.030]
I mean, what does that mean I don't know well meant

[02:28:36.450 --> 02:28:36.810]
It

[02:28:36.810 --> 02:28:42.130]
It means they were trying to win are we alive are we alive like that you know

[02:28:43.930 --> 02:28:47.370]
Plenty of way the six keeps getting to hit back down to five to two. That's a good sign. He's taking money

[02:28:47.370 --> 02:28:50.530]
When you see a horse that should be a low price and he's not taking any money

[02:28:50.950 --> 02:28:53.550]
Run for the hills run like a son of a bitch

[02:28:55.430 --> 02:28:59.590]
You starting to catch on now a little bit a little bit good one step at a time

[02:29:00.010 --> 02:29:04.490]
I think the day will come when we'll actually have you go to the window and place your own bed

[02:29:04.490 --> 02:29:09.970]
I've done that actually you have not at these things here, but when we've done things there before

[02:29:11.310 --> 02:29:14.390]
In other words when we have done appearances there before

[02:29:15.390 --> 02:29:18.430]
Yeah over the years you went to the window and placed bets

[02:29:18.430 --> 02:29:23.830]
Yeah, somebody wrote down specifically what to say and like a bank robber. I just walked up there with a note

[02:29:23.830 --> 02:29:25.910]
Give me a hundred across on the

[02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:28.090]
Yeah, I had no idea what I was saying

[02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:33.910]
I just laid over the six seven eight over the oh yeah, yeah, I want this I just handed the note in the money

[02:29:33.910 --> 02:29:37.810]
My fat rich used to have tickets under his armpits and his wallet in between his knees

[02:29:37.810 --> 02:29:43.070]
I mean this man after the every race was over he was reaching and then pockets the wallet the

[02:29:45.010 --> 02:29:48.810]
Everywhere arm pits even once in a while pulled one out of his rectum ass

[02:29:48.810 --> 02:29:53.050]
I had this super. I he was such a great guy. I know and then he died

[02:29:53.810 --> 02:29:56.170]
Anyone in a why why fat

[02:29:56.810 --> 02:29:59.730]
And it's Friday you best

[02:29:59.730 --> 02:30:01.190]

[02:30:13.530 --> 02:30:15.670]
You lost the race your complete

[02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:19.990]

[02:30:41.870 --> 02:30:42.290]
You in the mood?

[02:30:42.610 --> 02:30:42.810]
Cute.

[02:30:42.890 --> 02:30:43.310]
I am in the mood.

[02:30:43.370 --> 02:30:43.510]
No.

[02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:44.170]
I mean, to play it.

[02:30:44.170 --> 02:30:45.550]
The six is up to four to one.

[02:30:45.630 --> 02:30:46.590]
He was seven to two.

[02:30:46.730 --> 02:30:47.370]
Back to three to one.

[02:30:47.370 --> 02:30:48.670]
Now he's up to four to one.

[02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:50.690]
Money's all going in on the one and the two.

[02:30:50.810 --> 02:30:51.550]
The AC Doocy.

[02:30:52.250 --> 02:30:53.430]
Four to one is a ten dollar horse.

[02:30:53.630 --> 02:30:54.030]
It's not bad.

[02:30:54.270 --> 02:30:54.970]
50 bucks to one.

[02:30:54.970 --> 02:30:55.750]
I'm ten dollar horse.

[02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:57.090]
250 bucks for cliff.

[02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:58.750]
It stays four to one.

[02:30:59.130 --> 02:30:59.890]
And if it wins.

[02:31:00.730 --> 02:31:01.390]
What is that?

[02:31:01.910 --> 02:31:02.210]
In the mood?

[02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:05.390]
Another lot of burden to this house.

[02:31:05.710 --> 02:31:06.510]
Oh my god.

[02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:08.290]
Who is that?

[02:31:08.990 --> 02:31:09.650]
Ernie Feele.

[02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:11.450]
I remember that.

[02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:19.870]
Okay.

[02:31:21.910 --> 02:31:23.210]
John ZTR says.

[02:31:24.530 --> 02:31:27.730]
You know that I just hear some moron blast me and calling me a fat shut in?

[02:31:27.970 --> 02:31:28.130]
Yes.

[02:31:28.830 --> 02:31:32.630]
Please inform this idiot that I'm an average citizen who gets bored at work has internet and radio access.

[02:31:33.370 --> 02:31:36.750]
I put in ten to thirteen hours a day so I don't know what that moron was talking about.

[02:31:37.170 --> 02:31:41.930]
Anyway, please tell George the movie should be there because I emailed him yesterday and let us usually take a day to get to the destination.

[02:31:42.110 --> 02:31:42.430]
You get it?

[02:31:43.250 --> 02:31:44.230]
No, I'll check it out then.

[02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:44.730]
No.

[02:31:46.250 --> 02:31:48.030]
I mean it might be sitting up front, you know.

[02:31:49.730 --> 02:31:51.610]
It says I emailed him yesterday.

[02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:54.670]
What does that mean?

[02:31:54.770 --> 02:31:55.990]
That's what he says, but I haven't got it.

[02:31:55.990 --> 02:31:56.950]
I think he means he mailed him.

[02:31:57.290 --> 02:31:58.250]
That's probably what he means.

[02:31:58.730 --> 02:32:04.710]
By the way, it's a coincidence that is it a coincidence that January was your highest rate of month or also the month I was sending in emails of full force?

[02:32:04.930 --> 02:32:05.450]
Just kidding.

[02:32:05.810 --> 02:32:06.830]
Yes, just a coincidence.

[02:32:08.210 --> 02:32:12.150]
Anyway, I'll go ahead and reveal another fake identity since you ignored all the following emails from it.

[02:32:12.150 --> 02:32:15.990]
Bart Owen and Raymond, the two idiots who heard from a coworker that Neil is not really gay,

[02:32:16.290 --> 02:32:18.970]
real classic email says John, not.

[02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:24.810]
It was mildly amusing the first time and then he kept following it up and I just kept deleting it because it was so stupid.

[02:32:25.390 --> 02:32:29.130]
Not real classic, not up to your usual standard at all.

[02:32:29.970 --> 02:32:31.590]
So obviously fake.

[02:32:32.190 --> 02:32:35.310]
See, a real good fake email has got to be one that might possibly be real.

[02:32:37.370 --> 02:32:37.810]
Right.

[02:32:38.470 --> 02:32:39.290]
You follow on with Sam?

[02:32:39.790 --> 02:32:39.870]
Yep.

[02:32:39.870 --> 02:32:42.470]
Oh, here's Manny from Kendall with the Mr. Ego update.

[02:32:42.630 --> 02:32:43.070]
We don't care.

[02:32:43.290 --> 02:32:43.990]
Not interested.

[02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:45.530]
He's just desperately reaching out.

[02:32:45.750 --> 02:32:46.930]
I bet you Nick Lawrence sent that one.

[02:32:47.530 --> 02:32:48.150]
Not interested.

[02:32:49.390 --> 02:32:50.490]
Go away, Mr. Ego.

[02:32:50.610 --> 02:32:52.190]
We're not interested in trying to put you on the map.

[02:32:52.510 --> 02:32:54.690]
Just clawing out desperately, reaching.

[02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:56.530]
Please, please talk about me.

[02:32:56.650 --> 02:32:56.770]
No.

[02:32:59.150 --> 02:32:59.950]
No chance.

[02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:00.530]
No shot.

[02:33:03.190 --> 02:33:04.870]
Here's one from Holy P-

[02:33:04.870 --> 02:33:05.510]
Holy P-

[02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:08.030]
Chris is not a Republican.

[02:33:08.190 --> 02:33:08.910]
He's a rhino.

[02:33:09.670 --> 02:33:10.450]
He hasn't done it.

[02:33:10.490 --> 02:33:15.990]
One thing can even be characterized as being remotely conservative and most of his proposals are typical of a Democrat mindset.

[02:33:16.350 --> 02:33:17.470]
Maybe that's because he's gay.

[02:33:17.590 --> 02:33:18.150]
Who the hell knows?

[02:33:19.530 --> 02:33:20.210]
Your governor.

[02:33:20.330 --> 02:33:21.750]
All the six got hit back to three to one.

[02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:22.790]
That's a really good sign.

[02:33:23.570 --> 02:33:24.730]
That's a good sign.

[02:33:26.250 --> 02:33:28.410]
What were those chicksticks or whatever we were talking about yesterday?

[02:33:29.050 --> 02:33:29.050]

[02:33:30.090 --> 02:33:31.370]
I don't recall the name.

[02:33:32.370 --> 02:33:33.890]
I looked at him and I thought, well, maybe.

[02:33:33.890 --> 02:33:34.330]
I don't know.

[02:33:34.890 --> 02:33:35.930]
And maybe not forever.

[02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:37.690]
You did what?

[02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:38.250]
They're ancient.

[02:33:38.390 --> 02:33:39.030]
The bitter off, forever.

[02:33:40.650 --> 02:33:42.470]
So we got 10 minutes till the second race.

[02:33:42.470 --> 02:33:43.490]
It's going to go off at 144.

[02:33:44.950 --> 02:33:45.950]
The one is two to one.

[02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:46.810]
The two is nine to five.

[02:33:46.810 --> 02:33:47.790]
And the six is third choice.

[02:33:47.790 --> 02:33:48.330]
Three to one.

[02:33:48.890 --> 02:33:51.210]
And those three keep like road rotating.

[02:33:54.490 --> 02:33:55.530]
Five to two on the one.

[02:33:55.650 --> 02:33:56.550]
Nine to five on the two.

[02:33:56.610 --> 02:33:57.490]
Three to one on the six.

[02:33:57.890 --> 02:33:58.570]
Yada, yada, yada.

[02:33:59.170 --> 02:33:59.810]
Anybody here?

[02:33:59.930 --> 02:34:00.090]
No.

[02:34:00.210 --> 02:34:01.610]
Cliff cares whoever Cliff is.

[02:34:02.930 --> 02:34:04.670]
Are contestant on the pick up pony deal.

[02:34:04.810 --> 02:34:08.250]
Now, when you go back out there again March 27, did you say correct?

[02:34:09.430 --> 02:34:10.310]
Wow, what a memory.

[02:34:11.770 --> 02:34:18.730]
And I think this time the station ought to give you like maybe five, six hundred bucks to plunge your guts on the first two races.

[02:34:20.490 --> 02:34:21.790]
Do you think that makes sense?

[02:34:22.050 --> 02:34:22.510]
It sure does.

[02:34:22.910 --> 02:34:26.450]
Weel some triples and bet on some cripples and whatever, you know.

[02:34:27.470 --> 02:34:29.510]
Seven to two on the six nine dollar house.

[02:34:31.210 --> 02:34:32.130]
Pretty interesting.

[02:34:32.210 --> 02:34:33.810]
The way in the five is taken somebody to.

[02:34:35.130 --> 02:34:35.590]
Eon.

[02:34:36.810 --> 02:34:40.630]
It'll be an Eon before he reaches the finish line with Cornelio Velasquez.

[02:34:42.890 --> 02:34:46.790]
There's your horrejo Velasquez and John Velasquez and Cornelio.

[02:34:47.070 --> 02:34:48.850]
Lots of Velasquez is in so many little time.

[02:34:50.350 --> 02:34:52.250]
Four horses getting bent in the seven horse field.

[02:34:52.250 --> 02:34:53.450]
Well, that means it's wide open.

[02:34:53.610 --> 02:34:54.090]
Is that what that means?

[02:34:55.070 --> 02:34:55.930]
Is that what that means?

[02:34:59.310 --> 02:35:04.210]
Oh, boy, here's one from Ricardo Santorea, whatever the hell his name is.

[02:35:04.370 --> 02:35:05.130]
He started yesterday.

[02:35:06.850 --> 02:35:09.590]
John and Lake Worth is also wondering, again, two, he must be bored today.

[02:35:10.050 --> 02:35:13.730]
The guy who emailed you was partially correct when he said it was entirely the fault of the people about these homes.

[02:35:14.090 --> 02:35:15.790]
Oh, it goes on and on and on and on.

[02:35:17.030 --> 02:35:19.630]
Okay, let's do the break a little early because we don't want to miss the race.

[02:35:19.870 --> 02:35:20.550]
Oh, Neil!

[02:35:20.750 --> 02:35:22.090]
You're listening to Neil Rogers.

[02:35:22.470 --> 02:35:23.010]
Neil Rogers.

[02:35:23.010 --> 02:35:23.310]
God.

[02:35:30.530 --> 02:35:36.290]
I was riding on a train to Austin, Texas.

[02:35:37.550 --> 02:35:43.170]
Oh, and a very lovely lady said next to mine.

[02:35:45.370 --> 02:35:52.070]
When she got a ticket, she asked to buy what holds her sight.

[02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:55.510]
I was more than happy too.

[02:35:56.670 --> 02:35:59.490]
And now there's more I'd like to do.

[02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:04.870]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[02:36:06.670 --> 02:36:11.970]
I want to whisper, so we've nothing in her rear.

[02:36:13.850 --> 02:36:21.090]
I want to hold her behind closed doors and more.

[02:36:22.030 --> 02:36:27.170]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[02:36:28.810 --> 02:36:34.430]
When she returned, she said she was an actress.

[02:36:36.230 --> 02:36:43.750]
She showed me an album of pictures of her opening, which she then said she'd known.

[02:36:44.730 --> 02:36:50.310]
She seemed as if she could be, but I could clearly see.

[02:36:50.810 --> 02:36:56.630]
She was the kind of girl whose old man's heart's system right now.

[02:36:57.130 --> 02:36:57.470]
Right now.

[02:36:58.930 --> 02:37:03.610]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[02:37:03.610 --> 02:37:10.630]
I want to whisper, so we've nothing in her rear.

[02:37:12.730 --> 02:37:19.850]
I want to hold her behind closed doors and more.

[02:37:21.630 --> 02:37:25.870]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[02:37:27.590 --> 02:37:33.130]
Well, I'll never forget that train ride down to Austin.

[02:37:35.330 --> 02:37:40.530]
We share the sweet, and we shared our tales.

[02:37:42.730 --> 02:37:49.910]
But as my heart tries to leave her behind, regrets are all not fine.

[02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:55.430]
Because I hope that you'll get that girl in the end.

[02:37:58.350 --> 02:38:03.010]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[02:38:04.110 --> 02:38:04.650]
You're fair.

[02:38:05.330 --> 02:38:10.130]
I want to whisper, so we've nothing in her rear.

[02:38:12.250 --> 02:38:19.530]
I want to hold her behind closed doors and more.

[02:38:21.110 --> 02:38:32.490]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[02:38:34.530 --> 02:38:35.530]
What an excellent timing.

[02:38:35.710 --> 02:38:36.130]
Thank you.

[02:38:36.890 --> 02:38:37.270]
144.

[02:38:38.010 --> 02:38:38.510]
Post time.

[02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:39.190]
They're going to the gate.

[02:38:40.170 --> 02:38:40.850]
Are they good?

[02:38:41.190 --> 02:38:41.630]
That's excellent.

[02:38:41.830 --> 02:38:43.850]
I mean, they're like, poaching around their body.

[02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:45.630]
They're approaching the Greek.

[02:38:45.730 --> 02:38:46.590]
You ever so slowly.

[02:38:46.870 --> 02:38:47.790]
Who made you can't see it?

[02:38:47.790 --> 02:38:52.450]
And the bad, well, the good news is it's a price, nine to two, $11 horse if he wins.

[02:38:53.310 --> 02:38:56.910]
Because the money, the two got plunged down out of six to five, almost even money.

[02:38:57.150 --> 02:38:58.090]
That's the next needle horse.

[02:38:58.430 --> 02:38:59.290]
One is five to two.

[02:38:59.810 --> 02:39:02.370]
Five is four to one, and the six is the fourth choice of nine to two.

[02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:06.070]
Might as well get a price once you already made the bet.

[02:39:06.210 --> 02:39:06.610]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:39:07.090 --> 02:39:07.230]
Right.

[02:39:08.230 --> 02:39:09.110]
They're going to the gate.

[02:39:10.970 --> 02:39:11.830]
There's the doose.

[02:39:12.350 --> 02:39:13.750]
He'll be followed by a native.

[02:39:15.310 --> 02:39:17.170]
Nader and Broadway Bobby.

[02:39:17.210 --> 02:39:18.750]
Talk about a loser, that old Nader.

[02:39:20.170 --> 02:39:21.550]
E on the next one.

[02:39:22.090 --> 02:39:23.950]
Apsulacha season, the seven post.

[02:39:25.090 --> 02:39:28.210]
And the last two to load are burning blaze and bio hazard.

[02:39:29.230 --> 02:39:33.970]
Nine to two, $11 times 50 is $275 for Cliff if we win.

[02:39:34.730 --> 02:39:36.810]
Confidence is minimal.

[02:39:37.790 --> 02:39:38.490]
You know what I mean by that?

[02:39:39.490 --> 02:39:39.730]
No.

[02:39:40.290 --> 02:39:40.990]
Well, we'll see.

[02:39:40.990 --> 02:39:41.950]
I'm going to use the bottom of them.

[02:39:42.030 --> 02:39:42.450]
Can't win them.

[02:39:42.510 --> 02:39:43.610]
Can't pick a winner every week.

[02:39:45.390 --> 02:39:47.450]
I'm picking it.

[02:39:48.130 --> 02:39:50.790]
The bio hazard up to the outside gate.

[02:39:52.190 --> 02:39:53.810]
With ET beard no less.

[02:39:53.910 --> 02:39:54.130]
Wow.

[02:39:54.930 --> 02:39:56.630]
Been off a long time.

[02:39:57.350 --> 02:39:58.310]
And the horse too.

[02:39:58.850 --> 02:39:59.750]
And the only line.

[02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.650]
They're in the gate.

[02:40:00.850 --> 02:40:02.990]
Six looks like he wants to just fly out of there and he didn't.

[02:40:03.770 --> 02:40:05.110]
He came out awkwardly.

[02:40:05.110 --> 02:40:06.270]
I don't know why he's in there.

[02:40:06.430 --> 02:40:06.890]
He's in there.

[02:40:07.070 --> 02:40:09.170]
Todd got even an e-honor right there.

[02:40:09.550 --> 02:40:10.450]
Burning blaze is over.

[02:40:10.450 --> 02:40:13.690]
Running in fourth and then high rule later and brought way close to the base.

[02:40:13.690 --> 02:40:14.850]
He's about to like something.

[02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:16.130]
He run up the back stretch.

[02:40:16.370 --> 02:40:16.910]
Now he's stirred.

[02:40:17.110 --> 02:40:18.870]
Got even on the inside and e-hon.

[02:40:19.070 --> 02:40:22.270]
They're right together on the leave and burning blaze is just off of them.

[02:40:22.710 --> 02:40:23.650]
And high right there.

[02:40:23.650 --> 02:40:24.770]
Let me tell you right now.

[02:40:24.910 --> 02:40:25.630]
He's got a horse.

[02:40:25.770 --> 02:40:26.110]
He's third.

[02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:27.530]
Outside of them comes bio hazard.

[02:40:28.030 --> 02:40:28.270]
Broadway.

[02:40:28.370 --> 02:40:28.730]
What do you think?

[02:40:29.370 --> 02:40:30.290]
Is trailing the field.

[02:40:30.310 --> 02:40:30.610]
I don't know.

[02:40:30.650 --> 02:40:31.170]
Can't see the four lengths.

[02:40:31.170 --> 02:40:31.890]
Two and a five.

[02:40:32.130 --> 02:40:33.830]
Four, six is still on the outside.

[02:40:34.030 --> 02:40:34.710]
Twenty-three and two.

[02:40:35.430 --> 02:40:37.130]
Todd got even an neck in front.

[02:40:37.870 --> 02:40:38.790]
E-hon to the outside.

[02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:39.950]
The five is pressing the two.

[02:40:40.250 --> 02:40:41.410]
And here comes the six.

[02:40:41.830 --> 02:40:42.890]
Moving up on the outside.

[02:40:42.970 --> 02:40:43.670]
He's got some horse.

[02:40:43.890 --> 02:40:44.350]
They're in third.

[02:40:44.970 --> 02:40:47.110]
High rule is pushed along fourth along the rail.

[02:40:47.570 --> 02:40:48.490]
Nader right alongside.

[02:40:49.210 --> 02:40:51.810]
Outside of them bio hazard and Broadway, Bobby Z.

[02:40:51.850 --> 02:40:52.530]
And two and a five.

[02:40:52.670 --> 02:40:53.710]
Still side by each.

[02:40:53.790 --> 02:40:54.910]
Todd got even an e-hon.

[02:40:55.070 --> 02:40:55.990]
And the six is right there.

[02:40:56.110 --> 02:40:57.350]
Thirty-six and two.

[02:40:57.730 --> 02:40:59.110]
Come on, A-bar, I-bar.

[02:40:59.290 --> 02:41:00.010]
He's in high order.

[02:41:00.310 --> 02:41:00.710]
He's in this good field.

[02:41:01.590 --> 02:41:02.590]
And they've left the others behind.

[02:41:02.590 --> 02:41:03.430]
Good on the buzzer.

[02:41:03.530 --> 02:41:04.890]
Coming to the top of the stretch.

[02:41:05.250 --> 02:41:08.050]
It's Todd got even grinding out a narrow distance.

[02:41:08.050 --> 02:41:09.370]
And we had to turn for home.

[02:41:09.570 --> 02:41:10.230]
The damn two.

[02:41:10.390 --> 02:41:10.730]
The next two.

[02:41:10.870 --> 02:41:10.910]
The next two.

[02:41:10.970 --> 02:41:11.790]
Still second.

[02:41:11.950 --> 02:41:13.470]
And the six is hanging behind them.

[02:41:13.870 --> 02:41:15.110]
And burning blazes fourth.

[02:41:15.230 --> 02:41:16.610]
And the final for long.

[02:41:16.970 --> 02:41:18.550]
Todd got even an Joe Bravo.

[02:41:19.090 --> 02:41:19.790]
Have the lead.

[02:41:19.890 --> 02:41:21.170]
Todd, I'll tell you.

[02:41:21.230 --> 02:41:21.670]
Bet the chalk.

[02:41:21.850 --> 02:41:22.250]
Yeah.

[02:41:22.430 --> 02:41:23.530]
Nix Zito in the two.

[02:41:23.610 --> 02:41:24.630]
Two on the rail.

[02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:26.510]
Todd got even wins it.

[02:41:27.130 --> 02:41:27.770]
Sorry, Cliff.

[02:41:28.150 --> 02:41:30.290]
He was right there.

[02:41:30.370 --> 02:41:31.990]
Most of the race and then puked his guts.

[02:41:33.430 --> 02:41:34.030]
The two.

[02:41:34.150 --> 02:41:34.470]
The chalk.

[02:41:34.610 --> 02:41:35.350]
Who got one?

[02:41:35.470 --> 02:41:35.890]
Three to two.

[02:41:35.930 --> 02:41:36.570]
That's five bucks.

[02:41:36.570 --> 02:41:37.030]
Right.

[02:41:37.650 --> 02:41:40.110]
It's 125 bucks for Cliff if we have picked the two.

[02:41:40.390 --> 02:41:41.270]
I don't want to pick the chalk.

[02:41:42.270 --> 02:41:45.210]
And then Phil Arck is going to say, oh, you shouldn't go with the chalk.

[02:41:45.350 --> 02:41:46.510]
I told you I always bet the chalk.

[02:41:46.710 --> 02:41:47.750]
Screw you, Mr. Ricksburg.

[02:41:48.790 --> 02:41:49.750]
And there are.

[02:41:51.250 --> 02:41:53.010]
There's a little bonus coverage for you like that.

[02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.970]
Yeah.

[02:41:55.270 --> 02:41:56.510]
Okay, let's get back to.

[02:41:56.690 --> 02:41:57.730]
Sorry, Cliff.

[02:41:57.890 --> 02:41:58.690]
I gave up my best shot.

[02:41:58.830 --> 02:42:00.190]
I told you the confidence was immediately over.

[02:42:00.510 --> 02:42:01.690]
Tough race, four horse race.

[02:42:01.950 --> 02:42:02.610]
We finished fourth.

[02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:06.910]
Ricardo says about Charlie Christie's not gay.

[02:42:06.970 --> 02:42:08.850]
He just runs naked on the beach with his close friends.

[02:42:09.290 --> 02:42:11.770]
Oh, this is the fake gym defeat of Santana from Alabama.

[02:42:12.490 --> 02:42:14.730]
And you know, I miss these bits and yadda.

[02:42:14.850 --> 02:42:18.070]
I was like, whatever quit living in the past.

[02:42:18.070 --> 02:42:19.510]
Okay, we're doing the best we can.

[02:42:19.610 --> 02:42:21.290]
We had a kick ass January, baby.

[02:42:21.430 --> 02:42:21.770]
Right.

[02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:23.830]
As kicker.

[02:42:24.670 --> 02:42:27.830]
Men 25 54 boy, we still got a shot at some money.

[02:42:27.850 --> 02:42:31.370]
If we get a few more wire diaries, maybe if Betty will help us out.

[02:42:31.370 --> 02:42:31.870]
Come on, Betty.

[02:42:33.410 --> 02:42:36.030]
Of course, Betty's a, well, maybe she can be a man for a month.

[02:42:37.110 --> 02:42:38.450]
Maybe she can be queen for a day.

[02:42:39.510 --> 02:42:39.770]
Betty.

[02:42:41.310 --> 02:42:50.110]
John from Lake Worth says the guy who emailed you was partially correct when he said it was entirely the fall of the people of Bought These Homes only to find they couldn't refinance them later on when their interest rates increased.

[02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:56.410]
I agree with the majority of the people who bought these homes for first time home buyers who only wanted a piece of the American dream.

[02:42:56.710 --> 02:42:57.370]
They wanted a piece.

[02:42:57.370 --> 02:42:59.730]
It's 15 freaking degrees, baby, in Toronto.

[02:43:00.310 --> 02:43:01.450]
59 holy cow.

[02:43:02.490 --> 02:43:05.010]
It's a good thing that they got to go pick up the pizza to a clock.

[02:43:06.430 --> 02:43:09.390]
The oldest delivery, I mean, oldest delivery boy in North America.

[02:43:09.970 --> 02:43:10.530]
Probably not.

[02:43:11.070 --> 02:43:15.650]
The predatory lenders who went on check in a Republican administration who to this day did not believe in any form regulation.

[02:43:16.410 --> 02:43:18.590]
As much as they deregulated, the society sounds good.

[02:43:18.690 --> 02:43:19.910]
It can and will not work.

[02:43:20.230 --> 02:43:22.190]
People get greedy and they're left unchecked.

[02:43:22.190 --> 02:43:23.970]
Well, rape the American people at every turn.

[02:43:24.110 --> 02:43:24.450]
That's right.

[02:43:24.810 --> 02:43:28.170]
Rape like Mo would say gang rape ain't funny or whatever you said.

[02:43:29.210 --> 02:43:30.150]
Is that what Mo said?

[02:43:31.370 --> 02:43:32.070]
All time.

[02:43:32.570 --> 02:43:38.690]
As much as we hate the government telling us what to do, it is imperative to have them be the watchdogs over some aspects of our lives to ensure we're not getting screwed.

[02:43:39.050 --> 02:43:39.650]
Have a nice weekend.

[02:43:39.790 --> 02:43:40.730]
You too, John, the Lake Worth.

[02:43:41.630 --> 02:43:43.750]
And thanks for your perspricated observations.

[02:43:44.270 --> 02:43:44.870]
Whatever that means.

[02:43:46.570 --> 02:43:48.350]
So we found out today some important stuff.

[02:43:48.470 --> 02:43:49.290]
Joey Carr is dead.

[02:43:51.670 --> 02:43:53.450]
The chalk always wins a Gulf Stream.

[02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:56.850]
I'm sure Phil Archer is going to be chiming in and he's like, oh, I told you about the chalk.

[02:43:57.010 --> 02:43:57.190]
Where?

[02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.710]
Maybe not.

[02:44:02.970 --> 02:44:06.830]
Here is an interesting just wondering once to know what are the rules of your show?

[02:44:07.590 --> 02:44:09.090]
What is the reason you can't play Farts on?

[02:44:09.310 --> 02:44:10.350]
Because Joyce don't want them.

[02:44:11.230 --> 02:44:13.130]
What happens if he accidentally let one out?

[02:44:13.490 --> 02:44:14.750]
Do you get fine for this too?

[02:44:15.430 --> 02:44:15.830]
Ooh.

[02:44:16.990 --> 02:44:17.970]
Yeah, it's fine.

[02:44:19.530 --> 02:44:22.930]
Joey Reynolds comment on the, how could you be tied for eighth place with W-I-N-Z?

[02:44:23.050 --> 02:44:23.730]
How is this possible?

[02:44:24.030 --> 02:44:25.770]
When is the FCC going to grant the power increase?

[02:44:26.130 --> 02:44:27.710]
You can't hear the station west of the turnpike.

[02:44:27.950 --> 02:44:28.830]
Well, that's part of the problem.

[02:44:28.890 --> 02:44:30.290]
That's how we're tied with W-I-N-Z.

[02:44:30.970 --> 02:44:32.930]
When you can't hear the station, you don't listen to it.

[02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:39.590]
Here is one that says, wow, that was either really exciting where I have absolutely no life.

[02:44:39.890 --> 02:44:42.610]
You're still a man off on the a burning blaze, more like flaming queen.

[02:44:43.410 --> 02:44:45.950]
I'm still going to donate 50 bucks to pet rescue of Miami. Well, good.

[02:44:46.590 --> 02:44:49.270]
Well, the cliff in Kendall, he was a contestant.

[02:44:50.610 --> 02:44:51.410]
I thought it was something.

[02:44:51.530 --> 02:44:54.390]
Then I say that to you when you told me it was cliff, I thought I mentioned that's cliff in Kendall.

[02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:57.950]
Well, sorry, cliff, because you were a good guy and sent us a lot of good email crap and stuff.

[02:44:58.370 --> 02:45:01.790]
And I wish you could have won, but the truck, I just can't keep betting the truck.

[02:45:02.630 --> 02:45:06.770]
My concept of betting at the track is beat the truck, not all the time, but most of the time.

[02:45:07.010 --> 02:45:07.910]
How about eat the truck?

[02:45:08.350 --> 02:45:09.010]
Yeah, eat the truck.

[02:45:09.090 --> 02:45:11.530]
That's usually what you do is eat the truck, 70% of the time.

[02:45:12.910 --> 02:45:14.730]
Rick James says, happy anniversary.

[02:45:14.910 --> 02:45:16.030]
I wrote a poem for you.

[02:45:16.570 --> 02:45:17.830]
Neil, Neil, Neil on the wall.

[02:45:17.930 --> 02:45:19.190]
You're the guest radio host of the mall.

[02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:20.730]
Congratulations from Rick James.

[02:45:20.970 --> 02:45:21.510]
So thanks Rick.

[02:45:22.110 --> 02:45:22.690]
Very creative.

[02:45:24.630 --> 02:45:27.810]
Larry says, when I invited you to the council, I knew you wouldn't go.

[02:45:28.010 --> 02:45:30.230]
Just trying to show you there are some nice listeners out there.

[02:45:30.450 --> 02:45:31.070]
Well, thanks, Larry.

[02:45:32.370 --> 02:45:34.570]
I still think Ruth Chris or Peter Lurgers is better.

[02:45:35.430 --> 02:45:36.570]
What about Morton's?

[02:45:36.650 --> 02:45:37.830]
Is Morton's chop liver or what?

[02:45:38.050 --> 02:45:38.930]
If you eat an Morton's?

[02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:40.630]
Yeah, what's?

[02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:41.210]
I was very good.

[02:45:41.210 --> 02:45:41.550]
You like it?

[02:45:41.710 --> 02:45:42.130]
It was very good.

[02:45:42.650 --> 02:45:42.810]
Oh.

[02:45:43.390 --> 02:45:44.810]
Well, Rita makes the dinner great.

[02:45:44.890 --> 02:45:47.810]
Is when the hard rock comps the $200 check for being a high roller.

[02:45:48.430 --> 02:45:52.050]
Tell George, breathing, breaking bad starts new sunlight.

[02:45:52.810 --> 02:45:53.150]
Okay.

[02:45:53.630 --> 02:45:54.450]
What does that mean?

[02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:56.450]
It's a series I think it's on FX.

[02:45:56.470 --> 02:45:57.090]
Very good.

[02:46:03.750 --> 02:46:06.870]
Oh, Carolman Picard, the attorney used to fax me whom moved to Pittsburgh.

[02:46:07.370 --> 02:46:07.850]
Amber Carolyn?

[02:46:08.490 --> 02:46:08.670]
No.

[02:46:08.790 --> 02:46:10.030]
She was a regular fax here.

[02:46:10.030 --> 02:46:12.550]
I'm calling Ray Charlie, Chris.

[02:46:13.030 --> 02:46:16.910]
I can't get over how no one wonders about him, although it's none of their business.

[02:46:18.530 --> 02:46:21.770]
Anyway, I miss hearing you except when I'm home not working.

[02:46:22.930 --> 02:46:24.250]
Try to get an iPhone.

[02:46:24.850 --> 02:46:25.690]
Why need to get an iPhone?

[02:46:25.990 --> 02:46:26.470]
It's just Carolman.

[02:46:26.990 --> 02:46:28.450]
I'm reading it off the monitor, you know.

[02:46:28.910 --> 02:46:30.770]
In my eyes a little blurry after watching that race.

[02:46:31.790 --> 02:46:32.690]
Six was right there.

[02:46:32.770 --> 02:46:33.510]
Most of the way it was.

[02:46:33.650 --> 02:46:34.410]
He had a good shot.

[02:46:34.450 --> 02:46:35.490]
He was right there in contention.

[02:46:35.610 --> 02:46:38.810]
Then when they came to the top of the stretch, he looked down the stretch like a lot of horses do.

[02:46:38.810 --> 02:46:40.970]
Saw the finish line was way down there.

[02:46:41.050 --> 02:46:42.550]
Anyway, like that.

[02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:43.350]
He peeps his guts.

[02:46:43.550 --> 02:46:45.590]
He went like that.

[02:46:46.850 --> 02:46:48.730]
Six hundred eighty five votes on the pool.

[02:46:49.710 --> 02:46:54.570]

[02:46:59.390 --> 02:47:00.310]
Is that a job?

[02:47:02.930 --> 02:47:04.050]
Well, that's my bad.

[02:47:04.370 --> 02:47:05.150]

[02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:11.430]

[02:47:20.030 --> 02:47:23.810]
Now maybe somebody can explain that to me that last one. Karate Blackbelts.

[02:47:24.050 --> 02:47:25.370]
I've never noticed a correlation.

[02:47:26.330 --> 02:47:26.490]
Oh.

[02:47:26.890 --> 02:47:28.350]
But I only have ever known a couple.

[02:47:29.010 --> 02:47:33.150]
Well, you know, sometimes those belts are on the pantaloonies and you know what's inside the pantaloonies.

[02:47:33.190 --> 02:47:33.450]
Oh, me!

[02:47:33.750 --> 02:47:35.150]
You're nothing to me, Rogers.

[02:47:35.470 --> 02:47:35.610]
