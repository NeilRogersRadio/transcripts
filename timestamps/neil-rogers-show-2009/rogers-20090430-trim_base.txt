[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.300]
Braiding today

[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.300]
Mark the guys across the street interpret the ratings differently. Yeah, the way they want to don't wait

[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.980]
The people who picture about the ratings are the ones who don't have any oh

[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.700]
That a coincidence no

[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.340]
It's a fact I say I

[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.960]
Play the right open today. I don't care

[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.660]
No, I don't think we're gonna have it open today time to talk sports

[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.980]
I got yesterday's thing on here. It's a bad thing

[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.600]
Well, I had to

[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.200]
Turn the phone part on you know how that works. They're all both running on the same computer

[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.200]
Yeah, Ian

And you know

[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.840]
Beautiful woman in no what in the middle of the slump

[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.800]
Here is a bit of the real America son ladies and gentlemen

[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:41.260]
Well, that was really something that was a hell now very auspicious debut for the show today

[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.540]
10 a 1 at 5 60 W Q a.m. Happy Thursday to its ratings day any minute now

[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.740]
They're gonna be coming in there with a look on their puts either a look of relief and

[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.200]
Extasy or now let's see who's gonna be handing that flee

[00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.000]
I don't know our program director is busy off getting married. Where did they go to Vegas? I don't know sorry

[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.980]
Well, you sure out of touch

[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.340]
I'm very in touch with things that matter to me that I care about you don't care about clearance getting married

[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.120]
I know better head to me. Oh wait

[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.860]
So somebody I guess flea will come running in there with a look on his face like hey, we did pretty good or oh boy

[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.180]
We have a bad March January February and March. This is the winter rating book. Oh

[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.700]
Boy

[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.100]
Yeah, well I'll get to hot marks email through the amusing about how they interpret the ratings differently across the street

[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.760]
And I'll say it for the eight million time

[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.820]
We are competing on this show with the guys across the street. We're competing with IOD

[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.920]
No, there be neither notice or ought to be I bet you're pardon. I said how's it going?

[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.300]
What'd you say there be meath our notice? No, that's not the point the point is it's a sport station

[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.960]
We don't do a sports show so the fact that the rest of the 20 hours on this station

[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.420]
They're all foaming at the mouth with each other. That's that's fine

[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.520]
But that's not our competition

[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.000]
Especially when they're doing like ones and two shares in there how that can be anybody's competition

[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.400]
But we'll get to that email from hawk mark. I think it's from the real one. He's your buddy. Yeah, you got so many buddies man

[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.220]
I know that rooster or a choo rooster codburn. Yeah

[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.260]
Thousand up 101 points boy. This is gonna be hell of a day. I have a feeling in the pit of my rectum the pit of my

[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.920]
rectum that we might do okay and

[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.220]
We have another where let's see Dave Johnson's gonna be calling you love him for our annual Kentucky Derby preview

[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.960]
Yep, and flea says we have another online giveaway scheduled in the new hour today the prize is $50 to the

[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.020]

[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.380]
For the online listeners. That's that's kind of nice that we're doing that

[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.880]
Mm-hmm. Got a lot of people listening online between our website and between the QA website. There's a lot of people listening online

[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.620]
every day

[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.560]
few

[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.400]
Swine flu cases suspected in Miami. Oh my god in Dave County

[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.060]
Fred Tasker wrote this G. It's amazing that he's still alive Fred Tasker where he's been around a long time at the Harold

[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.220]
He must be one of the ten employees who are still employed there

[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.760]
It's a really strange

[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.300]
Strange period that we're going through now you know between the

[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.500]
Depression and the swine flu

[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.600]
All the other crap that's going on

[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.580]
20 possible but on confirmed swine flu cases have been identified in Dave County and

[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.460]
Undetermined number in Broward. They're not talking in Broward. They won't tell you how many

[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.220]
Health officials said yesterday, but it could be several days before the test results come back to confirm them

[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.960]
The cases are considered suspect because the patients have flu systems that have traveled to Mexico or other areas where the swine flu has been identified

[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.480]
Said Dr. Vincent Coddy chief epidemiologist at the Dave Health Department if they have fever and respiratory

[00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.280]
Respiratory systems and they've traveled they meet the definition for testing County said

[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.700]
Also yesterday, and I'm sure maybe as some of you saw it

[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.940]
I saw it the W. H. O took the unprecedented step of raising the infectious disease alert to

[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.300]
Phase five. Oh my God sending the stage for increased efforts to combat the infection

[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.200]
I don't want to say that they're getting people in a just total panic, but of course you know

[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.120]
Don't see and of course stick your nose in the crack. What is it in your armpit? Yes?

[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.640]
The candy in the crevice and the stick your nose in the crack

[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.480]
That's what they're suggesting if you're gonna sneeze knees in the crack of your elbow or some

[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.660]
Mediotic thing like that. I guess Ron Jeremy is you know, he's

[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.520]
He's able to do things like that. He's triple-jointed me myself. I'm crippled jointed and anyway

[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.600]
That's the deal there. There's some swine flu cases in Dayton Broward suspected suspected

[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.900]
That's the operative word suspected. They don't know and in a few days

[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.160]
Maybe we'll find out

[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:11.860]
I'm pretty much over this crap that I had there was not the sh� and flu it was huh as it could that was up 111 points wow

[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.340]
Hock Mark sends this most amusing email this morning

[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:23.040]
Hock Mark executive producer of the Dan LaBastard show on sports talk 790 the ticket ticket ticket ticket at the ticket

[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.720]
And then in a signature on here at the bottom Twitter with us. He's got a link to the Twitter dot com at the LaBastard show and that exciting

[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.600]
Twitter with us. We don't Twitter on the show. We don't Facebook. We don't Twitter and we share this all don't do my space

[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.960]
That thing is dead than a door nail. Yeah, and amazing how that was that was the big thing for a long time and all of a sudden and

[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.840]
Facebook's been there for a long time

[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.840]
Yep, but all of a sudden everybody decided one day. Oh, we don't wear a board with my space. Let's go to Facebook

[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.120]
And then that wasn't exciting enough. Let's Twitter

[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.040]
Yeah, I know a lot of people who Twitter

[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.940]
Hock marks is I know the ratings say what they say they say what they say that's a really good line

[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:11.080]
But the perception of those ratings here is much different meaning across the street and that's because they don't have any the

[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.160]
Management here

[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.200]
sincerely believes that we have bigger numbers of people listening to the station than this QIM. Yeah, you should live so long

[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.880]
The theory is that only old people listen to the radio at home only old people answer their land lines because they don't look at

[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.200]
Callers I can't to make that word out and only old people actually get diaries lots of bunch of crap

[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.220]
If only old people actually get diaries then how come the demos shows teenagers 18 to 24 and all that?

[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:43.600]
Shut up old man. Yeah, we supposedly have a he says we supposedly have a younger audience a bigger audience who listens

[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.400]
Intermittently throughout the day and mostly in the car

[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.120]
So the hope is that once the new measurement is in effect the ratings will be flipped in our favor

[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.660]
They point to bigger numbers actually says he says what it's called, but we're not we're not allowed to say that

[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:57.580]
Right

[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:03.620]
They point to bigger numbers of people who show up at our appearances and participate in our you're gonna love this polls

[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:09.780]
Yeah, you know, I like I like to challenge them to have their polls set up like real polls like ours

[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:15.380]
All the other ones where you can only vote once and not like a hundred times right and where they actually show how many people have voted right

[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.080]
Let's see how many people really are on those polls. I just sit in there. Oh look at that

[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.100]
We got four million votes on the pool today anybody can just make up a number

[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.620]
Right and so we could we could actually have the poll number be whatever we wanted it to right here

[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.880]
Can make it and sure whatever we 500 million more people that are already done that a couple of times remember that yep

[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.960]
So enjoy it while it lasts Neil and enjoy what?

[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.140]
That's what Steve white and La Bastard say and by the way, I think Steve

[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.360]
Why it's getting better numbers than Sid did says hawkmark?

[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:48.140]
I know that doesn't say much for him as PD, but maybe as a host. Yeah, you should live so long. They don't have a morning show

[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.360]
Here it's the 30th 30th

[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.520]
30 man, I'm April and they don't have a morning show. Are those numbers coming over already? Yep. Oh, no now

[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.080]
What's the story you smiling? I don't know

[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.240]
Get any kind of a read I did not well

[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.580]
Let me do the break just a tad early here and then during the break

[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:09.720]
I can like start to organize get my stapler out. You know how I have my system right I got like an assembly line going

[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.420]
I got plenty of facts paper there stuck in that machine. Hopefully they old. I haven't got the new drum

[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:21.040]
It'll be in today. Let's see if these are print now overall up a little bit. Yeah, what overall up a little bit

[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.420]
That first number that we always see yeah, the entire station now you mean men 2554

[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.740]
That's one men 2554 up a little bit. Let me see. Yeah, three tens of a point. We'll be due. Oh, I know

[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.860]
I don't I don't let me see if I can get that morning number. Woo

[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.720]
Will you the don't start keeping the thing. It's not fun

[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.120]
It's not fun when you do like that

[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.380]
It's fun for me

[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.660]
You don't look at him. You never look at him. All of a sudden. Oh look at that

[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.500]
Men 2554 we got a 3.3 and across the street. They got a 2.1

[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.120]
They went down to 10th. We went up to you tens, but you know what? Hock Marx is a year. We are two

[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.500]
These are old people

[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.340]
Oh

[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.700]
10 past 10 at 560 WQM Niels. Yeah, kid baby

[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.180]
We're always

[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:31.600]
Hey

[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.960]
Hey, hot Mark, let me tell you what you guys got you guys got squat and I probably the afternoon leave the number

[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.580]
But I don't know I haven't got that far yet

[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.900]
Boy, what a shame, you know, yeah, we're just gonna miss out on a little bit of bonus money

[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.180]
Looks like that necessarily what do you mean?

[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.460]
Mike get three

[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.920]
Well, we got a 5.8. We're number four. We went from a 3.9 in the fall to a 5.8

[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:01.200]
Number four IODs at a 6.5, but that's 10 to 3 and of course we're on 10 to 2 right so when you take those grow test 2 to 4 hours

[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:01.520]
I mean

[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.680]
Yeah, we're gonna have a 6.0 something now that's the biggest number we've had in a long time

[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.380]
And you know something no, I'm gonna say it again, and you're gonna give me crap

[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.340]
This is on the heels of my getting rid of I'm your friend

[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.640]
I'm your friend they were destroying the show and then I was kind of sitting back and letting them do it

[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.440]
And of course Joe Bell sat back and then joy watching him do it. I guess I'm not gonna give you any crap

[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:27.060]
Do we have to have the conversation again? No, let me say it again the email format works just fine

[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:33.660]
We don't need stupid phone calls. I never said you need stupid phone calls. How much smartphone calls? Okay?

[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.140]
No, we don't need those either. Well, there aren't any

[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.360]
Well, maybe two or three a year

[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.340]
Let's see how the three to seven out. This is pretty good for us more. Yeah, we did great

[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.060]
We did great. We're a little bit speaking. Nothing it matters of course. What I said not that it matters of course

[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.420]
Other than what it does matter to anybody inside the building

[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.740]
Well to them, okay

[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.460]
You're fired George. Oh, I know. Oh, I know

[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:03.140]
See that's my ideas. We're just gonna keep showing up every day no matter what they say we just keep showing up

[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:14.920]
That's my plan. I'm not gonna show up tomorrow because I've got the day off. Oh, how come Niels got so many days out because he wants to that's why

[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:21.580]
Because he's got a life. He's got stuff going on. Okay, let's take a look at three to seven or seven to midnight must be really good

[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.240]
Let's see seven to midnight men 25 to 54

[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:34.120]
I'm looking at the first two pages. I don't see us or across the street and they've got the Marlins

[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.020]
Although there's no Marlins January February and March at the top of the third

[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.400]
On the top of the church for seven to midnight. Yeah

[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:48.120]
I thought I was the bottom of the fourth the bases loaded into out. Oh, actually he's got a 2.3 at night. That's up from a point eight

[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.940]
Hey, we're making some big moves at night

[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.480]
And where are we? Oh

[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.860]
My god, woo

[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.440]
Never in my life

[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.860]
Holy moly rat man save the juice shut off that transmitter

[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.720]
Seven to midnight Monday through Friday WQM has now tied for 26th

[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:15.220]
With a 0.3 seven to midnight a zero point three. Let me say it again. Oh, I

[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.720]
Don't want to say that could be the weak link his nights, but holy moly

[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.800]
Of course nobody can hear it at night and then we got that seven to eight tune out

[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.460]
Now can I go back and see how well we did in the afternoon three to seven? I haven't checked that out yet

[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.300]
He's a little bastard did let's see

[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:41.720]
He continues dropping like a rock from a 4.5 in a fall book to that was he was number four and that was that was a you know a wire diary book

[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.420]
Which we all get him

[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:50.960]
To tied for 12 with a 3.2 boy how the mighty have fallen and managed went from a 22 to a 2.8

[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.540]
So still not great, but not that far behind

[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.180]
In fact, I think you'll find four to seven. It's gonna be nip and tuck nose to nose

[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:05.120]
Because this 3 to 7 includes that I'm just 3 to 4 hour. I don't think 2 to 4 was too

[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:11.000]
Uh, spiffy although we'll find out in the next couple days when we get the hourlies won't we yes? Oh

[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:18.640]
Okay, now you're also sending me like weekends and stuff like that, aren't you? I had whatever they handed me a

[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.160]
Why did you why did you give me persons 2554?

[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.940]
Why do we want that from the book is that's how you get you know

[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.000]
You double the number no no, we've already got men you see when the book comes

[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.480]
Well, whatever got men 2554 you are just let me okay little boy law right whatever you say

[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:39.000]
Now we don't have to do that. Let me tell you what happened they handed me a stack of papers. I put them in the facts machine

[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.820]
Okay, don't put any more in there. Please please please

[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:48.000]
Let me tell you what happened. Yes, they handed me a stack of papers. I put them in the facts machine. I hit send

[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.260]
Who's they flee? Yeah

[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.740]
We don't want anything else okay men 2554 that's our target demo

[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:03.380]
Overall big is number one look at that and also we got to see how bubbled less bunch did if he I started to make an impact in the market

[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:12.520]
But I don't think so because big kicked big smelly ass. They went from time for fourth a 3.8 to a 6.3 number one big

[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.980]
How one of five is second CMQ FAM is turd the

[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:23.100]
The coast is for that just you know any guys 2554 listen to the coast no

[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.700]
All I can say is if you're a guy listen to the coast you ferry IOD

[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:35.720]
3.8 to a 4.7 in the morning. That's Jimmy civil or not so overall. Let's look in the mornings

[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.540]
Because I'm sure Jimmy is hanging on the edge of his thing

[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.840]
Big in the morning number one. They went up to an 8.2 share boy did they kick big smelly ass

[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.300]
Wow, but it loves bunch my ass. What station is he on what are the colors? I don't know W.O.F. F. Yeah

[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:59.840]
Hot 105 number two in the morning with a 5.7 big went from a 5.7 in the fall to an 8.2 from 3rd to 1st in the morning

[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.980]
Ancient Paul and old Ron

[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.100]
Radio Ritmo is third

[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:11.460]
Dropping as they should IOD went from a 3.4 to a 4.1 your number four in the morning Jimmy your number four

[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:17.620]
He's got a 4.1 and what we got a 5.8 we got a 6.1. 10 to 2. Oh make it a psychic guess. Yes

[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.440]
6.7 when we get to you at 10 to 2. No way you're crazy

[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.240]
That's my psychic guess there you go

[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.600]
6.7. That's like almost a full point. Yes, almost a full point. That's right

[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.520]
That means we would have like a 1 in the 2 to 3 hour

[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:39.440]
That's right. Well, I'll tell you let me do a little math. This is not interesting, but I'll do it anyway 5.8 times 5

[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:40.460]
40

[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:49.180]
29 okay, there's 29 points in there so if he had a 1 that leaves a 28 divided by 4 would be a 7 share so it's as you're right. It's possible

[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:56.560]
Possibly I got to guess something that's what I'm guessing. Okay. I'm not guessing. I hope I know I'm wishing and hoping and

[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.480]
Of course if we had a 7 that would be good enough almost for number one. Oh

[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:07.200]
Now what am I looking at I don't want to look at that nighttime number again. There's 0.3

[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:14.480]
You know the state. I'm in the morning Joe went from a 2.6 to a 3.4 nice going little dog and

[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:22.860]
Just kicked their ass boy. They got rid of Sid the kid just in the nicotine and anybody that's dreaming about putting that loser on here has to be a crazy person

[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.440]
joebell

[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:31.320]
Waxie in the morning went from a 1.7 in the fall embarrassing enough to a 1.4 in the winter book. That's all Sid the kid

[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.000]
Because he was on he certainly was on January, February and March

[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.080]
Right right

[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:45.100]
It's only been about what three four weeks. It's only been April at the what Steve White's been to fill in look at what in the morning

[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.620]
What scare America did from a 1.4 to a 0.7 wow

[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.680]
Talk about AM radio is dead now in mid days

[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.980]
What is it that I'm doing here? I don't know a little disorganized

[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.980]
mid days

[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:09.740]
CMQ F.A.N.A. was number one again with a 7.2 no speaking English I keep big was number two with a 6.9 wow a

[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.960]
Big book for big hello big

[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:20.260]
Now wait a minute we never did get to a bubble of love sponge. What's they since he on I don't know in the morning. I don't know

[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.680]
What do you mean you don't know you're supposed to be the the

[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.080]
Is it W.H.D.Rs at the one sure?

[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:30.860]
I

[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.820]
Have no idea I mean you look it up. I'm looking it up right here. You're looking what up?

[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.200]
Hey, well, I don't know they changed the call it is there's so many of these damn stations

[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.240]
I don't know what they are and even if I was sitting right there

[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.280]
I still wouldn't know what they are because I wouldn't really listening to them

[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.980]
HDR went from a 2.8 to a 3.0 so not really much of a factor there if that's the one I don't know

[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.360]
Yes, HDR. That's the one that bubbled loves bunches on yes

[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:58.420]
Looking sure he had a 3 and the Ron and Paul had an 8.2 who is they were number one who was number

[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.400]
14 so he ain't exactly cutting it yet

[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.820]
Maybe he'll kick in there keep looking my ass. I don't know. I don't think that's gonna work for you. W.H.D.R.

[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.980]
That's it. Yeah, not doing it

[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:19.860]
mid-day CMQ FM number one with a 7.2 big number 2 IOD number 3 with a 6.5 and then us with a 5.8 number 4

[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.600]
That's up from a 3.9 in a fall book and that's without the I'm your friend. I'm your friend

[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:31.360]
Oh, Nier, you got to take some calls. No, I'll take one call. They've Johnson 11 o'clock. Great

[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.640]
Now, let's see how do they do across the street midday against us because we know they're really dangerous

[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:43.200]
Oh, they were tied for 14th with a 2.6 we had a 6 something from 10 to 2 they had a 2.6

[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.200]
But over here we believe we have a younger hip or audience. Yeah, you keep talking a big game over there Steve white

[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.340]
You haven't got squat

[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:57.780]
See, let me tell you this about ratings and I've said it many times before the system is flawed at best everybody knows that but right one book one trend

[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.240]
meaningless usually meaningless

[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:08.000]
But over a period of time ratings mean something over a sustained period of time over months and years. Okay using that word consistency

[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:14.240]
No, that's just it's just the point is that you can't they can't be that wrong all the time in other words if

[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.180]
You continue to have a big number month after month year after year that means you got a lot of people listening

[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:25.860]
And if you continue to fail like them month after month year after year except in the afternoon with a number by the way is dropped dramatically dramatically

[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:33.020]
You ain't doing squat so they can't have all the meetings they want sit around to talk about how many hits they get how many votes

[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.480]
They get on the pole and all this other horse crap all this elephant turd

[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.760]
They're losing it. They're not doing it

[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.160]
3 to 7 p.m hot 105 number one with an 8.0

[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:51.380]
Big boy big just I don't know these big numbers as they all to me. There's an aroma

[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:57.340]
They went from a 2.8 in the afternoon from 12th in the fall book to 5.8 second in the winner book. I don't know

[00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.060]
You see what I'm saying? Yeah

[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.280]
IOD

[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:07.720]
This is the Schmidtmeister he went from a 4.1 to a 5.4 from seventh to third. He's third

[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:15.000]
CMQ FM radio ritmo and I'll see how our guys I already did this didn't I? Yeah, LeBanstead's got a

[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:22.640]
Something the three two and we got a 2.8 and that's 3 to 7. I bet you're 4 to 7 we might actually edge him out

[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.840]
Because 3 to 4 I can only imagine what that number might be and we'll get those hourlies

[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:33.640]
We'll get those hourlies maybe tomorrow when you'll be here. Mm-hmm. You're gonna post you around with them or what?

[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.600]
Maybe I'll make mention and then let you go over them when you get here on Monday

[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.820]
With a fine tooth comb that's right now that's that's another

[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.500]
Well, that's what you expect me to understand where they came from. How many times you've ever looked for anything gone

[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.800]
Gone over the sofa with a fine tooth comb

[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.020]
Just a small thick tooth comb

[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.600]
Were you grudge back?

[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:03.620]
If you see a petri dish sitting out in the lab, but there's a pretty good trick

[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:04.800]
Damn

[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:19.200]
I got me a tumor. It's as big as a whale and they say that they can fix it with some stem cells

[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:26.600]
Right now. I'm light-headed. I feel kind of funny. So hurry up and get that funding money

[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.100]
Oh

[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:48.140]
Yeah

[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:56.620]
and

[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.700]
These and

[00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.040]
Think

[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:08.240]
and a dice and hacking and a whack and saving in your freezer you can be an old geaser

[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:15.700]
my illness is tragic but stem cells are magic so everybody pass them around

[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.720]
and around and around and around

[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:24.740]
stem cells baby stem cells stem cells baby stem cells

[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.840]
the bell is up 101 points I told you this is gonna be a really um

[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.060]
bad day and I'm 10 to that right I set you some numbers even though you didn't

[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:35.440]
want anymore because we came in just to show me these uh... many of the 34

[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.500]
yeah I thought that you should see because we only have an old audience you

[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.200]
know so yeah well that's what I was just gonna point out I don't need I don't

[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.200]
need to be a drag down the tracks you know I'm tied to the back of the train

[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:52.040]
just calm down we went from a 1.6 in many 18 to 34 10 to 3 to a 5.3 we're

[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:57.900]
number four and that's 10 to 3 right about a 6 in many 18 to 34 and what are

[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.660]
they got across the street where they have the younger demographics let's see

[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:05.160]
miss adano she's got a 1.9 dropping from a 2.9 dropping from tied for 11 to

[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.540]
tied for 17 wow oh but we have a much younger and hip-a-radiant blah blah

[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.740]
yeah keep saying it somebody might believe it someday I doubt it but keep

[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:18.580]
saying it keep trying well that's the biggest number we've had in 18 to 34

[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.760]
so we actually have a bunch of living and breathing people out there how do

[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:28.420]
you like that yeah and look at the time spent listening wow talk about

[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:34.460]
wire diary I mean talk about loyalty right 14 hours and 45 minutes a week nice

[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.980]
whoever heard of a time spent listening like that and that's not even number

[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.560]
one that's number two who's number one what ethnic station is number one

[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.720]
each time you're listening oh I was there I think you're for nothing don't

[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.880]
blame me I'm just mumbling W Y and Z 25 hours a week and they still had a 1.4

[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:58.460]
because their queue was 1100 people oh no but they listened 25 hours a week

[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:02.980]
do you believe that or not they listened did oh did oh did oh five hours all

[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.920]
five hours every day Monday through Friday they got a whole bunch of wire

[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:15.700]
diaries or at least a few and it wasn't enough to do anything well they dropped

[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.320]
and I hate to say this because I do watch msnbc a lot but the reason that

[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.880]
they're failing most of the day besides Oberman is they all they want to do

[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.600]
is just be left wing politics they just want to continue I mean I'm not in a

[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.940]
panic about this wine flu but I'm I'm curious about what's going on plus I

[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.880]
have to do the show and talk about it a little bit and so yesterday I was

[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.200]
trying desperately to find something out about what the hell was going on and I

[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.460]
turn over to msnbc and they're still doing this Obama 100 days crap yeah and

[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.660]
doing Chris Matthews talking out of the side of his mouth and drooling and his

[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:53.140]
left wing politics you know if you if you people want somebody to watch it

[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.380]
put something on if people are concerned about that they care about yeah it was

[00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:02.120]
great before the election guess what the elections over now and after the

[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.700]
first 100 days let me say tell you this you know it's inconclusive and he

[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:10.520]
sure is how ain't no FDR I'm not this pleased there are a couple of things I

[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.380]
disagree with them on but I'm not this pleased but at the same time he ain't

[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:19.400]
no magician he's no Roosevelt oh the hundred days for the beep but it

[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.060]
moved but about all these same talking heads that we saw at election time the

[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:33.280]
same losers the same oh my god so that's good 18 to 34 a number whoa very

[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.380]
that's funny I and Z had 25 hours time spent listening and still a 1.4 share

[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:43.040]
oh one listener that just that's right one is to listen every day all week and

[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.600]
maybe the one listener moved away or die or something like that a wisher had a

[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:54.540]
big big time spent listening there man yep but the Q almost doubled in that

[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:58.720]
demo mm-hmm so that's good we're making a little bit of progress now that we

[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.360]
got a rid of I'm your friend I'm your friend

[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.020]
see I went based on my own judgment and I I like the emails and I you know I feel

[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.700]
better about the way the show's been going last few months since I've been doing

[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.840]
that and evidently it must have some impact yeah and I'm sitting here thinking

[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.680]
during this last break that if we were still allowed to do the near Roger show

[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.920]
which we're not but if we were we still be doing eights and nines like we used to

[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.960]
maybe more than that maybe double digits like in the salad like in one of the

[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:30.460]
signal nobody can hear what what like in the salad days yeah the salad days like

[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:34.240]
pre-jow bell like we always used to do I don't see any email by the way from

[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.000]

[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.100]

[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.600]
lied about the rating number we actually remember one with a 45-year that's

[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:40.780]
right I wonder if they're gonna go on here and brag about their numbers and

[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.900]
they're always talking about oh well we got so many more and said the kid here's

[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:48.980]

it fails and it sucks they're gonna love it it's gonna continue to suck and

[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.520]
it's gonna fail big time

[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:44.740]
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[00:31:44.740 --> 00:32:14.720]
whatever like

[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.560]
Well I do have one email from somebody in the building it's from Steve Sloan way to go

[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.400]
and you'll congrats.

[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.080]
I got good guy Steve Sloan.

[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:38.460]
I got what?

[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.800]
I got a text from him in text.

[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:40.640]
Thank you Steve.

[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.500]
He cares enough to send his very best.

[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.920]
Duff and Steve and the flea.

[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.380]
I don't have anything from upper level management.

[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.920]
Of course, he's busy getting laid.

[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:51.640]
I'm getting married.

[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.720]
Jimmy Stifilitics says we're having a ratings party.

[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.620]
Number one rated AM morning show in the market.

[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.420]
We had the number two rated spoken word morning show AMORFM.

[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.580]
Spoken word.

[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.180]
I mean is that pathetic or whatever.

[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:12.680]
How about pigmies under the size of two feet tall vegan pigmies.

[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.200]
That was of 77.77.

[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.500]
How do you like that?

[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.080]
WBC.

[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.080]
I'm over my whatever kind of flu non spine who in flu.

[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.060]
I can speak.

[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.060]
The numbers are coming back.

[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.020]
Now I would say there's a message in this book.

[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.400]
And that is that we're on the way back on this show.

[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.640]
Don't mess with it.

[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:36.920]
OK.

[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.220]
Don't screw with it.

[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.100]
No, seriously, you're laughing.

[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.100]
But what have I always said?

[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.560]
If it isn't broken, fix it.

[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.320]
That's why it's that's the motto in this business.

[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.360]
Not just on this station.

[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.980]
Every station I've ever worked at.

[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.140]
If it isn't broken, fix it.

[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:51.680]
Ditto with it.

[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:52.600]
That's why that's funny.

[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.180]
That's why that's hysterical what you just said.

[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.420]
If it isn't broken, fix it.

[00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.440]
Mess with it.

[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.880]
Under almost impossible, implausible circumstances,

[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.300]
we're doing pretty damn well.

[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.740]
Don't ask me how.

[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.640]
And if we ever get that signal cleared up,

[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:08.460]
I got only nose.

[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.480]
If somebody can hear us, God only knows, as the beach boys

[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.520]
would say, what kind of number we might put in there.

[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.640]
And if they would only let us, you know,

[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.500]
like play certain sounds and say duty bag again or something

[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.420]
like that, then who knows what we might do

[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.160]
in those younger demos.

[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.540]
But oh no, Joyce says this.

[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:28.600]
And Joyce says that.

[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.720]
Joyce calls the shots.

[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.180]
And Joe hates us like poison and wants us to fail.

[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.200]
So I say, look to him.

[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.380]
That's my message to him in honor of our book.

[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.020]
And spider you, we did it.

[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.660]
Not because of you, not with your assistance,

[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.120]
but with your interference and attempt to destroy.

[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.900]
And you know what, but loves the love of a plug says,

[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.460]
this is the best show in the market.

[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.580]
Best spoken word show?

[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:53.860]
Spoken word, yeah.

[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.560]
Spoken word show.

[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.620]
Oh, that whoever that picked me,

[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.340]
syphilis is just a panic.

[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:02.880]
A real scream.

[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:03.560]
That was a great line.

[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.600]
How come we haven't heard from any of the fakers over there

[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.260]
since the book came out across the street?

[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.120]
How come Hawk Mark hasn't made a comeback?

[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.680]
I'm sure he's typing it now.

[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.100]
How come the fake Sid Rosenberg hasn't chimed in

[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.460]
with his 1.4 share?

[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:21.140]
Talk about loser, loser, and every aspect of the word.

[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.940]
If you can't be good, at least be consistent

[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:25.880]
and he lives up to that.

[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.720]
Mike Johnson has a gross story.

[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.160]
It then in line with our poll.

[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.100]
The grossest thing he ever had to do is I reviewed the choices

[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.940]
on the poll, he says, I'm torn as two items are in combo

[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:38.840]
of what I had to do.

[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.800]
During my past time working in the retail industry,

[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.040]
one of the duties after closing was to be cleaning

[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:45.940]
the public restroom.

[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.260]
As I enter the men's restroom,

[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:50.120]
a powerful stench filled the room.

[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.600]
Ooh, must be a whole bunch of smelly old chime on in here.

[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:55.740]
Worst in that.

[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.560]
As I slowly move toward the stall, I realize the most foul side

[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.500]
I can imagine a customer had evidently had a bad case

[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.460]
of diarrhea, had soared as underpants and decided

[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.440]
that not only was he going to deface the toilet bowl

[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.200]
and seat with his residue, he proceeded to take his set

[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.560]
underpants and wipe them on the tile wall in our restaurant.

[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.120]
What a classy guy.

[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.660]
I had to quickly leave and return with a high powered water

[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.940]
hose and nozzle to get said residue off the wall and clean it

[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:21.060]
up.

[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.140]
Clean it up, Joe.

[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:22.760]
Clean it up.

[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.400]
With that, I'm now haunted again and remind myself as to why

[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.500]
exited the retail industry very shortly after that.

[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:29.740]
Sorry, Mike.

[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.400]
Sorry, I had it that probably stained him for life, so to speak.

[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.880]
When you think there are certain experiences

[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.940]
that soar your existence for the rest of your life,

[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.600]
that would be one.

[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.280]
What kind of a maniac would take soiled underwear

[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.660]
and smear it on the tile wall?

[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.720]
Well, what kind of a sick twist?

[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:49.660]
I'm your friend.

[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.420]
Oh, like that.

[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:51.940]
Yeah.

[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.080]
There are a lot of crazy people out there.

[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.100]
And like you always say, crazy people are scary.

[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:56.680]
Yes, there.

[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.120]
Is that what you always say?

[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:58.500]
Always.

[00:36:58.940 --> 00:36:59.920]
You still here, by the way?

[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:00.700]
Oh, no, it's crazy.

[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:08.800]
Now, if we do have a 6, 7, or 6, 8, you do realize, yeah.

[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.300]
In fact, you know something rushes on noon to 3, right?

[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:11.820]
Yes.

[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.600]
So the 2 to 3 hour over there certainly

[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.320]
is going to be just demolish our 2 to 3 hour.

[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:18.820]
If you take their 2 to 3 hour, we might actually

[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:19.660]
get that third money.

[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.600]
We need a 6, 6.

[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.640]
Well, they had a 6, 5 with their 10 to 3,

[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:27.860]
assuming they're the two to 3 hour

[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.200]
of rush, which I'm sure is a big hour.

[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:29.560]
Right.

[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.240]
So they might have like about a 6, 1, 6, 2.

[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:34.480]
Right.

[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.340]
We got a shot at the minor.

[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.820]
I mean, it's not enough to even talk about.

[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:38.940]
Not enough to fill a cup.

[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.600]
But nevertheless, in my life it is.

[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.660]
I would just like to get it just out of spite.

[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.680]
All this ranker and hostility.

[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.740]
And you know, this business about me going on here

[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.140]
and ripping them and asking, that's because they do these things.

[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.720]
I'm not the one who said fire, George.

[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.940]
I'm not the one who keeps trying to interfere with the show.

[00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.960]
I'm not the one who continues taking away airbie.

[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.240]
I mean, this new deal of mine here and granted.

[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.000]
Yeah, I was still making what most people would kiss their

[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.040]
my ass for.

[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.840]
But to take away all the other perks to everything.

[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:11.920]
I mean, you name it.

[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.360]
Whatever, even like free toilet paper, they took that away.

[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.380]
And you know what they can wipe their ass with it.

[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.200]
They're collective ass.

[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.380]
Harry and Sally Al's beach.

[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.460]
Remember, hold Harry and S.I.B.?

[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:23.700]
Yep.

[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:23.920]

[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.320]
Says, good morning, Neil.

[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.220]
I was listening to the big O-show yesterday at 2.30.

[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:27.820]
Oh, you're the one.

[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.480]
After you went off the ear and he said he had, oh,

[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:31.720]
and he had Ira win bag on.

[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.760]
Ira apologized to Big O because the day before he'd been on

[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.080]
two or three other WQM jocks shows and not on his.

[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.640]
At the end of Ira's appearance, he said he would be

[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.760]
on the near Roger show today.

[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:42.740]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:43.460]
Congratulations.

[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:44.740]
What time is he coming on?

[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.480]
He's coming on the 12th of never, Harry.

[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.180]
He's coming on when hell freezes over,

[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.480]
when Moxibol's turned into parogies.

[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.440]
Good luck on the ratings today.

[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.920]
I hope you enjoy your end of the Big bonus numbers.

[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.840]
Well, we might be in the small bonus numbers.

[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.180]
And quite frankly, it's a hell of a comeback

[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.580]
on our hands and knees crawling back into the ballgame,

[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.700]
crawling back in.

[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.240]
After the butchery of last two and a half years,

[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.060]
the slicing and dicing, even Ron Popeel can't believe it.

[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:13.740]
That's what he told me.

[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.480]
Dave Johnson's going to be calling in a few minutes

[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.060]
at 11 o'clock.

[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.120]
I can't believe I got that phone mounted around

[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.060]
for the first time in months.

[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:24.180]
I told you the phone aspect of this show basically,

[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.040]
except when you're on, you take as many as you want.

[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.000]
But other than that, it's over for me.

[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.640]
Finished, finito, finito, finito, finito.

[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:32.740]
Maybe they can help.

[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.060]
I don't want to.

[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.380]
I'm your friend.

[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.500]
Hi, Ron.

[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.800]
I mean, this is one of the most incredibly untold

[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.520]
scandals in the history of the broadcast business,

[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.420]
is that this company with all their resources

[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.960]
and with Joe's private detective and all the other crap

[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.420]
they talk about, wouldn't lift a finger,

[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.480]
not even the middle finger to do anything about that.

[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.060]
And I think they were enjoying it.

[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.120]
I think that I think that I tell you right now

[00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.860]
from the chair where my ass is sitting.

[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:04.660]
I am positive that they would see that what they want to do,

[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:05.860]
they don't really want to get rid of you,

[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.040]
but they want to try to get rid of you

[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.000]
as a way of getting rid of me.

[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:08.580]
Yeah.

[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.460]
They're trying to piss me off enough that I'll take a walk.

[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.340]
Well, I walk around a lot of woodbind.

[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:13.820]
I'll tell you that.

[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:14.880]
That's the only walk I do.

[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.200]
I walk all around downtown.

[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.560]
I walk at woodbind to the tea room and back to my machine.

[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:20.560]
That's it.

[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.000]
Because that's where they're going to save significant money.

[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.740]
They can put some lunch here.

[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.380]
They can put the kid on here at midday

[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.620]
and pay him 100 grand a year.

[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.280]
They could put Mo on here at midday.

[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.640]
He'll do it for like 50 grand.

[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.940]
He'll do it for sandwiches.

[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.440]
He'll do it for some stale pizza.

[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:42.580]
All for me.

[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:47.020]
CJ and dear field, who evidently is far, far behind the times.

[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.860]
Email says Neil and George,

[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.920]
please tell me you saw South Park last night.

[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:52.400]
Re-run?

[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.140]
Yes.

[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.860]
It is by far the best episode I've seen in a long time.

[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:57.720]
Dealing with the Jonas Brothers,

[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.020]
Mickey kicking the crap out of Zach

[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.620]
and the craziness the boys get into.

[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:02.600]
Been there, done that, seen it.

[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.540]
And it wasn't as good as it was touted to be.

[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.380]
It was good, but it wasn't about the Jonas Brothers.

[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.480]
It was about BJs.

[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.920]
Well, I hope to tell George and Neil,

[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.760]
George did if Neil didn't see the episode,

[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.020]
then you should get a copy to him.

[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.220]
We both saw it.

[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.760]
Got a copy, seen it, and they're done that.

[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.180]
It was good.

[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.120]
Great. No, I wouldn't say it was great.

[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.720]
It was better than deadbolt, but then again,

[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:26.380]
that was up 97.

[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.620]
It's a little spastic today.

[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:28.880]
And I noticed that they're not.

[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.520]
Chrysler bankruptcy looms.

[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.120]
Fiat would provide more fuel-efficient cars.

[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.060]
They're merging with Fiat.

[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.060]
Now, does Fiat make like,

[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.060]
I should know this, those little cars

[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.420]
that they'd drive in Italy, beside the Vespas?

[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:44.620]
I don't know.

[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.880]
Oh my God, here's one about the septic tanks.

[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:51.080]
What about them?

[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.620]
Well, I don't know.

[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.060]
Here's a long time listener who never got a book.

[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.320]
I don't want to read a whole bunch of gross things, you know?

[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.680]
I mean, the poll is about that,

[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.960]
but the one from Mike Johnson, I don't think he can top that.

[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.460]
Ricky says, how did the show do in the ratings?

[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:07.440]
I listened to 790 for a whole day in the car

[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.100]
with a friend, Tito called every show to say the same thing

[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.080]
to every host, even exchange.

[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.500]
I love you with the host opposite you.

[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.720]
Jorge Sado, he loves him.

[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:17.840]
Anyways, keep up the good work.

[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.020]
Let the guys across the street take the same four call

[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:20.760]
as it is, Ricky.

[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:21.480]
Thanks, Ricky.

[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.120]
We did great.

[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:22.980]
We did really good.

[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.800]
You know, you know something?

[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.700]
The fake Tom Jicke wants to know,

[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.240]
how did Manditz do against Le Bastard,

[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:31.260]
meant 2554?

[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.320]
I already read all those numbers.

[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.580]
And 18 to 34, we're not going to do the whole day with that.

[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:36.020]
I don't know.

[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.720]
If you really were the real Tom Jicke,

[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.260]
you wouldn't have to be emailing me asking that.

[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:41.700]
I would you?

[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:42.040]
No.

[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.760]
Mark and Miami says, congratulations on the new numbers.

[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.520]
I laughed along with George when you said the management told

[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:54.120]
the management not to do anything to the show.

[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.980]
Gaudiati with the best ratings we had in a long time.

[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:02.180]
Clearly assigned for management that something must be done

[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.340]
immediately to screw something up.

[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.160]
Hope he gets some bonus money

[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:10.100]
before they do something that not your ratings back down.

[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:10.960]
Thanks, Mark and Miami.

[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.280]
I'm reading it off the thing, you know.

[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.180]
So Dave Johnson's going to be calling very soon.

[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.860]
This is the Neil Roger show.

[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:20.220]
Do it, do it, do it.

[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.520]
This is your brain.

[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:21.920]
What?

[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:24.460]
Any question?

[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.000]
OK, it's 11.01 at 5.16 WQAM.

[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.380]
And down the stretch day come, I can't believe it.

[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:30.080]
It's Dave Johnson.

[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:30.920]
He's still alive.

[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.580]
No, I'm here.

[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.520]
Me too.

[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.320]
Isn't that a good feeling?

[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.160]
They keep trying to kick us in the ass when we keep showing up.

[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.020]
We're still here, Neil.

[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.080]
That's the main thing.

[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:41.480]
Yet it's a bit of a deal.

[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.860]
We may be old, but at least we have staying power.

[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:44.820]
Yeah.

[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:45.840]
So how are you doing?

[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.820]
It's not going to Mexico soon, OK?

[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.200]
No, not anytime soon.

[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:49.900]
OK.

[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.540]
I wasn't going to go before the flu thing,

[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:52.480]
so forget about that.

[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.200]
I went to school down there for a year.

[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:54.760]
You did?

[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.400]
I did.

[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.520]
And you survived it?

[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:57.920]
Had a wonderful time.

[00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.060]
Learn how to speak Spanish.

[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.060]
I lived with a wonderful family down there.

[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.820]
But this is a long time ago.

[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:03.440]
Yeah.

[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.740]
But it was a great time in my life.

[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.060]
Well, we've all had great times in our life.

[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:08.840]
Oh, look at this.

[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.080]
Joe Bell, congratulations on the winner book.

[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.800]
Looking forward to signing that bonus check.

[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:13.020]
Ah!

[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:14.980]
Oh!

[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.840]
Oh, since last day on Waxie with Monday March 6th,

[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:19.800]
this is all rating stuff.

[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.760]
We finally had a little kiss here.

[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.520]
You know how this business has gone

[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.440]
the last couple of years.

[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.680]
You know, the only thing I do with radio now

[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.760]
is I do this little interview talk show with Bill Fiddling

[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.220]
on the video.

[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:31.900]
Yeah, I read about that.

[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.640]
On serious and XM satellite radio.

[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.680]
And we can't get any ratings because apparently,

[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.100]
you know, they don't give them out for satellite radio.

[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.360]
So I don't know how it works.

[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.240]
Neil, maybe you could.

[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.560]
As long as you're getting paid,

[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.720]
why do you care about getting ratings?

[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.540]
Just I would like to know how many people are listening.

[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.380]
I mean, how many people are listening to us right now?

[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.220]
You probably know that.

[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:52.780]
Oh, yeah.

[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:53.820]
Oh, 30, man.

[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:54.660]
Yeah, about 30.

[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.080]
I don't worry about it anymore.

[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.240]
After all these years, as long as the checks keep showing up,

[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.300]
there's all I care about.

[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.140]
Isn't that what it's about?

[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:02.060]
That's what it's about.

[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.140]
I read a lot while you're doing it, right?

[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.240]
I read that you were doing that little radio thing

[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.120]
on serious and I thought,

[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.780]
here's a guy that keeps saying he's retired,

[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.520]
but you just can't walk away from it, can you?

[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.640]
It's really fun though.

[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.340]
What it is on Saturday mornings is I talk to my friends

[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:17.380]
around the country and you know,

[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.100]
people like Larry Jones and Wayne Lucas

[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.180]
and then Fiddling and I've been friends for years.

[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:24.080]
So it's more fun than work.

[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:24.960]
We're good.

[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.220]
I wish I could say the same.

[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.560]
But it's only one day a week.

[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:28.820]
If you only worked one day a week,

[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:29.980]
it'd be fine for you too, right?

[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.540]
Oh, let's start that next week sounds good to me.

[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:35.820]
Then he will be got the Derby coming up on Saturday.

[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:36.820]
I'm not going to be here tomorrow.

[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:39.460]
That's why Dave was kind enough to cancel 15 appointments

[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.200]
and be on with us today, which I appreciate.

[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.300]
I wouldn't miss talking to you Derby with you.

[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.900]
Well, at any rate, I wish I knew something

[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.960]
about all the other horses besides I want revenge,

[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.380]
but I don't.

[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.260]
I mean, I do like...

[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:51.940]
They do like that.

[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.820]
The two horses I like scratch.

[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.220]
So you tell me about your horse,

[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.340]
because my two horses are in the barn.

[00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:58.300]
Really?

[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.020]
Yeah, I really loved Old Fashioned.

[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:04.280]
Went after he won the remson last year and Larry Jones.

[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.340]
And he looked like he was just a perfect horse

[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.800]
for the Derby and then he got a flap fracture,

[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:14.320]
which is something the Trojo and the sidelines

[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.360]
for a long time in the Arkansas Derby.

[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.660]
So he's not around.

[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:19.440]
And who is the other one?

[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.580]
The other one was a long shot.

[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.520]
Wind willy just scratched yesterday morning.

[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.260]
And he was going to be like 50 to one.

[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.760]
I thought he had a real chance to roar through the stretch.

[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.520]
But those were two of my top picks.

[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.460]
So I'm searching for a top pick right now.

[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.420]
Yeah, I should have gone with some long shot

[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:39.800]
because every year we do this.

[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:43.300]
And when you think you've got a horse that's really a superior

[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:44.920]
and going to really do something,

[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.940]
the race is so bizarre, especially with 20 horses,

[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.740]
it just doesn't usually work out.

[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.720]
Anyway, I saw the wood memorial with I Want Revenge.

[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.560]
And that was truly a remarkable win.

[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.740]
I mean, that race was just spectacular.

[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.220]
He came out of the gate on his hands and knees practically

[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.000]
and spotted the field a few lengths.

[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.880]
And then just Joe Talamo made a great ride in that race

[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.360]
and weaved his way through the field

[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.780]
and just pulled away one by open lengths.

[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.040]
But you know, Neil, sometimes, you know,

[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.340]
when horses hesitate at the start and they get left,

[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.220]
sometimes they do it more than just once.

[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.360]
So that's another thing that you've got to look for on Saturday.

[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:22.920]
And if you're betting the horse, I hope he doesn't

[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.220]
hesitate the Saturday.

[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.240]
What are you trying to say?

[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:29.280]
I mean, if they do it once they can do it again.

[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:29.820]
Yeah.

[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:31.780]
There's something wrong there.

[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.480]
I mean, he's helping if they either way through the field

[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.600]
and when by open lengths they could do that again too, right?

[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:36.960]
He could.

[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.180]
He absolutely could.

[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.900]
If there's probably that horse and all done

[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.580]
Kirk is the horse that he showed me a lot.

[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:45.120]
Did you see his races down in Florida?

[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:45.920]
No.

[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.460]
Oh, he was really very, very good.

[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:53.420]
This is a, this is a, a very super, this is a super horse.

[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.860]
He might win the breeder's cup at the end of the year.

[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.220]
Whether he's got enough seasoning to win the Derby Saturday

[00:47:58.220 --> 00:47:59.140]
is another question.

[00:47:59.300 --> 00:47:59.660]
But he is.

[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:00.380]
Is that your pick?

[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:01.600]
I guess.

[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:02.340]
Well, you know what?

[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.920]
Nobody remembers you if you pick one of the favorites.

[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:09.280]
I, you know, how about something like Regal Ransom?

[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.820]
He'll be 30, 40 to one.

[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:11.560]
I mean, you know, if I don't...

[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.900]
He's 31 in the morning line.

[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:13.940]
OK.

[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.320]
So, you know, if I mean, I really like done Kirk

[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:20.060]
and I like, I want revenge, but just for our purposes,

[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.760]
you know, if I want to take a long set,

[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.120]
I'll take Regal Ransom.

[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.280]
Maybe he'll jump out and never look back.

[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:27.060]
OK.

[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.340]
I see his trainer is Saeed Bin Surur.

[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:30.620]
Easy for you to say.

[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:31.280]
Yeah.

[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.580]
That's an interesting, well, good pick.

[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.340]
Anyway, I'm going with I want revenge

[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.960]
and I hate to keep going with the favorite.

[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.200]
But, and let me just ask you this,

[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.520]
because we haven't talked in a long time.

[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.980]
What, what did you think about Big Brown

[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.140]
and what happened there in the Belmont?

[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.940]
What, what, what do you think was the cause for that?

[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.300]
I think the reason he lost the Belmont

[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.560]
is because it's tough for a horse to win the triple crown

[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.720]
after winning the derby and the preclose.

[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.660]
In fact, he didn't just lose the race.

[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:58.340]
I mean, he just fell out of contention and got pulled up.

[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.900]
But, but, Neil, the derby and preclose,

[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.920]
two weeks apart, shipping from one track

[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.040]
to another, different distances, different surfaces,

[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.460]
it takes something out of a horse.

[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.120]
That's why there's only been 11 horses

[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.620]
in the history of the world that have won the triple crown.

[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:12.900]
That's, I didn't like him in the,

[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.500]
and I didn't pick the winner,

[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.900]
but I didn't like him to win the, the triple crown.

[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.140]
I, it's just too tough.

[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.500]
And then he had a foot problem that we,

[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:22.680]
who knows what, and then they stopped on the steroids.

[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.780]
You know, I don't understand that part of the game,

[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.320]
but I, but I do understand that it takes a hell of a lot

[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.300]
to win the triple crown.

[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:31.680]
And, you know, I, I hope we get to see it

[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:32.980]
to the awards in our lifetime.

[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.040]
In our lifetime, yeah.

[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:35.740]
We keep talking about this every year.

[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:37.280]
This is gonna be the year with a big,

[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:40.060]
the smarty Jones and this one and that one

[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:41.580]
and Big Brown and just doesn't happen.

[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:42.100]
Charismatic.

[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:42.900]
Look at that.

[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:46.340]
He was just a few yards from the finish line

[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:49.200]
when he, when he broke down and Chris Antley ended up

[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:49.340]
in the team.

[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.480]
That was sad.

[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:51.240]
That was pathetic.

[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.100]
Yeah, I mean, this and, and then who was the other victory

[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:56.920]
gallop beat the, beat the other horse on the wire,

[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:57.960]
real quiet.

[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.480]
I mean, it's very tough to win the triple crown.

[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:03.360]
I wasn't surprised when Big Brown didn't win.

[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.540]
I was surprised when Kent the swirmer pulled him up,

[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.900]
but, you know, I, if a horse is going bad,

[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.620]
I don't want to jockey to beat him up.

[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:10.720]
Yeah, to have used him, yeah.

[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.660]
No, you know what that?

[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.800]
Yeah, well, when they came in the last turn,

[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.180]
he was just backing through the field.

[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.180]
I mean, I was shocked.

[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.860]
I just couldn't believe that he didn't run

[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:18.580]
a lick in that race.

[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.300]
He just backed up and that was it.

[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.720]
But you know, go with the pioneer of the Nile

[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.100]
with Gary Gomez for a second.

[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:28.540]
You know, Bob Baffer, it really, he knows he's won

[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:29.400]
the Derby three times.

[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.120]
He knows how to win the Kentucky Derby

[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.200]
and how you win it is, you bring your horse up.

[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.780]
You don't run the best race before May the,

[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.760]
the third, you run it on the first Saturday in May.

[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.520]
That's how come Baffer can win.

[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.620]
Is he the best is yet to come with this horse

[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:46.320]
pioneer of the Nile.

[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.100]
And who are you going to pick to team up with Regal Ransom?

[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.300]
Oh, okay, I'll take your, I'll take a,

[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.760]
I'll take pioneer of the Nile

[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.420]
and I want revenge and, and done Kirk.

[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.320]
I'm going to take those four horses in a try box.

[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.200]
Is that all right with you?

[00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.160]
That's okay with me.

[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.420]
Hey, you know, one thing though,

[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:03.480]
this kid that's riding your horse,

[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.920]
Talimoy, I saw him down in New Orleans

[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:06.920]
a couple of years ago.

[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:07.360]
Yeah.

[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:10.960]
When he was 16 or 7th boy, the horses won for him.

[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.580]
They, they really do.

[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.240]
He's a very good jockey.

[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.500]
Yeah, that was a spectacular ride in the award.

[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.400]
That was just unbelievable.

[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.240]
Yeah, he didn't lose his cool at all, Betty.

[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.160]
No, yeah.

[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:23.060]
So, what, why don't we combine our horses

[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.180]
when we get a good ticket?

[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.480]
Maybe we get the Superfector.

[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.740]
The dime Superfector, of course,

[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:31.000]
you know how these are tough economic times we're in.

[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:32.260]
I love that.

[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.600]
Well, you can't bet the dime on the Superfect

[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.880]
and the Derby, now that's wrong.

[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.040]
They should let us bet a dime in the Derby.

[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.080]
I'm not going to ask you about Mike Patagony again

[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.720]
because you always say he's a very nice man.

[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.320]
He's a very nice man.

[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:47.380]
But I think the, the, the, the, the morning line

[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:48.660]
is just crap.

[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:49.700]
Really?

[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:53.860]
Oh, I mean, yeah, the people who make a morning line

[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:55.880]
know that you can't have a morning line like this.

[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.460]
You've got a three to one favor in a two,

[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.520]
and two four to one shot.

[00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:00.480]
Oh, come on, on 20 horse field, please.

[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:03.780]
Make a favorite, but make the favorite

[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.160]
about about four to one.

[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.100]
And the next horse is five, five and a half, six.

[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:08.780]
Yeah, I want revenge.

[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:09.880]
I'm going to be no three to one.

[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.760]
He's going to be maybe like six to five.

[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.460]
No, he won't be that low.

[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:14.300]
He won't.

[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.400]
I don't think it'd be that low.

[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:18.180]
But he'll be lower than he won't be six to five.

[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.160]
I'll make it better now.

[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:21.000]
What do you think he's going to be about two to one?

[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.900]
I'll say, I'll say, I'll say two, two and a half.

[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.820]
Yeah, he won't be able to go to Woodbine

[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:28.840]
and point my course on.

[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:30.540]
You're going to Mexico tomorrow, aren't you?

[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.520]
Yeah, I'm heading for Mexico tomorrow.

[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.260]
I'm heading for Cosmale for Spring Break.

[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.120]
Don't start sneezing now.

[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:41.940]
I'm not going to track tomorrow.

[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.660]
You know, the funniest part of the whole thing

[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.780]
is I, and not really funny, but I've just gotten over

[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:48.980]
in the last couple of days a really bad bout of regular flu.

[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:51.260]
That's wine flu, but just regular flu.

[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.260]
And coughing and hacking and can't talk and stuff like that.

[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.340]
And so, you know, I guess if I wanted to go into a big

[00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.840]
song to dance, I could pretend I had it

[00:52:58.840 --> 00:52:59.800]
and take a couple of months off.

[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:05.680]
What did you take to take that camel flu and resin all

[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.480]
or whatever the hell was it?

[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.180]
I took my time.

[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:08.080]
I didn't take anything.

[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.500]
I just took over the counter-crap.

[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:12.080]
You know, these things run their course when you get to visit.

[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:13.220]
Were you really sick though?

[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.980]
Well, I mean, I couldn't talk when you're doing this

[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.780]
for a living as you know, it's a little tough to talk.

[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:18.220]
How long?

[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.220]
Now, all the years that you called races,

[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.260]
did you ever have a day where you had like Lurin-Jitis

[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:23.620]
and you could just barely squeak it out?

[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:25.360]
Yeah, a couple of those.

[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:25.860]
Did you?

[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.640]
Yeah, but you know, I, uh, you know.

[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.520]
I didn't, I was never like crazy about going to,

[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:35.220]
I never did go to a doctor from my throat or any of that.

[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.060]
I don't eat lots or any of that.

[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.540]
Yeah, I just, I sold you through it

[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:44.000]
and I didn't take many days off for being sick either

[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.460]
because I ate a lot of times.

[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:46.380]
I didn't have a backup.

[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:49.120]
But, uh, no, I didn't take a lot of days off.

[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:50.640]
Well, you're a real trooper.

[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.380]
They kept that bourbon and that tequila.

[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.560]
You know, a tequila that you learn from in Mexico, right?

[00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:59.960]
That's how you, that's how you have to take care of the vocal cords.

[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.040]
Exactly. Right.

[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:04.320]
Okay, David's good here and from here and we'll talk again in two weeks.

[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:06.100]
Talk to you right before the preek.

[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:06.860]
It's good luck in the day.

[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:07.100]
You bet.

[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.420]
Same to you, Dave.

[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:08.740]
Bye.

[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:09.420]
Take care.

[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:13.040]
Okay, Dave Johnson, we've been talking to him every year for what?

[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:13.720]
About 100 years?

[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:14.260]
At least.

[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:16.420]
And I always enjoy it.

[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:17.080]
He's a great guy.

[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:17.980]
Yes he is.

[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.740]
12 minutes after 11 at 560 WQM and...

[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:21.460]
New Yorker.

[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:32.220]
Oh, my friends.

[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:33.720]
Go with me back.

[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.460]
Hey, bagging, they got that bagging.

[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:35.860]
Wow.

[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.120]
They keep that.

[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.540]
Those have to open wide.

[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:41.840]
Do you not talk with your mouth full?

[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:42.900]
You make me sick.

[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:43.620]
I'm not throwing up.

[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.680]
Well, I got to teabagging.

[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:49.880]
What is that in your mouth?

[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:57.400]
What is your mouth?

[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:01.000]
Teabagging is a ball of blood.

[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.860]
Certain things you never expect to come out of a person's mouth.

[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:08.100]
Teabagging lies onto our volas.

[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.760]
What can you ever just keep your big mouth shut?

[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.620]
Come keep my mouth shut because I'm a secure big mouth.

[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:21.820]
Teabagging lies onto our volas.

[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:24.080]
The next thing I remember is having my knees and my ears.

[00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:26.780]
Teabagging lies onto our volas.

[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:27.740]
I still have a tip.

[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:29.880]
Yes, I can do teabagging.

[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.220]
Oh my God.

[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:37.400]
I just, I don't have a good feeling about this.

[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:48.860]
I can't help but cry.

[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.560]
I can't help but cry.

[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000]
It's hard to talk to your feet.

[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:57.460]
Teabagging.

[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:05.460]
How about I sit on your kinky face while you think about that?

[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:13.140]
Take a little dip.

[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.840]
Shake around the bed.

[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.240]
Make them do a flip and squeeze.

[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:19.940]
Take a little dip.

[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:21.640]
Shake around the bed.

[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.260]
Make them do a flip and squeeze.

[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:29.020]
Shake around the bed.

[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.200]
Oh my God.

[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:36.960]
Let me take a look at that line up today.

[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.080]
We got the big O, two to four.

[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:40.700]
Mad Dog 4 to 7.

[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.160]
Hurricane Hotline 708.

[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:43.360]
Wow, those nighttime numbers.

[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:44.360]
Shocking.

[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:46.680]
Staggering.

[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.720]
A 0.3.

[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:50.480]
What's a record?

[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:52.580]
Is it for me?

[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.360]
I've never been on a station that had that kind of a number.

[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.840]
You never been on a station that 0.3.

[00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:59.880]
Don't you remember a couple of trends ago or a couple of maybe in the last book?

[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:00.220]
Yeah.

[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:02.660]
That's the only place you get the hourlies.

[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:03.100]
Right.

[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.560]
We had one hour with a point.

[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:05.240]
Oh, remember that?

[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:05.580]
Yep.

[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:07.860]
I was either the last book of the one before that.

[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.060]
We had one hour at night where we had a point.

[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:10.460]
Oh.

[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:11.540]
Meaning nobody was listening.

[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.620]
Meaning why to turn that dent thing off and save the juice?

[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:16.940]
Wow.

[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.820]
Here's one from my anal chapstick.

[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:20.520]
Oh, yeah.

[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:21.520]
Remember him?

[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:21.960]
Mm-hmm.

[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:22.380]
It?

[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:26.140]
I just wanted to say hello and let you know that I'm still listening to Spike Joe Bell's wishes.

[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:27.360]
Remember when you have an edge?

[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:28.120]
Scratch it.

[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.560]
That's what my anal chapstick.

[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:30.260]
Be saying.

[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:31.540]
The chapstick helps.

[00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:35.140]
And of course I got that email from Joe Bell breathless about that.

[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:36.960]
Congratulations me on the book.

[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.540]
Didn't say anything about you though, I don't know.

[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.800]
And also about Sid's last day was March 6.

[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:46.660]
I think he's trying to like, uh, try to make an excuse there for Sid.

[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.640]
Oh, well, Steve White was on the last part of that book.

[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.620]
You know what, Sid's still did squat.

[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:54.280]
He's still did one shares every trend, every book, one shares.

[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:59.060]
One shares with a big fat obnoxious New York mouth.

[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:06.060]
And if he puts him on from two to four, I mean, he's not going to do more than that here either.

[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:07.460]
He is what he is.

[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:12.260]
And the audience is revolted and disgusted by him just like to hit the ranges.

[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:12.720]
Ranges?

[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.780]
How the ranges do, by the way, they still plan?

[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:21.560]
Jim says greetings as far as I'm concerned you guys have the best sounds coming out of your mouth show on AM or FM.

[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:23.440]
The best talking sound.

[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:25.140]
What was spoken word yet?

[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.320]
That that's just phenomenal.

[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.520]
Congrats on the stellar book.

[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.400]
And little George's shows New Reffons continue to entertain.

[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:35.260]
And finally, the fake Jimmy gives me real diarrhea.

[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.100]
I'll go along with that.

[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.000]
They're having a big ratings party over there at IOD.

[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:43.260]
I don't know why, but they're having a big, you know, a big thing.

[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:46.440]
Keep channel.

[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:50.000]
And of course, they're probably compelling over that Ron and Paul book.

[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:50.560]
Can you imagine?

[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:51.440]
Oh, yeah.

[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.340]
And 8.2 congrats to them, by the way.

[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:54.820]
Nice going.

[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:55.440]
That's work gentlemen.

[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.800]
I have no idea how, but you did it.

[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:02.640]
And Bubba see that Tampa Yahoo Ron and Ron stuff.

[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.000]
It doesn't fly in this market.

[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:04.500]
It never has.

[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:05.360]
And I don't think it ever will.

[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.100]
Not that I've ever heard him.

[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:07.600]
Let me say it again.

[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:08.240]
I've never heard him.

[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:08.980]
I don't know the guy.

[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.400]
He mentions my name a lot, which you know, big deal.

[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.820]
What am I going to say about him?

[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:16.840]
I guess fire reports.

[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.000]
Most of which say that the show blows, but I don't know.

[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:21.860]
I'm not going to make any comment because I have never heard him.

[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:25.380]
The fact that he has Hulk Hogan on every five minutes.

[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:27.900]
That's like us having ever a windbag every five minutes.

[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:33.520]
Oh, here from the automated tele machine.

[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:36.400]
I'm going to get $80 billion from some of the guy just inherited.

[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:42.180]
Oh, my God.

[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:46.520]
Here's a guy who was a seamen specimen collector with a horse breed or no cala.

[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:47.280]
Wow.

[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.440]
Should we add that?

[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:51.760]
No.

[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:55.240]
A lot of people don't know that horse seamen also makes an excellent hair conditioner.

[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.700]
My wife used it every day.

[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.700]
It's loaded with protein.

[00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.780]
It says I used to put a little bit in my tea at night.

[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:02.000]
Oh, God.

[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:03.180]
Whoa.

[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.800]
Don't dine with Al.

[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.840]
I'll tell you that right now.

[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.500]
I'm just I'm just worn out.

[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.760]
So much stress so much pressure.

[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:18.680]
So Joe's getting ready to sign those bonus checks right now.

[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.800]
Although I think he just said that bonus check.

[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:21.880]
Let me look at the email again.

[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.360]
I think it was singular.

[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.160]
Let me look at it.

[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.920]
I wouldn't be surprised if he comes by, opens up the door and looks at you and says,

[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.700]
you still here?

[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:31.500]
Again.

[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:32.000]
Right.

[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.300]
Congratulations on the winner book numbers.

[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.620]
Looking forward to signing that bonus check singular.

[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:46.440]
By the way, Sid's last day on Waxie was Monday, March 6.

[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:48.260]
Sounds to me like kind of an excuse.

[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.320]
Like, oh, he really had like about a 10 share, but Steve White pulled a number down.

[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:53.060]
You know, in the last month.

[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.960]
He did ones consistently the whole time he was on that station.

[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:58.540]
One shares.

[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.520]
So Joe had a much better morning book with a 3.4 K.

[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.780]
Oh, and by the way, I got one.

[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:07.780]
Where is it?

[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.360]
Please, I'm just one.

[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.240]
He says I just want to say congrats to you and George.

[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.540]
Nice job not only in our key demo of men 25 54, but also men 18 to 34.

[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.460]
Keep up the great work.

[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:17.960]
Thanks, please.

[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.160]
Thank you.

[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.340]
Barry Jackass says, how are Davis claims 790?

[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:26.080]
The ticket outperformed WQM and every major day part in men 18 to 34.

[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:26.620]
Can you verify?

[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:27.800]
Well, let me just put it this way.

[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.240]
We kicked their ass.

[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:29.780]
We had a what?

[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.560]
A 5, 3 and they had a 1 9 and men 13 18 to 34 midday.

[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.560]
So if Howard Day, I mean, this is, you know, Barry Jackass.

[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:40.420]
Howard Davis is full of crap.

[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:42.340]
Like I said, they lie about the ratings over there.

[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:44.660]
They live in a fantasy world.

[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:46.500]
They live in a total fantasy world.

[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.620]
Oh, well, they don't really reflect this and only old people get, well,

[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.160]
if only old people get the diaries and fill them out, then how come we were so,

[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.900]
did such a good job in men 18 to 34?

[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.800]
Believe me, when you get to be my age 18 to 34, eight old.

[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.260]
What are you laughing about?

[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.580]
They're just young pups.

[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.000]
It is.

[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.840]
You get to be an old fart collecting social security, which I am.

[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.600]
Well, I never thought I would do that.

[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:13.160]
Really?

[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:17.500]
I don't know why I got to come and have been paying social security taxes for a hundred years.

[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:19.080]
Why shouldn't I collect what I got coming?

[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:19.800]
I hope to.

[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:20.820]
Can't wait to.

[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:22.040]
Soon.

[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:23.640]
Like tomorrow.

[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:24.740]
Yeah, it might happen.

[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.480]
Yeah, but then what's going to happen when you get to be old and gay?

[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:27.860]
Grey.

[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.100]
You're already gray.

[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:29.600]
Grey.

[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.160]
I'm already old.

[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:31.940]
No, you're not.

[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.560]
When you get to be my age and that you're going to need that money, man, that's social security.

[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:37.540]
That's going to keep you alive.

[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.580]
That's going to keep that cabinet in North Carolina going with heat.

[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.320]
Keep the kindling wood coming in.

[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:43.700]
All right.

[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.740]
Baron Fitz says congratulations on a solid book.

[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:51.640]
I'm a relatively new and young listener that has turned on a lot of my friends to your show.

[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.980]
Thank God for you, Baron.

[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.680]
I doubt that had direct impact on your ratings.

[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.300]
I doubt it too.

[01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:56.740]
Who knows?

[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:02.860]
Hopefully the next generation of us, Neil God converts, can get you back to double digits and ass-hat Joe Bell can suck on it.

[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.520]
How do you like that?

[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.320]
Can suck on the ass-hat?

[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:05.660]
Oh.

[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.580]
This is what he's talking about.

[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.480]
They don't like you, Joe.

[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.400]
And quite frankly.

[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.200]
Oh.

[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:19.840]
Oh, boy.

[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:24.960]
I bet you he was biting his tongue when he wrote that email so hard there was blood spurtin' all over the place.

[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:26.900]
You think?

[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:27.880]
I don't know.

[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.180]
Let me, during the break, look at it again and see it and make sure that he didn't mention you.

[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.660]
I got to look at the meal budget.

[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.800]
Well, here we go again.

[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:38.660]
Oh, don't tell me that's the rejoin.

[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.340]
That's the rejoin.

[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.060]
Don't rejoin.

[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.400]
Neil God.

[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.900]
Thank you for letting me speak on your show.

[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:58.740]
I have great respect for the United States of America, but I am convinced it is time for your federal government to recognize the true sovereignty of these people who are just trying to live and work in a free state.

[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.200]
They are not rebels.

[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.640]
They are patriots who simply want a country of their own.

[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.040]
Yes?

[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:06.580]
Wow.

[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.200]
Oh, no.

[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:09.740]
We've come up with a lot of narrative.

[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:10.940]
What does it say it on there?

[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:11.900]
Not at all.

[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.640]
Much of idiots.

[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.780]
Somali talks about the sovereignty of Texas, Humbendredin Texas.

[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:17.180]
Okay.

[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.100]
Chop it off and give them to the Mexicans.

[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.040]
They deserve each other.

[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.620]
But you notice Governor of Texas right-wing nut job.

[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.460]
We want us to seed.

[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.120]
And Bob, Bob, Bob!

[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.760]
And as soon as they start getting a little swine fluke...

[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.120]
Oh, now finally they got the story on there.

[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:38.900]
Now, when you can watch it here live, right here in the sea in a newsroom.

[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:39.800]
What is he bouncing?

[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.300]
Is somebody like a scratch in his ass or something?

[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:43.540]
And why is that idiot bouncing?

[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.180]
He was bouncing.

[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:45.380]
Did you see him?

[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:45.720]
I did.

[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:48.740]
Bouncing up in the dollar, he had sent the virus

[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:50.880]
dancing his pants because he's got a nitchy ass.

[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.480]
Maybe he's got swine on flew.

[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.400]
I was just about to say that they must not want

[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.360]
to get everybody panicky, especially after they raised

[01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:59.720]
to level five yesterday.

[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:00.200]
Oh my god.

[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:03.700]
Because they haven't really been banging away

[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:04.760]
on the swine flew thing today.

[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.820]
So maybe we don't have any more dead people.

[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.460]
Do you think?

[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:09.740]
Obviously not.

[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:10.360]
What's the real number?

[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.280]
Is it seven or is it 152 in Mexico?

[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:15.660]
The World Health Organization says seven confirmed deaths

[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:16.720]
from swine flew in Mexico.

[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.160]
And they've been telling us every day

[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.140]
they, whoever they are, 152.

[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.140]
I mean, there's not much discrepancy between those numbers.

[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.400]
7 and 152.

[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:25.880]
Well, average amount, like the ratings.

[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:28.780]
Well, wouldn't that be sweet if we

[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:30.100]
get a little rating of bonus in there?

[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:30.420]
Come over.

[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.040]
Oh, boy.

[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:33.360]
Couple of bucks.

[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.040]
Would be nice.

[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:35.920]
We can use it, Joe.

[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.120]
I just make the checks out now.

[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.580]
Maybe we can get number two.

[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.100]
I don't know.

[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.840]
Let me look at those again.

[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:45.720]
That's a little reachie.

[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.640]
By a sure hope-powered Davis, I don't

[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.780]
know how our Davis sees the GM over there across the street.

[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.900]
I sure hope Barry Jackass is full of crap.

[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:54.280]
Because if they're really lying about the number,

[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:55.740]
I mean, how can you lie about the numbers?

[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.800]
They're black and white.

[01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.080]
People do.

[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:00.460]
Big has got a 6, 9, 10 to 3.

[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:05.100]
And I would assume that 10 to 2 is probably the great.

[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:05.760]
Well, let's see.

[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:06.220]
What do they got?

[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:06.780]
3 to 7.

[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:07.500]
What's their number?

[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:09.180]
Big 5, 8.

[01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:10.280]
See what I'm saying?

[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:10.740]
Yeah.

[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.360]
So we're not going to beat them.

[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:12.740]
No.

[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.380]
So let's tip our head to big for the greatest number

[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:17.200]
of wired diaries.

[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.780]
We had some, but boy, they really.

[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.060]
Oh, and somebody asked me.

[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:26.340]
I got a thing here, an email from Jason and Weston.

[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.780]
I've been listening for years.

[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:30.060]
I still don't know what a wired diaries could you explain?

[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.480]
Sorry if it's a stupid question.

[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:32.520]
Not a stupid at all, Jimmy.

[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:34.220]
Jason, whatever your name is, Jason and Weston.

[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:37.320]
A wired diaries and arbitrarian diaries

[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.280]
supposed to write down what station you listen to

[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.360]
and what times and what days.

[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.900]
A wired diary is one where somebody just takes the same,

[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.500]
like that one for I and Z.

[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.420]
They take the same station and the same day part,

[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.120]
like mornings or mid days or afternoons.

[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:54.020]
And they just write down that they listen to all four hours

[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:57.160]
or five hours every day, with nobody listening like that.

[01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.600]
They just make it up because they're like voting.

[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:01.300]
It's like a popularity contest.

[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:02.940]
So they're voting for their favorite station

[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:03.960]
or favorite shore or whatever.

[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.980]
And we like those people, especially if they vote for us.

[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:08.820]
Right?

[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:09.400]
Right.

[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.420]
So Joe just came in and shook my hand.

[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:12.320]
I'm a little, he did not.

[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:13.380]
A little busy and stunned.

[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:15.620]
Now wait a minute.

[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.980]
You didn't tell me to strap myself in.

[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.640]
I always give you a warning.

[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:20.200]
I'm sorry.

[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.200]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.000]
I just get a warning.

[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.700]
He shook your hand and said, what?

[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:26.020]
Congratulations.

[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:29.400]
And I said, I'm still here.

[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:31.100]
And he said, so am I.

[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.780]
And that was it.

[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:34.360]
That was it.

[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.560]
There were some smiling going on.

[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:39.100]
I have chills.

[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.360]
I'm not talking about trying to do.

[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.960]
I have chills without the fever.

[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:44.580]
That's one good thing.

[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.220]
I didn't have the fever at all during my illness,

[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:47.080]
whatever the hell it was.

[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.960]
I think it was a side of infection.

[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:49.220]
Yeah.

[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:49.580]
A what?

[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:50.240]
Signs infection.

[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:52.760]
If it had been the flu, you would have at least some fever

[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.740]
at some point.

[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:55.800]
Fever and moan.

[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.760]
Like I said, a WS P B in Sarasota,

[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.780]
were you said that got Peter Johns to the morning show?

[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:03.800]
I didn't say it.

[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:06.460]
Lowell Schumacher, were used to call him the turkey buzzard.

[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:07.080]
I think he died.

[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.680]
Lowell Schumacher, he used to do one of the day parts.

[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.320]
Funny guy.

[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.760]
We used to call him the old turkey buzzard

[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.580]
because he looked like one.

[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:18.600]
Anyway, he would say promoting the Peter Johns show

[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.120]
in the morning, Peter in the morning, and fever all night.

[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.040]
He would say that.

[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.580]
Now, if he would say that back in 1973,

[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:29.340]
I guess 36 later, I should be able to say it.

[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.420]
36 years later, what did I just say?

[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.280]
Well, I'm stuck on a hall's mental lifto's.

[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.220]
Thank God I don't have any of that crud anymore.

[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:36.640]
I don't have to be drinking any tea,

[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.680]
running in the other room and making cups of hot,

[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:39.420]
chamomile tea.

[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.060]
Boy, that gets old.

[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:44.000]
But I've had that situation for years, man.

[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:46.040]
When I get a cold or a flu or whatever,

[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.540]
it settles in my throat, and I get all that flim

[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:49.880]
and mong the sinus infection,

[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.140]
and I do the squeaky and can't talk.

[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.620]
You know, I start hacking on a ear.

[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:56.200]
That, that, that, that, that.

[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:56.760]
Like that.

[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.240]
You just make that up so you can get time off.

[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:00.540]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:01.380]
I'm a slacker.

[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.060]
Joe Bell came in there and shook your hand.

[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:06.020]
That's a straight face.

[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:07.220]
Or do you just make that up?

[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:08.020]
Yep.

[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:08.960]
I made it up.

[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:09.760]
No, seriously.

[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:10.620]
I'm serious.

[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:12.240]
Why would I say something like that?

[01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:13.360]
I don't make things up.

[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:14.800]
And you shook his hand.

[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:15.940]
Yeah.

[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.040]
Did you squeeze it?

[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:18.920]
Warmly.

[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:20.360]
Did you give him a little finger on the palm?

[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.320]
No, nothing on the palm.

[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.660]
I would have had first, though.

[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:23.880]
He did what?

[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:25.280]
I licked my hand first, though.

[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:30.300]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:30.620]
woo.

[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.440]
And George has got back from Mexico.

[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:34.140]
That's right.

[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:35.360]
And I didn't wash.

[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.000]
You wouldn't go to Mexico if they paid your way there

[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:38.900]
and gave you five grand.

[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:39.940]
Oh, how much?

[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:40.440]
Five grand?

[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:41.000]
Pig my way?

[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:41.500]
Where?

[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:42.040]
Which part?

[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.180]
One of those nice parts?

[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.620]
Were they keep all the locals away?

[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:46.860]
Yeah, parts of I art.

[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:47.720]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:48.560]
I'd think about that.

[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.480]
Can Koon maybe?

[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:51.620]
I'll ask Paco if there are any nice parts in Mexico.

[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.100]
OK.

[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.160]
I'll guarantee he ain't no hurry to go there.

[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.020]
Oh, bet.

[01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.740]
L'Otango, I can't say the last name,

[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:01.800]
because somebody told me what it means.

[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:05.460]
L'Otango, Schmendrick, says WQM's management

[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:07.100]
is always complaining about George's market

[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:09.040]
here during the summer when he substitutes for you.

[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:10.060]
No, no, no.

[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:11.820]
Yeah, he's submarineed us again in the summer.

[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:13.980]
George always kicks ass in the summertime.

[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.540]
I don't know what their problem is with you.

[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:16.640]
I guess it must not be business.

[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.440]
It must be personal.

[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.460]
Well, I'm not part of the problem.

[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:19.380]
You might have money you're making.

[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.160]
I mean, that's not going to make any dent

[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.560]
in that they're not in the fraternity,

[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.800]
but they don't complain about the ratings because they can't.

[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:25.440]
They're always good.

[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:27.580]
It says now take a look at Kim Bo camper.

[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:28.240]
Oh, I can't.

[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:28.960]
I got a week's stomach.

[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.440]
He started in the two to four

[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.800]
as a substitute for Mohawar David

[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.760]
and then took over to slide when Howard resigned.

[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:37.980]
Bo camper's market share was, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong.

[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.320]
A zero point something.

[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:40.340]
I don't remember that.

[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:41.720]
I remember a one point something.

[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.140]
We've consistently Moe had a one and guilty had a one

[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:46.820]
and Bo camper's got one.

[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.860]
I'm told I don't want to see it.

[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.880]
What did WQM do for this dismal performance?

[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.360]
They gave Kim Bo camper the morning show,

[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:54.360]
which is prime time for Kim.

[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.880]
Yeah, the Kenyon blow morning show and boy, did it blow.

[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:00.420]
This morning show bombed out.

[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:02.440]
WQM had a higher weight Joe Ross from 790

[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.640]
because the ratings were so bad.

[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.040]
What does WQM do again?

[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.380]
They gave Kim Bo camper the seven to eighth to dolphin hour.

[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.640]
I believe you said the current rating for 7 to 8 PM

[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.520]
are zero point three.

[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.540]
Now, it'll be really great when we get the hourlies

[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:14.280]
because if we have a zero point three

[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.060]
from seven to midnight,

[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.600]
we've certainly got some hours in there

[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.800]
that might have a point.

[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:18.660]
Oh, you know,

[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.480]
I mean, you know, what what is the total point three times five

[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.780]
is a one point five.

[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.680]
That's the total the total numbers for those five hours.

[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.140]
Oh, zero point three.

[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.820]
Maybe if we talk louder at night, can you hear us now?

[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:38.680]
How's it sound?

[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:41.900]
Maybe they're not a spoken word show under in that time.

[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:44.820]
Maybe they should start speaking.

[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:46.040]
It says why the double standard,

[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.240]
why does WQM on a fire George when his ratings are better

[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:48.980]
than Kim Bo camper?

[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:52.580]
Is it because Kim Bo camper is a joke and white and George is Cuban?

[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:53.200]
Yes.

[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.360]
He keeps spelling your name with a G by the way.

[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.400]
Sorry, he knows your Cuban.

[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.700]
There ain't no George with a G in Cuban.

[01:11:58.940 --> 01:11:59.680]
Is there no?

[01:11:59.820 --> 01:11:59.920]
No.

[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.780]
Are all George's Jorge C?

[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.640]
Shame on you, Joe.

[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:06.800]
Well, you're such an evil person.

[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.000]
Says you're truly a lot of anger.

[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:08.720]
I can't say it.

[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.220]
I won't say I could say it, but I know.

[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:12.520]
I said it the one time I didn't know what it meant.

[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.120]
When you don't know what it means,

[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.220]
but you didn't.

[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:18.140]
Maybe I did.

[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.060]
What a bonehead.

[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.700]
Paul says congrats on the numbers management still sucks though.

[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:23.740]
Keep on kicking ass.

[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.380]
I hope they don't submit canned George.

[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:26.060]
Thanks for the entertainment.

[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:26.740]
Thanks Paul.

[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.740]
Now we're not going to let him submit canned George.

[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.580]
Like I said, there are no problems on this show

[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.420]
other than the fact they won't give us any lead way

[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:35.480]
to do the real show and it won't give us any support.

[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:37.560]
And now what they're going to say is,

[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:38.920]
well, if he can get a six something share

[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.440]
with a doing the crap show that we're allowing him to do now,

[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:43.500]
then that's good enough.

[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:44.180]
No more complaints.

[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:45.920]
And why do they come up with this crap

[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:48.400]
about how we're so difficult to deal with me and Norma

[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.920]
and you, well, what does that mean?

[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:50.460]
I don't know.

[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.160]
What is it that we're demanding or asking for?

[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:52.840]
Sounds me up.

[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:54.120]
You were hoping that we'd trade you a car

[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.220]
and they said, sure, no problem.

[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:56.300]
And they didn't do the first thing.

[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.460]
I wasn't hoping it wasn't my idea.

[01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:59.960]
I wasn't the one that suggested it.

[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:00.860]
Who suggested it?

[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:01.180]
Joe.

[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.240]
He suggested it.

[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.500]
When we were talking about my contract.

[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:10.520]
And he suggested that they were going to trade you a car

[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.900]
that they would do, see what they could do

[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.080]
about getting a car.

[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.120]
They saw what they could do.

[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:15.960]
They saw what they could do too.

[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:16.480]
See, yeah.

[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:20.280]
The whole world saw what they can do.

[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.380]
Zip, but he do does.

[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:24.300]
Zip, but he gay.

[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:26.620]
Gate.

[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.540]
It's almost noon already.

[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:31.100]
Been a fabulous day.

[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:32.180]
We had Dave Johnson on here.

[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:32.800]
He sounded good.

[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:33.540]
Yes, he did.

[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:35.160]
Well, think about Dave Johnson.

[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.720]
He looks and sounds the same way he did like 30 years ago.

[01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:38.880]
He never changes.

[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:40.700]
You mean he always looked at old?

[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:45.280]
Oh, wait till the Freakness man.

[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:45.940]
Oh, yeah.

[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:47.180]
Let's go.

[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:54.120]
Neil God, WQL, where the bag is.

[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:01.100]
Bum bum bum bum bum the rest.

[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.220]
Bum bum bum bum bum the rest.

[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:06.260]
Bum bum bum bum the rest.

[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:07.320]
Bum bum bum bum the rest.

[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.660]
Bum bum bum bum the rest.

[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.680]
Bum bum bum bum the rest.

[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:14.120]
Bum bum bum the rest.

[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:14.240]
Bum bum bum the rest.

[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.060]
Bum bum bum the rest.

[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:15.120]
Bum bum bum the rest.

[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.600]
Bum bum the rest.

[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.160]
Bum bum the rest.

[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:23.400]
Bum Bum bum the rest.

[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:24.500]

[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:25.920]
Bum bum bum the rest.

[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:29.640]
Bum bum bum bum the rest.

[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:32.700]

[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.180]
Bum bum bum the rest.

[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.720]
Bum bum bum the rest.

[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.860]
Bound their ass, give them what they want

[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:44.700]
Leave the greasy spot, send them up to be with Google Play

[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:51.840]
Bound their ass, Bound their ass, Bound their ass

[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.440]
Bound their ass, prepare them for their graphics

[01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:06.700]
Bound their ass, Bound their ass, Bound their ass, Bound their ass, Bound their ass, Bound their ass

[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:10.340]
They started out with the little thing on there, said 108

[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.440]
And now they've opted to 109

[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.480]
So maybe they'll have that on every TV channel, I thought they wanted you to get nervous or panicky

[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:23.260]
But they'll start putting that number in the corner somewhere in every TV channel, even on the comedy channel

[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.440]
How many people would swine flu now, you know?

[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.400]
By the way, you know that little kid from Mexico who died in Texas yesterday?

[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:32.360]
Yes, the first fatality from a new West

[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:38.520]
Come to fight out on one newscast, I think on radio here on 680 News

[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:44.420]
I think I heard them, I know I heard them say that he had another health problem

[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:50.200]
So in other words, he didn't just die from the flu, he already was in a weakened condition because he had some other health problem

[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.020]
Which they didn't specify what it was, but he was already a week

[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:53.620]
I see

[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:57.980]
Now wouldn't you think they would mention that more often and let people know?

[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.420]
No, no, no, it's way more exciting to leave that part out

[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:02.400]
That I was up 90 points

[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:07.780]
Oh and in line with what I just played there, Abdul says I got to just got a job as a human bomb

[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:12.760]
They tell me there would be a lot of blood and guts but not to worry because I'll be with Allah and lots of virgins

[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.860]
I hope they're not all women

[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:17.860]
I picture his below a big boy, Allah is great, they told me to say that, love Abdul

[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:19.940]
Thanks Abdul, there you go

[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.340]
109 US cases, divine swine flu

[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:27.940]
You think if divine got to shine flu?

[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:29.680]
That would do it I think

[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:36.820]
Congrats on the good numbers, is our friend Lawrence, given the straight jacket and gag that's been on your show, you and George is there a lot of credit

[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:38.100]
Hear that, you and George

[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:42.460]
Ah, Joe Bell came in and shook your hand, I'm never going to recover from that

[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:45.160]
I don't think I'm ever going to wash it

[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:53.620]
This is a man with lacking in some kind of human element, I can't exactly put my thumb on it

[01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:58.200]
He has no Rachmanus

[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:02.400]
Just imagine if you could do the show that you really want to do it, says he had just imagined

[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:08.500]
George could joke and blow it out his ass clown, although he'll probably say that there was a method in his madness and take some credit for the numbers

[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:13.000]
Oh yeah, we couldn't have done it without Jolly Joe, and Joyce, and Clarence

[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.480]
The vows up 93 points

[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:21.780]
Jimmy Cifalus comes back with an idiotic email, oh of course they're all idiotic

[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:25.620]
Anybody could get ratings in the mid-day besides Rush there's no competition, yeah besides Rush

[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:28.940]
I'd dear you to go on in the morning, you wouldn't break a tutu

[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:33.120]
I have the number two rated spoken word show in the market right behind my buddies Paul and Ron

[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:35.740]
Yeah, they got an eight something you got a four

[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.280]
I was happy my close friend Joe Rose had a Salah 3.4 share

[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.480]
And I hate to break the news to you, but the one time I did do mornings in this market on Zeta

[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.840]
Kicked everybody's ass, AM, FM, PM, BM

[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.280]
Wouldn't break a tutu my ass, you ought to be wearing a tutu, Jimmy you look really good in it

[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:51.920]
You're fairie

[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.160]
Jimmy Cifalidic

[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:55.880]
Dary it, you go on in the morning

[01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:01.420]
I told you a long time ago that Greg read off from me two million a year to do mornings

[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:03.360]
Yes, I know

[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.160]
Yeah, he did

[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:07.840]
Should have taken it

[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.660]
What, what do you know?

[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:11.760]
No, I'd expect that would have been a good idea, maybe

[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:15.360]
No, it would not have been a good idea, I'd be out plowing fields or something right away

[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:15.540]
Really?

[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:16.980]
Planning it to me this

[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:22.180]
Barry Jackass is, I listened to Baba, he has a good show and he speaks highly of you

[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:24.720]
I don't care if he sucks my ass, okay, I don't care

[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:26.540]
I'm not impressed

[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:31.340]
That doesn't mean he's got a good show or is doing well in the market

[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:36.740]
He shows it times if I can borrow a term compelling radio, says the fake Barry, does that tell you who this is?

[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:37.400]
Yeah

[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.620]
Mr. Radio, is there again Mr. Radio

[01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:49.000]
Sick person, sick groupie, sick infested, infected, nauseating, he's got bad dung on his tongue

[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:52.560]
Especially when Hulk Hogan is on, oh that's compelling, yeah

[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:56.400]
I think this show will do well with white non-Hispanic men 18 to 34

[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.920]
Well it hasn't so far

[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:01.300]
Paul and young Ron had Dan Marina on this morning

[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:05.560]
Your recent rating success proves the email format is working George, keep it up in the good work too

[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:06.780]
George

[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:07.760]
Oh, okay

[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:10.180]
Well that's because you keep knocking emails

[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:13.400]
Well you haven't lately though, that's good

[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.240]
Do we want to have the conversation again?

[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:17.620]
No I don't want to have any conversation about it

[01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:18.740]
But it's not going to emails, what do you say?

[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:21.680]
This is what I do and this is what they are and this is what I'm doing

[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:24.840]
I wasn't knocking the emails, I was ripping chronics

[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:28.380]
Well, there's a whole bunch of them

[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:30.020]
The whole bunch of them is a chronic, isn't it?

[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:33.620]
I'm not doing it, I'm doing it, I'm doing it, I can't but as you know, since you get your own emails

[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.040]
You get a lot of the same ones that I do

[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:39.340]
As you know, there isn't exactly the greatest discernment of good material out there

[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:41.280]
So I do the best I can with what I get

[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:42.340]
Of course you do

[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:45.260]
And I think during these months that we've been doing this, I think it's worked out

[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:46.500]
Stellar Stella

[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.140]
If I say so myself

[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:54.400]
I mean there was never going to be a solution to

[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.520]
I'm your friend, we're never going to do anything about that

[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:57.320]
And you want to know why?

[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:58.840]
Because they're scared of their own shadow

[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:02.620]
I don't think that's why

[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:07.640]
Well plus the fact that those calls help make this your fail

[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.980]
Right, you wanted it, something that you want

[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:12.800]
So they're going to do the opposite

[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.160]
I have never ever in my life

[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:22.760]
worked for anybody in this business who has been less supportive than this regime

[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:26.360]
You can't complain about the support we get from them because there isn't any

[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:34.040]
Let's fire George, let's do this don't say this and don't play that and don't don't don't don't don't don't

[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:39.360]
They should have a big billboard campaign WQM don't do it don't say it don't play it don't don't

[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:44.200]
Don't and can't and won and yet we still have the number and by the way

[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:48.200]
Now let me see Joe had a three four in the morning managed had a two eight

[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:55.260]
You put them together you got a six two we had what about a six six six seven at least in the day

[01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:02.420]
So hire a higher number than the two drive times put together I just mentioned that in passing that's not an aqua Joe or mad dog and I'm just saying

[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:10.360]
And isn't it coincidence don't you think that the only non pure sports show across the street that gets any kind of a number

[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:17.880]
Although dwindling and diminishing rapidly is the afternoon with LeBas do then he doesn't do that the pure sports show talking the same crap non-stop

[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:19.800]
It must be just a coincidence

[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:33.500]
Somebody want to know how depot it we we overlooked that sorry me fo how do you do in the mornings there men 25 54 the target demo certainly of these sports stations

[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:46.160]
Is he on the first page what is a WFTL and how do you tell which WFTL that's the obvious great look at that one for for waxy what that's you guys over there are a second win man

[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:50.320]
You are living in a dream world. No wonder they don't have a morning show

[01:21:51.640 --> 01:22:01.340]
They got nobody to put on the air. I'm looking what am I looking for WFTL? Well, I'm on the oh there it is. Oh you are gonna be in heaven when you hear this okay

[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:08.820]
Now let me see they had a 0.3 in the previous book there are 32

[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:22.240]
Two stations listed guess what place DFO came in 31 no 32 right wow and guess what the number is 0.1 no 0.0 yes

[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:31.820]
Let's tip our hat all those DFO liquors out there. Oh DFO would be great and with the mad dog and DFO had a

[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:36.820]
Oh, no number doesn't even show up a cum of a thousand people in

[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:44.760]
Fact there are 33 stations listed. They were 33rd WFTL Steve Lapa and James crystal radio there you go normal

[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:50.020]
That's your good buddies at James crystal radio got to be kidding me

[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:55.820]
A 0.0. No wonder we want to stay there the figures he saved there I guess

[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:03.080]
There's that an incredible number or what that is a stellar

[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:09.460]
It's just where it says average quarter hour our share average quarter hour listeners and average quarter rating. It's just blank

[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:17.320]
You I'm sure you have it there in your men 25 54 6 to 10 a.m. Mm-hmm look at it to look at it to say it is one thing

[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:19.300]
That's bad enough, but to look at it to see it

[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:23.420]
And when we got the annealed deal coming up in a couple minutes. What are we doing?

[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:28.940]
Well, we got so much going on today although we got Dave Johnson done was fine right

It might rub off

[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:50.200]
Oh

[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.460]

[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.200]
Okay, I

Leaps and bounds and of course in New York where you've got like 15 million people and there's all those high school kids have got it that they picked up in Mexico

[01:24:54.840 --> 01:25:01.120]
Wouldn't you think there'd be a lot more than that wouldn't there'd be thousands by now if it was as contagious as they say from person to person

[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:01.700]
Yeah

[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:04.960]
I'm not trying to downplay it

[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:08.700]
But I'm also trying to say don't don't go into a cool sweat and have an nervous break

[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:12.380]
Of course if you do go into a cool sweat, you probably got it. Right, but don't panic

[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.700]
And that little kid at other health issues the one that died

23 months old little boy, but they're not talking about that in the mainstream media the MSM because they want you to oh somebody's dead from it already we're all gonna die

[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:31.500]
Just don't sneeze in my face. That's what I would suggest

[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:35.600]
Don't sneeze don't cough in my direction. Please

Been so long since he mentioned Willie Nelson. Thank God I'd forgotten

Like this is the guy who was obsessed with freaking Willie Nelson. You might want to congratulate Jason from Merimar for winning the $50 certificate that we gave away online just now

[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:12.320]

[01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:00.860]
The local police here the Toronto police finally decided to tell us relinquents to get off university avenue

[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:04.440]
Which is one of the main north south the streets in this town

[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.360]
Four days they had the street tied blocked off

[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:11.220]
For blocks right now hearted downtown

[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:19.620]
Well, what what do they want all new people like he demonstrating what do you want from other countries if you're so pissed off about what's going on in Sri Lanka

Go back there and straighten to do right when it doubts straight to do

[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:28.720]
So they finally got him off the street this morning. Hopefully they're not there

[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:31.280]
Sri Lanka my ass

[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:37.880]
You ever been to Sri Lanka you have any desire to go there? No look on the map. You look at India and then there's a little turd

[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:40.820]
That's what hangs down you remember my policy right

[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:45.400]
Don't go to places where people are risking their lives to leave oh

[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:47.900]
Mean like Cuba and Mexico

[01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:51.340]
Mexico they're rather they're

[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:55.620]
Bursting across the border man and it Texas. I think Texas ought to still be part of Mexico

[01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.880]
Wouldn't that be a good idea sure let's move that fence you know that fence the border

[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:04.440]
Yeah, let's move it to the northern part of Texas. Yeah, you go from there you go

[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:08.900]
Oh, you know something you can include Oklahoma near too for my part

[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:10.160]
66

[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:12.580]
77

[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:19.120]
He says can George finally acknowledge your email form it as a success

[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:22.280]
Can you finally acknowledge it

[01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:26.400]
George

[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:34.880]
I didn't respond I didn't say that there was a problem with the emails. I said chronic cranks our chronic cranks

[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:37.600]
Whether they're calling faxing or emailing

[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:43.700]
That's what I said 67 it's still 67 on the certificates

[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.840]
The fake Tom jikas says I'm sorry for D.Fo. He's a good talent. Oh my god

[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:57.160]
How could he have a 0.0 share sad sad but true oh point oh

[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:02.780]
All you are new people are obsessed with D.Fo. You're you're living in you know what this reminds me of

[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:08.360]
It's like the crowd that keep talking about oh those days at iod with you and Rick and sudson fill and Randy

[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:10.080]
And then that's a hundred years ago

[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:13.660]
You can't live in the past in this business or in life in general

[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:18.120]
61 points stop living in the past

[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:25.200]
DeFo is a good talent. Well what when was that

[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:29.240]
That's before Steve Nicoletta hold him in turn him into a corn ball goofball

[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:31.240]
paranoid

[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:37.420]
In fact, where's that thing with D.Fo and Rimmer can't go a segment without mentioning Neil Roger

[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:44.340]
I have no problem with D.Fo but D.Fo is somewhat intimidated and it's like laws or repeat

[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:48.760]
Intimidated by what Jeff what do you have that I'm intimidated by?

[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:51.720]
I don't know you kind of turn red when I come in the studio

[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:57.140]
Why would I turn red when you come in here just because I'm looking at a guy that's trying to warm his way under this show

[01:31:57.140 --> 01:32:01.100]
I'm not warning my way, huh? I don't want your way talking about you know what this goes back

[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:02.760]
Let's clear the air right now Jeff Rimmer

[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:07.980]
Yeah back at the island dreams former radio station when you came on the air on Neil Roger's show and trashed

[01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:09.480]
Virtually everybody that worked at the station

[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:14.660]
I got the feeling that you were sending a message to Neil and trying to work your way around going through conventional

[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:20.460]
Systems that about getting a job on the air that you were saying that I was sandbag and your chances of getting on the radio

[01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:25.520]
And that's what I kept hearing from people that knew you personally and instead of saying it to me

[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:28.940]
You're running around saying oh well, it's the forest is the reason I'm not getting a job

[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:31.420]
Oh, that's not true. That's not true. But anyway, I want to be on

[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:49.200]
I'm intimidated by you who wouldn't be uncomfortable with a guy that's trying to stab you in the back. Oh

[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:55.480]

What a relief just when you thought we were finished when it was ready to stick a fork in us

[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:33.200]

Still 65 on air huh

[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:55.100]
Boy remember the salad days the glory days when these things used to go like but that that that's back when people

[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:58.620]
I say I had money right remember those days a new thing then you know

[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:04.680]
I think it's more byproduct of people having money yeah

[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:08.640]
Sunny I'm telling you nobody's got any money everybody's broke

[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.140]
Except the people it would buy

[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:16.140]
Although we even there you know when I go with my cabin he pulls in a lot

[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:20.400]
See I'm always hoping that it's basically empty like when I go real early on the weekends

[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:24.440]
Because then I get whatever machine I want I can like try different ones find the hot machine

[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:30.680]
But it's uh it ain't what it used to be man used to be even the nap after like on a Thursday afternoon

[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:33.180]
You're driving the parking lot be pretty damn full not no more

[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:36.180]
Maybe I'll go and fight out this afternoon

[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.960]
What do you think do it?

[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:42.960]
Are you thinking about it? Yep

[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:48.740]
Okay rich says I bought my certificate

[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:57.580]
But I'm guessing the reason you're moving a bit slower than normal for such a great place is the factors certificates

[01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:01.820]
Who only be used Tuesday Wednesday or Thursdays it makes it a bit of a challenge for people with kids

[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:05.340]
Which thankfully doesn't apply to me he says who might normally only eat out on weekends

[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:08.300]
Yeah, that's that's the point there are different factors, you know

[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:12.560]
Right there's the max factor and then there's the rich factor factor

[01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:15.300]
Oh

[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:17.400]

[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:33.680]

[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:42.160]
Although Nick initially detested heath they eventually became close in fact Nick eventually became closer to heath and jirid

[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:46.120]
What what is that the big valley that's what that is

[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:50.800]
Yeah, the major wasn't in bananza, but he was no big valley with barbers than you were the outsider

[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:53.440]

[01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:57.480]
Boy you that's the hell of a memory for a bad show the big valley

[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:01.980]
I think it was about barbersand we kind of want to give you any ideas her

Beautiful barbers standwick you know they people that your mom always talks to

[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:29.220]
What they always said oh they they said you know they I didn't agree with them mom used to get a lot of information from they you know what they say

[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:32.360]
You know what opus is oh

[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:36.140]
Like I said my mother meant well, but

[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:40.680]
In many ways not too bright you know I'm saying yeah

[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:45.380]
As opposed to my mom who never means well, no, no, no, no, no, don't start on your mom. I

[01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:48.180]
Don't start on your mama

[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:55.220]
Evil bitch, because then I'll tell that story that you told me don't tell I don't want to do it. Please don't I won't outrageous

[01:41:58.240 --> 01:41:59.920]
The vows of 74 points

[01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:05.400]
Well your mom is outrageous. Yeah crazy. Maybe we could find a hitman

[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:06.640]
Oh

[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:10.520]
In fact, maybe mom could invite Joe over for some tea

[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:14.080]
The kind of like smooth things over for you. Yeah

[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:22.980]
Since he seems to be taking over that part of your life, you know promotion. Yeah, well, we don't get any here. I'll tell you that

[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:30.760]
That's the thing that makes it astonishing that we got a six something share wait till those hourlies come out man

[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.480]
As they're gonna be tomorrow. I don't know probably

[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:42.160]
And I won't be here maybe you'll text me let me know I will text me what the hourlies were I will

[01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:49.120]
Also, let me know what two to four was because I don't think it's really gonna be rock solid. I could be wrong about that

[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:54.300]
I mean, I got nothing personal against the big O I barely even know him, you know, I think I've seen him like three times in my life

[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:57.720]
It's not personal it's business

[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:02.940]
And I think we need to find somebody in there two to four who can do more than a one share

[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:09.720]
We haven't we haven't we haven't had a number in the air since when since mad dog was doing two to five two to four whatever he was right following you

[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:12.480]
He had big numbers in there

[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:17.920]
He made somewhat of a comeback in his last book

[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:21.040]
And LeBasterd is dropping

[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:27.240]
His once enormous numbers over there are like dwindling and dwindling down to a three two. That's a big number

[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:30.160]
And

[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:34.620]
I still say from four to seven you're gonna find that the two of them are like just about dead even

[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:37.160]
LeBasterd and mad dog

[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:41.000]
Right you take out the three four are I mean what can the three four hour be

[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:48.440]
Something close to a close to that we got a lot of hours that begin with in the market DFO's got a point. Oh

[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.120]
How would you feel if you were doing a show you've been on in the market for like many many how what's it been on a hundred years

[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:55.280]
easy

[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:56.920]
at least

[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:06.420]
How would you feel if the book came out and you had a zero you can have any diaries nobody nobody voted for it nobody

[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:10.120]
Not even one die book came out and I had a zero and I still had a job

[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.960]
You'd be happy. I feel like a luckyest

[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:17.940]
You take the bank and wow I work for a stupid guy and I'm sure I'm lucky

[01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:22.900]
Well, he does work for a stupid guy works for your Steve Lapa and like Norma can't always said everything Steve Lapa

[01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:26.020]
Touches turns to Schmidt. He's got the mightest touch and reverse

[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:33.800]
They're all all these make-believe stations on here. That's a problem 33 stations my ass

[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:39.240]
In fact, you know something if I had the time which I do but I'm not gonna do it's boring

[01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:43.500]
We could go down the list of all these stations that are listed on here and how many

[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:46.900]
How many we even heard of their stations on here I never even heard of

[01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:53.200]
WWFE I mean that's Spanish language radio fake

[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:58.400]
Remember we saw that that was in the up-paxing building when we were IOD Paxon

[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:06.800]
WAVS I think that's Haitian melodies or something WACC. I mean what are these stations then there's radio smegma that's going over really big

[01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:16.220]
Radio Suave all these little marginal stations with their 10 watts and and then of course is the other WFTA or wait a minute

[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:23.240]
Well, I'm assuming that's the one DFO's on WFTL that's that's uh

[01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:26.640]
Or he's on 640 I bet so this one is the 851

[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:28.980]
Sure

[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:31.620]
So he doesn't show up at all

[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:36.020]
How are we supposed to tell which one is which which one has the towing?

[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:43.580]
I don't know I guess we're not that that's what happens when the FCC allows insanity like that more than one station with the same

[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:45.820]
Collaters how was that possible?

[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:48.700]
What's got nothing to do with duty?

[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:57.260]
So so he might not even show up at all he might be not even listed

[01:45:57.820 --> 01:46:00.820]
Because I'm sure that that WFTL is the a50 he's on the 641

[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:03.060]
The one with four watts

[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:06.620]
The one with the transmitters connected to like a pop-up toaster

[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:10.700]
Yeah, poor me fo man poor me fo

[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:11.020]
I

[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:14.680]
Think Rimmer put an end to his career

[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:21.800]
Who's who do you think's got the bigger inferiority complex DFO or Greg Budell good poll question

[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:22.600]
Grebudell

[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:26.780]
Who is most detested by everyone Grebudell or DFO?

[01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:27.940]
Grebudell

[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:31.420]
Haven't heard from the fake Grebudell in a wild fact

[01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:36.420]
I'm surprised he hasn't chimed in here about these numbers the course minister radio Supersie being the fake Tom zick and the face fake

[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:37.380]
Burry jackass today

[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:40.880]
Oh

[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.960]
Radio is what the news for you

[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:58.020]
You wanted more and you got it the mad dog is back singing more duet on bandage scenes volume two

[01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:18.040]
Number eight is back carrying off with the great singing more big hits with even more six stars the mad dog does them all

[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:39.120]
All right

[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:51.060]
It's an all new British invasion with the mad dog singing like a man

[01:47:55.860 --> 01:48:01.980]
The truth is finally out that G-manage was truly the fifth people

[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:11.680]
The

[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:13.120]
Now your head to stay

[01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:25.220]
Here's the bad dogs and her touching tribute to the king

[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:44.020]
The mad dog was just a little ambivalent when we asked him if he wanted to do it again

[01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:47.600]
Now I don't think so so we had look a grotsie

[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:54.100]
Pay them a little visit and tell him either his brains or his signature would wind up on the contract that's some of a bitch

[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:02.100]
This cute

[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:11.280]
And it's sick volume two available now if you move quickly

[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:25.180]
Oh

[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:32.500]
All right, okay 12 of 20 33 whatever the hell it is

[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:38.500]
We got 56 left is the last time I looked yep. Is that correct? Yep as in Q 56

[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:40.320]
honest certificates

[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:44.300]
Doug Lindsay the fake dog says great job on a recent book

[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:49.580]
I think the grossest thing would be watching jolly joe bell cleaning Schmidt in the hallway now. I would enjoy watching that

[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:53.040]
I would take a certain amount of sadistic pleasure

[01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:55.720]
In that

[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:58.060]
Geno says hey Neil since you have the numbers

[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:01.800]
I was wondering how nine forty was doing before they switched the sports and how they are doing now

[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:07.600]
Well, how do we know how they're doing now they've only been this crap that they are now their sports thing a few weeks

[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:11.600]
Yeah, they were doing crap they were doing squat

[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:16.360]
It would be nice though the ratings have dived not that they were that high to begin with like I can't well

[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:17.380]
They're not going to begin anything

[01:50:18.180 --> 01:50:20.940]
They're basically like a non-factor. It's almost like they don't exist

[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:23.560]
50,000 watts right in the middle of the dial

[01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:29.080]
And leave it to chief channel man to take the best signal in the state and turn it into a non-factor

[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:33.520]
They can do it if anybody knows how they're the experts

[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:42.000]
Paul says I got this texted to me they want what is that?

[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:51.420]
Oh, no, I'm not I'm not reading that that's the second one of those I've gotten bad taste about the president

[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:54.200]
Hmm, you get one of those yeah

[01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:55.900]
not funny

[01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:04.680]
racially insensitive at best 457 votes on the poll gross this thing you ever had to do clean up puke 119

[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:07.580]
Clean up diarrhea 81 after that small potatoes

[01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:11.380]
After that teeny and tiny

[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.440]
Have sex with a gross person that's third

[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:18.100]
Yeah

[01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:21.620]
You can imagine being a hooker

[01:51:23.580 --> 01:51:26.880]
Uh, no, can you even begin to imagine it? No

[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:33.760]
Talk about selling your whole soul. Mm-hmm wow

[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:38.500]
Vitting down with some a sweat sweaty smelly

[01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:41.700]
Eee greasy. Yeah, I'm I'm smelling it

[01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:47.220]
Candidate for Georgia governor ship says he killed his own son to succeed

[01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:53.640]
I think that the people in deep south about 40% of them are crazy within a bedbug. No, I'll be left up

[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:54.340]
You notice that

[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:59.940]
A long shot Georgia candidate for governor who's already admitted having sex with a mule before finding God

[01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:03.320]
Did you get that part?

[01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:09.960]
sex with a mule before finding God says he's ready to sacrifice his own son in an effort to get a state to succeed from the union

[01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:14.220]
I were back to the civil war again. I wonder if that's because we've got a black president

[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:16.300]
Neil Horsley

[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:21.260]
Made national headlines when he posted the names phone numbers and addresses of abortion doctors online

[01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:25.760]
His Nuremberg files website also crossed off the names of doctors as they were killed

[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:30.680]
Now he's ready to make more news in an interview published late yesterday

[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:35.000]
He indicated he'd kill his own son to dissolve the US in an effort to overturn roe v. Wade

[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:39.060]
As if his rate of sacrifice his own son in the national insurrection

[01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:42.080]
Horsely be counts to fight with his son where he almost killed him

[01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:46.000]
I was one foot from killing my own son or hurting him really really bad

[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.060]
Horsely said. I wonder if that was before or after he had sex with a mule

[01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:54.780]
If he would have attacked me again, I would have stuck him or cut him or sliced him or done something to stop him

[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:59.940]
That's the point you hiver your hypothetical has really literally been worked out with me

[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.820]
And that's what makes me different from the other candidates for governor

[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:06.920]
They understand I'm not like no politician. They've looked at ever. That's right like no politician

[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:08.720]
I'm prepared to do a John Brown

[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:13.200]
I'm not prepared to do an ablick and talk out of both sides of my mouth and try to get a majority together

[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:15.760]
I'm looking for people who are prepared to go with me

[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:20.840]
And take over the foundry then set up shop and be prepared to fight the death. I'll do it

[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:27.340]
Asked again if he was willing to sacrifice his son. He was even more explicit telling the interview to read the

[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:28.640]
Bibles Matthew 10

[01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:33.000]
Your own family are going to be your greatest enemy because unless you love me more than you love your father

[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:33.980]
Your son your wife your daughter

[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:35.960]
You're not fit to be my disciple Horsely said

[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:38.880]
That's why there's a real rift of a strangement in my family

[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:42.520]
He says I can tend this is really about people's ability to believe in God

[01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:46.220]
When it comes to that place when you're talking about God's plan to protect himself

[01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:51.060]
Then the lives of people become really almost irrelevant and the degree they result in him being glorified

[01:53:51.060 --> 01:53:52.320]
That's the nature of the truth

[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:54.520]
You know what that sounds like to me?

[01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:55.400]
Look at me

[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:56.380]
Gobbly gook

[01:53:56.860 --> 01:54:02.180]
And an earlier TV interview with Alan Comes the would-be successionist said he'd had sex with a meal when he was a child

[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:09.360]
When you grew up on a farm in Georgia your first girl friend is a mew will he said adding your experiment with anything that moves when you're growing up sexually

[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:11.120]
You experiment with anything that moves

[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:20.260]
Did you know that uh no I've been in a lot of rural areas growing up as you know and none of us were ever inclined

[01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:24.480]
Well, that's what Neil Horsley says well, sorry. Maybe that's why they call him Horsley

[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:26.560]
Hey, Horsey

[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:32.220]
So Dave Johnson picked real a regal ransom

[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:37.240]
31 in the morning line for the Derby I'm picking. I want revenge for the favorite with Joe Talima

[01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:41.240]
And why what do I know about it if I've seen the other horses running in this race?

[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:42.800]
No, no, what do you know about it?

[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:43.240]
You're nothing

[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:46.760]
I know as much as I want to know in rumsan

[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:51.560]
No, enjoy watching horse racing on TV with no bets. I know that's crazy. I enjoy the sport

[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:53.660]
I enjoy the spectacle

[01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:58.260]
But I do not want any a part of getting involved in oh look at that

[01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:02.540]
We just lost one we had 56 now we're back to 57. Yeah, I said oh

[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:04.080]
Boy

[01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:05.660]
Q 57

[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:08.440]
Maybe that's a problem. Maybe we're on 570

[01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:11.260]
Maybe our crystal radio is a little bit off

[01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:15.260]
Did you ever have a crystal radio? No, I did as a kid

[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:18.680]
And you could like tune it to like

[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:21.860]
What different frequencies within a very narrow range? Okay

[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:29.220]
Was it like all wide open like just a circuit board with just a stuff plugged into it there? You're asking me like I remember

[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:33.580]
You start forgetting I'm a dottering old man

[01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:44.240]
And what else happening with this

[01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:56.000]
His name is Calderon and his Obama

[01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:06.240]
Both tried their best to curb the flow of coke and marijuana

[01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:10.040]
Oh, there were very murders

[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:13.440]
Some really grew sound

[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:19.580]
From the big cartels who are making big mullah

[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:24.100]
Oh

[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:27.000]
Rival gangs kill and people get in shot

[01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:31.140]
For president said this has got to stop

[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:35.060]
Trying to control the legal flow of drugs

[01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:38.220]
In the job that is tough

[01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:42.740]
I'll tell you folks just what we should do

[01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:47.320]
Just tighten up the quarter by sending in the troops

[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:50.080]
The perfect way to let them people draw chords

[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:52.840]
No what happened down in Mexico

[01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:56.420]
She's staying Mexico

[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:04.720]
Yes, stay in Mexico and don't come here and inspect the rest of his please pretty please

[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:07.140]
Caught 45 at 560 WQ AM

[01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:10.220]
They're not getting too hyperventilatingly a hysterical today on the news

[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:12.480]
Olga aren't you pleased? Yes

[01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:18.740]
Because otherwise people are going to be jumping off the tops of tall buildings the ones who aren't already broken the suicidal from that

[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:21.640]
And

[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:23.480]
Autistic boy stole his dad's car

[01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:26.960]
Drought to the airport by the way. We got 55 certificates left

[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:30.560]
Drought to the airport and flew across the country because he loves planes

[01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:31.900]
the right

[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:37.720]
13-year-old Kent and weaver of Boka has a form of autism called Asperger syndrome

[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:39.820]
And he is completely obsessed with airplanes

[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:44.040]
In fact, Kent and the so fascinated with planes that on Tuesday his stole his dad's car

[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:48.060]
Drought to the airport and used dad's credit card number to buy ticket from Southwest Airlines

[01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:55.000]
Then Kent and then Kent and boarded a plane and flew across the country to San Jose, California all by himself

[01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:01.580]
But listen to this since he's only 13 Kent and doesn't have a passport a driver's license or any other form of photo ID

[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:09.180]
Which begs the question how was the 13-year-old autistic boy with no ID able to slip past airport security in order to report a cross-country flight

[01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:14.000]
And more importantly, what does it say about the state of our airport security in general? What does it say?

[01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:15.580]
Not a lot

[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:22.220]
Ernie Barnes is dead celebrity death never heard of him

[01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:27.680]
You're here for Ernie Barnes. No, we need some emails by the way for that big one to two-hour

[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:29.920]
We need a lot of emails kneel at nearodgers.com

[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:34.200]
They've come to a screeching halt. I guess we did probably too well in the ratings. I guess

[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:39.900]
Well, we don't do well which lately under Joe Bell we haven't for like two and a half years

[01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:43.200]
Oh jeez you guys are the best and don't worry and

[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:46.180]
Yeah, yeah, not that we're looking for people to kiss our ass

[01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:51.060]
Because Jimmy syphilis has got the number two rated show and the spoken word in the market. I see

[01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:52.640]
Jimmy syphilitic

[01:58:54.340 --> 01:58:56.980]
You know the one thing about a lot of these ex-jocks

[01:58:57.500 --> 01:59:00.920]
They really consider themselves broadcasters. That's the thing that muses me

[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:07.380]
They think that because they predated the game and took a lot of showers naked with a bunch of other guys and more jocs drafts

[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:11.980]
Therefore that makes them into broadcasters now because they grew up during this era of the jococracy

[01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:20.800]
Which of course I guess is part and parcel why we had that little countertops over the weekend between Jimmy syphilitic and

[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:22.000]
rock solid that one

[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:25.160]
Yeah, because that one never played the game, you know

[01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:27.400]
Never suited up with the fish

[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:33.660]
Never took my I don't know if he took naked showers with other guys or not. I don't know. I have to ask him maybe in school

[01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:35.220]
You think

[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:41.480]
It will yeah, we all did we didn't all swim naked in school, but we all took naked showers with guys in gym class

[01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:44.140]
Oh, boy

[01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:48.680]

Louise Lewis Rodriguez

[02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:24.080]
Barnes was a child of the segregated south who transcended racial barriers to play for the Denver Broncos and San Diego churches before pursuing his real dream to be an artist

[02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:30.480]
He became the official artist of the 84 Olympic Games in LA whose insights from his trials on the gridiron resulted in powerful

[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:36.380]
Sometimes haunting portraits of agility strength and of the emotional cost of fierce competition

[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:39.920]
His style which critics have described as neomanorous

[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:45.140]
What is that ever sounds like some pseudo intellectual pile of crap neo-manorist

[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:51.660]
Became familiar to a prime time TV audience in the mid 1970s when Norman producer Norman Lear hired Barnes to ghost

[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:20.180]
Oh

[02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:21.300]
As the backdrop of the show's

[02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:30.160]
And you cut it off before the good part

[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:36.420]
Well, you want to okay, it's good as the backdrop of the show's closing quitted lyrics

[02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:42.520]
Barnes 1971 painting sugar shack remember that song by Jimmy Gilmer sugar shack young dot records. Yep

Cover art for 1976 album. I want you Jimmy Gilmer on dot records. This was number one. I think for 85

I can still talk him up. We're keep taking tricky tricky. Never responded when he never followed up that my face

[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:09.000]
Maybe he's uh, he's finished with me now

[02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:11.680]
Think maybe I don't know

[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:17.640]
And isn't interesting that he was giving me a son of an answer about taking calls and I didn't take calls for this whole book and we kicked ass

[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:18.680]
Rectom. Yeah

Riding and jumping to the rhythms of a black jazz club

[02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:47.820]
There is joy tension and despair in the canvas which Barnes once said was inspired by memory of being barred from attending a dance when he was a child

[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:52.840]
As in nearly all of his paintings the subjects eyes are closed and we flexed at the artist off state

[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:54.940]
It believes that we are blind to each other's humanity

[02:02:56.180 --> 02:03:03.300]
Singer songwriter Bill Withers who was close to Barnes during the last decade of his life said the artist often spoke of wanting to educate people through his art

[02:03:04.460 --> 02:03:05.840]
How do you like that now he's dead

[02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:07.420]

[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:43.820]
Well only

[02:03:46.180 --> 02:03:51.360]
When you know we haven't got a whole lot of other other stuff we can say or do you know dead people we can talk about

[02:03:51.940 --> 02:03:53.680]
As long as we don't say certain words

[02:03:55.960 --> 02:04:01.860]
Let me see fake Doug says oh here's the biography for any Barnes. I just got through reading it stop already stop

[02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:15.400]
I don't think we have a lot of pseudo intellectual art people out there

Just ceremony. Oh you understand the Dutch royal family

[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:44.000]

I'll say you have to work on bridge for five bucks

[02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:19.120]
That was something well. I guess you need to uh

[02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:22.220]
Psychotic about it because she's so got a good sense of humor. Titching

[02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:25.640]
She got little to change George's got a little to change very little. Yeah

[02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:05.900]
Don't you don't give me the soap song. All right. Don't give me no soap song and dance soap. I don't have it. Oh

[02:06:58.780 --> 02:07:03.380]
The Rose it was very late it was discovered there was diarrhea vomit catastrophe in the men's room

[02:07:03.940 --> 02:07:08.960]
I knew I felt bad doing it, but I was told by management owner also happened to be kind of a friend. I had to clean it up

[02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:13.140]
I knew he felt bad doing it whoever'd done it

[02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:17.840]
Well, the economy wasn't all that bad and for goodness sake. I was just a bar back bus boy job while I was in school

[02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:24.300]
It wasn't exactly a career. I said no, I wouldn't do it. Sorry. I figured I was making nine bucks an hour would take me a half hour to clean it up

[02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:28.420]
I'd be making 450 and doing it in no way. I respectfully quit good for you man

Oh, don't you just hate people that use snappy openers for their show segments like that wonder to hour

[02:07:57.660 --> 02:08:00.700]
A little bit of paint

[02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:34.740]
You took a brush and you swing it on your butt as you very gently touch and

We'll paint my balls with colors to display a little bit of paint

[02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:58.540]
Looks better when my balls hang down this way

[02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:02.220]
So just make their town or their dead

[02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:05.900]

[02:09:05.900 --> 02:09:11.180]

[02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:52.140]

Johnny says when I was 17 I had a fling with a smoking hot 32 year old brunette named Joyce

[02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:31.760]
To this day just hearing the name Joyce gives me instant wood

[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:37.180]
Just out of curiosity. I was wondering what the QM Joyce looks like

[02:10:37.180 --> 02:10:40.840]
Uh, you never talk about her physical attributes. That's because she doesn't have any

[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:48.420]
So I was hoping to give us the load on on what she looks like is she hot? Yeah, she's about as hot as the North Pole used to be before it started melting

[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:50.840]
What's her best asset?

[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:55.100]
Oh my god, Johnny you must be a crazy person

[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:01.560]
I've never seen it myself. I've heard tell low and now you did you were in that meeting right? Yep

[02:11:02.740 --> 02:11:05.320]
How would you describe Joyce slight

[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:10.900]
Slight yeah, she's a small person. Yes, Perky

[02:11:11.980 --> 02:11:12.460]
No

[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:15.080]
No

[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:17.540]
Boy the doll is only up 16 points. That's not so great

[02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:19.180]
That blows

[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:25.340]
Jimmy Dorsky's got an interesting email. Let me send you some of these just before the end of the show didn't get to a dammit

[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:30.300]
Neal, do you consider Jewish a religion ethnicity or both

[02:11:31.140 --> 02:11:34.740]
I was born to two Jewish parents one who was actually irish and adopted by Jews

[02:11:34.740 --> 02:11:37.920]
They never succeeded in raising me Jewish. I eventually found atheism

[02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:43.040]
However, my Catholic wife and her family always tell people I'm Jewish regardless of my atheistic views

[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:45.400]
Well, I'm Jewish in atheist. So what what's wrong with that?

[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:52.320]
It's an ethnicity. It's a religion. It's a dietary way of life, huh these days. It's a nationality

[02:11:52.980 --> 02:11:58.860]
All of these things the way I see it just because my parents are Jewish doesn't mean I am any more than being born to a Yankee fan

[02:11:58.860 --> 02:12:00.640]
Parents automatically makes me Yankee fan

[02:12:01.260 --> 02:12:04.420]
Religion is simply nothing more than a team you root for and is a choice

[02:12:04.860 --> 02:12:08.560]
If Florida wants Jesus license plates. I want one with sandy claws

[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:12.320]
How about one with the two fairy or some other fairy? Sure like maybe

[02:12:12.980 --> 02:12:15.840]
Yeah, license the god license plate on the weather fairy

[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:19.700]
The weather for it thought she was retired

[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:26.120]
Well miss Kamali do enough. And now maybe he can make license plates. I'm sure he made a whole bunch of them while he was away

[02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:29.520]
Now is that true? Do they really make license plates in jail?

[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:34.560]
That's true not all of them, but that's a thing that they make in jails in places

[02:12:35.940 --> 02:12:39.200]
And how do they do that? Well, they have a workshop in prisons

[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:44.960]
Most prisons have something going on inside to defer the cost of the prison. Yeah

[02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:51.760]
Some industry in there going on in there like furniture license plates things like that. Yeah, 54 certificates like by the way last time I looked

[02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:57.720]
Not that bad the way things have gone in recent weeks. That's not so bad

[02:12:58.460 --> 02:13:02.480]
When we get the 100 the 100 right 50s for 25 bucks

[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:06.120]
When we get the 50 100s then those go like half cakes

[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:09.160]
Right, but it's a whole different mentality

[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:14.020]
And we do the best we can that that was up 13 point. I wouldn't be surprised if it starts going negative

[02:13:14.020 --> 02:13:15.400]
I don't want to be you know, a negative

[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:18.520]
But here comes the bunny and there goes your money

[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:25.120]
And perspective in terms of we don't know quite how serious this is going to be

[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:25.900]
We don't know how

[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:30.280]
No call it swine flu call it H1N1

[02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:37.180]
Because the pick the pick farmers get upset when you call swine flu or shman

[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:43.420]
Here's one that says when is that stick going up and out far will it reach? I don't I don't know if there is one going up

[02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:46.140]
I don't know the radio and north palm beach

[02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:48.960]
I you know enormous is well he is none of that technical stuff

[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:53.280]
He doesn't understand he's not qualified to discuss that what are you qualified to discuss Norma

[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:55.060]
What are you qualified to discuss?

[02:13:56.780 --> 02:14:02.660]
How can somebody who's allegedly been in radio and represents town in radio not know anything technical about his business

[02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:05.360]
Can you answer me that question?

[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:06.860]
He's a faker

[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:11.560]
The radio and north palm beach sucks and so does your signal says this whoever this is

[02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:19.220]
I have two choices music with heavy rotation which is unbearable or the love doctors 94.3 which is as a close second unbearable

[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:25.300]
These guys drone on all day with no material long process of silence and stupid spitting sounds

[02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:30.040]
They even have a guy who calls in every day at noon and makes disgusting choking gagging noises

[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:35.480]
What the f I've heard better radio at high schools. How does this crap get on fm and you get a m? Well

[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:39.260]
I just wasn't uh, you know born under the right sign

[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:46.480]
The town's only up eight points. What did I tell you? It's gonna start going that red the little red arrow is gonna come on there and they're like oh no

[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:46.720]
Oh

[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:50.760]
Geez I

[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:52.500]
Wonder why that is I don't know

[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:58.780]
Well, you know, it's the Obama bounce and what goes up when you're bouncing a ball for example it goes up and then it comes back down

[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:04.920]
You ever known to say no bouncy bouncy rubber ball by bobby v

[02:15:06.740 --> 02:15:11.340]
Like a rubber ball. Remember I feel hungry. I got into it about bobby v on the iod

[02:15:11.980 --> 02:15:13.480]
No, it didn't yeah

[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:17.300]
Argument about not a real argument, but I mean you know a discussion about that

[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:22.920]
And I'm trying to think I I don't remember whether he liked bobby he arrived

[02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:28.520]
You know what a great song is by bobby v the night has a thousand eyes

[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:31.780]
It's a great song you got it

[02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:36.320]
Bouncy bouncy bouncy bouncy. This is a stupid song

[02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:41.480]
You know what is a great song about rubber ball red rubber ball by the circle

[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:43.840]
You're

He's a good song

[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:49.620]
Yep, I think Phil hated bobby doing the like

[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:52.980]
And he wasn't even cute and was always he is

[02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:57.300]
Oh Phil was sitting behind the chick from the wh. Oh yesterday

[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:01.160]
And you see the Philhaley look like guy that was sitting behind her when she was

[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:02.740]
No, she's raising to level five

[02:16:02.740 --> 02:16:05.920]
No, look just like Phil I swear to god at this time

[02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:09.900]
And he kept doing Margaret's voice which I thought was interesting

[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:15.220]
But I was up three points something. Oh boy won't be long now

[02:16:16.860 --> 02:16:23.740]
Circle red rubber ball on Columbia records great song. I would say 1967 68 something like that

[02:16:24.340 --> 02:16:28.220]

Like I said yesterday what a blessing. Oh the now is making a little comeback in 711.70

[02:16:53.300 --> 02:16:55.620]
It was just on the verge of turning the negative. We don't want to do that

[02:16:56.380 --> 02:17:03.200]
We got enough problems already with the damn swine flu and the worldwide depression. We don't want any red red arrows on there

[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:07.840]
That would be bad. How are we doing with that thing by the way the significance. I don't want to look at it

[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:13.840]
54 54

Gills moving up to the big leagues boy

[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:40.620]

Who's guilt you'll see go over that was up 1.43. I'm telling you it's flirting with negative territory

[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:50.120]
It's flirting with it

[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:52.420]
Now it's up five

[02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:58.980]

[02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:12.260]
What was your initial reaction?

[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:20.280]
Uh, I mean anytime I see him. Oh, you thought maybe this was it yeah

[02:18:21.180 --> 02:18:22.980]
Like go home George go home. Go ahead

[02:18:23.780 --> 02:18:25.060]
Go ahead. Yeah

[02:18:25.060 --> 02:18:25.480]
Well

[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:27.060]
If you recall

[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:31.120]
When Greg Reed tried to fire me was the yeah, the heels of a great book also

[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.860]
And that was the call you got great book. Congratulations on the number

[02:18:34.860 --> 02:18:39.600]
No, no, but that was it if it's true. That's because Moe was demanding that uh he be firing that you might never the less

[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:43.080]
That's how it always happens. We have a great book and uh right on the heels of it

[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:46.640]
Congratulations, Neil and by the way, I've decided to terminate your drinkers

[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:51.640]
Those were great words exactly. I thought he was gonna say hey congratulations today's your last day or tomorrow's your last show say goodbye

[02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:54.460]
Well, he wouldn't do that in the middle of the show, would he?

[02:18:55.300 --> 02:18:55.920]
How do I know?

[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:03.720]
Joe Bell would can you ask in the middle of the show? Everything else he does makes a lot of sense. That seems incredibly insensitive and grotesque to me

[02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:08.100]
I wouldn't believe a word Neil said if his tongue was not right

[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:16.660]
And welcome back to the home. Oh, how would a David is show on there is but Nick sound like red-ditted you know

[02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:28.960]
You know, I got to tell you it's good to be back in New York

[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:33.460]
And it gives me a chance to get away from that mullet head I keep running into every place I go

[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:36.520]

[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:06.780]
No, we got Cisco slid

[02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:09.040]
We got Cinderella man

[02:21:09.460 --> 02:21:09.780]
I

[02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:13.640]
Think one day what we ought to do is go through this thing

[02:21:13.640 --> 02:21:16.260]
Of course the only problem with that is you know how many of these that we can't play

[02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:19.020]
And there are a lot of them we don't know if we can play them or not right

[02:21:20.300 --> 02:21:22.460]
Although we got 400 dump on is that's a good thing

[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:25.340]
We got 54 certificates left right?

[02:21:27.640 --> 02:21:29.940]

[02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:35.220]

[02:21:42.440 --> 02:21:43.360]
That would be nice

[02:21:44.500 --> 02:21:46.780]
Anyway getting back to Vern Gosden. He's still dead

[02:21:47.880 --> 02:21:49.560]
Do you ever hear him? Nope

[02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:56.320]
Singer Vern Gosden who recently who recorded a cut to music hits like the word winning chiseled in stone during a 30 year career

[02:21:56.320 --> 02:21:57.320]
Dottie was 74

[02:21:58.980 --> 02:22:02.700]
Michael Elobre funeral director of Mount Oliveff funeral home in Nashville said Wednesday

[02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:09.020]
The Gosden was under hospice here and died late Tuesday in the area hospital now tell me exactly what is a hospice

[02:22:09.020 --> 02:22:11.340]
I know it's a place where people go waiting to die, you know

[02:22:11.340 --> 02:22:12.620]
Well, that's it what more do you want?

[02:22:13.380 --> 02:22:15.560]
Is it really? Yes, like yes

[02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:21.820]
It's the final destination when you know that you're on the way out that's where you go from a nursing home into a hospice correct

[02:22:21.820 --> 02:22:29.340]
And then you go to the Mount Oliveff funeral and you go to heaven right if you're lucky go to heaven or go to hell, you know

[02:22:30.100 --> 02:22:31.380]
Ha ha ha

[02:22:31.380 --> 02:22:36.320]
Depending on the promise go to heaven what a comedian go to hell. Yeah go to hell go to hell

[02:22:39.740 --> 02:22:46.300]
These singers administrative assistant Don Hull hall said Gosden had a history of strokes and suffered latest one a few weeks ago

[02:22:46.780 --> 02:22:50.160]
We were quite hopeful therefore why because he was showing signs of coming back hall said

[02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:53.740]
Until earlier this month. You say he was independent telling me what to do

[02:22:53.740 --> 02:22:55.620]
He refused a box set in December

[02:22:56.260 --> 02:23:01.100]
Are he released excuse me released a box set in December was renovating his tour bus for an appearance of the

[02:23:01.100 --> 02:23:03.520]
country music associations annual festival in June

[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:10.060]
Chiseled in stone was voted the 1989 song of the year by the CMA in the tune and older man tells the younger man

[02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:16.920]
Who's going through tough times you don't know about sadness till your face life alone. You don't know about lonely if it's chiseled in stone

[02:23:18.780 --> 02:23:19.180]

Till it's just oh till it's chiseled in stone when it's the chiseled in stone when he stick your ass through

[02:23:23.380 --> 02:23:26.040]
I guess vert guys didn't find it out might be lonely now

[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:29.220]
Oh, I don't know. I think he probably got a lot of company underground

[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:36.220]
When you think so I imagine now the worms really getting in those boxes or not is that just a saying?

[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:39.780]
That depends on the no it's not if it's a wooden box

[02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:42.500]
Yeah, like in the olden days

[02:23:43.320 --> 02:23:46.760]
Eventually the maggots will get you. Oh, no the worms

[02:23:47.140 --> 02:23:51.280]
You're in other words you become a magnet a maggot magnet. Yeah, I know some people like that

[02:23:52.420 --> 02:23:56.820]
Gosden who is known as the voice had several other hits in the 70s and he's including set him up Joe

[02:23:56.820 --> 02:23:59.240]
I can tell by the way you dance and I'm still crazy

[02:24:02.720 --> 02:24:03.580]
I'm still crazy

[02:24:05.260 --> 02:24:07.700]
A number of contemporary country stars mourned the loss

Larry Lou Jack and country song here's a lion from the song

It took a hell of a man to take my hand but churred and take it long

[02:24:34.780 --> 02:24:40.700]
I like that yeah, she ain't much to see but she looks good through the bottom of a glass

[02:24:40.700 --> 02:24:47.240]
Oh, yeah, I've heard that one. That's a good one. I wouldn't take you to a dogfight even if I thought you could win

[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:52.480]
Don't cry down my back baby you might rust my spurs

[02:24:56.820 --> 02:25:01.460]
If fingerprints showed up on skin, I wonder who's I'd find on you

[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:04.980]
Here's a good one

[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:09.340]
If you get the feeling that I don't love you feel again

[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:16.120]
I

[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:16.480]
Here's one

[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:23.420]
Obviously is some guy singing this song and he's in some cheap blues. He's bedroom at the time

[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:29.000]
I'm ashamed to be here, but not ashamed enough to leave

[02:25:37.100 --> 02:25:37.500]
I

[02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:40.540]
Think that is sums up our situation here at WLS too

[02:25:40.540 --> 02:25:45.380]
I shame to be here, but not ashamed enough to leave we'll just take the money. Thank you

[02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:50.600]
I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart

[02:25:52.860 --> 02:25:57.480]
Oh, I want to hear it

[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:05.340]
Okay, you really wonder about guys who write lyrics like this. You don't know much drink and they've been doing

[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:11.380]
It's the bottle against the bible and the battle for daddy's soul

[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:14.520]
Here's what I really like

[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:18.300]
It's commode hug and time in the valley

[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:34.860]
Oh

[02:26:34.860 --> 02:26:39.660]
If you want to keep the beer real cold put it next to my ex wife's heart

[02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:47.400]
My wife ran off with my best friend and I miss him

[02:26:51.380 --> 02:26:51.720]
Oh

[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:56.020]
You're listening to Neil Rogers show me yours. I'll show you mine

[02:26:56.020 --> 02:27:02.480]
It's all about Bill ourselves and how I want to lick his big hairy arm

[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:15.140]
I'm diggo coming at you from the ESPN sport hole center in epicat. I mean Epcot

[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:20.580]
Wow look at all the interest there is in the world of sports

[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:22.500]
Hello

[02:27:26.660 --> 02:27:33.660]
Hey, what a game by those merleens huh? Yes, yes, yes

[02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:44.840]
I I don't normally acknowledge life beyond the world of sports, but I want to address the rumors right here and now that no matter how much

[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:49.740]
Oh equals zero. I'm not going anywhere. Okay

[02:27:50.700 --> 02:27:57.940]
I'm in very tight with the management and there convinced that the sports format is a ratings winner

[02:27:58.620 --> 02:28:06.440]
All across the dial when we get that new tower up you're gonna have sports coming out your toaster

[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:12.400]
It's not how much we lose our ass, but how much we think we're never wrong

[02:28:13.020 --> 02:28:17.500]
So I'm staying right here because I live in the world of sports

[02:28:18.380 --> 02:28:20.600]
Nothing else matters of course

[02:28:21.260 --> 02:28:26.360]
Ain't no talk good women at all. I fantasize about balls

[02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:29.040]
130 to 560 wqam

[02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:32.300]
He'll be out of two by the way the big O

[02:28:33.340 --> 02:28:35.960]
And then when those hourly's come out tomorrow or Monday

[02:28:36.500 --> 02:28:40.000]
Then it's gonna be really interesting, you know, mm-hmm

[02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:46.360]
And and the nighttime like I said when you've got a 0.3 from seven of midnight the individual hours

[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:51.980]
You've got to be just staggering you think one of them is a zero at least

[02:28:56.440 --> 02:28:57.860]
Might be a minus one

[02:29:00.540 --> 02:29:01.500]
Minus infinity

[02:29:02.940 --> 02:29:08.940]
The thousand down 26 points toward the red arrows on there not good and there's a bunch of kids running around with mask on a fear

[02:29:08.940 --> 02:29:15.960]
dozens of US school districts have cold off classes and in Mexico where the outbreak began the government's suspending

[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:20.680]
so-called non-fundamental services and urging most businesses to close

[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:23.960]
So what exactly is this blue as I mentioned the government's

[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:31.360]
Technical name now H1N1 and it's a version of the virus that originally in pigs and normally

[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:39.280]
And ends but in rare cases it can spread to humans and that happens when the virus genes mutate

[02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:44.980]
That's what we've seen in this case in fact the current strain also has genes in common with bird flu

[02:29:44.980 --> 02:29:50.820]
And human flu and as you might guess this is not a good time to be a pig farmer even though you can't get

[02:29:50.820 --> 02:29:51.540]
Did she say mutants?

[02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:56.880]
Pig farmers face falling prices and an uncertainty starting about that one

[02:29:56.880 --> 02:30:01.700]
I was dosed. I've seen an affiliate KXTA visited a Texas pig farm. I don't want to see that

[02:30:02.260 --> 02:30:04.380]
Yeah, do you ever get behind a pig truck on a highway?

[02:30:05.940 --> 02:30:07.340]
We're next to it. Okay

[02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:09.400]
and

[02:30:10.620 --> 02:30:16.060]
It's maybe your the aroma that comes from a pig truck is enough. It's enough to make sure it's wound very stinky

[02:30:16.720 --> 02:30:20.940]
It's enough to make you pull off to the side of the road and just get out and puke your guts on

[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:27.920]
God it's enough to make you give up bratwurst almost not me though. I love my brats

[02:30:28.680 --> 02:30:33.280]
Cliff and Kendall sent this he says have you ever watched the show dirty jobs in micro on the Discovery Channel

[02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:36.820]
Not only never watched it never heard of it. Did you ever hear of it dirty jobs? No

[02:30:37.940 --> 02:30:40.180]
That's what we got yeah, we got a dirty job

[02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:42.180]
But somebody's got to do it

[02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:46.060]
The show takes you on a tour of the dirtiest most disgusting jobs in existence

[02:30:46.660 --> 02:30:50.560]
The one show I thought was the most disgusting was death scene cleanup special

[02:30:52.660 --> 02:30:58.280]
These are cleanup crews with specializing cleaning and disinfecting murder suicide or found body scenes

[02:30:59.860 --> 02:31:04.100]
Can you imagine when they find a body that's been like when some of these old people live alone you know they die?

[02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:09.680]
Yeah, and nobody finds them for like weeks like Dr. Laura's mom and melted into the carpet

[02:31:11.220 --> 02:31:15.560]
She melted in the carpet they had to remove the carpet to remove the carcass

[02:31:16.180 --> 02:31:22.660]
Really yeah, she melted into it. She was fused with it. They could know me over from it her and the carpet were one

[02:31:25.180 --> 02:31:25.700]
Wow

[02:31:26.360 --> 02:31:32.420]
These guys cleaned brains off the ceiling walls along with blood and riding corpses that were discovered weeks after the death talk about gross

[02:31:32.420 --> 02:31:36.500]
Says Piff and Kendall. I'll take your word for it. I will not be watching dirtiest jobs with micro

[02:31:36.500 --> 02:31:38.320]
I'm discovery channel or anywhere else

[02:31:39.140 --> 02:31:43.800]
Got another dead guy that nobody avert of the Dow is down about 10 points. Nothing dramatic yet

[02:31:43.800 --> 02:31:44.640]
yet

[02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:48.200]
Pigs are disgusting

[02:31:49.240 --> 02:31:51.860]
Yeah, and we make fun of this but they're yummy

[02:31:52.520 --> 02:31:55.680]
Oh pork is delicious pork chops and brought worse man

[02:31:56.600 --> 02:32:00.060]
Or like Donna Bob's used to and Wayne Arles got the Rochester Whitehunts

[02:32:00.060 --> 02:32:00.500]
I

[02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:04.240]
Speaking of Wayne Arles by the way don't tell that story on the air

[02:32:05.480 --> 02:32:08.840]
What story? Oh, I never sent you a copy of that email. I got

[02:32:09.980 --> 02:32:11.440]
No good good

[02:32:12.740 --> 02:32:14.820]
It was less than um complimentary

[02:32:16.140 --> 02:32:17.300]
In fact, it was

[02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:22.420]
devastating to say the least Peter Dennis is dead at 75

[02:32:23.940 --> 02:32:26.480]
British actor made a career of one man pool readings

[02:32:27.020 --> 02:32:29.460]
Poo readings winning the poo oh

[02:32:31.540 --> 02:32:32.800]
Poo readings. Oh

[02:32:34.060 --> 02:32:36.080]
Isn't that a cute little brown pig oh

[02:32:36.900 --> 02:32:40.280]
Gross they're showing all these different kinds of pigs. I don't want to see him pick this one roast me out

[02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:44.340]
They're nauseating look at aren't they not really the kind of cute you ever watch Oprah

[02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:52.540]
British actor Peter Dennis saw his first stage play at 29 and knew immediately if not sooner. He wanted to act

[02:32:54.240 --> 02:33:00.180]
After an introduction to the works of a million he later specialized in them and bristle that the notion that they were just for children

[02:33:00.800 --> 02:33:02.740]
He performed his show bother

[02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:07.100]
Name for a favorite exclamation by the a mil character milled character in more than

[02:33:07.100 --> 02:33:12.580]
A hundred venues and the U.S. in Europe including Hollywood blowing with Westminster palace

[02:33:14.220 --> 02:33:17.560]
He was 75 and now he's dead

[02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:21.600]
Dennis was 36 before we discovered the denizens of the hundred acre wood

[02:33:22.100 --> 02:33:26.800]
Hundred acre wood when a girlfriend took him to a London exhibit of the works of mill illustrator Ernest Shepard

[02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:31.160]
With a convert zeal Dennis was soon essentially performing mill for dinner guests

[02:33:32.420 --> 02:33:34.980]
To mark Poo's 50th birthday in 1976

[02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:40.200]
Dennis gave an impromptu late-night reading at Cambridge University and was stunned to perform before a packed house

[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:40.960]
Oh

[02:33:42.140 --> 02:33:44.900]
Just like we were stunned to get those numbers this morning stunned

[02:33:45.540 --> 02:33:45.900]
I

[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:50.900]
Told you we were gonna do pretty good tonight. Yes, you did this because we had a couple of pretty good months going in

[02:33:52.420 --> 02:33:55.660]
His show bother named for a favorite exclamation by Poo was born

[02:33:57.240 --> 02:33:57.600]
And

[02:33:57.600 --> 02:34:04.100]
In addition to winning the Poo 1926 Dennis drew from the house at Poo Corner and the poetry when we were young and now we are six

[02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:08.280]
Just as mill had the actor bristle that the notion that the books were aimed at children

[02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:12.380]
Poo and his friends in the forest show the whole of humanity told the tapetribune in

[02:34:12.380 --> 02:34:19.560]
1997 when the show debuted in the US in 1986 at stage Lee Strasbourg in West Hollywood the times called it

[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:22.240]
Wimsically absurd

[02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:27.280]
Charming and Wimpshire Wimpshire was charming. Yeah

[02:34:27.900 --> 02:34:28.560]
Poo's boring

[02:34:29.220 --> 02:34:35.140]
Because you boring. Yeah actor Charlton Heston became a friend after seeing bothering 87 at the corner of theater West Hollywood

[02:34:36.040 --> 02:34:40.060]
Heston introduced himself backstage by saying I'm Tigger and this is my wife Piglet

[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:46.220]
Our art there was Moses reflected my mirror Peter Dennis said in the times he wrecked his arms around me said

[02:34:46.220 --> 02:34:50.880]
It was the most wonderful evening. He ever spent the theater. How do you like that? He wrapped his arms and legs around him

[02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:54.000]
I wonder if he had his peace on him

[02:34:55.140 --> 02:34:59.480]
For my cold dead hands wasn't it great that he said that for my cold dead hands and now he didn't cold

[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:02.260]
Chuck Heston so really it isn't really cold

[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:06.120]
The Dow's down eight points nothing nothing get excited about

[02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:11.400]
And it says they're on CNN swine flu don't panic. I think they probably getting like a real chewing out

[02:35:13.300 --> 02:35:17.060]
From people who said that they're like trying to get everybody whipped up into a frenzy and that they're

[02:35:17.060 --> 02:35:21.280]
They're overkill is gonna cause people to like start doing all kinds of rash hysterical things

[02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:26.180]
Like where mass not to work the economy either you don't get everybody to stay home or lock themselves inside

[02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:30.920]
Not good. We already have really bad economic situation closed classroom. It's a different thing

[02:35:31.860 --> 02:35:35.720]
Okay, we heard this from the acting Joe Biden said but a beat but a boot but about you know Joe

[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:40.520]
He's got that hoofin mouth disease some people I have swine flu disease. He's got hoofin mouth

[02:35:43.020 --> 02:35:45.840]
Still got 51 certificates left. Oh, we got some emails on here

[02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:51.680]
And here's one with links

[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:53.760]
links

[02:35:54.700 --> 02:35:58.320]
To mr. Rogers I don't do links

[02:35:58.940 --> 02:36:02.680]
But nevertheless I'll print it out when it doubt print it out

[02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:09.080]
I don't do links. I don't open attachments, but you people keep sending him air every single day air every day

[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:11.360]
In fact, this one he sent me twice just to make sure

[02:36:13.420 --> 02:36:15.640]
Just to make sure that I wouldn't open it and I won't

[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:24.440]
Kelly McGillis confirms gay rumors who's Kelly McGillis actress top gun star

[02:36:24.940 --> 02:36:28.480]

I'm excited considering a lucrative they come direct

[02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:10.380]
If you want to know and will save you from shutting that transmitted to ground

[02:37:11.300 --> 02:37:12.920]
Why that's easy

[02:37:15.220 --> 02:37:15.660]
Sure

[02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:31.440]

[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:27.320]
The green arrows back on there. Thrilled. We don't want no red arrow. Remember little arrows?

[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:32.780]
What was it called? Leapily and little arrows. I don't know. It's had the wrong name of the song.

[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:40.820]
Something arrows. Leapily, you know, got it? Looking. Boy, you're slipping man in your old age.

[02:38:41.260 --> 02:38:46.500]
Hey, don't say that so hastily. It might not be a real song. Leapily, how do you spell Leapy?

[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:55.020]
L-E-A-P-Y. How else would you spell Leapy? L-E-E. L-I-P-Y. Leapy? He leapy. I don't think I have any Leapy.

[02:38:55.020 --> 02:39:01.680]
Well, that would be the only one. Don't worry about it. It's not a good song. Cliff and Kendall sends me this.

[02:39:01.860 --> 02:39:07.840]
Kelly McGillis confirms gay rumors. It's the sound of a million middle-aged hearts breaking.

[02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:13.240]
Top Gun star Kelly McGillis, otherwise known as the Boyhood Crush of anyone with a beating heart in 1986,

[02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:19.700]
has confirmed long-standing rumors that she is a lesbian. She's a lesbian. Now, she wanted those pasty

[02:39:19.700 --> 02:39:25.500]
lesbians like Rachel Maddow and Ellen DeGenerate. She has a pretty face, but she doesn't think she

[02:39:25.500 --> 02:39:30.420]
will make up. Yeah, every time I've seen her. She's not like Manly and stuff like that. It

[02:39:30.420 --> 02:39:37.240]
doesn't surprise me how's that. She always likes a pretty woman. Oh, I had some radar online reports.

[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:41.720]
McGillis said, I'm done with the man thing. I did that. I need to move on in life. That's another

[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:45.640]
part of being true to yourself. That's been a challenge for me personally. She said, she's done with

[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:54.180]
the man thing, Mr. Man. Mr. Man. I think accepting being homosexual, that was an ongoing process from the

[02:39:54.180 --> 02:39:59.320]
time I was about 12, she had it. I had a lot of things that happened that convinced me that God was punishing me for

[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:06.140]
being gay. That was a hard process. Maybe that's why I wound up working for Joe Bell. God is punishing me for

[02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:11.860]
being gay. Think? Maybe. McGillis has two daughters from a marriage to Fred Tillman. The couple divorced in

[02:40:11.860 --> 02:40:19.060]
2002. The actress has repeatedly denied sexual, speculation about her sexual about him the past. That's bad. He's

[02:40:19.060 --> 02:40:28.840]
repeatedly denied it. Now, all of a sudden, oh, guess what? I'm a guy. Dike lesbian. Why deny it? Why not just keep mum? Right?

[02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:36.700]
Like Tommy Cruz. Hey, Tommy, you can. You know, I watched Matt Damon. I've seen that movie. The

[02:40:36.700 --> 02:40:42.060]
talented Mr. Ripley about 400 times. Every time it comes on, I'm forced to watch at least part of it. And I don't

[02:40:42.060 --> 02:40:50.120]
know. I mean, I know what's his name? Matt Damon is a good actor. But he plays the gay with such ease, man. He

[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:56.660]
just. To ease. Lames into it. You know what I'm saying? I don't think he's acting much of a wrong. What?

[02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:01.100]
Too much of a natural, you think? He's married and has. I'm sure a very manly penis, but nevertheless.

[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:11.480]
L sends me a thing here. Randy Rhodes returns to radio on more than 100 stations. Al. But then and then it says

[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:18.240]
subject and then it goes on this thing about war crimes by Bush and training with a petition. I say, Neil,

[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:22.160]
thank you again for 30 years of entertaining radio, sincerely. Al, but what does this have to do with Randy?

[02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:27.640]
We turning on more than 100 stations to say. Not in South Florida, though. That's the rumor we have that I would

[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:32.960]
be not going to put her on. They don't think she's a good fit with their Nazi lineup with Jimmy Stifelidic and

[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:41.800]
Rush and Glenn Dreck. And what's his name? The Schmidt Meister. So I don't know how to. In

[02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:46.480]
obscure America, of course, they're along gone sports. Well, they're going to do some kind of a number.

[02:41:46.500 --> 02:41:49.540]
Let me tell you we're doing some kind of a number in some parts like nighttime.

[02:41:53.020 --> 02:42:00.200]
Cannot wait. I'm done just on pins and needles about those hourlies. Joe Rose had a good book. We had a

[02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:07.020]
really rock saw. I would say rock solid. Yeah. First in a long time under the current regime in spite of this

[02:42:07.020 --> 02:42:18.040]
regime. Leave me not thanks to them in spite of them. Every roadblock, every deterrent to success, every

[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:23.320]
negative vibe. See that. That's the thing that really bugs me negative vibes. I mean, what kind of

[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:27.920]
management style is that? I don't know. I mean, somebody once told me you can't complain about the morale in

[02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:36.940]
this place because there is no who told you that you was. Somebody said that. I don't know. Low morale. But now after this

[02:42:36.940 --> 02:42:43.940]
book comes out, I bet you the runner, I'll say, Oh, we did great. We right? Yeah. They did it. They did it.

[02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:51.200]
Not us, not me and certainly not you. Oh, I know. Because you you're always a torpedoing the numbers. There's no question.

[02:42:52.780 --> 02:42:56.200]
Torpedo man. Now that would you should have had that on the pull-ed day when you were looking for your nickname.

[02:42:56.580 --> 02:43:05.600]
Torpedo man. DJ torpedo. Now, who was it that used to say that? That's too late to change it. Greg Reed. Greg Reed. He said, I torpedoed the ratings.

[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:11.620]
When I filled in for you this summer that I had an eight to with tapes. Everybody else had really sucky numbers. The only

[02:43:11.620 --> 02:43:19.140]
number that we had was this show. But I tore Pedoed the radio station. He hated you. I know. Now that would be a good

[02:43:19.140 --> 02:43:23.080]
pull question. Who hated George Moore? Greg Reed or Joe Bell? I think it's the same.

[02:43:42.420 --> 02:43:51.340]
About a girl called Sifle Sso. Had a bug and ran it around.

[02:43:52.620 --> 02:43:58.340]
Gave it to every guy in town. You're fairing.

[02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:28.000]
Oh, I shouldn't order from the spot on the head. I didn't know with the urine and the drugs.

[02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:36.920]
I bought a bowl always be where you. So stay away from a Sifle Sso. Have a turquoise I'm sure to see no signs.

[02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:42.740]
No sense of a friend of mine. You got infected now I've got it too.

[02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:49.680]
So keep away from a Sifle Sso. Yeah. Hey, keep away from that girl.

[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:55.460]
Hope that I'm still in for good now. Keep away from soup.

[02:44:57.520 --> 02:45:05.560]
She likes to sleep around. Yeah, even did it with my bad shit house. We didn't know that I started to call.

[02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:12.240]
Now I'm afraid it's falling off. Here's the moral story from a guy who knows.

[02:45:12.780 --> 02:45:18.300]
He used to have a hoes when his fungus froze and scared me for all that she ever knew.

[02:45:18.780 --> 02:45:28.260]
I keep away from a Sifle Sso. Yeah. Keep away from that girl. I don't know what to do now. Bye.
