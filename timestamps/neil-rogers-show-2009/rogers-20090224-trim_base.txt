garden in your pants hmm yeah I got one of blows

[00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.370]

[00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.430]
chuck and the subject Jeffrey Donovan question mark

[00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.910]
yet question mark is right or the ugliest guys I've ever seen in my life

[00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.850]
and that takes in a lot of territory it says my wife seems to have similar

[00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.270]
taste in men as you do no she does not her latest is Jeffrey Donovan he's

[00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.210]
currently in a show called burn notice on USA he has

[00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.810]
gruesome and there's a picture here with his shirt off and I'm praying from

[00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.930]
to put some clothes back on starting with a bag over his head

[00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.870]
he may be old news to you now he hasn't any news to me I never heard of him and I

[00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.090]
wish I hadn't seen these pictures just thought if I could I'd see if I could

[00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.550]
make your day oh keep up the good work oh this is chuck and Chicago I thought

[00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.750]
was like a real person I thought with an IQ larger than his thumbnail

[00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.110]
keep up the good work just thought I'd see if I could make your day and here's

[00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:10.470]
two pictures one shirtless and one just gross oh Jeffrey Donovan yeah that's

[00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.850]
I got the hot for Jeff he may be old news to you and I actually email these

[00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.870]
to afford them to George yeah so you get an idea of what bad taste these people have got

[00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.610]
stick to the ladies chuck you wouldn't recognize a good looking guy if he beat you on the ass

[00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.950]
oh remember he said it was his wife well yeah just like Lee jay cobs said oh I lied it was for my

[00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.470]
day it wasn't for my daughter was for me yeah yeah Chuck's got the hot for Jeffrey Donovan

[00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.970]
burn notice never heard of the show don't watch USA Network never heard of this guy and oh

[00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.930]
oh Chuck and Chicago just lost all the points because ordinarily when he sends emails he's got

[00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.190]
something to say you know he's like a a real person but he's not here's the pull from

[00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.290]
yesterday how many days did you listen to George while you was on vacation 1113 votes boy

[00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:10.710]
they sure got whipped up about that that's a lot of votes sure 1113 friggin vote by the way I

[00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.990]
apologize in advance for the poll today it blows so Charlie V sudo inlectual piece of crap hey Charlie

[00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.750]
I got news for him and you need some assistance you need help and I need even I need even more help

[00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:31.250]
for a ticket at pole and using it what are you most admire about Abe Lincoln oh I think paper

[00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.190]
or plastic is a better than this coming up next what you admire most about Abe Lincoln the fact

[00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.010]
that he's still dead he's not trying to make a comeback anyway here's the ideal how many days did

[00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.710]
you listen to George while Neil was on vacation are you kidding none of them 530 47.6% almost half

[00:05:49.710 --> 00:06:00.150]
wow are you kidding all of them 330 29.6% dropped under 30 not good two days 120

[00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:08.430]
three days 86 four days only 47 are you kidding none of them 530 that's that's a shot

[00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:18.510]
that's a shot across the bow yeah firing a shot across the bow so many stupid people so

[00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.510]
many idiotic sayings and so little time I was thinking about some stupid saying over the weekend

[00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.930]
I forgot what it was was so stupid where did it come to the dead no I don't do that

[00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:37.250]
I hear's the one about your pre-puse really don't George is growing this it's from Sam James

[00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:44.150]
subject a garden in George's pants yeah George is growing an uncircumcised seed pod in this

[00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.490]
crotch all girls have talked to on this were grossed out and pray when they're unzipping a fly

[00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.850]
they don't have a pile of smegmas macning them in the face well Sam I hate to break the news to you

[00:06:52.850 --> 00:07:00.070]
but around the world uncircumcised outweighs circumcised by like a zillion to one right so evidently

[00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.070]
the females of the world must be getting grossed out very regular sure right a little background it says

[00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:11.770]
pomosis note that the foreskin pre-puse will not retract off the glands during erection this is called

[00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:17.270]
pomosis after infancy the foreskin should be loosened up to be drawn backs west to completely

[00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.110]
expose the whole glands penis head and to be pulled forward again without pain or difficulty in the

[00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.430]
mature youth this action should be possible with the penis erect if it cannot be retracted at all

[00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:33.470]
pomosis washing is not possible and smegma accumulates oh pomosis and adults also make sexual

[00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.430]
undercourse on satisfactory and load deposition of semen in the vagina as semen is often deposited

[00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:44.670]
inside the pre-puse may cause infertility don't need a rubber occasionally the opening becomes so

[00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:50.530]
small even urinating becomes difficult if a tight pre-puse is forcibly drawn back e.g. during

[00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.470]
intercourse it may become trapped behind the glands and incapable of being pulled forward again

[00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:00.550]
pyrophimosus in this painful condition the foreskin strangulates the glands and emergency treatment

[00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:06.090]
is necessary or just get a rusty razor blades good pomosis may follow injury or inflammation or

[00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:12.550]
it may be a development developmental abnormality we get in tongue-tied parents are often surprised

[00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.950]
to learn that their teenage or needs a circumcision having been assured he was perfectly normal earlier

[00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.590]
this explanation is that before the puberty the opening of the pre-puse was large enough for a lot

[00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:26.010]
of the glands to pass through but during the rapid growth of the penis after puberty only that part

[00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:30.750]
of the foreskin which covers the glands enlarges and consequence the tip of the pre-puse which lies

[00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:36.030]
beyond the glands does not grow the opening stays the same size and the much enlarged glands will

[00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.790]
no longer pass through and I'm sure there was much more to this but that's all I got right thank

[00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:44.690]
God I really appreciate all the gardener's gorgeous pants all but thank you Sam out of worry about

[00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:50.550]
whatever is in his own pants which perhaps ain't much thanks Sam I'm doing just fine yeah there you

[00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:55.790]
go a garden in your pants he only with okay let's take a look at that current poll if we must

[00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:05.390]
Charlie B needs to be what hey listen quartered that Tony he's there's a no I'm not arguing that

[00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:11.630]
point but what else do we have as far as poll contributors well let's see I got a whole bunch

[00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:20.350]
of money really pulse the job one from a dog now let me see is this a poll oh no this is about

[00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:26.350]
the I waited that about the a former high school we don't care about that truckers like the rest of

[00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:31.490]
the Simulans who think they know what good looks are stuck in Weston looking for a reach around good

[00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:39.830]
show you enjoy and it's as much as go to the playoffs eight years later well better late than ever

[00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:46.650]
because they make believe sure ain't code no playoffs and probably neither are that ranges ranges

[00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.910]
range of strangers oh here's a private message from Hassan Mohammed well I guess I can

[00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:57.950]
delete that really hey you might have won a lottery come on though yeah uh-huh Hassan private message

[00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:04.310]
just amazing the world is so full of this craft by the way the market is let's see oh they

[00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:22.390]
balls the co-homes to keep giving us that was up thirty f three point I mean not nothing exciting but

[00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.610]

this one and the fake that one and whatever else and all the spy reports at sea

[00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.310]
haven't heard from Maria though it's a buying opportunity baby the market is down in the toilet

[00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:46.630]
no sell sell sell don't don't get involved in the first place that's my best advice just like

[00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:53.010]
with the slots don't get involved in the first place you got it I got it good idea I won't

[00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:59.690]

us all down the river the american life we love and know is dying a slow death we're all in denial

[00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:24.870]
concentrate and diluted it in a big five gallon bucket called the global economy and now the

[00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.970]
middle class lives in India we're all screwed Obama's just a puppet he went to central casting and

[00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:17.950]
said Rosenberg on the other hand had the actual editor of the magazine and thanked him for

[00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:21.990]
putting him on it after he complained last year for never being on it he didn't make the top

[00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:25.790]
hundred by the way it was like i don't know what he was however the second half of the interview

[00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:30.670]
focused on you how could you put a husband like the margins on your list he hasn't been relevant

[00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:36.150]
for ten years why would you decide to give him a lifetime membership on a list i've been telling

[00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:39.530]
you the guy behind the emails from seven ninety is Rosenberg why else would you devote he would

[00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:43.910]
devote an interview to bash you why you should focus on yourself making the top hundred for the

[00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:47.510]
first time unless you're obsessed he has the right personality type addictive and delusional

[00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:51.470]
what did you or George do to him we didn't do nothing anymore we don't care about him

[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:54.020]
ps are you taking calls from arch one no

[00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:00.700]
nor do i care what he's talking about me bashing me is there a pastime over there and bash

an industry farce jealousy is a very very bad attribute it's not an attribute a bad what

[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:21.160]
would you call it trait trait very good trait as in trader yeah trader don't hate her trader

[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:27.280]

[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:31.540]
have one i was number fifteen on their list i still didn't care about it because it's a farce

[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:36.940]
it was invented by a bunch gerry Williams and a bunch of ecotistical talk guys invented that thing

[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:46.040]
and that's what it's all about popularity contest oh yeah it's fat Tuesday how come the beast is

[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:52.240]
nonsense stuntman my because i'm here in Georgia's here we don't need the beast on here oh here's

[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:59.760]
one from a need of Brian the fake and eat a Brian this is the first

[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:07.560]
now what did you send me this thing about bones yes oh or the fake George did actually

[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:13.420]
make no bones about it and tells well i guess for what it's worth you know you know oh my god

[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:19.680]
why what's that bowl soup next to it i don't know there's a picture of a bull of our I know why

[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:29.440]
maybe it's bone soup yeah i know what that is never heard or called that before though but i

[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:35.040]
know what that is okay let's see the fake and eat a Brian says first off let me say this is

[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.440]
just another email ripping George relatively compared to what else is on there in this horrible

[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:44.060]
radio market he's the best thing but obviously that's not saying much see every time i go on vacation

[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:48.660]
in u-ron or during the summertime this is all they got to write about George is great George sucks

[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:52.920]
George's uh you know yeah bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap the same old crap

[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:57.120]
the thing about George is that he tries to copy your style of complaining about everything but it

[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:02.220]
doesn't work i never got the feeling that you try to copy anything i know i i can't and don't try

[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:07.300]
when you're upset about something in life you do something about it like move to Canada etc

[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:10.520]
George on the other hand is complaining about the same stuff for years uh-huh

[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.680]
George doesn't have the financial ability or wherewithal to do what he would like to do

[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:19.380]
that that goes what i say it up crap i'm lucky it's held that i did have and i did uh do the thing

[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:23.560]
and i'm here for love of god if he hates his wife and kids so much who said he hates his

does he get divorced or go to a counselor George be a man take charge of your family what do you get

[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:37.720]

[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:41.320]
guidance and leadership and since you're obviously not providing it your wife has no choice but

[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:45.260]
to become the head of the household uh-huh George you're looking sound like a pathetic loser

[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:49.600]

torch it god is that good that that's just to die for but nevertheless see there we go with the

[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.760]
food again say and kathy says i think the reason we're having trouble remembering the last free

[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:43.140]
visas that have been so many months ago you announced to win these singles giveaway downtown for

[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:51.380]
lauderdale and hi who is in your park remember that no i do then it was the free grand

[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:55.680]
sign breakfast at denny see it was free i told you don't you know anything apparently not

[01:09:56.100 --> 01:10:00.140]
then it was the quarter pounder for a quarter of mcdonalds and mcd's i don't like quarter

[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:06.300]
pounders i do love the double cheeseburgers though don't hold the cheese give me a double cheeseburger

[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:11.740]
hold the cheese i mean that is it possible that there could be anybody dumber in the universe than that

[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:15.760]
you know that people used to order that when i worked at burger king order what cheeseburgers

[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.480]
without the cheese and i didn't know if there were being funny or just stupid or stupid yeah

[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:30.480]
let me have a cheater that's like saying let me have a ham and cheese sandwich with no bread yeah

[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:40.540]
hold the cheese mm-hmm that i think that goes back to that article about the pre-puse

[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:46.340]
and cathy system info about the i-hop pancake giveaway i was in there and saw the post of the

[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:51.120]
week before and they will give you the pancakes for free but they say they would like you to

[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:56.980]
consider giving to a children's charity instead of paying for the pancakes i'm sorry it says i

[01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:00.040]
guess there are some people that can refuse a request like that yeah i'm sure there are

[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.380]
because if somebody tells me they're giving me something for free don't give me the old bait and

[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:10.820]
swish i hop either it's for free or it's not for free don't start huddling me for some charity

[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.740]
so that instead of getting for free i still got to reach into my wallet and pay out

[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:21.500]
that's not for free you know what that reminds me of what that reminds me of my trips to what was

[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:25.520]
that what's the casino and agro falls i was raving about until i lost my ass there many times

[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:32.600]
falls view i see and of course because i got the players card and they were like following me around

[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:36.580]
and on the card they can monitor and see how much you're playing and they saw that i was a big loser

[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:43.220]
i mean spender and so then they then they give you the room and the meals for free right well don't

[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:46.660]
tell me it's for free when you're going to guarantee i'm going to lose five six seven grand for the

[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:55.040]
weekend you know that that free for our five thousand that's falls view free for a few grand whatever

[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:05.520]
we can shake out of your wallet that's falls view free is free period no charge no tip no nothing

[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:11.580]
free if it cost me money that's not free right right although i would think that even the cheapest

[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:16.620]
bastards in the world even their frogs i doubt that would have tipped at um denys if they got the

[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:23.140]
free breakfast no no no no no not even done

[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:34.520]
okay well here here's another conflicting report about though this is good we got into a big

[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:39.260]
topic here at denys like i said if they gave me the food if they paid me to go in there i don't want

[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:43.760]
it and there's one like two blocks from my house down there mm-hmm

[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:33.340]
somebody could like spell correctly who could put a sentence together like 10 to 20

[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:39.380]
Cuban George says you were absolutely correct on the denys free grandstein breakfast after the

[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:45.920]
super bowl they tried to make me pay $299 for the breakfast i refused and stated i didn't have any

[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:52.160]

[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:56.040]

[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.700]
entertaining unless of course he's talking about religion and the theory of evolution

[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:13.160]
he's very knowledgeable about that stuff but he can't do 20 hours a week on that subject why not

[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:19.240]

yeah you ever smell curry sure and you like it and and small doses as part of a recipe or something

[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:21.180]
all there is to a particular dish like curry this or curry oh it just permeates the hallway

[01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:26.300]
and the walls and the ceiling and the carpeting and if you do get it like on your fingers or

[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:30.520]

[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.600]
talk to me about well you're up there in Toronto with all that euro trash and i'd get upset about

[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:20.900]
that because like where i visited europe like in uh Berlin and cologne yeah room although there's

[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:26.400]
plenty of trash in room believe me but i don't know i just encountered people that although

[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:34.440]
empty and is certainly plenty of traction at city wow but i just uh took uh exception because i

[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:40.400]
like europe a lot but oh the people from eastern europe i guess maybe they have an allergy to soap

[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:45.060]
you don't ask them whether it's soap or body wash because the the ants will be none of the above

[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:52.880]

[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:39.040]
table right you think i would actually pay to go watch bill marmia you tell me it's pretty good

[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:44.380]
and i'm sure it is it's got some good parts and it's got its moments but unfortunately it's

[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:49.120]
like an inconvenient truth it was fine except that al Gore was in it's a very very uh good

[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:54.880]
comparison and i think religious will be the same for me i can't stand bill mar can't

[01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:00.740]
out stand in i can't stomach him he is the torpheus thing on it even worse than Robert the

[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:06.880]
grim reaper the lord of the board even torpier than that they don't come much torpier than Robert

[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:13.360]
the lord of the board room or grim reaper he eyed uh-huh how's Kenny walk you doing is he still

[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:17.580]
reading liner cards on the coaster whatever he's doing far as i know good buddies with joe bell

[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:22.360]
that's why he got that morning gig oh god the kenny and blow morning show

[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:29.860]
if there's been a worse show in a history of this industry i i don't know what it is

[01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:36.280]
the square table gay or not gay then that whole business oh i think that old uh that old first

[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:39.960]
team incarnation with Ron hersy i think that might have been the worst really

[01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:45.980]
part of compare since i didn't listen either one oh you didn't even listen to the original

[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:50.380]
our worst team with me foe and joe and the guilty only incidentally here in the halls you know

[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:54.240]
didn't hear them doing all their live spots in every break i heard that and then belly

[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.480]
aching about how long the breaks were i that that was always puzzled me you know

[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.960]
you have three guys on the show and they're all doing every break they're all doing a live

[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:04.400]
spot for a minute and a half and then plus the recorded commercials and so they're doing like

[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.280]
nine and ten minute breaks and have no length of listenership and they're belly aching about

[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:12.360]
it but they're doing all these spots and now joe just forgot about the belly aching part now

[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:16.900]
all he does is spots and interviews with people and everybody hates like Alex Marvez and

[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:22.840]
Drew Rosenstein house crans shorts bird off to Lasos

[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:15.340]

[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:24.300]

[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:30.120]
it's my kind of race

[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.980]
I'm just naturally higher

[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:46.440]
guess what,ales like my own back yard

[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:57.000]
a heart attack

[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:02.360]
Who is the largest low-nast call?

[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:07.640]
And the 51st running of the Daytona 5100 going to Maccensit

[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:09.880]
in his route, Benway Ford.

[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:11.780]
Oh, by the way, speaking of an asphalt,

[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:13.600]
Raphael Nydell's got a girlfriend.

[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:14.540]
Who?

[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:18.780]
That the very strange Spanish tennis player, Raphael Nydell.

[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:19.780]
I don't know if that is.

[01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:20.580]
Yeah, you do.

[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:23.140]
I don't know if you saw him, you'd know who he was.

[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:23.720]
He's strange.

[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:24.400]
That's fine.

[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:25.660]
I don't know who that is.

[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.480]
And if we done that poll, I guess we have

[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.660]
about strangers, people he should have been on it.

[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:30.240]
He's strange.

[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:33.960]
Raphael Nydell, he's Spanish.

[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:34.780]
OK.

[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:35.960]
That's a Spanish.

[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.800]
The Spanish don't eat curry or goat.

[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:39.760]
Do they eat goat?

[01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:40.760]
I don't know.

[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:41.740]
I don't think so.

[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:43.740]
When you've never been in Spain, have you ever been to Spain?

[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:44.540]
No, I have.

[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:45.220]
I've been in Madrid.

[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.020]
And it was just fine.

[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:47.580]
It was OK.

[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:49.660]
I don't remember the food.

[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:50.880]
It wasn't just, I don't know.

[01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.960]
It just doesn't stick out in my mind.

[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:55.160]
I guess it wasn't fish or foul.

[01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:56.860]
Maybe better not be.

[01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:02.000]
Do you want the sea bass or do you want the foul, guinea foul?

[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:02.760]
Oh, boy.

[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.820]
I sure miss those days flying.

[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:06.500]
What was that, Miquelie Verlain?

[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:07.780]
I don't know.

[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:08.500]
Martin Skier.

[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:09.800]
Martin Skier.

[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:14.560]
Yeah, it's a subsidiary of KLM, Martin Air.

[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:17.880]
And used to be, I don't know, maybe it still is.

[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:22.300]
You couldn't fly from Miami to Amsterdam other than direct, other than Martin Air.

[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:29.420]
You want the guinea foul, the curry horse ball goat, or, oh, jeez.

[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:31.200]
Horrible.

[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:34.580]
And didn't make any difference which one you chose because they all tasted the same anyway.

[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.580]
It used to be, you get some pretty good food on airlines.

[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:44.800]
Nowadays, it's pretty much all, and I still say, give me that menu from the shluppers back in coach

[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:47.660]
like the sub sandwiches or whatever they get to.

[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:47.860]

[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.560]
And I'll even pay extra for it.

[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:49.980]
I don't mind.

[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:53.360]
Even though you soaked me, you're just bled me dry to sit in Venice class.

[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:55.760]
But I'll still pay extra for like a meal I want to eat.

[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:59.260]
Maybe, you know, stick your head through that curtain there and say, hey, anybody want to trade me?

[01:29:59.380 --> 01:29:59.380]

[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:02.920]
Trade me, I'm going to have a good idea.

[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:07.920]
I wouldn't mind having like a little bag of, like, um, tomatoes.

[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.140]
I heard you had a little bag.

[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:14.300]
A little bag, a little, a tea bag of Doritos and like a little, uh, sub sandwich or something,

[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:15.140]
even from subway.

[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.400]
Even from subway, I would eat it.

[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:18.140]
Wow.

[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:22.800]
Well, that's saying a lot about that crap that they serve as food, especially on Scare Canada.

[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:26.960]
Oh, you want the salmon or the beef?

[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:31.780]
But, apparently, they're off tourists or Canada.

[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:32.920]
They're on the verge again.

[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:34.420]
They every year or two.

[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:36.140]
They like a red on the verge of going out of Venice.

[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:40.640]
And then because they have that monopoly, I guess it makes sense that they keep them in Venice.

[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:41.140]
I don't know.

[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:45.860]
All I know is that they they've been fine to me, but they just charge ridiculous fears.

[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:47.060]
I mean, ridiculous.

[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:51.580]
And a guy in my position can afford to look ridiculous.

[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:52.280]
Right.

[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:57.780]
To God says Mickey D's, it was by one of the regular price gets the next one for quarter quarter

[01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:58.260]
pounder.

[01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:58.980]
Remember that?

[01:30:59.420 --> 01:30:59.660]
Yes.

[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.480]
No, no matter what he would have written, you would have said yes.

[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:04.760]
And so would I, because I don't remember.

[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:10.360]
I don't and I don't care because I don't, I'm not into, um, big max.

[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.320]
I just like the right.

[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:13.000]
Special sauce.

[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:14.360]
That's special sauce.

[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:18.360]
It looks just like Barbara, but it smells like her.

[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:21.480]
Haven't played that in a long time.

[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:22.160]
Fetty Davis.

[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:22.800]
What is it called?

[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:24.300]
Betty Davis.

[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:25.460]
Uh, Barbara bushes eyes.

[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:26.280]
No, it's not.

[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:26.720]
It's not.

[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:27.940]
No, it is not.

[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:29.060]
Marty Feldman eyes.

[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:29.420]
Marty.

[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:33.640]
Keep reaching.

[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:37.140]
So anyway, you send me this thing about where that expression came from, make no bones about it.

[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:38.580]
Yeah, for what it's worth.

[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:43.340]
To state a fact in a way that allows no doubt to have no objection to origin.

[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:44.960]
Oh, this goes on forever.

[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:45.200]
Good.

[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.440]
This will kill at least a couple hours.

[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:52.360]
This is another one of those ancient phrases we accept with our mother's milk as an idiom,

[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:57.640]
but which seems quite strange when we later give it some thoughts.

[01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:01.560]
Strange like a Raphael Nadal strange.

[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:07.160]
When we're trying to convey that, uh, that we acknowledge or have no objection to something,

[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:09.720]
why bring bones into it?

[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:14.340]
Yeah, then bones, then bones, then dry bones.

[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:15.380]
They call me Mr. Bones.

[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:16.420]
That's right.

[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:18.740]
Mr. Interlocutor.

[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.600]
Just taking a little swing there.

[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:24.100]
It's alright.

[01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:24.780]
Don't choke.

[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:25.360]
Don't die.

[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:26.520]
I'm choking over.

[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:27.960]
Nobody there to hide like you if you do.

[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:28.880]
That's true.

[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:34.800]
It's been suggested that bones were dice, which were previously made from bone or still

[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:36.400]
called bones in gambling circles.

[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:42.540]
That explanation doesn't stand up to scrutiny to make no dice about it makes a little sense.

[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:47.940]
A 1542 translation of Erasmus' paraphrase of Luke.

[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.520]
He discussed the command given Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.

[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:56.200]
He wrote, he made no bones about it went to offer up his son.

[01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:58.040]
Yeah, that's your God.

[01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:58.380]
Okay.

[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.060]
Give your son as a human sacrifice.

[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:00.480]
Nice.

[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:01.860]
Nice going, off from.

[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:09.480]
Boy Erasmus wasn't noticed for his visit to the gaming tables in what Harley have

[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:09.700]
used.

[01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:11.960]
Bending terminology to discuss a biblical test.

[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:13.960]
I wonder if they have casinos back in those days.

[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:14.860]
Think?

[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:15.880]
Good question.

[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.320]
They probably just gambled out in the street.

[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.560]
What's the origin of dice I wonder?

[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:22.320]
Just what you heard.

[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:23.100]
No dice.

[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:24.720]
Like that.

[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:25.820]
They made them out of knuckle bones.

[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:29.920]
The actual source of this phrase is closer to home and hearth.

[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:34.140]
In 15th century England, if somebody wanted to express their dissatisfaction with something,

[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:35.900]
they didn't make bones about it.

[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.280]
They used the original form of the phrase.

[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:40.600]
I found bones in it.

[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.720]
This is a reference to the unwelcome discovery of bones in soup.

[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:46.880]
Bones equals bad.

[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:48.400]
No bones equals good.

[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:52.260]
You found no bones in your mirror to be able to swallow with any difficulty or objection.

[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:58.160]
I found bones in it in my curry and my goat and my curry.

[01:33:58.160 --> 01:33:59.620]
That one likes bony soup.

[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:04.960]
Even like in some kind of like a chowder.

[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:07.760]
Every now and then you'll find like a little piece of shell or something.

[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:12.440]
And then of course the best thing to do is pretend you're choking death on it and sue

[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:13.080]
the hell out of them.

[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:18.460]
The earliest I tasted the phrase in print comes from the past in letters which include

[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:23.100]
a collection of texts relating to a dispute between past and the family of the Norfolk

[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:24.820]
soldier, Sir John Fasdolf.

[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:30.460]
Fast off was incidentally the source of the character Sir John Falsdolf in Shakespeare's

[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:37.700]
Henry IV as if in the past in letters the context of which the litigants are finally accepting

[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:43.020]
a verdict from the objection past it includes in the line and find and find that time no

[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:44.020]
bones in the matter.

[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:45.780]
What?

[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:48.860]
In other words, in found that time no bones in the matter.

[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:51.800]
Making bones is usually expressed in the negative.

[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:56.340]
Isn't that what Mowgreen says?

[01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:58.580]
I was making my bones when you were dating cheerleaders.

[01:34:58.660 --> 01:34:59.520]
That's exactly what he says.

[01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:01.660]
That's exactly what Mowgreen said.

[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:05.680]
I was making my bones while you were dating cheerleaders.

[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:06.760]
What?

[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.120]
I made my bones.

[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:11.180]
That's what I do.

[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:12.780]
Well, let's hear it from the horses asked.

[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:14.260]
Do you know who I am?

[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:15.580]
I'm Mowgreen.

[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:18.460]
I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.

[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:22.040]
Not banging cheerleaders because that would have been given them too much credit.

[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:23.680]
The freighter was banging cocktail waiters.

[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:24.380]
It was two at a time.

[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:25.660]
The players couldn't get a drink at the table.

[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:28.580]
I had a straight name out.

[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:29.800]
Are you going to straighten out my brother?

[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:36.860]
Mikey.

[01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:43.780]
That was something Anthony almost went fishing with freighto, but they wouldn't let that happen.

[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:47.020]
You know, it would have been too gory for Anthony to see a freighter get a bullet from

[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:49.060]
a man in the back of the head.

[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:52.500]
And of course to show you those Hail Mary's don't work.

[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:54.060]
That's the one message of Godfather.

[01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:56.780]
You can say all the Hail Mary's didn't say enough of him.

[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:58.340]
How do you know it didn't work?

[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.000]
Maybe he went to heaven after he got shot in the head.

[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:00.360]
Yeah.

[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:04.280]
Maybe he's drinking that heavenly coffee now.

[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:06.780]
Chock full of nuts or heavenly hash.

[01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:09.280]
Making bones is usually expressed in the negative.

[01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:12.980]
There are rare occurrences of people being described as making bones about this or about that.

[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:17.300]
An early example comes from Richard Simpson's The School of Shakespeare 1878.

[01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:24.720]
Elizabeth was thus making huge bones of sending some 7,000 pounds over for the general purposes of the government of Ireland.

[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:29.520]
Make no bones about it is now rather archaic and heard less often than before.

[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:31.400]
That's why I brought it up because I'm archaic.

[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:32.480]
I'm old and I'm a fossil.

[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.420]
I'm an old fat old Jew fag.

[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:41.420]
It did return briefly during the 1980s and as an example of waiter I'll have a crocodile sandwich and make it snappy form of joke.

[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:44.580]
Waiter I'll have tomato soup and make no bones about it.

[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:47.220]
Link neatly back to the phrase is culinary origin.

[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:48.780]
Link neatly back.

[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:49.440]
Well, what is that?

[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:51.720]
Well, I see that's a picture of a bowl tomato soup.

[01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:53.400]
Make no bones about it.

[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.180]
How are you going to find bones in tomato soup?

[01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:57.400]
Tomato bones?

[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:00.520]
Maybe tomatoes got bones.

[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.280]
Tomato is a fruit, you know.

[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:02.980]
And bones.

[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:06.300]
Then bones, then bones, then grab bones.

[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:07.380]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:08.800]
Dry bones.

[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:11.140]
Don't know.

[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:15.420]
I know the dogs sure like their bones.

[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:24.520]
When I had the two dogs give me each a bone of similar, like a meat bone, you know.

[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:25.580]
Similar size.

[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:31.480]
And boy I turned in, neither one was satisfied with the one they had at the moment.

[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:32.860]
Like little kids with toys, you know.

[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:35.020]
I want your bone back.

[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:36.940]
And like that, really hostile.

[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:43.240]
And the golden retriever was usually very pleasant and friendly and not like that.

[01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:48.620]
But when it came to a bone, he wanted his own and the other dogs.

[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:53.160]
He wanted to choose his own bone.

[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:59.060]
Well, I think we just learned something very important.

[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:02.400]
Oh, by the way, John ZTR wrote yesterday last night.

[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.960]
I didn't write any negative emails to the show yesterday.

[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:08.820]
I should never reveal my identity because now any emails get credited to me.

[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:13.040]
Do we credit all the emails to John ZTR?

[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:15.520]
No, I think you're getting a little bit carried away with yourself there, John Boy.

[01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:17.480]
One more thing he says.

[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:18.160]
One more thing.

[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:22.700]
Just one more thing.

[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:26.260]
Just a radio show, John.

[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:29.960]
Just don't get, I mean, we appreciate all your good stuff and your bad stuff and your amusing stuff

[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:31.420]
and you're not at all funny at all stuff.

[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:35.880]
We appreciate all of it because Boy, it sure helps kill some really desperate time.

[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:36.680]
Oh, no.

[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:38.300]
You're a thing to me, old Roger.

[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:39.420]
Well, here we go again.

[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.140]
On 12, 18, I'm very disappointed.

[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.720]
I guess we did get the right answer on a spike.

[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:45.160]
Maybe that is the right answer.

[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:46.060]
And maybe it's not.

[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:46.360]
Right.

[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:47.860]
We need a third opinion though.

[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:50.180]
We need to clarification on how to loss us.

[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:55.460]
Jay and Cooper City says, stay away from the new slots for at least two months.

[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:58.060]
They won't pay out until they've made enough money to pay for the machine money.

[01:38:58.060 --> 01:39:00.260]
This happened to me at the Hard Rock in Hollywood.

[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.140]
Have a great day.

[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:02.840]
Well, I'll check it out.

[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:07.220]
At least two months without wheel of torture.

[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.880]
That's just more withdrawal than I think I can deal with.

[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:13.040]
You know what I mean?

[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:13.740]
What do you mean?

[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:15.240]
Can't deal with it.

[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:19.300]
Maybe I'll feed them and build up some of the big jackpots in the machine.

[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:20.020]
I doubt it though.

[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.580]
Rooster Chuchu's got a caustic email here long.

[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:25.920]
Rooster Chuchu.

[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:28.320]
Newsflash, even if it's a decade too late.

[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:33.520]
I started listening to you in the rest of the lineup at WIOD back in 1993.

[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:35.660]
I've listened to you on and off for 15 years.

[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:39.120]
Every time I came back to town from college, I would make sure to catch your show.

[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:41.980]
I've moved back permanently and been listening for a few months.

[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:43.060]
I have a newsflash for you.

[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:44.040]
It's not the same.

[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:45.720]
Oh, geez, no kidding.

[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:52.240]
In fact, it is sorely lacking the quick wit and acid taste that was your show's signature quality in the past.

[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.760]
I know that you're almost 70 years old.

[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:58.500]
It's unrealistic to expect you would have lost a little mental sharpness by this point.

[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.340]
But you have given up completely as surprising.

[01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:04.220]
I just heard you say you don't care.

[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:05.760]
Two or words have never been spoken.

[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:07.460]
You don't care about your audience anymore.

[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:11.220]
If you are truly carefree, why not take advice and instruction from listeners?

[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:13.140]
Oh, this is definitely what's his name?

[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:13.820]
John's ETR.

[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:18.820]
If you are truly carefree, why not take advice and instruction from listeners?

[01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:20.920]
Who only have the best intentions for you in your show?

[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:22.860]
And that's right, advice and instruction.

[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:27.580]
If it truly doesn't matter, why does it matter to you how the audience wants the show to go?

[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:31.660]
I know you mock people who try to contribute to the format and content structure of your show,

[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:37.320]
but you really shouldn't because these are all the same people who filled out arbitrage and diaries in support of your sponsors for years.

[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:43.820]
You have become very self-aggrandizing and confident in your success, and yet your ratings don't reflect that.

[01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:46.860]
I've never emailed or called your show at all this time.

[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:48.780]
This is the first time communicating with you.

[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:53.540]
I was one of those masses of people who would just enjoy your show and quiet amusement and never call.

[01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:58.500]
Now I've joined the majority of our audience of your audience and become annoyed and outraged at your attitude.

[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.580]
A annoyed and outraged at your attitude. How do you like that?

[01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:07.880]
Well, like most of your other emailers who you complain about, I feel compelled to redirect you to a more entertaining path.

[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:13.560]
Of course, it doesn't say what that more entertaining path might be, but it says redirect you to a more entertaining path.

[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:14.660]
I don't blame you solely.

[01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:22.240]
I think George deserves some blame. He'd lack the capacity or courage to point out to you when something is wrong or just plain BS.

[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:22.720]
Yeah.

[01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:27.400]
He's just waiting for you to die and take the money you leave behind. I'm not leaving him behind any money.

[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:31.040]
See, that's another thing I don't take instruction on.

[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:34.520]
Who I should leave my money to and what I should do in my will. I'm not leaving him any money.

[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.880]
Or a chicken neck. I'm not leaving him any money either.

[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:43.660]
He's just waiting for you to die and take the money you leave behind once remaining your good graces until then.

[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.820]
George, nobody cares about your wife or daughters and you're not hip or cool.

[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:47.920]
Oh, jeez.

[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.280]
It's time somebody stepped up to help you rescue your show.

[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:57.100]
You really want to end your career in a quiet sputter when nobody even noticing it or you want to write your ninth symphony and go out into blaze, but full of glory.

[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.240]
You'll be completing 30 years in this market next week. No, try 33 years in this market next week.

[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:04.060]
Use this opportunity for a new start.

[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:05.680]
Rooster Chuchu.

[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:09.800]
Yeah, who's the new John ZTR phony identity?

[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.000]
I mean, so obvious.

[01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:16.680]
See, these are only good if they're like a little bit dubious.

[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:22.020]
Like you really aren't positive that it's one of the regular chronics who isn't.

[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:26.040]
If you're truly carefree, why not take advice and instruction from listeners?

[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.740]
Yeah, what time is your show on Rooster Cogburn? You idiot. You jackass.

[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:32.420]
You fairy.

[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:36.080]
Here's one about your dogs.

[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:40.580]
It says, Neil, I haven't heard you talk about them recently until you just mentioned them. Did they die?

[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:43.400]
Yeah, they're still dead.

[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:47.360]
They've both been put to sleep, put out of their misery.

[01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:50.680]
One was like 13 and the other one was 14.

[01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:54.720]
That's pretty much, you know, I mean, some dogs lived till 20, but these did not.

[01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:57.660]
They're dead.

[01:42:57.660 --> 01:42:58.480]
They're still dead.

[01:42:58.540 --> 01:42:59.980]
Mom is still dead too, by the way.

[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:01.040]
Pop, he's still dead.

[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:01.940]
Son of a bitch.

[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:04.060]
Grandma, Bobby, she's dead.

[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:08.660]
Once you're dead, I know it's a surprise, but you stay dead. Even dogs.

[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:12.440]
Even noble creatures like dogs.

[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:14.700]
And that's why I played the Lord made it all.

[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.620]
It's part of God's plan.

[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:19.960]
And then of course they go to doggie heaven.

[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:23.860]
Where every day they get a nice big fresh bone.

[01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:25.540]
No bones about it.

[01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:26.800]
I know you're going to say that.

[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:31.340]
Archie says, just wanted to inform you of my last McDonald's visit.

[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:32.880]
I went in there and ordered a double hamburger.

[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.220]
They charged me 79 cents for the hamburger.

[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:37.620]
And then charged me 60 cents for an extra patty.

[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:42.980]
Asked the cashier what was up. She said they have to do it because there's no double hamburger on the menu.

[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:46.540]
I ordered a double double cheeseburger with no cheese and got it for 99 cents.

[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:47.040]
No problem.

[01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:48.140]
Oh my God.

[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:50.320]
So 79 and 60 is a dollar 39.

[01:43:50.540 --> 01:43:51.620]
He saved 40 cents.

[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:52.320]
Hey.

[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:57.780]
He says, yeah, it's stupid, but it's the way they nickel and diamond on technicality.

[01:43:57.900 --> 01:44:00.020]
You're going to want to talk about nickel and diamond, okay?

[01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:04.220]
For 40 cents you had to make it semis like this in order to redouble cheeseburger with no cheese.

[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:05.020]
Hold the cheese.

[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:06.320]
Hey, in today's economy.

[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:08.060]
Oh, get out of here.

[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:10.100]
My God.

[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:14.700]
Even the frogs would be embarrassed by your grotesque cheekness.

[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:16.880]
And talking about them nickel and diamond or death.

[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:20.860]
Or did a double cheeseburger no cheese?

[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:24.420]
I mean, why they would even take that order is stupid.

[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:26.160]
Right?

[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:27.140]
Right?

[01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:32.380]
PSN if you had the mini burgers from Burger King, they're great.

[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:35.720]
Just tell them no microwave or they taste like frozen white castle from the microwave.

[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:41.360]
Why would you want to get the mini burgers there when you can go to Wayne Arnold's and get the real of the MS, the Neely burger?

[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:41.760]
That's right.

[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:42.420]
They can in cheese.

[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:43.220]
Oh God.

[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:44.940]
And then not nuked either.

[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:46.700]
They cook them right on the grill in funnier.

[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.460]
It sounds like I'm giving a plug to Wayne and I am.

[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:54.060]
I wonder if he's ever going to bring you any food if you pay for it.

[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:58.820]
Well, yeah, I tried to do that, but I didn't give him enough notice last week when such would be.

[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:05.240]
So next time because everybody's raven about the Wayne Arnold's being reopened again and then rightfully so.

[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:06.600]
They cook him right on the grill.

[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:08.920]
There's greasy little burgers man with the onions.

[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:10.560]
Those great greasy little onions.

[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:11.920]
Oh God, it's a die for.

[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:16.300]
And I still say that some of the best crap I ever had was that cactus.

[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:17.400]
What is it?

[01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:17.840]
What is it called?

[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:19.080]
Cactus lounge in Vancouver.

[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:20.700]
Oh God was that good.

[01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:23.380]
Right around the corner from the hotel.

[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:25.640]
Cat.

[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:29.320]
Little three little cheeseburgers tiny.

[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:34.260]
A little tiny buns with red onions and red relish.

[01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:36.640]
Oh, just to die for.

[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:40.300]
And you're worried about that not not the same kind of sweetness like green relish.

[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:41.220]
I know what you're talking about.

[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:45.660]
But just he delicious just loaded with taste.

[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:50.280]
Barry Jerry says the best airline in the world is Swiss.

[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:52.440]
I thought they were out of business Swiss air.

[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:56.080]
They fly from Miami to Zurich with connections all over Europe.

[01:45:56.380 --> 01:45:59.740]
Their heads and shoulders above any other airline Swiss shwites.

[01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:02.360]
And what would you rather fly?

[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:04.340]
Shwites or shfarts?

[01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:05.240]
Finsker.

[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:08.040]
Swiss.

[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:10.320]
I'm going to have to Google it during the break of Swiss air.

[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:11.160]
I thought went out of business.

[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:12.920]
Maybe there's a new airline is called Swiss.

[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:16.140]
And maybe their planes are like Swiss.

[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:18.180]
They got like, you know, holes, holes on them.

[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:20.780]
How's Easter into them?

[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:22.240]
And national airline.

[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:24.120]
Remember national I was flying to Vegas and all that stuff?

[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:24.840]
No.

[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:25.840]
You know?

[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:29.000]
Of course I'll be stopped from Fort Lauderdale and national airlines.

[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.460]
They last did about five minutes.

[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.500]
Did he chuck it or did he cock it?

[01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:34.340]
I don't know.

[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:43.580]
I don't know.

[01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:44.820]
I don't know.

[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:46.160]

[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:46.840]

[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:47.980]
I don't know.

[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:51.620]
I don't know.

[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:57.060]
I don't know.

[01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:58.200]
I don't know.

[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.380]
I don't know.

[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:01.000]
I don't know.

[01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:03.480]
I don't know.

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.480]

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:03.860]
I don't know.

[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:06.700]
I don't know.

[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:08.880]
I don't know.

[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:08.900]
I don't know.

[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:10.480]
I don't know.

[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:11.720]
I don't know.

[01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:13.140]
I don't know.

[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:15.320]
I don't know.

[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:15.440]
I don't know.

[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:15.440]

[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:16.300]
I don't know.

[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:17.260]

[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:17.260]

[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:17.260]

[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:17.260]

[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:17.260]

[01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:18.820]
I don't know.

[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:19.120]
I don't know.

[01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:20.280]
I don't know.

[01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:21.200]
I don't know.

[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:21.240]
I don't know.

[01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:21.300]

[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:21.720]
I don't know.

[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:22.200]
I don't know.

[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:23.040]
I don't know.

[01:47:24.380 --> 01:47:24.980]
I don't know.

[01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:29.540]
I don't know.

[01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:33.460]
I don't know.

[01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:33.840]
Come on.

[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:35.300]
You're going to go out like some old funny daddy.

[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.940]
You're going to go out with a blazer glory like Beethoven's ninth.

[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:42.300]
What a stupid idiotic email that was.

[01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:43.140]
John Z. T. R.

[01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:44.020]
You can do better than that.

[01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:45.480]
They're getting too obvious now.

[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:47.380]
Too over the top.

[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:51.120]
Very simple solution.

[01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:54.260]
If you don't like the way the show is going these days, find something else to do.

[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:55.340]
Simple as that.

[01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:58.200]
Am I right?

[01:47:58.480 --> 01:47:58.780]
Oh, yeah.

[01:47:59.220 --> 01:47:59.940]
And we show up here.

[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:02.760]
I even showed up here on Friday on the last day of my vacation.

[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:06.320]
To do the picked a pony thing.

[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:10.180]
And that was still running by the Jean-Probocca or Dorham Dorham.

[01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:11.140]
And that's right.

[01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:12.820]
Your friend John Z. T. R.

[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:15.280]
That might become so chummy with fat shut in.

[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:17.760]
Fat shut in.

[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:20.120]
Fat shut in.

[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:20.240]
Fat shut in.

[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:20.820]
I have no life.

[01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:21.920]
Let's see.

[01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:23.660]
Best airline by far is sing air.

[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:24.740]
Is McQuack and Bush.

[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:26.980]
Anytime I go to Asia, it's well worth the premium.

[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:31.940]
Oh, Mike in the four meyers says Mike, who's a handle is McQuack and Bush.

[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:35.940]
Sing ears that like Singapore Airlines or is that different?

[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:36.560]
I don't know.

[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:37.940]
Because I've never gone to Asia.

[01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:40.460]
That was a 59 points.

[01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:41.140]
Let's hear it.

[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:41.660]
All right.

[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:43.040]
There's the Obama bounce.

[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:44.500]
Haven't heard from Maria B.

[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:45.780]
Or today or in a long time.

[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:48.500]
She must be looking at her wound.

[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:49.080]
It wounds.

[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:52.580]
You think?

[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:53.820]
It might be.

[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:58.000]
California lawmaker introduced this pot legalization bill.

[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:01.460]
This is the same California that's broke.

[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:03.440]
They're out of cash.

[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:05.620]
Just like serious.

[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:06.460]
We're fresh out.

[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:07.980]
Remember that?

[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:08.760]
Right.

[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:13.640]
We had that flurry of crap from the fake Greg Budeau and the fake all these serious people.

[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:14.860]
Oh my God.

[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:20.700]
And the funny part of it is I think some of them might have been serious.

[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:21.360]
Yeah.

[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.160]
If California Assemblyman Tom Amiano or that's like Amunin.

[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:33.000]
That's commensurate and talking to Vito Corleone and Godfather 3 or 2 with the big carpet.

[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:34.080]
Amunin.

[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:39.520]
I'm so glad that somebody strayed that out for me because all these times I thought you said come on in.

[01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:40.080]
Come on in.

[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:42.740]
You know, but you wouldn't say come on in.

[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:43.160]
Would you?

[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:44.000]
Why wouldn't you?

[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:45.820]
Amunin.

[01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:47.640]
I still don't know what that means.

[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:50.400]
But you know, I'm gullible.

[01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:54.200]
I mean, maybe the guy just might have said it meant come on in with an accent.

[01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:56.740]
No, but he said come here.

[01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:57.660]
I don't know.

[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:04.600]
If California Assemblyman Tom Amiano has his way, the golden state might become known as the green state to pot smokers around the country.

[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:12.480]
During a press conference yesterday morning in San Francisco, Amiano introduced the marijuana control regulation education act.

[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:15.820]
The far reaching bill would go well beyond the criminalization marriage.

[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:19.900]
We need to actually legalize the cultivation sale purchase and possession of the plant.

[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:23.060]
Did I ever tell you about growing it in my backyard when I lived in Kendall and Tomgate?

[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:23.700]
No.

[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:24.320]
On purpose?

[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:25.540]
Yeah.

[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:26.260]
No.

[01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:30.160]
Well, I mean, I had a roommate at that time.

[01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:30.500]
I see.

[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.540]
Who is gay.

[01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:35.680]
You know, I mean, smoking at crap.

[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:36.900]
I wasn't smoking it.

[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:40.840]
Not that it would make any difference because if I was, I would tell you, but I was not.

[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:41.260]
Right.

[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:41.900]
Not dope.

[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:42.660]
But he was.

[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:46.200]
Drited out in the open, you know, in that whole deal.

[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:49.040]
And then one day there were a bunch of planes flying over.

[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.180]
Well, helicopters, choppers or whatever.

[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:52.580]
And then we pulled them all up.

[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.500]
That was a day.

[01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:54.700]
Huh?

[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:56.300]
I said, the devil you say.

[01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:57.260]
Yeah.

[01:50:58.140 --> 01:50:59.900]
Well, you just can never be too careful.

[01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:01.200]
And this is true, you know.

[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:01.900]
It's true.

[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.960]
You know, growing nasty illegal plants in your backyard.

[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:11.240]
With the state of the midst of an historic economic crisis, the move toward regulating and taxing marijuana is simply common sense.

[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:13.240]
Amiano said he said, I'm on in.

[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:26.920]
This legislation would generate much needed revenue for the state restrict access to only those over 21 and the environmental damage to our public lands from illicit crops and improve public safety by redirecting law enforcement efforts to more serious crimes.

[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:28.080]
Oh, geez.

[01:51:28.260 --> 01:51:29.280]
What a concept that is.

[01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:38.040]
Amiano in a group of speakers during the press conference describe the bills a simple matter of fiscal common sense according to the San Francisco weekly.

[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:50.880]
The bill would remove all penalties under California law for the cultivation, transportation, sale, purchase, possession and use of marijuana, natural THC and paraphernalia by persons over the age of 21.

[01:51:51.380 --> 01:52:01.800]
Would prohibit local and sale on forceman officials from enforcing federal marijuana laws and would create a $50 state fee for each ounce of marijuana sold beyond whatever pot will cost once it becomes legal in those paper said.

[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:04.860]
$50 state fee for each ounce.

[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:07.520]
That sounds a little bit excessive to me.

[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:09.440]
Doesn't it?

[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:09.740]
Yeah.

[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:17.120]
Marijuana rest actually increased 18% in California in 2007, while all other arrests for controlled substances fell.

[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:25.260]
Steve Gutwillig, California's director of drug policy alliance said during the press conference this cost to stay the billion dollars a year and taxpayers are footing the bill.

[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.300]
Meanwhile, black marketers are laughing all the way to the bank.

[01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:32.940]
Just like us, we're laughing all the way to the bank while you're crying. I'm laughing.

[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:35.340]
So how's that car coming?

[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:42.200]
Yeah. Now, what did you tell me about somebody left one of our salespeople?

[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:43.900]
Gary Sardin.

[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:48.400]
No, not Gary Sardin. He left and came back because he's got the naked pictures. He'll never leave permanently.

[01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:55.820]
No matter how many times they, you know, he'll leave and then in a half and then come back and be better off than he was before because he's got naked pictures.

[01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:56.780]
Bob Eisenberg.

[01:52:56.780 --> 01:53:00.600]
Bob Eisenberg is gone. Another Jewel bites the dust.

[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:04.880]
Well, he took a other position for more money is what I was told.

[01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:06.720]
What do you mean by that?

[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:08.900]
He was offered a better job and he took it.

[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:10.580]
In the company?

[01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:11.280]
No.

[01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:13.500]
Oh, well good for him.

[01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:16.660]
Fing as clown.

[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:21.120]
Hey, don't you remember what he said about me that first week we were down here on the second floor?

[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:25.100]
I know, but you know, I was sitting right in there and I heard it with my own three years, man.

[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:27.220]
Oh, that Neil Rogers, he's an F and S clown.

[01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:29.140]
Well, you shouldn't have ripped his hair piece.

[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:32.280]
You know, nobody ever takes it kindly when you do that, you know.

[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:35.420]
When I ripped their hair piece so far, they ripped it right off and throw it away.

[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:36.320]
Well, that's like Steve's there.

[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:39.460]
And Mo, even more of the Mo man.

[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:40.100]
The Mo man.

[01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:42.860]
Remove those ridiculous pieces, right?

[01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:45.500]
Remember that movie, Five Easy Pieces?

[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:46.040]
Sure.

[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:48.520]
They were about Mo's collection.

[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:53.800]
And didn't you tell me that he had like one Sunday go to meetin' and the different one for each day of the format?

[01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:54.080]
I don't know that right.

[01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:55.660]
It's a special occasion.

[01:53:55.980 --> 01:53:56.120]
Mm-hmm.

[01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:00.820]
He had one there that was called the Oftzulachis piece.

[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:04.900]
I wonder who the doctor was who performed the surgery on that one.

[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:09.720]
That has to be, many people's very favorite.

[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:10.280]
Mm-hmm.

[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:10.860]
That clip.

[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:11.920]
That's a golden moment.

[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:13.760]
The doctor who performed the surgery.

[01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:17.360]
And then Gildi, you know, smircling.

[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:18.920]
Gildi smircling, man.

[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:20.120]
Nothing like it.

[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:23.420]
Twenty-two one at five sixty WQM.

[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:25.420]
Where you dutch packin'?

[01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:26.960]
Five sixty, three sixty.

[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:27.720]
Where to go?

[01:54:28.060 --> 01:54:28.520]
What to do?

[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:29.340]
How to get there?

[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:30.080]
Five.

[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:33.140]
Joindem Le QAM, and Joyce's Jocelyn House.

[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:37.580]
From four to five A.M. for private jocelyn in the VIP room.

[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:40.180]
WQAM will be there with Latsum.

[01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:41.800]
Who will cry?

[01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:47.160]
They can stay Joindem Le QAM at the day county metadone clinic.

[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:49.920]
Between six and eight A.M. for Latsum.

[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:51.440]
Who will cry?

[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.840]
The crisis that may say your life has seen.

[01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:57.540]
Like the five sixty floating keyfab.

[01:54:58.240 --> 01:54:59.520]
A pororo po calabria.

[01:55:00.540 --> 01:55:01.640]
Excuse me, one moment.

[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:05.640]
Chicken, rooster, chicken, rooster.

[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:10.660]
Roar, roar, rooster, chicken, rooster, chicken, rooster, chicken, rooster, chicken, rooster.

[01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:11.320]
Okay.

[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:12.780]
Gildi.

[01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:17.620]
Joindem Le QAM for the crack-coast street walker walker time.

[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:20.720]
WQAM will be there with Latsum.

[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.480]
Who will cry?

[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:29.640]
They can stay Joindem Le QAM in Fort Myers this weekend for the American Family Association Convention.

[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:35.460]
Where you will find the latest enhancement products that will make you thicker and brighter.

[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:37.960]
WQAM will be there with Latsum.

[01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:39.520]
Who will cry?

[01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:43.260]
So whatever happened to a beener boy, by the way?

[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:45.320]
Your friend, you found him.

[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:47.440]
We got the conversation.

[01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:48.900]
What do we find to say?

[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:51.680]
The last time we had this conversation, it would be exactly the same.

[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:52.740]
And what's that?

[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:56.620]
I haven't heard of him since, and I don't want to.

[01:55:57.240 --> 01:55:58.100]
Not my friend.

[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:00.540]
Yes, I found him or he found me.

[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:01.160]
Never the less.

[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:02.860]
What do you mean he's not your friend?

[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:03.880]
Not my friend.

[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:05.340]
He found us.

[01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:07.300]
I got him the job here.

[01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:09.020]
What happened happened?

[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:10.880]
Haven't heard of him since.

[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.000]
That is Swiss Air, by the way.

[01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:16.440]
Somebody just sent me a picture of a beautiful A340 landing in MIA.

[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:21.720]
Swiss Air with the white in the red with the red little white cross on the tail.

[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.940]
Swiss Air, Schweitz, they're still in Venice.

[01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:28.860]
Oh, the fake Greg Budell is like really.

[01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:32.680]
He says, I saw your pick on Facebook.

[01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:34.400]
Well, that's interesting because I'm not on Facebook.

[01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:35.800]
You're getting old.

[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:39.240]
When you pass on, me thinks the Greg Budell show would fit in nicely to QM.

[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:40.020]
What say you?

[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:43.400]
You still suck, Greg, and everybody hates you like poison, like they always did.

[01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:44.420]
Love Greg.

[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:48.100]
And then the second one says, by the way, when I move in to take your seat,

[01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:49.440]
George is by by.

[01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:51.420]
I won't need a second banana as you do.

[01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:55.620]
Oh no, one thing we know about you, Greg, you would never need a second banana.

[01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:58.260]
It's a good time before the great take.

[01:56:58.380 --> 01:56:58.900]
Tony Baloney.

[01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:00.600]
Neil, this is Noodles.

[01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:04.380]
Reminding you that it's always a good time for the...

[01:57:04.380 --> 01:57:05.420]
Great taste.

[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:08.940]
Oh, brother, say what you will about George, but he's heads and shoulders above noodles,

[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.220]
above Don Agony.

[01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:16.240]
God, talk about an appropriately named ass clown, Don Agony.

[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:22.420]
Could be the real Greg Budell for all we know, because he's been just waiting for me to

[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:23.000]
croak, you know.

[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:27.280]
In fact, back when those ugly contract negotiations were going on, don't you remember he was in

[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:28.280]
the building in the Joe Bell?

[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:30.120]
Actually, was escorting him around?

[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:31.560]
I don't remember.

[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:33.240]
Showing him off like his newest trophy?

[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:35.220]
I don't remember.

[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:39.560]
Greg Budell, who's pining away, by the way, somewhere in Alabama with a vanje one is

[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:39.720]
thing?

[01:57:40.900 --> 01:57:41.880]
Talk about failure.

[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:44.760]
Talk about a decrepit broken down failure.

[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:46.100]
God, Greg.

[01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:49.400]
Now wonder if everybody hates you like poison, and wishes you would die of wicked death.

[01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:51.180]
How about you even Rick Shaw hates Greg Budell?

[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:53.420]
How about you Rick Riley hates him?

[01:57:55.260 --> 01:57:58.060]
Next time my son comes in, ask him about the Greg Budell.

[01:57:58.340 --> 01:57:58.520]
Okay.

[01:57:59.180 --> 01:58:00.020]
I'll write it down.

[01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:01.820]
Mark it down.

[01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:06.520]
Rodolfo says you are absolutely correct sir about curry.

[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:08.340]
Absolutely correct sir.

[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:13.620]
This spice goes back to 1700 BC in a massive attaining area, era.

[01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:19.040]
It was used to preserve meat and it's made, it made its way to India a few hundred years later.

[01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:25.040]
Of course, the crooked teeth and stinky brits adopted that disgusting culinary culture,

[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:29.140]
and now they call this about anything that's Indian curry.

[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:33.800]
Because of the heavy Middle Eastern Arab culture in Canada, you see that a lot.

[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:34.620]
Oh yeah, you sure do.

[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:36.240]
You see it and you smell it.

[01:58:37.340 --> 01:58:37.740]
Whoa.

[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:42.920]
It is disgusting and unfortunately those need alike Indians toss curry on everything.

[01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:48.640]
Their diet consists of grains and vegetables and to enhance the bland flavor,

[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:50.800]
they bathed in that God awful spice.

[01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:51.740]
Curry.

[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:54.540]
Oh, kaka.

[01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:58.840]
I agree with the comment on the service of Scarecandid.

[01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:01.140]
Pretty much is the same for most airlines these days.

[01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:05.960]
British Airways has the club seat, a step above first class, which is superb.

[01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:08.000]
I can only imagine how much that caused.

[01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:11.940]
Aside from them, I think that Singapore Airlines has the best service and cover to the world,

[01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:14.020]
even better than some of personal aircraft.

[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.580]
Then again, a round-trip ticket in New York City, the London and the World Club,

[01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:19.500]
doesn't cost less than 9,500 bucks.

[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:21.840]
Singapore Airlines is a times even more expensive.

[01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:28.380]
I hope you enjoyed your vacation into those winers who only complain and critique F them.

[01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:29.280]
The show is free.

[01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:30.460]
The show is good if you don't like it.

[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:32.060]
Turn the dial, ask why.

[01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:33.420]
Very well said, Red Alpha.

[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:36.300]
Like I said before, if you don't like it, go away.

[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:37.040]
That's all.

[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:39.220]
We come into our best air-week day.

[01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:41.080]
We show up. We say we don't care, but that's a joke.

[01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:41.840]
Well, partially.

[01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:45.640]
Our motto is that if the people are run adjoined, don't give a crap.

[01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:47.580]
Why should we get like all bent out of shape about it?

[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:48.360]
Life is too short.

[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:51.180]
And some of us are getting really, really old.

[01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:54.000]
So Monday is our big anniversary show.

[01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:54.620]
Do you realize that?

[01:59:54.660 --> 01:59:56.060]
Are they making a big, a big, a semi-subout?

[01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:57.340]
Oh, yeah. You should think.

[01:59:57.540 --> 01:59:58.280]
Any discussion with that time?

[01:59:58.320 --> 01:59:59.620]
It doesn't spot where you're going to have a guy come.

[01:59:59.840 --> 01:59:59.920]
We're going to have a guy come.

[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.340]
The bounce house clown, time balloon animals.

[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:07.760]
Yeah, I can just see Josh Friedman coming back to do the bounce house with the beast.

[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:08.920]
Wow.

[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:14.380]
Can only imagine.

[02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:17.040]
Do you realize it's almost a one o'clock already?

[02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:19.100]
I better start getting with it.

[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:21.240]
I better get on my pantaloonies and my shirt.

[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:22.220]
Yeah.

[02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:22.580]
I choose.

[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:23.800]
Choose.

[02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:27.660]
You're ready for a big trip today, maybe breaking those new machines, man.

[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:32.440]
Maybe that guy's right.

[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:37.340]
When they put on the new machines, wait until they get all filled up.

[02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:38.700]
You know, I don't believe that.

[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:43.440]
All the way. They just have a point because if they're programmed,

[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:45.200]
which they are to pay out a certain percentage,

[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:49.180]
I mean, the percentage of nothing is still nothing.

[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:53.780]
It's like your paycheck, you know, like that 3% raise you were going to get.

[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:55.380]
And then you got the 5% cut.

[02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:57.100]
So you're like minus two.

[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:00.140]
What a slap and a push that is.

[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:01.920]
I don't know how you let them get away with that.

[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:04.300]
Oh, yeah. Well, you know, no, seriously.

[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:07.820]
I mean, if somebody offers you a 3% pay raise and a contract,

[02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:09.000]
you should just quit.

[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:13.840]
No, you should have just taken your pants down and taken a big dump on the desk with everybody there.

[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:15.760]
You said it was a mob scene there.

[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:16.320]
Yeah.

[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.580]
That would have left a really good impression, man.

[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:24.300]
Just like that scurvy curry would have left a real taste in people's mouths.

[02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:28.180]
And what we got back from, um,

[02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:30.160]
Woodbine last night,

[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.440]
Me and Paco got in the elevator.

[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:35.460]
And just as the doors were about to close,

[02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:38.460]
a dark, complex, and pleasant building came on the elevator with us.

[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:42.600]
And just by luck, good luck, bad luck,

[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:44.340]
I farted really loud.

[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:49.280]
Loud, loudly, loudly.

[02:01:50.700 --> 02:01:52.400]
I cut the cheese bad.

[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:54.360]
And I don't, I don't think it smelled.

[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:56.080]
I didn't have time to hang around.

[02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:57.440]
We're almost in my floor anyway.

[02:02:01.420 --> 02:02:03.660]
And I thought to myself, that'll teach him.

[02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:08.780]
The muscle is way under the elevator when the doors are just about closed.

[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:09.440]
That'll teach him.

[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:16.680]
Yeah.

[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:19.500]
Do you think I, do you think I was able to do it intentionally or was this an accident?

[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:20.980]
I think it was lucky.

[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:22.080]
Yeah.

[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:24.240]
I think I was lucky or there that I was a woodbine.

[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:27.540]
Although I did pretty good except for Paco, Paco, Paco, Paco,

[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:28.520]
loose in whatever I won.

[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:30.300]
He's good at that.

[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:34.640]
What are you most admire about Abe Lincoln is our horse ball pole today.

[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:36.700]
And we are just embarrassed and mortified.

[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:40.040]
That pole is off Tzulachas.

[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:44.060]
He freed the slaves Lincoln did 72.

[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:45.820]
WTF is going to be number one.

[02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:47.060]
It's got 66 already.

[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:49.740]
It's going to pass the slaves like they're laying out.

[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:52.160]
He saved the Union 56.

[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:54.240]
He led the nation to the Civil War 50.

[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:57.100]
Wasn't that the same as he saved the Union?

[02:02:57.920 --> 02:02:58.280]
I imagine.

[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:00.980]
Well, Charlie B has to make a whole lot of choices on here.

[02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:05.240]
But which makes it look to, you know, to the unsuspecting like it's a really good pole.

[02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:06.680]
Piece of crap, Charlie.

[02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:07.300]
It sucks.

[02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:09.620]
He was a great president 43.

[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:13.100]
He succeeded despite limited schooling 22.

[02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:16.000]
He wore a spiffy stove top hat 19.

[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:17.560]
He might have been gay 18.

[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:19.860]
His getty's burgred dress 18.

[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:23.220]
He liked to tell stories and cracked dirty jokes 13.

[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:25.400]
He was honest Abe 13.

[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:26.660]
He was pro labor 10.

[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:28.660]
He gave his name to a fine car.

[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:31.000]
Eight.

[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:33.040]
He was a master in debater.

[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:33.640]
Eight.

[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:36.020]
He looks good on a shiny new penny five.

[02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:37.200]
I don't think he looked good on anything.

[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:39.480]
He came from a log cabin five.

[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:41.560]
He was his memorial in DC five.

[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:44.100]
His improved his looks with a beard three.

[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:48.240]
He graces the $5 bill to his height one and his name one.

[02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:50.120]
Abraham Lincoln.

[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:50.360]
What?

[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:52.560]
Why don't understand what the idea is with his name.

[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:54.220]
Honest Abe.

[02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:57.040]
What about it?

[02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:58.080]
What about Murray Lincoln?

[02:03:59.300 --> 02:03:59.780]
Crazy Mary.

[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:01.780]
Remember crazy Mary Lincoln?

[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:03.240]
Yeah.

[02:04:03.460 --> 02:04:04.940]
So that's the pole such as it is.

[02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:05.640]
How many votes have we got?

[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:07.420]
400 and some odd.

[02:04:07.460 --> 02:04:07.940]
That's not bad.

[02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:08.780]
440.

[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:12.840]
If we make it to 500, I think that the fake email or before was full of crap.

[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:15.740]
Oh, you're going to be sold about first of all.

[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:16.620]
He's got all his numbers wrong.

[02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:18.500]
I'm not anywhere near 70 years old.

[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:20.160]
66 in a couple of months.

[02:04:20.260 --> 02:04:20.600]
Okay.

[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:22.560]
Not even 67 yet.

[02:04:23.580 --> 02:04:25.560]
One thing I've learned is that when you start getting this old,

[02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:27.280]
you don't start pushing the next decade.

[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:28.600]
Oh, he's almost 70.

[02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:29.660]
Then it'll be like almost 80.

[02:04:29.940 --> 02:04:31.180]
Or maybe then it'll be in a box.

[02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:34.960]
I don't think that thing about being in a box is all that bad.

[02:04:35.540 --> 02:04:40.240]
Not that I'm eagerly awaiting it, but I don't think it can be all that bad.

[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:41.720]
Not if it's a nice box.

[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:43.980]
And ice box?

[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:44.980]
Sure, that's it.

[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:46.100]
Yeah, put them on ice.

[02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:47.900]
Freeze the old son of a bitch.

[02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:50.040]
Ice box.

[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:52.540]
Remember they used to call it, wait before your time.

[02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:55.240]
They also used to call refrigerator, fridge air,

[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:57.120]
which was also a brand name.

[02:04:59.060 --> 02:05:01.480]
But they used to call it fridge air and the fridge.

[02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:03.960]
But also ice box.

[02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:07.880]
I remember when the ice man in the milkman used to come to our house in Rochester.

[02:05:09.180 --> 02:05:11.580]
The ice man had a big like like calipers,

[02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:14.280]
like the things that the big old uses to measure those jocks penis.

[02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:17.760]
A big calipers to carry the ice.

[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:21.720]
What?

[02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:23.540]
I thought he used a ruler.

[02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:27.880]
Calipers, really?

[02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:28.860]
Oh, yeah.

[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:30.200]
Ask the big old with the edges in.

[02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:33.440]
Ask him how he how the players measured up.

[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:35.040]
Ask him how Brady Quinn measured up.

[02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:39.420]
How much he's hung like a butterfly, like a mosquito.

[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:43.460]
Maybe that's what he's reaching around for in all those pictures.

[02:05:43.780 --> 02:05:46.560]
By the way, speaking of pictures, this next week or two,

[02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:49.080]
especially in honor of our anniversary, 33 years in town,

[02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:52.740]
we got to like do, rediddle our, rejigger our website.

[02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:54.980]
It's getting really old and stale.

[02:05:55.260 --> 02:05:56.160]
Kind of like the show, you know?

[02:05:57.120 --> 02:05:58.120]
Old and stale.

[02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:00.500]
Oh, I'm waiting for that great wit and for you.

[02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:01.240]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:02.100]
Sure you are.

[02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:06.160]
Take a shmit and you'll find some wit stick your head in the bowl

[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:08.520]
within and then press that little lever, man.

[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:12.820]
Scott and panelists, parks is when I was in college up in civilization.

[02:06:13.420 --> 02:06:17.000]
Massachusetts in the early 80s, the term referred to joints bones.

[02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:18.080]
Anybody got any bones?

[02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:20.200]
Was the way of asking if anybody had any weed?

[02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:23.040]
No, you use, do you use such lingo?

[02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:24.000]
No.

[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:25.420]
Have you heard such lingo?

[02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:26.440]
Anybody got any bones?

[02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:26.840]
Nope.

[02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:28.780]
No, well, maybe you better start asking.

[02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:31.420]
Maybe you'll get better and bigger joints.

[02:06:32.420 --> 02:06:33.940]
Roll them up in the day and a herald.

[02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:34.460]
That's right.

[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:35.400]
That's not saying much anymore.

[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:37.140]
They used to be quite an accomplishment.

[02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:40.740]
But now, you know, all the newspapers are about four pages.

[02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:45.080]
And that's because everybody's going out of business.

[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:45.980]
Everybody's going broke.

[02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:48.860]
Radio stations, TV stations, radio newspapers.

[02:06:50.780 --> 02:06:51.700]
Everybody's going bust.

[02:06:53.060 --> 02:06:54.900]
Got a big ass depression.

[02:06:55.940 --> 02:06:59.160]
Oh, here we go.

[02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:00.080]
You are on Facebook.

[02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:01.600]
There's a Neil Group on FB.

[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:02.260]
I don't care.

[02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:03.620]
And there's a link to it.

[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:04.960]
Maybe I'll check it out.

[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:05.280]
You think?

[02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:06.000]
Whatever.

[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:06.820]
Oh, here you go.

[02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:09.340]
Maria B answers the call.

[02:07:09.620 --> 02:07:10.120]
Maria B.

[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:11.540]
Boy, she got some freaking nerve.

[02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:18.980]
I'm still waiting for the confirmation for the Invest for your future Friday segment.

[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:21.600]
Yeah, we're replacing the horse racing thing.

[02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:26.060]
The picked the pony with the Friday segment with Baggy Maria B.

[02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:27.220]
Can you imagine that?

[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:30.700]
And the Invest for your future Friday?

[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:33.800]
Well, at least that's something to look forward to in the one o'clock hours.

[02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:37.120]
Maria B's latest misive.

[02:07:37.300 --> 02:07:38.980]
Oh, Tiger Woods is ready to play.

[02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:41.640]
Now, now we can go on.

[02:07:43.020 --> 02:07:44.440]
Now life can continue.

[02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:45.100]
Here we go.

[02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:46.600]
We've got it.

[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:47.540]
It's Scott Barrell.

[02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:51.060]
And when I'm up in Boca Tiga, slapping old women with painted lips around the pool.

[02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:53.000]
I listen to the Neil Rogers one to two hours.

[02:07:53.500 --> 02:07:57.000]
I mean, I listen to the Neil Rogers hair and balance one to two hours.

[02:07:57.140 --> 02:07:58.580]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

[02:08:00.020 --> 02:08:05.120]
Little if he won, too bad you got crushed.

[02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:11.820]
The brass of genital waters didn't have the guts.

[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:17.280]
Just say, oh, the big boy oh, when the checks were cut.

[02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:18.620]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:22.200]
All you had to do was plug it and charge it up.

[02:08:22.220 --> 02:08:23.260]
D.D.1.

[02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:28.280]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:31.360]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:34.400]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:08:34.980 --> 02:08:37.440]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:41.500]
The animals crushed the E.D.1.

[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:56.180]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:00.660]

[02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:00.680]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:00.680]

[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:00.680]

[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:01.040]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:04.200]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:05.500]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:11.220]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:35.580]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.620]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:39.400]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:39.800]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:39.900]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:41.020]
Rain, back a little GD1.

[02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:41.200]
A really big couch talking Spencer.

[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:41.200]

[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:41.200]

[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:41.200]

[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:45.000]
But great back a little TV want the

[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.060]
And oh

[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:47.740]
Crush the

[02:09:47.740 --> 02:09:48.580]
E.V.W.

[02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:52.020]
All right 103.

[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:54.960]
I had a really great the cost

[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:56.480]
to keep me on there and I lost it.

[02:09:56.560 --> 02:09:57.140]
Oh no.

[02:09:57.840 --> 02:09:59.220]
Where the hell am I going to find it?

[02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:00.940]
Oh here it is in the trash.

[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:02.560]
Here it is from Mr.

[02:10:02.700 --> 02:10:03.120]
Phone number.

[02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:04.940]
You know people that have no name

[02:10:04.940 --> 02:10:06.060]
not even a fake one but they have

[02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:06.520]
a phone number.

[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:06.820]
Right.

[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:09.880]
2008 overnight visitors to Miami

[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:12.140]
12 million plus 2008 overnight

[02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:13.840]
visitors to Vancouver less than

[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:14.920]
half six million.

[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:16.900]
It Rogers goes twice to Vancouver

[02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:18.140]
but not once to Miami.

[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:21.000]
Yeah and and the point being.

[02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:25.140]
See I don't know about you but this

[02:10:25.140 --> 02:10:26.000]
is the way I look at it.

[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:27.740]
It's my money and it's my time and

[02:10:27.740 --> 02:10:29.400]
I'll spend the money to go wherever

[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:31.160]
the hell I want and do whatever I

[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:32.800]
want without answering the

[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:33.160]
phone number.

[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:34.440]
Oh check out the phone number.

[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:34.900]
What?

[02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:36.900]
You got to put it up on the poll

[02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:38.180]
every time you want to go to

[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:40.540]
Miami or whatever.

[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:41.920]
Let's stop your options.

[02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:43.100]
Let the audience decide where you

[02:10:43.100 --> 02:10:43.240]
go.

[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:44.280]
Blow it out your ass Mr.

[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:45.080]
Phone number Mr.

[02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:46.120]
anonymous phone number.

[02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:47.600]
Not even smart enough to come up

[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:48.480]
with a fake name.

[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:50.020]
That's really pathetic.

[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:52.580]
Now let me check that Facebook

[02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:53.020]
thing out.

[02:10:53.020 --> 02:10:54.260]
There's a group on Facebook

[02:10:54.260 --> 02:10:55.120]
about this show.

[02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:57.220]
Oh yeah there's my picture.

[02:10:57.360 --> 02:10:58.300]
Yeah I'm old and there's

[02:10:58.300 --> 02:10:58.600]
George.

[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:01.940]
There's us from that horrible

[02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:03.480]
wonderful day at the Gulf

[02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:03.800]
Stream.

[02:11:05.260 --> 02:11:07.000]
The near Roger show it has nothing

[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.040]
to do with me.

[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:08.160]

[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:10.240]
Are you familiar with this?

[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:11.740]
I'm aware that it exists.

[02:11:12.100 --> 02:11:12.780]
But you are?

[02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:13.680]
I don't know.

[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:14.620]
Well put it up there.

[02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:15.780]
I don't know if you clicked

[02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:16.940]
somewhere on there it'll say.

[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:19.520]
We have 55 members.

[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:21.120]
We got Scott and the whole

[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:22.500]
and my group's rubber theory.

[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:24.260]
They're groups for cocoa pebbles.

[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:25.040]
I mean there's a lot of you.

[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:26.380]
Oh my God.

[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:32.260]
Neil thanks for accepting my

[02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:32.660]
request.

[02:11:32.860 --> 02:11:33.980]
I'll log off now with a new

[02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:34.520]
response.

[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:35.840]
What are they talking about?

[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:36.220]
Hmm.

[02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:38.800]
Accepting my request.

[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:44.600]
This thing is to it's like the

[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:45.920]
unauthorized Facebook.

[02:11:47.140 --> 02:11:48.780]
Sign up for Facebook to join the

[02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:49.480]
near Roger show.

[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:50.660]
How do we get rid of this?

[02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:52.500]
I don't know.

[02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:53.640]
Reporting to Facebook or

[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:53.880]
something.

[02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:55.500]
We do what?

[02:11:55.860 --> 02:11:56.440]
I don't know.

[02:11:57.320 --> 02:11:58.060]
Well screw it.

[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.260]
Chew it and screw it.

[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:03.880]
Oh Albert.

[02:12:04.140 --> 02:12:04.980]
Oh good old.

[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:06.680]
Dr. Al.

[02:12:06.780 --> 02:12:07.520]
Remember Dr. Al?

[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:09.840]
Yeah.

[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:11.320]
You blocked him but he's back on

[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:12.080]
the block group.

[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:13.380]
So let me see what he's got to say.

[02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:14.380]
Something about hemorrhoids.

[02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:16.200]
Remember Dr. Al?

[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:17.420]
Yeah.

[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:18.560]
You do?

[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:20.080]
Vagely.

[02:12:20.620 --> 02:12:21.260]
Here's one of you.

[02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:21.900]
Have you ever been to Prime

[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:23.460]
one 12 in South Beach and it's got a

[02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:25.060]
picture of a beautiful looking place?

[02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:25.720]
No I have not.

[02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:28.120]
And no I know I will I ever.

[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:29.220]
I'm sure that.

[02:12:30.420 --> 02:12:31.780]
He goes to Vancouver.

[02:12:31.780 --> 02:12:33.140]
He's got some nerve.

[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:34.000]

[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:38.000]
I'm sure that Miami is the first

[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:39.400]
of your city to Vancouver.

[02:12:40.260 --> 02:12:41.480]
Magnum mistake about that.

[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:44.520]
Like I said they share the same

[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:46.100]
problem beautiful places.

[02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:47.220]
Wrong people.

[02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:50.060]
Dr. Rouse's after my bloody

[02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:51.560]
exploding hemorrhoid last October.

[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:52.720]
I began to have a lot of

[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:53.440]
bloating and discovered.

[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:57.780]
I remember you used to complain

[02:12:57.780 --> 02:12:59.020]
about irritated ball syndrome.

[02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:00.460]
I guess I had that along with the

[02:13:00.460 --> 02:13:01.760]
most stinky parts on a

[02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:02.980]
imaginable.

[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:04.960]
So then I'm on a liquid diet

[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:06.260]
in preparation for a colonoscopy

[02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:06.500]
tomorrow.

[02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:07.080]
Ever had one?

[02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:07.500]
Yes.

[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:08.180]
Should I be scared?

[02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:08.460]
No.

[02:13:09.060 --> 02:13:10.180]
Any info would be greatly

[02:13:10.180 --> 02:13:10.580]
appreciated.

[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:12.160]
You won't even know that they were

[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:14.100]
snooping around up your ass.

[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:16.360]
And of course in your case, Dr. Rouse,

[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:17.520]
probably wouldn't be the first time.

[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:20.660]
But no they give you like some knockout

[02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:20.940]
stuff.

[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:21.900]
They give you a shot.

[02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:24.780]
And then they they had their way

[02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:25.100]
with you.

[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:26.560]
You know they do whatever they in you

[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:27.700]
wake up and you have no idea what

[02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:28.080]
happened.

[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:29.720]
And you're a little groggy and

[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:30.120]
that's it.

[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:32.380]
And then they give you the good news

[02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:33.840]
or the bad news.

[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:37.040]
Like you've got a tumor in there

[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:38.720]
the size of a bowling ball, Dr. Rouse,

[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:39.500]
which we hope not.

[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:41.920]
You know, looking for medical

[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:43.100]
advice, he says, how do you like

[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:43.360]
that?

[02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:45.080]
This guy's got a real

[02:13:45.860 --> 02:13:46.220]
problem.

[02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:47.940]
Maybe he's an ass clown.

[02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:51.100]
George got a big charge out of

[02:13:51.100 --> 02:13:52.280]
that ass clown thing on the

[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:52.480]
Y.

[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:53.660]
I don't know what it means.

[02:13:53.860 --> 02:13:54.460]
It just sounds funny.

[02:13:54.460 --> 02:13:55.360]
Ass clown?

[02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:56.660]
Well, we can't say the other

[02:13:56.660 --> 02:13:57.800]
word the whole word.

[02:13:57.860 --> 02:13:58.560]
Oh, that's right.

[02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:01.460]
So I think now, once Joyce gets

[02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:02.740]
wind of ass clowns and probably

[02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:04.440]
oh, you can't say that because

[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:06.340]
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:07.060]
Yeah.

[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.400]
This waned beast and this queen

[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:13.640]
quit, quit the sent me crap.

[02:14:13.780 --> 02:14:14.080]
Okay.

[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:16.420]
Everything he said, he's some

[02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:18.960]
of professional queen with some

[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:19.580]
organization.

[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:20.920]
I'm just not picking these

[02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:22.200]
emails from organizations.

[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:22.860]
You know what I mean?

[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:23.420]
Uh-huh.

[02:14:23.420 --> 02:14:25.400]
So media consulting, uh-yah,

[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:26.540]
yadi, yadi, all this crap.

[02:14:27.020 --> 02:14:28.140]
Here's Maria Bartero, who

[02:14:28.140 --> 02:14:28.600]
responded.

[02:14:30.220 --> 02:14:31.680]
Doesn't it warm the cockles of

[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:32.020]
your heart?

[02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:32.720]
Warm something.

[02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:34.540]
Well, what does that mean?

[02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:35.940]
Warm the cockles of your heart?

[02:14:36.060 --> 02:14:36.480]
Let me look it up.

[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:38.400]
Warm, look up cockles.

[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:39.580]
Do it at now.

[02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:42.720]
Maria says, hello, Mr.

[02:14:42.900 --> 02:14:42.980]
Rogers.

[02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:44.040]
I'm glad to hear that you're back

[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:44.460]
from vacation.

[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:46.220]
I did listen yesterday, but

[02:14:46.220 --> 02:14:47.380]
with swamp covering the story and

[02:14:47.380 --> 02:14:48.100]
how the government might be

[02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:49.080]
nationalizing the banks.

[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:49.980]
When you were gone on

[02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:51.540]
vacation, I got a makeover and

[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:52.800]
cut my hair short like a bowl

[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:53.140]
cut.

[02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:55.180]
You still look like crap, honey.

[02:14:55.460 --> 02:14:57.380]
And your bags are worst than ever.

[02:14:57.480 --> 02:14:59.020]
I saw her have heard 10 seconds

[02:14:59.020 --> 02:14:59.440]
yesterday.

[02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:01.220]
It's a show again, but you know what?

[02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:02.880]
That song, selling cockles and

[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:04.100]
muscles, the live alive, oh?

[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:05.360]
Yeah, sure.

[02:15:05.420 --> 02:15:06.200]
Selfish like a clam.

[02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:07.180]
I'll be damned.

[02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:08.740]
I'll be claimed.

[02:15:08.860 --> 02:15:09.700]
So what does that mean?

[02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:10.680]
The cockles of your heart?

[02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:12.100]
What are the cockles of your heart?

[02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:13.440]
Funny you should ask, because I'm

[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:14.540]
uh- clicking on that now.

[02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:15.140]
Oh.

[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:17.080]
Furthermore, while you were gone,

[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:18.160]
I don't know if you caught the

[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:19.340]
steering house serious was able to

[02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:20.620]
get a financier to cover their dead.

[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:21.460]
Yeah, I saw that.

[02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:23.900]
A great free market success story.

[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:25.140]
Well, I don't want to be the dead

[02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:26.380]
horse, but we're close to the bottom.

[02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:27.940]
And just like I recommended the

[02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:30.180]
doubt 14,000 and 9,000, I have a

[02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:30.440]
strong.

[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:35.360]
I have a strong buy on the

[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:36.900]
doubt at 7,000.

[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:38.700]
Oh, that's a great line.

[02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:39.820]
Just like I recommended the

[02:15:39.820 --> 02:15:42.160]
doubt 14,000 and 9,000, she's got a

[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:43.480]
strong buy at 7,000.

[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:44.640]
I hope you and your

[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:46.060]
listeners don't forget the best

[02:15:46.060 --> 02:15:47.480]
path to prosperity is a free

[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:48.380]
market society.

[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:50.540]
Regardless of Maria B, PSM is still

[02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:52.060]
waiting on the confirmation for the

[02:15:52.060 --> 02:15:53.540]
investor your future Friday show.

[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:54.060]
Oh, yeah.

[02:15:56.020 --> 02:15:56.940]
Oh, yeah, Maria.

[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:00.340]
Maria's got diarrhea of the mouth.

[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:02.160]
The market's under pressure.

[02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:03.180]
It's under pressure.

[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:05.440]
Remember those days when I was

[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:06.920]
invested in that crap and every

[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:07.980]
time she would do that, I would just

[02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:08.640]
want to kill her.

[02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:09.880]
Just strangle that bitch.

[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:13.640]
Oh, the doubt is up 101 points.

[02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:15.140]
So today, oh, look at that.

[02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:15.700]
Looky, looky.

[02:16:15.740 --> 02:16:16.360]
Here comes cookie.

[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:17.520]
Doesn't that make you want to go

[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:18.700]
just jump right in there?

[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:19.220]
Oh, yeah.

[02:16:22.540 --> 02:16:24.720]
And then Bernanke says, recovery

[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:26.240]
in the US will require a global

[02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:27.180]
recovery.

[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:29.020]
In other words, he said, don't

[02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:29.560]
hold your breath.

[02:16:30.020 --> 02:16:31.180]
Go to woodbind, plunge your guts

[02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:31.380]
out.

[02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:34.060]
Let's see how that loony is doing,

[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:34.260]
eh?

[02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:35.860]
Let's hope it's still under 80 cent.

[02:16:37.580 --> 02:16:38.640]
What can you imagine if it ever

[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:40.140]
went down to like about 30, 40 cent

[02:16:40.140 --> 02:16:41.420]
wouldn't that be great for me anyway?

[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:43.380]
Well, well, yeah, wood.

[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:45.520]
Oil 38, 71 and barrel.

[02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:46.700]
Roll out the barrel, baby.

[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:48.140]
Let's get some of that damn oil.

[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:51.880]
See, I wrote in those, and speaking

[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:53.140]
of Vancouver, those electric cabs,

[02:16:54.020 --> 02:16:55.960]
electric cars, and I didn't see any

[02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:56.700]
problem with them at all.

[02:16:56.760 --> 02:16:57.520]
They were just fine.

[02:16:57.660 --> 02:16:58.300]
They zip right along.

[02:16:59.520 --> 02:16:59.920]
Yeah.

[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:02.340]
So why are we still prisoners

[02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:04.160]
to the freaking schmata head.

[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:04.520]
Shut up.

[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:05.040]
That's why.

[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:05.800]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:10.140]
That's why that's why don't rock

[02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:11.220]
the boat or all of a sudden you

[02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:12.780]
won't have no boat to rock it.

[02:17:14.020 --> 02:17:15.740]
The TSX is down two points.

[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:17.020]
The Dow is up 97.

[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:18.440]
The NASDAQ's up 18.

[02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:20.060]
Let's do a Rick Rally here.

[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:21.660]
I still don't see the loony.

[02:17:22.140 --> 02:17:23.580]
Come on now with the loony.

[02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:25.300]
I'm sure that everybody in

[02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:26.660]
South Florida is really all excited

[02:17:26.660 --> 02:17:28.200]
about, especially all the frogs

[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:28.780]
down there.

[02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:31.120]
I'm surprised they even use the same

[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:31.840]
currency and Quebec.

[02:17:32.140 --> 02:17:32.860]
Oh, it's over 80.

[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:34.040]
It's 80.21 cent.

[02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:34.680]
Not good.

[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:35.920]
It went up to 0.29.

[02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:39.260]
Oh, went up about a penny.

[02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:42.800]
That's bad news.

[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:47.200]
Scott says.

[02:17:48.060 --> 02:17:49.860]
And I guess Scott is confused.

[02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:50.300]
Okay.

[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:52.780]
Just like the guy that started the

[02:17:52.780 --> 02:17:54.240]
show with a picture of that really ugly guy.

[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:55.120]
Okay.

[02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:57.220]
What's sincere and deepest apologies.

[02:17:57.500 --> 02:17:59.140]
I forward this bit of scientific news to you.

[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:01.600]
Apologies for both its alluding generalizations.

[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:03.800]
And more importantly, the mind like it may have

[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:05.620]
between you and the object of your quiet affectionate

[02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:06.000]
woodbine.

[02:18:06.860 --> 02:18:08.220]
Keep up the whatever.

[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:09.880]
I'm going to love you much Scott in New York.

[02:18:11.660 --> 02:18:14.440]
It says, this is a story in the headline is

[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:16.280]
condoms too big for Indian men.

[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:17.880]
That's the goal.

[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:18.460]
I'm not a size.

[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:19.700]
I don't care about such things.

[02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:19.940]
What?

[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:22.080]
That's an old story, whether or not it's true.

[02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:23.780]
That's from BBC News.

[02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:26.640]
Well, then it must be from the BBC.

[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:30.800]
A story, a story, a survey of more than a thousand

[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:32.900]
men in India's concluded that condoms made

[02:18:32.900 --> 02:18:35.280]
according to international sizes are too large

[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:36.420]
for the majority of Indian men.

[02:18:38.140 --> 02:18:40.140]
The study found that more than half of the men

[02:18:40.140 --> 02:18:41.880]
measured had penises that were shorter than

[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:43.360]
international standards for condoms.

[02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:45.420]
I don't know there wasn't international standards for

[02:18:45.420 --> 02:18:46.060]
our penis.

[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:49.460]
And it's led to call for condoms of mixed sizes

[02:18:49.460 --> 02:18:51.560]
to be made more widely available in India, especially

[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:52.600]
if you're going to like a party.

[02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:56.940]
If you're going to like to a picnic.

[02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:00.700]
The two year study was carried out by the Indian

[02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:03.080]
Council of Medical Research over 1200 volunteers

[02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:05.140]
from the length and breadth of the country.

[02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:08.360]
So to speak, had their penises measured precisely

[02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:09.740]
down to the last silly millimeter.

[02:19:10.500 --> 02:19:12.900]
The scientists even checked their sample was

[02:19:12.900 --> 02:19:15.140]
representative of India as a whole in terms of class,

[02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:17.240]
religion and urban and rural dwellers.

[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:19.660]
The conclusion of all the scientific endeavors

[02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:22.460]
that about 60% of Indian men have penises which are

[02:19:22.460 --> 02:19:24.620]
between three and five centimeters shorter than

[02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:26.840]
international standards used in condom manufacture.

[02:19:28.780 --> 02:19:32.200]
They came up on the short end of the stick.

[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:36.160]
Dr. Shandra Puri, a specialist in reproductive health

[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:38.320]
at the Indian Council of Medical Research, told the BBC

[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:40.800]
there was an obvious need in India for custom made condoms

[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:43.380]
as most of those currently on sale are too large.

[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:46.900]
The issue is serious because one in about every five

[02:19:46.900 --> 02:19:48.100]
times the condom is used in India,

[02:19:48.180 --> 02:19:51.460]
it either falls off or tears and extremely high

[02:19:51.460 --> 02:19:52.460]
failure rate.

[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:53.280]
Oh no.

[02:19:54.580 --> 02:19:57.160]
And the country already has the highest number of HIV

[02:19:57.160 --> 02:19:58.900]
infections of any nation in the world.

[02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:00.100]
How do you like that?

[02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:04.220]
Mr. Puri said that Indians would be embarrassed

[02:20:04.220 --> 02:20:06.240]
about going to a chemist to ask for smaller condoms.

[02:20:06.540 --> 02:20:08.420]
There should be vending machines dispensing different

[02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:09.640]
sizes all around the country.

[02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:12.960]
Medium, small and extra small and teeny, teeny tiny,

[02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:14.740]
tiny, tiny, winy, teeny, winy.

[02:20:15.540 --> 02:20:16.880]
Yellow poking out bikini.

[02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:20.360]
Smaller condoms are ensue in India but there's a lack of

[02:20:20.360 --> 02:20:21.720]
awareness that different sizes are available.

[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:24.380]
There's anxiety talking about the issue and normally

[02:20:24.380 --> 02:20:26.280]
one feels shy to go to the chemist shop and ask for

[02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:28.840]
a smaller sized condom, teeny, teeny, winy.

[02:20:30.100 --> 02:20:32.040]
But Indians may need not be concerned about measuring up

[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:34.620]
internationally according to Sunil Maura,

[02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:36.920]
the former editor of the Indian version of Men's Magazine

[02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:37.440]
Maxima.

[02:20:37.980 --> 02:20:38.660]
It's not size.

[02:20:38.660 --> 02:20:39.820]
It's what you do with it that matters.

[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:42.000]
He says, from our population, the evidence is Indians

[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:42.880]
are doing pretty well.

[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:47.200]
With apologies to the poet Alexander Pope, you could say,

[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:49.900]
four inches and centimeters, let fools contend.

[02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:52.280]
I see.

[02:20:53.940 --> 02:20:55.260]
And we better do the breaker.

[02:20:55.260 --> 02:20:56.020]
We're going to be...

[02:20:56.020 --> 02:20:56.760]
Come here!

[02:20:57.820 --> 02:20:58.840]
What would you do?

[02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:07.620]
If you had to choose between the buffalo and the giraffes,

[02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:16.600]
between a flower or an elephant, what would you choose?

[02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:21.460]
What if you had to decide between a hundred-year-old tree,

[02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:25.860]
and a million-year-old beach,

[02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:33.600]
between drinking clean water or breathing clean air?

[02:21:34.560 --> 02:21:36.020]
Would you make the right choice?

[02:21:37.120 --> 02:21:38.960]
Would there be a right choice?

[02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:44.120]
Now there's a way to help, not just one but all these things.

[02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:47.580]
Earthshare, the world's leading environmental groups,

[02:21:47.740 --> 02:21:51.080]
working together, is one choice we can all live with.

[02:21:51.940 --> 02:21:55.100]
This ad sponsored by Ad Council and Earthshare.

[02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.180]
Miami Golden Sand, my outlier at games,

[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:02.580]
play on South Florida sports leaders.

[02:22:02.900 --> 02:22:04.700]
560 QAM.

[02:22:05.460 --> 02:22:06.180]
New God!

[02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:10.400]
Real American A-hole.

[02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:13.180]
Real American A-holes.

[02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:14.580]
We salute you.

[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:18.600]
Mr. I spend my weekends judging toddler beauty pageant sky.

[02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:25.260]
There's a special place in hell for people like you.

[02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:30.980]
And it's right next to the actual parents of the little Botox bloated brats you judge.

[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:33.060]
I'm 2.64 by diaper.

[02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:36.400]
The guys at the office have box seats for the big game,

[02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:40.340]
but you respectfully decline due to your previous commitment

[02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:43.940]
at the local mall Sunday at noon in front of Builder Bear.

[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:46.500]
All contestants must arrive one hour per hand.

[02:22:47.140 --> 02:22:50.220]
Interesting that you've chosen this particular line of work.

[02:22:50.620 --> 02:22:54.500]
After all, you have no children of your own and still live with...

[02:22:55.740 --> 02:22:56.380]
...mother.

[02:22:56.860 --> 02:22:58.560]
...Ely! Bring me my teddy!

[02:22:59.140 --> 02:23:04.420]
Obviously, it takes a special talent and a keen eye to discover the next John Binet.

[02:23:05.240 --> 02:23:10.660]
And let's be frank, how else are you gonna occupy your time until the FBI returns your computer?

[02:23:11.720 --> 02:23:13.320]
So we salute you.

[02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:17.040]
Mr. I spend my weekends judging toddler beauty pageant sky.

[02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:18.880]
You're curious odor.

[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:22.860]
You're recently deleted Facebook page and your aliases.

[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:26.660]
You are a real American A-hole.

[02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:29.420]
Well, good.

[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:31.520]
OK, 120 is 5.60 WQ.

[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:34.040]
I got my shirt on, my pantaloons and my shoes.

[02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:34.880]
Wow.

[02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:36.660]
And a great...

[02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:37.020]
...to your...

[02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:38.020]
...engineer's progress.

[02:23:38.020 --> 02:23:39.380]
Did you polish your head?

[02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:40.400]
Yeah.

[02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:42.360]
Now I actually have to shave my head tonight.

[02:23:43.140 --> 02:23:43.300]
Right?

[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:44.540]
Stirner, you little hairy.

[02:23:44.800 --> 02:23:46.700]
Yeah, but you like put turtle wax on there, you know?

[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:47.620]
Oh yeah, sure.

[02:23:47.700 --> 02:23:48.640]
Buff it with like a shoe cloth.

[02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:52.500]
Barb says, could you please see if honey or listen is gonna give me a ride to the doctor?

[02:23:53.740 --> 02:23:55.380]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[02:23:55.500 --> 02:23:59.840]
Now, if you look at the email address, it's Barb, it you would.

[02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:01.500]
Ha ha ha ha ha.

[02:24:01.540 --> 02:24:03.800]
My method on his way to be picked up, I live in Hollywood.

[02:24:04.220 --> 02:24:07.260]
Whenever I drive a light car, it's worse all over the road so I think I should get a ride.

[02:24:07.260 --> 02:24:08.240]
I said to pick your barb.

[02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:09.680]
My doctor is somewhere in Aventura.

[02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:10.780]
God bless you, Neil.

[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:11.140]
Barb.

[02:24:12.100 --> 02:24:13.280]
Barb, it you would.

[02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:15.120]
Cute.

[02:24:15.860 --> 02:24:18.060]
One of my best emails of that, what's that?

[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:19.880]
I've got experience in this department.

[02:24:20.820 --> 02:24:22.820]
473 on a pull, we got a shot at 500, man.

[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:25.400]
If we make 500 on this pull, which I just...

[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:27.100]
I just changed it before the show.

[02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:32.840]
That would be a real feather in our cap, especially coming up on a big anniversary show Monday.

[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:34.140]
Right?

[02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:36.140]
Now, there's one word of caution.

[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:43.600]
Oh, well, see.

[02:24:43.980 --> 02:24:45.100]
Like I said, you got to clear it.

[02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:46.880]
I didn't even get to the uncle D bag, yeah.

[02:24:47.580 --> 02:24:48.920]
T bag, uncle D bag.

[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:49.740]
I didn't even get to that.

[02:24:50.140 --> 02:24:51.360]
Well, those are just raspberries.

[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:53.240]
Right?

[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:53.700]
Right.

[02:24:54.440 --> 02:24:55.120]
Poison berries.

[02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:00.320]
Oh, so much stuff in these DCSs and so little that we can play.

[02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:01.880]
You know, some really good stuff in there too.

[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:03.900]
Some entertaining and musing stuff.

[02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:09.560]
Here's one that says, Ray, the guy from Chicago, he mealed about Burn Notice.

[02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:11.220]
It's a pretty good show on USA Network.

[02:25:12.020 --> 02:25:16.700]
It's now the highest rated show on cable TV regularly beating out even its parent network NBC.

[02:25:17.940 --> 02:25:21.960]
The real star of the show is not Jeffrey Donovan, but rather Bruce Campbell, who is great.

[02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:23.380]
I wonder if he's into Alex Campbell.

[02:25:24.300 --> 02:25:24.980]
Oh, God.

[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:30.020]
You see them filming all over, mostly in Cogon Agro, but also South Beach, Brooklyn, Hollywood, Beach, etc.

[02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:30.820]
Well, that's good.

[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:32.760]
And Jeffrey Donovan is still ugly.

[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:37.360]
He looks like what people drop in the bowl on a bad day.

[02:25:38.060 --> 02:25:43.120]
He looks like Dr. Al's ass right before they stick that tube in there.

[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:43.620]
Tube!

[02:25:44.260 --> 02:25:45.320]
Don't worry, Dr. Rouse.

[02:25:45.460 --> 02:25:46.560]
It's a piece of cake.

[02:25:48.020 --> 02:25:49.500]
It's a painless procedure.

[02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:50.840]
In fact, I had both ends.

[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.820]
I had the endoscopy and the colonoscopy on the set the same time.

[02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:54.940]
Really?

[02:25:55.400 --> 02:25:55.740]
Yeah.

[02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:56.640]
Don't you remember that?

[02:25:56.940 --> 02:25:59.640]
I didn't know that that was a, that was a part of it.

[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:01.800]
I didn't know that you had a tube in each under you there.

[02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:02.980]
Yeah.

[02:26:03.380 --> 02:26:06.140]
I had a tube in my throat and a tube in my ass.

[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:07.440]
They put you on the rotisserie, did they?

[02:26:07.860 --> 02:26:08.320]
That's right.

[02:26:08.420 --> 02:26:10.020]
And Ron Popeel was there to supervise.

[02:26:10.180 --> 02:26:12.340]
Remember that nice email I got from the fake Ron Popeel?

[02:26:12.660 --> 02:26:14.920]
Here's one from the fake, uh, Manny from Kendall.

[02:26:18.980 --> 02:26:21.380]
I went there a couple of years ago, Vancouver rules.

[02:26:21.380 --> 02:26:22.480]
He says had a great time.

[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:24.880]
Took the skywriter up to the mountain top, great restaurants.

[02:26:25.260 --> 02:26:26.640]
The Amsterdam Cafe was incredible.

[02:26:26.980 --> 02:26:28.280]
It was really incredible.

[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:29.280]
Incredible.

[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:32.340]
The ferry ride was relaxing, but boy, it was cold.

[02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:36.700]
It was November and I went there with my Canadian friend to see the 25-year reunion of the original Van Halen.

[02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:37.940]
I'll never forget the trip.

[02:26:38.100 --> 02:26:40.820]
The shrooms were great, sincerely, Manny from Kendall.

[02:26:41.180 --> 02:26:41.980]
We should live so long.

[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:48.240]
And if you look at the email address, it's Armando Kanas Feren.

[02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:50.740]
Okay.

[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:53.220]
A.K.A. fake Manny from Kendall.

[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:53.800]
I see.

[02:26:54.220 --> 02:26:55.920]
Well, I'm just, I'm just trying to interpret it.

[02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:58.920]
You know, because you're the one that teaches me that all these are fake.

[02:26:59.900 --> 02:27:01.200]
Not all, just most.

[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:02.960]
All of them, you said.

[02:27:03.380 --> 02:27:03.560]
No.

[02:27:04.420 --> 02:27:05.620]
What about Greg Budele?

[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:06.100]
Yes.

[02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:07.640]
He's fake.

[02:27:08.020 --> 02:27:08.180]
Yes.

[02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:09.740]
That's for damn sure.

[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:10.920]
Everybody's onto that.

[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:12.420]
You're fake, Greg.

[02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:13.240]
Air Zots.

[02:27:14.660 --> 02:27:16.660]
Here's one that says, oh, oh, Neil God.

[02:27:16.700 --> 02:27:19.380]
I'm listening to you right now in the inner, in their webs from my home in Pittsburgh.

[02:27:19.980 --> 02:27:22.860]
I left Miami in 1996 when you were still talking about retiring.

[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:24.340]
Thanks, Sister Mary Catherine.

[02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:24.980]
You never did.

[02:27:24.980 --> 02:27:29.140]
I just want to tell you how nice it is to still hear your voice, Oive, but loads CJ.

[02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:33.400]
That's sweet.

[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:35.660]
From Pittsburgh, no less.

[02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:38.800]
I wonder if he's ever been to Aliquipa.

[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:40.640]
Let's start talking about the Mountain Viewing again.

[02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:42.100]
Well, wherever the hell that is.

[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:43.520]
Mountain Viewing.

[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:45.200]
Well, they got that great turkey and stuffing.

[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:45.980]
Oh, boy.

[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:47.480]
Good place.

[02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:48.580]
I wonder if that's still there.

[02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:50.860]
Right outside of Pittsburgh.

[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:52.660]
You think?

[02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:53.300]
I don't know.

[02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:53.660]
I'll go check.

[02:27:53.660 --> 02:27:54.640]
I've never been anywhere anywhere.

[02:27:55.140 --> 02:27:55.960]
So that's right.

[02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:56.760]
I've never been anywhere.

[02:27:56.880 --> 02:27:57.760]
Well, you haven't.

[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:00.060]
You've been to like all these like Montana.

[02:28:00.540 --> 02:28:00.880]
Yeah.

[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:01.560]
Seattle.

[02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:02.380]
Los Angeles.

[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:02.980]
New York.

[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:03.920]
Dallas.

[02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:04.780]
Chicago.

[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:05.500]
Denver.

[02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:06.120]
Boston.

[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:07.200]
Everywhere in between.

[02:28:07.580 --> 02:28:07.900]
Boston?

[02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:08.340]
No.

[02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:08.540]

[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:10.380]
You are the only place in the northeast of Ventune.

[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:11.720]
It's the one.

[02:28:12.300 --> 02:28:13.900]
Only place in the northeast of Ventune.

[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:15.260]
Also been to Canada several times.

[02:28:15.300 --> 02:28:15.480]
Really?

[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:16.380]
No.

[02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:19.520]
New York is the only place in Montreal.

[02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:20.740]
Northeast of Ventune.

[02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:21.280]
No.

[02:28:21.420 --> 02:28:22.520]
The red necky parts of Canada.

[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:23.880]
No parlor frog here.

[02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:25.280]
No parlor froggy.

[02:28:25.340 --> 02:28:26.580]
No, the parts where they say a.

[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:29.940]
By the way, all you French Canadians, if any of you are listening, they hate you like Poison

[02:28:29.940 --> 02:28:32.780]
in South Florida and want you to go back immediately if not sooner.

[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:34.760]
What just happened there?

[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:35.960]
Oh, you know what happened?

[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:37.300]
You're not thinking of the line.

[02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:41.220]
No, I didn't knock it off the line, but for some strange reason I had...

[02:28:41.220 --> 02:28:41.720]
Oh, that's right.

[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:43.220]
I was playing that happy anniversary thing.

[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:44.580]
See how they scoot us up?

[02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:45.620]
Say, oh, new.

[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:46.140]
Yeah.

[02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:48.960]
Another tough day on the job front.

[02:28:49.140 --> 02:28:51.180]
More layoffs being an ass by another company.

[02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:54.800]
Several major companies announced layoffs this week, including Dow Chemical.

[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:55.720]
It's getting serious.

[02:28:55.880 --> 02:28:58.260]
Thousands more people losing their jobs in the weeks ahead.

[02:28:58.280 --> 02:29:02.380]
Companies announcing major layoffs and manufacturing, finance, retail and communications.

[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:04.460]
This is our moment.

[02:29:05.260 --> 02:29:06.360]
This is our time.

[02:29:07.420 --> 02:29:09.900]
Restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace.

[02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:14.580]
And I know it is wonderful world, but I can't feel it right now.

[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:20.640]
Well, I'm talking to you everywhere, but I just want to cry now.

[02:29:21.840 --> 02:29:27.500]
Well, I know it is wonderful world, from the sky down to the sea.

[02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:31.140]
Yesterday, 60,000 jobs nationwide that were cut.

[02:29:31.260 --> 02:29:33.980]
Economic forecasters say the fresh layoffs are only the beginning,

[02:29:34.240 --> 02:29:37.120]
and they predict more significant job reductions in the next six months.

[02:29:37.380 --> 02:29:39.560]
It really is grim news for the economy here.

[02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:45.000]
So let us summon a new spirit, a patriotism, a responsibility

[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:48.880]
where each of us was all to pitch in and work harder.

[02:29:48.880 --> 02:29:51.680]
And look after not only ourselves, but each other.

[02:29:52.180 --> 02:29:53.280]
Just week in.

[02:29:53.660 --> 02:29:58.100]
I can't even know that it is wonderful world, I can't feel it right now.

[02:29:59.440 --> 02:30:03.880]
I got under my clothes to wear, I just want to cry now.

[02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:11.120]
Cry now, I know that it is wonderful world, from the sky down to the sea.

[02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:13.400]
The road ahead will be long.

[02:30:14.420 --> 02:30:15.800]
Our climb will be steep.

[02:30:16.520 --> 02:30:21.880]
But America, I have never been more hopeful that I am tonight that we will get there.

[02:30:22.340 --> 02:30:26.080]
I promise you, we as a people will get there.

[02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:28.820]
We'll get there.

[02:30:28.940 --> 02:30:30.020]
131 at 560.

[02:30:30.100 --> 02:30:32.340]
There's that silly as Ali Feltching on CNN.

[02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:35.680]
You know, this is, this show is not available on Mr. Egghead.

[02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:39.340]
In town covering these South Beach one in Food Fest,

[02:30:39.480 --> 02:30:42.200]
where New York Post discovers that service in Miami sucks.

[02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:46.440]
One bad surprise that really isn't a surprise,

[02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:48.440]
service in Miami overall still sucks.

[02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:50.300]
It's like these people just can't get into their heads.

[02:30:50.300 --> 02:30:53.080]
This may be the last time they were having the local hospitality business.

[02:30:54.360 --> 02:30:57.100]
Many we spoke to at the festival complained about incompetent staff,

[02:30:57.560 --> 02:31:00.700]
concierges who didn't know where their own hotels, signature restaurants were,

[02:31:01.180 --> 02:31:03.420]
valley parking attendance, refused to listen to simple instructions,

[02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:05.420]
Velman who brought the wrong luggage to rooms,

[02:31:05.860 --> 02:31:08.860]
in over their head chefs who were fired to 10 pm during the second night of the festival.

[02:31:09.900 --> 02:31:11.600]
Based on what we've seen on recent trips,

[02:31:11.940 --> 02:31:14.400]
Eden Rock, the Mondrian on Biscayne Bay and Canyon Ranch

[02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:15.460]
will treat you better than most,

[02:31:15.760 --> 02:31:19.220]
which is to say stay away from South Beach as in the beach itself.

[02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:22.300]
One star or five star, there's something about the location

[02:31:22.300 --> 02:31:25.420]
that makes everyone exceedingly stupid you've been warned.

[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:27.240]
Wow.

[02:31:29.220 --> 02:31:31.400]
And here's this whole thing about the cockles of your heart.

[02:31:31.540 --> 02:31:32.860]
Do I want to waste my time with that?

[02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:34.680]
Now I'd rather go into this thing about Facebook.

[02:31:35.540 --> 02:31:35.840]
Okay.

[02:31:36.380 --> 02:31:41.140]
Facebook and Bebo risk infantilizing the human mind and fantasizing.

[02:31:41.540 --> 02:31:42.300]
What's Bebo?

[02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:43.480]
I don't know.

[02:31:43.820 --> 02:31:46.460]
Must be a British thing because this is from the Guardian UK.

[02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:48.800]
Okay.

[02:31:49.360 --> 02:31:49.600]
Okay.

[02:31:50.440 --> 02:31:50.840]
Okay.

[02:31:51.500 --> 02:31:53.400]
Now I'm wondering if I should go ahead with this.

[02:31:53.480 --> 02:31:53.860]
Go ahead!

[02:31:54.340 --> 02:31:54.440]
Oh.

[02:31:57.460 --> 02:31:57.940]
Woof!

[02:31:58.340 --> 02:31:59.360]
That was special.

[02:31:59.620 --> 02:32:00.000]
Yeah it was.

[02:32:00.740 --> 02:32:04.180]
Well the reason I'm looking at this is because somebody just sent it to me number one.

[02:32:04.180 --> 02:32:06.540]
And number two we have that Facebook site for the show,

[02:32:06.660 --> 02:32:10.380]
which is totally unauthorized, has nothing to do with me or you or any of us.

[02:32:10.820 --> 02:32:13.700]
And it just goes to show you whatever's on the internet's man,

[02:32:14.060 --> 02:32:15.260]
like you say, most of it's crap.

[02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:17.840]
Most of it is fake.

[02:32:18.740 --> 02:32:18.860]
Yep.

[02:32:21.180 --> 02:32:24.980]
Greenfield warrants, social networking sites are changing children's brains,

[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:28.140]
resulting in selfish and attention deficient young people.

[02:32:28.360 --> 02:32:28.520]
What?

[02:32:28.520 --> 02:32:33.940]
It says,

[02:32:34.120 --> 02:32:35.100]
Bearonis Greenfield.

[02:32:35.240 --> 02:32:36.740]
Oh this is a stuffy, brittle,

[02:32:37.740 --> 02:32:39.200]
little bit of Bearonis Greenfield.

[02:32:39.760 --> 02:32:42.640]
Social network sites risk infantilizing the mid-21st century mind,

[02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:45.200]
leaving it characterized by short attention spans,

[02:32:45.900 --> 02:32:47.520]
sensationalism, inability to empathize,

[02:32:47.800 --> 02:32:48.900]
and a shaky sense of identity,

[02:32:49.060 --> 02:32:51.040]
according to a leading neuroscientist.

[02:32:51.620 --> 02:32:53.940]
The startling warning from Lady Greenfield,

[02:32:54.160 --> 02:32:57.160]
professor of synaptic pharmacology at Lincoln College in Oxford,

[02:32:57.160 --> 02:32:59.200]
and director of the world institution,

[02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:03.660]
has led members of the government to admit their work on internet regulation

[02:33:03.660 --> 02:33:04.960]
has not extended to broader issues,

[02:33:05.300 --> 02:33:07.260]
such as the psychological impact on children,

[02:33:08.500 --> 02:33:10.120]
little children by Billie J. Kramer.

[02:33:11.340 --> 02:33:15.340]
Greenfield believes ministers have not yet looked at the broad cultural and psychological effects

[02:33:16.700 --> 02:33:18.160]
on screen friendships,

[02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:20.240]
such as Facebook, Bebo, and Twitter.

[02:33:21.440 --> 02:33:23.040]
They didn't even mention my space.

[02:33:23.300 --> 02:33:24.340]
That's old news.

[02:33:25.140 --> 02:33:30.480]
She told the House of Lords that children's experiences on social networking sites are devoid of cohesive narrative

[02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:31.760]
and long-term significance.

[02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:37.020]
As a consequence, the mid-21st century mind might almost be infantilized,

[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:38.920]
characterized by short attention spans,

[02:33:39.700 --> 02:33:42.380]
sensationalism, inability to empathize in a shaky sense of identity.

[02:33:42.900 --> 02:33:44.080]
In other words, I have no life.

[02:33:44.180 --> 02:33:44.540]
Like that.

[02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:47.960]
Which I do agree there's a lot of that going around.

[02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:51.660]
Do I really want to go through this whole thing?

[02:33:51.740 --> 02:33:52.180]
I don't want to.

[02:33:52.180 --> 02:33:53.320]
About cockles?

[02:33:53.620 --> 02:33:54.800]
No, that.

[02:33:55.060 --> 02:33:56.000]
I already threw that away.

[02:33:56.120 --> 02:33:56.280]
Oh, good.

[02:33:57.680 --> 02:34:00.960]
No, about Facebook, infantilizing the mind.

[02:34:01.660 --> 02:34:02.840]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:03.420]
It's boring.

[02:34:03.860 --> 02:34:05.340]
I think it's through intellectual tap-trap,

[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:07.640]
but plug-brits infantilized minds.

[02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:08.840]
Stuffy-ass brits.

[02:34:12.020 --> 02:34:14.780]
They still got that whole royal family crap going on.

[02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:16.560]
They're talking about infantilizing the mind.

[02:34:17.260 --> 02:34:18.040]
My God.

[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:21.200]
Talk about the popcorn to kettle pink.

[02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:28.300]
Oh, Jerry says you could only sue a restaurant for a foreign object in soup

[02:34:28.300 --> 02:34:30.780]
that couldn't be reasonably found in said soup.

[02:34:32.220 --> 02:34:33.600]
As you know that, speaking about,

[02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:36.080]
and of course, back to that thing about to make no bones about it,

[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:39.520]
no, like hair, a fly.

[02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:44.460]
For example, a large hunk of crab shell that happened to me in your childhood,

[02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:46.700]
a chicken bone, fish, spines, etc.

[02:34:47.460 --> 02:34:50.500]
However, one time I did find a duracell battery and a steak sauce.

[02:34:52.460 --> 02:34:54.240]
Luckily, I found that before I choked on it.

[02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:57.220]
However, that kind of foreign object could be caused for lawsuits, is Jerry.

[02:34:57.960 --> 02:34:59.060]
About lawsuits in Chowda.

[02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:01.420]
Why sure do you like that Chowda?

[02:35:01.540 --> 02:35:03.680]
In fact, I'm warned that this week one day we're going to, uh,

[02:35:05.460 --> 02:35:06.640]
red lobster for lunch.

[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:11.120]
I know it leaves you limp.

[02:35:11.300 --> 02:35:12.240]
Are you in the whole audience?

[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:16.620]
Well, I do take your word for it that it's different there.

[02:35:16.740 --> 02:35:17.800]
Well, let me give you an example.

[02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:22.520]
The Ruth Chris here in the Hilton Hotel is far and away better than the ones I've eaten at down there.

[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:22.900]
Okay.

[02:35:27.240 --> 02:35:29.100]
I mean, I trust your opinion about food.

[02:35:29.580 --> 02:35:30.200]
Well, there you go.

[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:33.060]
It's something I know a little bit about, not a lot, but a little bit.

[02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:34.260]
Oh, you don't know anything, Rogers.

[02:35:34.260 --> 02:35:36.920]
All you eat is red lobster and tacos smell.

[02:35:40.220 --> 02:35:42.800]
Oh, yeah, must be the Mexican influence taco smell.

[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:48.780]
Well, I'm gagging on the air in here, I think.

[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:50.740]
The artificial heat.

[02:35:52.380 --> 02:35:55.620]
Although, if Casper Ovis is listening, let me check out the latest temperature.

[02:35:57.500 --> 02:35:58.300]
Pretty chilly.

[02:35:58.300 --> 02:36:00.700]
It's sunny and in this time of the year, minus six.

[02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:02.420]
Oh, boy, not too toasty.

[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:04.320]
What's minus six about 25?

[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:06.480]
I'm looking.

[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:09.740]
Oh, God, he's dying up there.

[02:36:10.260 --> 02:36:10.620]
You're right.

[02:36:11.240 --> 02:36:12.360]
Tomorrow, though, plus two.

[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:15.360]
And Thursday, sunny and plus four, 40.

[02:36:15.780 --> 02:36:16.420]
Had LaLouye.

[02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:19.480]
Minus six is going to be like 2019, something like that.

[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:20.760]
Twenty?

[02:36:21.620 --> 02:36:22.540]
Twenty-twenty-one.

[02:36:23.220 --> 02:36:23.620]
Sorry.

[02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:24.500]
Holy crap.

[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:25.580]
It's freezing in other words.

[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:26.860]
It's still colder and crap.

[02:36:27.180 --> 02:36:28.480]
It's already the 24th of February.

[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:31.120]
Let's just kind of skate right on through March.

[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:33.460]
Let's do the anniversary show and then it'll be April.

[02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:34.420]
How's that?

[02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:35.620]
All right.

[02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:37.500]
No fooling.

[02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:38.960]
Hey, Neil, my computer is down.

[02:36:39.060 --> 02:36:41.260]
That's why email from my dad's computer and the names are different.

[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:44.200]
First, I'd like to say that I love that woman screaming willard.

[02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:46.840]
What does that mean?

[02:36:47.420 --> 02:36:50.020]
I just saw the remake of that movie with Crispin Glover and it's great.

[02:36:50.260 --> 02:36:51.400]
What woman screaming willard?

[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:52.040]
I don't know.

[02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:52.900]
No.

[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:54.480]
And it wasn't great.

[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:55.680]
The remake.

[02:36:56.060 --> 02:36:56.360]
No.

[02:36:56.700 --> 02:36:57.440]
The really good yard.

[02:36:57.720 --> 02:36:58.200]
The remake not.

[02:36:58.740 --> 02:37:02.940]
I will say, though, that the hitcher exceeded my expectations.

[02:37:02.940 --> 02:37:03.700]
It was okay.

[02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:05.660]
I wasn't going to watch it.

[02:37:05.980 --> 02:37:05.980]

[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:10.500]
And certainly the scary guy.

[02:37:10.820 --> 02:37:11.320]
What the hell is that?

[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:12.020]
Keep forgetting his name.

[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:12.720]
John something.

[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:13.760]
Writer.

[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:14.780]
John Writer.

[02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:15.280]
Very good.

[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:15.760]
Wow.

[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:17.200]
You are on top of it today.

[02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:19.180]
I don't care what they say about your stupidity.

[02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:20.580]
My God.

[02:37:21.540 --> 02:37:23.080]
He's no ruck or howard.

[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:25.960]
And the kid is sure as hell no seetown of salt.

[02:37:27.060 --> 02:37:28.220]
I made my daughter watch that movie.

[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:30.960]
She had nightmares from ruck or howard for like ever.

[02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:31.260]
Really?

[02:37:32.180 --> 02:37:34.100]
I'm actually stopped eating finger foods.

[02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:38.460]
Second, I listened to the show last week and George always does a great job.

[02:37:38.700 --> 02:37:40.160]
So you know how I voted on the pool.

[02:37:40.340 --> 02:37:41.120]
Meaning yesterday's.

[02:37:41.940 --> 02:37:44.140]
Third, I wanted to ask you in George if you ever watched the show.

[02:37:44.260 --> 02:37:45.640]
Mystery Science Theater 3000.

[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:46.260]
Yes.

[02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:47.920]
Yes.

[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:48.640]

[02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:50.740]
Where'd you go?

[02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:51.500]
Where'd you run off to?

[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:52.620]
I'm right over here.

[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:53.180]
I got a tangle.

[02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:55.980]
I'm trying to get some marty grub beads off the wall over here.

[02:37:56.120 --> 02:37:56.560]
I need them later.

[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:00.040]
It was a two hour show where a guy and two robots trapped in space

[02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:01.260]
or force to watch crappy movies.

[02:38:01.740 --> 02:38:04.260]
I thought you might like it if you haven't seen it.

[02:38:05.540 --> 02:38:06.840]
Mystery Science Theater 3000.

[02:38:06.980 --> 02:38:07.560]
Where would I see that?

[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:08.160]
Not for you.

[02:38:09.140 --> 02:38:09.460]
Really?

[02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:10.580]
Silly.

[02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:11.720]
Mr. Premier, why is that?

[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:12.900]
It's silly.

[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:14.680]
Oh, I don't like silly.

[02:38:15.540 --> 02:38:17.700]
Fourth, I want to ask George what Flea meant last week with the.

[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:19.820]
Why don't you just tell me what movie you're looking for?

[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:20.340]
Movie quote.

[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:23.640]
I saw that but it's killing me trying to remember what movie it was.

[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:25.800]
Thanks for your time, Susanthony and Tamarack.

[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:27.320]
I'm not sure what he's talking about.

[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:29.180]
Why don't you just tell me what movie you're looking for?

[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:31.720]
Come on.

[02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:33.400]
Quit holding back.

[02:38:34.300 --> 02:38:38.720]
By the way, somebody says the Broward drop is what that person thinks is Willard.

[02:38:39.020 --> 02:38:39.640]
Oh, Willard.

[02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:41.560]
Wow, really?

[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:43.400]
I guess.

[02:38:43.660 --> 02:38:44.160]
Who said it?

[02:38:45.940 --> 02:38:46.920]
I make your pardon?

[02:38:47.700 --> 02:38:48.500]
Who said that?

[02:38:49.740 --> 02:38:50.320]
A listener.

[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:52.020]
Doesn't have an aim on it.

[02:38:52.060 --> 02:38:53.020]
Wow, right.

[02:38:53.300 --> 02:38:55.040]
Yeah, it sounds like Willard.

[02:38:55.100 --> 02:38:55.220]
Yeah.

[02:38:55.600 --> 02:38:56.420]
Oh, Neil.

[02:38:56.660 --> 02:38:58.000]
You're listening to Neil Rogers.

[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:00.600]
Suck it in and hold it.

[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:05.220]
I'm Chris Badger's Welcome to Hyde Ball on M.A.C.M.B.C.

[02:39:05.220 --> 02:39:07.620]
I get so much fiddle around my food hall.

[02:39:07.740 --> 02:39:08.580]
I could water the grass.

[02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:09.760]
Quite possibly.

[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:11.700]
It's from all those years of working for tip on Neil.

[02:39:12.180 --> 02:39:12.540]
Crazy.

[02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:15.700]
The other possible reason why saliva glands are all on a whack

[02:39:15.700 --> 02:39:18.940]
may possibly be because I drink scotch from a dog's bowl.

[02:39:19.300 --> 02:39:21.780]
Traveling for too many years of working for tip on Neil Big Tony.

[02:39:21.980 --> 02:39:23.220]
That wasn't good enough smart enough.

[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:24.000]
It's skinny enough.

[02:39:24.340 --> 02:39:25.320]
Plus I got deal with it.

[02:39:25.420 --> 02:39:27.540]
Like Bill O'Rally take it shots of me every night.

[02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:29.640]
I proudly would have wailed greatest minds.

[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:31.480]
You know, my wearin' a snee-shield.

[02:39:31.860 --> 02:39:33.540]
The reason I know that people finish their answers

[02:39:33.540 --> 02:39:35.060]
is because I can't hear what they're saying.

[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:36.680]
My ears are not even hooked up.

[02:39:37.060 --> 02:39:40.020]
The constant swishing of saliva in my mouth sounds like the ocean.

[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:42.880]
The only time I truly feel comfortable is when we take hard

[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:44.160]
while out on the road, I never see.

[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:47.940]
That way I can try to convince co-edges to come back to my hotel room.

[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:51.460]
That is before they realize in order to kiss me and get close to my mouth.

[02:39:51.660 --> 02:39:53.600]
They have to be wearing a mask and a snorkel.

[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:57.380]
Many people don't realize John McKay suffered from the same malady.

[02:39:57.420 --> 02:39:59.660]
But the anti-Soliboclian's burned closed.

[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:03.440]
The environment didn't just one of the many verid and stunning differences

[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:05.400]
we like to point out here on MSNBC.

[02:40:05.780 --> 02:40:09.340]
Here's one more important fact you should realize before you go to the building booth.

[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:10.760]
They have different hair color.

[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:13.420]
I'm Chris Matthews play hard bar on MSNBC.

[02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:14.880]
Let me tell myself off.

[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:17.560]
146.14.2.2.2.

[02:40:17.620 --> 02:40:19.380]
And we got the big always back today.

[02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:22.120]
Oh, and I got a caustic thing in there.

[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:24.260]
Why don't you just die already or drink something?

[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:26.040]
I got a little frog in my throat.

[02:40:26.540 --> 02:40:30.700]
I'd like to see any of you, Jackass, talk four hours under and interrupt the nonstop.

[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:36.620]
How about we get that lot of hair in 14 minutes?

[02:40:36.620 --> 02:40:37.580]
What a great idea.

[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:42.420]
Cliff and Kendall says, Swift, return question mark.

[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:44.080]
Still claiming to be number one question mark.

[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:45.300]
Here's what's happening.

[02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:46.440]
This is about the goddess.

[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:49.120]
Randy is done at NOVA M.

[02:40:49.740 --> 02:40:51.980]
I don't know when or if she'll ever be back on here.

[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:53.160]
No one is really talking.

[02:40:53.300 --> 02:40:55.020]
I'm seeing all I'm seeing is a bunch of lawyer letters.

[02:40:55.020 --> 02:40:56.460]
It's BS. It's his cliff.

[02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:02.660]
You want to hear something positive in a good once in a while instead of this insistent drumbeat of Debbie Downer.

[02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:04.220]
Wow, wow, the sky is falling.

[02:41:04.740 --> 02:41:07.620]
Of course the sky is falling or so it seems, but we already know that.

[02:41:08.020 --> 02:41:09.980]
The bitter bus is already full. I want to get off.

[02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:11.660]
The bitter bus.

[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:16.920]
Or is one of the dissolutioned listeners' rights.

[02:41:17.300 --> 02:41:19.920]
Last time I listened to only ads on her show were for hypnotized weight loss,

[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:23.080]
vine gold or cream for women to smear on their faces while they sleep.

[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:28.360]
Do these advertisers represent the fan base that could rival that of the Oakland Raiders and loyalty question mark?

[02:41:28.740 --> 02:41:32.520]
Randy has done everything in her power to scuttle her own career by attacking fellow broadcasters,

[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:35.300]
her employers, national figures that deserve the gutter mouth,

[02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:39.460]
scorned Randy the multiple TV host who had to tell her to shut up and let someone else speak.

[02:41:41.220 --> 02:41:42.300]
Says cliff and kindle.

[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:43.060]
How do you like that?

[02:41:43.620 --> 02:41:46.320]
So she's off the air now. She keeps getting canned all over the place.

[02:41:46.460 --> 02:41:47.120]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:47.280]
Yep.

[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:49.680]
Seems to be a part for the course for her.

[02:41:49.820 --> 02:41:52.460]
Not that I'm wishing her any evil or bad or like that.

[02:41:52.460 --> 02:41:56.480]
But she just seems to be her own worst enemy.

[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:02.760]
Oh, here's a Tony of West Kendall, which I thought I had blocked him a long time ago.

[02:42:03.820 --> 02:42:05.740]
After hearing the email that rooster Chuchu said,

[02:42:05.740 --> 02:42:06.500]
you I had a respond.

[02:42:06.780 --> 02:42:07.400]
I'm sure you did.

[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:09.260]
Your show is the best talk show around.

[02:42:09.620 --> 02:42:12.780]
I thought it was unfair and outright rude for saying that George didn't love his wife or daughter.

[02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:13.940]
Daughters.

[02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:14.880]
Yeah.

[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:16.520]
I'm sure he adores both.

[02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:19.100]
I know when you say you don't care, use that as part of the show,

[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:20.540]
not describing your sensitivities.

[02:42:20.540 --> 02:42:21.940]
No, we don't care Tony.

[02:42:22.100 --> 02:42:22.500]
Right.

[02:42:22.900 --> 02:42:24.880]
Salud is how George says Tony in West Kendall.

[02:42:25.180 --> 02:42:26.100]
Thank you Tony in West Kendall.

[02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:30.220]
Boy, I think I need a couple of Snickers bars.

[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:30.980]
We'll straighten that out.

[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:31.460]
Yeah.

[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:35.960]
Especially the ones with those nasty peanuts in them.

[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:38.140]
The ones with the Sal Manella.

[02:42:38.660 --> 02:42:38.820]
Yep.

[02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:39.540]
No charge.

[02:42:39.660 --> 02:42:41.980]
Rudy says Vancouver has been called a city of neighborhoods.

[02:42:41.980 --> 02:42:43.940]
Each with a distinct character in ethnic mix.

[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:50.040]
People of English, Scottish and Irish origins were historically the largest ethnic groups in the city.

[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:55.440]
And elements of British society and culture are still highly visible in some areas, especially South Grandfell and Cariesdale.

[02:42:55.940 --> 02:42:59.620]
The Chinese have bar far the largest visible ethnic group in the city.

[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:00.740]
No Schmidt, man.

[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:04.240]
You talk about lots and lots of Chinese.

[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:04.820]
Wow.

[02:43:05.980 --> 02:43:09.900]
Also Vancouver is consistently ranked one of the three most livable cities in the world.

[02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:14.480]
According to a 2008 report by Mercer Human Resource Consulting,

[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:18.120]
Vancouver's got the fourth highest quality of living in the world after Zurich, Vienna, and Geneva,

[02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:20.500]
and ranked number one by the economist magazine.

[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:23.540]
Fourth highest quality of living in the world.

[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:27.100]
South Florida's demographics are even close to Vancouver's.

[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:27.900]
You must be crazy.

[02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:28.480]
You must be nuts.

[02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:29.580]
It says Rudy.

[02:43:30.860 --> 02:43:36.300]
I visited many North American cities including Toronto, but Vancouver would be my first choice to live if I ever moved from Miami.

[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:38.000]
But I hear it's very expensive to live there.

[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:44.740]
And a few months I'll be going on vacation to be in Austria, London, England, and Burgess, Belgium, Burgess.

[02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:46.280]
I remember Smoky Burgess.

[02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:48.880]
Have you ever been to those cities and what's your favorite? No, I've not.

[02:43:49.500 --> 02:43:52.120]
I've been to London to the airport and that's as far as I want to go.

[02:43:54.300 --> 02:43:55.520]
You've been to Burgess, Belgium?

[02:43:55.760 --> 02:44:00.180]
I never heard of such a place.

[02:44:01.460 --> 02:44:03.380]
There's Brussels and there's Antwerp.

[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:07.200]
I think that's where the term Torp came from from Antwerp.

[02:44:08.660 --> 02:44:10.000]
That's Robert Grieper, he would know.

[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:12.400]
You know the Grieper, Lord of the Board, that's right.

[02:44:14.260 --> 02:44:15.280]
So I have them into those places.

[02:44:15.460 --> 02:44:18.160]
Sorry Rudy, I can't help you out there, but I do love Vancouver. It's a nice place.

[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:24.780]
And the other people do tend to be a little red necky and lots and lots of Chinese mud, but everybody's friendly and seems very nice.

[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:29.220]
They don't give you a bat, bat, I didn't get any of that while I was there.

[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:34.580]
Oh, and I never got to this jazz mccay thing. It's a good thing I got to this.

[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:35.720]
Dad, come it.

[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:44.180]
Neil, it was nice to hear from you today, meaning yesterday, which I didn't, I guess somebody out there heard me talking about him and sent him my something, salutations.

[02:44:45.440 --> 02:44:49.560]
I'm doing great in Baker's field. I love this game because I feel I'll be safe here for a very long while.

[02:44:50.100 --> 02:44:56.760]
My GM is a big fan of mine and hired me away from KMJ in Fresno because he felt I was better suited for Baker's field in Fresno.

[02:44:56.760 --> 02:45:03.540]
He was right. My numbers are huge. Number one in a town dominated by Mexican stations and KUZZ of country station.

[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:06.120]
I beat them all says jazz mccay. See you buddy.

[02:45:06.540 --> 02:45:06.760]
All right.

[02:45:07.620 --> 02:45:10.480]
Neil, I've always wanted to thank you for inspiring me to do talk radio.

[02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:14.360]
It was because of you I left music radio to pursue my desire to talk formats.

[02:45:14.780 --> 02:45:19.260]
When I was at hot, I would listen to you every day and say to myself, there's more of this business than playing crappy music.

[02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:22.280]
I want to do that. That? Yeah, that.

[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:28.560]
It always meant so much to me when you were approval when I came to WIOD when you requested that I cover your shift when you were on vacation.

[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:34.240]
I was elated knowing that no host had ever filled in for you at WIOD to do so was an honor.

[02:45:34.420 --> 02:45:38.980]
I carried it this day. Thank you, my friend. They really meant the world of me. How do you like this? This is so emotional.

[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:39.380]
Wow.

[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:44.420]
I'm not sucking up to you. I'm serious about holding you in such high regard as a mentor. Wow.

[02:45:46.900 --> 02:45:51.740]
I don't know if you'd like my show today. I do a right wing offer conservators show with the edge I learned from you.

[02:45:51.900 --> 02:45:56.820]
But regardless, I feel you'd like my style. I take no prisoners and tell it like I see it.

[02:45:57.060 --> 02:46:02.100]
I thought prisoners. That was his audience. I believe everything I say in my show, but I don't take myself to seriously.

[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:07.960]
I had a call today who took something I did last week way too seriously. I told him this. It's only a radio show relax.

[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:13.640]
It doesn't hurt. It's just a joke. It's just a radio show that was pure Neil Rogers. That was your influence on me.

[02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:20.080]
I hope you're doing well. I wish you the best. Please stay in touch with me. Take care of yourself. I know that I love and respect you as a broadcaster and a friend.

[02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:24.880]
