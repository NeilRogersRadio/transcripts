[00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.360]
The music expressed on the previous program.

[00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.900]
Oh, please tell me I didn't just hear a storm can't tell me I was a bad dream.

[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.280]
Oh, no, Army.

[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.020]
Hey, Storm.

[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.700]
Where?

[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.280]
You're listening to sounds.

[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.400]
He's ready to hear me.

[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.820]
You're storm.

[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.300]
I'm six.

[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.180]
You're a TV.

[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.920]
I am a Fort Lauderdale.

[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.880]
Who'd rather die before you ever heard from again?

[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.960]
No, Army or Storm.

[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.540]
Oh, you're playing that as a no matter what shape your stomach is in by the big fat T-bone.

[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.160]
It was inspired from the big T-bag.

[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.660]
I got a real cost to female from T-bag ball-sax.

[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.340]
Oh, no.

[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.980]
Who just doesn't have any of his facts right, but nevertheless.

[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.700]
Just make up a bunch of stuff that only makes real sense, true.

[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.400]
For the viewers.

[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.840]
To talk to the Wii 2 and the Wii 567, Neil Adora's Rob Marcegano.

[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.200]
And then.

[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.420]
In other challenge, I will produce you nothing but evil 785,

[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.740]
Neil hit him like always on 560 on your AT&T,

[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.200]
and for rise in a wireless locky Marcegano.

[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.500]
The opinion expressed by Neil.

[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.400]
His guess on his cauliflower is.

[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.620]
Do not represent those of WQAM management staff.

[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.200]
Stormy!

[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.980]
Hey, Stormy, don't ever need a call to stay here again.

[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.620]
Call the station again, Stormy.

[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.820]
On 560, WQAM.

[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.260]
Neil.

[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.560]
Yeah.

[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.680]
Wee-ul-American A-holes.

[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.520]
Wee-ul-American A-holes.

[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.400]
We salute you.

[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.700]
Mr. Road cone placement engine.

[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.960]
Oh, that's not the bit I wanted to play.

[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.720]
The numbers are wrong.

[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.720]
I'm just just to connect.

[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.940]
God.

[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.220]
The economy is shrinking.

[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.920]
Winter.

[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.960]
Light of fire.

[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.280]
But I couldn't afford the matches.

[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.980]
Recession.

[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.800]
Shit.

[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.540]
Don't say it.

[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.960]
She covered her ears, but could still hear his voice.

[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.780]
Recession.

[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.160]
Let's go back to Morocco.

[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.080]
I can't.

[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.880]
I have a-

[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.480]
You have us.

[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.840]
Sup.

[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.700]
Prime.

[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.880]
Marguerite.

[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.660]
Recession.

[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.540]
She took it all.

[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.320]
My house.

[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.940]
My car.

[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.600]
Recession.

[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.240]
My heart.

[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.680]
You could never afford me.

[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.820]
She never said why, but I knew.

[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.840]
I have to let you go.

[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.520]
Recession.

[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.960]
She had a black heart.

[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.340]
And a pink slip.

[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.400]
Recession.

[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.340]
It's not a word.

[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.980]
It's a feeling.

[00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.700]
Recession.

[00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.980]
The new fragrance from Calvin Klein.

[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.100]
Recession.

[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.360]
Available.

[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.900]
Big Lots.

[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.420]
What's everybody wants to drink about?

[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.320]
I don't know.

[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.820]
I don't know.

[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.820]

[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.320]
10-1-560-WQ-M-Happy Thursday to you.

[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.120]
February 26th.

[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.140]
This month is almost over.

[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.940]
Thank God.

[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.180]
Then it'll be March on Saturday.

[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.340]
Isn't Saturday March 1st?

[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.620]
You bet.

[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.920]
Yes.

[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.880]
Happy anniversary.

[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.960]
Boy, you shouldn't sound too enthusiastic about that.

[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.800]
Happy anniversary.

[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.100]
Doesn't sound real-

[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.300]
Sorry.

[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.420]
I'm not quite awake yet.

[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.680]
I was speaking to pink slips.

[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.260]
You're what?

[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.420]
I said, how's it going?

[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.740]
New jobless claims rose more than expected last week.

[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.360]
The number of late-off Americans continuing to receive unemployment benefits top 5.1 million.

[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.240]
Fresh evidence to recessions increasingly forcing employers to shed jobs.

[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.020]
Everybody's out in the beach.

[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.040]
They're all fired at it.

[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.300]
The Labor Department said today for the first time request for unemployment benefits jumped to

[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.240]
667,000 from the previous week's figure of 631,000.

[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.800]
Analysts had expected this slight drop and claims didn't happen.

[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.180]
The 676,000 new claims are the most in October 82, although the Labor Department of Forces

[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.040]
grown by about half in those 17 years, but nevertheless 27 years.

[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.240]
What do you like that?

[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.220]
Bumper?

[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.460]
Not good.

[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.500]
Everybody's out on the beach.

[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.600]
Well, have a good time on the beach anyway.

[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.240]
Collect some seashells.

[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.100]
Nasdaq's up to ten point.

[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.240]
I mentioned the Dow is up to.

[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.400]
That must be because everybody's out of work.

[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.140]
The S&P, oh yeah, the S&P's up almost 12 points.

[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.500]
The S&P is up, Neil.

[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.280]
On tomorrow, of course, is Maria Bartiroma's new segment.

[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.700]
Lose your ass Friday.

[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.780]
Lose your ass in the market Friday.

[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.420]
Lose your president.

[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.340]
And the budget is more than simply numbers on a page.

[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.020]
Dow is up 101 points.

[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.640]
All right.

[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.420]
They like those unemployment numbers.

[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.960]
All right.

[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.080]
The market and the street and the street and the market and yaddy-addy-addy-addy-addy

[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.800]
are all the same.

[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.780]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.780]

[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.780]

[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.780]

[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.820]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.860]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.640]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.300]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.540]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:17.020]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.060]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.200]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.200]

[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.200]

[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.200]

[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.200]

[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.200]

[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.220]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.760]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.820]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.720]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.040]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.600]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.940]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.940]

[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.940]

[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.940]

[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.720]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.260]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.040]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.440]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:15.540]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.020]
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good start.

[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.900]
I would say a year since I've eaten a taco smell.

[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.780]

[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.360]

That's great.

[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.740]
Baper with just a couple of bills now before I read the rest of this, because you're given

[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.700]
Stephen Kredit, and...

[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.900]
But you're given Stephen Kredit, and I don't think you're going to like him so muchから

[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:55.900]

[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:55.900]

[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:56.580]
I don't think you're going to like him so much when I get to the end of this.

[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:56.820]
I don't think you're going to like him so much when I get to the end of this.

[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:56.820]

[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:56.820]

[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.140]
Would regard to the in-going George bashing normally he's just fine feeling in for you but last week he seemed,

[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:03.980]
I didn't wear a false war.

[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.100]
It's under pressure.

[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:13.380]
He's under pressure now.

[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:14.820]
George blows.

[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:17.680]
Ha ha ha.

[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.920]
could be anyone listening in any sport they like. Travelers, Georgia sports are

[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.840]
tetherball and roller skating. It's not what I said, Mr. Lier. The other thing he

[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.520]
was doing was painting some Huck Finn style portrait of his childhood. Hitchin

[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.960]
rides and pickups and waiting for the pumpkin patch to open. Yeah. Come on,

[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.060]
George. Get back to being a bit edgy. But remember not everyone thinks that

[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.340]
it's great to smoke dope and anyone over the age of 12 rides a skateboard for

[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.780]
fun is a wanker. Having said all that, still the best four hours on the radio

[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.780]
on the prices right. Love Steve. Well, thanks Steve, I guess. Yeah.

[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.680]
No, no, thanks. No, no, thanks. Good.

[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.460]
A lot of thanks to no. That's all. Get back to being edgy, George. Come on.

[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.400]
Edgy, take a flying F like Edger and James there. That football guy.

[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.700]
Any of those things he said, I said, what? I didn't say any of those things

[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.140]
that he's like the other guy. It's like I sack ball ball ball.

[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:09.020]
First, whatever his name is. Oh, Georgia door or Neil Adora's Rob Marceano.

[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.020]
And never have said that. I don't have any use for him. I've said that,

[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.080]
you know, when you get up within a hundred yards, he's ugly as sin. And number

[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:20.020]
two, he's irresponsible for going on worldwide TV and trying to debunk global

[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.640]
warming and seeing irresponsible idiotic. Obviously on the face of them stupid

[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:29.880]
things, but nevertheless, whenever you say his right, whatever I say is wrong.

[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.340]
One thing that I've learned in the show, especially since we started with the emails,

[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.200]
I mean, the phone calls are one thing, but the emails is a whole new, it's a new

[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:44.780]
Gary conduit. No, for the audience. Yes, it is. It's a new method to, oh, it's a

[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.920]
new method. All right. So let me know how. Look at this. Bonjour, Neil Rogers.

[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:56.500]
Bonjour, New CESA in frog, Femme François. New Cirions, Ravi, they will compute

[00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.060]
their parrairie. Yeah, right. And then it was so important. They sent it twice.

[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.800]
Rick says, I don't know if this is possible, but if it is, it would be great.

[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.800]
As you approach 33 years in South Florida, whatever it says, as someone who has

[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.620]
listened to most of that time, I'd love to hear clips from some of those early shows.

[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:23.800]
With that magic wand out, George, there it is. A few short clips from my with these data and

[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:29.140]
WDN snooze. A few calls from the old mating and dating show would be great.

[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.940]
We're a friend of mine hooked up with a real skank. I hope that you can. It will do this for us,

[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.160]
Neil, but either way, happy anniversary and thanks for doing what you do. In spite of all the

[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.200]
hurdles thrown at you, you still produce the most entertaining show on radio. Well, Rick,

[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.880]
I mean, I don't know how we produce. We how we get those. We don't got them.

[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.300]
Come on, Neil, you got them somewhere. You're hiding them up your ass. You got no clips and old calls

[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:57.960]
dating show and I mean, what were these people thinking about? They think this stuff just

[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:03.660]
exists somewhere like back before the days of the internet. That's right. That's going to the

[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.880]
ancient radio archives. Let's get the old callers from KAT. You'll never make it six months in

[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:13.120]
his town, Rogers. By the way, why? Speaking of that, I mean, what we do have on old reels,

[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.280]
where we're going to find a real to real machine. We are to play it. And what I do have on,

[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:23.200]
like some mini discs or something like that, we couldn't get three words into any segment.

[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:28.760]
Right. What I'm having to bleep it. Bleep it. A port bail out of it because every other

[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:34.180]
every other word. Those are the key. It's pre joy. Part sounds, things like that. BJ days.

[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.700]
Before you were there, they're they're using J more.

[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.180]
They're good.

[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.640]
He's fine.

[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:48.320]
And so we're holding a future in

[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:05.860]
Wow. Sure. It's sweet. Now like that. Let's keep playing that till two o'clock.

[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:12.560]
What do you say? Sure. Play two o'clock. We got the big O in spite of a popular demand.

[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.960]
People are lined up all the way to Ojas screaming and yelling and carrying on.

[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.280]
Maddog four to seven. Seven to seven. Thirty. We got what?

[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.040]
What does that say? The beast. That must be a typo. Yeah.

[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:33.780]
The beast because he's the program director's boyfriend. I think that the flea do something about that.

[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.720]
Get him off the air. Flea. Get that tub of turt off the air. Butch up.

[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.740]
See one thing about flea. He has good intentions, but you know what they say about good intentions.

[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.100]
Going to hell and hand basket all out of this stuff. Yeah.

[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.760]
Hurricane warm up seven thirty to wait. You and that way at university of Virginia,

[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.440]
eight thirty to ten thirty. Oh, what is it? And then the EA after that, you and basketball crap.

[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.300]
So, parents, I guess, isn't there today, right? I haven't seen him. He's in Virginia with a

[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:08.880]
banjo on his thing of banjo on his vagina. Clarence and the beast, the beast no doubt. Oh,

[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.480]
here's the poll question we got going right now. It's Brandon's if you want to blame somebody.

[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:18.180]
It's a good poll. I like it. You like it? It's fine. Let me take a look and see how that

[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.040]
new to a gene is maybe I do my fingers. I think I got like a fungal infection or something. I don't

[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:27.780]
know. Or maybe I have that skin eating disease. I don't know. Oh, hey, a flesh eating. Well,

[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:34.080]
this is going on for two, three weeks. Like roughness, skin roughness between the,

[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.540]
and it's just between the little pinky and the two fingers next to it, especially the little

[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:46.340]
pinky stinky. But it's in dry. Oh, nasty. I think it's falling off and the finger too. What

[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.640]
minor injury is the most painful? Is our poll questions speaking to that? Seven hundred four

[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.120]
vote punched in the balls. When's hands down your pants? Three, eight, four. That's what I voted.

[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:00.980]
Well, punched in the balls is like, um, you know, you hit his mag by a ball or by an object now.

[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.820]
Punched in the balls seems to me to be a little. I don't know anybody. What's punched in the ball?

[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.760]
Hit. You don't? Next time you're in town. No, seriously, nobody comes up and punches you in the

[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.740]
nuts. Not for a long time. No, but accidentally you get hit by objects and stuff. Sure. Punched

[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.460]
in the balls. Three, eight, four, winning hands down. Paper cut, 86. That's what I voted for. Oh,

[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:28.480]
there are a few things more annoying and more and real sharp pain, real like searing pain

[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:36.420]
than a paper cut. Oh, stop toe 74. Poking the eye 47. Vang d'Albo 36. Ice cream headache 35.

[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.940]
I haven't had one of those years. I wish I did get ice cream headaches. Then maybe I would need it.

[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.160]
Maybe where you say there or anything that you eat that's too cold like an ice headache,

[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.340]
like a milkshake. It's right. Too cold and all of a sudden it goes your forehead and your head

[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:53.160]
feels like it's going to explode. Oh, geez. My cup putt near to a tree. What?

[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:59.260]
Kicking the shin 23, bumping your head on something 17 cut by shaving only two.

[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.420]
Yeah, because usually if you nick yourself shaving it's like a little, although it is annoying,

[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.480]
but it's not painful. A lot of times you don't even notice it. That's right. Then all of a sudden

[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.080]
you see the little blade and you keep taking the wides of toilet paper and stuff and clean

[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.000]
x and shoving it on there and trying to leave the house without realizing that you've got blood

[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.240]
all over your chin. Oh, God, I'm burrusting. Is it? Well, there are worse things I guess like pooping

[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:30.000]
your pants, maybe. Speaking of that, I'm going to be joisting here soon. I did not. I didn't take the

[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.660]
time this morning to have a morning sit. Sit. That was right. I just didn't do it. Well, I was

[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.620]
running a little bit behind the schedule. I don't know why. Well, I'll tell you why.

[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.380]
Because I came in here and I was reading something on the internet and I was in here actually a

[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:50.880]
couple of minutes earlier than usual. And I looked at the clock and it said 827 and I thought I

[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:56.620]
haven't even I haven't even brushed my teeth or shaved or shmed or showered or anything. I knew the

[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:02.640]
S. H's. And so I got up out of my cheer here and I ran in there and did that. Brandon says it would

[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:09.640]
be nice if it was possible to hear some of that classic stuff. What I'm not understanding is there

[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.420]
are MP3s all over the internet of other hosts and shows, but of you, nothing. That's right. The only

[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:18.060]
thing of you from the old days is the audio that first day you were in Tampa hosting with Lassiter.

[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.980]
Oh, the show where you had him on. Yeah.

[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:32.620]
The show where you tried you had him on when you were trying to get him on in Tampa. Brandon's

[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:37.180]
people wanting things. Ben in his business. No, I got to find just a new one.

[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.820]
Same thing. I don't care what you call him, but they're both just super hot.

[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.260]
Oh, but you're straight. Neil, you're really straight.

[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.140]
Other than that, there's nothing. But you can listen to five million. I'm air checks of

[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.040]
gin dumb laugh. Well, it's just, you know, my career has been this handle badly, Brandon. You know

[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:59.360]
that. Oh, here we go. The fake Clarence is at us with one today. You were no longer the only

[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.980]
Rogers on QAM. I stole the great Kevin Rogers from across the street. The great Kevin Rogers

[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:09.140]
that got canned across the street. We stole him. I'm even thinking about smuggling another

[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:15.320]
Jorge to QAM. George said, honor that is. Sorry, Neil's Jorge. I apologize. That's taken me

[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:20.340]
longer than expected to get you on the Joe Rocho. Joe doesn't need another person to wipe his ass.

[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.200]
And he has three or four people already doing that. Maybe storm cack can come work in George's

[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.980]
place. I'm the Neil Rogers show. Once George moves to Joe show. Have a great deal, Neil. George

[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:37.660]
haven't okay. They signed the fake Clarence. Real funny stuff, huh? Well, here is Mr. Shun Yin. He

[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:45.320]
has a business proposal of $17 million, $300,000 for me. I think I'll pass. Probably a bad mistake.

[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.460]
See that, Neil? They're $17 million sitting there waiting right for you. You're just such a

[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:55.340]
underachiever. You're so lazy, lazy, fat old bag. I think that new Tregina is helping my fingers.

[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:04.780]
Good. Love the stuff. Do you? Yeah, what it's for dry skin? It's dry. Yes.

[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:10.340]
Well, it's a super dry winter here this year. So maybe that's what the problem is.

[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:15.640]
Maybe it's dry in the skin too. There's nothing else like it. Between those last two fingers. Oh,

[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:20.900]
well, or like you said, maybe there's a fungus among us. Could be. Now, a fungal infection. How do

[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:26.260]
you recognize one? Does it have like a name or something? I, yeah, I don't. Maybe it's got a

[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:31.420]
familiar face or something. A happy face? I don't. That's why I would have gone to a dermatologist.

[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.960]
That's what I did. I'm not going to know dermatologist. This isn't this is like just a little

[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.580]
irritation. Okay. You're like you're like one of those people every time you have a you fart

[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.540]
the wrong flavor. You run to the doctor. Okay. Yeah. That's what I have. You must have good

[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:49.060]
health care. No. No. I don't do those things, but go ahead and keep making stuff up. You don't

[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.060]
do what things. Well, you just you just said it yourself. I didn't make up the state. I said,

[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:58.140]
what do you do? If I had something that I didn't know what it was. Yeah. That's what I would do.

[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.360]
But different with something that you thought might be a fungal infection or something like that.

[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:08.140]
Yeah. A fungal infection. What you just said. Nothing except it'll dry. Mushrooms are fungus.

[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.960]
You ever had mushrooms? I bet you did. Yeah. I got some in the refrigerator right now. I got some

[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:17.020]
mushrooms. I got to talk about the kind you are. Yeah, I know. Everything George deals with is

[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.360]
always got to do with some hallucinogenic thing. You know, shrooms and this and that.

[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.920]
Like that broad said that old rich. And then the weed the weed. And then what is it the weed?

[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.340]
Nippin suds and the weed. Well, that's because suds was in there in Friday.

[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:37.760]
Apparently we brought you a big bag. That's right. A food. A lot of it. It's got a day and about an hour

[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.320]
I bet from the kick sound. I'm going to pass it. These are two for one deal. As a matter of fact,

[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.720]
I'm segwing it to the spot right now. Good for you. Nice.

[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:53.880]
Where you fudge pack and remember when remember when we fight net now. Yeah. Dems with a salad

[00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:00.380]
toss in days like the time you root my face Joe. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the premiere.

[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:06.420]
What a more thing, but a show. A delightful. I was of entertainment and information to help you get

[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:11.320]
through your busy day today. Actually, you know, yeah, I'm just going to talk about sports.

[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:18.120]
Here's the scores and seven or two seven or three. How about the dolphins? Blah blah blah. Hey,

[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.180]
what are you doing? Walking through here in the middle of my show. I was looking for the NFL.

[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:27.240]
Can't you buy what are you thinking? Walking through my show. I don't know. I don't know.

[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.660]
Like this and the background. What the fuck is it with you? That kind of language is going to get

[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:36.360]
you ready. Do you know who I am? I'm bold. David. And that's the

[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.720]
distracting. See? Having someone walk through the middle of my show.

[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:46.720]
Do you have a. I don't understand. What don't you understand? Did it? I just don't know why we need

[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:52.440]
another sports show. I mean, what else can you say? There's only so much to talk about. You know,

[00:23:52.540 --> 00:24:00.060]
or invite wake up. I hit that last piece of pizza pie in the back room. Good for you.

[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:10.000]
It was tasty too. Was my name on the. Box. Yeah, it said right there. Most pizza. Get out of my studio,

[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:15.260]
Bob. All right. Let's get the show back on track. Can I just take a second here? I'll give you a

[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:21.080]
second. I'll give you two seconds. And you better use them to get the hell out of here. I don't

[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:26.580]
understand why they. You don't understand what it's like working with professional broadcasters.

[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:32.040]
Is that it? Well, he had called yourself a broadcaster, but you're not really a broad.

[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:38.720]
I don't wonder about that. Thanks for running my show. I enjoyed it. Why don't you turn it a little

[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:58.920]
like you? Oh, yeah. Then why you're spooning me? 1032 at 560 WQ. There's a little something for

[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:04.680]
your lunch. Some spooned mo. Oh, sounds grotesque. Oh, it's big. Grotesque. So dug the fake

[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.640]
dog says when my stepson was a little kid five years old, he had a fight with his mother. And

[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.760]
when I walked in from work, he punched me in the balls. That was 20 years ago on my ball still.

[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.560]
So yes, you can be punched in the balls. Thanks to fake dog. PS happy analversary.

[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:26.080]
Well, what time is Doug show on? Really? He's got some material here. Happy analversary. That's

[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.660]
really cute. Yeah. I go. There are phase when you and your friends thought it would be funny to

[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:36.840]
smack each other in the nuts. No, like in elementary school or something. No, it was popular.

[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.820]
No, wow. You're lucky. You. I mean, I'm not saying that there wasn't a phase that I went through

[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:45.500]
when I didn't want to grab some of my friends nuts, but that's for different reasons. No.

[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.920]
What do you mean? No, there was a time there when kicking, punching, throwing something in the nuts.

[00:25:51.040 --> 00:26:00.640]
At each other's crutches was a funny thing to do. Well, I'll be damned in elementary school. When

[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:06.800]
there's a lot of that nut punch and going on. Yeah. Major and Rick say cleaning up the home page.

[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.400]
Oh boy, cleaning up the home page. I'm looking at my fingers and I think that stuff is helping

[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:16.560]
the nutrient. Gina, good. I love it. But it does. It does nothing for like a fungal infection.

[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:23.880]
No, but you just might have a bad dry dry skin. Dry skin. It's really, really dry. Well, why would it

[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:29.120]
be like, especially in one spot? I don't understand that. No, neither. When you're the expert, no,

[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.400]
I'm not a there. You are. You're the dermatologist. Yes, I'm the one who's saying that. That's right.

[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:39.100]
I have a degree of song to dance and punching my pants. Anyway, Rick says, come on, Neil. There's

[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:43.460]
so much old crap there. Get Eric to clean it up and make it more current. Come on, Neil.

[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:49.600]
There's so much old crap. And can I give you an idea why there's so much old crap on there?

[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:54.200]
Okay. I don't care. Oh.

[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:54.300]
Oh.

[00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:01.860]
Guess who taught me not to care me? Yes. Excellent. Well, I mean, no, seriously, the home page. I put

[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.260]
all those damn news stories on there. And even when I was on vacation last week, you'll notice,

[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:10.060]
and you're very welcome, by the way, that I filled the breach and did all the new bedtime stories.

[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:15.020]
I thank you from the cockles of my heart because I know you hate doing that. Do it. It's a fair amount

[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:19.620]
of words. My eyes. Oh, here's Chuck in Chicago again. Who thinks that what's his name?

[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:27.520]
I think that the fatty arbuckle's a handsome guy. Have either of you seen the documentary called

[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:34.020]
Mirror Wanna Ink? No, I have not. Maybe George has. I don't know. I saw the CNBC recently. Yeah,

[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.880]
I know it's the damn gambling channel, but it was a pretty good look at the business of weed

[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:42.220]
and presented some good arguments. Why should be legal? Well, thanks Chuck in Chicago so much.

[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.760]
That's a big improvement over your idiotic thing yesterday about how that really ugly guy is so hot

[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:54.380]
and your wife got the hot form. Fred and Vokas says, I was in the Palm Beach,

[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:59.020]
Kendall from Friday during the fourth race. The wife said, oh, the wife. There's another guy who's

[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:04.360]
got the wife, the kid, the dog. The wife said the seven dog just took a dump at on him. So I put

[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.200]
50 bucks on him. He let all the way around the track paid 437.50. Can you beat that?

[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:19.020]
Because the dog took a dump. What a great system. See, there's two schools of thought on horses.

[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.260]
If the horse takes a dump like just before it's going in a starting gate. Yeah,

[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.060]
there's the school of thought thinking, oh, now the horses have relaxed. He's not going to run

[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:32.940]
with such a sense of urgency. The other thought is, oh, yeah, oh, I don't know. Listen,

[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:37.900]
yeah, is there any denying that you're more that you're lighter on your feet after a good

[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:44.600]
choice later on your feet? Yeah, but if you if you got to go really bad, you might run like a son

[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.860]
of a bitch too, you know, so you can stop you. I don't think horses, even with their magical

[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:53.420]
ability during the course of a race can like lift their tail and drop a load. I could be wrong. I

[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:59.260]
don't think everybody always feels better after a good choice. Well, let me go do one now. I don't

[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:04.600]
have to do one now though. I could go in there and sit and try and come back around 145,

[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:10.460]
let you know how I made out. Please. Jay in Miami says, Neil, it's time to stop referring to

[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:17.580]
Governor Jindal is Bobby Jindal. Yeah, we know his name is Paiush. Say it. Paiush Jindal. Paiush,

[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:24.320]
say it. He never legally who cares? Who cares? He's an idiot. He's a dangerous moron. A right

[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:33.580]
wing lunatic. George Jans says, as I get older, my sack gets longer and I tend to sit on it more,

[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:38.980]
man that hurts. I was listening. I always listening and love the show. I always listening. Good.

[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:48.220]
I always like her with her painful sack. Very jackass says, oh, here we go. Learning more about

[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:54.700]
the new Fox Sports 940 lineup. Oh, I'm going to have to do a choice now. Besides Jim Roman Dan Patrick

[00:29:54.700 --> 00:30:00.440]
from Fox Sports Radio, they'll take Mike and Mike from ESPN before they take Fox Sports Radio

[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:07.160]
AM Drive Programming and see Clear Channel will allow it. I got a Jewish bad now to your fault. I don't

[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:15.160]
let me oh, I don't need any likes. I don't need any likes. I've got to do a normal night tour and

[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:19.100]
let me check my fingers out and see how they're doing. Well, the little one doesn't itch anymore. I

[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:26.440]
think it's that new Trajina. Well, it's 2000 for Clear Channel 0790, the animal KMBE ran Mike

[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.620]
and Mike and ESPN radio. Oh my god. This goes on through a lot of convoluted crap that nobody

[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:36.060]
cares about. The programmer on the station in Houston was named Ken Charles. The programmer in charge

[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:41.920]
of W.I.N.Z. is Ken Charles. I see Mike and Mike is the ESPN jewel and they get numbers in most

[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:47.480]
markets. Ken Charles is a long time tube channel soldier will take Fox Sports Radio, but we'll get

[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.240]
what he wants in the AM, which is Mike and Mike. If they force him to take anything, it'll be

[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:56.500]
silly. Oh god, help us because they can play it off as local regional like they do with smith and

[00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:04.640]
I.O.D. says the fake very jackass or maybe the real one. I don't know. Oh, Adam Oshmac who's gotten

[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:11.300]
less than a life. He always points on the life scale. Your dry skin may be eczema. Maybe I should

[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:17.320]
get some nagsima for your next. I'm for my eczema or I could smear some nagsima on my

[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:22.160]
back home before I go into a choice. I don't know anything about eczema. And I know I know

[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:28.700]
nagsima smells like crap. It's bad nasty stuff. You don't like the smell? No. Nagsima. Yeah. I like it.

[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:33.900]
Who? Anyway, Adam had it bad as a kid. The one crime of the South Florida really seemed to help

[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.380]
it. Maybe an appearance of Gulfstreamers or I know it is not. I'm not going to eat one

[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:45.420]
time and I'm not going anywhere. Adam. Fures. Fake Larry Kane says the Rick Riley still my briefcase

[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:50.180]
song was in my head when I woke up this morning. What does this mean? It means you need serious

[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:54.720]
ass instances. What it means? It means time for somebody to clean out the old bag, Larry.

[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:04.000]
I Chris Matthews. Welcome to Hydebond. I'm a sempercy. I get so much fiddle around my

[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.020]
food hall. I can water the grass quite passively. It's from all of us years of working for

[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:12.740]
Kippo Neil. Crazy. The other passable reason I should lie. It glans are all out of whack.

[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:17.400]
May passively be because I drink scotch from a dog's bowl. Bradley from too many years of

[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.480]
working for Kippo Neil. Big toe. That wasn't good enough. Smotted up for skinny enough. Plus,

[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:25.500]
I got deal with it's like Bill O'Riley taking shots of me every night. I probably would have

[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:30.040]
watched greatest minds. Get on my wear it. Sneeze shield. The reason I know that people finished

[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.680]
their answers is because I can't hear what they're saying. My ears are not even hooked up.

[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.460]
The constant swishing of saliva in my mouth sounds like the ocean. The only time I truly feel

[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:43.040]
comfortable is when we take hardball out on the road on MSNBC. That way I can try to convince

[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.560]
co-waves to come back to my hotel room. That is before they realize in order to kiss me and get

[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:52.480]
close to my mouth they have to be wearing a mask and a snorkel. Many people don't realize John

[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:58.160]
McKay suffered from the same malady. But the 80 saliva glands burned closed. The environment didn't.

[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:02.420]
Just one of the many varied and stunning differences we like to point out here on MSNBC.

[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.900]
Here's one more important fact you should realize before you go to the Veldig booth. They have

[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:12.140]
different hair color. I'm Chris Matthews play hardball MSNBC. Seven quick hits during the bonus

[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:18.640]
game on quick hit. Wow. 1044 there's that Bill Bennett that I'm not just sped. De-bagged.

[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:24.760]
Good teachers. Oh my god. I was thinking that we might never see him again but I wouldn't bet on

[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:30.260]
it. Surprise. Oh I get that that was Joe. Bob says allow me to briefly express some father to

[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:37.500]
father man love for George. This is before Rooster 2 2 rips you an ass. Oh you're the topic

[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:41.580]
to sure now every day you're the topic of conversation you filled in for a week last week and

[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:45.940]
you've done it a million times but this particular week seems to have really turned the audience into

[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:54.860]
a bunch of lunatics. Yaw yaw yaw. In 2005 or 6 George was discussing an educational website startfall.com

[00:33:54.860 --> 00:34:00.760]
that his kid used in George recommended. Starfall. What did I say? Start to fall.

[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:10.420]
Starfall.com that's what I said. Okay. Starfall.com. I think that 2 2 is right. Yeah. He liked it since

[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:13.760]
and progressed in difficulty level as the child developed more advanced reading computer skills.

[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:19.600]
Well I got my kid hooked on it and it's great. Not only that but I had an occasion to visit our

[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.460]
local elementary school so that students there are also using this site. Thanks George you rock

[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:33.740]
what's your kid into now. Sign language and skateboarding. And drugs. But other than that. Why would

[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:39.560]
you say such a thing? Just a joke. Jesus you're so tight that one guy was right to the day. Yeah

[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:44.940]
whichever whichever one of the ads or whatever made up a crap chronic. You mean made up like Rooster 2 2?

[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:50.900]
Yeah exactly. Rooster Crabburn. Subbed to go play Tea Party. That's for you later on.

[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:56.820]
Now let me read the first line and let's see how illiterate this is. You claim that all I ever do

[00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:03.300]
is be critical and not provide any substantive advice. All I do is be critical. All I be is do critical.

[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:07.840]
I mean that's illiterate. Well here it is Neil. I really like it when you use drops to finish sentences

[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:12.880]
and thoughts. However the drops are very old and played out. When was the last time you got to

[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.360]
drop from a caller? I don't know because we don't take calls and I'm very happy about that. I don't

[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.780]
apologize for it. I never realized how enjoyable my life could be without taking. I'm your friend.

[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:25.120]
I'm your friend. I'm just sitting here being exasperated for four hours every day because of the

[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:32.620]
fact that this company is a bunch of the lung kids. Things that other radio stations things that

[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:37.840]
other broadcasting companies do without breaking a sweat. This company is like oh geez I don't think

[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.020]
we know how to do that. I don't think that's possible Neil. Yeah and next time you're buddy Joe

[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.540]
Bell by the way. So you just another one of those stupid telephone conference calls. Tom to blow

[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:52.440]
it out is fat ugly ass. When was the last time you got to drop from a caller? Don't remember either.

[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.540]
That was part of the charm of the show you tear somebody a new ass then their calls or phrases

[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:00.060]
would become part of the show for a while. You know that's interesting because I don't think I'm dying

[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:06.700]
out of here. Is that got to do with tearing somebody in ass? No or absolutely correct. Does that

[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:15.680]
have to do with tearing somebody or that? No none of them or even I also like the celebrity drop.

[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.920]
So it's the last time you got one of those. I know callers can be obstructed to a good show but

[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.040]
give your producer something to do. Make him scream the phone calls. Well guess what we technically

[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:28.640]
are capable of doing that. Am I still right about that or not? Yes I don't have the physical

[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.060]
meaning. He doesn't have the ability to do that so we don't have anybody who can screen the calls.

[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:38.400]
Mr. Expert Chuchu. He can return to his real position on the show glorified board op. I don't

[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.880]
know what he ever has produced for the show. He doesn't book guests. He never fixes any of the

[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.080]
technical problems with your current regular basis. What does he do? He takes a paycheck every

[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:50.500]
couple of weeks like I'll just about everybody else does. I got a few free meals and he gets a

[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:56.320]
free meal like today that's coming to Kex South in about 45 minutes maybe an hour and he'll enjoy it

[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:02.260]
profusely. So according to Georgie boy I'm a fat shud in these somehow superior to me. I decided

[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.620]
to look him up here state to find out what he looks like since he has such a high opinion of

[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:10.280]
himself not a pretty picture Georgie. I mean you talk about somebody with no life. That's busy

[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:17.240]
looking up on my face face or whatever did see what you look like. Yeah I am. Something and you

[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.780]
look like you're 60. Yeah that's an objective observation by the way. People will live in

[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:27.020]
glass houses shouldn't throw stones that why would anybody who has the life you do and looks like you

[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:38.280]
be so pedantic. So what he said what what does pedantic have to do with I don't know. You look like

[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.000]
any other middle-aged man who has lived up to his own minds expectation if anybody out there's

[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.240]
ever been insulted by Georgie should look him up on my space you claim to be popular with girls

[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:50.860]
the girls in your house maybe like I said before go play tea party with your daughter and shut up

[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:55.280]
your an impediment to the show says rooster chuchu who the other day didn't like the show and

[00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:01.320]
doesn't like what I do they don't like anything. Just an idiot trying to be a John ZTR and falling

[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:07.280]
way short by the way starting out with any literate sentence. You claim that all I ever do is be critical.

[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:18.340]
Do you understand that? You've been that all I ever be is do critical. Well whatever. Oh I forgot

[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:24.460]
the mentioned ranges ranges for all the obnoxious New Yorkers and their ranges. Leafs beat him again

[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:30.620]
and overtime two to one last night. Let's shoot out two to one twice in three days how do you like that

[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:38.940]
a. But I don't want to get too hockey intensive but this is some really bad news and it appears

[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:42.360]
out what it appears out what I've said about how sick these people are here with their maple leaf

[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.620]
of hysteria or their obsession and this coming from somebody who's been a fan for 50 years but

[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:52.500]
realized when the team blows and stinks and sucks and just blows chunks the organization.

[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:58.020]
This is from a city news it says leaf ticket price hike angriest fans

[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:04.380]
guess which team in the national hockey league is the highest average ticket price anyway.

[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:11.260]
Do I have to Toronto make believes 95 out of 33 cent. Panthers are down in the middle somewhere

[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:17.800]
65 86 imagine a business that underperforms your expectations disappoints you at almost every turn

[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.840]
leaves you in the lurch year after year and has a virtual monopoly on the service they provide.

[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:27.040]
Now imagine that they decide to raise their prices despite that dismal track record by the way

[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.640]
you'll be pleased to know I had a very enjoyable choice very good I was waiting for that report.

[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.740]
Most of us would react to that in an outrage about never to darken their door again but when

[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:39.740]
you find out the businesses the Toronto Maple Leafs it puts the scenario in a whole new light I

[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:44.800]
wonder if they're showing on leafstv and the highlights of last nights went over the ranges.

[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:49.220]
Josh do they open in 11 and a half minutes. Oh it's Chris Cufford and the obnoxious needs to be killed

[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:55.640]
up here McGuire he needs to be put to sleep. Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa

[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:04.060]
The color commentators on sporting events man most of them need to be shot especially PR McGuire first and foremost.

[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:13.460]
For years fans are complaining the list list list and often lifeless Leafs have failed to put together

[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.660]
a winning team and they look certain to miss the playoffs for the fourth straight year there's

[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:20.980]
no doubt about that many believe that I like the baseball movie field of dreams if they don't build it

[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.920]
you'll still come. Leaving them no one set up to force any improvements that's the hole

[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:29.240]
motorcycle brand I hear. No matter what kind of swirly put out there on the ice, these

[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:34.280]
suckers will continue paying big bucks and showing up. It's one thing to be loyal, it's

[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:38.960]
another thing to be stupid. That's just one notion for Lee's nation, but the news that

[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:44.120]
the team is hiking prices 8.6% next year in the middle of an economic turn down has many

[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:50.120]
left feeling angrily confused. And yet you still can't get a ticket in this town. The

[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.680]
least of long sport of the highest price of the mission of any team in the league with

[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:57.160]
Montreal Boston ranges coming in 2nd, 3rd and 4th. It's the only place the buds have

[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.900]
finished first and decades and not exactly an accomplishment. The buds. The leaves claim

[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:06.280]
they didn't make the decision lightly. No time is a good route. A time admits chief operating

[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.960]
officer Tom and Selmy. We gave it a lot of thought. Asked a lot of our fans to spend

[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.280]
a lot of time thinking about it. And they said, yeah, sure. They'll pay it. Yeah, sure.

[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.220]
You have any other NHL teams who have already confirmed their freezing their prices for

[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:21.920]
next season to get fans of badly needed break in the midst of a recession when money is

[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:26.520]
tight. But a few are more long suffering than those in this city. The team is not good

[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:30.180]
complaints fans. Susan Davies. They need deliver on the ice. I wonder if she's can't

[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:35.800]
I can do a bud Davies dead babies. I'm tired of watching when the Susan says not a very

[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:40.060]
good team, but a very big price tag. And then it's got a list of the average ticket prices

[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:49.180]
yada yada. George, I see I think we lost George. Oh, right here. St. Louis Blues are

[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:53.520]
last in like 37 49 to go see the blues. You want to go see them? And maybe John Davidson

[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:58.140]
will talk to you. Papa, Papa, Papa, Papa, Papa, Papa, Papa, Papa, Papa, Papa, Papa,

[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:03.540]
Pierre McGuire. I'll do it myself. I'll shoot him. That was up one on nine, by the way.

[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:08.880]
Aren't you excited? That's the Obama balance. Maria, Maria Bartiroma will tell you. Oh,

[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:15.200]
you're so lovely today, Maria. Maria, you look like diarrhea. That's what you look

[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:20.960]
like and probably smell like too. She blows. Oh, you know, you who has never has never

[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.160]
written anything meaningful, constructive, useful. I'm going to stop reading his crab.

[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:31.860]
He ends this one by saying still no life. While watching American cattle last night, I couldn't

[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:36.500]
help but notice the resemblance between Simon Cowell and mancolder. They both have the

[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:40.160]
same attitude and rule their eyes like mental patients. Simon is more feminine. I'd like

[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.840]
to give Mr. Coder a good-ass kicking says still have no life. Oh, you Shmoi, Shpendrick.

[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:51.300]
Off to Laughas, baby. That's my commentary on you. Off to Laughas. Excellent. Now that we know

[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:55.560]
what it means. Now that we're positive, we don't know what it means. Whatever it means, it's him.

[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:01.640]
Oh, you Shmoi. Seven hundred seventy-four votes on the pool. Well, we got a shot today at

[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:06.640]
something. Happy anniversary, Uncle Niel says Chuck and Chicago who won't stop writing.

[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:11.740]
Papa, Papa, Papa, you're like the Pierre McGuire of the Internet. Thanks for the many years of entertainment.

[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:22.760]
Chent-O-Ani. Chent-O-Ani. Hundred years. Well, what does that mean? Chent-O-Ani. Hundred years? Man,

[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:27.160]
know what it means, but what's the point? I don't know. I agree. I may be lighter on my feet after

[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:32.160]
dropping a douze, but some of the fastest sprints of my life have been from the car to the throne.

[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:39.680]
Could compete with some of the juxtaphan at the combine after a few sorbetal candles. Oh, candies.

[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:49.820]
Can we light up a sorbetal candle this morning? Oh, the following is a graphic,

[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:55.340]
intensive presentation may take a while to load from the Feg Tom Jicca. Talkers hot 100. Oh,

[00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:01.320]
it's got the whole, the whole list and all the graphics and all the pictures. Aren't you excited?

[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:09.080]
No. David Gravy line is on here. Did I just imagine that or I don't think I saw that. Yeah,

[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:13.220]
number 98, David Gravy line, the advanced radio network. So you know, it's coming from him.

[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:21.420]
Neil Rogers, 89 South Florida talk radio institution, mid-mornings on sports outlet. That's all it says.

[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:28.860]
Mid-mornings on sports outlet. In other words, do the break. So this is the Neil Rogers show.

[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:34.600]
Oh, rock rock solid. Is this your brain? Any questions?

[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:41.480]
We all know blons have more fun and the blunder you are the better time you'll have.

[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:46.780]
That's why this station is going to make you as blonde as you can get because this station is going

[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:53.480]
to make you an albino albino. Pink, I'd and pretty. That's right. We'll leech all the pigment out

[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:58.340]
of your skin with corrosive chemicals. Then we'll bleach your hair with exposure to ultraviolet light

[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:04.420]
until your eyes turn pink and blister all in the name of summer fun. Be the tenth column when you hear this

[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:11.520]
sound and you'll be an albino albino station employees and their families are not eligible to become

[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.540]
albino's. Johnny and Edgar Witter and other real albino's are also ineligible because this

[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:21.200]
procedure will render them transparent. Blons have more fun but albino's have the most fun of all.

[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:25.280]
People listening for your chance to win. Okay, it's 1101. You're lunch ought to be there in about

[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.520]
a half an hour. There are bouts. Hope so. From Karystown. What are they bringing? Did you have any idea?

[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:33.320]
I don't know but I hope so. And when Alice Steve Sloan going to send me the entries for the

[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:38.640]
Erased Tomorrow for Augustine. What's going on in this place, man? Oh please. Talk about schlock.

[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.140]
Listen, stop expecting stuff and you'll never be disappointed.

[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.200]
I'm looking on here. I don't see anything from I don't even see the thing whatever you've got from

[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:53.820]
Steve Sloan. No, apparently he didn't send that to you. Oh and here's a picture of here's a bunch

[00:45:53.820 --> 00:46:02.100]
of pictures of Miami. Oh God, I'm just it's so breathtaking. You know something?

[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.600]
What? Chuck Einschekaga. We're going to send a hitman to find his ass.

[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:12.780]
We're going to call up what's his name? Blog, Blog, Blog, Way of Itch.

[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:20.880]
From Godfather to it was the toast they gave something like 100 years. Yeah, something like it.

[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.960]
Just to wish you have a happy 100. Go away Chuck.

[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.840]
Fredo's drunk girlfriend had a habit of explainer. Let me explain some of the you Chuck.

[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:35.280]
Your chronic to the point of obnoxious. Obnoxious. What did I tell you before about some of these people?

[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.420]
If you acknowledge their existence, they think that the show is going to become just a running

[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:43.600]
dialogue between you and them back and forth and forth and back and up and down and pop pop pop pop.

[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:48.220]
I like to appear McGuire syndrome. Do you know what I mean? Yeah.

[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.500]
Do something constructive. Okay. When the middle of a friggin depression. Do something

[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.620]
instructive. God, all might instead of sending me a bunch of stupid crap. I thought his one

[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:02.220]
yesterday would have ugly guy at Jeffrey Donovan or whatever his name was. I thought that was bad.

[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:08.960]
That was pathetic. Oh, my wife has the same taste as you. This is what cracks me up is that all

[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:13.020]
these listeners, not all of them, but just so many of them. They think that because they listen to

[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:16.960]
a radio show, they know what you're thinking about, what I'm thinking about, what your attitudes are.

[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:23.080]
This is a radio show for Christ's sakes. That's all it is. This isn't my life. This isn't even

[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:30.620]
a little George's life. Thank God. But for some of you who have a problem, I have no life. That's

[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:34.740]
it. It's their life. It is your life. It isn't our lives. It's our job. And so sending stupid

[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:38.140]
email, I mean, keep the emails coming. Believe me, we need a thousand of them today. Neil

[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:43.860]
at Neorodges.com, any IL. Got to spell it for him. And you think with my big anniversary,

[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.360]
coming up on Sunday, since I'm not going to be doing a show on Sunday, obviously, it takes

[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:54.860]
since March versus 33 years on the air in South Florida, 33 long suffering years working for the

[00:47:54.860 --> 00:48:05.040]
most part for a bunch of derelicts, bunch of dinkheads, dorkheads, mung brains. You think that maybe

[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.920]
we'd be getting something like that, you know, I had one or two. I don't want any wishes from

[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:14.800]
you, Chuck and Chicago. We just go away. You're annoying. Isn't he annoying? Oh, yeah.

[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:19.320]
So you know what I'm saying? They want this show to be an on running back and forth dialogue,

[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:23.800]
like rooster or chuchu, chuchu head, whatever his name is. Look, you might as well read the best

[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:29.820]
boards out loud and all four of them and all the message boards out loud. It's the same crap out loud,

[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:35.620]
out loud. Oh, words, there it is. See, George is putting down the emails. I like the emails.

[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:41.940]
You do have calls. I'll do the emails. Fine. I don't want to do the emails. I'm not the same

[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:44.660]
people at least you know who you're talking about. I don't care. At least with the emails,

[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:49.260]
I have more control over it. I don't want to get exasperated with emails like I do with that

[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:53.740]
stinking phone. I'm your friend. Hi, Bob. Hi, Rob. I mean, if that's what you want to do,

[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.500]
is hand the show over to a bunch of four misfits. That's fine. At least I got about 10 misfits on here.

[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:04.140]
Now, you're right, probably the same four, like Chuck and Chicago. How do we know Chuck is in Chicago?

[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:11.220]
Huh? We don't. Chuck could say he's in Ipsilanti for all we know. And you know something as far as I'm

[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:15.340]
concerned, he ought to be. He ought to be an ishbimming Michigan. That'd be a perfect place for Chuck.

[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:22.980]
Just on and on and back and forth and on. This is a guy supposedly works for a living. I think homeless.

[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:30.320]
He's probably sitting on one of those computer joints, you know. Right. Those are not cafe joints.

[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:34.780]
At the library using the library because obviously you don't have to pay at the library like all the

[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:39.640]
homeless people. That's what they write homeless. And you'll be pleased. Now I shaved my head last night.

[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.940]
I do not have. At least I don't think I have a Mark Lindsay ponytail hanging down on a little garage.

[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:52.660]
Now I did it all on my own. Now, this is a really bizarre email. It says was just down there

[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:59.080]
driving up and down a one a in US one throughout date, Rowerdon Palm Beach. Just driving up and down

[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:05.000]
the road. Without a doubt, the ugliest stretches of both roads are in Broward. It is mostly beautiful in

[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.860]
Dayton Palm Beach. Even the formerly ugliest stretches of A1A and Data are now nice. Also, I was out

[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:14.800]
western year old area driving around by the Saga grass, Bank of Atlantic, etc. in the new area,

[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:20.040]
the new Ikea. It's really quite beautiful out there, although very suburban. You must have had

[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:25.140]
some really bad neighbors to have hated it. Now, I don't hate it out there. I don't hate West Broward.

[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:28.580]
I don't hate where my house is. I don't hate where the Saga grass is. I hit the traffic,

[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:34.000]
but I don't hate it out there. Now, I do have a couple of crazy neighbors, but I don't really

[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.860]
pay that much attention in the neighbors anyway. So that has little or no influence over my

[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:44.860]
view of South Florida. I'm talking about South Florida as a whole that spelled HOLE whole.

[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:50.480]
But this is a guy again trying to do a sell job. Oh, it's so beautiful. Well, great.

[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.780]
I'm happy that you're happy. If you're happy, that's all it counts.

[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.840]
What do you think about my fungus? And what is Exima? Anyway, you know that Adam Oshmak,

[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:03.660]
who sends me another thing here about I'm going to tear it up. I'm tear it to him.

[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:10.660]
He's another one like the guy from Chicago Chuck, back and forth and on and on and on and on and

[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:16.960]
never stops just to run in commentary. So if he had Exima, why does he tell me what you do for it?

[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:21.000]
Do you know what you do for Exima? I don't know. The skinny retagents, for sure.

[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:25.740]
Right. What do you do for it? I don't. He'll go see a dermatologist.

[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:29.760]
I'm not going to go see a freaking dermatologist. Okay. Maybe there's one in the audience.

[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.640]
Jesus, you talk about a hypochondriac.

[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:37.180]
I'm not going to go see a doctor for something this minor. It's like a little

[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:40.400]
a little skin irritation. We're asked to question. Oh, go see a dermatologist. What?

[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.720]
You asked a question about something on your skin that I don't know the answer to.

[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:46.720]
Yeah. They're the ones who do know the answers.

[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:52.780]
Why don't you go see a dermatologist? Why don't you go see a psychiatrist? Oh, yeah.

[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.480]
Look who you're working for. I think you need one. Look who you're working for.

[00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:01.660]
We've got a 5% pay increase, pay cut after a 3% increase. That sounds like minus to me.

[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:05.000]
Yeah. By the way, you'll be pleased to know since I'm not going to would mind it.

[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.520]
I'm going to sit down and write out all the checks.

[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:10.840]
All right. Writing one for chicken neck. By the way, it's going regular mail. Okay.

[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:15.140]
Putting my two stamps on it and it's going regular mail. I'm not spending 30 bucks to set out

[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:19.140]
a check. Oh, thanks in advance for overnighting. Screw you.

[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:27.000]
God, tongue. See, this is the thing that happens with me is that everybody I'm associated with

[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.860]
in any way, shape, or form. They have this feeling of entitlement entitlement. That's exactly the

[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:40.720]
word I was looking for. Very well done. You redeemed yourself for the eczema entitlement.

[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:48.720]
I mean, a fungal infection. Does it spread like beyond one place? Or do you have it just?

[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:51.340]
It will of course. Well, I don't have that. Especially the more I have it.

[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:56.160]
Scratch it. The more it's not spreading. Yeah. It's not a fungus.

[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.900]
Maybe I just had like that fleshy.

[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:05.160]
Greg says I saw promo for new reality types show airing on animal planet called jockeys.

[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.500]
Looked interesting. Well, I see.

[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:17.100]
That's it. George is okay, but he's no Adam Kirschner. He ha he regards Greg.

[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:23.140]
He ha he. I guess Greg got a real chuckle out of it. I didn't.

[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:27.640]
A laugh later. I'm saying the fake dog in somewhere says it's funny up here in Palm Beach.

[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:31.540]
You can hear the Cuban signal better than yours. The DJ sounds like Buffalo Bill.

[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.500]
The fake dog. That's it for this month about the Cuban signal in Palm Beach.

[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:43.660]
Aren't you impressed? No. I haven't got any information about what to do about my exima

[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:48.960]
or whatever. Or my finger rot. Maybe you should have it cut off.

[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:53.320]
Oh, Alice Ryan Tell. I forgot at the end of the show yesterday. I had one I am wounded by your

[00:53:53.320 --> 00:54:00.760]
hurtful comments said the fake Alice rantell. Olive Garden soup. I had the chicken and yaki soup

[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:05.220]
made with roasted chicken, traditional Italian dumplings and spinach. It was great. Well, I'm glad

[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:09.800]
that's a good place for you, Alice. You never were realist. I did anywhere. You're always a guido.

[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:17.660]
And here's this Tom Jicke thing again or other notable. This is that list.

[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.940]
Randy Rhodes had a near Rogers and talkers magazine rankings posted by Tom Jicke.

[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:28.580]
This is the same thing we had the other day. We already had this about what 100 times.

[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:34.120]
Yeah, I'm the fake or make believe Tom Jicke. I have no idea. I could cure less.

[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:41.120]
Talkers magazine. Oh, I'm wounded, man. And here's a graphic of extensive presentation and all

[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:45.320]
the names and all they are crap. I wonder how come Greg Budell's not on there.

[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:50.740]
And you want to know why? Why? Because they hate him. The whole world hates Greg Budell.

[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:55.960]
Like poison. Now you're looking. Your chops getting ready for the great lunch today from Kex South.

[00:54:56.200 --> 00:55:01.740]
I am so polishing as they say in our why? I just woke up really hungry today. I think you sound like

[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:11.040]
you're off to lock us. Oh. And I really have no idea why this spot is in this position. Why do I

[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:15.480]
have an idea? It's because we don't have a traffic department because everything at QM is

[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:22.560]
ass upside down automated. Automated. Pretty soon. Neal's going to be automated. Not as well be.

[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:27.560]
Well, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to have you record. Hopefully better quality than

[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:34.140]
that spot. Have you record like words? You know, hello. Goodbye. Hey, what's up? See you. Good.

[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:38.100]
I'll show you. Well, feed them into the computer. Your mom will play them randomly. Right. That's

[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:43.000]
right. Sounds from the old mouth. I'll make sounds with my mouth and get paid for it. I can be out of

[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.100]
wood by and plunging my guts. I'll losing my ass on the horrible new wheel of fortune. You people

[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:53.160]
are wood buying ought to be in prison for what you've done to us. The crap that they put in there,

[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:58.800]
imitation, airs, dots, wheel of fortune after all these years. And the reason being that, I guess

[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.740]
they were paying out too much money. They don't want you to win it. Why don't they just put a big

[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:05.240]
sign up there when you walk in there? We want you to lose your ass. We want your money. Just give

[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:15.800]
us the F and money. I thought maybe you fact me something, but it's a lead prospecting. Generate

[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:21.220]
new leads daily with outbound lead generating campaigns, just pennies per call. And here's a

[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:29.960]
Ontario number. Probably the number of Adam Oshmax house. Oh yeah, it's a year right. There's

[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:35.200]
like four people. It's the same Chuck from Chicago, Adam Oshmax. It's all the same misfits who have no

[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:40.800]
nothing else going on. This is their hobby. Keaton, come and know, nealatneararages.com. Everybody

[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:44.500]
except Chuck in Chicago. I will not read any more emails from you. You really bug me.

[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:49.460]
I can't stand people who are just way over the top like up here McGuire.

[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:55.680]
Nobody wants to hear you here. You have you had nothing. You have nothing to say.

[00:56:56.060 --> 00:57:00.680]
Papa, Papa, Papa, PPPP like that. Like Denise Pott van on acid.

[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:04.020]
Denise Pott van squared.

[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.120]
They get down like a tuna fish.

[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:58.220]
Taking up a big roll of his fat.

[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:03.420]
He'd only buy the smell because he tailed where it's at.

[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:06.120]
They're hanging.

[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:08.900]
They're hanging.

[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:13.120]
They're hanging.

[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.380]
The girls just find the little big fat guys.

[00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.100]
Chino out of eight to ball the fry.

[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:31.360]
Batman takes to the shower now.

[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:36.740]
We need to skip our gondola towel.

[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:43.680]
We need to go to bed and rest.

[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:45.320]
We need to go to bed.

[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.020]
We need to go to bed.

[00:58:54.120 --> 00:59:00.020]
Sorry for the mention that right at the end of the show yesterday, Alice Rantel,

[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.580]
I am wounded by your hurtful comments.

[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.400]
Well, good. That's what they're intended for.

[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.180]
Go away, get lost.

[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:09.240]
go get a hobby, go find a new boyfriend, do something.

[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.600]
Steve from Louisville says,

[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.420]
off-tulachis means spitefully, literally just to get somebody angry.

[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.100]
You want me?

[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:23.280]
Yeah, right here, but that's not what that other guy said.

[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:23.840]
I believe it.

[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.320]
I know. I'll get to his two.

[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:26.160]
Just just relax.

[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:29.380]
We got a four-hour freaking show here for crying out loud.

[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:31.120]
Read everything twice then.

[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:32.640]
Okay.

[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:36.860]
Steve Friedman says, off-tulachis means spitefully just to get somebody angry.

[00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:41.180]
But Steve in Dublin, California says,

[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.920]
from a dictionary of Yiddish, slangs and idioms,

[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:49.220]
off-tulachis in spite of everything you do, it still comes out wrong.

[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:55.680]
He says, a very kind old Jewish man long now dead gave me this book back in the

[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.520]
early 90s when you were debating the precise meaning of Zaguzunt.

[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:04.060]
Started listening on your first day on Zeta, now listening on the Internet from California.

[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:07.660]
Yes, the show has changed over the years, but it's still great to listen to when you're behind the mic.

[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:08.360]
Unbelievable.

[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.780]
So Steve, unbelievable.

[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.740]
A Guzunt, off-time cop says,

[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:20.240]
that I, a Guzunt, off-time cop means literally your head should be healthy.

[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:21.340]
Excellent.

[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:23.320]
Nothing like healthy head.

[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.700]
My skin is peeling.

[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:26.520]
Okay.

[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.700]
That's not thoroughly healing, that's just healing.

[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:30.120]
What?

[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.440]
Not necessarily a bad thing.

[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.180]
Why is it a good thing? Is it a good thing if your skin is peeling?

[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:36.400]
Well, it's fine.

[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:37.340]
How can that be a good thing?

[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:41.080]
Because you might have some fresh new skin under there and you're just getting rid of some of that.

[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.160]
And what about if I have nothing but old, smarmy skin out there, then you're off-tulachis.

[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.220]
When you get to be my age, you don't have fresh new anything.

[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:47.740]
Really?

[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:51.740]
No, you've got old, slimy, smarmy, mum.

[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.860]
Josh Corda says, probably the real one.

[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.520]
Neelie, you don't need to overnight my check.

[01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:58.660]
Regular male is fine.

[01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.860]
Hugs and snuggles, Josh.

[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:01.960]
I believe that's him.

[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:02.980]
Okay?

[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.560]
You don't?

[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:05.700]
Sounds okay.

[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.800]
You don't believe anybody.

[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.780]
It would be a first if you said yes, maybe.

[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:10.920]
No.

[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.680]
Guess who sent me another thing about eczema?

[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:16.060]
Well, that's because I asked, I guess.

[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:16.900]
I don't know.

[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.000]
Adam Oshmok.

[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.840]
Oh, maybe he's a dermatologist.

[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.840]
Maybe he's a lifeless idiot.

[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:27.040]
Maybe he's a lifeless fairy who sits around the house listening to the show on the internet all day, squeezing himself.

[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:31.320]
He says, go and get yourself some glyso-med hand cream.

[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:31.860]
Did you hear that?

[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:32.660]
No.

[01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:33.640]
Never heard of it.

[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.860]
It's the one in the green tube.

[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:36.640]
Oh, that one.

[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:37.500]
No, never heard of it.

[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.060]
Never heard of it.

[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.240]
It'll hear you right up.

[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:44.120]
You could go to a dermatologist, but this stuff they give you often as good as the stuff you can buy right today.

[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:45.240]
Shoppers drug mark.

[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:48.060]
Well, I'm going to go to shoppers drug mark as soon as the show is over.

[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.780]
As soon as I finish mailing those checks.

[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.920]
You know, there's checks that I'm not over nighting.

[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:55.260]
Yes.

[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.280]
Those are the ones.

[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.000]
Thanks for over nighting.

[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:00.980]
No, just relax.

[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:01.620]
Just sit there.

[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.260]
It makes more excitement in your life.

[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.440]
Wait for the email man to show up every day.

[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:06.480]
Oh, you got anything for me?

[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.140]
Anything for me, please.

[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.540]
Remember when Godfather 3?

[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:11.360]
Yeah.

[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:12.860]
And Joey Zaz, I was there.

[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:14.200]
There is nothing for you.

[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:15.740]
Nothing for you.

[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:15.820]

[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:17.160]
Oh, geez.

[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:26.060]
Brandon says, and the one thing about Brandon, he also is like all over the place here, but at least he always has something to say relevant to whatever we're talking about.

[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:26.340]
Right.

[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:31.660]
He has something to contribute as opposed to Chuck from Chicago who gives me spielkeys.

[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.660]
All I got to do is see another one of his emails and I want to just vomit.

[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:35.980]
Brandon's always relevant.

[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:38.480]
He's always got relatives.

[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:40.460]
Subject fingers.

[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:46.840]
About eight years ago, I had some of the very similar words who my fingers, the skin just dried up and got really nasty and gross.

[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.260]
I wouldn't say my skin is nasty and gross yet.

[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:53.120]
It was so bad my fingers were peeling and bleeding.

[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.280]
I went to the doctor and had to take a cream with steroids and to clear it up.

[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:57.660]
Wow.

[01:02:58.980 --> 01:02:59.860]
Anything for me?

[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:00.820]
No, nothing for you.

[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:05.320]
With you, I suggest keeping your hands well-loved with some good hand cream.

[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:09.280]
If it gets worse, you might have to have it checked out because it can spread fast like it did with mine.

[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.280]
It started out with two fingers, ended up with four always wrapped up in gauze.

[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.060]
Oh, wrapped up in gauze.

[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.820]
That sounds nauseating, isn't it?

[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:20.560]
Yeah.

[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.160]
Oh, the fake red butyl is back again.

[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:25.480]
Frank and Larry Mervis say hi.

[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.920]
I guess he always feels he's going to impress me with that.

[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:30.900]
Remember, Larry Mervis?

[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.900]
Don't get nervous call Larry Mervis, the insurance guy from a hundred years ago?

[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.760]
Talk about living in the distant past, fake red butyl.

[01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:41.500]
Tom Jek is already contacted me about the WQM Mermors get real to hate you more.

[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.860]
And nobody hates anybody more than they hate you Greg.

[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:45.980]
They despise you like poison.

[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.620]
I believe this is the real Greg Videl.

[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.460]
Greg Vengemin Videl, I believe it's him.

[01:03:52.860 --> 01:04:01.420]
He's enough of a nut in a can of a broadcast loser that he would be sitting around all day farting around on emails here.

[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.100]
And of course, always obsessed with yours truly.

[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.240]
Deal, guys.

[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.120]
Obsessed.

[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:11.640]
Don't you, doesn't that disturb you when people are like stalkers, you know?

[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:12.500]
Obsessed.

[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.000]
Oh, it's flattering.

[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:14.620]
And there's something.

[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:15.380]
What?

[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.420]
You don't want to have to have obsessed stalkers following you around.

[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:19.340]
Don't get into show business.

[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:22.700]
This is show business.

[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:23.900]
Show is.

[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.620]
Could have fooled me.

[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:29.940]
Gay Ted says, what is the point of George?

[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:32.760]
Oh, I'll print this one out, use it after all.

[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:32.980]
Great.

[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.380]
The George Bashing continues.

[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:41.400]
I would have thought with my anniversary coming up this weekend that they'd been more interested in that, but no, they're only interested in bashing you.

[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.960]
Steve Friedman has got a thing on here.

[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.420]
Why does he come back here again with this?

[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.020]
Where's this a different Steve?

[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.880]
We got more Jewish Steve's going on.

[01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:56.560]
Oh, here's the whole thing.

[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:58.580]
A Gonsum Aghila Yiddish.

[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.360]
Now, where the hell am I going to find off to Lafayst?

[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.820]
Is it under AUF?

[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:08.860]
Good luck.

[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:11.960]
No, I'll find it if it's on here and you know what?

[01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:12.380]
It's not.

[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:17.720]
As a year off mirror, I should have such good luck.

[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.320]
As a year off mirror.

[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.020]
Well, this is great, but I mean, I didn't want to hold you this language.

[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.040]
You just want to find out what off to Lafayst was.

[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:32.400]
Here's Brian who says, listening on the net, first day I went back when he runs data and we were in Florida on holidays.

[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.420]
Whatever happened to the bird, long life, Brian.

[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.460]
Well, he didn't have a long life. He's still dead.

[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:40.300]
Sorry, they are nothing but the pamphlets already.

[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:44.200]
When the hell was the base balls of the begin anyway?

[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:46.920]
Hi, I'm your Gibbon.

[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.100]
You may have wondered what kind of sausage is floating in the pink juice jar at the minimart.

[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:54.360]
Well, they're a byproduct of transgender reassignment surgery.

[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.580]
Quite tasty.

[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.240]
And good for you.

[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.800]
Ever seen nuts hanging on the back of the truck?

[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.240]
Like you don't know is.

[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:07.020]
Truck nuts are also a byproduct of transgender reassignment surgery.

[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.320]
I just show you what to do this.

[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:09.320]
Yes, Mommy.

[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.600]
Yeah, I want to look more like they're woman.

[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.920]
Okay, both still.

[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:14.920]
Here.

[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:20.400]
What do you want to do with these?

[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.840]
Just hanging on the back of the truck or something.

[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:26.940]
A door in your pickup truck with dangling manhood by dangling someone else's.

[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.760]
Available on brass, chrome, and blue anodized.

[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:33.740]
Make your truck use less gas by showing your ash with T-nuts.

[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.920]
Wow, I just got the entries.

[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:40.180]
Now, why did the Steve's slow in sending the entries for the first two races tomorrow?

[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:45.020]
You might want to beat him over the head with the meat cleaver and ash in that on the way by.

[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:47.640]
Both of them?

[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.720]
I mean, like the first and second?

[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:49.940]
Let me see it again.

[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:52.000]
The first and the second race.

[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:53.860]
Why do I need the racing form for the first race?

[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:54.820]
I just for practice.

[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:58.960]
Is this also the new thing that nobody has told me about is that we're going to like practice and.

[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:00.200]
Handy crap, the first race.

[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:00.700]
I beg your pardon?

[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:01.800]
Maybe it was a mistake.

[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:02.900]
No, it was not a mistake.

[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:07.280]
He said I'm including the crap for the first and the second race is tomorrow.

[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:08.540]
And here it is.

[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:14.900]
I have only one simple question about this.

[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:15.400]
Why?

[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:16.700]
That's all.

[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.120]
I mean, not that it's a big deal.

[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.720]
I mean, you know, it took three pages of.

[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.400]
And the second race, the one that we have to pick, I have to pick.

[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:28.840]
It's in 11 horse field, seven and a half for a long, $16,000 claiming.

[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:31.080]
Three year olds, which have never won two races.

[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:34.360]
Oh, my God.

[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:42.560]
But nevertheless, oh, Mr. Doctor Professor on the outside with the Kentis ormo.

[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:46.940]
Looking like a possibility, dropping back down where he belongs.

[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:51.700]
What do you think?

[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:52.680]
Sounds great.

[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:54.920]
Well, I'm not picking them now.

[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.400]
I haven't even hardly looked at this yet.

[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:57.940]
11 horses to pick from.

[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:02.480]
And on time, somebody sends me the first race also for some bizarre unknown reason.

[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:04.020]
I thought you said he was a good guy.

[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:04.800]
Steve?

[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:05.960]
Steve Sloan.

[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:06.540]
He is a good guy.

[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:06.960]
Great guy.

[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.680]
I think you're in cohorts.

[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:11.560]
That's right.

[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.520]
We're co-hooting right now.

[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:13.420]
I think it's all part of a plan.

[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.940]
We better get these emails cranking.

[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.540]
I'll tell you that.

[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.760]
Neil at NeilRogins.com.

[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:20.020]
Here's Greg Budell back again.

[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:22.760]
You've been hawking a chinaik about me for 30 years.

[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:23.880]
How can a chinaik?

[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:25.220]
Now he's doing Yiddish.

[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:28.820]
By the way, Rick Shaw still hates you for calling him a Nazi.

[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.460]
Yeah, that's why he came out and concerted with us a Gulf Stream that day.

[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:38.220]
That's why he took time out of his life to come hang with us and shmoo's around with us a Gulf Stream that day.

[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.420]
You still play that Bobby Daron talk up?

[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.260]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:42.860]
Bobby Daron.

[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.180]
I have no idea what you started about.

[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.080]
Get a life, Greg.

[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:46.520]
Go ahead and look with noodles.

[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.260]
Oh, this is good.

[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:51.220]
Here is some useful stuff from Christy.

[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:52.480]
Leave it to some lady.

[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:54.560]
How you doing with the ladies?

[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:55.580]
Who was Joe Rose again?

[01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:57.000]
How can I talk about with the ladies this morning?

[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:57.780]
Oh, God.

[01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:59.320]
He's just...

[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.660]
And then that storm cat.

[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:01.320]
Hey, storm.

[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:02.320]
What do you think, storm?

[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.460]
I mean, well, what is that show turning into?

[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:08.280]
Like a show for morons or what?

[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:16.320]
Steve says, I sent you the info for the first race because when you there, usually pick that race too.

[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:17.060]
Thanks, Neil.

[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:18.340]
You're the best at Steve's Sloan.

[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:18.780]
Oh, yeah.

[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:19.980]
Ho, ho, ho.

[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.060]
Wah, wah, wah.

[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:26.160]
Oh, I, oh, I hop is doing it.

[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.420]
Well, I don't care about I hop.

[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:27.840]
Okay.

[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.700]
We got a fine sponsor on there, the original pancake house.

[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.260]
I'm not getting seconded into it anymore.

[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:35.900]
Crap, preplug.

[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:36.260]
I hop.

[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.700]
I can't stand I hop in the first place.

[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.180]
Or they're one of our fine sponsors.

[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:43.760]
No, the original pancake house is, which we love.

[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:48.980]
And that's just because they're a sponsor because they got good food as opposed to I hop.

[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.040]
Here's one from Larry King.

[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.240]
What do you think of having a WIWD reunion show on Monday?

[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.760]
Scott Chape and can do a remake of the great WIWD song.

[01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:59.240]
I think it's a stupid ass idea, fake Larry King.

[01:09:59.560 --> 01:09:59.920]
Get a life.

[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.280]
Oh, now I'm getting all these things about skin rashes.

[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:04.020]
This is great.

[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:07.340]
This is good.

[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:11.280]
Oh, now here's one that says, this one can scare the crap out of you or help you.

[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.380]
The location appearance and color of a rash will, it's not a rash.

[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:22.940]
Look for Kara suggestions on this chart for common rashes and other skin conditions.

[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.860]
Says if you have like roughness between the fingers,

[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.240]
it means you've got like very, very.

[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.200]
Remember that movie all fall down?

[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:33.180]
You never did see it, did you?

[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:33.700]
Never did.

[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.300]
Oh, you'd like that.

[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.640]
Who's the even more insane I think is in there?

[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:44.360]
She's the one that very, very and branded to Will the head their eyes on.

[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:45.920]
I saw her first, very, very.

[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:50.320]
I saw her first, which is a real interesting way of looking at life, I guess.

[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:51.580]
I saw her first, therefore.

[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:57.480]
And of course, based on what we hear about Warren Beatty,

[01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:00.180]
I'll click on the above link for something, no thanks.

[01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:01.340]
Thanks Rudy, go away.

[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:03.620]
Click on the above link, no way.

[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.660]
Let me ask it for the eight million time.

[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:12.040]
What part of that don't they get?

[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.240]
The don't part.

[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:14.860]
Oh, don't do it.

[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:16.740]
Right, they hear it.

[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:17.000]
Do it.

[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.120]
Okay, let's see what we got.

[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.860]
Joe says about Italy.

[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.960]
After years of hearing you talk about your time in Italy,

[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:27.440]
I finally got my chance to go with my wife and I loved every minute of it.

[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:29.620]
The problem is that it was expensive as hell.

[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:32.300]
My wife likes to stay in high priced places and go shopping.

[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.640]
So what I would like for me if possible is a free plug for my company.

[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:36.460]
Oh, yeah.

[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.340]
So I can pay some of the bills this month.

[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:39.340]
Get out of here.

[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.320]
He went to Italy and cost him an army to lick in his wife's shop.

[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.260]
I'll tell you what, when you want to pay for what Paco bought in Italy last year,

[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.240]
last summer, then I'll, I will make a deal.

[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:52.440]
My God, he discovered everyone of those Hoochie, Coochie, Goochie,

[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:53.360]
everyone of those stores.

[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:54.680]
Johnny Versace.

[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:56.000]
What are the other ones?

[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.280]
You guys can be.

[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.020]
I'm asking a shluffer like you.

[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:01.160]
Well, whatever he found them all.

[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:02.600]
Spent a fortune.

[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:03.860]
Not a small fortune.

[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:04.620]
I'm not a big deal.

[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:04.900]

[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.160]
Christy says this is how you can tell if you have a skin rash or a fungus.

[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:12.320]
Pick some of the flaky skin off your head.

[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:14.560]
Under some colored paper.

[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:15.660]
Off my head.

[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.240]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.580]
I don't have flaky skin on my head.

[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.960]
I thought if you dig hard enough, maybe you will.

[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:27.620]
Well, let me, let me try it.

[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.280]
Try to squeeze it out.

[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.160]
No, I don't have.

[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:30.280]
I just shaved my head last night.

[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:31.780]
I showered and shampooed this morning.

[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.460]
I don't have any flaky skin on my head.

[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:36.320]
Try to get enough to make a small pile.

[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:37.920]
Then you have to smell it.

[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:38.860]
Oh my God.

[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:42.640]
If it doesn't have an odor, then it is exomer or something like that.

[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:43.960]
If it really stinks, then you have a fungus.

[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:44.960]
So let me smell my fingers.

[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:47.560]
Well, the probably smell like skin cream at this point.

[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.640]
Yeah, they smell like nutrogena.

[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:56.300]
If the smell is kind of like the group you scoop for under your nails, it's not too bad.

[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:57.980]
The odor is kind of putrid.

[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.660]
You may have the bacteria kind of may require an antibiotic treatment.

[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:02.140]
Hope this helps this Christy.

[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:03.780]
Yeah, it helps make me nauseous.

[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.080]
Just when George is about to get lunch.

[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:09.900]
Wouldn't you think I would know if my skin is stank?

[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:17.420]
My fingers are, I mean, one thing I may look like crap, but at least my hygiene is, you know, pretty bad.

[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.300]
Well, let me look at it.

[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:23.040]
I think that nutrogena is doing something.

[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.640]
I've had it for like two weeks.

[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:27.780]
It just doesn't go away.

[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:29.460]
And it's okay.

[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:30.040]
It's not a baby.

[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:32.360]
Except when it starts itching, that part on the little finger.

[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.460]
Oh, man.

[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.920]
Take a mosquito bite and multiply that sensation times about 50,000.

[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:43.020]
And you get an idea of what that, and then of course, being humans as we are, being weak, we scratch it.

[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:43.920]
Oh, you're rake it right.

[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.840]
Oh, and that makes it so much worse.

[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:49.200]
I mean, it feels so good to scratch it because I don't know why.

[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.420]
Why does it feel good to scratch it?

[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:51.460]
Because it itches.

[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:52.920]
And that relieves it temporarily.

[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:53.900]
No, does it?

[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.800]
And it also rips the skin right off your skin.

[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.540]
Rips the skin and causes it to spread and makes it worse.

[01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:58.640]
Oh, geez.

[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:00.100]
Well, it hasn't spread though.

[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.800]
I mean, they always tell you, if you get something in your eye, don't rub it.

[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:03.600]
Well, how can you not?

[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:06.560]
If you have something on your skin, rub it with the back here.

[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:07.060]
It's not all scratchy.

[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.100]
Yeah, easy to eat.

[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:08.760]
Easy to say.

[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:13.460]
Paul and the Cuses, I have a postular dermatitis that I get the base of my fingers occasionally.

[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.700]
Postular dermatitis, that sounds disgusting.

[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:16.460]
Oh, that sounds really good.

[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:18.820]
That's even worse than what Christy was saying there about smell it.

[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:22.880]
Diggin your head and then put a pile of it and make a pile of it and smell it.

[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:24.200]
Try not to inhale the flakes away.

[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:27.260]
How about digging in your rectum and making a pile of that and smell it?

[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:28.720]
How's that?

[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:31.620]
Talk about postular dermatitis.

[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:38.940]
The topical steroid, the other email I referred to, might be triamicinolone aceto.

[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.140]
I can't read it.

[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:43.140]
Aceto, aceto, an aceto, something.

[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:46.100]
You should get a prescription and keep it around in case of a breakout.

[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.360]
Charlie Simmer, Flames color is the Julie Berman of Hockey announcers.

[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.080]
Happy 33rd U-Turret, says Paul and the Cuse.

[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:57.200]
I never heard of a Charlie Simmer and that's because I don't watch the flames.

[01:14:59.140 --> 01:14:59.500]
FAMING!

[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:01.580]
Could care less about the Calgary Flames.

[01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:03.940]
Here's that thing from Ted.

[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.720]
What's the point of George?

[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:06.980]
But we better do the break first.

[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.960]
Break hate you.

[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:40.380]
You have nothing to get.

[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:41.520]
You have nothing to get.

[01:15:45.040 --> 01:16:00.620]
You have nothing to get.

[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:01.280]
You have nothing to get.

[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:03.300]
You have nothing to get.

[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:03.580]
You have nothing to get.

[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:03.880]
You have nothing to get.

[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:04.740]

[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:04.740]

[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:04.740]

[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:04.740]

[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:04.740]

[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:04.740]

[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:04.740]

[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:06.680]
You have nothing to get.

[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.120]
You have nothing to get.

[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.300]
You have nothing to get.

[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:11.860]
You have nothing to get.

[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:13.360]
You have nothing to get.

[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.260]
You have nothing to get.

[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.520]
You have nothing to get.

[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:23.300]
14 to the moon is 560 WQM, we got the big O.

[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:24.260]
Coming up at two o'clock.

[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.340]
People are lying up all the way to Homestead protesting.

[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:26.880]

[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:30.560]
I'm going to believe this guy's who George Corsag is brought through here.

[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:31.940]
Talk about a while.

[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:32.520]
Which was from the past.

[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:33.600]
No, but very close.

[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.340]
You speak of him before.

[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.300]
No, Paxton days.

[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:39.900]
Think Paxton.

[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:41.040]
Oh, no.

[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:41.500]
Yes.

[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.120]
No, no.

[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:43.420]
Yes.

[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:44.780]
Not that.

[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.000]
Not Roy Pressman.

[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:48.200]
Oh, somebody else.

[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:48.560]
Yes.

[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.780]
Somebody who you love to rip.

[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:51.060]
Love to quote.

[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:55.020]
Engineer.

[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:55.580]
Yes.

[01:16:58.220 --> 01:16:59.200]
I have no idea.

[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:00.420]
Max.

[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.000]
Oh, no.

[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:03.540]
Yes.

[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:04.540]
He loves to schmooze.

[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:05.140]
He loves to.

[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:05.760]
That's him.

[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:06.440]
That's the one.

[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:07.460]
Oh, no.

[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:09.900]
He wanted me to say hi.

[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.140]
I wanted to make sure that I would.

[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:12.820]
And so I did.

[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:15.380]
I like to schmooze.

[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.260]
I like to cruise.

[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:17.260]
I like to booze.

[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:20.120]
I don't like to do any work, but I sure like to screw around.

[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:20.980]
Yes.

[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.880]
What a great system if you can pull it off.

[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:23.560]
Yeah.

[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:24.460]
Well, we sure learned.

[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:25.520]
He shaved his mustache.

[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:28.000]
We learned the hard way when we started mailing it in the easy way.

[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:29.580]
I'm mailing it in a day.

[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.140]
I'll tell you that.

[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.860]
I'm taking it real slow.

[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:38.580]
In fact, from here till two, I'm doing one word at a time.

[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:39.360]
We're going to coast.

[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:41.560]
I'm going to coast on in.

[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.700]
By the way, it is the real Greg Budell.

[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.080]
I'm convinced myself of that.

[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:46.400]
He's just obsessed.

[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:47.780]
I'm obsessed.

[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:48.640]
I ate.

[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:52.220]
Now, I guess we could find out what time it's show on.

[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:55.720]
I'll go over there in Montgomery, Alabama, or wherever the hell he is in some podon town.

[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.000]
I guess he'll tell you.

[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:58.440]
Now, I'm sure he will.

[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.200]
Or I could Google it, you know.

[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.700]
If I could stand looking at that stupid that silly mustache again.

[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.040]
Maybe the Pope can come back there.

[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.100]
This is a different Pope now.

[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:09.440]
Maybe he can give the Pope his guided tour.

[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.060]
Remember when the previous Pope came to town?

[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.440]
And he was there to introduce him and to fondle his genitals.

[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:15.260]
Do all I get, sir?

[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:15.620]
Yes.

[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.320]
Even the Pope hated you too, Greg.

[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:19.180]
He told me.

[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:22.720]
Getting back to Randy Rhodes in the mystery of what happened with the goddess.

[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:24.400]
Where would?

[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.660]
And you people that send me the fake Tom jikestub, Tom and I have a code word.

[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:33.080]
And I know when it's the real Tom believe me in this one, ain't his.

[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:34.680]
But anyway, it's got nothing to do with this.

[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:36.240]
I Wikipedia this.

[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.420]
Randy Rhodes last show on Nova M.B.

[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:42.120]
Foreigner dropped break was February 3rd, 2009.

[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:47.260]
Political commentator on one time congressional candidate Nancy Skinner hosted the show in Rhodes

[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:51.040]
App since beginning February 5th, following this, I needed a drub knee of Nova M.

[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:55.960]
Radio posted a message on the Nova M site saying they were unable to disclose details

[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:59.020]
of what was going on due to Rhodes having complete control of the show.

[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:03.540]
And that Rhodes now has to make her decisions as to what she must do with her career.

[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:07.740]
Mrs. Dropney has also said, people are saying it's about money.

[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:08.980]
It's not about money at all.

[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.040]
I just could not fulfill one of her requirements.

[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:12.660]
Oh, I wonder which one that was.

[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.540]
Oh, woo.

[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:18.940]
So what's that idiot Max doing in there?

[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:20.660]
Visiting.

[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:23.980]
I asked if he was going to be coming to work here and other.

[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.360]
Oh, George laughed at me.

[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:28.200]
So you should have laughed at him.

[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.580]
If he did, however, note the financial impact of Rhodes departure.

[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.700]
I looked at our site and I could see that because Randy Rhodes is none there,

[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:39.360]
there are so many people leaving the founders club which involves a fee paid in Nova M.

[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:42.000]
And you can't operate without people's participation.

[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:46.540]
Additionally, Rhodes own website was taken down and replaced with a letter from Rhodes

[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:50.020]
to the supporter stating that the entire situation is within Nova M's control.

[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:53.260]
Any implication that Rhodes is responsible for the disruption is false

[01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:56.860]
and that Rhodes shall be seeking a new home in light of the recent developments.

[01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:59.360]
Well, she's got more problems staying in one place.

[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:00.880]
Doesn't she?

[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:02.040]
Seems to.

[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:03.260]
She don't even stay in.

[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:03.920]
Oh, what?

[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:09.460]
According to an individual familiar with the issue, Nova M agreed to provide certain standard legal protection

[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:10.680]
for the popular radio host.

[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:16.520]
But Rhodes had to leave the air in Nova M following the discovery that Nova had not lived up to its contractual promise.

[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:20.040]
Can you imagine a radio company living up to their contractual promise?

[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.100]
I can't even begin to believe that.

[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.520]
Subsequent to the February 19, 2009, Nova M radio and I say be filing for bankruptcy liquidation.

[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.380]
No such file has yet occurred at all.

[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.560]
That's not a good sign.

[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:34.940]
Wow.

[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:39.840]
XM said like radio air is compensated by on second thought, including Skinner,

[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.720]
who's broadcast live on American left channel.

[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:42.380]
Wow.

[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.800]
Nova M says they're going to be filing for bankruptcy.

[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.880]
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:49.480]
Then it's time to promising.

[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:50.780]
Does it?

[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:50.940]
Nope.

[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:53.040]
This is the business we have chosen.

[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:59.260]
Michael, I said to myself, this is the business we have chosen.

[01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:04.740]
I said, I wonder if Hyman Roth were still around.

[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.800]
Now, actually, in the end, they're he got shot and killed.

[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:08.000]
We never actually saw him die.

[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.860]
We saw the bodyguard.

[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.000]
We saw the assassin.

[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.400]
Rocco, wasn't that Rocco?

[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:15.680]
They went off to shoot Hyman Roth at the airport.

[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:16.100]
Right.

[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.040]
There's one thing that's certain, Tom.

[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:23.500]
You can kill anybody.

[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:26.600]
Right, Rocco?

[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:27.180]
Right.

[01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:32.000]
And there's its poor Tom Hagen.

[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:39.660]
First rated again at the blood, the bloodlust of his Sicilian brother,

[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:41.180]
Miguel.

[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.380]
Ted says, what's the point of George?

[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:49.620]
I've been training to get to this, but I want to scratch my head and scrape off a whole bunch of stuff and then smell it.

[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:53.060]
Oh, it smells like shampoo to me.

[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:54.800]
Well, it smells like good food in here now.

[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.640]
Well, you got your food now from Kex South, Greg.

[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:00.200]
I'm glad you mentioned that because it was spot come up in this next break.

[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.040]
They stood up again.

[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:03.660]
But at least we had one this hour.

[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:04.140]
That was good.

[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:06.420]
At least we had two today during the show.

[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:09.200]
Unlike one week, I think two weeks ago, what was last week?

[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:09.940]
I was on vacation.

[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:13.860]
Oh, let me this afternoon also be starting sending out those checks.

[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.100]
Let me also make up a vacation schedule for the rest of the year starting.

[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:18.400]
Oh, I think now sounds good.

[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:24.740]
Well, this is what Duff and everybody is begging about.

[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.160]
They would like to know, yes.

[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:27.360]
What do you mean they?

[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:28.160]
Duff.

[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.520]
I guess it's the Ciel's law and flee.

[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:30.120]
And that's right.

[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.680]
There's nobody else in that Ciel's department even knows we're on a year.

[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:33.420]
Maybe Barney.

[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.400]
Barney Miller.

[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:36.400]
Barney Miller.

[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:43.120]
Gay Ted says, what is the point of George?

[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:46.020]
He doesn't add anything knowledgeable or informative to the show.

[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:50.420]
I don't understand what the point of having him on the show is because he needs to make a living Ted.

[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:52.500]
That's what he's on the show for just like me.

[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:53.620]
Moshe 11.

[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.440]
Off to Laxas.

[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.700]
It seems that he's a very angry person who dislikes everything except what he thinks is good.

[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:01.120]
Well, that's all of us are like that.

[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:03.420]
Don't we dislike everything that we like?

[01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:06.160]
I even just like some of the stuff that I do like.

[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:06.480]
How's that?

[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:06.700]
Right.

[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:12.400]
I believe it's because he feels that he's wasting his life making a horrible salary while having to work for Joe Bell.

[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.940]
Well, I think you got a gay Ted having to work for Joe Bell is a very worse than death.

[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.380]
It's worse than being in hell working for Joe Bell.

[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.380]
The Celi appearances at computer stores and racetracks don't help either.

[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:25.080]
His home life is miserable as well.

[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:26.340]
Well, that we know.

[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:31.140]
George, I'm sure that your wife and daughters appreciate your hard working constant pot smoking.

[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:32.780]
You're a real role model for them.

[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:36.820]
Why don't you just move up to the mountains of North Carolina or Montana and do everyone a favor?

[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:37.360]
Thanks.

[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:37.840]
Ted.

[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:39.900]
Thanks.

[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:41.920]
Well, guess what?

[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:42.700]
Screw you, Ted.

[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:44.580]
George ain't going anywhere until we're good and ready.

[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:46.400]
Good and plenty.

[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:47.300]
You're eating good and plenty.

[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:47.940]
I'm sure you have.

[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:48.680]
Oh, yeah. Love it.

[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:49.180]
That's horrible.

[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:50.320]
I love it. It's licorice.

[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:50.860]
You don't like licorice.

[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:51.780]
I don't know.

[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.500]
I don't mind licorice, but I don't like good and plenty.

[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.080]
I don't like the candy on the outside.

[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.260]
I like it all in pink.

[01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:59.000]
You have purple and pink.

[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.580]
It sounds really gay.

[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:01.560]
Yeah, like that.

[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:04.980]
I'm not hitting the right buttons because I've got this mountain of discs sitting here.

[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:06.240]
Discs.

[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:06.900]
Is that what you're talking about?

[01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:07.340]
Discs.

[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:07.720]
Okay.

[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:12.560]
Hascom disc, ACN disc, BB discs.

[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:16.260]
So Greg VDell is back again, which I'm going to block him pretty soon.

[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.260]
He's getting really, really tired of him.

[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:19.020]
He's another one.

[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.980]
He wants to do just a whole rap between it.

[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:22.200]
You know, why don't you give him my phone number?

[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.200]
And you can call up when Chad will be all afternoon.

[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:29.080]
Not by the way, the real way to block some of those people is send forward that email to Eric

[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.840]
and say, block that guy and it blocks them.

[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:31.800]
I don't need to do that.

[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:33.480]
I just block him on my regular thing.

[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:37.320]
And unless I want to check the deleted ones, which I don't, I mean, I see that they're there,

[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:41.000]
which I find somewhat amusing or pathetic, but I don't read them.

[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:45.140]
I got several people following that category and he'll be the next one.

[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.700]
Rick Shaw talking up Dream Lover by Bobby Dehran.

[01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:51.540]
He used to place this all the time when Ricky and I were at Waxi.

[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:52.280]
He hated it.

[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:53.660]
Wow.

[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:58.140]
This is the kind of stuff that sticks into my, this is the kind of groupie that we got.

[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.040]
Obsessive behavior.

[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:02.500]
Obnoxious and obsessive.

[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:04.720]
No wonder the world hated you like Poison Greg VDell.

[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.840]
In addition to which nobody knows who the hell you are.

[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:14.960]
Here's one from Paul who just moved down and I'm going to use this after the break after we sell our certificates and do our thing.

[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:15.460]
All right.

[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:19.020]
Just moved down to Fort Lauderdale from Michigan to do the job.

[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:21.860]
Found the show and love it.

[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.000]
Also, thanks George is great.

[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:23.680]
Wow.

[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:25.420]
And thinks he did a great job when he filled in for you.

[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.820]
But then he goes on about who are some of these people.

[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:30.040]
He hears us talking about like who the hell is Greg VDell?

[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:32.140]
Yeah, even people who didn't just moved down from Michigan.

[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:37.760]
Even if people are living in South Florida, all their lives are wondering who the hell is Greg VDell and who the hell could care.

[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:39.580]
This is Mark Morgan.

[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:42.720]
It's the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M.

[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.840]
It's a good time for the great taste.

[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:52.860]
Neil, this is Noodles reminding you that it's always a good time for the great taste.

[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:58.620]
John Farn, the taxi driver, the driver, the driver, the driver.

[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:02.080]
You looked at me so quesically.

[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:04.060]
I could tell he was in a dock.

[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:10.840]
So I acted out my puncture in with my arms the trees I made.

[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:13.560]
No buzz speaks English and in more.

[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:21.740]
I went down to my young man bridge where the weather was nice and sunny.

[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:27.080]
I walked into a liquor store but the guy there talks real funny.

[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:31.680]
I asked him for a pint of whole gym beamies as no one to end up.

[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:32.740]
What does that mean?

[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:36.300]
The butter speaks English and in more.

[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:39.560]
I'm not the cornered derby.

[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:43.760]
Hell, I think I'm in Pakistan speaking English.

[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:47.600]
Millie, you can go back to the LR.

[01:26:55.100 --> 01:27:01.080]
I came here many years ago to learn my ABCs.

[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:04.300]
I don't say much is grossiest.

[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.020]
I say pretty much.

[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:10.420]
So get yourself to a classroom quicker in America now.

[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:11.700]
Stop making mistakes.

[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:14.020]
You know, but I speak English.

[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.100]
Yeah, I couldn't have said a bit of myself.

[01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:21.340]
12.01 at 5.60 WQAM.

[01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:22.500]
We only got two hours to go.

[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:23.240]
Less a minute, George.

[01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:24.400]
Woo!

[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:27.600]
We're mailing it on a Thursday and boy Monday marks.

[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:31.260]
I'm just warning everybody not to be talking with my mouth full for a while.

[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:32.660]
Oh, so what do you got?

[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:34.620]
Oh, I forgot all about checking the thing out.

[01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:34.840]
What?

[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:35.860]
I got everything.

[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000]
I got some steak tips.

[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.100]
I got some two kinds of wings.

[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:42.140]
I got a steak wrap, two to steak wrap.

[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.520]
And what's this crazy steak you're making me eat over here?

[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.540]
22 ounce bone in rib eye.

[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:49.120]
22 ounce bone in rib eye that I carved a chunk up.

[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:49.680]
All right.

[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:55.460]
And I got a studio full of all these really hot, beautiful women and Josh Cornus.

[01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:58.620]
Oh, Josh ain't in there for the women.

[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:01.120]
He's walking down the hall and he just followed them and he just did it.

[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:02.180]
Didn't know where they were going.

[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:02.940]
The eight-four-sur-difficants left.

[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:05.560]
We started with a hundred for Keg South of Kendall.

[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:06.700]
We got 84.

[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:07.940]
I'll check that out while you're eating.

[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:08.400]
All right.

[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.280]
And we still have 84 by the...

[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:13.780]
What the hell is that all about?

[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:14.700]
Why is there still 84?

[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:15.580]
I don't know.

[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.240]
Well, I'll keep checking on it for you.

[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:19.800]
And it'll be here.

[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:20.960]
Give me something to do while you're eating.

[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.420]
So what those Josh Cornus doing?

[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:24.640]
And they'll be said to eating the free food.

[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:25.100]
That's it.

[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:25.780]
Eating the free food.

[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:27.940]
You know, now that you're not going to be sending them those checks anymore,

[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:28.940]
he needs to make the most of these up for Josh Cornus.

[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:30.860]
Oh, I guess this meal is in lieu of that last check.

[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:31.780]
Isn't that the way this works?

[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:33.260]
It's going to be like his last meal.

[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:35.780]
In lieu of the last check.

[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:36.720]
Right.

[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.100]
Right, Josh?

[01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:40.340]
Yeah.

[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:41.340]
Yeah.

[01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:42.120]
Okay, good.

[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:44.620]
Okay, like I said, I only got one check to make out.

[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:51.800]
Michael says George is an excellent fill in host and I would definitely enjoy a Georgian flea show from 2 to 4.

[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:57.660]
He too has introduced me to some cool things including the old billabong pub and the wacky weed.

[01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:03.000]
So continue to success to Georgian have a great time with my pal Lisa at MS Walk this Sunday.

[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:03.800]
Thank you.

[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:09.920]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:12.220]
I met what part of the MS Walk this Sunday?

[01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:13.120]
Yeah, the MS.

[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:15.420]
MS stands for a multiple sclerosis.

[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:16.880]
Right.

[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.200]
And I'm going on a charity.

[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:18.960]
I'm going to know that.

[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:22.460]
I'm helping to raise money for MS because Lisa asked me to and I said yes.

[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:23.860]
Well, good for you.

[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:27.220]
See that George, he's got a hard a gold man.

[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:28.740]
Just ask me.

[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:32.660]
Got an old hard a gold like Neil Young and Neil.

[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:33.360]
Neil.

[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:34.440]
What's his name?

[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.820]
An old hard a gold but nevertheless.

[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.260]
Still 84 certificates here on Keks out the candle.

[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:42.380]
I think that must be a mistake.

[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:48.060]
We got 120 150's for 25 bucks and they're still 84 left.

[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:49.600]
They've been there 20 years.

[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:52.180]
So it's not this new restaurant excuse me.

[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:52.420]
No.

[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:56.880]
And you got your food and your booze and I mean, well, what's not to like?

[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:57.480]
No, though.

[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:04.240]
And George is just when I went to meet in the steak now, the steak tuna, tuna steak wrap right now.

[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.680]
But I got two kinds of steak on my plate.

[01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:09.560]
I'm actually literally eating with both hands.

[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:10.320]
I have food in each hand.

[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:13.460]
You got food in your what?

[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:14.080]
Brackdom.

[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:14.640]
Wow.

[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:14.760]
I don't know.

[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:18.040]
Anyway, still 84 left on there.

[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:19.320]
So I'll check on periodically.

[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:23.120]
But evidently, these aren't the ones that are going to go like like what grease lightning.

[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:26.620]
Don't ask me why I don't know.

[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:27.940]
Michael says.

[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:33.440]
Oh, this is the same Michael that just see this is what these people do.

[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.520]
Not that not that this is a problem.

[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:37.280]
You know, a couple of emails is fine.

[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:39.080]
But he sent the one before.

[01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:41.020]
It's just I don't know.

[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.800]
I think reading the comics was a better idea.

[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:46.760]
I think that that's better than these emails.

[01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:50.480]
Remember we're talking about that the other day we read the comic books read the phone book.

[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:51.660]
Read the funny pages like.

[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.420]
L Martino.

[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:55.180]
Read not so funny pages would be better.

[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:56.580]
Like these.

[01:30:58.700 --> 01:30:59.320]
Michael says.

[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:02.560]
The purpose of this notice to thank you for two of the best purchases I've ever made.

[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.800]
One, dream fields pasta, a great tasting pasta line with a fraction of the carbs.

[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:11.400]
This pasta is full flavored goodness that doesn't make me feel guilty or bloated with every generous serving.

[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.240]
Well, don't you love the way he wrote that he could write copy for us.

[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:14.520]
Yep.

[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:18.800]
If we had somebody who wrote copy, which we don't.

[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.880]
Two, the new wave oven.

[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:22.120]
I thought it was called the flavor wave.

[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:23.500]
Well, I think they changed the name of it.

[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:25.400]
We use it twice three times a week.

[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:26.080]
Me too.

[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:31.020]
This is the best piece of culinary equipment to come about since the invention of the microwave if not better.

[01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:36.460]
Neil since acquiring this product in October, my family has used this at least four times a week.

[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:40.100]
We've cooked succulent filet mignon's fall off the bone pork ribs.

[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:45.880]
Different varieties of fish, whole chickens, even our first Thanksgiving turkey, which produced the juiciest white meat ever.

[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:46.560]
Bacon.

[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:47.720]
Oh, it's nothing like that.

[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:48.480]
Juicy white meat.

[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.060]
Have I ever eaten?

[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:51.200]
Nothing makes bacon like the flavor waiver of.

[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.100]
So thank you, sir, for the great years of great entertaining radio.

[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:58.320]
Please keep your product reviews coming because your fans are listening.

[01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:58.920]
This is Michael.

[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:09.340]
My fans aren't exactly jumping on those certificates today for whatever reason, but then again, you encountered similar difficulties last week, didn't it?

[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:11.120]
Also for no good reason.

[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:12.800]
Yeah, we still got 84.

[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:15.880]
We still have 84 out of 100 left.

[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.000]
Maybe there's an issue.

[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:18.860]
Maybe with their stuff or something.

[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:20.280]
Maybe there's an issue.

[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:23.280]
Wouldn't be the first thought.

[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:27.800]
But this is a very, very good email.

[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:31.160]
Maybe the best one in the history of the subhuman race.

[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:32.380]
You want to hear it?

[01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:33.640]
Please, I'm begging you.

[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:38.200]
Ever notice how every station Greg Vidal has been on is now dead?

[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:41.600]
Love 94.

[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.380]
The Sable era WYOD.

[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:46.160]
WJNA.

[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:49.420]
He leaves the trail of catastrophe and used needles in his wake.

[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:50.200]
Always like.

[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:50.700]
He's like, oh my god.

[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:55.360]
Quit worrying about others, careers and take care of your back problems, Greg.

[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:59.880]
You'll soon be sipping cheap beers with Johnny Dark on the beach sent by anonymous.

[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:02.420]
How do you like that?

[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:05.480]
Wow.

[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:09.800]
Hey, Neil, there's great burgers right by Georgia's house off Hollywood Park in a one a Lee tub.

[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:11.560]
Says, much, Linda.

[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.920]
Well, we're doing kegs out today.

[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:13.940]
Okay, so quit trying to get.

[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:15.580]
Oh, here you go, Johnny Dark.

[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:17.140]
Why do you keep this sparaging glen?

[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:19.960]
He added a lot to your show and was a lot better on the other than George.

[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:21.740]
Greg is a nice guy and a good talent.

[01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:23.020]
Why do you dislike him?

[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:23.640]
You hate everyone.

[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.340]
Happy anniversary, you malcontent.

[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:26.580]
That's the real Johnny Dark.

[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:27.700]
Thanks, Johnny.

[01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:28.360]
Up yours.

[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:30.520]
We have kind of a love hate relationship.

[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:31.460]
I love he hates.

[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:32.640]
Where is it the other way around?

[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:36.100]
Oh, take her park is back in.

[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:36.880]
Remember her from yesterday?

[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:38.780]
Take her park as intake her crap.

[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:40.940]
How's the food, by the way?

[01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:41.460]
Great.

[01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:43.620]
And what do you got beside the steak?

[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:44.320]
What else do you want?

[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:45.920]
What are kutron's are you got?

[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:48.080]
I just take a steak tips and some wings and I go.

[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.020]
Oh, you got those steak tips.

[01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:49.540]
Yes.

[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:51.200]
Hmm.

[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:52.540]
Sounds delish.

[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.440]
And what am I doing for them?

[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:55.120]
I take bites, they're called.

[01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:55.420]
What?

[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:57.000]
What am I doing for them?

[01:33:57.060 --> 01:33:57.380]
Nothing.

[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.620]
I'm sure you'll eat something bad later.

[01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:01.740]
No, I'm sure.

[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:02.380]
I better not.

[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:04.000]
I think this is diabetes related.

[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:04.840]
Do you think that could be?

[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:07.180]
I know skin problems are sometimes diabetes related.

[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:07.840]
What?

[01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:08.760]
Let's pretend that it is.

[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.180]
Maybe the circulation in my hand is going.

[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:11.080]
Do you think that's possible?

[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:11.960]
Maybe.

[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:14.920]
Oh, this is the hand I tapped the machine with.

[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:16.920]
Yeah, I tapped it.

[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:20.520]
Chaching, chaching.

[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.520]
What they did to Wheel of Fortune and to go out of wood by.

[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:24.880]
There's going to be a revolutionary.

[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.020]
You'll see, I'm going to lead the way.

[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:27.560]
They've taken away.

[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:28.180]
I lawsuit.

[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.360]
Anyway, takeer whose real name is Sarah.

[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:36.680]
So, I'm sorry for sending you that stupid email yesterday regarding LA radio.

[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:37.480]
I'll try and do it again.

[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:39.520]
Yeah, nobody here cares about LA radio.

[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:41.420]
Sarah, takeer or whatever your name is.

[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:44.640]
Have you ever heard of a horse by the name of Lady Kate?

[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.780]
No, who used to race at the 40-re track?

[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:47.120]
No.

[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:51.520]
It was the first horse I ever been on and one enough to pay the toll back into the US.

[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:52.820]
Have a nice day.

[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:54.120]
Takeer, my real name is Sarah.

[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:56.180]
Wasn't that in a tremendous story?

[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.240]
There's such a mean man.

[01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:01.780]
That's why I'm here.

[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:02.480]
You hate everybody.

[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:04.240]
Dix is.

[01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:05.440]
I've been listening to you for many years.

[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:09.020]
Way back when Steve came for tended to be, he was interesting.

[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.440]
And Typhon McCallum put the world of sleep.

[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:12.600]
Neil, you were and still are the best thing on a radio.

[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:15.540]
And thank God I can still listen to you via your live stream.

[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:18.160]
I got to hell out of South Florida a few years ago.

[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:21.080]
A few years too late, but at least that's the sort of a city is behind me.

[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:28.580]
Put a microphone in your casket when you go and you'll still have better ratings than the rest of those clud, duds, and Joyce can milk you for eternity.

[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:30.320]
Keep it up and have fun, says Dick.

[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:31.160]
Thanks, Dick.

[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:32.800]
And you like that?

[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:33.760]
Dick says, keep it up.

[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:34.400]
Very nice.

[01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:34.780]
Do it.

[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:35.220]
Keep it up.

[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:39.540]
Larry says, Dernie, I heard this Liberace sound like.

[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:41.760]
State the only thing that you weren't head to head.

[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:43.180]
Oh, that is what is it?

[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:46.360]
The only time you went head to head with Steve Cainy beat you in the ratings.

[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:47.660]
Oh, yeah, right.

[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:49.340]
He never beat anybody in the ratings.

[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:49.880]
No.

[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.420]
Is this possible?

[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:55.680]
He also claimed that you offered to hire him many years ago and would then double his salary.

[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.920]
But he wanted to remain loyal to Cain.

[01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:58.560]
Is this possible?

[01:35:58.840 --> 01:35:59.060]
No.

[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:04.040]
Maybe I wanted to hire Brian for some personal services, but I sure as hell didn't want to hire him to put him on a year.

[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:07.300]
I'm going to sneeze.

[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:10.420]
That's my Brian Craig allergy.

[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:17.120]
He continually claims that he is a proud conservative Republican husband, father, and family man.

[01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:19.300]
He also can do, what do I care about him?

[01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:23.780]
Goes on and on and on about this and that.

[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.080]
Oh, we don't care about Brian Craig.

[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:28.020]
Like you say about the Mr. Eagle crowd.

[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:28.680]
Right.

[01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:29.540]
We don't care about that.

[01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:32.080]
Oh, here's one that says why don't you take some calls.

[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.640]
I have one response to that.

[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:33.960]
No.

[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:34.300]
Short.

[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:34.600]
No.

[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:34.880]
Quick.

[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:35.220]
No.

[01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:35.880]
To the point.

[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:36.120]
No.

[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:36.640]
No chance.

[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:38.400]
You got it.

[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:45.800]
For the record have you ever used steroids, human growth hormone or any other performance enhancing substance?

[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:46.520]
No.

[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:54.120]
When I'm asked by the press, hey, Erad, why are you a heating slop like Barry Bons?

[01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:59.480]
I just poorly respond that I was young and young.

[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:05.380]
I was young and stupid and dumb.

[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:13.620]
The rights for agents and obliassists can make a millionaire out of a dumb ass kid.

[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:18.860]
All you got to do is treat if you're young and dumb.

[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:25.280]
Young and stupid and dumb and dumb.

[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:34.580]
I was young and dumb but what's more important is that I can't let the gun find out I'm hung like a nut.

[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:38.340]
You know, I was young and dumb.

[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.200]
Young and dumb.

[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:52.320]
All you boys and girls who want to be playing one day in the major leagues just lie a lot and cheat.

[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.080]
I was young.

[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.220]
I was stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.

[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:57.700]
Young and dumb and full of fun.

[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.420]
1216 at 560 WQM.

[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:03.380]
So guess who's egging me on to take calls here?

[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:04.220]
Your friend Zisco.

[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:05.200]
Okay.

[01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:08.040]
He's annoying.

[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:08.900]
Okay.

[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:10.080]
He is.

[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:10.540]
Okay.

[01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:11.700]
He's not annoying you're chucking Chicago.

[01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:13.400]
Who even after I ripped him and asked?

[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:13.820]
Yeah.

[01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:16.700]
He still sent me some of the thing about Opholonthus and I just deleted it.

[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:17.500]
Okay.

[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:19.840]
What part of, boy, you're still eating?

[01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:20.400]
Oh, yeah.

[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:21.800]
Oh, not eating too certificates.

[01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:23.380]
By the way, we still got a lot to go.

[01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:24.520]
Long way to go.

[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:25.740]
Yeah, they're like Jewish mothers over here.

[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:26.660]
They just keep giving me food.

[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:27.320]
Good.

[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:29.460]
Well, we still got 82 to go out of the hundred.

[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:30.060]
That's 80.

[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:32.560]
Like I said, they're going in chunks.

[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:35.620]
In time.

[01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:37.360]
Like Linda Blair would say in time.

[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:37.900]
Remember that?

[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:38.320]
Yep.

[01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:40.180]
Do that again.

[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:41.200]
In time.

[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:42.100]
The.

[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:45.460]
That was a 52 points.

[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:46.200]
Let's hear about it.

[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:47.020]
Wow.

[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:49.380]
Sounds like a real good selling opportunity to me.

[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:50.820]
I wonder how Maria B's doing today.

[01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:51.860]
I wonder how Maria B.

[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:56.660]
Anyways, this goes says taking calls was just a suggestion.

[01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:59.280]
See any of you done it under a different name a minute ago?

[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:03.020]
I think who put it and I would come back as this go.

[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:05.880]
George, that's why you were gone and it was great.

[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:08.220]
Was it was it great to cause?

[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:09.580]
I was told me.

[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:11.980]
It's a spectacular that I'm still vibrating from it.

[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:13.420]
It'll help kill time.

[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:14.300]
You won't have to work this hard.

[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:15.760]
I don't mind working this hard.

[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:16.080]
Okay.

[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:17.460]
I got a pile of crap here.

[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:17.800]
Okay.

[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:19.640]
I got a pile of stuff.

[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:24.220]
I got my anniversary show coming up on Monday and you take that after 33 years of working

[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:27.520]
over a hot frickin' microphone that I wouldn't have to sit in and beg for emails.

[01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:31.140]
It says the cranks are gone with simple push of a button.

[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:33.320]
I say go for it either way the show is a great take here.

[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:37.320]
This go screw you is this go you phony you faker.

[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:41.020]
The cranks are going he's giving me instruction how to do the show now.

[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:42.680]
The cranks are gone with a simple push of the button.

[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:45.340]
Like this is my first day on a job.

[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:48.460]
I think you got him on your side now.

[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:49.180]
He's one of your people.

[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:49.520]
Oh yeah.

[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:50.880]
Oh yeah that's right.

[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:52.480]
It's that my space craft.

[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:53.100]
That's it.

[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:57.980]
They all abandoned me except the professor and Brandon everybody also abandoned me like I had

[01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:00.300]
like I had a rash in my finger or something.

[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:02.580]
You know what I mean?

[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:03.100]
What do you mean?

[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:08.420]
I don't want to make any rash judgments but that's what it sounds like to me like this go jump over to your crowd.

[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:13.760]
How's that pull coming?

[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:15.120]
You like it?

[01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:17.240]
Maybe I do.

[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:20.140]
Oh well we got the new one on there we could change it.

[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:22.760]
I don't want to change it maybe we got a shot of a thousand votes I don't think so.

[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:24.000]
Shot at 900 though.

[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:25.360]
We got another shot at love.

[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:27.620]
We got another shot at love.

[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:27.800]

[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:31.020]
What minor injury is the most painful?

[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:36.740]
858 votes of which 455 53% say getting punched in the balls.

[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:39.880]
Punch in the balls baby.

[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:48.520]
Punched in the nuts.

[01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:49.620]
Are you still eating?

[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:50.720]
Yeah I'm eating.

[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:52.980]
Jesus God what a pig.

[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:54.140]
Jesus Christ.

[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:57.980]
Punched in the balls 455 paper cut 160 and that got my vote.

[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:03.800]
I mean we've all gotten like you know walked into a door or into like the side of a chair.

[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:10.080]
I wouldn't call that getting punched in the balls but like getting racked in the nuts.

[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.180]
Racked in the nuts.

[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:11.980]
Oh no.

[01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:14.060]
Everybody ought to have a good nut rack.

[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:17.680]
At least once.

[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:18.760]
Oh yeah.

[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:19.740]
No I don't mean that.

[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:21.020]
I'm not rack where you put your nuts on.

[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:21.420]
Oh really?

[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:23.200]
Paper cut 160.

[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:26.980]
See if there was a god there wouldn't be such a thing as a paper cut.

[01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:31.340]
Your fingers would be stronger than that or whatever the other piece of skin.

[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:33.000]
How is my fingers looking by the way?

[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.140]
A lot better since I smeared on that new Trajina.

[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.980]
Although still a little red roughened sore.

[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:43.360]
Is he still across the hall or what or they bring him back what did you tell me about him?

[01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:45.300]
Pedal in everywhere.

[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.600]
All right he's like a disease maybe that's what I got between my fingers is PD Lennyson right.

[01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:52.520]
You open the hood of your car there's PD Lenny.

[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:53.980]
Oh God what a thought.

[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:56.420]
The bathroom stall PD Lenny.

[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:07.680]
Stubbed to 93 poked in the eye 59 ice cream had a 46 banged elbow 40 kicked in the shin 27 bumping your head on something 20 cut by shaving 2.

[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:12.260]
So all you ladies out there will never have the joy of knowing what it feels like to get punched in the balls.

[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:21.200]
Now what about getting punched in the crotch if you ain't got no ball it still doesn't feel good but it's not it's no comparison.

[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:23.980]
No no no because those are really tender nuts.

[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:25.180]
Yes.

[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:29.800]
Oh and somebody really riffs you and asks about that candy I agree with him.

[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:30.480]
The candy?

[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:33.340]
Yeah but those I'll get to it.

[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:36.060]
I'm trying to get back on my cage.

[01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:36.720]
Oh whatever.

[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:37.680]
Good and plenty yeah.

[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:40.800]
Nor 78 they're going in pairs.

[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:41.960]
Couple here couple there.

[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:46.080]
We'll get there we'll get there we'll get you know what we'll get where we get.

[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:49.660]
Oh this goes back again you don't have to be crabby old man.

[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:50.940]
Baaah baaah.

[01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:53.780]
No I don't want to be crabby just quit tell me how to do the show that's all.

[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:57.900]
Do we have any problems with the show today I don't have any problem with it at all.

[01:42:58.500 --> 01:42:59.360]
I'm having a good time.

[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:01.520]
I'm having a great lunch.

[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:06.500]
I sound fine you're having a good lunch the emails are coming in I mean they are what they are

[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:10.620]
even though you don't want to do the emails anymore you you're the one that put this in their head while I was on vacation.

[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:12.580]
Yeah that's right positive.

[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:19.780]
You are the one do whatever you want that you know what that's what exactly what I'm doing that's why they called in the

[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:24.620]
a Roger show that's what they call me never told you what to do and also call me you fair that too.

[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:26.600]
And I don't we don't care about either one.

[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:31.280]
Just here Mast 11 is they say in China just here making a living.

[01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:34.920]
I'm retired invested living on a pension.

[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:40.040]
I guess he's not living on a pension anymore.

[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:46.520]
They kind of cleaned that scene up real quick now that I think about it and Godfather too they're at the end of that.

[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:47.640]
Don't you remember?

[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:55.620]
They were escorting him to the airport in Miami no less in Miami and there was Rocco waiting to blow a highman

[01:43:55.620 --> 01:44:00.740]
Roth away and he did and then of course they all blew him away which what what do you think he was going to make a

[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:02.680]
getaway or something I don't know suicide.

[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:07.440]
I mean one thing about all those guys who were pretty stupid I mean just like that bodyguard with a black outfit and

[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:12.780]
and have a van yeah with a little trying to smother him and Roth put the pillow over it didn't work with that pillow.

[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:19.040]
If you're going to use protection against gunfire pillows usually a pretty bad idea unless it's got like an

[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:22.000]
astray in it or something like that yeah maybe thought it was a bulletproof pillow.

[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:27.680]
I always a good idea to go down to your nearest zirr store and pick up a couple of bulletproof pillows.

[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:30.900]
Maybe we can get some spots for that pretty soon.

[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:33.480]
I'm that new dime it doesn't deal we got going.

[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:36.860]
Penny a holler.

[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:40.840]
Sure Justin says promos for your show late night on QAM.

[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:43.080]
I'm telling you that flea he's the only hope we got.

[01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:47.000]
The great little Jewish hope is flea.

[01:44:47.780 --> 01:45:00.460]

[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:10.420]
Says Justin that's right it's the best radio that money can't buy how do you like that Alice Rantell is back in and you know something I'm positive it's the real Greg Videl in the real Alice Rantell.

[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:11.700]
I'm sure of it.

[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:24.600]
Okay, even though you're a skeptic yep tell Sarah her and I are the only two left see it's not even literate her and I not she and I her and I are the only two left illiterate Alice see it the palace Alice.

[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:32.160]
78 still.

[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:48.680]
Well the fake Larry King is back any plans for Monday show why don't you fly in over the weekend to do Monday show from QM with a live studio audience no I'm not flying in I'm not doing live studio audience I'm not having Scott Chape and I'm not doing anything you suggest fake Larry King.

[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:54.540]
Like I said piano wire.

[01:45:55.060 --> 01:46:01.540]
Yeah that would be the perfect way to finish off some of these cry here gasoline and fire I like that idea.

[01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:05.820]
Rands me to see in the birds.

[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:06.920]
Uh huh.

[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:13.180]
That's one of the all time great fire scenes you know another great fire scene was in Christine mm-hmm.

[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:17.260]
That John Stockwell he was really pristine and Christine.

[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:23.460]
Especially when he was laying almost naked there in that hospital bed after he broke his leg in a football game.

[01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:23.940]
Uh huh.

[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:29.040]
He was laying there almost naked in that bed.

[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:38.640]
So Connie says well they they sure got a problem with you all of a sudden since you did a week last week what did you do last week they got them so pissed off.

How can we trust George to tell us what food food is good or bad.

[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:23.880]

Hope he went to the races tomorrow says Connie well thanks Connie and George says thanks to.

[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:40.040]

[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:35.260]
Rupert might act as taken matters into his old hands by replacing me with the new editor Lee Harvey Oswald Jr.

[01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:31.800]
Very jackass had a posting on his blog about the upcoming changes to south photo sports market had blurps from all the GMs.

[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:44.720]
I think you'll notice you were mentioned there as well see below and this is this old stuff about Howard Davis stage manager 790 city would have beaten QM during the day if you compare sports to sports and take me a Roger that they quite this is ancient.

[01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:51.960]
And Joe Bell says this and Howard Davis is that this is older than my god Gabby Hayses hemorrhoids.

[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:57.540]
Jesus God fill arc. Can you believe that I believe it.

[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:04.480]
Now we have a new fake Derek Sanderson. Hey Derek have another drink.

[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:14.860]
X Bruins great and horrible broadcast with a bronze awful. He's no up here McGuire though pop pop pop pop pop pop pop.

[01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:21.560]
No no no no here McGuire you don't hear me require. No just be glad. I am kiss the ground.

[01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:24.140]
There he is.

[01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:25.060]
Who?

[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:26.480]
Here I'm aware.

[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:27.040]
Who's that?

[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:30.080]
He's over.

[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:31.400]
He's over.

[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:31.760]
He's over.

[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:35.680]
He's a guy with a big mouth who never shuts up on a hockey games.

[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:40.540]
And everybody in Canada from coast to coast and all the ships and sea would like to slice

[01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:43.420]
his bald head right off and watch it fall into the lake Ontario.

[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:46.880]
But he just keeps going.

[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:49.000]
And pop, pop, pop, pop, pop and it keeps sticking him on there.

[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:53.320]
Derek Sanderson says, you were speaking of earwax and waist you're moving yesterday.

[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:54.100]
I had the answer.

[01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:55.560]
I'll be it pretty gross.

[01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:03.020]
Also, I used to use self-help and just cram the wax and worse with q-tips, then end up with the ear doctors

[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:04.920]
or a fist and have the wax blown out with warm water.

[01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:10.500]
I remember once coming out of the doctor's office and my ears were so clean when I got into my car I could literally

[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:13.480]
hear and feel the friction of the seat in my back as I slid.

[01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:15.500]
But not to digress.

[01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:21.460]
I'm not, I'm not sure how I discovered it but if you take a simple big pen top, the curved clip part

[01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:24.240]
and carefully scoop the inner ear you can remove the wax.

[01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:25.000]
I do it.

[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:28.360]
Great idea.

[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:29.040]
That's how good.

[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:30.040]
Sounds great.

[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:34.000]
I do it every few days as needed and have never had your wax build up since.

[01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:39.240]
Anyways, works for me a dedicated no-life or money listener and go Panthers in New York tonight.

[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:43.820]
The top from a big pan.

[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:45.900]
Yeah, just stick that in your ear or stick it in your back though.

[01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:47.820]
If you want to stick it, just take your pick it.

[01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:48.760]
Have another drink there.

[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:50.880]
What?

[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:52.580]
I said, take your pick it and stick it.

[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:55.380]
78 certificates left on there out of 100.

[01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:57.800]
We're dying over here.

[01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:03.360]
Okay, South, I remember once upon a time those that had gone in like 20 minutes they'd have been all gone.

[01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:03.880]
Are they all less?

[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:04.580]
Am I right?

[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:05.020]
Yep.

[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:12.780]
So either one or two things nobody's got any money, which is stupid because if they don't have any money they would have like want to save the money on the meal.

[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:15.580]
Or number two we have got nobody listening, which is possible.

[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:16.480]
They have booze there.

[01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:17.580]
You can use it for booze.

[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:22.280]
Use it for food, use it for booze, use it for both either or either.

[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:23.760]
885 on the pool.

[01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:26.060]
We got 900 licked today.

[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:28.140]
Pretty snazzy and it's all because of George.

[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:33.020]
Here's another stupid picture from this Hollister idiot about the Alimie skyline delete immediately.

[01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:35.980]
Keep sending pictures I keep deleting them.

[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:40.820]
Yeah, he's going to impress me with a beautiful Miami skyline.

[01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:42.500]
I don't know and I don't care.

[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:44.220]
Enjoy it.

[01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:48.180]
The fake Larry King says.

[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:54.240]
What is that racket out of the hallway out in your hallway?

[01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:59.900]
Oh, is it a knob or out there?

[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:01.860]
Yeah, there's a robber coming in.

[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.200]
No, the knobber, not the robber.

[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:05.040]
And no, the knobber comes on Monday.

[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:06.660]
Oh, I see the mad knobber.

[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.040]
Fake Larry King says.

[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:10.640]
Think Mr. Ego would like to come in on Monday.

[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:12.020]
Nick Lawrence can sit with George.

[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:13.940]
Brian can do birthday song for you.

[01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:16.300]
Randy doesn't have much going on right now.

[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:18.100]
I'm sure she would come in with Jim and Fat Hank.

[01:53:18.420 --> 01:53:19.220]
Oh, great.

[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:20.920]
From the fake Larry King.

[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:22.700]
Yeah, we're going to have a big party on Monday.

[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:24.580]
Maybe you now have a party here too.

[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:27.880]
With party favors and loans and cupcakes.

[01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:30.000]
I'll bring some party favors, party hat.

[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:30.800]
We do.

[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:31.240]
Yeah.

[01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:33.280]
What do you call those things that you blow up?

[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:35.220]
Those little things.

[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:37.160]
Like the noise makers?

[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:38.900]
Yeah, the noise makers that unfroider.

[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:39.660]
You know you're blowing them.

[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:42.520]
Yeah, like those.

[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:43.340]
What do you call those?

[01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:43.920]
Noise maker.

[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:44.960]
Oh, okay.

[01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:46.360]
It's just what they do.

[01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:49.160]
Floridians, dumb as dirt.

[01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:50.080]
This sucks.

[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:51.080]
Being here sucks.

[01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:52.360]
This works sucks.

[01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:54.700]
We're swearing while we were.

[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.860]
Propanity is making me enjoy my new workplace.

[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:04.520]
So eff you and eff you.

[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:11.960]
Just say it's strong for letters long and say it to my face.

[01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:14.000]
You won't open the room.

[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:16.380]
We all will just assume.

[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:20.660]
When something hits the pan that you don't give a damn it.

[01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:21.780]
Call it more to fool.

[01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:23.360]
What the hell is this crap?

[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:25.640]
Don't fuck me, Lee.

[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:26.880]
Oh, yeah.

[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:28.240]
Sounds like good and plentiful to me.

[01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:32.900]
What happened to George?

[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:33.300]
Great idea.

[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:33.480]
What?

[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:37.980]
Oh, well, every now and then every once in a while you just like clam up, you know.

[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:39.380]
Well, that's because I have a mouthful of food.

[01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:40.140]
Still?

[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:40.780]
Still.

[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:42.600]
Get out of here.

[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:44.420]
I'm eating some fish dip with jalapenos.

[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:46.040]
Get out of here, Greg.

[01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:47.620]
Meg.

[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:48.760]
Whatever the hell it was.

[01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:50.920]
So she's not on here at all now.

[01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:51.600]
I guess not.

[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:52.480]
Wow.

[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:54.100]
How can America continue?

[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:58.800]
How can the president make that assimilating speech the other night without the goddess on here?

[01:54:58.960 --> 01:54:59.240]
77?

[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:01.100]
That's what we got left on these certificates.

[01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:04.700]
How many do you have left last week at the end of the show?

[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:06.560]
All of those.

[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:07.440]
A lot.

[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:08.080]
A lot.

[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:14.200]
I think it must be those, I must be that pole that they're taking across the street.

[01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:15.500]
That's it.

[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:16.360]
They're putting us out of business.

[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:17.880]
Is that what it is?

[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:18.780]
Must be.

[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:20.320]
Well, just keep the checks coming.

[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:24.040]
At least it showed up yesterday on time on the 25th.

[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:26.020]
They are too late and then it usually does though I'll say that.

[01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:29.560]
They better start over nighting it.

[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:31.680]
You know, just like that check I'm going to send out this afternoon.

[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:33.840]
Over nighted.

[01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:34.440]
Not.

[01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:39.080]
John says good and plenty can be bought in the candy section of any dollar store.

[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:42.980]
Since my kids were young, I would take them to buy the movie theater size box for a buck.

[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:44.800]
I pay $375 in the theater.

[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:46.160]
Oh.

[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:49.440]
You know, some people don't like black licorice.

[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:52.140]
Maybe most people don't, but I do.

[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:53.720]
It's not the licorice part.

[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:56.200]
I don't like the candy mixed in with it.

[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:56.440]
All right.

[01:55:57.980 --> 01:56:00.080]
I don't like the pink and purple mung.

[01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:02.460]
I hope you ever have any.

[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:02.860]
What?

[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:05.220]
Like that shredded coconut in the mountains bars.

[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:06.480]
Don't like it.

[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:09.020]
I don't buy mounds bars.

[01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:10.740]
In fact, I don't see mounds bars anywhere.

[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:14.800]
Doesn't it, it doesn't, it's not Mars bar.

[01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:16.780]
Didn't you have like a little nut on top?

[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:17.960]
I think it doesn't anymore.

[01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:18.540]
You did?

[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:19.260]
I don't know.

[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:20.880]
What do you know?

[01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:22.120]
You don't know anything about candy.

[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:22.420]
That's right.

[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:23.500]
I don't know anything about anything.

[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:24.620]
No, you do, but you don't.

[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:26.020]
One thing you don't know about is candy.

[01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:26.340]
Yeah.

[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:27.980]
You don't know your candy.

[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:29.100]
You don't know your Mary Jane.

[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:30.220]
You know the wrong kind of Mary Jane.

[01:56:30.220 --> 01:56:30.660]
Oh, yes.

[01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:31.500]
That's all about Mary Jane.

[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:31.960]
Trust me.

[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:33.700]
Hope you have a happy anniversary next week.

[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:36.840]
I know this will be the year that WKM will send you over that card and compliment her.

[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:37.300]
Your gift badge.

[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:38.600]
Stay well, John and Lakeworth.

[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:39.720]
Not going to happen, John.

[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:41.420]
They're not going to send me squad.

[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:42.740]
And that's fine.

[01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:45.780]
They don't like me, so I don't like them.

[01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:46.340]
They hit us.

[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:46.940]
We hit them back.

[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:47.560]
You know, like that.

[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:48.440]
Just like that.

[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:53.260]
We had Bruno to tell you four o'clock this morning.

[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:54.720]
Was it four o'clock or three o'clock?

[01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:57.000]
Four o'clock.

[01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:57.520]
Four o'clock?

[01:56:57.720 --> 01:56:58.340]
I don't know.

[01:56:58.440 --> 01:56:58.840]
I don't know.

[01:56:58.960 --> 01:56:59.040]
I don't know.

[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:00.360]
I'm not going to have to look at him.

[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:02.860]
It's like these people with their trivia, with their neal trivia.

[01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:06.500]
Oh, it didn't used to talk up to this song and Ricky Tiki hated it.

[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:08.000]
Oh, my God.

[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:13.560]
I think some of these people are trying to parlay us off the air and doing a pretty good

[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:13.880]
job.

[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:14.580]
Four o'clock.

[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:16.500]
That's what I said.

[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:17.560]
Four o'clock this morning.

[01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:18.820]
We hit Bruno to tell you.

[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.960]
Here is one really interesting.

[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:25.180]
Was it the black current or the red current you had?

[01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:25.740]
It was red.

[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:28.820]
In the public sense, I was beach to have a section of ethnic food from England.

[01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:31.080]
Basically, just the kosher food section.

[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:34.340]
Mostly stuff nobody would buy unless you were a silly Brit missing home.

[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:38.140]
One of the items there is Robert's in black current jam.

[01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:41.160]
Also, I believe the Epicure market cares other current products.

[01:57:41.780 --> 01:57:43.140]
Well, it's one thing about us on the show.

[01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:44.700]
We want to remain current.

[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:49.160]
Don't we?

[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:50.720]
I never saw black currents.

[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:51.080]
Did you?

[01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:51.820]
I don't know.

[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:52.120]
Maybe.

[01:57:52.420 --> 01:57:53.940]
Well, leave it to the bridge to screw it up.

[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:55.740]
They could take anything really good and screw it up.

[01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:58.360]
Red currents, little tiny red.

[01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:02.380]
They're like miniature, I don't know.

[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:04.200]
What you call them?

[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:04.820]
Miniature fruits.

[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:05.380]
Okay.

[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:06.100]
Mini fruit.

[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:07.000]
Mini fruit.

[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:08.760]
Mini fruit.

[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:10.140]
I've seen a few of those.

[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:12.740]
We've all seen some mini fruits.

[01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:14.520]
77.

[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:15.680]

[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:18.620]
Oh, almost said we got a chunk over there, kegs south of Kendall on our.

[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:20.800]
It's on wdqam.com, by the way.

[01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:23.480]
Don't be looking to Neil Rogers.com.

[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:24.760]
WDQam.com.

[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:27.600]
And they finally took that big air conditioning thing or whatever was off my face.

[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:31.440]
So you can actually find it so don't use that as an excuse.

[01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:33.460]
Oh, well, we couldn't find it on the site.

[01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:33.720]
Yeah.

[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.640]
Neil wqam.com.

[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:37.080]
You got 71.

[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:38.980]
It's a lot less than 77.

[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:41.180]
And we still got an hour and 14 minutes to go.

[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:42.600]
Damn it.

[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:47.660]
Lefty says we love the show out here at Little Design House in West Palm.

[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:53.840]
Some days the ladies make us turn the channel to 101.5 FM or listen to love songs and crap.

[01:58:54.900 --> 01:58:57.100]
The ladies will not let us listen to rapper Harry Metta.

[01:58:57.240 --> 01:59:00.260]
So we have to make playlists that respect the ladies or were headphones.

[01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:03.220]
Headphones can be very uns sociable.

[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:04.560]
So I thought you'd find interesting note.

[01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:07.260]
The ladies or mostly young find your show very funny.

[01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:07.960]
The ladies.

[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:14.000]
So does dirty santae's gay bill on the proofreader who doesn't deserve you to say his name on the area.

[01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:16.700]
That this is so illiterate and so stupid.

[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:17.440]
It's just pathetic.

[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:22.440]
Yesterday the dude who said you can clean out your throat and clean yours at the same time was right.

[01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:25.240]
I think he meant that you need to do the pig snort clearing of the throat.

[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:26.820]
Then you suck air to whatever.

[01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:29.960]
This is this year right.

[01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:31.760]
This is a new level.

[01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:37.460]
When you can set a new level of loneliness on our email standard then you really can know seriously.

[01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:39.780]
That takes some real talent.

[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:40.140]
Right.

[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:41.900]
Expect nothing all time low.

[01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:42.880]
What?

[01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:44.680]
Expect nothing in your lawn.

[01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:45.460]
Never be disappointed.

[01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:46.120]
Yeah.

[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:48.160]
That's what we've only said about the South Florida market.

[01:59:48.260 --> 01:59:48.860]
Expect nothing.

[01:59:48.980 --> 01:59:49.700]
They'll never let you down.

[01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:51.920]
But thanks for reminding me because I forgot to do that.

[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:52.660]
What?

[01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:55.100]
Clean my ears and clear my throat at the same time.

[01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:56.880]
I'll try it in my shower.

[01:59:57.180 --> 02:00:02.360]
I'll tell you what really is the best is when you like fart and clean your ears and clear your throat at the same time.

[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:02.720]
Wow.

[02:00:03.740 --> 02:00:04.540]
That's gotta be.

[02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:07.240]
You gotta keep a cute tip handy.

[02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:08.040]
Yeah.

[02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:08.960]
Because you never know.

[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:10.960]
You never know where you're going to need to sleep.

[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:14.100]
Well you never know when you're going to fart unless you can do it at will.

[02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:17.700]
I'm very proud of myself about farting in the elevator the other night.

[02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:18.720]
A couple nights ago that was good.

[02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:24.820]
Oh, um, Paco lost not he misplaced his past card.

[02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:26.680]
You know for the building again for the 400 time.

[02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:32.120]
You know how they have in apartment buildings they have those cards security cards.

[02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:34.880]
Well he was placed in a lot of the bar mine for the eight minutes time.

[02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:41.760]
What is it with kids if their neck wasn't if their head wasn't sewn on by their neck they would like lose that too?

[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:42.520]
Correct.

[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:44.180]
All of them.

[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:45.880]
Most of them.

[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:47.160]
Many of them.

[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:48.040]
This one.

[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:48.540]
Yes.

[02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:53.780]
PD says since it seems to be medical talk today my right thumbnail has been cracking down the middle for the last year.

[02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:54.680]
Well not a shame.

[02:00:55.220 --> 02:00:59.820]
It really hurts when you catch the cracked part and tears down the middle like when I put my hand in my pants.

[02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:00.500]
What can I do?

[02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:04.120]
Well could put in your hand and your pants is one good start.

[02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:09.700]
And yes I hate George like poison and a kid has said the other day that he liked the wow wow drop.

[02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:10.880]
He was talking about the.

[02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:11.320]
Wow.

[02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:12.420]
No he wasn't.

[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:14.520]
I don't know what he was talking about neither of he.

[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:18.780]
And what's up with that bag of gas Randy wrote she's not only are any more good riddances.

[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:22.100]
PD who's obviously sour on everybody on life sour.

[02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:27.240]
Really sour I like sweet and sour in fact that sounds like a good Chinese lunch today.

[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:29.720]
That chicken.

[02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:31.620]
Yeah.

[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:33.500]
Yeah chicken.

[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.240]
So straight dog here is opposed to gay Ted says this one.

[02:01:39.020 --> 02:01:44.500]
George is a fine job on the year even though I don't rule this case stories of fun adventure are entertaining and fun.

[02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:49.680]
Listen to I use Q tips to clean my ears every morning after shower and floss my teeth every day.

[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:51.780]
Oh you're so boring straight dog.

[02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:58.560]
Boring I wish I could remember to floss but it's a pain in the ass.

[02:01:58.740 --> 02:01:59.180]
Yeah.

[02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:01.760]
It's supposed to always ask you that when you're going to get your teeth clean.

[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:02.780]
No I don't.

[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:03.700]
Are you flossing every day?

[02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:07.360]
Well if I was flossing every day would my teeth be bleeding like a stuck pig here.

[02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:10.540]
My gums are bleeding like a gusher.

[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:14.040]
You're supposed to hear someone from Greg.

[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:17.420]
I've been away for several weeks and just returned to my orifice.

[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:20.800]
I'm fortunate to have taken an African safari while on holiday.

[02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:26.840]
While I where I bagged several beasts for which to display other heads on my wall.

[02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:28.000]
This is really boring.

[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:34.700]
You'll be sorry to learn I'm no longer offer you my advice to improve your show.

[02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:35.240]
Good.

[02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:36.360]
Thank you.

[02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:36.800]
Go away.

[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:38.280]
Go back to Africa.

[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:43.180]
Is Chicks and Sticks toasted, coke on a covered mong, black?

[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:45.300]
What is that?

[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:46.160]
Chicks and Sticks?

[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:46.780]
Never heard of it.

[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:47.560]
I know either.

[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:50.600]
By the way the best candy is Mallow Cups.

[02:02:50.900 --> 02:02:54.100]
I don't want to say it's the best but it sure is one of my favorites and I haven't seen it in about a hundred years.

[02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:55.680]
I love those.

[02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:58.780]
You got a real goopy marshmallow inside you know.

[02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:01.280]
You know Jackson's over here that we've spoken of.

[02:03:01.420 --> 02:03:03.160]
But I don't want I'm not that's why I'm not there.

[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:03.580]
Good.

[02:03:04.460 --> 02:03:05.560]
You're going to die in here.

[02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:06.760]
They have Mallow Cups?

[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:09.500]
They have all the old fashioned candies.

[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:10.400]
Even Mary Jane?

[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:11.100]
I submitted.

[02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:16.900]
And the great part as a kid was you could save the cars they were on and you collected a certain number of points you get a free candy.

[02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:17.380]
That's right.

[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:18.880]
I forgot that.

[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:19.520]
Mallow Cups.

[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:21.120]
You give you a save of much of those little cards.

[02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:21.640]
That's right.

[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:23.300]
And you get a candy.

[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:28.320]
Pedro says the ones I like were the good and fruity similar to the Skittles nowadays.

[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:32.460]
Good and plenty gave me good and plenty of spilkeys says Pedro.

[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:38.540]
You'd love the way that Pedro well guy named Pedro and going to be spell and spilkeys too well.

[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.760]
899 on the public at 900 look we can do 950 today.

[02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:45.660]
That would be really special.

[02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:48.760]
That would be as impressive as all get out.

[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:49.280]
69.

[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:50.880]
I don't know if we can say that.

[02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:51.520]
Call of joy.

[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:52.460]
See if we can say 69.

[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:55.740]
That's how many certificates we got left for K South of Kendall.

[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:00.760]
Maybe we don't have a whole big audience in Kendall anymore.

[02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:02.400]
Maybe.

[02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:04.140]
Maybe no.

[02:04:04.580 --> 02:04:05.400]
Abla in glaze.

[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:06.240]
A key.

[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:08.100]
You think?

[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:11.720]
No, I think that it's just the economy.

[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:15.340]
And you know that the $50 certificate always moves slower than the $100.

[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:16.920]
No, they don't.

[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:22.500]
Two weeks ago we had a hundred and we sold them out like in four shakes of a ass whale.

[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:25.160]
Well, I'm all out of ideas.

[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:27.540]
I'm not asking for any ideas.

[02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:28.940]
Look, like I always say it is.

[02:04:28.940 --> 02:04:33.400]
We have so much pressure put on us for like the thing with me with the horse race tomorrow.

[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:35.720]
I got an 11 horse race.

[02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:38.600]
The horses in that race I wouldn't wish on Genghis Khan.

[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:38.980]
Okay.

[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:44.420]
I already took a brief puke at it and I'm thinking to myself, I'm going to pick a winner in this race.

[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:45.880]
Well, there's bound to be one in there somewhere.

[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:51.320]
And maybe I can get the tip from that to New Yorkie guy that does the handicapping for them.

[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:53.580]
You know on the TV thing, oh my god, that guy.

[02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:55.700]
It's so New Yorkie.

[02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:59.140]
By the way, you'll be interested in know he also picked last week.

[02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:03.120]
He did not pick the one that I had two weeks ago that one by seven and a half lengths.

[02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:06.220]
The one with the Sicilian name, whatever the hell it was.

[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:11.600]
But he also picked guns and roses and noses and blozes.

[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:12.460]
And what was it last week?

[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:13.200]
Booger Booger?

[02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:15.940]
Dr. Google's that said very good.

[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:17.020]
What a memory.

[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:17.380]
Wow.

[02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:18.820]
You're getting like me.

[02:05:18.940 --> 02:05:20.200]
You got a real good memory for crap.

[02:05:22.220 --> 02:05:25.580]
Bob Bees says, wanted to wish you congratulations on your upcoming anniversary.

[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:28.660]
Can't believe you made it in this market as long as you have neither can I.

[02:05:29.420 --> 02:05:30.580]
You're a true survivor.

[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:31.280]
A quick story.

[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:36.580]
I think it was your 25th anniversary when I sent you an old WLD hand fan that had your picture in it.

[02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:41.760]
I found it unfortunately in my deceased brother-in-law's apartment that my wife and I had to clean out.

[02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:44.400]
I remember those hand fans that had my picture on them.

[02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:45.140]
Those were nifty.

[02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:47.760]
He was a huge nealy.

[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:49.600]
And when I found it, I had to send it to you.

[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:52.340]
You must have had a son sent a report doing a story and you that day.

[02:05:52.840 --> 02:05:56.820]
The picture in the paper showed you up holding the picture fan in front of your face.

[02:05:57.120 --> 02:05:58.420]
Needless to say, I was touched.

[02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:01.760]
So have a great day and don't let the A-holes get to you.

[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:04.860]
I'm your friend in the Florida Keys, Bob Bees.

[02:06:04.860 --> 02:06:05.540]
He's our friend.

[02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:07.340]
I remember those fans.

[02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:08.780]
Boy, that's a long time ago.

[02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:10.380]
Well, officially done eating by the way.

[02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:12.000]
Yeah.

[02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:13.620]
Just see the guys gone.

[02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:14.140]
Keep in track.

[02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:14.820]
Yeah, they're done.

[02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:20.140]
I'm kind of embarrassed when they're still there to talk about how few we've sold and like that.

[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:21.700]
It's just, it puts added pressure.

[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:24.160]
903 on a pole.

[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:25.100]
We're kicking ass there.

[02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:32.860]
We're definitely not kicking ass on the still 69 on Keg South of Kendall $50 certificates for 25 bucks.

[02:06:33.340 --> 02:06:35.100]
I'm, you know, we're doing what we're doing.

[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:39.140]
We knew the best we can and nobody's got two nickels to rub together.

[02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:39.780]
That's the problem.

[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:39.980]
Right.

[02:06:40.180 --> 02:06:41.820]
People are now eating like probably dog food.

[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:45.040]
Let us know how the Alpo is where they have to heat it up.

[02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:46.800]
We have to nuke it or what the deal is.

[02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:47.200]
Okay.

[02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:51.580]
No, I wasn't talking about you, but all of you might fall into that category.

[02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:54.640]
What are you, a charlotte churlin about?

[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:56.720]
Oh, I told myself a joke I'd never heard before.

[02:06:57.300 --> 02:06:58.000]
Just this morning.

[02:06:58.560 --> 02:06:59.200]
That's right.

[02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:07.200]
Paul says a few months ago, I moved down to Fort Lauderdale from Michigan to do my job.

[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:10.140]
I find your show and I love it.

[02:07:10.140 --> 02:07:10.880]
I think George is great.

[02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:12.900]
Also, thank you to the great job when he filled in for you.

[02:07:13.300 --> 02:07:17.980]
The only problem that I have with your show is that I have no clue who you're talking about when you reference certain people.

[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:25.300]
Who is Greg Budell and a whole, a makefully broadcaster, a legend in his own mind,

[02:07:25.460 --> 02:07:29.360]
somebody who I've worked in to some little boat punk town in Alabama,

[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:34.600]
who used to be a waiter with the sterling country kitchen when my mother lived there in carriage hills.

[02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:37.000]
Who is that?

[02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:43.140]
That person.

[02:07:44.180 --> 02:07:44.780]
That person.

[02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:44.780]

[02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:45.220]
That person.

[02:07:45.220 --> 02:07:45.540]
That person.

[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:49.040]
That person.

[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:49.040]

[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:49.100]
That person.

[02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:49.480]
That person.

[02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:49.940]
That person.

[02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:50.800]
That person.

[02:07:50.900 --> 02:07:52.400]
That person.

[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:53.760]
That person.

[02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:55.400]
That person.

[02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:55.520]
That person.

[02:07:55.940 --> 02:07:56.160]
That person.

[02:07:56.160 --> 02:07:56.160]

[02:07:56.160 --> 02:07:56.160]

[02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:56.980]
That person.

[02:07:56.980 --> 02:07:56.980]

[02:07:57.180 --> 02:07:57.480]
That person.

[02:07:58.060 --> 02:07:58.640]
That person.

[02:07:58.720 --> 02:07:58.820]
That person.

[02:07:58.820 --> 02:07:59.240]
That person.

[02:07:59.460 --> 02:07:59.960]
That person.

[02:08:00.380 --> 02:08:00.540]
That person.

[02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:00.940]
That person.

[02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:01.500]
That person.

[02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:03.200]
That person.

[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:04.000]
That person.

[02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:11.920]
That person.

[02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:12.440]
That person.

[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:14.660]
That person.

[02:08:14.660 --> 02:08:14.680]
That person.

[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:15.100]
That person.

[02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:17.160]
That person.

[02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:18.340]
That person.

[02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:19.520]
That person.

[02:08:19.940 --> 02:08:19.940]

[02:08:32.300 --> 02:08:33.160]
Options.

[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:33.180]
I would say this book on sale.

[02:08:33.180 --> 02:08:33.180]

[02:08:33.180 --> 02:08:33.180]

[02:08:33.180 --> 02:08:33.180]

[02:08:33.180 --> 02:08:33.180]

[02:08:38.900 --> 02:08:40.680]
I'm not here to say that I'm sorry.

[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:42.800]
I'll be honest with you.

[02:08:43.100 --> 02:08:45.200]
Today I have plans to do steroids.

[02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:51.120]
Now the next step is to address the media about what I took and where it came from.

[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:55.000]
Alex, you talked about the performance enhancing drugs.

[02:08:55.500 --> 02:08:57.400]
You just continued the use wrong.

[02:08:57.660 --> 02:08:57.820]
Why?

[02:08:58.460 --> 02:08:59.380]
I didn't stop.

[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:01.900]
I keep going back to steroids.

[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:04.420]
I just injected.

[02:09:05.060 --> 02:09:08.540]
Before I walk here today, some people may refer to this as cheating.

[02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:09.760]
How do you address parents now?

[02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:13.380]
How to talk to their kids about the fact that you profited from this?

[02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:15.480]
First thing I said, a parent just said on it.

[02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:19.620]
Hey, if I had a son, I would definitely recommend steroid abuse.

[02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:21.100]
I thank you for being here.

[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:21.900]
Thank you.

[02:09:22.780 --> 02:09:23.680]
Yes, sit on this.

[02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:25.420]
101 at 5.60.

[02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:27.020]
25 million year to cheat.

[02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:29.740]
Pay fraud, pay fraud, pay roids.

[02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:31.160]
And you know what?

[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:31.600]
Who cares?

[02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:33.520]
Oh, baseball's starting real soon.

[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:34.920]
You'll have a good good for you.

[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:35.720]
Don't care.

[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:39.420]
The gravity guy says, Ray Irwax.

[02:09:39.540 --> 02:09:39.680]
What?

[02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:41.220]
That's your guy listening to big responses.

[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:42.080]
They're anti-bid.

[02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:42.540]
They too.

[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:46.580]
They care a lot more about Irwax than about my fingers and my funger woman.

[02:09:46.900 --> 02:09:47.800]
Although I'll tell you one thing.

[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:49.040]
I smeared some of that stuff again.

[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:49.720]
Yep.

[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:53.780]
And boy, they're looking still a little bit red-neurotated in between those two fingers.

[02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:57.160]
But looking better.

[02:09:57.260 --> 02:09:57.360]
Better?

[02:09:59.280 --> 02:09:59.740]
Nutrogenia, man.

[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:02.720]
Well, if you're lucky, that's all it is, is a dry skin situation.

[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:04.000]
Dry skin from winter.

[02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:06.700]
How about if I smeared some on my back bone and lactose?

[02:10:07.220 --> 02:10:08.000]
It won't be dry anymore.

[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:08.500]
That's for sure.

[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:09.220]
Well, wet ass.

[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:13.300]
It says, I don't know if you brought this up already, but the subject of Irwax

[02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:15.840]
reminds me of an occasion on the old Rick and Sudge show on IOD.

[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:16.580]
Wow.

[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:21.320]
So this must be from another one of those people, another one of that crowd.

[02:10:22.220 --> 02:10:26.260]
When they brought in a lady who was selling an Irwax cure that employed lit candles.

[02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:27.100]
Yes.

[02:10:27.420 --> 02:10:29.760]
They even did demonstrations read in the studio during the show.

[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:38.400]
I remember Rick giving the disgusting details about how much yellow and green gunk kept dripping out of people's ears while the hot candles somehow drew out all this bans of, I vaguely remember that.

[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:38.960]
Yep.

[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:39.340]
I do.

[02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:42.780]
I think it was eventually proven to be some kind of scam.

[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:43.080]
It is.

[02:10:43.100 --> 02:10:44.380]
Well, not on the Rick Riley show.

[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:46.680]
You know, so I left Sudge off of that.

[02:10:46.860 --> 02:10:48.140]
It's like a copper bracelet thing.

[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:50.100]
Yeah, just like that.

[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:54.900]
All the Mexicans buy that stuff copper bracelets and your people too.

[02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:55.120]
Yep.

[02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:55.600]
Sorry.

[02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:57.900]
Well, everybody's got their thing.

[02:10:58.060 --> 02:10:58.520]
I get in.

[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:00.480]
I beg your pardon?

[02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:02.520]
I said, what a shame.

[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:03.260]
Out to Lasis.

[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:03.540]
Yes.

[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:05.480]
For me, I'm with my pal George.

[02:11:05.740 --> 02:11:08.040]
I use Q tips after showering to dry or clean out the wax.

[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:11.180]
I remember my late father would just stick in the car keys to clean out the wax.

[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:13.120]
That's really classy.

[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:15.220]
That's really crazy.

[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:16.620]
Stick in the chassis, man.

[02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:17.760]
I use a knife.

[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:19.240]
I stick the car keys in your ear.

[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:20.420]
I use a putter knife.

[02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:22.760]
I wonder where that expression came from.

[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:23.640]
Stick it in your ear.

[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:25.040]
I don't know.

[02:11:25.780 --> 02:11:28.760]
It's better than some of the other places they could say to stick in your ear.

[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:32.120]
Now, whatever happened to all others, this one.

[02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:34.160]
You've got to stick your stool in it.

[02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:34.840]
Don't worry.

[02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:35.620]
It's not going to break.

[02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:38.220]
And there's always the classy Sally fits.

[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:39.240]
Dig it up.

[02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:40.540]
Dig it up.

[02:11:40.980 --> 02:11:42.120]
One more time, Sally.

[02:11:42.740 --> 02:11:43.340]
Dig it up.

[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:45.560]
I remember that.

[02:11:45.980 --> 02:11:47.440]
During the hurricane, during Andrew.

[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:48.620]
During a live broadcast.

[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:51.460]
During a live broadcast on Channel 7, here's Sally fits.

[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:52.340]
Stick it up your head.

[02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:53.660]
Well, she just, I don't know.

[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:56.020]
And the funny part is they told her she was on the air and she said,

[02:11:56.180 --> 02:11:57.740]
we'll stick it up your ass the second time.

[02:11:58.040 --> 02:11:58.260]
Yeah.

[02:12:00.940 --> 02:12:02.740]
She was a little surly and scruly.

[02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:05.700]
And I think that was what her problem was.

[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.300]
You know how many people remember that confrontation?

[02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:09.580]
What?

[02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:11.020]
You know how many people?

[02:12:11.460 --> 02:12:15.720]
I guess it wasn't you, but it was somebody at the station got confronted by her.

[02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:17.660]
I got confronted by her in the parking lot.

[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:18.840]
About that.

[02:12:18.940 --> 02:12:20.060]
How many people tell me?

[02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:23.400]
I remember that part of it.

[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:24.540]
Oh, that must have been somebody.

[02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:28.780]
I remember her saying to me, oh yeah, I hear some of the things you say about me and I don't like it.

[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:33.200]
And I said, but you know what, Sally, it's a radio show lighten up.

[02:12:33.540 --> 02:12:34.480]
Oh, I don't like it.

[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:35.580]
Too bad, screw you.

[02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:37.560]
And quit putting coke bottles up your ass.

[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:38.360]
You like it?

[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:39.760]
God.

[02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:45.020]
I don't know if she liked it after that, but I don't think she quit with the coke bottles.

[02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:46.100]
There are other objects.

[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:49.580]
Maybe, yeah, maybe they were the object of her affection.

[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:53.640]
Should they have that's a possibility?

[02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:55.860]
No comment.

[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:00.740]
Here's one who says, get ready for mass coverage of the new White House dog.

[02:13:00.740 --> 02:13:01.400]
Enough already.

[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:05.920]
Hey, George, getting ready to snowmobile today in Yellowstone National Park, throwing like hell.

[02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:06.560]
Fantastic.

[02:13:07.020 --> 02:13:07.440]
Very jealous.

[02:13:07.740 --> 02:13:08.300]
Says T.

[02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:09.460]
You know T?

[02:13:09.740 --> 02:13:09.920]
No.

[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:10.960]
No, but I know yellowstone.

[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:12.880]
Maybe he's hanging out in the T room at Yellowstone.

[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:15.860]
Oh, it would be fun.

[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:20.580]
Daisy, who just continues being, I don't know what to say about her.

[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:21.640]
Maybe me to Daisy now.

[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:23.480]
What?

[02:13:23.860 --> 02:13:25.580]
So you're going to be me to Daisy now too.

[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:27.160]
Yes, I'm going to be me to all of them.

[02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:27.500]
Yeah.

[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:35.320]
I bet if you looked at Paiyush Jindal, their web series, it says redneck Indian next to his pictures is Daisy.

[02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:40.620]
Now here's a little clip about Paiyush Jindal, which you probably haven't heard about Bobby.

[02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:42.260]
That'll, how you pick that name.

[02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:55.740]
Paiyush Jindal was born to Punjabi, Punjabi Indian immigrants, Amar and Raj Jindal, who would recently arrive for Amar to attend graduate school LSU.

[02:13:56.500 --> 02:13:58.360]
Right from, I think this is butchered.

[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:02.980]
His father, Amar, left in Janazan's ancestral family village of Kampura in 1970.

[02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:10.080]
His mother, Amar, is an information technology director for the Louisiana Department of Labor according to the family lore.

[02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:13.100]
Jindal, oh, I see there's a sense of a period there.

[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:19.160]
According to family lore, Jindal chose to rename himself Bobby, inspired by the sitcom character.

[02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:23.480]
And do you ever be talking about yesterday what sitcom boy, that's just amazing how psychic I am.

[02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:27.000]
Da da da da da da da da da da da da Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

[02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:27.500]
Oh really?

[02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:37.400]
He decided to rename himself Bobby, inspired by the sitcom character Bobby Brady, after watching the Brady Bunch TV series at the age of four.

[02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:41.860]
Is that pathetic or what?

[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:43.620]
Yeah, let me develop this.

[02:14:43.620 --> 02:14:47.900]
He has been known by himself and often nickname ever since as a civil servant, politician, student and writer.

[02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:51.820]
Even though legally his name remains Paiyush Jindal, he's Punjabi.

[02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:55.880]
At least he ain't no smelly Chinese man, but he's a punjabi.

[02:14:58.900 --> 02:14:59.780]
What the hell was that?

[02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:00.440]
What?

[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:01.400]
I don't know.

[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:04.140]
Somebody upstairs just rolled dice on the floor or something.

[02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:05.120]
I don't know what's going on.

[02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:07.380]
Bobby Brady.

[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:11.860]
I think we're getting even more insight into his Brady intellect.

[02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:14.620]
A guy that wrote the other day, oh he's not an idiot.

[02:15:14.860 --> 02:15:16.100]
He's a, yeah, all this other crap.

[02:15:16.380 --> 02:15:18.840]
Just because somebody doesn't agree with me, he doesn't make them an idiot.

[02:15:18.980 --> 02:15:20.040]
Well, I disagree with that.

[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:20.920]
Yeah.

[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:21.160]
Yeah.

[02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:22.920]
They disagree with me.

[02:15:23.060 --> 02:15:24.180]
They're an idiot right on.

[02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:28.960]
And if they disagree with George, well, he thinks they're an idiot.

[02:15:30.540 --> 02:15:31.960]
GM burning through cash.

[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:33.760]
Oh, let's give another $50 trillion.

[02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:37.460]
This year GM is asking Uncle Sam for another $16 billion.

[02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:38.780]
There are no promises here today.

[02:15:38.900 --> 02:15:41.540]
Representative from the company are in Washington again.

[02:15:42.020 --> 02:15:47.360]
And the company meanwhile is currently offering buyouts wanting to flush up to 50,000 jobs

[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:49.100]
as far as stock reaction.

[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:51.540]
Well, GM shares right now are down 5.5%.

[02:15:52.100 --> 02:15:53.320]
Sounds like a big move, right?

[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:54.340]
$0.14.

[02:15:54.580 --> 02:16:00.120]
Care of $0.14 because it's share price is so low below $2.50.

[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:03.120]
Overall, the Dow is hanging on.

[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:07.740]
Yeah, the Dow is up 27 points, but it's that lead there is vanishing.

[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:12.640]
It's like a horse at the top of the stretch that's going to its hands and knees, gasping

[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:13.220]
for oxygen.

[02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:15.680]
You know what I mean?

[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:16.260]
Yep.

[02:16:16.260 --> 02:16:21.200]
And that lead, that eight length lead is now down to six and five and all of a sudden

[02:16:21.200 --> 02:16:25.380]
the whole field is catching and they come to the top of the stretch and the whole field

[02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:30.900]
passes him like he's standing like he's on the ground puking and gasping.

[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:35.240]
Well, it's going to run very well in here and there's that guy that New Yorkie guy from

[02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:35.540]
Boston.

[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:36.160]
Very nice.

[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:39.460]
And number four, decap again, getting off the turf.

[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:41.140]
So is number two Irish sport.

[02:16:41.380 --> 02:16:42.680]
Well, let's do a costume today.

[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:43.160]
What are you saying?

[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:43.860]
Get it over with.

[02:16:43.860 --> 02:16:45.040]
Well, let me get out there.

[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:46.720]
We'll use these selections for tomorrow.

[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:47.180]
Well, that's right.

[02:16:47.300 --> 02:16:48.220]
Georgia's going to be there tomorrow.

[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:51.580]
Keep forgetting to read your promo because I got a buried under the schedule.

[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:52.160]
It's high.

[02:16:53.100 --> 02:16:54.380]
Well, let me un-variate.

[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:55.540]
Now, it's still buried.

[02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:57.060]
It's under, well, let me put it here.

[02:16:58.040 --> 02:16:59.060]
I don't want to not read it.

[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:00.760]
Then you'll accuse me.

[02:17:00.820 --> 02:17:03.940]
Oh, nobody showed up to see me because the old man wouldn't promote it.

[02:17:04.060 --> 02:17:04.140]
Yeah.

[02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:06.080]
It's not about getting people to show up.

[02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:07.360]
What is it about?

[02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:09.300]
Well, we got sixty five for sitting against life by the way.

[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:09.960]
That's not so bad.

[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:11.020]
It's not good, but right.

[02:17:11.460 --> 02:17:11.700]
What?

[02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:12.900]
It's about getting a free lunch.

[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:22.340]
Well, that sure doesn't sound very, uh, what?

[02:17:22.940 --> 02:17:24.140]
I'm scratching my head.

[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:25.900]
I'm hoping to get some skin.

[02:17:26.220 --> 02:17:26.760]
The skin.

[02:17:27.180 --> 02:17:27.900]
Give me some skin.

[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:29.300]
I smell it.

[02:17:29.420 --> 02:17:30.060]
Don't smell like nothing.

[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:31.220]
I don't have no fungus.

[02:17:31.380 --> 02:17:33.500]
I guess a fungal infection is like nasty, huh?

[02:17:33.900 --> 02:17:35.360]
It can be or not.

[02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:37.660]
Like smells really bad.

[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:38.480]
I think they're in luck.

[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:39.420]
Like death.

[02:17:39.420 --> 02:17:39.780]
Maybe.

[02:17:39.980 --> 02:17:40.260]
Maybe.

[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:41.280]
I'm dying of it.

[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:41.940]
That could be it.

[02:17:42.060 --> 02:17:42.360]
That's it.

[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:43.180]
You got gangrene.

[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:51.500]
I hadn't got gangrene in my spleen said that famous driver Barry Trin from Fraser Downs.

[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:55.940]
I bet you won't hear about that on the Jorge Zidano show about Barry Trin and Bill Davis

[02:17:55.940 --> 02:17:56.940]
and Bill Davis, Jr.

[02:17:57.880 --> 02:17:58.620]
You won't hear about them.

[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:03.380]
And the anxious Cliff Orington, Jr.

[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:05.120]
Clint, whatever's name it.

[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:06.100]
Cliff Orington, Jr.

[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:11.680]
Sixty five left on the certificates for care South of Kindle.

[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:12.760]
And there they are for you.

[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:14.960]
$50 certificates in pages 25 bucks.

[02:18:17.660 --> 02:18:19.540]
I think we're talking to an empty house today.

[02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:20.800]
Is there something going on?

[02:18:20.940 --> 02:18:23.180]
I don't know about like here in the building.

[02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:24.900]
No, like in town.

[02:18:24.900 --> 02:18:25.720]
I don't know.

[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:26.300]
I know about either.

[02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:28.220]
So if there's a party, I would have been big going on.

[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:30.000]
Something really big.

[02:18:32.820 --> 02:18:35.500]
And speaking of that next Thursday, we got the trend coming out.

[02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:35.780]
Wow.

[02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:38.520]
Yeah, we got the first trend of the winter book.

[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:43.420]
And then starting in April, we start with those people, people, people, people,

[02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:44.920]
purple people, either meters.

[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:48.520]
And won't that be something?

[02:18:48.980 --> 02:18:49.080]
Yep.

[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:54.260]
Now we still haven't come to any kind of a conclusion about those ratings and the bonuses

[02:18:54.260 --> 02:18:55.560]
whether they're going to be like on a monthly.

[02:18:55.860 --> 02:18:57.580]
We still haven't come to any conclusion about that.

[02:18:57.980 --> 02:19:01.960]
And that's because Norma Canvas too busy sending out press releases about his stupid ass blog.

[02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:08.200]
And about his highly rated morning show on WFTLA 50, which he never had a morning show on that.

[02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:14.220]
On that FTL, but nevertheless, this is the life we have chosen.

[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:15.640]
That's right.

[02:19:16.340 --> 02:19:18.180]
Michael, we're bigger than US steel.

[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:21.360]
Remember that scene?

[02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:22.020]
Oh, yeah.

[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:25.160]
Heiman Roth.

[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:27.940]
Now he's dead now.

[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:28.700]
He's need least prosper.

[02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:29.220]
Oh, yeah.

[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:30.360]
Really?

[02:19:30.540 --> 02:19:31.400]
Remember, he was ailing.

[02:19:31.620 --> 02:19:33.100]
He was coughing up blood during that movie.

[02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:33.900]
That's what that quaggle was.

[02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:35.980]
Well, who was the other one who was dying during a movie during?

[02:19:37.500 --> 02:19:38.900]
Oh, he was certainly hating.

[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:39.400]
Magnolia.

[02:19:39.800 --> 02:19:41.420]
Oh, during Magnolia, Jason Robards.

[02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:42.820]
Jason Robards, that's right.

[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:46.880]
He had a little booze problem all of his life and then he started dying.

[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:50.600]
Yeah, well, wasn't a problem until later when he killed him by that.

[02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:52.460]
Wasn't a problem up until it killed him.

[02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:53.320]
Right.

[02:19:53.500 --> 02:19:53.980]
That's right.

[02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:55.600]
He didn't have a drinking problem.

[02:19:55.700 --> 02:19:56.440]
He had a dying problem.

[02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:57.040]
Had a liver problem.

[02:19:57.100 --> 02:19:57.500]
From drinking.

[02:19:57.780 --> 02:20:00.140]
He was good.

[02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:01.200]
Jason Robards just was.

[02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:01.420]
He was.

[02:20:01.420 --> 02:20:05.280]
And one of the movies that nobody knows about is a boy and his dog with him at Don Johnson.

[02:20:06.660 --> 02:20:07.400]
That's a great flick.

[02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:08.080]
Yes, it is.

[02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:12.280]
I mean, it's no, um, what's that one I'm supposed to like?

[02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:13.220]
Oh, there will be blood.

[02:20:13.620 --> 02:20:14.720]
There will be blood.

[02:20:17.780 --> 02:20:18.700]
Faster than a basket.

[02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:21.240]
Faster than a basket.

[02:20:22.260 --> 02:20:24.520]
He only says it about how many thousand times.

[02:20:24.900 --> 02:20:26.140]
30,000 times.

[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:27.140]
They're toward the end of the flick.

[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:29.600]
Bastion of basket.

[02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:32.600]
How could anybody like that movie?

[02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:35.180]
How could anybody forget about recommended?

[02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:36.860]
How could anybody like it?

[02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:37.420]
I don't want to say anything.

[02:20:37.460 --> 02:20:42.780]
Some people I love dearly like that movie and I just, uh, really rather not think about it.

[02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:43.620]
Based on what?

[02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:45.020]
What do they like about it?

[02:20:45.420 --> 02:20:46.780]
Daniel DeLuis' performance.

[02:20:47.160 --> 02:20:47.360]
Oh!

[02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:49.360]
They found the story to be interesting.

[02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:51.480]
Oh!

[02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:53.760]
Woo!

[02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:56.500]
It takes a little more than that for some of us.

[02:20:56.920 --> 02:20:57.340]
Yeah.

[02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:02.240]
Like entertaining and, uh, you know, a point, have it a point too.

[02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:03.700]
Having it, there is no point.

[02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:05.340]
The point is he was a bastard.

[02:21:06.460 --> 02:21:06.680]
Right.

[02:21:07.220 --> 02:21:08.960]
And the kid was bastard from a bastard.

[02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:09.940]
He wasn't his real kid.

[02:21:11.060 --> 02:21:12.580]
As if that made any difference.

[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:15.100]
Where of exploding balls?

[02:21:18.780 --> 02:21:19.200]
Absolutely.

[02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:23.280]
He's been rough on my intention that you're rating since I had an album.

[02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:27.520]
Well, I don't want to show you what a big ass said I was to your hand.

[02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:27.800]
How?

[02:21:28.460 --> 02:21:31.760]
Yet don't you get quite somebody good enough to fill my piggy pants?

[02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:33.520]
It ain't easy.

[02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:39.460]
There ain't no chance I'll ever be coming back.

[02:21:41.180 --> 02:21:43.940]
I'm excited considering a lucrative and counteract.

[02:21:45.460 --> 02:21:48.660]
If you want to know what it'll say to you if I'm shutting that transmitted to the ground.

[02:21:49.500 --> 02:21:49.920]
Why?

[02:21:50.100 --> 02:21:50.620]
That's easy.

[02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:54.040]
It's your fault.

[02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:56.520]
All you need is smoke.

[02:21:57.720 --> 02:22:01.220]
All you need is smoke.

[02:22:02.200 --> 02:22:02.940]
All you need is smoke.

[02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:06.060]
All you need is a show.

[02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:10.820]
All you need is your time.

[02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:14.760]
I mean, your own dream slots only have you today.

[02:22:15.740 --> 02:22:19.140]
You said my rating sets bottomed out in this tank.

[02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:20.840]
What's Radio?

[02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:29.080]
You have to rebub me, go up the gate and steal the woods and we get it!

[02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:33.200]
O, you need your snow, now we get it in your place

[02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:37.820]
O, you need your snow, now we get it in your place

[02:22:37.820 --> 02:22:41.740]
O, you need the snow, now we get it in your place

[02:22:41.740 --> 02:22:44.380]
My friend, I'm going to get you in your place

[02:22:44.380 --> 02:22:50.820]
I'm going to get you in my place, now we get it in your place

[02:22:51.480 --> 02:22:53.080]
Are you going to go fire me?

[02:22:53.380 --> 02:22:54.400]
Like old times

[02:22:54.400 --> 02:22:56.580]
Yeah, like old times, that's what we need in QM

[02:22:56.580 --> 02:22:58.460]
Like old times when the station had an audience

[02:22:58.460 --> 02:23:00.280]
Back when Greg Reed was at the helm

[02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:02.260]
Back when we had something going on

[02:23:02.780 --> 02:23:05.440]
Back before we had clearance in Jolly Jobelle

[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:07.920]
And Joyce destroying and butchering and raping

[02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:09.420]
And plundering and looting

[02:23:10.520 --> 02:23:11.480]
In other words

[02:23:11.480 --> 02:23:12.720]
All of these things

[02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:13.040]
Right

[02:23:14.220 --> 02:23:18.240]
Remember Dr. Rally yesterday was going to be a son of an aunt's about how he was terrified about his colonoscopy

[02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:20.940]
And I said, don't worry about an ounce of piece of cake, remember that?

[02:23:21.140 --> 02:23:21.340]
I do

[02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:24.080]
He says, you were right

[02:23:24.940 --> 02:23:26.480]
Thanks for putting my fears to rest

[02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:28.820]
You were absolutely right about the colonoscopy

[02:23:28.820 --> 02:23:32.080]
It was no big deal because they knocked me out for the entire procedure

[02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:34.940]
The worst part is going without solid food one day

[02:23:34.940 --> 02:23:37.840]
And having no food or drink until a procedure at 3pm the next day

[02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:39.640]
Man, it's good to weed again, he says

[02:23:39.640 --> 02:23:41.580]
And congrats on your upcoming anniversary

[02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:43.280]
Kind of like that's an afterthought, you know

[02:23:44.020 --> 02:23:47.640]
Like the whole world is sitting on pins and needles worrying about what a worst doctor's owl is

[02:23:47.640 --> 02:23:48.860]
About his colonoscopy

[02:23:48.860 --> 02:23:53.900]
God, I'm sure it's not the first time you had a tube up your ass or something

[02:23:54.900 --> 02:23:55.900]
Well, I'm positive

[02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:00.340]
PR Ralph says

[02:24:01.740 --> 02:24:07.140]
I was not aware and this is like, you know, like he's sitting there and all of a sudden an inspiration comes over him

[02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:09.640]
And it goes and Google something and looks it up

[02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:13.900]
I was not aware that the actor played Fredo, John Cazale, only did five movies

[02:24:13.900 --> 02:24:16.800]
They were all were not one Oscar nominations

[02:24:18.260 --> 02:24:22.060]
Then he writes, see I'm smart, not dumb like everybody says, I'm smart

[02:24:22.060 --> 02:24:24.820]
He writes, he writes

[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:28.080]
PR Ralph, you're close personal friend

[02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:31.900]
Who's got real problems

[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:38.040]
I like everybody said, like dumb, I'm smart and I want to speak

[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:38.500]
Yeah

[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:44.580]
They said there was something in it for me, I'm my own for me

[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:53.420]
That's why he joined the enemy

[02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:59.780]
Mo Green, Johnny Ola, Hyman Roth, not Mo Green, Mo Green was already

[02:24:59.780 --> 02:25:01.760]
You know I always take care of you, Fredo

[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:04.760]
What? You know I'd always take care of you, Fredo

[02:25:08.980 --> 02:25:12.720]
Here's one from your close personal buddy in partner in crime, Manny from Kendall

[02:25:13.580 --> 02:25:14.380]
Oh yeah

[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:19.980]
Armando Kanas Ferrin

[02:25:21.860 --> 02:25:27.640]
Just remember that the song promo I told you about yesterday is a song that goes back to when Stan Majors was on after you on the same station

[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:29.320]
Does anybody in the world care about this?

[02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:29.460]
No

[02:25:29.460 --> 02:25:31.140]
Is yours held on? Do you, George? No

[02:25:32.340 --> 02:25:37.940]
A local heavy metal group recorded this promo for you, I remember you had them as a guest on your show to thank them for the effort

[02:25:37.940 --> 02:25:39.020]
Do you remember that? No

[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:46.000]
The two or three minutes song basically consists of awesome guitar riffs to the occasional chorus of Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil

[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:47.080]
No other lyrics in the song

[02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:47.360]
No

[02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:51.160]
Stan Majors used to love putting that promo on his show

[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:55.680]
One time I called him and suggested we play each other's recording of the song with a ten minute difference

[02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:59.380]
The result was mind blowing all while I smoked a bowl on the ear

[02:25:59.380 --> 02:25:59.760]
No

[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:04.000]
Unfortunately I can't find my recording and you haven't played this since back in those days

[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.700]
Stan would actually play this more often than you did, we have that figure

[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:13.640]
It's the best song ever promo for your show ever made, Stan can probably tell you what song it is if nobody remembers

[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:14.260]
No

[02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:14.680]
No

[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:17.360]
I really hope you make an effort to find this last jam, Manny from Kendall

[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:17.740]
No

[02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:22.820]
We'll not make an effort to find it, we have no idea what you're talking about and I'm sure that makes all five million of us

[02:26:23.460 --> 02:26:25.520]
Nobody knows and nobody cares

[02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:31.720]
And I have a three word suggestion that will sound the problem, you know what it is?

[02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:32.100]
Get a life?

[02:26:32.460 --> 02:26:33.100]
That's it

[02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:33.420]
Wow

[02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:37.980]
Get a freaking life, get a freaking life

[02:26:39.780 --> 02:26:40.180]
God

[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:46.400]
And of course in the case of that misfit it doesn't really make any difference whether it's the real one or the you know

[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:50.520]
Let's see if we still have 65 certificates left, 58

[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:53.060]
Hey we're making a little bit of progress here, sure

[02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:55.380]
You're poo-pooing it but I'm, yeah

[02:26:56.580 --> 02:26:56.980]
What?

[02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:59.280]
I'm poo-pooing anything, yeah

[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:03.120]
You're poo-pooing, where you will be once all that food kind of settles in it

[02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:04.440]
Oh, did I eat like a pudding?

[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:05.840]
Well what did you eat beside the steak?

[02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:10.780]
First of all they had steak tips and then they brought this boneless rib-eye in that I ate half of

[02:27:10.780 --> 02:27:15.440]
And a whole bunch of wings, two kinds of chicken wings which I normally don't think goes really good

[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:16.800]
I'm not knowing I'm starving, really good

[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:17.640]
I'm starving

[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:21.380]
They had this fish dip which you know you might not like it because it's a Jewish thing

[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:24.000]
You know but what does that mean?

[02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:25.200]
That's me being funny

[02:27:25.780 --> 02:27:29.460]
It was really good, really fresh, really firm, you know, it was our business

[02:27:29.460 --> 02:27:30.940]
It wasn't going, well you don't like fish

[02:27:31.460 --> 02:27:32.760]
No I know anyway, this is good

[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:33.820]
I do like a filter fish though

[02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:38.840]
This was a nice smoked fish dip which was really fresh, really good and smoky

[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:41.560]
Oh, and they got a lot of pino peppers for it, you know

[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:46.020]
So I have to lock us in your tosses and then I had a half of a tuna wrap

[02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:46.900]
Yeah

[02:27:46.900 --> 02:27:48.180]
A tuna steak wrap

[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:50.300]
Yeah, it was great

[02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:53.500]
Sounds like damn good stuff to me but we still have

[02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:53.640]
What?

[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:55.420]
58 to go

[02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:59.740]
On Tex-Houth or Kendall and of course if we don't sell them all out we get a spanking

[02:28:03.420 --> 02:28:06.860]
Gary Sarner brings in his boyfriend and he gets to spank us

[02:28:09.780 --> 02:28:10.580]
Gary Sarner

[02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:15.900]
When you told me that story about him getting, about him leaving and then coming back in again

[02:28:15.900 --> 02:28:22.460]
I mean that old saying about having naked pictures, if you look up the saying in the Wikipedia his picture has got to be in it

[02:28:23.580 --> 02:28:27.920]
Naked pictures, fired and rehired and quit and rehired and back

[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:29.560]
And he's like part of the woodwork there

[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:34.160]
And when you move down the street is that still going on in May or whenever it's going on moving down the street?

[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:35.260]
I guess whatever

[02:28:35.260 --> 02:28:36.660]
It'll be part of the woodwork down there too

[02:28:36.660 --> 02:28:38.060]
It's like when you go to college

[02:28:39.820 --> 02:28:42.860]
And like in the, in the, what do they call it?

[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:44.300]
The eating place in the dorm

[02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:46.620]
The cafeteria?

[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:48.640]
Well I like it, they don't call it that

[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:50.080]
But well anyway whatever it is

[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:57.060]
And kids carve their name or other goofy things into the woodwork they, you know, they encourage you to do it

[02:28:57.060 --> 02:29:01.360]
They have a special wood panel place where you allow the car if you're a crappin' there

[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:04.800]
You know, NBE 1960 or whatever it was

[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:08.500]
And it's the same with Gary Sarner, whatever building this radio station will be in

[02:29:08.500 --> 02:29:09.640]
He will be there

[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:11.140]
He will be part of the building

[02:29:11.140 --> 02:29:16.460]
He's attached to it like John McCain and Julie Broomin were attached to each other at the hip

[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:23.580]
In fact when you think of, John, do you think, do you think, do you think of Gary Sarner? Sure

[02:29:24.820 --> 02:29:25.580]
Julie Broomin, do you think of Gary Sarner? Sure

[02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:27.080]
Julie Broomin, Julie Broomin

[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:29.520]
Surely you're a good friend, surely, who gave it the ticket at the track?

[02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:29.920]
Yeah

[02:29:30.500 --> 02:29:34.440]
Cracker Broomin hasn't even wider selects in old fashioned candies if you're ever driving on a highway

[02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:35.100]
She's right

[02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:37.140]
If you see a barrel cracker

[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:40.560]
I don't know where you find Cracker Broomin anymore like in malls

[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:43.520]
They were there by the highway there at like highway exits

[02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:44.620]
Not the right stops

[02:29:44.620 --> 02:29:45.520]
Like Stooky's

[02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:47.100]
No, no, no, Stooky's are at the rest stops

[02:29:47.100 --> 02:29:49.400]
Cracker barrels are like at the exit

[02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:51.220]
It's just kind of a different scene

[02:29:53.440 --> 02:29:56.260]
You know how rest stops are like in the middle of the highway there?

[02:29:56.340 --> 02:29:56.520]
Yeah

[02:29:56.520 --> 02:29:57.860]
Where the gas stations and everything are

[02:29:58.260 --> 02:30:00.280]
Stooky's are just along the sides periodically

[02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:02.620]
Like we're all the other eight men in fast food joints

[02:30:02.620 --> 02:30:02.900]
Right

[02:30:02.900 --> 02:30:04.020]
And every air sitting in the mirror

[02:30:04.020 --> 02:30:04.900]
Right, right

[02:30:04.900 --> 02:30:07.960]
See that's one thing we don't have very much of here and that really frost my ass

[02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:10.160]
Because if you're driving like on the highway here

[02:30:10.980 --> 02:30:13.800]
Like on the gardener expressway and you got to take a you know

[02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:15.780]
Acre douce or both or whatever really desperate

[02:30:15.780 --> 02:30:18.680]
There's really no place to pull off and find a fast food joint

[02:30:21.020 --> 02:30:27.540]
Whereas in the US I mean every exit you've got like signs showing you Wendy's and Mickey D's and Pizza Slut

[02:30:27.540 --> 02:30:29.900]
You know everyone's ever been invented am I right?

[02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:30.440]
Yes

[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:33.820]
Not here so I guess here you just pull off the side of the road and squat

[02:30:33.820 --> 02:30:38.300]
Holy cow, Aaron's coming well congratulations get alive

[02:30:38.920 --> 02:30:43.900]
It's another tough day on the jobs front more layoffs being announced by another company

[02:30:43.900 --> 02:30:47.480]
Let's know several major companies announced layoffs this week including Dow Chemical

[02:30:47.480 --> 02:30:53.200]
It's getting serious thousands more people losing their jobs in the weeks ahead companies announcing major layoffs and manufacturing

[02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:55.560]
Finance retail and community petions

[02:30:55.560 --> 02:30:57.220]
This is our moment

[02:30:57.860 --> 02:30:59.160]
This is our time

[02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:02.700]
Restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace

[02:31:03.820 --> 02:31:07.580]
Wonderful world but I can't feel it right now

[02:31:07.580 --> 02:31:13.920]
I don't know the answer to it well but I just want to cry now

[02:31:14.820 --> 02:31:20.280]
Well I know it's wonderful world from the sky down to the sea

[02:31:20.820 --> 02:31:23.900]
Yesterday's 60,000 jobs nationwide that were cut

[02:31:23.900 --> 02:31:29.860]
Economic forecasters say the fresh layoffs are only the beginning and they predict more significant job reductions in the next six months

[02:31:29.860 --> 02:31:32.280]
It really is grim news for the economy here

[02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:41.580]
So let us summon a new spirit of hatred isn't a responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder

[02:31:41.580 --> 02:31:44.400]
And look after not only ourselves but each other

[02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:45.980]
Yes we kick

[02:32:03.460 --> 02:32:14.580]
The road ahead will be law our climb will be steep but America I have never been more hopeful that I am tonight that we will get there

[02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:18.860]
I promise you we as a people will get there

[02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:24.320]
We the people baby 133 oh there's your president

[02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:27.180]
That's what they will be when I sign this budget in the law

[02:32:27.180 --> 02:32:34.880]
There you go he's he's taking no prisoners whatever that means that's another stupid expression you know it yeah taking no prisoners

[02:32:35.500 --> 02:32:38.780]
What the hell is that mean I changed the poll by the way that you let me go look

[02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:46.200]
923 votes on the first one what minor injuries the most painful well the new one is a Charlie B poll so don't get your hopes up too high

[02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:48.320]
It's a Charlie B poll

[02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:55.840]
It's alright in honor of Black History Month what late great black entertainer are you most sorry to no longer have around to entertain us

[02:32:55.840 --> 02:33:02.760]
And we could just say you missed the most but the Charlie B has to use a enormous amount of herbages to make it seem more pseudo intellectual

[02:33:04.340 --> 02:33:11.440]
Elephant Gerald's got a pair Ray Charles one Marvin Gaye I voted for him one when you know I'd vote for somebody with a name like gay

[02:33:12.020 --> 02:33:16.460]
Quince it what is it yeah yeah and the red fox has one

[02:33:55.780 --> 02:34:04.240]
Joe this came in yesterday Joe said punch in the balls a minor injury really yeah doesn't like require surgery stuff like that

[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:12.320]
What would you consider it a major injury that turns in how hard that punch is well that's true and depends on how soft those nuts were

[02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:19.560]
Punched in the balls for 91 paper cut 125 how about a paper cut on the nuts wow can you even imagine that

[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:20.960]
Whoa

[02:34:41.300 --> 02:34:50.440]

Oh, it's I spelled around those STY I put STYP stiptic

[02:35:27.340 --> 02:35:31.220]
TIC did you mean stiptic pencil yeah of course I'm in it you idiots

[02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:36.700]
They're trying to say like oh you're so dumb and anti-hemorrhagic

[02:35:37.580 --> 02:35:39.940]
agent a substance that promotes

[02:35:41.420 --> 02:35:42.100]
hemostasis

[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:44.640]
Stop bleeding hemostasis

[02:35:45.220 --> 02:35:52.840]
Stasis stasis stiptics are a specific type of anti-hemorrhagic agent that work by contracting the tissue to seal

[02:35:53.540 --> 02:35:54.580]
injured blood vessels

[02:35:55.220 --> 02:35:59.360]
There you go stiptic pencils also contain astringents wow

[02:36:01.460 --> 02:36:05.700]
And it goes on and our great length you could you could kill like a hundred hours a month though because yeah

[02:36:05.700 --> 02:36:09.840]
It wasn't bad enough. We did ear wax yesterday, and now we're gonna do stiptic pencils today. I don't think so

[02:36:10.940 --> 02:36:12.280]
And then of course we did my

[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:15.200]

You know, it's one thing to be the best in your craft in all time

[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:39.960]
But it's another thing to take quite the compliment to the worst ever at what you've ever done

[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:44.340]

[02:40:17.780 --> 02:40:19.120]

He's good, but he's spastic

[02:40:32.380 --> 02:40:36.880]
Every race is not the Kentucky Derby every nation is not the end of the world, you know what I mean?

[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:24.220]
We're gonna go out of business and stop with the satellite crap

[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:29.340]
Just telling the products to F offer to be liberating and think of all the it is person you can throw in

[02:42:29.340 --> 02:42:32.680]
Priceless not to mention the long way to return to the band vitzendrops

[02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:37.100]
Here's what I don't understand. I'm just down here visiting south Florida

[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:40.400]
And yet this is somebody who alleges to be an expert on the show

[02:42:40.860 --> 02:42:43.560]
With all the band vitzend you see what I'm saying. Yeah

[02:42:44.800 --> 02:42:47.020]
somewhere there's a oh, I must be my um

[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:48.400]
fungus

[02:42:50.100 --> 02:42:54.620]
And then he says I think Bobby jindals and automaton. He certainly delivers a speech like one

[02:42:54.620 --> 02:42:57.340]
PS have ever discussed the weight supplement Ali

[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:00.220]
ALLI you ever heard of it? No

[02:43:00.580 --> 02:43:02.580]
It works as advertised I've taken it for months

[02:43:02.580 --> 02:43:06.580]
But don't ever leave the house without two pants of underwear and the darkest colored pants you can find

[02:43:07.900 --> 02:43:08.260]
Ali

[02:43:09.220 --> 02:43:10.100]
Never heard of it

[02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:15.320]
Me either. You got a whole thing about weight loss. In fact, they were pitching it on the news here last night

[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:20.500]
Because you know once these things make the wear services. They all stick it on there about oh there's no difference

[02:43:20.500 --> 02:43:24.580]
It's all about calories and makes no difference what kind of diet you go on on yada yada all out of the crap

[02:43:24.580 --> 02:43:25.420]
Bull crap

[02:43:26.140 --> 02:43:27.240]
Especially if you're diabetic

[02:43:28.420 --> 02:43:33.780]
National Institute of Health pitching this crap hard healthy reduce calorie diets promote long-term weight loss

[02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:36.300]
And it says

[02:43:36.980 --> 02:43:43.100]
Hard healthy diets that reduce calorie intake regardless of differing proportions of fat protein or carbohydrate can help overweight

[02:43:43.100 --> 02:43:44.900]
No, be adults achieve a maintained weight loss

[02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:51.580]
And I'll save it for tomorrow because I know it's going to be assimilating tomorrow's going to be a big day. Georgia will be a Gulfstream

[02:43:52.580 --> 02:43:54.340]
Lots of horse racing stuff here

[02:43:55.620 --> 02:43:58.380]

I'm looking you got it. I'll add it added on there. Adalu Rawls is the greatest. I don't think he's the greatest he does deserve to be on there

[02:44:13.580 --> 02:44:18.320]
He deserves to be on our pool. Let's see 50 wants certificates. Let me check it again one more time

[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:20.020]
one more time

[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:23.160]
51 still well, it's almost half

[02:44:24.660 --> 02:44:28.740]
And most people are wishing they had half the money they used to have so I guess they might have something to do with it

[02:44:30.420 --> 02:44:35.720]
Half being the operative since my paycheck showed up yesterday half being the operative term Joe Bell

[02:44:36.260 --> 02:44:38.540]
I still I still say a lot of this is a fraudulent

[02:44:38.540 --> 02:44:45.460]
I agree a lot of grave robber ceasing the opportunity to oh the word everybody woke up one day and everybody was broke

[02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:46.820]
And everybody didn't have any money nobody

[02:44:46.820 --> 02:44:48.540]
While was buying stuff anymore

[02:44:49.660 --> 02:44:52.940]
Everybody was broke just all of a sudden out of the blue everybody had a

[02:44:53.640 --> 02:44:56.460]
toxic loan from some stupid ass bank

[02:44:57.040 --> 02:44:58.480]
Do you have any toxic loans?

[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:03.820]
Yeah, I don't got no toxic loan. I got a toxic paycheck that showed up yesterday

[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:07.140]
From a bunch of grave robbing Yahoo's

[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:10.580]
Rick says uh, then this is the same crap as yesterday

[02:45:11.260 --> 02:45:16.280]
I think what the guy's asking about is the old Zeta promo neonil. No, I played a yesterday. That's not the one he's talking about

[02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:17.600]
Rick

[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:19.340]
Get with it Rick

[02:45:20.180 --> 02:45:26.420]
And nobody cares anyway. What difference does it make right about some song that many from Kindle is made up in his mind or whatever

[02:45:26.420 --> 02:45:27.040]
Now he's doing

[02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:31.760]
Him and stand major maybe stand major is sending half of these emails for all we know

[02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:39.060]
What do you think that in a fighting media when to invite him on a show suggesting I have stand majors

[02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:43.500]
I guess we don't do guest number one and number two if we did do guess he would be one of the last people

[02:45:43.500 --> 02:45:46.640]
I mean who'd how I remember stand major anybody out there? I remember snow no

[02:45:47.660 --> 02:45:50.200]
And talk about ponderous and boring

[02:45:51.780 --> 02:45:53.340]
Unless we got him a big stoke

[02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:59.400]
You got to admit this he's still alive and he survived all those big stogies for all those years, huh?

[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:00.400]
Yeah

[02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:07.100]
Larry says yesterday you want to know why your screen bounces once in a while or shakes yeah on the albicor Express

[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:12.360]
If you have a cell phone to close too close to a PC monitor the phone radio waves it

[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:13.900]
It's got nothing to do with my cell phone

[02:46:13.900 --> 02:46:19.520]
Only if the cell phone is ringing while the cell phone wasn't ringing and the cell phone sits there next to my other thing all the day

[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:21.820]
And it doesn't have anything to do with it it might

[02:46:22.740 --> 02:46:26.420]
In my what sometimes they update it's not about whether or not it rings

[02:46:26.420 --> 02:46:30.140]
But if it says so no words but only on outlook express why would that do it?

[02:46:30.140 --> 02:46:33.720]
Do it ascended receive uh might just be a coincidence that that's what you have open

[02:46:33.720 --> 02:46:38.220]
But you don't understand when I get out of outlook express it stop shaking when I go back with shaking it well then

[02:46:38.220 --> 02:46:41.880]
It's that freaking outlook express that you talk me and do yeah

[02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:43.900]
God is that thing a piece of dreck

[02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:53.240]
Also Larry says if you have earwax just get a dropper in the shower put a couple of dots in the ear wait a minute rinse out while you are in the shower a couple of dots in the what does that mean?

[02:46:54.320 --> 02:47:01.000]
Uh drop size soon. I don't know dots. He says I think I mean he doesn't know dots from drops and I'm reading his craft Jesus God

[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:06.580]
Here's one that says I love the old-school Cuban radio station blaring into your signal could you turn up please?

[02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:11.280]

And here's another one that you're gonna have this life whatever from a chronic sour push

[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:24.980]

[02:47:32.260 --> 02:47:35.980]
Yeah exactly the pain is so great and you don't even have the fungus

[02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:41.040]
But as I look at some of these emails man, I'm convinced there is a fun US among you

[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:45.300]

[02:47:45.820 --> 02:47:47.440]
