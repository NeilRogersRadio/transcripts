[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.740]
It's hard to think see

[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.080]
If you see if we treat this sitting out in the lab, but there's a pretty good chance there

[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.800]
I got me a tumor is as big as a whale and they say that they can fix it with some stem cells

[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.240]
Right now I'm light-headed. I feel kind of funny. So hurry up and get that funding money

[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.020]

[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.440]
stem

[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.020]

[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.480]
stem cells baby

[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.040]
stem cells

[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.900]
That's where it has

[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:23.980]
Splicing and advice in packing and a wagon save them in your freezer. You can be an old geezer. My illness is tragic

[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.160]
But stem cells are magic so everybody pass them around and around and around and around

[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.220]
stem cells baby

[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.060]

[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.300]
Oh

Yeah, I agree pain

[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.940]
So today is a ratings day. This is two thirds of the winner rating book we got January and February so December January and February how did we do in December? I

[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.540]
Forget let's hope we did real bad because it's not all I think we did hope I think we did yeah

[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.620]
I'm not sure what what do you mean you think we did I think we did you don't know you're talking out your ass exactly

[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.300]
Well, I think if I program director if our program director or the the standard program director will give us the monthly is unlike a timely basis

[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.940]
We'd know where we stand

[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.500]
but we don't

[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.760]
We know where we fall

[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.740]
Today we'll find out how what's his name Bubba's doing? I don't hear nothing about him except that he's boring and Yahoo

[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.940]
I'm W.H.D.R

[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.640]
Cox broadcasting Bubba loves bunch trying to give Paul an old Ron to run for the money sure failed in that first trend last month

[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.300]
Wow, bad

[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.060]
And we'll see if Jimmy Syphilite and the band of right wing warriors over there at 610 can continue their

[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.760]
astonishing run

[00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.580]
Speaking of astonishing this email came in at 751 this morning

[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.380]
Subject fake names from John ZTR

[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.920]
This is so shocking that George is about fell off the chair I plot

[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.880]
Neil here is a list of all my fakes and I don't think he's got all of them on here because probably not well

[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:27.220]
No because he says I was all of the fake radio people mr. Radio the fake Larry King morning train a K.A. Rooster Tuchu Tom Jica Maria B and Rick Sanchez

[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.420]
He says I was all the fake radio people these took more effort because I actually had to research these in order to make it believable

[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.940]
Oh, yeah, they were very believable. I wonder if he was also Greg Budella probably and Sonny Fox and

[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.500]
Alice Rantel

[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.620]
and what which other ones and Steve Rondon Arrow on

[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.560]
Elon John ZTR you know now that you've messed up this man has no life

[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.240]
I have no life. We appreciate all the free movies by the way, but nevertheless yes

[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.480]
I mean you and the fact that he was mr. Radio

[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.500]
That goes beyond annoying that that that that's beyond above the beyond a color

[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.020]
Free it be very free. Yeah, now what's the story with the a rating is with the trend?

[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.940]
We've got it said

[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.500]
We did to get them to you as fast as I get them who did oh

[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.560]
Flea yes, oh well he's busy twittering. Hey, you're gonna drive him away

[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.960]
Then we'll have no friends in this building. I drive everybody away. I know later later

[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.320]
That's something in most cases. It's a good idea

[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.100]
I think the only reason I've survived this long is because I've driven certain people away during the course of my life

[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.980]
Holy Moses, you know what I mean? No

[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.980]
Yeah, you know exactly what I mean

[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.760]
And Bert now let's see was he also very jackass. I don't think so. I don't think he investors John ZTR has got access to all the inside

[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.320]
poop

[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.180]
That varies God. There's no way of knowing he might be a radio person. Well, I'm waiting for a follow-up from John ZTR

[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.860]
Let's find out about all the other ones because he he said I was all a fake radio people, but he's got a short list

[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:05.660]
Mr. Radio that that's just anybody that was fessed up to being the anxious obnoxious mr. Radio and a rooster choo choo

[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.780]
I told you he was rooster choo choo. He denied it. He lied about that

[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.440]
Told him because it was too much. She'll like the other crap right same old stuff

[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.780]
You do this and you do that and you're a piece of crap George is a George socks and blah blah blah. Yeah

[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:27.760]
Not that there aren't people out there who think that but I just right most people don't have the time to sit down or write that's right email after email after

[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.400]
Pandora's f-ing email

[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.180]
Same the same crap

[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.000]
Okay, so flea stuck his head in there and he said as soon as I get something that that's the way it went down last time

[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:44.600]
Well very Jackson says there seems to be some anxiety about today's trends my contacts at the ticket say howard Davis has himself

[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.000]
Barricaded in the office

[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:54.360]
Will be interesting to see how the ticket versus QM battle shapes up Joe Rose versus Sid Rosenberg's last trend

[00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:01.120]
Neil versus Sedano managed versus LeBasterd will puppet love sponge make any splash will W. I. Would you continue to dominate?

[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.980]
We're all tuned in says very jackass. We're all tuned in

[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.600]
No, he's not John ZTR and John ZTR is not yet by the way sent me any follow-up

[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.900]
Fred Souter

[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.060]
Wow

[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.340]
He's glad to be out of software

[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.840]
See they give me that song to dance. It's only you Neil everybody else loves it. It's paradise. No, it's not only me

[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.660]
So many people who got the hell out in fact even on the pool we got today. There's a whole bunch of people don't don't live there no more

[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.180]
Right we'll get to the right we'll get to it while I'm printing out Fred Souter's thing

[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:42.560]
Anyway, very writes clear channel plans to flip talk W. I. N. Z 9 40 the sports April 6th at 6 p.m. What days April 6th?

[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.560]
Monday, I thought it was Friday

[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.000]
April 6th is a Monday

[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:48.920]
well

[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.800]
The news sports outlaw will air ESPN radio's Mike and Mike in the mornings followed by Fox Sports Radio's Dan Patrick

[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.260]
Chris Myers Petros and money and JT the brick

[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.540]
Premier Radio's Jim Romal also joined a lineup Roamy. He's failed in this market a hundred times

[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.220]
Additionally, W. I. N. Z will become the flagship station for the Miami Heat and the Florida Geaters. Whoa

[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:14.340]
Miami doesn't need another sports station, but it does need a good one the best thing on one of them is Neil Rogers

[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.900]
Needs not even sports on the other hand

[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.520]
I'm not sure there is a best thing said director AM programmer church Kent Charles. They are real genius

[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:28.240]
Oh, Neil Rogers is the goal standard of talk radio. Yeah, take your goal standard and stick it up your ass can you moron?

[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.100]
940 W. I. N. Z. South Florida sports animal has the biggest names in sports radio Mike and Mike Patrick

[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:39.340]
Roamyers the Heat Gators etc go into a sports bar and say any of our show host names everyone knows them

[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:45.400]
He says oh my god open up a pot and put a bunch of cheap syndicated programming on a year 24 seven that's there

[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.480]
That's good with that great signal 940 right in the middle of the dial

[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.080]
What a disgrace his cheap channel continues destroying everything they touch there

[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.800]
He almost as bad as James crystal and Steve Lapa James crystal radio

[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.660]
I wonder if I have her own the crystal radio. I don't think so. I wish I would have had one of those

[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:10.500]
I had one of those white mics. Yeah, that was like a crystal radio was tuned to one AM frequency

[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.700]
Yeah, we still have a pink mic at the radio station. I worked that yeah

[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:22.260]
Fred Souther says the ass clouds who talk during movies should have also included concerts one of the few times

[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.900]
I go down there anymore to see shows in the amphitheater on West Palm Beach and the jackass is talking loud

[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.080]
Either on their phones or to someone sitting right next to them

[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.060]
Why the hell are they paying so damn much money for a concert ticket if it's just gonna be a social hour

[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:39.260]
Glad to be out of that damn places. I am sure you are as well as Fred amen hallelujah Fred. Yes, I am

[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:40.660]

Yes, I am and I didn't do it. I've blooded

[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.280]
So there you go April 6th Monday

[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.040]
The big flip on 940 to a bunch of syndicated talk and nobody listened to be foreign they're not gonna listen to now

[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.740]
So what's the story? It's 1010 as in 1010 wins New York. It's 1010 right where's the numbers?

[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.540]
I hear they're printing now and they're printing now which means we better do the break when we come back

[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.980]
Barry jackass is sitting right on the edge of his seat and Howard Davis has got a gun to his head

[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.900]
Neil Rogers

[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.920]
death male

[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.780]
Pull the trigger Howard

[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.540]
The public hands got their leaders

[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.860]
Southern Washington

[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.640]
What the guy in charge is a radio talker. He's a pillow pop and son of a dumb

[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.960]
Well, he big and bald as a man can come and he screams into the microphone

[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.560]
And if he says something that the G or P don't like to just leave it alone

[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.000]
That's because

[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.840]
I got to say you don't curse from a vagant name. You don't create a size George

[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:54.680]
You don't quest whether we should be tax cut and then you don't mess around with brush

[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.420]
Just send me the same thing twice you don't get married

[00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.780]
If you're gay

[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.780]
I

[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.160]
Said again

[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.780]
You don't get any credit to

[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.420]
Oh, no, I had to don't mess around with

[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:07.800]

Why are you sending me the same thing twice Monday through Sunday 6 a.m. to midnight many team plus well

[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.520]
I did on a purpose just to piss you off obviously when you it worked

[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.240]
For the week many team plus this and I was wrong by the way about December November is what dropped off

[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.180]
And I'm sure November was a bad month for us November sucked

[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.380]
Even though it should have been big because it was election month, you know and Obama and all this other stuff

[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.120]
But our people didn't give the diaries

[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:45.600]
Some of everyone's vanishing and anyway, here's what we got so far and we'd have a lot more except that you're sending me the same thing twice

[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.760]
Did I send you the same thing twice? Yes

[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.900]

Tied for 8. We had a 3.2 in the last time we had a 3.5 in this one 10 to 3

[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.980]
That means 10 to 2. We must add about a 4-year which is still nothing to write home about

[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:46.340]
It's about half what we used to do, but then again. It's the Joe Bell era W.Y.N.Z. had a 3.2

[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.500]
Where's Waxi in midday? Oh, they're not on the second page. Oh, no, keep turning pages

They're at the top of the third page though. They got a 2.0. Oh wow 2.0

[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.320]

I was 10-3.

[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:19.760]

We have a 3.0 share from 10-3 in persons 25-54.

[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.920]
That means in men we got a 6.

[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.000]
That's 10-3.

[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:36.660]
Yeah.

[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.440]
So it's 10-2.

[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.020]
Who knows? Maybe a 6-5?

[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:40.480]
Who knows?

[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:41.980]

Possible bonus money there, baby.

[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:44.700]
Who knows?

[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.560]
We get a big march.

[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.740]
Maybe even number one.

[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:47.160]
I don't know.

[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:48.940]
I don't know.

[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:49.780]
3-7.

[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.820]
Let's take a puke at it.

[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:51.880]
Or I'm first of all.

[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.700]
I haven't done any of this yet.

[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.000]
Have I?

[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.140]
25-54.

[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:54.640]
No.

[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.680]
That's the coveted demo, man.

[00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:58.280]
Oh.

[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.620]
I mean, I only estimate.

[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.380]
We can't get the exact number until they hold book comes out.

[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.780]
That's the way these crappy things are.

[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.380]
But wait till that people meter comes out.

[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.660]
We don't have anybody listening.

[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.620]
Which is certainly a possibility.

[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.920]
We got John ZTR listening.

[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.380]
He hasn't followed up by the way with any more identities.

[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.460]
I'm sure.

[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.380]
I feel really, really bummed about that.

[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.240]
Maybe he's busy.

[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:19.640]
Maybe he what?

[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.460]
Maybe he's busy.

[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:21.820]
He's busy?

[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:22.580]
Be seated.

[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:23.740]
Oh.

[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:25.980]
Okay.

[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.160]

[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.160]
Why is that?

[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.200]
Who listens to that crap?

[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.040]
I don't know.

[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:42.860]

[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:43.460]

This is person's 25-54 men and women.

[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.160]
Coast is number two with a 5.7 share.

[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.780]
Radio Amor is third.

[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.640]
CMQ FAMI.

[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:54.460]
Number four.

[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.680]
No speaking English.

[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:56.160]
A key.

[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.840]
Why 100 is fifth?

[00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.380]
WEDR.

[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.040]
Number six.

[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.400]
Radio Ritmo is seventh.

[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.580]
Life is tied for seventh with Radio Ritmo.

[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.000]
At least life plays slush in English.

[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.940]
Big is ninth.

[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.200]
This is for the whole week.

[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.840]
It's kind of, you know, meaningless.

[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.240]
Let's see where QAM and what the other one.

[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.960]
INZ's got a 1-9.

[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:18.340]
Look at that.

[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.180]
And they're dropping the format.

[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:19.820]
Oh, boy.

[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.400]
QAM a 1.7 tied for 20th up from a 1.6.

[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.620]
Oh, we're making progress.

[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.640]
Waxe a 1.4.

[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:29.600]
23rd.

[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.400]
Rhymes with third.

[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.520]
Boy, they really sucked.

[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.860]
They talk a big game like I've always said.

[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.360]
Bap, bap, bap, where that's where that is.

[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:35.880]
You suck.

[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.820]
You got a Le Bastard and he's dropping like a rock.

[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.980]
Just what we need is another sports station to divvy it up even that much further.

[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:44.240]

[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:45.640]
Mornings.

[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.240]
Persons 25 to 54.

[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.580]
Mornings 6 to 10am.

[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:49.440]
Hot 105.

[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.140]
Number one.

[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.100]
7.1 sheer.

[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.440]
Big number two.

[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.020]
Boy, they had a good book, Paul and Ron.

[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.400]
Radio one more.

[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.420]
It's third.

[00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:58.600]
Turn.

[00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.500]
Radio Ritmo.

[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.200]
Also no speaking English is fourth.

[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.520]
Boy, how do you get any diaries in the hands of people who speak English?

[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.600]
W-I-O-D dropped from 10th to 12th in the morning.

[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.420]
Persons 25 to 54 from a 3.1 to a 2.9.

[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.760]
You're slipping Jimmy Cipholitica already and when December drops off, you're going to be in the crapper.

[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.460]
You're going to be taking a big smelly, ugly dump.

[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.060]
Where are we?

[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.040]
Oh, QAM 1.3 in the last train.

[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:29.920]
1.4.

[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.860]
We went from tied for 23rd to tied for 22nd in the morning.

[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.700]
So that's about a 2.8 share in men.

[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.180]
Pretty weak.

[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.400]
Waxi.

[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.880]
Oh, wow.

[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.620]
Cip goes out with a 1.1 sheer down from a 1.3 in the previous train.

[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.280]
Tied for 24th.

[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.300]
And they only list 33 stations.

[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.420]
So what does he start here?

[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:55.100]
And guess what Mepho's got in person's 25 54 in the morning.

[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.200]
Oh, 0.3.

[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.440]
Oh, baby.

[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.960]
He likes that 0.3 sheer.

[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.240]
That's his number.

[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.180]
Mepho.

[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.160]
What happened to D-fo, Neil?

[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.520]
What happened to D-fo?

[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.360]
The Dow's up 182 points.

[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.320]
What a great day.

[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.200]
And we didn't do so bad.

[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.480]
We didn't do great, but compared to the way things have been going under the Joe Belray team,

[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.820]
and the fact nobody can hear the station, we didn't do so bad.

[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:15.400]
We'll take it.

[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:16.620]
Yeah.

[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:18.760]
I'll take it.

[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.720]
I'll take any uptick.

[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.460]
You know what I mean?

[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:21.960]
Up what?

[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:23.600]
Uptick.

[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.880]
Rhymes with 6.

[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.340]
10 to 3.

[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.480]
Person's 25 54.

[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.160]
Number 1.

[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.720]
CMQ FAMA.

[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.480]
6.5.

[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.740]
They got a whole bunch of wire diaries, believe you me.

[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:38.320]
I mean, they've always, you know, they've been doing well, but all of a sudden, a gigantic February.

[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:39.920]
How about 1-5?

[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.440]
Number 2.

[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:41.580]
Coast number 3.

[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.040]
I-o-d would drop from a 4.9 to a 4.8.

[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.140]
From 5th to 4th, though, in position.

[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:49.100]
Big?

[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.280]
Sixth?

[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:50.740]
Oh, don't tell me.

[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.460]
Oh, I'm out of paper.

[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:52.260]
One moment, please.

[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.680]
Oh, jeez.

[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.060]
Out of paper.

[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:02.540]
Okay, it's back.

[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.340]
See, I got all my school supplies there.

[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.300]
I'm all set, like Robbie Benson said, in one-on-one school supplies.

[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.780]
Oh, I got to lift that thing up, though.

[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:10.100]
Oh.

[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.240]
Lift it up.

[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:14.980]
Take it down.

[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.680]
There we go.

[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.440]
Get that.

[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.120]
Get that assembly line going again.

[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:19.800]
Ten to three.

[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:20.940]
Where did I leave off?

[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.860]
W-I-O-D is fourth with a 4.8-year.

[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.420]
Like I said, when December drops off, they're going to be really hurting for a certain.

[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.720]
Q-I-M from a 2.6 to a 3.0.

[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.180]
From 18th to time for 13th in the morning.

[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:38.300]
You're not in the midday.

[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:38.880]
Oh, that's us.

[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:39.400]
I'm sorry.

[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:39.800]

[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.460]
That's us from a 2.2 to a 2.6 to a 3.0.

[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.300]
And that's 10 to 3.

[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.340]
I don't want to like knock the big, but you know that 2 to 3 hours.

[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.340]
Oh, what?

[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:50.840]
What?

[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:51.760]
I'm sorry.

[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:52.320]
I wasn't listening.

[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:53.300]
Yeah, you were.

[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.320]
Quicky and so non-committal.

[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.040]
Quicky and such are Casper Milkley's.

[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:57.140]

[00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.760]
Doesn't matter what I think about the, uh, what happened to Waxi there in the midday.

[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.340]
We had a 3.

[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.640]
What did they highly touted?

[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.580]
I don't know what they had down here.

[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.620]
Turned in on Sadano.

[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.160]
What?

[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:07.020]
Keep turning.

[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.400]
Uh, just on the next page.

[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.000]
21.

[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:14.120]
A 1.6 from a 1.7 down to a 1.6 in midday.

[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:14.680]
Cross three.

[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.320]
We had about a, uh, well, let me give that a little bit.

[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.860]
We had about a 3.2 in men and we got a, uh, 6 something.

[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:21.200]
Right.

[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.420]
So double, double their number with their highly touted midday talent.

[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:29.040]
Oh, but that Jorge Sadano, he wants to be on a midday because he knows the expectations are low.

[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:29.740]
Well, that's good thing.

[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.180]
Expectations are low because he's a great strategy.

[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.980]
Yeah, he's meeting them nicely.

[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.320]
He doesn't have the balls to be on in the morning, you know, morning drive.

[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.740]
Person's 25 54 in the afternoon, 3 to 7 p.m.

[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.480]
Hot 105 number one with a 9.1 share.

[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.140]
Everybody in their brother between 25 and 54 is listening to Hot 105.

[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.840]
I don't think I've ever listened to Hot 105.

[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.440]
Have you?

[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:51.820]
No.

[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:53.180]
Ever.

[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:53.740]
Ever.

[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.820]
No, it ever takes sides against the family again.

[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.540]
Nix from here.

[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.300]
Ever.

[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.560]
Radio Amores number two with a 6.3 share.

[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.000]
The coast hot, well, high.

[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:03.540]
What is it?

[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.020]
How 105?

[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:04.920]
High 105.

[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.080]
High 105.

[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.480]
Radio Ritmo, boy, they got, uh, I don't know.

[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:09.640]
They're all over the place.

[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.580]
Now let's take a look in the afternoon.

[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.300]
W.I.O.D.

[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.220]
dropped from a 3.6 to a 3.3 from eight to a tie for ninth and that's the Schmidtmeister.

[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.260]
W.I.O.D.

[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.420]
Z3, 1 to a 3, 2.

[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.460]
They weren't doing all that bad.

[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.400]
And of course they're dropping it because evidently it cost a money or whatever.

[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:25.860]
I don't know.

[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.280]
W.H.D.R.

[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.720]
2.8 tied for 14th in the afternoon.

[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.100]
Nice job there, Disney.

[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.380]
Don't think about Disney.

[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.480]
His station's always suck.

[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:36.640]
Waxy.

[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:36.940]

[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:44.680]
In the afternoon, Person's 25 54 dropping from a 3 share to a 2.3 from 15 to a tie for 18.

[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.040]
Not so good, Danny Boy.

[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.700]
2.3, which means about a 4.5 in men.

[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.880]
We on the other hand, oh my god.

[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:53.560]
Whoa.

[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.020]
But we did go up.

[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.340]
We went from a 1.1 to a 1.1.

[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.300]
That means about a 2.2 in men, 25 54.

[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.200]
Oh, poor Mr. Mad Dog.

[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.300]
Of course that's 3.4 hour must have really helped.

[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.300]
Um, what else am I looking for?

[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.780]
W.F.T.L. had a 0.4.

[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:16.040]
That Steve Lafferman, him and James Crystal radio, they make a big impact.

[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.360]
Wherever they go, whatever they touch turns to instant processed duty.

[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:20.920]
7 to midnight.

[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.440]
25 54 poisons.

[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.180]
Coast is number 1 with 8.1.

[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.600]
What does that tell you about the market?

[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.460]
That's a coast is number 1 at night.

[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:29.640]
Lane.

[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.140]
Radio Almor is number 2 with a 7.3.

[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.140]
They went way up.

[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.260]
Everybody loves Luis Miguel now, I guess.

[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.680]
And Gloria Estefan, that bitch.

[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.560]
W.I.N.Z. at night, 2.3.

[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.500]
I.O.D. down from a 2.9 to a 2.7.

[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.420]
I'm just just reading random numbers.

[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.760]
Waxi 7 to midnight, 0.8 to a 1.5.

[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:51.500]
It's the Panthers.

[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.860]
We love the Panthers.

[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:53.800]
They win a lot.

[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:54.740]
They got a shot.

[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:56.520]
Panthers got a shot.

[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.320]
If they don't make the playoffs, they should be.

[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.020]
Leafs of one last night, he filled off you 3 to 2 right in the air Canada center.

[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.020]
Aren't you excited about that?

[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:06.400]
Meal.

[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:06.740]
That was game.

[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:07.760]
Meaningless.

[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.540]
All the games released for your meaningless W.F.T.L. at night had a 0.6.

[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.600]
You might laugh at that, but wait till you see what we had.

[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.020]
Whoa!

[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.500]
Here is the number of the century.

[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:20.780]
Oh.

[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:22.760]
So you get a girl?

[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:23.960]
Golly Miss Molly.

[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.860]
7 to midnight, person's 25 54.

[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:35.520]
We went from a 0.6 in the fall to a 0.5 in the next round to a 0.3 in this round.

[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.240]
0.3.

[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.900]
I say shut the damn thing down at 7.

[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:44.660]
Wow.

[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:46.520]
Wow.

[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.000]
In your life, have you ever been on a radio station that generated that kind of number?

[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:50.700]

[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:50.920]
No.

[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.500]
Me either, but of course, you've been in the business a lot longer.

[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:54.720]
No.

[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:55.820]
Not even close.

[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.240]
Of course, remember that one time we had that one hour where we hit a 0.0.

[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:03.580]
Yeah.

[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:04.640]
Not easy to do that.

[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.220]
Well, I'm telling you, I think all the way around we did not great on the station,

[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.900]
but we did fairly decent real ticket, a little bit of a comeback,

[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.380]
considering the signal is so bad.

[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.760]
And across the street they suck big time, which is all these people care about.

[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.220]
It's not so important that we do great, but that they fail badly.

[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:21.680]
And they did.

[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:27.080]
They stunk and said the kid went out left a trail of dung behind him.

[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:27.420]
Wow.

[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.280]
Dung, dung, dung.

[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.480]
Left a big smelly pile of dung in his wake.

[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.160]
Hi, this is G Gordon Lydia and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.

[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.400]
Hey, y'all, it's Britney again on my blog.

[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:44.500]
Well, I'm still on the road and I'll head down with some.

[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.460]
Honey, I got your grits, Kevin called and you're f***ing hanging out.

[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.020]
Okay?

[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.080]
Dung it.

[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.580]
I can't believe it.

[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.580]
I have to call Kevin back.

[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.460]
Anyways, the last city we went to, we...

[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:58.520]
Excuse me, Britney.

[00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.940]
Go ahead, Tyrone.

[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.280]
Oh, he's on my security detail, y'all.

[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.500]
There's cameras everywhere and he watches everything.

[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:07.820]
It's great.

[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.660]
You have a visitor at the gate and you f***ing hanging out.

[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.720]
Oh, M.G.

[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:13.460]
Someone's at the gate.

[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.140]
Oh, head, London.

[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.400]
What's that?

[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.140]
Sean Preston's bail in a well?

[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.120]
Oh, my f***ing hanging out.

[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.440]
Let me stuff it back in.

[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:27.680]
Thanks, London.

[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.000]
This is what could have been really embarrassing.

[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:31.940]
TTFM, go!

[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.300]
Thousands have 222 points.

[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.460]
Oh, yeah, wow.

[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:40.040]
Paul says we have two 50,000-mile sports stays in here in Chicago.

[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:45.260]
We'll never listen to them, but we've managed to re-broodcast five, 60-year-round the house on FM99.1, Neil God.

[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:46.240]
Says Paul in Chicago.

[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.220]
Oh, thank you, Paul.

[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.080]
Arrest.

[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.780]
Wish we could be on FM in somewhere.

[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:50.420]
Anyway.

[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:50.880]
Anything happy, Gray?

[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:51.540]
Sure would be.

[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:58.020]
Okay, so somebody says is it possible to compute the 0.3 to an actual number of people?

[00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.960]
Yes, it is, as a matter of fact, right here.

[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:06.580]
Seven of midnight, persons 25, 54, and by the way, WQM is tied for 29th.

[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.000]
There are only two other stations worse.

[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:17.180]
WNMA got a 0.2, and WFV has got a 0, and there's got a 0.

[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:17.880]
They don't show it all.

[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:18.560]
Radio Faye.

[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.760]
Radio Faye.

[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.100]
0.3, you know how many people average quarter hour that is?

[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:24.620]
300.

[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:26.700]
Wow.

[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.040]
Wow.

[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.920]
We're tied, by the way, for 29th with WNBM, Haitian melodies, who also have 300 average quarter hours.

[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.980]
Oh, my God.

[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.260]
Oh, my God.

[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:39.940]
Wow.

[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.600]
What are we going to do about that?

[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.600]
Of course, that's a Jolly Jo's buddy, DA.

[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.460]
All the Jolly Jo buddies, man, they really do a job for us.

[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:52.200]
They really do.

[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.220]
Of course, that night time, certainly.

[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:57.820]
And of course, following that 7-8 hour, I think there's a minus in front of that number.

[00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:58.580]
7-8 hour.

[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.220]
That dolphin tonight thing.

[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:04.520]
That infomercial that we sold our sold away and for to get to dolphin broadcasts.

[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:05.220]
Yeah.

[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:06.820]
So, oh, and here you go.

[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.500]
John Z. T. R. Toria.

[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.260]
See, don't send us an incomplete list.

[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.380]
He says, yep, I'm Jimmy Cephalo.

[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.340]
So, he's Jimmy Cephalo's.

[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.140]
As I suspected, the fake Jimmy...

[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.800]
Wouldn't be something if he was to fake everybody.

[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:24.960]
We'll never know.

[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.180]
We'll know if he keeps sending in the things.

[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.860]
I embarrassed him into that one to fake Jimmy Cephalo's.

[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.960]
Talk about, I have no life.

[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:34.760]
I have no life.

[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.840]
Oh, my God.

[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:36.640]
All we know is something.

[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.760]
Keep it coming, Z. T. R.

[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:38.280]
Right.

[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.080]
Because he has sent a lot of good material.

[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.440]
Not as good as this one from the real Josh Cortes.

[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.900]
Congratulations on the good trend numbers.

[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:47.780]
I knew I would be...

[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:48.160]
You'd be...

[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.020]
Proving right when I told you to stop taking calls and move over to taking emails.

[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.060]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.540]
Now that you're in a good mood and feeling better, can you get my check in the mail?

[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:57.520]
It's almost a weekend.

[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.820]
I'll need the cash to get drunk while I'm cruising A1A.

[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.700]
Yeah, this weekend I'll make an attempt.

[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:07.040]
And of course, Fat Chris, he hasn't got a check yet, but he's only been doing it a couple of months.

[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:08.340]
You know, what's the hurry?

[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.500]
He's doing a fine job, by the way.

[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:10.880]
Good.

[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.600]
Do you see him at all, Fat Chris?

[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:13.300]
No.

[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:14.400]
No?

[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.400]
I don't.

[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.680]
Then hang around to...

[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.200]
Shoes?

[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:18.680]
No.

[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.640]
You know, he lives down there and yet he's about, so...

[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.160]
Oh, that's true.

[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.260]
Takes him a long time to get home.

[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:23.580]
That's right.

[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.440]
Buzz Burbank with more on this, this is also good.

[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:32.240]
Now that we know the identity of Mr. Radio, it's somewhat taken the bloom off the rose,

[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.480]
but nevertheless, subject, twittering tweets.

[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.680]
I think it's safe to say we have clearly identified the known...

[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.340]
...knowns, the things that we know that we know.

[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.940]
I think with great confidence, the same can be said for the known unknowns, the things we know we don't know.

[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:52.740]
It's the unknown unknowns, that is, to say the things we do not know we don't know, that have me the most worried.

[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:58.040]
A new player has popped up on the horizon, Mr. BVB-A-K-A-Beren van Bunghol.

[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:03.180]
There is very little note about him, but would appear that he and Mr. Radio 610 are quite cozy,

[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.740]
twittering and tweeting daily.

[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.060]
Neo, we need to be precise, we can't afford lack of precision with such a small margin of error.

[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.980]
Please continue to follow your instincts.

[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.660]
Remember success depends on the ability to carry it off.

[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.460]
I will stay in touch and you know how to reach me if needed, warmest regards, Buzz Burbank.

[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.800]
Subject, twittering, tweets.

[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.180]
This also must be John.

[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:23.060]
Sure.

[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:24.620]
ZTR, huh? You think?

[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.640]
Either hand more someone just like him.

[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.760]
Someone just like him, you mean there's another, there's a clone?

[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.920]
There's always more than one.

[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.980]
Oh, not like John's ETR.

[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.780]
Maybe not just like him, but...

[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.120]
Not like Rooster Choo Choo.

[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:44.860]
Oh, very jackass.

[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.220]
Didn't I give enough numbers? I thought he said.

[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:51.560]
He said, you said Paul and Rob were number one and men 18 plus with a six-year and Bubba had a 2-2.

[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.240]
That's right. How did Bubba do against Ron and Paul in person's 2554?

[00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:01.200]
Okay, I'll finish his email log at the person's 2554, 60 to 10 a.m.

[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.320]
Okay? You ready?

[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.060]
I'm ready.

[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:08.380]
Big was number two, a big increase with a 5.8 up from a 4.7.

[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.280]
And what's the other colors?

[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.360]
The W-H-D-R?

[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.700]
I mean, who can keep track?

[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.840]
They keep changing all these crawled colors and flow HDR from a 1.5 to a 2.1.

[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.300]
So they had a 5.8 and he was 18th up from 22nd.

[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:31.880]
From a 1.5 to a 2.1. So he went up some, but the fact that they went up so much means he sure ain't doing nothing to them.

[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:32.820]
No.

[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.140]
It says, their channel seems to be making a huge mistake flipping W-Y and C either getting very decent ratings.

[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.560]
They beat the ticket every major day part in many 18 plus.

[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.180]
We're very competitive with Q-A-M.

[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.780]
Now they're going to be competing for fractions.

[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.440]
That's right. But look at all the money they're going to save, Barry.

[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.620]
Hey, Barry, you're fair.

[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.060]
Right. Couldn't have said it better myself.

[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:54.080]
So, cheap channel competing for fractions. That's what they specialize in.

[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.620]
That's what they're programming is all about.

[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.840]
A sliver of a slice of the pizza, like Mo Wudsay, a sliver of a slice.

[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:02.680]
Oh, for me.

[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.160]
The pizza.

[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:14.260]
So John ZTR is Mr. Radio Larry King, Chuchu, Rooster Chuchu morning train, Tom Jekker, Maria B, Rick Sanchez, and Jimmy Cifalitic.

[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.800]
Oh, and I try to tell you all these emails are fake.

[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.820]
Oh, no, it's all in the real piece. I'm naive. I'm just a punk.

[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.480]
They want for me. The thousand of 223.

[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.260]
Neil at NearRageers.com. Now that we gave all those numbers out,

[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.960]
where's all the, you know, response. And of course,

[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.900]
there would be response from real people if they emailed us, but they don't.

[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.940]
It's all John ZTR.

[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.800]
So he needs to get into a character.

[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.760]
Now, what is this?

[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:41.600]
What?

[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:45.480]
Oh, yeah. Jim Young.

[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.600]
I think it's funny that whenever someone other than you does, well, they had wired diaries,

[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.440]
but when you do, well, it's never the case. Good stuff.

[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:53.340]
I've never said that we don't get wired diaries. We're hoping for wired diaries.

[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:53.700]
That's right.

[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.560]
That's when you have a really wild month is when you get a whole bunch of wired diaries.

[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.460]
All your fans get the diaries and they put down, diddo, diddo, diddo. Of course.

[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:02.420]
I'm wired.

[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:03.760]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:09.200]
Jim. And how did this come through on my real email? That's what I'd like to know.

[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.220]
Let me go to it.

[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.820]
It just came through on my crackberry.

[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.540]
How do you like that? So Jim Young must be a Joe Bell.

[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.220]
Jim Young.

[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.160]
Friend of yours.

[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:30.540]
I don't know who that is and where the hell to get my email. Probably got it from Joe Bell or it is Joe Bell.

[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.740]
Or somebody who used to work here.

[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.220]
Who knew your real email. Who used to email you all the time.

[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.380]
And who would that be?

[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:38.500]
Fat boy.

[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.520]
Oh, fat boy. Yeah, that could be it.

[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:45.220]
Or is buddy.

[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.940]
Oh, very macocknus is John's ETR is not the real very macockner. Love you to sign very macockner.

[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.660]
Well, that's good. Isn't that comforting to know? Oh, yeah.

[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.560]
Okay. Just checking to see if there's anything worthwhile on me. There's not.

[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:11.780]
I had my hopes up. I thought that once we gave these numbers out there because Barry Jack said everybody's on pins and needles, all markets in an upper or about this trend.

[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.160]
And I gave him out.

[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:21.160]
Seems like we did better than we expected. We did okay. Not so bad. Now what in March, we need a bunch of wired diaries.

[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:28.820]
Yeah, when we do well, it's all legit. When everybody else does well, it's not. That's right. That's him.

[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:36.320]
You're right. It's a fat boy or is or is boyfriend one of the. A lot of guy a lot of a chronic with a lot of boyfriends. You know what I'm saying?

[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.340]
Yep, not a coincidence.

[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:45.900]
Oh, Neil at neorages.com. We got the Neil deal coming up at noon today and hour and six minutes away.

[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:53.120]
And when am I going to get the stuff for Gulfstream tomorrow? You might have we might want to lean on Steve. What's his name? Slow and for that little bit. I'll go lean on it.

[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.660]
I don't have nothing from Steve's phone for sure. Second race tomorrow.

[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:03.700]
At Gulfstream. I still am pissed off about that one with the disarmament last Friday. That was awful.

[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:11.820]
I've seen horses quit, but I mean, it was just like somebody slammed on the brakes. Like he had hydraulic brakes just slammed those babies on.

[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:20.660]
And the rest of the field went smoking on by and he just was backing up. I mean, my mother used to complain about being backed up, but that was just ridiculous.

[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:28.820]
Scott says moving out of South. Oh, that's right. We haven't even got to the poll yet. On our gone by all these ratings,

[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:33.580]
not as other chaserae and all that important crap from John's ETR. We haven't even gotten to the poll yet.

[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:39.900]
So let's do the break and then we'll get to the poll. But we're mailing in a bunch of numbers today. The poll numbers, the rating numbers.

[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:49.460]
Everybody likes a good number. Believe you me. Oh, and thanks to John's ETR for all those movies. By the way, including the South Park episode that I'm going to watch tonight.

[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:55.020]
I sent you that one. I burned that for you. Oh, did you? Well, I can say thanks to George for you. But the other stuff. Thanks, little George.

[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:01.900]
You're welcome. You're not too excited about the fact that there's possible. Again, I don't want to see me. I'm doing cartwheels.

[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:10.160]
Possibly waiting's bonus money in another month when a whole book comes out. I've already cranked out three batches. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm so excited.

[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:20.300]
Can I just say thank goodness for the new Quiznos delivery? Can I say that? I just did.

[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:26.100]
This is the Neoroncher shell. This is your brain.

[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:29.040]
And question.

[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:07.960]
Here's a great email. I missed the beginning of the show. Can you recap the ratings next hour just how the QM hosted thanks Matt. Yeah, I'm going to read the whole show for you Matt.

[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:24.700]
Get out of here. You believe that? No, I don't believe it. He can. Don't miss the beginning of the show on a ratings days. Come out, Matt. You idiot. You silly person. You fairy. I'll think about it. You just listen to the archives tomorrow. Now. Now. Now. Let me ask you something. Wasn't yesterday April Fool's Day not today. Correct.

[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:36.200]
Okay. Well, we've been had. By a real jerk. John's ETR. He says Neil, I didn't think you were so gullible. Happy April Fool's. I'm none of those people that I wrote before.

[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:47.600]
I was hoping that by claiming to be them, it would force them to come out of the closet and admit their true identity. Anyway, please don't read this on the year if you think there's any chance of the real Mr Radio coming out.

[00:44:49.540 --> 00:45:01.600]
He just he just playing with us like on a yo yo, you know. Yeah. And right on the heels of that, I get these. Tom Jicca, the fake Tom Jicca. John's ETR is a liar.

[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:11.580]
If he's lying about being me, who else is he pretending to be? Ask the other emailers to come up with code words that'll expose John's ETR as the fake. He is. My code word is blank.

[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:30.280]
Ask John's ETR to come up with that. Sign the real fake Tom Jicca and is if that isn't enough. Maria Jimmy Cifilis Jimmy Cifilitic W. I. O. D. had another great trend. I had a six in men 25 54 and a 4.5 in men 18 plus.

[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:39.100]
Rush had a 10 share in men 25 54. You had a six. PS. I'm not John's ETR's in a posture and Maria Barclay Romo says, hello, sir.

[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:46.080]
I'm tuning in this morning. I can confirm this John's ETR character is not me. I'm in makeup getting ready to do a live segment in front of the G 20.

[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:56.000]
Have you checked the markets today at 200 plus point gain 236 to be exact. You know, if you took your wood by money from yesterday and purchased Dow futures yesterday to be up real big today,

[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:25.980]
sir, it's not too late to diversify regards Maria B. So what do you think? What do you believe? I think that it's all a crock of crap. I think it's all a bunch of crazies. One or several. What? Why are you so sour, man? It's all a crock of crap. Well, of course it's a crock of crap. Well, just like the colors are a crock. That's right. That's the same group. If they're not, if they're a chronic on the phone, they're not the same group. It's a different. You think that I'm your friend has got the other. No. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I

[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:51.520]
'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. But the old one. And yeah, by the way, you think I run you. You think that he's got the, there are homeless crazy people on the library computers every day. All the Returns. I see. Ask any librarian. Christine. Says. You should be taking cause. The would help the ratings. You old. Well, guess what? Since I stopped taking the calls every month. The ratings keep going up. We're making a come back. And then once we get the signal fixed, then you'll see.

[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:57.380]
Then they will fear us once somebody can hear the station. I mean a 0.3 at night on this radio station

[00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.840]
Who could believe that?

[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.960]
Huh seeing is believing I

[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.060]

[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.540]
W. I. Z was announcing they were changing formats this Friday yesterday

[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:22.960]
Which was April fools day and by the way they presented the announcement it seemed to be a gag love you Neil

[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.680]
Says Robert it's not a gag Robert

[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:31.740]
It's everywhere they're changing they they if they got the lineup on there with all the sports nerds are gonna have on

[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:38.600]
Why would anybody doubt it especially since cheap channel is a doing the same thing in several other markets because it's radio on the cheap

[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:43.380]
They don't call them cheap channel because they're real broadcasters or because they spend any money

[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:46.300]
But Ken Charles really wants you Neil. Oh, yeah

[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.740]
If I'd pay them to work there, I think they might put me on here

[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:51.240]

[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:21.100]
nothing

[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:23.740]
Yeah

[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:30.020]
Do it nothing. Why do you know he's busy now? He's busy. He's probably out waiting plans. He's got to make and all that stuff

[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:38.140]
You know he he asked the you know, and she said yes to the idea to the other crap. Well, she's gonna be really sorry

[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:44.060]
That is gonna be a marriage. I mean, I wish him all the best, but I just smell it's gonna be a marriage from hell

[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.880]
Her being whoever she is married to that

[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:52.580]
Can you even begin to imagine can you imagine waking up next to him in the morning?

[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.080]
Why are you doing that to me? I can't either

[00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:00.640]
Got lunch commons in for Christ. Thanks. Oh, that's right. Sorry. There's Gordon Brown

[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:05.640]
Eva of international cooperation. What do you think about the Obama's in the Queen?

[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:06.900]
Wasn't that

[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:09.960]
All those other stodgy. Oh

[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:15.020]
I wonder if Obama asked her if he had a good VM in the last 10 years bitch. That would have been good

[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:20.980]
I would have given him a sitting ovation if he would have had the nerve to say that to the Queen the Queen

[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:25.200]
Let's have a spot of tea and talk about the world affairs

[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:31.320]
Branden says I know you didn't see it, but please watch South Park this week. You love it for sure

[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.920]
He's talking about the one that was last night I guess

[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:40.520]
Yeah, it was hysterical it almost killed me really. Oh, yeah, I got to watch the one with the Jonas brothers

[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:45.280]
That's more point. That's right. It's what more important. You'll get a bigger kick out of that

[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:49.700]
Oh, let me take all these ratings put them over there over there put them away

[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.040]
Oh, sorry, man. I'm not gonna read them again

[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:58.040]
We had a little improvement in the morning a little improvement in a midday afternoon was a

[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:04.980]
disaster a 1.1 in person's 25 54 a 1 and at night a 0.3

[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.160]
whoa

[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:13.220]
And the labaster went down quite a bit too. He is the the bloom is off of that turd

[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:22.440]
He had that one really talk about wire diaries and one really fluke month their last month and now it's back back to where you know has been

[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.180]
You know what I mean by has been like Sid Rosenberg said the kid

[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:32.700]
Left out with one shares in the morning. Oh talk about laying a big gigantic a talk to big game

[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:38.240]
Oh, I'm the best and I'm the best and blah blah. Yeah, that's it. So what everybody tells me always telling everybody how great he was

[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.460]
I guess they didn't believe him

[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:41.400]
You think

[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:47.340]
Must be I guess his credibility on a scale of oh is a minus

[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:50.800]
Not good when your numbers start with a minus in front

[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:07.160]
I'll have five pizza burger combos with a super sized dire coke and fries a new contract with a two-year extension and a

[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:07.940]
Pleasant's epile

[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:12.500]
And a well-eat paperback of a griveness

[00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:15.600]
Gallon up a stashio mid-dice cream

[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:23.280]
industrial size box of cord flakes a one-month membership the blue boy online and a quarter some young guy

[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:25.480]
Yeah, a

[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:33.000]
Quigal sandwich on pump or nickel line flavored grisco fluffy a box of tripe tenders 10 nearly burgers

[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:39.520]
Bromo self-ser and pocket full of miracle for now. Yeah

[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:44.780]
So any new like you still there with these contract negotiation underway. I should bring your attention

[00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:50.600]
Hey, it wouldn't have been a deal. Hold on. Yeah, excuse me. You say trace

[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:55.700]
I said try not to trace try tender

[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:00.740]
Oh, I think you're still have the free baseball cards as a family lead

[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:05.160]
Oh

[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.720]
The douse up turn 67 point. Let's hear it

[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:15.180]
Norma can't among the missing I wonder he's MIA. I wonder if he's still alive. You think she's still alive. Yes, you do yeah

[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:20.320]
Here's somebody with a phone number who says you should buy a radio station and hire your own home

[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:25.460]
Mike and Hollywood sorry, Mike hire your own host even George could have a show then you could have a 7.6 year

[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:30.100]
Right buy your own radio if I had money to buy a radio station. Why not what I keep working Mike?

[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:35.720]
Years and years and years. Oh, need you should buy your own radio station. How many of those have we had?

[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:38.220]
Five million. Yeah, at least

[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:40.340]
and

[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:43.000]
I got one from the real

[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:49.380]
Eradman I like that all right. I think he's the only real person on the emails. It could very well be

[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:54.860]
Subject bomb decay. He hired me a WQM after I got screwed by Gary Bruce's for last man

[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:59.780]
A lot of people got screwed by Gary Bruce really

[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:05.300]
I'm sure that he lived right down the street for me boy. That was a shock when I found that out

[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:10.340]
Remember that yep came knocking on my door one day on the weekend came knocking on my door I

[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:13.320]
Forget what that was all about

[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:15.140]
Boy

[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.340]
And I made the mistake of inviting him in for a couple minutes

[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:27.180]
Here's one that says good morning the old from blacky. I don't understand the reason why your listeners have to use a fake email address

[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:31.480]
Have you ever had the cheese steaks at Sunnies on taft and 66th Avenue in Hollywood? No, I've not

[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:37.640]
Next time you're in South Florida stop by you will not be disappointed says blacky who either owns it or works there

[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.640]
Has got something to do with it. I think

[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:46.420]
Oh here you go Larry King says I believe John's ETR is buzz Burbank

[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:52.800]
But I don't believe is the real mr. Radio fake Tom jica or the fake Maria Bartiromo my code loan me $50

[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:58.140]
And then it's got a whole bio here of buzz Burbank. Oh

[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:02.440]
The stuff that you people send if they if the audience just had any idea

[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.520]
They had any clue

[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:11.360]
They would just plots they would pull over to the side of the road if they're driving and just puke their hang their head out the window and puke

[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.800]
Their guts out hang down your head Tom duly

[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:20.460]
Here's one from Osvaldo Valdas. I wonder if he's related to as valdo formula who?

[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.780]
Osvaldo formula harness driver from Italy. Oh

[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:25.240]
harness guy

[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:30.380]
Trot guy. I don't know if he's still alive or not. I bet you Enrico Belay is still alive

[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.820]
High Neil I was declared dead in Paris, France July 3rd 1971

[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:39.320]
But really retired and moved to a secret location near Las Cruces, New Mexico

[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:45.720]
I've been a lawyer listener of your program. I listened online for the past 36 years in honor of your recent anniversary

[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:50.560]
I decided to change lyrics to one of my more popular songs here it goes sung to writers on the storm and

[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:57.620]
Then it goes on with a bunch of crap pretty weak weak. Oh, and guess who else just chimed in speaking of fakes

[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:00.020]
Armando

[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:02.640]
Connisfarin, okay

[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:09.540]
Just wanted to show you a scan of my mint condition mount Neil T-shirt just scrolled out a bit to see it

[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:12.280]
PS John's ETR does not speak from a screw him

[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:18.180]
Mani from a Capulco not to be confused with mani from Kendall and the audience of course is probably wondering who they are all these people

[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:24.000]
All I know is that since I stopped taking the calls my life has improved a million percent and the ratings keep going up every month

[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:31.080]
And we actually have a shot of bonus money. Oh, no, Neil the audience wants to hear. I'm your friend. I don't I don't

[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:37.920]
There are no calls. I know you disagree with that when you're on you do whatever to have you please can't

[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:45.080]
Just keep going for four hours. That's all I ask get the spots on we got 40 minutes until the Neil deal today can't wait

[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:48.840]
Yeah, no, you can't wait for the free food to come in. That's what you can't wait

[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:53.700]
Don't give me a song. It's about you can't wait for the Neil deal to start. No, that's what I was talking about the food

[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:55.540]
Yeah, for the food right

[00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:01.020]
What a scam you got going there and you're whining about a car. I want it

[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:05.700]
Yeah, I'm wanted about you are now. What are you whining about nothing? Well good?

[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:09.220]
I'm not whining about anything either. I feel a little bit better. I did not grade

[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.320]
Not great and you want to know why why?

[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.980]
Because it's stuffy in here. I got to crack open some windows

[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:20.100]
You know what's gonna be 58 to be here today

[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:27.020]
It's already 52 and they're saying 14 which is 58 degrees. You know what that sounds like a real good day for

[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:28.780]
Woodbite. Yeah

[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:36.240]
Oh, I don't understand how a man like you can sit in front of a slot machine. Well, I do I like it

[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.620]
I'm an old fart and I like it. I enjoy it old ladies

[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:45.740]
Fags where the ones that go to a casinos we keep the economy going wherever we are

[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:56.460]
Find a good machine mom. What day is it Thursday? Yep, it's gonna be real quiet around a Thursday. You want to know why what they do people get paid most of them

[00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:57.600]
Friday right

[00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.860]
I Thursday they're all broke all the plungers are broke

[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.480]
So Thursday's usually a pretty good day to go because it's really empty. It's quiet

[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.600]
Then on Friday they all bring their pay envelopes

[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:16.020]
It's a true story and I know it's hard for you to envision. Oh, I bring their pay envelopes

[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:21.460]
They keep reaching in pull out another 20 another 20 and then guess what oh the rain on the left. Oh, she's got a way till nice

[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:22.360]
Friday. Good paid again

[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:28.800]
Or let me go to the ATM and get a couple hundred and I can triple it

[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:35.020]
The thousand seventy three points god am I excited see one thing about John's ETR. He has no credibility anymore

[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:40.940]
We don't know whether to believe the first email or the next one or the fact maybe he sent all those other ones who the hell knows

[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.180]
Neil said to report that while listening to mad dog the other day he said he plans to retire after his contract

[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.620]
Runs out wants to spend more time in the keys at Ziggy and mad dogs

[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:59.160]
What management is done with that showing the afternoon drive is almost as criminal as what it's done to the near Roger show

[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:05.820]
Maybe Jackson Defoe replaced mad dog in afternoon drive. See ya says see ya. Oh, this is an idiot chef Sparky. He's a moron

[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:10.780]
Uh-huh

[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:18.460]
This is great. It's from sarcastic Sam

[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.440]
See I love stuff like this especially if it's from different people which probably is not I

[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:27.080]
Try to go with the flow, you know you flow it

[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:33.980]
Here's one that says agree the current team for the dolphins is so bad actually Moe was pretty good

[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:37.280]
He was clear and understandable. This is just a bunch of gobble to go

[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.620]
Says 60 minutes. I should have cut them a wild back now. They're done on my list

[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:49.140]
They use the word bling to describe something they to have given it to the failure of mastering the English language

[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:55.120]
Which was formed by MTV exposure to little kids and it's filtered up to the rest of society. Yeah, I think I saw that

[01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:57.600]
Oh, here's the a fake Greg Budell

[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.880]
I'm hearing that Bob McHale returned to Miami to be PV of WQAM

[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:06.700]
This gives credence to the rumors QAM is going to oldie sports hybrid. I'll meet with Joe Bell next week when I'm in town Greg

[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.780]
Yeah, we're going to all these oh

[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:10.180]
Oh

[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:16.240]
Blackie says no need. I don't work their own a place even though this area of Hollywood was referred to as the armpit

[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.580]
Don't let that scurry of the hoodies are excellent. Well good. I'll take your word for it

[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:21.940]
Oh

[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:26.140]
You know where the armpit of Hollywood is have you smelled it? No

[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:30.320]
Next time you go home just sniffle maybe you'll find it

[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:36.900]
Maybe blackie will do right you'll give you directions. Okay, so our cast is saying from Boston says I

[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:42.860]
Know you don't need any additional valuation at law and callers specifically chronic on ears has it is to one health

[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.900]
But I now have medical evidence from a real doctor to prove this is the case

[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:51.540]
I've been listening to you since the mid 1980s and even though we are currently rid of the chronic stank's neal god

[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:54.680]
I think all the years of hearing them beforehand is done permanent damage to me

[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.560]
At a recent visit to my doctor he took a look at my blood profile

[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.540]
He said my billy Ruben level was high, but the rest of my liver related readings were normal

[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:05.940]
There was no need for alarm because he said it wasn't serious now

[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:10.460]
Here's the scary part the doctor said there's a medical term for my condition. It's called Gilbert syndrome

[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.940]
I was too much in track to ask whether I could

[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:20.220]
Soon develop a mild speech impediment have the uncontrolled but urs are constantly call every talk radio station in the free world

[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.580]
Below is some info on Gilbert syndrome

[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.360]
Yadayana, okay

[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.720]
Nice try Sam from Boston very weak

[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.400]
Then that's had it was good. Yeah, well, I'll say I'm saving that for later

[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:36.700]
A lot saving what that email I'll offer that later. I might need a good laugh later on

[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:43.100]
Yeah, well they try hard, you know, but there's nobody like John ZTR nobody can match him

[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:48.040]
As far as the cervic what as far as we know for is a cervic horse grab

[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:53.880]
I mean once he morphed into Rooster Chuchu, which I don't know if he was that one or not

[01:03:55.460 --> 01:04:00.720]
Pierce is I'm gonna be in Paris April 21st of 29th when you like me to bring you anything back since Peter

[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:03.640]
Well, what kind of a stupid email is that?

[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:05.120]
Has for something

With the U.S. President on her arm the much anticipated moment her greeting with the Queen

Her majesty extends her hand and Michelle accepts it

[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:57.860]
It wasn't the curtsy that made Brits wild over France's first lady

[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:04.520]
But it did please the Queen and calm the nerves from earlier in the day. I'm very much forward looking forward to meeting her

[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:08.680]
for the first time. Oh, wouldn't be the first Queen. He's meant I'll guarantee you that

Kevin says, hey Neil much like when your station had the marlins across the street

[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:03.420]
Everyone's trying hard to destroy the one show with any slight success with Le Bastard

[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:08.940]
Every day he shows preempted by Marlins spring training games with the regular season to come. Oh, that's right

[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:15.460]
Oh my god, I forgot about that. They're gonna be settled by the marlins in all those daytime games all those afternoon games

[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:16.760]
Won't that be great?

[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:17.900]

[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:25.520]
Once again something not so sports related to Smothered by the stench of sports nice going ticket

It says at least we get to listen you guys all four hours now

[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.160]
I'm sure you missed the short days as the result of the marlins when you guys had them

[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.560]
But at least your ratings won't suffer from the half a good one since Kevin. Yeah good point Kevin

[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:37.880]
They're gonna kill that Le Bastard show

[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:41.740]
And maybe we can siphon what's his name? I wrote windbag over there

[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:48.160]
Phil says what is it with the big old promo being played during the breaks you might ask George to play it

[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.820]
Does the big old know that Jay Santos and a Phil Henry character?

[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:58.120]
Although the caller is a fake Jay Santos paying tribute to yours truly smile to the suits Neil says Phil Henry. Yeah, haha

[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.120]
Smout of the suits, okay

[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:05.620]
And

[01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:07.300]
Here's one from Kyle bus

[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:15.100]
How do you tell a teenager I trust you behind a wheel but that driving is both a privilege and important responsibility without pushing them away?

[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:19.480]
God is this boring it's from Kyle bus and it's written to Kyle bus I see

[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:27.100]
Too many butts and that baby for me. I'll tell you that get these emails going. Let's get some of those fakers on here again

[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.740]
Neil at Neil Rogers dot com

[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:36.940]
Have the trends out this morning. We did not so bad pretty sad said commentary when we get numbers like that and we're like raving about them

[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:41.540]
Yeah raving, but once what's his name Bob McKay comes back to take over the PD job

[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.820]
Then they will fear us

[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.360]
Now what kind of guy was he did you know him?

[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:54.720]
Briefly he was a okay guy. I thought yeah nice guy short guy beard

[01:10:55.340 --> 01:11:00.880]
He wasn't like what's his name Andrew Asinwood that just never let's go never met him. I don't know you by that I

[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:03.240]
Don't know

[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:10.720]
And he shares how was no mufflinzy no one is we were doing good when muffles are at the controls

[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:17.000]
Yeah, and then of course then he made a bad mistake make clearance the assistant PD and clearance got off the shift

[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.620]
And he knocked him in the back took his job forced duct to become a sales hole just to survive

[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:28.560]
So I think it would be very appropriate if they blew out clearance, but they won't do that. He's still got all those pictures

[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.840]
Right, there must be good pictures

[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.420]
He's not going anywhere. Nope

[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:40.720]
Very macocknases. We're not a bunch of crazy cougs as you're just saying we're real people with real feelings leave very macocknor alone

[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:46.620]
Screw John ZTR says and then he's got a code word that I won't read on here signed very macocknor

[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:49.340]
Oh

[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:54.160]
The stuff that comes in here and you and you don't appreciate it. That's what that's what it irritates me lately

[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.620]
The thousand two fifty eight you don't appreciate all this good material

[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:03.640]
Sorry, and you don't recognize the fact that we've actually got an outside shot

[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:08.900]
Dead mouse is a Canadian DJ that performs with a giant red mouse head says somebody in a picture of it here great

[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:15.740]
We got a shot at some bonus money because we got I got rid of the calls

[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:22.660]
Okay, and you probably don't believe that you think the audience doesn't like the email the numbers go up and down and it isn't about the emails

[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:24.060]
We have to have that conversation again

[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.980]
It's which ones

[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:39.420]
See this man won't give me credit for anything anything. I'm a survivor. Uh-huh

[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:49.060]
I haven't made it this far all these years thirty three years plus in this market without knowing how to survive right and yet you give me no credit for anything

[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:57.100]
Whatever you say Phil Attsman who's just in a feeding frenzy they says was that at Miami City Hall the other day and city officials couldn't stop talking about how

[01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.340]
Successful the ultra festival was

[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:06.420]
Well George can't stop talking about it either. He had a great time still vibrating Tim and Tampa says it must be nice to be able to go to

[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:11.220]
Woodbine almost every day. Don't you know the world is in recession you take Paco with you to Woodbine once in a while

[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:16.640]
He's a young guy with a golden spoon in his mouth. Why don't you bring Paco on your show once in a while?

[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:19.480]
What kind of a stupid thing with that be to do?

[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:26.340]
Are these us people again with no lives? Oh, we want to hear what Paco sounds like we want to get some inside dope with

[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:30.880]
There's no dope and there's no credit. The only dope is me on the dope. I got some

[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:35.680]
Yeah, I'm sure you do when it comes to dope George is the that's his area of expertise

[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:41.380]
20 till noon 20 minutes before our thing opens our neodymium

[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:43.760]
I

[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:15.860]
D

[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:41.180]
The cyber radio is what we take its place

[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:44.480]
They hold the satellite to orbit out in space

[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.980]
And find the way for thousands of hours as the fan

[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:51.440]
If you expect to get your soul played on the air

[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.100]
Game over now, on this far-right

[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:57.420]
The channel feels the radio star

[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:01.700]
The channel feels the radio star

[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:04.920]
The channel feels the radio star

[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:08.400]
The channel feels the radio star

[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:13.420]
The channel feels the radio star

[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:14.240]
The channel feels the radio star

[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:14.660]
They suck

[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:16.440]
They blow

[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:17.700]
They stink

[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:19.200]
Keep channel

[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.280]
And that includes you, Ken Charles, what a loser

[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.880]
So who did the morning this morning on the Cross Street?

[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:25.860]
Oh, it's going to be a spy report on that

[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:26.740]
We need a data report

[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:28.520]
Have a lot of this silly cousin ride back and forth

[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.500]
Oh, I'm the real this one, I'm the fake that one

[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.160]
But in the meantime, where are some information?

[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:32.600]
Right

[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:36.260]
And we wouldn't know because now I bet you're fleeing my cum writing in there

[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:37.700]
Because he's a radio spy

[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:39.720]
Right, or someone will text me

[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.820]
Maybe somebody will tweet, Twitter and tweet

[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:45.540]
Here's one that says, kiss my grapes, Neil

[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:48.280]
I wonder how many candies George took during the Ultra Music Festival

[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.240]
By the way, Prodigy sucked, it says

[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.080]
Yeah, yeah

[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.300]
Did Prodigy suck?

[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.500]
They were great, they were phenomenal

[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:56.280]
One of the best shows ever

[01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:58.220]
Yeah, what do you want to do?

[01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:59.480]
Kiss my grapes, my ass

[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.880]
Half of one

[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:04.040]
Another sour push, there's another reason to hate being in South Florida

[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:05.280]
Oh, and by the way, I changed the poll

[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.000]
Okay

[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:10.520]
Phil Attsman says, I have a day off so I'm getting my Neil Fix

[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:13.880]
Sounding great as always, I like the way George and Flea sound together when you're out there

[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:17.140]
Well, the good part of that is that the week after next, it'll be me and Flea

[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.880]
And then the week after that, George and Flea

[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:20.620]
Vacations come up

[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:21.600]
And you know something?

[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:22.100]
No

[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.320]
It's April 2

[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:27.600]
Just a couple of months away from that June summer schedule start

[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.080]
No, then you get a lot of George and Flea

[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:33.120]
Now, it's Flea going to be doing the summer shows with you as far as I know

[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:33.480]
I know

[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:34.680]
Wow

[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:37.280]
Because he does it for Flea for free

[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.580]
Flea does it for free?

[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:41.920]
Yeah, in the show too

[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.920]
Oh, no

And I don't want to read the whole thing, let me just read the top three

[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:55.380]
The thing I hate most about living in South Florida is the Effing Traffic 177

[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:58.220]
Unbearable heat from May to October, 180

[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:00.780]
He had a heat index on most days, 166

[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:02.700]
So many numbers and so little time

[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:04.760]
I think I might sneeze again

[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:08.680]
Well wait, that cold is almost over but I think I might have one or two sneezes left in me

[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:11.540]
Weasers and sneezes, not this one though, it's

[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:12.360]
No, look at the lighting

[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:15.580]
Don't live there no more when you saw 421

[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.820]
Never lived there, 35, I'm going to sneeze

[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:26.060]
Wow

[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:32.540]
So don't live there no more and never live there between those two, it's about 16%.

[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:35.500]
A lot of people are not South Florida people anymore or never were

[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:39.960]
Which is quite a tribute to us with the tremendous publicity we get on the show

[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.500]
The tremendous promotion

[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:44.080]
You just wait till Bob McKay comes back

[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:45.080]
Can't wait

[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:50.900]
Oh Cliff and Kendall sent this to me yesterday afternoon

[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:54.560]
I hit the man lying in the road

[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:58.120]
What?

[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:02.980]
The officer smelled out calling his breath and described Stahlworth's eyes as bloodshot and watery

[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:06.960]
A blood sample was taken from Stahlworth and forwarded to a lab at U of M

[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:10.020]
Where results showed his blood alcohol level was 0.126

[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:14.800]
Stahlworth later told police that they might be of each police station that he had time to hunk his horn

[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.800]
And flash his headlights to Warren Rayas who was not in a crosswalk

[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:23.920]
Cliff and Kendall says after reading Donnie's description of the accident I am a sickened

[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:29.000]
He saw a man lying in the road he hunked his horn flashed his lights and proceeded to mow this poor slob over

[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:30.680]
Is that the way it works?

[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.560]
If you flash your lights and hunk your horn to pedestrian this fear game?

[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.200]
I guess

[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:40.520]
Donnie you worth millions next time checking the fountain to infinity of sober ups as Cliff and Kendall was pretty pissed off about it

[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:42.800]
Donnie Stahlworth, piece of turd

[01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:45.320]
Have another drink, Danny

[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:46.540]
Danny

[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.560]
You want to hear the new poll?

[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:49.420]
Please

[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:51.420]
You don't care

[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:52.240]
Of course I do

[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.220]
I can tell by the way you said that

[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.020]
Boy, don't cry

[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.980]
That's C-Sneeze

[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:00.180]
Set me back a bit

[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:01.460]
I already voted on it

[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:05.660]
20 votes already on the brand new poll man they are all over it like stink on Sid Rosenberg

[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:06.280]
Who is a tough choice

[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.980]
He goes out with a one share

[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:16.060]
In both demos many team plus in persons 25 54 1.4 1.4 whatever yet. What's the point?

[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.080]
He was a flop

[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:22.380]
Not to mention the other reasons which we found out why he got canned which we won't put on the air but nevertheless

[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:26.220]
I'll let you talk about it on the air don't do it

[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:26.540]
No

[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:32.580]
Generally this is the poll generally you get the absolute worst service at blank

[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:34.900]
Wal-Mart 5

[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:36.360]

[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:48.140]

I can't wait till the book comes out we can see his two to four numbers

[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.700]
Obviously he really helped us a lot in Mad Dog

[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:04.800]
He just really put him

[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.320]
To sleep

[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.780]
You know managed to really great following us

[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:13.760]

Remember those days?

[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:14.700]
Sure

[01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:16.860]
He did sensational

[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:19.740]
But following

[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.400]
Comin' at ya

[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.580]
And the big

[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:23.100]
Oh

[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.620]
He's had problems

[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:26.440]
How about that?

[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:30.920]
And of course at nighttime now that we got that 0.3 in person's 2554

[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:35.600]
Although let's be honest if you double it to get the mail number you got an 0.6 there

[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:36.680]
What?

[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:37.220]
What?

[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:37.760]
Oh I'm sorry

[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.640]
And I'll be making a funny funny D.A.

[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:41.680]
Okay just because he's a very nice guy

[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:45.100]
Joe Bell's buddy and he brought him in from Kansas City by way of West Coast of Florida

[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:47.240]
He's a very nice guy who wish nothing but the best for it

[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:52.440]
Exactly I wish him the best too but he's having a difficult time following that horrible 7-8 hour

[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.560]
And not only that but like tonight

[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:55.220]
Oh

[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.740]
I haven't even given the schedule yet you know what?

[01:20:59.400 --> 01:20:59.740]
Well

[01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:00.320]
Well then

[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:03.520]
That's why I'm in a good mood when I give this schedule especially Thursday

[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:09.020]
We got the big O-2 mad dog 4-7 hurricane hotline 7-8 with a wooden Kimba Bo camper

[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:12.280]
8-9 high school gridiron report

[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.720]
How many people listen to that?

[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:19.700]
The A-9 to midnight again trying to follow just an impossible task even they hercally

[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:22.360]
And task that even D.A. can't pull off

[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:30.580]
A 0.3 on this once mighty radio station

[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:34.660]
Of course what people are telling me is that at nighttime if you think the signal is bad in the daytime with a human interference

[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:37.780]
At nighttime it's like invisible

[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:40.980]
Like we have vanished from the radio dial

[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:44.900]
But you wait till we get that new stick up there you know we're gonna stick the stick no

[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:49.760]
That's what what's his name Bob McCay is coming back for

[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:53.840]
After several heartfelt meetings with the Bruce Beasley

[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.740]
He decided it was time to hang it up

[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:01.540]
A lot of heartfelt meetings going on this business lady you know what this business is done yet

[01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:08.540]
And we're still here you gave me a lot of crap for signing that new deal you know but that I had no other choices

[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:11.040]
That was it take it or leave it

[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:18.160]
And I look at all the people who aren't even on the air anymore for example yeah that one

[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:19.140]
Yep

[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:25.100]
And Tom don't like us there's a whole list of people who aren't on the air who vanished who disappeared

[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:31.320]
Jeff says another example of large corporations wanting to spend minimal money

[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:38.960]
And it says shove product through their advertising pipeline whatever that means

[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:44.520]
The soap opera guiding light is switching off after a 72 year run that predates television

[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:49.140]
What's a good thing I stopped watching that years ago I don't watch no soap anymore it's bad for my image good

[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:56.400]
CBS is the show will have its final episode in September like most daytime dramas guiding light is suffered from declining ratings

[01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:02.260]
And CBS is looking for a lower cost alternative to the hour of programming lower cost alternative you hear that

[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:04.200]
No

[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:13.340]
The Guinness book of world records has cited guiding light is the longest running television drama and began as a 15 minute serial on NBC radio in January

[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:22.500]
1937 and debuted on CBS TV in 1952 focusing on the Bauer family of Springfield Illinois or Springfield Michigan or are we the way to know where it is Springfield

[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:34.840]
The Bauer there was Papa Bauer and Mama Bauer and baby's Nitsyeta her leg cut off and then she died yeah was there a black bow and Ed Bauer Grizzly Bauer baby Bauer

[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:39.140]

[01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:55.080]
Papa Mauer Nistva Nistva that's all he ever said on the show Nistva I don't even know what that means Nistva you know what that means no what I don't know I knew I would tell you and guess what time it is boys and girls how do you do the time see that's when life was

[01:23:55.080 --> 01:24:11.620]
It's simpler when we had a TV show called Howdy Doody I don't think you would say that today mm-hmm somebody would probably file a whole bunch of complaints with the FCC oh we're going to find you $50 zillion for saying duty probably in fact you know who else says that and I never play it either no

[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:23.160]
SUDs well that makes us feel like duty see there you go duty you can't say do it not anymore well hi there Mr. Doody

[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:35.800]
yeah Buffalo Bob used to approach the puppet and say well hello there hi there Mr. Doody can you imagine walking up to somebody saying hi Mr. Doody no maybe you can walk up the touch met and say hi Mr. Schmidt

[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:39.720]
and this is a max look at a size this no it's terrific because you know we are

[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:44.720]

[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:31.880]

[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:38.460]
Do it no or he says please add post office to the poll if there were private business they'd be out of business

[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:45.700]
And the ask for a bailout a man the poster office good choice nothing like going to the post office when there's a long line

[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:50.800]
And there's like one person working and you wonder where the other two or three people you know all the other spots and

[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:55.480]
Smoke and cigarettes I guess or going through the packages to see if there's anything good in there

[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:06.780]
Wow wouldn't that be a lot of fun don't send money through the mail because you never know if it's going to get where it's supposed to be going

[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:16.100]
Don't send George any drugs through the mail because it definitely won't get there right so flea is John's ETR huh is that could be but I don't believe it

[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:22.260]

[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:36.060]
Jan says I was in public when you switched the poll I didn't hear the requirements for the poll there are no requirements it's a question

[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:50.100]

[01:30:50.600 --> 01:31:04.120]

Keats says sometimes you last George an opinion or question then you cut them off that's not nice sometimes he'll try to say something about a story email just read and you'll say what to him and then just continue out of the next email or issue before it gets to say anything

[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:38.860]
sometimes he tries to say something and you act like you're not even listening please try not to do this anymore everyone picks on George and says that he's not interested in the show well it's probably because you're doing you're so dang mean to him yeah that's right I'm so dang mean to George when you were out all George it was talked nice about you and boost up your persona talking about how he got you a digital camera and how he asked you to take pictures of your daily life to intrigue you with it you were your fans

over after it's over so I just I just mentioned that in passing you're gonna have to shake some

[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:17.100]
shake some apples off a tree somewhere get somebody on top of this you know it's a damn good

[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:21.000]
thing I printed that out now instead of waiting until like later and after the show and so on

[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:34.060]
George Ann says the place where the service was the abso freaking loopley worst is now in the

[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:39.080]
schmitter circuit city a place where you walked in and the employees would scatter in order not to

[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:43.980]
help you God forbid you would ask for an item that was locked in a cabinet the employee would say

[01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:48.400]
they didn't have a key and we'll get somebody that did and as predicted would walk away never to be

[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:53.840]
seen again that's why I like best buy the staff is not on commission so they don't push a bunch

[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:58.540]
of Schmidt always listening George and I don't know I voted for best buy now I may have changed

[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:02.600]
he's absolutely correct I mean they had some really good prices and you can see why because they

[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:08.180]
don't pay for your pitch mini yeah but best buy used to be horrible and everything was always

[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:12.080]
required you finding somebody to get a ladder because the item that you wanted was up on a shelf

[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:16.580]
for you'll high you know when George walked in there he was real high but the items were up high

[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:25.700]
yeah I just flew right up and got him wow Scott says hardies at hardies to the pool the only

[01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:28.780]
problem with that Scott is we don't have hardies in south Florida he's over there in the west coast

[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:33.240]
so there's no point in putting something on the pool that doesn't exist in south Florida you

[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:39.380]
understand what I'm saying I do I think I made a good point thank you see one thing about me I

[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:46.000]
usually almost always agree with whatever I say coincidence now here's Brandon LaFave

[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:52.600]

[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:56.900]
canned everywhere he goes for one reason or another and in this case there was a reason and of course

[01:42:56.900 --> 01:43:02.620]
the other reason being crappy numbers I mean when you keep coming up with one shares month after month

[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:06.820]
book after book anybody can get like a bogus book or a bogus trend you know

[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:13.600]
but every single trend month after month after month he couldn't crack a one share anymore he couldn't

[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:20.020]
get a two and you think they're going to continue paying I don't I have no idea how much you

[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:23.980]
was pulling down over there but they're going to pay anybody the way the economy is right now

[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:29.160]
I mean all these people getting blown out they're going to pay people for one shares no I think

Tim and Tampa who's an expert says George is right this time he had Tim's an expert on radio

[01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:47.860]
I agree with George when he says your numbers go up and down you have some good and bad color

[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:51.900]
and good and bad emails your numbers on the rise has nothing to do with you not taking calls

[01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:59.860]
well uh whatever you say always when I when I sit down here to the show I always listen to the

[01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:03.400]
advice of some anonymous email are out there as opposed to using my own judgment

[01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:09.620]
and in addition to which I'm not taking calls and you want to know why I don't want to

[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:16.160]

I killed them on the craps table the slot machines are good if you and here here comes

[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:29.220]

you ready ready strapped in got it got it strapped on the slot machine

[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:42.820]

[01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:53.620]

the show it's when I was ill and I'm not all that ill in today but all that food you read

[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:05.340]
especially that dessert that makes me just wild oh I'm saving it I'm savoring it

and even on hogging does five ice cream sounds good haven't seen it nowhere is yet

[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:16.560]
but I will one thing about hogging does man they are sure good marketers they've got everywhere

[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:21.320]
in the world you go there's a certain amount of Ben and Jerry's but there's a hundred times more

[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:29.980]
hogging does like an amster them on the dam rack I'm trying to think of the name of the store where

[01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:36.760]
they sell the it's against a candy store and in the front they have ice cream and I'm pretty sure

[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:44.400]
it's hogging does okay no actually it's Ben and Jerry's oh well because they have because they have

[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:52.080]
fish food every now and then okay Ben and Jerry's since I told you since they sold it yeah

[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:57.400]
nothing in the toilet they make the worst garbage now it is just it's impossible right how how can

[01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:01.000]
you do that how can you be the best one day in the worst the next day how how is that possible

[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:08.740]
corporate suits as Joe Bell that question Phil says I am in South Florida and listen online

[01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:15.320]

[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:28.960]

it's

[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:32.240]
First Jim said he felt a little bit foolish.

[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:33.000]
I don't like that.

[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:34.640]
You're not gonna want her.

[01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:36.960]
But now he says, I like it.

[01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:38.700]
I like it.

[01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:40.820]
The mad dog just can't piss enough

[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:42.420]
with that cottage cheese butt.

[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:44.580]
If he wants me to sing God Bless America

[01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:47.120]
and paste these in the jeep string up here, I'll do it.

[01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:52.480]
I got food and everybody knows that it's all right.

[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:54.660]
Oh, it's all right.

[01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:57.180]
Listen to the mad dog sing himself happy.

[01:55:57.180 --> 01:55:58.000]
Oh, it's right.

[01:55:58.500 --> 01:55:59.060]
I'm right.

[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:00.240]
I'm right.

[01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:02.320]
I'm right.

[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:04.880]
Jim said it.

[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:05.760]
Sing duet.

[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:06.660]
It's available now.

[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:07.540]
It all blocked us.

[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:09.500]
But guess what I still don't have, George?

[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:11.180]
The entries?

[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:11.860]
Right.

[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:15.220]
Well, I sent Steve's phone in email a while ago.

[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:17.300]
Yeah, right after you and I.

[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:19.280]
First of all, why would I be getting this from Ron Nicoletti?

[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:21.820]
I know he's the handicraft for a Gulf Stream.

[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:22.940]
But what has he got to do with us?

[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:25.060]
Maybe Steve or someone else asked him to do that.

[01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:26.160]
Well, I tell you one thing.

[01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:29.240]
Don't ask him again because it's obviously a chore way too big

[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:30.140]
for Mr. Nicoletti.

[01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:34.460]
I mean, maybe it was the fake Ron Nicoletti

[01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:35.880]
that sent me guys out the entries.

[01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:37.540]
Because the real one, I don't think,

[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:40.540]
would be that stupid to send me the entries from last week.

[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:45.300]
You follow what I'm saying?

[01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:45.560]
Yep.

[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:48.920]
Got a half-n-stief Sloan.

[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:49.860]
Get with it.

[01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:50.300]
Schmuck.

[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:53.280]
Blackie says Neil and one of the PSAs on the net.

[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:54.760]
There's a law firm ad.

[01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:57.180]
And the promoter lawyer says,

[01:56:58.100 --> 01:57:00.360]
it's his duty to serve his clients on their rights,

[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:01.040]
yadi-adi-adi.

[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:02.160]
It says Blackie.

[01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:03.220]
He says duty.

[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:04.200]
Yeah.

[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:08.220]
Don't we say that in the Boy Scouts or the Covers in whatever it is?

[01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:09.740]
I promise you my best to do my duty.

[01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:10.080]
Right.

[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:12.260]
I tell you one thing.

[01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:13.660]
I should do the best to do my duty.

[01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:14.540]
And I do it every day.

[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:19.280]
I do it like a clockwork, like a ritual.

[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:24.740]
I bet your mom is rolling over and hell-right.

[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:25.940]
And I mean heaven right now.

[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:28.480]
I think she's jealous.

[01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:29.620]
Jealousy.

[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:31.620]
She was always jealous of your duty.

[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:34.060]
Of my Lucy Bowls.

[01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:37.460]
Armando says,

[01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:41.700]
hagandas rocky road with a touch of condensed milk is a part of your mouth.

[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:43.160]
Signed the fake Armando.

[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:44.620]
It sounds like crap to me.

[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:45.720]
A touch of condensed milk.

[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:47.560]
Okay.

[01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:50.340]
Well, what is that all about?

[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:53.180]
Hagandas rocky road, like I said, is okay.

[01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:54.000]
Just okay.

[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:55.060]
Okay.

[01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:59.120]
It's not anywhere near like bastard Robbins rocky road is all awesome.

[01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:01.480]
Just freaking awesome.

[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:04.880]
Condensed milk.

[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:08.260]
I mean the kind of stuff that people concoct that they put together.

[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:09.920]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:11.620]
I don't understand it.

[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:13.500]
Why would you put condensed milk?

[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:15.340]
I'm assuming thing I gotta say.

[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:16.180]
Is it?

[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:20.380]
They use that for a sweetener in certain desserts like the dual say did whatever fill in the blank.

[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:22.400]
Dual say a lace bag?

[01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:22.780]
Yes.

[01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:25.660]
Do she do a lace bag?

[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:27.160]
Yes.

[01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:40.360]
Here's one from Daryl who says I only found out today that Brian James died in March.

[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:42.100]
Do you know who that is?

[01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:42.660]
No.

[01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:45.120]
I don't get to hear you much.

[01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:47.700]
I didn't know if you had heard the story DM.

[01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:50.760]
Is that something we talked about or something?

[01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:51.480]
What?

[01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:53.080]
Is that something we talked about or something?

[01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:54.400]
I never heard of Brian James.

[01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:56.540]
Jesse James.

[01:58:57.140 --> 01:59:00.540]
Ben Schmiegel says your eating habits are a dial turner.

[01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:01.020]
Good bye.

[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:03.000]
Yeah, good bye for the four hundred time.

[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:03.620]
Good bye.

[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:06.020]
Let me put it to this way Ben.

[01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:07.380]
Bye, bye, bye.

[01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:08.180]
Yeah, bye, bye.

[01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:11.360]
It's my way or the highway.

[01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:13.840]
If I can't listen to the radio without being grossed out, I will not listen.

[01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:14.460]
Good bye.

[01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:21.080]
To think I looked up to you at one point in time.

[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:26.140]
Now he looks down because he went to etiquette school and he's a real big shot.

[01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:30.700]
Ben Schmiegel took John's ETR a while to get that one going.

[01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:32.980]
Or maybe a fat boy.

[01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:38.680]
I think we ought to get Joe Bell's private detective working on that.

[01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:39.200]
Oh you?

[01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:39.920]
Absolutely.

[01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:41.740]
Absolutely.

[01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:47.020]
I got a couple of things here in my pile but I got news for you.

[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:48.340]
It's going to take us till two o'clock.

[01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:50.340]
We'll be honest.

[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:52.860]
Real, real, sad situation.

[01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:57.040]
If I were even tempted to turn on that monitor, take a few calls.

[01:59:58.320 --> 01:59:59.600]
I would not be pleased.

[02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:01.780]
I ain't twisting your.

[02:00:03.540 --> 02:00:04.180]
Take calls.

[02:00:04.460 --> 02:00:05.160]
No, not at all.

[02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:07.200]
You like them but I want to leave them for you.

[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:09.080]
Well thank you.

[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:12.780]
Because the week after next I mean you're going to be on all week I'll be on vacation and you and free.

[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:15.540]
You're going to be taking a lot of calls, a lot of great calls.

[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:17.880]
Take it a moment.

[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:20.960]
Maybe you can go around a building like somebody I know used to.

[02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:21.620]
Come and add you.

[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:23.280]
And set some stuff up.

[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:24.860]
Set up some good fake calls.

[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:25.480]
How about that?

[02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:26.360]
Yeah.

[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:30.260]
I'll start writing the scripts now.

[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:35.540]
So Jorge Zedano is going to be doing morning starting Monday along with him a cast of...

[02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:36.240]
And Karen Kay?

[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:37.560]
Is that what we heard?

[02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:38.940]
Wow, the sheepin on that.

[02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:41.200]
I can't be familiar.

[02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:43.920]
Karen, freaking Kay.

[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:48.020]
Well you know she failed on IOD so it's a good idea to bring her back.

[02:00:48.860 --> 02:00:49.160]
Right.

[02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:52.740]
Is the Walter Sable coming along with this package too?

[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:54.180]
I had one in my mouth once.

[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:55.860]
Oh I'm sure more than once.

[02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:01.380]
Anyway Scott Levinson in regard to the previous pool moving out of South Florida.

[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:04.580]
He said yes I did but unfortunately as I've said many times before.

[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:07.720]
Phanellis Park makes Tamerak look like paradise.

[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:11.080]
I thought the Aldecockers my conduit,

[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:12.620]
Roques to were bad enough.

[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:13.520]
Roques?

[02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:15.180]
I don't know.

[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:17.860]
But Phanellis car worshipping red necks here make them look human.

[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:24.700]
The toothless locals here drive roasted out pickup trucks covered in rebel flags,

[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:27.420]
Jesus fish and NASCAR number three stickers.

[02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:32.220]
I have anti-bush anti-war stickers on my car.

[02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:37.020]
It's not surprising that the drivers with the Jesus fish spirit 90.52 life tags are the ones

[02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:39.760]
who give you the finger and scream at you to get the F out of our country.

[02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:46.100]
They're just as bad in Walmart, Savalot as the old parts are at publics back in South Florida.

[02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:48.960]
We do have publics here and the red necks avoid it too expensive for them.

[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:52.180]
Dollar general Walmart is their version of Bloomingdale's bird eyes.

[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:58.760]
The way they drive up and down US-19 or Gandy Park Boulevard is just as bad as the condo

[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:00.240]
commando's and university drive.

[02:02:01.220 --> 02:02:06.220]
Yes I'm crazy to say this but I'd rather be back in Broward than hearing this God forsaken Joyce Hole.

[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:11.040]
Funny to note there's a development here called Mainlands of Tamrak and yes,

[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:14.060]
it's a 55 plus place.

[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:18.060]
Signed Scott Stuck in Hell Oops Penelos Park.

[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:22.180]
Well, so if you think you got a bad being stuck in South Florida,

[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:27.220]
you can only be imagined being stuck on a West Coast, although they do have good restaurants over there.

[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:34.280]
What's that place with a strawberry pie that I can never think of the name of it's on Davy Road Extension?

[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:39.540]
Right by 595.

[02:02:39.980 --> 02:02:40.480]
I don't know.

[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:42.560]
Right near the head with the Godfather's.

[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:43.040]
I don't know.

[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:44.540]
From the chain from Detroit.

[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:45.760]
Stooky.

[02:02:46.380 --> 02:02:51.880]
No, slur they have slim gyms and not slim gyms like sausages but slim gyms sandwiches.

[02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:52.740]
Really?

[02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:53.620]
Ooh.

[02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:55.940]
I have a mental block with that place.

[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:56.640]
I don't know why.

[02:02:57.020 --> 02:02:58.280]
I've eaten there a zillion times.

[02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:01.520]
But they've got the best damn strawberry pie.

[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:03.960]
Mmm.

[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:07.580]
So you got me started with the food talking about all those stuff.

[02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:09.460]
Hey, it's going to happen on Thursdays.

[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:11.040]
How are we doing with the certificates by the way?

[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:12.080]
Let me tell you what, don't tell me.

[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:13.580]
Oh, don't tell me.

[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:14.740]
Sorry, I'm a bastard.

[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:16.880]
Yeah, I know that.

[02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:18.720]
Bastard from a basket.

[02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:21.700]
Okay.

[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:24.660]
Now, Primavera we got only 64 left.

[02:03:27.340 --> 02:03:28.040]
Primavera Restaurant.

[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:29.160]
64 left.

[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:35.420]
And these are 225's by the way.

[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:38.760]
I'm not saying much.

[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:39.920]
Last week I said a lot.

[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:41.040]
This week I'm not saying much.

[02:03:42.420 --> 02:03:44.520]
Everybody in this building in your building is an expert.

[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:46.000]
All the sales people are experts.

[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:48.020]
We know nothing.

[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:49.980]
We just do this stuff on a year.

[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:51.960]
And they're the experts.

[02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:54.380]
Just like these e-mailers, they're the experts.

[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:56.300]
The thousand three hundred and six and a half point.

[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:01.080]
It's almost one o'clock which means during this next break I'm going to like

[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:02.640]
put on my pantaloonies and my shoes.

[02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:05.020]
Yeah.

[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:09.220]
Maybe spritz a little more right card and left card under my...

[02:04:09.220 --> 02:04:13.200]
I told you the strip about the woman at the wood mine who told me how good he smelled good.

[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:14.780]
Doesn't that nice?

[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:15.580]
That is very nice.

[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:17.220]
And I do.

[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:17.960]
Good.

[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:20.520]
And like I've always told you this is why I'm...

[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:22.200]
And see it paid off and I got nice compliment.

[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:25.640]
And even Paco yesterday told me I smelled good.

[02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:27.140]
When I gave him a good buy hug you know.

[02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:29.380]
So you smell great.

[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:30.360]
That's nice.

[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:32.620]
If you can't look good, smell good.

[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:34.840]
It doesn't cost much to smell good.

[02:04:35.980 --> 02:04:36.540]
Soap is cheap.

[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:36.740]
Right?

[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:37.760]
Soap is cheap.

[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:38.940]
Right.

[02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:42.780]
And they got real cheap like aftershave and stuff.

[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:43.280]
Right.

[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:44.980]
So if you know that doesn't smell good.

[02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:46.360]
What?

[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:48.000]
The cheap aftershave?

[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:49.320]
Well not the cheap stuff.

[02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:49.540]
Yeah.

[02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:51.280]
Steal some expensive stuff.

[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:51.580]
That's right.

[02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:55.620]
Here's one from John ZTR.

[02:04:55.820 --> 02:04:59.400]
The reason for me sending all the crap today is that work is exceptionally slow.

[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:04.460]
Anyway of course I don't work at WQM and I'm not the fake radio experts.

[02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:08.880]
Oh this guy is sad.

[02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:10.620]
He's really sad.

[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:11.460]
And you like him.

[02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:13.120]
He's your hero you said.

[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:13.380]
Yeah.

[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.000]
You didn't say that.

[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:23.460]
I don't know.

[02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:23.860]
I don't know.

[02:05:23.860 --> 02:05:24.120]
I don't know.

[02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:24.380]
I don't know.

[02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:24.740]
I don't know.

[02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:24.740]

[02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:24.840]
I don't know.

[02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:24.840]

[02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:24.840]

[02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:25.060]
I don't know.

[02:05:25.060 --> 02:05:25.060]

[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:25.660]
I don't know.

[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:26.060]
I don't know.

[02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:26.520]
I don't know.

[02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:26.860]
I don't know.

[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:27.740]
I don't know.

[02:05:27.740 --> 02:05:28.140]
I don't know.

[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:28.140]

[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:28.140]

[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:33.420]
I don't know.

[02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:34.700]
I don't know.

[02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:36.420]
I don't know.

[02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:36.660]
I don't know.

[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:37.040]
I don't know.

[02:05:37.340 --> 02:05:37.920]
I don't know.

[02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:38.200]
I don't know.

[02:05:38.780 --> 02:05:41.220]
I don't know.

[02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:42.000]
I don't know.

[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:44.980]
I don't know.

[02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:02.420]
I don't know.

[02:06:11.580 --> 02:06:11.740]
I don't know.

[02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:11.740]

[02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:11.740]

[02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:11.740]

[02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:11.740]

[02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:11.740]

[02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:11.960]
I don't know.

[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:14.720]

[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:14.720]

[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:14.720]

[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:14.960]

[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:14.960]

[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:14.960]

[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:14.960]

[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:14.960]

[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:14.960]

[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:14.960]

[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:14.960]

[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:14.960]

[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:14.960]

[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:14.960]

[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:14.960]

[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:14.960]

[02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:25.060]
I don't know.

[02:06:25.060 --> 02:06:27.920]
I don't know.

[02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:28.300]

[02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:28.320]
I don't know.

[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:28.320]

[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:28.320]

I don't know.

[02:06:28.360 --> 02:06:28.360]

I don't know.

[02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:28.840]

[02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:28.880]
I don't know.

[02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:28.880]

[02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:28.880]

[02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:29.060]
I don't know.

[02:06:29.060 --> 02:06:29.280]
I don't know.

[02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:29.460]
I don't know.

[02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:30.160]

[02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:30.720]
I don't know.

[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:31.280]
I don't know.

[02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:32.700]
I don't know.

[02:06:33.500 --> 02:06:40.600]
I don't know.

[02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:42.040]
I don't know.

[02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:44.940]
I don't know.

[02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:45.340]
I don't know.

[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:45.340]

[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:45.340]

[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:45.340]

[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:45.340]

[02:06:45.500 --> 02:06:45.760]
so keep making bites,

[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:46.960]
while listening to the Neil Rogers.

[02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:48.020]
One or two hours.

[02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:50.400]
After years of drug abuse

[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:52.100]
and controversial rehabilitation,

[02:06:52.780 --> 02:06:53.960]
Beachboy, Brian Wilson,

[02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:57.380]
is going to release a collection of his latest compositions.

[02:06:57.480 --> 02:06:59.460]
Thanks for having us this interview, Brian.

[02:07:01.020 --> 02:07:04.340]
Brian, do you have any idea how he tardid you sound?

[02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:05.000]
No.

[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.760]
That's... that's...

[02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:08.180]
You'll show you what I mean.

[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:10.020]
Here's how you sounded back in 62

[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:12.540]
from this early Beach Boy recording session.

[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:14.180]
Hey, man.

[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:15.980]
Did you like it?

[02:07:17.380 --> 02:07:17.640]
Yeah.

[02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:18.620]
You look cute.

[02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:19.620]
Uh, you look cute.

[02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:21.760]
My ears...

[02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:22.540]
Man, okay.

[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:24.220]
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:24.880]
Listen.

[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.460]
Did you like it?

[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:32.140]
Oh, that's very nice, Brian.

[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:37.940]
Did you like it?

[02:07:37.940 --> 02:07:39.440]
It's a little hard to dance, too.

[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.060]
Did you like it?

[02:07:45.140 --> 02:07:46.880]
Yeah, very nice, Brian.

[02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:51.140]
The Brian Wilson Collection of Burned Out Composition.

[02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:52.360]
Did you like it?

[02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:53.540]
Oh, yeah.

[02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:57.640]
Uh, the master copy available now on eBay.

[02:07:58.940 --> 02:07:59.700]
Did you like it?

[02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:01.280]
Well, I've got to be going it.

[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:06.860]
Did you like it?

[02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:07.180]
Yeah.

[02:08:07.660 --> 02:08:08.840]
Okay, 101 and 56.

[02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:10.740]
That was for Ben, just in case he's still listening.

[02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:11.440]
Oh.

[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:12.880]
And let's throw in...

[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:14.440]
Oh, one of those two works at charge.

[02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:14.900]
Here.

[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:17.140]
Will says,

[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:20.160]
Big Boy had sandwiches named Brony, Lad and Slim Jim.

[02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:22.480]
I do not recall strawberry pie.

[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:23.260]
Well, I guess what?

[02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:24.720]
They had the best strawberry pie in history.

[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:25.480]
So you missed out.

[02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:26.280]
At the Big Boy?

[02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:27.960]
Shownies Big Boy.

[02:08:28.460 --> 02:08:29.160]
Oh, baby.

[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:32.420]
And Slim Jim was a good sandwich, too.

[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:33.360]
They had good sandwiches.

[02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:34.120]
They had good stuff.

[02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:34.760]
Sounds good.

[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:36.700]
I wonder if that one is still there by Davey Road Extension?

[02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:38.460]
Somebody will call and let us know.

[02:08:39.060 --> 02:08:41.800]
Because there's a haste right there with a Godfather's in it, right?

[02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:44.660]
That to me is...

[02:08:44.660 --> 02:08:45.680]
That proved well, of course.

[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:46.640]
My pie didn't make it.

[02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:49.100]
Ice cream places don't make it in South Florida.

[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:50.940]
Great pizza places don't make it.

[02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:53.800]
My pie didn't make it.

[02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:55.280]
Remember the Chicago style pizza?

[02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:55.660]
Yep.

[02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:56.620]
Well, they had worked a couple other ones.

[02:08:56.860 --> 02:08:57.320]
Didn't make it.

[02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:01.740]
And Godfather's is just, you know, a part of the gas stations.

[02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:03.120]
Right.

[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:05.620]
Now, did you ever have the real Godfather's pizza?

[02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:10.400]
Yeah, there was one over here not far from where I'm sitting right now when I used to live in this area.

[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:11.200]
Yeah.

[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:12.980]
And we got from there all the time it was great.

[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.260]
Because they put the cheese on top.

[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:14.960]
Uh-huh.

[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:16.560]
And it would melt down into the ingredient.

[02:09:16.660 --> 02:09:17.020]
Oh, yeah.

[02:09:17.220 --> 02:09:17.440]
Oh.

[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:17.940]
Mmm.

[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:22.900]
I had another half of a pepperoni stick during the break.

[02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:24.880]
Oh, you didn't save it for the air?

[02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:26.640]
I got another one in there.

[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:28.200]
That was up only 283 now.

[02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:29.360]
It's down below 300.

[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:31.340]
On the upside.

[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:36.100]
Still not bad, but I'm sure Maria will take it.

[02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:37.500]
Maria, would you take it?

[02:09:37.700 --> 02:09:37.940]
Uh-huh.

[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:38.320]
Oh.

[02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:40.800]
Never noticed how Maria sounds just like Larry.

[02:09:41.580 --> 02:09:41.840]
A little bit.

[02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:46.640]
Here's one from somebody who says,

[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:48.560]
I've been in Fort Lauderdale since 2001.

[02:09:49.180 --> 02:09:50.100]
And it's just fine.

[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:53.040]
I worked a weekend so I missed most of the traffic.

[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:54.680]
And when I'm off work, there are no lines.

[02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:56.960]
The beach isn't crowded and the beer is always cold.

[02:09:57.860 --> 02:10:00.400]
I swear when I first heard you talk about the half-priced deals,

[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:02.240]
I thought you were talking about your contract.

[02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:03.000]
Uh-huh.

[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:03.520]
What?

[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:04.280]
Cute.

[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:06.960]
The departure of WINZ is bad news.

[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:09.300]
I've learned some important stuff from listing the radio,

[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:13.860]
your show in Air America, not WIOD, not WIOD.

[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:17.240]
Well, what you'll learn at WIOD is there's a lot of fascists running around.

[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:18.280]
WIOD?

[02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:19.600]
Oh, I hate that station.

[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:20.400]
And who doesn't?

[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:24.580]
And the fact that they got a bunch of slackers over there,

[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:27.340]
sitting on the rest, sending me emails every day,

[02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:29.060]
John's ETR is on my list, by the way.

[02:10:29.060 --> 02:10:30.620]
I'm not dealing with him anymore.

[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:33.360]
Now that I know who it is for sure, OK.

[02:10:34.780 --> 02:10:36.280]
I'm telling you, I know who it is.

[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:37.580]
What I told you is the truth.

[02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:38.780]
I wasn't being sarcastic.

[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:40.100]
That's not PD Lenny.

[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:40.920]
All right.

[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:43.240]
As much as that would certainly be a possibility.

[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:49.080]
I have a feeling that PD Lenny has more of a need to survive, you know?

[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:52.460]
Like go out and sell and do something, especially during these tough days.

[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:54.360]
Whereas the other fat tub of lard,

[02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:57.820]
I'm sure he'd be content to sit on his ass and send emails all day.

[02:10:58.920 --> 02:10:59.620]
Without a doubt.

[02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:00.640]
Right?

[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:01.100]
Right.

[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:04.300]
And just like who sent me the email to my real email address this morning?

[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:05.200]
About the ratings?

[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:06.000]
That's right.

[02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:06.300]
That's right.

[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:10.920]
Which I was not PD Lenny, by the way.

[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:11.780]
Correct.

[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:16.340]
It was another sales hole.

[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:21.960]
Now I want you to listen to something really strange.

[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:22.960]
OK.

[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:25.820]
I mean, as if all of it hasn't been shared.

[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:27.700]
Sure.

[02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:31.320]
I just came out this morning two months of the winter book, and they were not so bad.

[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:33.400]
Not so great, but not so bad.

[02:11:33.660 --> 02:11:36.820]
We got a real shot there in men 2554 when this book comes out.

[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:42.760]
If we get some real wired, I mean some good help from the audience and working my breath, crossing my fingers.

[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:43.620]
Todd.

[02:11:43.780 --> 02:11:44.460]
I didn't look that up.

[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:45.080]
What?

[02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:46.820]
The day for the book.

[02:11:47.140 --> 02:11:47.320]
Oh.

[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:50.720]
One moment, please.

[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:51.760]
No worries.

[02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:14.420]
All right.

[02:12:14.420 --> 02:12:15.100]
April 30th.

[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:16.220]
All right.

[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:16.840]
10 am.

[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:21.240]
April 30th.

[02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:22.000]
That's 28 days.

[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:23.120]
Four weeks from today.

[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:23.520]
Is it not?

[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:25.420]
It sounds not right to me.

[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:27.400]
916, 23rd, 30th.

[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:28.180]
four weeks from today.

[02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:29.440]
We'll be the book.

[02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:32.900]
Could be the, I guess it's the last book and then we go to that people meter thing.

[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:33.980]
Right.

[02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:36.740]
Now which one is the one where we get both?

[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:37.760]
This one or the next one?

[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:38.600]
I don't know.

[02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:40.500]
Don't ask me a lot of questions.

[02:12:42.380 --> 02:12:43.060]
I don't know.

[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:46.980]
Tanner by the way is upset about the PPM.

[02:12:46.980 --> 02:12:50.720]
I got a whole thing that very Jack has sent me a couple weeks ago which I won't waste

[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:51.780]
time reading it on a year.

[02:12:51.940 --> 02:12:52.140]
Okay.

[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:53.040]
Much too complicated.

[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:57.200]
But a lot of the PDs are not real happy with this PPM.

[02:12:57.980 --> 02:12:58.860]
Very inaccurate.

[02:12:59.060 --> 02:12:59.840]
Very full of crap.

[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:01.680]
Not like the system we have no.

[02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:02.680]
Not like Arbitron.

[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:03.660]
That's completely accurate.

[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:04.340]
Like that.

[02:13:04.500 --> 02:13:04.680]
You know.

[02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:07.240]
I listen to radio mambe.

[02:13:07.540 --> 02:13:08.820]
I listen to radio mambe.

[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:10.120]
I'm not radio mambe.

[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:10.660]
Yeah.

[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:11.000]

[02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:12.440]
Mambe my ass.

[02:13:13.540 --> 02:13:16.860]
This is from the building in which I live here.

[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:19.080]
Attention.

[02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:20.240]
Residence and guests.

[02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:21.980]
Now, now let me just make it clear.

[02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:27.120]
And I've told you this before in this building they have either heating or cooling.

[02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:28.140]
Not both.

[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:28.580]
Okay.

[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:32.480]
I mean most, you know, most homes you have central area.

[02:13:32.540 --> 02:13:32.740]
Right.

[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:33.980]
Or you can air condition it.

[02:13:33.980 --> 02:13:34.880]
You know, I like anybody.

[02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:35.360]
No building.

[02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:36.540]
Why is talking about right?

[02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:36.920]
Huh?

[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:39.620]
They either make heat available or cold available building.

[02:13:39.740 --> 02:13:40.000]
Correct.

[02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:40.520]
Okay.

[02:13:41.740 --> 02:13:42.180]
Absolutely.

[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:43.560]
I have no life.

[02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:43.840]
No.

[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:44.760]
Absolutely.

[02:13:45.060 --> 02:13:45.360]
Correct.

[02:13:47.060 --> 02:13:50.380]
Here's the here's the memo they sent out to all residents.

[02:13:51.300 --> 02:13:56.180]
Please be advised that as the seasons change, we will be scheduling the change over from

[02:13:56.180 --> 02:13:56.780]
heat to cooling.

[02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:03.060]
Now I want you to listen to this next sentence very carefully put on your Mickey Mouse

[02:14:03.060 --> 02:14:03.320]
ears.

[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:03.760]
Okay.

[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:08.660]
We'll be waiting until we've experienced 10 consecutive days of temperatures in excess

[02:14:08.660 --> 02:14:09.960]
of 15 degree centigrade.

[02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:11.860]
It's like 59 60.

[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:12.340]
Okay.

[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:17.220]
As soon as this temperature rise has a consistent pattern, we'll announce the schedule

[02:14:17.220 --> 02:14:19.340]
of the change over 10 consecutive days.

[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:24.620]
This is a seasonal change as we cannot forecast the weather.

[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:27.280]
We must anticipate the weather temperature will continue to climb.

[02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:30.120]
The change over will normally take place during the first week or two of May.

[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:31.300]
It all depends on the weather.

[02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:36.360]
Your comfort is our greatest concern during the seasonal change over period.

[02:14:37.780 --> 02:14:39.120]
Signed a real smegegee.

[02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:40.960]
How do you like that?

[02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:42.680]
10 consecutive days.

[02:14:42.900 --> 02:14:48.300]
So what if we had like eight consecutive days of like 18, 19, 20, which is 68.

[02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:51.500]
And then on the ninth day it was like 13, 56.

[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:54.620]
Do we have to wait and start all over again?

[02:14:54.780 --> 02:14:54.940]
Yes.

[02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:56.300]
It resets.

[02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:00.540]
It resets?

[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:00.840]
Yeah.

[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:02.520]
They start counting from zero again.

[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:03.320]
Yeah, reset this.

[02:15:03.580 --> 02:15:03.720]
Okay.

[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:04.920]
Yeah.

[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:06.920]
God.

[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:08.380]
Let's get those emails coming in.

[02:15:08.380 --> 02:15:12.460]
We got 52 minutes to kill here and I'm down to some stuff that I really didn't want to

[02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:12.960]
use at all.

[02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:14.680]
You know what I mean?

[02:15:14.900 --> 02:15:15.080]
Correct.

[02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:15.560]
What do you mean?

[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:19.180]
All of this one's not too bad.

[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:20.800]
Boyfriend dies after catching suicide.

[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:21.340]
A lover.

[02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:22.460]
That's a Chinese story.

[02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:28.520]
Oh, I don't want to be picking on the Chinese one because I do like a lot of Chinese

[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:32.280]
one, but nevertheless, the old, not the old smelly Chinese one.

[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:35.320]
The one I have like about four pounds of hair growing out of their ears.

[02:15:36.940 --> 02:15:38.360]
Now, what is that all about?

[02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:41.500]
Why is it that as we get older, more and more here?

[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:44.340]
I have to use that clip remind you, though, that I shave my head with.

[02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:45.620]
Hormones.

[02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:46.460]
What?

[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:47.200]
Hormones.

[02:15:48.380 --> 02:15:48.820]
Hormones?

[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:49.200]
Yeah.

[02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:52.840]
What should we be talking about?

[02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:56.900]
Well, you know how when you were very young, you didn't have any hair on your body at all.

[02:15:57.760 --> 02:15:57.960]
Yeah.

[02:15:58.100 --> 02:16:03.360]
And as you get older, the hormones trigger hair to grow on certain parts of your body.

[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:05.560]
Really?

[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:06.020]
Yeah.

[02:16:06.260 --> 02:16:07.280]
You notice that part, right?

[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:07.500]
Correct.

[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:07.980]
Yeah.

[02:16:08.500 --> 02:16:10.080]
And it never stops.

[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:15.200]
In other words, you just keep getting hair on new parts of your body.

[02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:18.260]
So if you lived forever, you'd be a werewolf.

[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:24.660]
You keep getting hair on new parts of your body.

[02:16:24.820 --> 02:16:26.020]
You just keep getting more and more hair.

[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:27.580]
Most people, two different degrees, of course.

[02:16:27.700 --> 02:16:30.220]
You know, some people are very hairy by the time they're like, you know, 18.

[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:33.120]
They're, they're, you mean like poppallon, poppallon hair?

[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:33.320]
Yeah.

[02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:37.080]
They got the hair on their shoulders and hair on on their neck and things like that.

[02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:37.320]
What's his name?

[02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:38.060]
One problem.

[02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:38.520]
J.P.

[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:41.260]
It's now a few months ago.

[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:43.600]
I mentioned him and you said you didn't remember who he was.

[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:45.440]
Okay.

[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:49.960]
The, the, the classic, classic example of what happens with drugs.

[02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:50.600]
Yeah.

[02:16:51.300 --> 02:16:52.900]
No, you kept, you kept arguing with him.

[02:16:52.940 --> 02:16:54.080]
I'm sure he was talking to somebody else.

[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:54.440]
What?

[02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:55.060]
Whatever.

[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:58.440]
No, you were mentioning somebody that came to us at a particular dinner and I couldn't

[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:01.020]
remember who it was that came with us.

[02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:02.180]
So you remember him?

[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:03.600]
You remember the hot young guys.

[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:04.000]
I'm sorry.

[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:06.760]
You know, I don't, you know, I remember the hot young girl.

[02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:11.700]
He was a beautiful guy and he had unfortunately for, I mean, not that it made any difference.

[02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:15.920]
And I'm trying to remember who was you and somebody else and maybe was Joe Castello, given

[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:19.640]
a, lifting up his sweater and he was, it was like Harry is a bear.

[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:20.380]
It wasn't me.

[02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:20.680]
Yes.

[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:22.940]
Fuzzy was a bear.

[02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:25.600]
Harry.

[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:26.360]
Yeah.

[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:26.920]
Which you know me.

[02:17:26.980 --> 02:17:27.600]
I don't like Harry.

[02:17:30.440 --> 02:17:31.520]
Can't stand Harry.

[02:17:32.180 --> 02:17:34.320]
Although in this case, I would have just shaved him up.

[02:17:34.420 --> 02:17:35.480]
I'm sure, I'm sure you would have.

[02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:36.160]
I would have cleaned him up.

[02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:38.440]
I remember one day he was in turning.

[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:41.700]
We were sitting in the control room while the morning show was on and I came in and

[02:17:41.700 --> 02:17:44.500]
I looked through that glass window there and I thought, who is that?

[02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:47.820]
Who is that fine looking young stud in there?

[02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:51.600]
By the way, I don't know if you also noticed at that same age he was already, the hair

[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:52.620]
on his head was thinning.

[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:53.540]
They go hand in hand.

[02:17:53.540 --> 02:17:53.660]
Yeah.

[02:17:57.400 --> 02:17:58.760]
How about the hair on his crotch?

[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:00.700]
Was that kind of like filling in?

[02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:01.460]
That I didn't check.

[02:18:01.460 --> 02:18:05.200]
You seem to be pretty much into all his areas.

[02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:07.040]
His areas of expertise.

[02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:07.900]
That's it.

[02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:08.920]
Yeah, it was a J.P.

[02:18:09.020 --> 02:18:09.220]
Expert.

[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:10.500]
J.P.

[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:11.420]
He was, he was okay.

[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:11.940]
He was a good guy.

[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:14.380]
Let's see.

[02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:16.200]
Who on the Toronto Philadelphia game last night?

[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:18.580]
It was on that goofy channel up the NHL center.

[02:18:18.660 --> 02:18:20.160]
I said, Fred and Boko, final score.

[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:21.680]
Philadelphia 2, Toronto 3.

[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:22.880]
Fred.

[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:24.640]
Leafs.

[02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:25.360]
Go, Leafs go.

[02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:26.400]
In a meaningless game.

[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:27.960]
Of course, all the games are Leafs play.

[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:30.360]
When they tell you before the season starts, we're not going to make the playoffs.

[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:32.840]
We're going to think, it makes pretty much all the games meaningless.

[02:18:35.380 --> 02:18:37.000]
Here is one from Jason.

[02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:39.900]
Chronic Jason congrats on the improved numbers you had this morning.

[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:45.000]
During these current economic times, maybe more people are gathering around the free radio

[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:45.820]
like the old days.

[02:18:46.740 --> 02:18:49.220]
Not much material today, but I do have a corny joke for you.

[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:53.400]
Oh, it is so bad.

[02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:54.000]
Do you want to hear it?

[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:55.360]
Yeah, please.

[02:18:55.660 --> 02:18:57.720]
Did you hear about the flashers was considering retiring?

[02:18:58.840 --> 02:18:59.580]
Chains his mind.

[02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:01.300]
He decided to stick it out a little longer.

[02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:07.300]
All the best to you in my favorite spick, George Notpaco, Chester Copperpot.

[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:11.720]
Now who is Chester Copperpot?

[02:19:12.020 --> 02:19:12.740]
What are the ballbusters?

[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:13.960]
But thanks, Chester.

[02:19:13.980 --> 02:19:14.660]
No, no, I don't mean him.

[02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:15.600]
I mean, who is the character?

[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:17.660]
Oh, I don't know.

[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:18.900]
I'll look it up.

[02:19:19.380 --> 02:19:19.940]
Rings it up.

[02:19:19.940 --> 02:19:20.460]
Yeah, look it up.

[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:20.860]
It's important.

[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:23.600]
Oh, I'm having such a nice time.

[02:19:23.720 --> 02:19:24.340]
Well, congratulations.

[02:19:24.660 --> 02:19:25.140]
Get a life.

[02:19:25.140 --> 02:19:25.240]
Please.

[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:35.940]
Thank you for calling the Dow Jones Index Hotline.

[02:19:36.260 --> 02:19:41.900]
Your source for up to the second Wall Street updates at the tone, the Dow Jones will be

[02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:43.160]
7000.

[02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:45.840]
That number has changed.

[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:48.340]
The Dow Jones Index is now 69.

[02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:53.480]
Update, the Dow Jones is now 6800.

[02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:56.500]
The price is now, oh, this can't be.

[02:19:57.120 --> 02:19:58.560]
The Dow Jones is now at 67.

[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:00.360]
Oh, no, they can't.

[02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:00.900]
What?

[02:20:01.500 --> 02:20:03.340]
No, it can't be.

[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:04.740]
It hasn't been this low since.

[02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:06.300]
That's just been handed a note.

[02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:10.460]
I'm now completely bankrupt.

[02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:13.160]
Shut up.

[02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:19.080]
118 at 560 WQM.

[02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:20.820]
The Dow is up to 177.

[02:20:20.820 --> 02:20:21.120]
177.

[02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:22.960]
How many certificates have we got?

[02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:23.420]
I have 63.

[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:25.040]
Last time I checked.

[02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:28.180]
Oh, I could look, but I'm afraid.

[02:20:28.180 --> 02:20:29.700]
Just the copper pot is the guy from Goonies.

[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:30.540]
I never saw Goonies.

[02:20:30.740 --> 02:20:32.060]
He checked the copper pot is the penguin.

[02:20:33.060 --> 02:20:33.360]
Okay.

[02:20:33.500 --> 02:20:37.620]
So somebody said the guy from Goonies, well, that too.

[02:20:41.300 --> 02:20:43.640]
Here is one from Karen.

[02:20:46.020 --> 02:20:49.240]
Sorry, Neil, but I said, tell you, women get really hairy when we're young, but

[02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:50.080]
B-U-T-T.

[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:53.000]
As we get older, we begin to loose our hair in various places.

[02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:53.380]
Really?

[02:20:54.140 --> 02:20:57.200]
I would imagine each person has a different gene determining hair loss according to their

[02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:03.220]
race, sincerely, Karen and her 80-70-year-old hairless mother, and no, she is not a Chihuahua.

[02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:08.720]
By the way, don't go to Mexico.

[02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:09.820]
Okay.

[02:21:10.900 --> 02:21:13.940]
So you see the way that people are getting slaughtered there butchered like?

[02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:14.240]
Yeah.

[02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:17.520]
And all these stupid college kids going to Cancun, you know, for spring break?

[02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:18.500]
Give me a break.

[02:21:18.500 --> 02:21:19.220]
What's up with that?

[02:21:19.380 --> 02:21:20.000]
Read a newspaper.

[02:21:20.300 --> 02:21:21.360]
Look at a newscast.

[02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:25.960]
Find out what's going on in the world before you take off or your good time.

[02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:27.380]
It could be your last good time.

[02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:27.800]
Right.

[02:21:29.500 --> 02:21:30.900]
They're butchering everybody in Mexico.

[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:32.160]
It's not a third world country.

[02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:33.360]
It's like a tenth world country.

[02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:37.740]
Here's one that says, hello, Neil.

[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:38.520]
Hope you're doing good.

[02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:42.920]
Just wanted to say I've been listening to you for over a bunch of years.

[02:21:43.060 --> 02:21:43.640]
It's chopped off.

[02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:44.440]
I wish I knew how many.

[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:48.920]
I could go back and look at it again and I can tell how many.

[02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:50.240]
But does it make any difference?

[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:50.520]
No.

[02:21:51.740 --> 02:21:53.780]
I like to listen to you, show, but only when you're working.

[02:21:53.900 --> 02:21:54.600]
Nothing against George.

[02:21:54.600 --> 02:21:55.100]
He's okay.

[02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:58.680]
But he hasn't put enough time in life as yet to have the attitude he has.

[02:22:00.540 --> 02:22:01.340]
What does that mean?

[02:22:01.940 --> 02:22:03.800]
Well, I guess I'm not old enough to have this attitude.

[02:22:05.540 --> 02:22:06.560]
Anyway, enough about George.

[02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:07.880]
He's an okay guy, says somebody.

[02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:10.320]
I like that you say it like it is.

[02:22:10.420 --> 02:22:14.060]
For sure, you say a lot of things I want to say, but at times I'm afraid to say it.

[02:22:14.060 --> 02:22:17.520]
A lot of people think you're bad, but that's because deep inside they know what you say is true.

[02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:18.660]
Keep up the great work.

[02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:20.460]
Says somebody.

[02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:23.360]
Thank you, somebody, wherever you are.

[02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:28.880]
Oh, and here's a stellar, great email made my day, my week, my month, my life.

[02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:33.300]
Remember one of the original list of John ZTR.

[02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:34.360]
Fakes was Mahatma Gandhi.

[02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:35.120]
Yes.

[02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:39.080]
Well, this one is from Mahatma Gandhi subject to fond farewell.

[02:22:41.660 --> 02:22:45.780]
This is John ZTR and he'll I won't write it anymore, not even using fake accounts.

[02:22:46.660 --> 02:22:48.880]
My reign is the fake email King has come to an end.

[02:22:49.860 --> 02:22:52.700]
Quite frankly, it's boring and so is the new email format for your show.

[02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:57.520]
Oh, whoever you think I am, you are wrong.

[02:22:57.840 --> 02:23:01.760]
I doubt I'm the only person in Florida who hates the...

[02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:02.520]
Crowds.

[02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:04.820]
Tell George not to worry if I have any good movies.

[02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:05.980]
I'll send them his way.

[02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:07.240]
Anyway, take care, Neil.

[02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:10.980]
PS, don't be surprised to finish megal stuff's emailing your show.

[02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:16.360]
See I chase everybody away sooner or later the great John ZTR I chased him away.

[02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:16.800]
I doubt it.

[02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:17.240]
Fat chance.

[02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:18.860]
Fat chance.

[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:19.000]
Right.

[02:23:19.740 --> 02:23:20.760]
Do you believe he's going away?

[02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:21.060]
No.

[02:23:24.140 --> 02:23:27.460]
So I guess we'll know if we keep getting any more emails from the fake time, jick and

[02:23:27.460 --> 02:23:28.620]
the fake of this one and that one.

[02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:34.300]
Oswald copper, cobbled, cobbled pauses the penguin guy.

[02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:35.280]
Says Karne.

[02:23:36.420 --> 02:23:37.720]
Oswald, cobbled pots?

[02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:44.300]
Oh my god.

[02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:50.120]
Some of you folks mean well, but the crap that you write is just...

[02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:52.620]
Generally, you get the absolute worst service at blank.

[02:23:52.740 --> 02:23:53.220]
That's our poll.

[02:23:53.900 --> 02:23:54.540]
Walmart 35.

[02:23:55.340 --> 02:23:57.380]
The DMV Department of Motor Vehicles 30.

[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.080]
The post-orifice right on their heels 25.

[02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:01.460]
And those are both late editions.

[02:24:04.640 --> 02:24:07.100]
Kmart 23 is Kmart still open anywhere?

[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:08.280]
Oh yeah, all over.

[02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:09.680]
Come on.

[02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:10.240]
Okay.

[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:12.280]
There's still is a Kmart somewhere?

[02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:12.640]
Sure.

[02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:14.260]
Everywhere.

[02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:16.480]
Not on university drive and sunrise.

[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:17.620]
That one's been long gone.

[02:24:17.720 --> 02:24:17.940]
Okay.

[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:18.940]
I don't know what's going on.

[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:19.660]
There's some crap there.

[02:24:19.980 --> 02:24:20.380]
Not close.

[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.320]
He buys his clothes at Kmart.

[02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:26.520]
He's a slob.

[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:28.160]
It wouldn't be something.

[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:29.140]
Adventure megal disappeared.

[02:24:29.340 --> 02:24:30.240]
How the hell can we go on?

[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:31.300]
I don't know.

[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:35.180]
Then at least we could eat on the ear and peace without all these lecturers.

[02:24:35.320 --> 02:24:36.420]
Oh, you're disgusting.

[02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:37.740]
I went to etiquette school.

[02:24:38.300 --> 02:24:40.820]
First of all, what kind of person goes to etiquette school anyway?

[02:24:40.980 --> 02:24:42.380]
What kind of an idiot, especially a guy?

[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:46.620]
Yeah, is that a manly thing to go to etiquette school?

[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:48.720]
It sounds a little bit gay to me.

[02:24:48.940 --> 02:24:49.600]
I went to root in the school.

[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:50.740]
What?

[02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:52.540]
I went to root in this school.

[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:59.880]
Kmart 23 Home Depot 19, Best Buy 14, KFC 10, Denny's 9, McDonald's 9,

[02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:04.480]
Burger King 8, Taco Bell 6, Lowe's 5, Radio Shack 4,

[02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:08.380]
Stake and Shake 4, IHOP 3, Target 3, and Wendy's None.

[02:25:11.420 --> 02:25:13.060]
Oh, maybe they've improved.

[02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:16.240]
And of course, worst service doesn't necessarily just mean slow.

[02:25:17.380 --> 02:25:19.900]
When you're talking about a fast food joint and the drive through means,

[02:25:20.220 --> 02:25:21.940]
are they actually going to give you anything that you order?

[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:24.480]
Are you going to get a bag full of stuff that you don't even recognize?

[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:26.180]
A bag full of that.

[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:27.240]
Random crap.

[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:28.380]
Right.

[02:25:29.460 --> 02:25:33.140]
Nothing like ordering a double cheeseburger with onions and ketchup,

[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:38.420]
driving out, opening up the bag, and you've got a fish sandwich with mayonnaise and something.

[02:25:39.100 --> 02:25:39.460]
Lettuce.

[02:25:40.540 --> 02:25:42.120]
And by the way, mayonnaise is for goyem.

[02:25:42.780 --> 02:25:43.420]
Yeah, what's your point?

[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:47.100]
They're always pushing mayonnaise, mayonnaise.

[02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:47.720]
No, they have bacon.

[02:25:47.820 --> 02:25:49.040]
They have bacon-aise now.

[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:50.600]
Mayonnaise.

[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:51.020]
Do they really?

[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:52.180]
Oh, yeah, I can't wait to get something.

[02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:53.240]
That sounds good.

[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:55.260]
Do they really have that or just made the whole they do?

[02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:56.120]
I don't want to get it.

[02:25:56.120 --> 02:25:57.540]
M mayonnaise with bacon bits in it.

[02:25:57.740 --> 02:25:59.440]
I presume that's what it is.

[02:25:59.660 --> 02:26:00.880]
Like I said, the Jews like that.

[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:03.260]
Oh, rooster chuchu.

[02:26:04.020 --> 02:26:09.160]
If I hear you eating on here one more time, I'll go up there to your gay Canadian love nest and kick your GD teeth in.

[02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:10.320]
Rooster chuchu.

[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:12.640]
Wow.

[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:13.720]
Oh.

[02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:18.940]
Phil Arck, were they long, well, not that long, but long enough to take up a couple of minutes.

[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:19.320]
Let's go.

[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:19.900]
Thank you, Phil.

[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:22.760]
This is one of those guys.

[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:24.720]
He's either like you were saying before.

[02:26:25.180 --> 02:26:27.240]
One day he loves the next day he hates.

[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:28.480]
He can't make up his mind.

[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:29.260]
He's all over the place.

[02:26:31.460 --> 02:26:34.160]
Scott says, Chester Cobblepot was the penguin.

[02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:34.920]
Cobblepot.

[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:35.460]
Yes.

[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:36.920]
That's not what that thing is.

[02:26:37.020 --> 02:26:39.200]
Chester Cobblepot is the guy from the goonies.

[02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:40.420]
From the goons?

[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:41.240]
Needs.

[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:42.440]
Goonies?

[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:44.000]
Yep.

[02:26:44.220 --> 02:26:45.980]
I wonder if goonies make a duty.

[02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:46.980]
Probably.

[02:26:47.660 --> 02:26:48.060]
Kakka.

[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:52.600]
Well, I saw a movie last night and I can't think of any of it on one of the on the screen TV.

[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:54.660]
One of those teen slasher movies.

[02:26:54.980 --> 02:26:57.180]
Boy, there was some real interesting people in that.

[02:26:58.780 --> 02:26:59.140]
Wow.

[02:26:59.420 --> 02:27:00.460]
You know what I mean by real interesting?

[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:01.040]
Yeah, I do.

[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:02.440]
Not.

[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:05.520]
Not even just hot, smoldering.

[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:09.180]
By the way, baconase.com, if you want to read all of that.

[02:27:09.260 --> 02:27:09.960]
I don't eat mayonnaise.

[02:27:10.180 --> 02:27:10.840]
I don't like mayonnaise.

[02:27:11.060 --> 02:27:12.280]
Yeah, but what if we put some bacon in it?

[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:13.900]
I don't care what you put in it.

[02:27:13.940 --> 02:27:15.200]
Okay, you can put some duty in it.

[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:16.260]
I'm not eating no mayonnaise.

[02:27:17.140 --> 02:27:18.280]
Oh, there's the shamwag.

[02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:18.960]
Check this fun.

[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:20.540]
The regular towel doesn't work wet.

[02:27:20.780 --> 02:27:22.180]
This works wet or dry.

[02:27:22.180 --> 02:27:23.220]
This is for the house.

[02:27:23.620 --> 02:27:24.020]
The house.

[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:24.680]
The boat.

[02:27:25.140 --> 02:27:25.620]
The RV.

[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:28.360]
The shamwag holds 12 times its weight in liquid.

[02:27:28.580 --> 02:27:28.960]
Look at this.

[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:30.040]
It just does the work.

[02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:31.540]
Why do you want to work twice as hard?

[02:27:31.780 --> 02:27:32.180]
It doesn't trip.

[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:33.520]
It doesn't make a mess.

[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:34.500]
You bring it out.

[02:27:34.740 --> 02:27:36.000]
You wash it in the washing machine.

[02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:36.700]
Made in Germany.

[02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:38.120]
You know the Germans always make good stuff.

[02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:42.620]
Yeah, they share and know how to make a good gas.

[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:43.160]
I'll take that.

[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:49.180]
And when you go and you take the train into Cologne, Germany.

[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:51.620]
And you go over the river.

[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:52.940]
I forget what the name of the river is.

[02:27:53.780 --> 02:27:55.460]
And you pass right by the bear factory.

[02:27:55.580 --> 02:27:58.120]
And that's where they made all that poison gas during WW2.

[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:03.160]
Really made my ass burn.

[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:03.960]
Let me tell you that.

[02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:07.080]
Only in the banana republic, baby.

[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:08.080]
Only in Miami.

[02:28:14.180 --> 02:28:16.480]
Those hot football pubes in Miami are smart.

[02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:18.460]
They changed the name too.

[02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:19.420]
Alien heart.

[02:28:19.620 --> 02:28:20.960]
Exploration is out.

[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:23.020]
Down to a fine heart.

[02:28:24.100 --> 02:28:25.580]
That's where the fuck's hard.

[02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:27.880]
Get your pants out and laugh the road way.

[02:28:28.420 --> 02:28:30.740]
Until you see the human game.

[02:28:30.980 --> 02:28:34.360]
And giant water right where you grab a droopy raft.

[02:28:35.460 --> 02:28:38.880]
And I take your flocking up to a democracy.

[02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:40.280]
Down.

[02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:42.240]
Back south to the view.

[02:28:42.500 --> 02:28:42.900]
Down.

[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:45.860]
Underwater to drown and back around.

[02:28:45.860 --> 02:28:48.140]
To work the rough little town.

[02:28:48.580 --> 02:28:50.520]
The answer big is park you river sea.

[02:28:51.220 --> 02:28:53.420]
Down to the nature all the toilets are clean.

[02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:54.780]
The tide is out of wrap.

[02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:57.100]
Like a big shot media star.

[02:28:57.840 --> 02:28:59.440]
And then a park you're a car.

[02:28:59.980 --> 02:29:02.160]
It's all about how important you feel.

[02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:04.820]
When the rest of the country takes its own baby.

[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:06.240]
For it causes your tongue.

[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:08.540]
Start down to alien heart.

[02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:11.060]
Hey, it's gonna be a glitch.

[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:30.380]
There's a giant deer from the road coach band.

[02:29:30.960 --> 02:29:32.980]
And rockin' music by La Fanda.

[02:29:33.540 --> 02:29:34.820]
Politicians transdans.

[02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:36.860]
Eighteen thirds advance.

[02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:39.180]
Under a coffee cloud.

[02:29:39.740 --> 02:29:41.820]
I place the rodents when the crowd late plays.

[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:44.420]
Back to it made by having what it is today.

[02:29:44.700 --> 02:29:45.840]
That's far me coilets at 10.

[02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:48.360]
They now call alien heart.

[02:29:49.420 --> 02:29:51.100]
Oh, alien alien heart.

[02:29:52.160 --> 02:29:53.840]
Oh, alien alien heart.

[02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:55.220]
This has got a long fade.

[02:29:55.800 --> 02:29:57.060]
Well, good talk of it.

[02:29:57.620 --> 02:29:59.600]
Kind of like always look on a bright side.

[02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:01.180]
Give us the swath of what it has.

[02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:07.920]
I love it.

[02:30:08.480 --> 02:30:09.220]
Do you love it?

[02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:10.460]
Cha, cha, cha.

[02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:13.240]
132.560.

[02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:13.800]
Nobody can hear me.

[02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:14.260]
I like that guy.

[02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:14.540]
Who?

[02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:15.120]
That guy.

[02:30:15.400 --> 02:30:15.800]
I like that guy.

[02:30:15.800 --> 02:30:15.820]
I like that guy.

[02:30:15.820 --> 02:30:15.820]

[02:30:15.820 --> 02:30:15.820]

[02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:17.520]
That's like a jubin.

[02:30:19.140 --> 02:30:21.780]
Tony says that show needs the one on David Road Extension.

[02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:23.800]
It is currently close for renovation.

[02:30:24.020 --> 02:30:26.180]
Hopefully they had plenty of lights when it finished real dark.

[02:30:26.820 --> 02:30:29.440]
Now, I don't know if Tony's talking about the interior or the client tell.

[02:30:29.660 --> 02:30:30.400]
I'm not really sure.

[02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:31.520]
I'm probably better out.

[02:30:31.600 --> 02:30:32.060]
I don't know.

[02:30:33.180 --> 02:30:33.900]
Don't you think?

[02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:34.460]
Yeah.

[02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:35.600]
Don't ask.

[02:30:36.020 --> 02:30:36.380]
Don't tell.

[02:30:36.980 --> 02:30:37.700]
And he won't tell.

[02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:43.260]
David says, well, it's the good thing these things trickle in here.

[02:30:43.260 --> 02:30:45.460]
Just enough to keep us going until two o'clock.

[02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:50.920]
So you don't understand the way this is working out has been not perfect but pretty damn close to it.

[02:30:52.580 --> 02:30:54.620]
And you and your negative hostile.

[02:30:54.900 --> 02:30:56.980]
Oh, I think you're John ZTR.

[02:30:58.160 --> 02:30:59.040]
You're finally.

[02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:00.400]
You're finally.

[02:31:00.480 --> 02:31:05.040]
You're always the email format sucks is because we don't have enough real people like David in the way anywhere.

[02:31:05.260 --> 02:31:06.620]
And we have too many fakers.

[02:31:06.740 --> 02:31:07.180]
Amen.

[02:31:07.440 --> 02:31:08.760]
Well, don't don't blame me for that.

[02:31:09.040 --> 02:31:09.600]
I don't.

[02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:12.880]
In the beginning, we had like we had emailers up the S.

[02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:13.080]
Right.

[02:31:13.120 --> 02:31:13.540]
Splattering.

[02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:15.780]
That's right.

[02:31:16.660 --> 02:31:18.440]
It was like, oh my god.

[02:31:18.580 --> 02:31:22.280]
All these people I want to say something that yada yada yada like that.

[02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:27.640]
Oh, Piusz, the analyst pushing for gives me some came art information.

[02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:30.500]
And he sends me a picture of some guy who's supposedly hot.

[02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:31.560]
I don't know who this is.

[02:31:32.820 --> 02:31:34.280]
Who looks really marginal.

[02:31:35.260 --> 02:31:37.720]
Oh, it's Ryan Philippi.

[02:31:37.720 --> 02:31:39.200]
Boy, you sure don't look good in that picture.

[02:31:39.320 --> 02:31:39.840]
Ryan Philippi.

[02:31:40.300 --> 02:31:41.720]
And so worst picture ever seen him.

[02:31:41.860 --> 02:31:43.060]
And boy, it's hard to make him look bad.

[02:31:44.720 --> 02:31:46.220]
Even George would agree with that.

[02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:50.080]
I'm not going to just.

[02:31:50.180 --> 02:31:52.960]
Mister poopy pants and fees frustrate flyers.

[02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:56.540]
Mister poopy pants.

[02:31:56.600 --> 02:31:57.420]
Well, maybe I'll get to that.

[02:31:57.500 --> 02:31:57.860]
Maybe not.

[02:31:57.920 --> 02:31:58.260]
I don't know.

[02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:00.040]
And I still don't have any entries for tomorrow.

[02:32:00.660 --> 02:32:02.120]
I got an email for Gulfstream that.

[02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:03.660]
Is it Ron Nickeletti?

[02:32:03.980 --> 02:32:04.340]
Yeah.

[02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:07.940]
We're supposed to send you this week's and he is on it.

[02:32:09.460 --> 02:32:11.140]
He sent me last week's again.

[02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:13.580]
Yeah, I'm okay with anybody be that much of a bozo.

[02:32:13.880 --> 02:32:14.520]
I told Steve that.

[02:32:15.060 --> 02:32:16.000]
And what did he say?

[02:32:16.660 --> 02:32:17.900]
Should have sent this week's.

[02:32:17.900 --> 02:32:18.920]
Oi, they I will follow.

[02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:19.500]
He didn't do it.

[02:32:19.680 --> 02:32:20.720]
Didn't do it, Steve.

[02:32:23.020 --> 02:32:23.460]
God.

[02:32:24.920 --> 02:32:26.380]
Let me check that thing.

[02:32:32.520 --> 02:32:32.920]
Oh.

[02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:38.680]
Let's go to WQM.com.

[02:32:38.820 --> 02:32:41.140]
Shall we click on the EO deal under a Near Roger show?

[02:32:41.660 --> 02:32:42.460]
57 last time I checked.

[02:32:44.140 --> 02:32:46.380]
77 56 them 56 Q 56.

[02:32:47.300 --> 02:32:47.900]
How do you like that?

[02:32:49.040 --> 02:32:49.840]
Q 56.

[02:32:50.600 --> 02:32:51.260]
That's us.

[02:32:52.220 --> 02:32:53.080]
Well, we'll get there.

[02:32:53.120 --> 02:32:54.040]
It's going to take a couple of days.

[02:32:54.160 --> 02:32:55.240]
We'll get the gittermal sold.

[02:32:56.420 --> 02:32:58.880]
The $225 things is kind of like, I don't know.

[02:32:59.840 --> 02:33:00.940]
It is what it is.

[02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:02.980]
You know, there it is and good luck to you.

[02:33:04.820 --> 02:33:06.160]
Is that the best way to look at it?

[02:33:06.400 --> 02:33:06.580]
Yes.

[02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:08.000]
It is what it is.

[02:33:08.140 --> 02:33:08.740]
We do the best we can.

[02:33:10.540 --> 02:33:12.620]
A few slow animals pussyfooter informs us.

[02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:13.800]
I'll get back to David in a minute.

[02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:16.900]
Kmart Corp went into chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2002.

[02:33:17.560 --> 02:33:19.780]
They closed over a third of their stores and many areas

[02:33:19.780 --> 02:33:20.800]
where they had multiple stores.

[02:33:20.880 --> 02:33:23.040]
They left one or two of the best performing stores open.

[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:24.080]
Close the rest.

[02:33:25.600 --> 02:33:28.980]
One location bar there means open is Pembroke Pines east of

[02:33:28.980 --> 02:33:29.680]
Hyetus Road.

[02:33:33.860 --> 02:33:36.660]
The owner of Kmart later required Sir's Robuck and the

[02:33:36.660 --> 02:33:40.400]
combined company is called Sir's Holdings, which explains why

[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:43.500]
Kenmore appliances and craftsmen tools cannot be found at Kmart.

[02:33:44.200 --> 02:33:47.160]
In closing, completely unrelated to Kmart but important

[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:49.700]
nonetheless, here's a gratuitous photo of Ryan Philippi on a

[02:33:49.700 --> 02:33:50.700]
movie set in South Africa.

[02:33:51.140 --> 02:33:52.700]
It says, my, my, he's aging well.

[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:54.200]
Not in that picture he's not.

[02:33:54.860 --> 02:33:55.200]
Peepee.

[02:33:58.180 --> 02:33:59.120]
Oh, here's the picture.

[02:33:59.180 --> 02:34:00.200]
Boy, print it out the whole picture.

[02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:00.980]
He don't look good there.

[02:34:01.540 --> 02:34:02.380]
He looks bad.

[02:34:03.140 --> 02:34:04.620]
It doesn't even look anything like him.

[02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:07.960]
Probably an imposter like you.

[02:34:08.020 --> 02:34:10.120]
Maybe it's John's ETR from Who Knows.

[02:34:10.660 --> 02:34:11.060]
He's everywhere.

[02:34:13.060 --> 02:34:16.680]
Although I have noticed that since all this chub I went on today

[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:18.960]
haven't we only had one from the fake Larry King.

[02:34:19.340 --> 02:34:23.600]
I didn't have one from the real Adam Kirschner with a picture

[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:24.340]
of him in his dog.

[02:34:25.380 --> 02:34:25.740]
Yeah.

[02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:28.940]
But it said something really stupid and I, I deleted it.

[02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:30.580]
Okay.

[02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:33.360]
Anybody can go on somebody's like my space or Facebook and grab

[02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:35.740]
somebody's picture and then send you something pretend to be

[02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:35.920]
them.

[02:34:36.180 --> 02:34:36.560]
That's right.

[02:34:36.620 --> 02:34:39.000]
And by the way, we don't have a Facebook page associated with

[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.080]
this show and we don't have a Twitter.

[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:44.140]
No, no, Adam's really in the dress if there's ever any doubt.

[02:34:44.820 --> 02:34:45.300]
Okay.

[02:34:47.300 --> 02:34:48.960]
The real Adam Kirschner.

[02:34:50.260 --> 02:34:51.800]
He was still working for the Sun Central.

[02:34:51.860 --> 02:34:53.740]
But I sure hope they don't got a business just for his sake.

[02:34:54.780 --> 02:34:57.280]
A newspaper that prints four pages every day can't be much of a

[02:34:57.280 --> 02:35:00.140]
newspaper, but nevertheless it's not your time's cutting staff.

[02:35:00.860 --> 02:35:01.680]
Chicago Tribune.

[02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:04.600]
Everybody's going out of business radio stations TV stations,

[02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:06.500]
newspapers, auto makers.

[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:09.800]
Everybody's going out of business and just it just happened like

[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:10.260]
overnight.

[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:12.400]
Everything was going along.

[02:35:12.400 --> 02:35:14.260]
We're singing a song and then boom by the Bing.

[02:35:14.660 --> 02:35:14.940]
Boom.

[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:16.720]
And you least expect that everybody was broke.

[02:35:18.180 --> 02:35:20.420]
If they would just sell those Priuses for about a hundred bucks

[02:35:20.420 --> 02:35:20.880]
a piece.

[02:35:21.260 --> 02:35:21.580]
Wow.

[02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:22.220]
I'd buy two.

[02:35:22.320 --> 02:35:23.060]
I have a lot of problems.

[02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:24.980]
Yeah, then you could actually buy one for you.

[02:35:26.540 --> 02:35:28.940]
I think Joe Bell ought to buy you a car out of his own pocket.

[02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:29.320]
That's funny.

[02:35:30.980 --> 02:35:31.520]
What do you mean?

[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:33.020]
That's funny.

[02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:33.900]
I'm not joking.

[02:35:34.040 --> 02:35:34.540]
I'm being serial.

[02:35:35.940 --> 02:35:38.920]
I think he ought to dig deep into his fat wallet and you know,

[02:35:39.020 --> 02:35:40.220]
he's probably making a few bucks.

[02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:45.860]
Lord asked like him, you know, the management types are the last ones to take the cuts.

[02:35:45.860 --> 02:35:48.980]
You see this with these CEOs in their golden parachutes and all the crap.

[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:55.080]
In fact, let's take Joe up about 37,000 feet and give him a golden parachute and tell him to jump.

[02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:57.000]
Then that's how I can plan.

[02:35:57.360 --> 02:35:57.460]
Okay.

[02:35:58.140 --> 02:35:58.900]
Oh, I like it.

[02:36:00.660 --> 02:36:01.960]
David says I live in Northern Virginia.

[02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:05.140]
In this area there are plenty of older buildings that have to be switched from heat to coolness

[02:36:05.140 --> 02:36:05.580]
to springtime.

[02:36:06.260 --> 02:36:10.440]
You went up sweating to death in the late spring until the maintenance crew comes around to make the swish.

[02:36:11.020 --> 02:36:14.300]
In the late fall, you end up freezing your ass off till they come around to make switch to heat.

[02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:18.160]
I finally got fed up with this and moved to a newer building that didn't have that problem.

[02:36:18.620 --> 02:36:19.820]
Maybe you live in an older building?

[02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:22.420]
I think this building is like, I don't know, 10 or 12 years old, not that old.

[02:36:23.460 --> 02:36:25.580]
All in all, I would not trade this area for South Florida.

[02:36:25.980 --> 02:36:28.320]
I lived there for 20 years until I moved out five years ago.

[02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:31.140]
I like seeing the seasons change and people are much friendlier.

[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:35.900]
I don't miss the old parts bashing me in the ankles with their shopping carts at publics

[02:36:35.900 --> 02:36:38.420]
or the mummies who drive around to their motorized scooters.

[02:36:39.020 --> 02:36:42.860]
In our old condo, an old lady had a stroke while driving one of those in a parking lot

[02:36:42.860 --> 02:36:46.400]
and a scooter kept going until it smashed against the fence around the pool.

[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:47.160]
What a place.

[02:36:47.780 --> 02:36:48.620]
Take care, David.

[02:36:49.220 --> 02:36:50.140]
And God bless America.

[02:36:50.900 --> 02:36:51.580]
God bless Canada.

[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:52.780]
Oh, Canada.

[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:54.980]
The leaves, they really suck.

[02:36:55.240 --> 02:36:56.180]
They won a game last night.

[02:36:56.180 --> 02:36:56.780]
They mean Philadelphia.

[02:36:57.180 --> 02:36:58.520]
Right at the air Canada center.

[02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:00.140]
Any interest?

[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:00.960]
Anybody care?

[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:01.320]
No.

[02:37:01.420 --> 02:37:02.240]
Panthers got a shot.

[02:37:02.420 --> 02:37:04.100]
They got the Rangers that are falling badly.

[02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:06.380]
And of course Montreal, they're right at Montreal's ass.

[02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:08.120]
Oh, there's Leafs TV.

[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:13.020]
My question is, what's going through your head in that little time period between the trade

[02:37:13.020 --> 02:37:14.500]
and you actually getting picked?

[02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:16.900]
I didn't have a great idea.

[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:22.420]
I thought, you know, there's obviously some still real good players left available to pick there

[02:37:22.420 --> 02:37:23.480]
at the five spot.

[02:37:23.640 --> 02:37:24.860]
And I know it got me around that.

[02:37:24.860 --> 02:37:25.360]
That's it.

[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:29.800]
I was a little bit of an idea, but still wasn't 100% sure just because of...

[02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:32.000]
Looks a little bit like Luke Shen, but it's not my boy Luke.

[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:32.580]
I'll tell you that.

[02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:34.120]
Luke's a lot better looking than that.

[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:36.060]
You know Luke Shen number two, Maple Leafs?

[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:36.240]
No.

[02:37:37.460 --> 02:37:38.460]
He's a pretty guy.

[02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:40.920]
Oh, a turf way.

[02:37:41.020 --> 02:37:42.840]
I'm actually this is Mike Bataglia.

[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:47.720]
For the lead, for the lead on the outside.

[02:37:48.140 --> 02:37:50.440]
Oh, he's just, he's so bushly, he gets pathetic.

[02:37:51.540 --> 02:37:52.240]
The worst.

[02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:53.260]
Mike Bataglia.

[02:37:55.620 --> 02:37:57.140]
But he used to bring his name up to Hanky.

[02:37:57.240 --> 02:37:59.660]
He's a very nice man, which is a way of saying, hey, you're right, he sucks.

[02:38:01.060 --> 02:38:02.040]
There's a lot of nice people.

[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:03.180]
It doesn't mean they can call a race.

[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:04.960]
And they're off.

[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:06.180]
Come on, let's go.

[02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:08.940]
Maybe you could pick a winner here, turf way park.

[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:09.860]
Number five.

[02:38:10.620 --> 02:38:11.140]
There's nine more.

[02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:11.920]
There are a post.

[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:12.560]
There are the boughs.

[02:38:12.660 --> 02:38:13.020]
That's him.

[02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:15.620]
It's the horrible, just grotesque.

[02:38:16.100 --> 02:38:17.340]
I got the five horse.

[02:38:17.500 --> 02:38:20.020]
One of the way from the gate slowly was a four-daleed.

[02:38:20.020 --> 02:38:22.680]
The silver breaking sharply on the inside.

[02:38:22.980 --> 02:38:23.300]
Ribbit.

[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:24.060]
Ribbit.

[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:28.720]
Then from the outside, this is first formal etiquette from between horses.

[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:30.060]
Horse is next.

[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:31.520]

[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:31.920]
And up front.

[02:38:31.940 --> 02:38:32.980]
Oh, he, you know something?

[02:38:33.140 --> 02:38:34.100]
I just get physically ill.

[02:38:34.100 --> 02:38:35.080]
I can't listen to that man.

[02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:36.180]
He's just the worst.

[02:38:36.580 --> 02:38:37.660]
Something I'm not going to find out if I would.

[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:41.680]
In life, there are, there are people who are the best of what they do.

[02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:43.780]
And there are people who are the worst at what they do.

[02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:44.900]
Oh, new.

[02:38:45.580 --> 02:38:47.640]
Grab my junior, honey.

[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:49.660]
Hi, y'all.

[02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:52.880]
It's me, Britney Spears, with an all new blog update.

[02:38:52.880 --> 02:38:54.900]
And an effort to change my ways.

[02:38:55.300 --> 02:38:58.260]
I've recently become more involved in charity work.

[02:38:58.420 --> 02:39:01.000]
And even enlisted the help of my pastor.

[02:39:01.380 --> 02:39:02.540]
He's here with me now.

[02:39:02.840 --> 02:39:05.180]
He's my spiritual guide, y'all.

[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:06.560]
Yes, Miss Spears.

[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:09.020]
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

[02:39:09.340 --> 02:39:12.400]
And right now, he's telling me that you're f***ing hanging up.

[02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:12.980]
What?

[02:39:13.620 --> 02:39:14.760]
That's so cool.

[02:39:15.140 --> 02:39:16.420]
You speak to the Lord?

[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:17.760]
Awesome.

[02:39:18.660 --> 02:39:19.880]
I'm excuse me, Britney.

[02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:21.640]
The blind children of America charity

[02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:24.720]
are working with one of their contest winners here for a meet and greet.

[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:25.880]
Well, send them in.

[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:26.920]
Okay, cool.

[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:28.140]
Hey, there.

[02:39:28.300 --> 02:39:29.380]
Nice to meet you.

[02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:32.040]
Wow, you're such a cute little blind person.

[02:39:32.780 --> 02:39:35.320]
Whoa, whoa, is your f***ing house?

[02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:36.420]
Oh, hold on.

[02:39:37.380 --> 02:39:38.820]
Wow, how did you know?

[02:39:39.300 --> 02:39:40.120]
Oh, I can tell.

[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:41.920]
Trust me.

[02:39:42.180 --> 02:39:43.200]
Oh, well, well.

[02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:46.660]
All right, I've got to get back to my path of self-discovery.

[02:39:47.060 --> 02:39:49.500]
Until next time, TTY, y'all.

[02:39:50.060 --> 02:39:51.200]
Yeah, back catch it.

[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:51.540]
You back?

[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:52.520]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:53.160]
Oh, good.

[02:39:54.420 --> 02:39:56.400]
Here's the good news and bad news.

[02:39:56.560 --> 02:39:56.840]
Okay.

[02:39:57.180 --> 02:40:01.320]
The good news is that Rhonda Caliddy facts me the email, me the stuff.

[02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:01.860]
Okay.

[02:40:02.380 --> 02:40:03.340]
You want to hear the bad news?

[02:40:03.580 --> 02:40:04.680]
It's the last week's again.

[02:40:05.180 --> 02:40:05.360]
No.

[02:40:05.700 --> 02:40:06.260]
It's the right one.

[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:06.920]
Okay.

[02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:13.760]
It's two and a half furlongs, made in a special way, seven two-year-olds that have never run a race before.

[02:40:16.060 --> 02:40:16.460]
Okay.

[02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:20.500]
In other words, one good lock handy capping that one.

[02:40:20.540 --> 02:40:21.060]
Is that what you're saying?

[02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:22.600]
That's exactly what I'm saying.

[02:40:23.020 --> 02:40:24.860]
They've got the two-year-olds started now, Gulfstream.

[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:29.440]
And this is a race with all two-year-old maidens, well, maidens because they never ran a race before.

[02:40:29.860 --> 02:40:31.360]
So, all you got to go by is the workouts.

[02:40:32.540 --> 02:40:39.920]
Based on that, my initial, my first, and I'm not picking this, but I'm just saying, my first feeling is the seven Yoguru with Elvis Trujillo,

[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:44.240]
who's got one, two, two bullet works at Gulfstream.

[02:40:46.460 --> 02:40:47.500]
And a whole bunch of workouts.

[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:51.760]
Oh, God.

[02:40:51.980 --> 02:40:54.520]
Well, I'll just set that over there and do the best I can with it.

[02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:57.440]
How do you handicraft a race where nobody has ever run before?

[02:40:57.780 --> 02:40:58.400]
Just throw it dart.

[02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:05.560]
Heath, remember we were trying to think about Heath before trying to think of what that name was?

[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:06.620]
Heath?

[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:07.600]
Heath?

[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:09.760]
The fake emailer.

[02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:11.080]
Yeah, no. Heath Ledger?

[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:12.120]
The Joker?

[02:41:12.980 --> 02:41:13.500]
The ballbuster?

[02:41:14.460 --> 02:41:15.820]
You want me to read his email?

[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:16.220]
No.

[02:41:17.020 --> 02:41:17.740]
Fatal attraction.

[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:18.800]
What about it?

[02:41:19.420 --> 02:41:20.700]
That's what it says, the answer.

[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:24.520]
Just try to be a smart ass from the question we asked about three weeks ago.

[02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:25.600]
Like, we should know, yeah.

[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.100]
Somebody else did that, so right away he jumps on the batter.

[02:41:29.420 --> 02:41:32.560]
Even the, uh, chronics can't, they can't do the original chronics stuff.

[02:41:32.940 --> 02:41:34.740]
They have to rip it off, and they're like Paul and Ron.

[02:41:35.060 --> 02:41:37.900]
By the way, congratulations to Paul and Ron for a big book.

[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:40.800]
Just kicking Bubba to love Spongebob's ass.

[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:45.060]
He went up a little bit before they were, they just, they just kicked big smelly butt.

[02:41:46.020 --> 02:41:46.720]
Paul and Ron.

[02:41:48.460 --> 02:41:51.880]
And boy, when you, when you can get those kind of numbers with the kind of crap they put on here,

[02:41:51.980 --> 02:41:53.300]
you really have accomplished something.

[02:41:55.080 --> 02:41:58.960]
Oh, a morning train says, I have an email you're showing a long time.

[02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:03.060]
I promised you I wouldn't do so ever again and never listen to your show.

[02:42:03.420 --> 02:42:05.640]
However, I just heard you mentioned an email from Rooster 2 2.

[02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:09.120]
I assure you with someone impersonating the real Rooster 2 2,

[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:11.200]
I will now go back and exile from your show, Neil.

[02:42:11.300 --> 02:42:12.380]
George knows that I'm being truthful.

[02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:14.940]
And look at my handle for this email, just ask him.

[02:42:15.380 --> 02:42:16.020]
Morning train.

[02:42:18.340 --> 02:42:19.340]
I don't know what that means.

[02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:21.280]
And it's just double talk.

[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:22.380]
I can't see his hand.

[02:42:22.380 --> 02:42:24.580]
I will never listen to you again, but I just heard you mentioned an email.

[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:27.580]
This is exactly the same as the other stuff from your buddy.

[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:30.320]
John ZTR.

[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:33.400]
Makes no sense.

[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:34.560]
Double talk.

[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:36.520]
But you know what, kill some good time.

[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:37.180]
I like him.

[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:38.120]
See, contrary to you.

[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:42.560]
I like anything that I can actually use on a year and kill a couple of minutes.

[02:42:42.620 --> 02:42:44.040]
That was up to 149 points.

[02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:46.460]
I got my shirt on, my pantaloonies, my shoes.

[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:47.580]
Jess?

[02:42:49.660 --> 02:42:54.100]
Brandon says, show me this is indeed closed for renovations because they cut fire back around Christmas time.

[02:42:54.460 --> 02:42:55.480]
Maybe they'll be open next time.

[02:42:55.560 --> 02:42:57.400]
Here's so you can get some of that strawberry fire you're raved about.

[02:42:57.680 --> 02:42:59.220]
I'm telling you, man, it is the best.

[02:42:59.580 --> 02:43:00.920]
Now, of course, that was a long time ago.

[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:05.640]
That was back in my Detroit days back in the early 70s, late 60s.

[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:08.840]
Because it's a Detroit chain, big boy.

[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.140]
There was Elias Brothers, big boy and Shonees, big boy.

[02:43:11.620 --> 02:43:12.580]
And then, hey, big boy.

[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:18.040]
Randy says earlier, you and George were talking about Godfather's Pizza.

[02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:20.480]
George was talking about the one there on 441.

[02:43:21.020 --> 02:43:21.200]
Yes.

[02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:24.420]
I remember that store and eight there several times, but I can't remember from my life.

[02:43:24.580 --> 02:43:25.260]
Where was it?

[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:26.800]
What cross tree was it?

[02:43:26.900 --> 02:43:28.680]
What's there now when you please ask George?

[02:43:28.980 --> 02:43:29.640]
What's the story, George?

[02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:32.860]
South of 1.09, I think it turned into a tarx.

[02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:33.680]
Clams.

[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:35.220]
And I don't know what it is at the moment.

[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:35.920]
Tarx, clamshark.

[02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:36.820]
A shack.

[02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:37.200]
Yeah.

[02:43:41.300 --> 02:43:43.300]
South of 1.99, north of 1.91.

[02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:44.780]
So somewhere in there.

[02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:51.620]
Oh, Ricardo, aka the fake gym defeated.

[02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:53.360]
When you hear this, you're going to just puke.

[02:43:53.820 --> 02:43:55.060]
If this is true, I don't know.

[02:43:55.660 --> 02:43:59.260]
Maybe he's just an Ojian provacateur trying to stir it up as Joe Rose would say.

[02:43:59.260 --> 02:44:01.480]
Oh, people say I like to stir it up.

[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:03.640]
Stir it up.

[02:44:03.760 --> 02:44:04.500]
Stir it up my ass.

[02:44:04.700 --> 02:44:05.020]
I'm sorry.

[02:44:07.620 --> 02:44:10.500]
Thomas's tells George the percentage of people who would call a radio show more certainly

[02:44:10.500 --> 02:44:12.180]
would be less than people who would email the show.

[02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:14.900]
I for one would never call the show, but obviously email one.

[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:16.120]
I think I'm not the only one.

[02:44:16.460 --> 02:44:18.320]
Maybe this needs to be determined in some type of poll.

[02:44:18.820 --> 02:44:20.660]
By the way, I started listening to you during the Wami days.

[02:44:20.860 --> 02:44:23.120]
I hated you, but that quickly changed for some unknown reason.

[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:25.600]
And now, I must listen to any chance I get thanks for all the laughs.

[02:44:25.900 --> 02:44:26.700]
The real time in Miami.

[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:27.300]
How do you like that?

[02:44:27.300 --> 02:44:29.300]
Thomas hated me like poison.

[02:44:29.300 --> 02:44:29.780]
Wow.

[02:44:29.860 --> 02:44:31.580]
Now it's like, you know, not so much.

[02:44:31.700 --> 02:44:32.780]
You don't hate so much.

[02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:36.260]
Oh, mom, a me.

[02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:40.320]
Ricardo Santana, aka the fake gym defeated.

[02:44:42.940 --> 02:44:45.420]
Says at 790, all the hosts are staying.

[02:44:45.420 --> 02:44:47.300]
They feel sorry for Danny Stahlworth.

[02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:52.720]
Kind of like Hank's stating Cecil Collins just wanted to take a peek.

[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:53.200]
Yeah.

[02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:56.560]
Every time he joked us some aberrant, grotesque, unacceptable thing.

[02:44:58.140 --> 02:45:01.540]
It's like, oh, well, you know, two minutes that Cecil's lament is so short.

[02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:07.420]
I broke in through her bedroom window.

[02:45:07.800 --> 02:45:07.960]
Yeah.

[02:45:08.220 --> 02:45:09.640]
Otherwise it would be good, you know, to go out with.

[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:11.480]
But I don't want to go out with him.

[02:45:12.020 --> 02:45:13.060]
You go out with him.

[02:45:13.220 --> 02:45:13.460]
Not me.

[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:15.780]
Cecil Collins, Cecil Adizel.

[02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:18.680]
Do you want to think about the dolphin organization, man?

[02:45:18.740 --> 02:45:19.820]
They always, they're always capable.

[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:23.180]
They must have like one of those, you know, when you go to the beach and you're

[02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:28.760]
searching for treasure, one of those wands, you know, what are they call those?

[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:29.820]
Metal detector.

[02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:31.780]
Yeah, like a metal detector wand.

[02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:34.100]
Remember Wando?

[02:45:34.980 --> 02:45:35.540]
I remember Horn.

[02:45:35.540 --> 02:45:36.840]
Great Canadian horse Wando.

[02:45:38.340 --> 02:45:42.040]
Won't be long before Woodbind opens this weekend and then you can hear Dan Loiselle.

[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:42.500]
There are.

[02:45:42.860 --> 02:45:43.920]
You love Dan Loiselle.

[02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:44.560]
Yeah, I don't know why.

[02:45:44.900 --> 02:45:46.220]
It's because he's your favorite.

[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:46.420]
Funny.

[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:48.260]
I can't think of any money.

[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:49.180]
It's funny.

[02:45:50.060 --> 02:45:51.900]
Every race starts exactly the same way.

[02:45:51.900 --> 02:45:56.360]
There are, kind of like almost indifferent, like he's telling you, I don't have a bet on this race.

[02:45:57.540 --> 02:45:59.840]
Hey, Neil, getting ready for Iron Maiden tonight at Bank Atlantic.

[02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:03.140]
Finally, a cell out of this arena, plenty of gold, green and lots of TNA.

[02:46:03.300 --> 02:46:03.680]
Come on, George.

[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:05.320]
Let's metal out long live Eddie.

[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:05.940]
Says somebody.

[02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:08.820]
And you say, I'll pass up.

[02:46:09.540 --> 02:46:10.860]
Thanks, but El Paso.

[02:46:11.740 --> 02:46:13.420]
Yeah, I was never that big into Iron Maiden.

[02:46:13.500 --> 02:46:14.700]
Not wrong with them, but just though, you know.

[02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:20.500]
Let's do a whole show tomorrow on the, what's your call?

[02:46:20.500 --> 02:46:21.060]
Altra.

[02:46:21.340 --> 02:46:21.500]
All right.

[02:46:22.220 --> 02:46:25.060]
Let's hit all those naked young people in the studio.

[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:28.360]
Oh, it's Dave.

[02:46:28.540 --> 02:46:28.640]
Wow.

[02:46:29.100 --> 02:46:30.200]
By Ernie Town.

[02:46:30.780 --> 02:46:31.580]
That's absolutely.

[02:46:31.860 --> 02:46:32.980]
At five, six, oh.

[02:46:33.740 --> 02:46:35.420]
WQ, A, N.

[02:46:36.380 --> 02:46:37.620]
All right.

[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:39.960]
La La La La.

[02:46:41.560 --> 02:46:46.180]
La La La La La La La La.

[02:46:46.820 --> 02:47:10.440]
K

[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:13.040]
Where you can play in the mud

[02:47:14.220 --> 02:47:17.460]
We'll pack your beans and add a lot of us

[02:47:17.460 --> 02:47:19.760]
Just go away, we're all fed up

[02:47:21.180 --> 02:47:23.100]
A-li-yongin' dollars

[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:28.020]
Why don't you go home?

[02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:29.700]
A-li-yongin' dollars

[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:32.680]
Go home and leave us all alone

[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:34.900]
If you're lazy, I don't want to go back

[02:47:34.900 --> 02:47:37.380]
I like shopping for free toys better

[02:47:41.860 --> 02:47:46.080]
A-li-yongin' dollars

[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:47.580]
A-li-yongin' dollars

[02:47:47.580 --> 02:47:49.020]
A-li-yongin' dollars

[02:47:49.020 --> 02:47:51.320]
You've got your Pokemon t-shirt

[02:47:52.220 --> 02:47:54.220]
And you're making us ears

[02:47:55.380 --> 02:47:57.660]
You've had your fun, now start packing

[02:47:58.500 --> 02:48:00.800]
So they can get you out of here

[02:48:01.900 --> 02:48:04.460]
It's at the point where we can't stand it

[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:07.420]
Everybody's high enough

[02:48:08.300 --> 02:48:10.580]
We're all the hooligans and crackers

[02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:11.400]
Yes

[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:13.660]
Who put the dust in Florida?

[02:48:15.300 --> 02:48:17.440]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, young comes down less

[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:20.380]
Why don't you go home?

[02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:23.800]
A-li-yongin' dollars

[02:48:24.420 --> 02:48:26.840]
Go home and leave us all alone

[02:48:26.840 --> 02:48:30.840]
If you're lazy, look, they're giving away free SNH green cards

[02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:31.820]
Can I have one?

[02:48:37.420 --> 02:48:46.820]
Bye-bye-bye
