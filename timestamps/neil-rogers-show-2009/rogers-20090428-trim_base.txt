[00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.360]
Yeah, what about that Marlene, huh?

[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.700]
I love that Marlene.

[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.580]
Yes, and cars.

[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.860]
And you're not going to suck those.

[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.860]
The Beastly Drive test is about to be...

[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.000]
How about those Blackhawks?

[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:08.780]
I'm Ride.

[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.160]
You're listening to Sounds Road is for you.

[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.760]
5, 6, and WQAM.

[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.400]
Miami.

[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.860]
For the Lutterdale.

[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.880]
Sorry, it starts out quiet.

[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.240]
Oh, so, it's real low.

[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.380]
Although I can almost speak today.

[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.000]
5, 6, and WQAM.

[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.160]

[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.420]

[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.220]
In other counties, call toll-free, 877-785 Neil,

[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.820]
or pound-five-sixty on your AT&T and Verizon.

[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.060]
Well, as the judge, the opinion's expired.

[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.800]
I heard this.

[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.840]
His guests or his collars do not represent those

[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.540]
of WQAM management, staff, or sponsors.

[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.980]
Now, the Neil Roger Show on 560-WQAM.

[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.260]
Mr. Mary Catherine, Jesus.

[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.140]
That's Jesus El Fisto to you.

[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.500]
See, let's up you some more prisoners.

[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.500]
Make them scream nice and loud.

[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.080]
Get me some wires and a battery pack.

[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.940]
I don't care if they ain't from my rack to be used.

[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.240]
Use you to the torture.

[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.840]
Cause we're just playing their game.

[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.800]
In the past, it had to be worse with the dumb who say.

[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.700]
10-1 at 560-WQAM.

[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.580]
And the last five minutes yesterday show,

[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.200]
I thought I was just going to like get up and walk out.

[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.280]
I thought you were going to die.

[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.480]
No, I just had that mong in the throat where you just can't speak.

[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.760]
You had a flimball you could not get on the other side.

[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.480]
But that is correct.

[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.620]
And here I am and I can speak today, not 100% but about 90, 95.

[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.880]
And I finally realized being slow and stupid and old,

[00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.460]
which I am.

[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340]
This is just another sinus infection.

[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.340]
When I first came up here, first two years I was doing the shows here.

[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.880]
Air of the winter, I get numerous of those episodes.

[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.840]
Coffing and choking, you can't talk,

[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.500]
and you're taking the tea and sucking on the lozenges.

[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.460]
And then I went to see Dr. Hamft on there in a four-lawterdale,

[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.120]
and she got me on deliverquin, and that cleared it right up.

[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.360]
And I haven't had a problem since, and that's what this is.

[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.740]
Oh no, Neon, you've got the Shreinhood flu.

[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.020]
This morning, the first email I opened up from that ass clown

[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.340]
Phil Arck, whoever that guy is, a real jerk.

[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.920]
And you're right.

[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.640]
Now, having seen that movie misery a couple nights ago,

[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.460]
yeah, stalkers is the word.

[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.800]
These people are stalkers.

[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.800]
They want to inject themselves into your life.

[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.780]
They want to tell you how to run your life.

[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.400]
What to do?

[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.740]
He's telling me, oh, you want to be taken tam a flu

[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.800]
when you want to do this and you're old and you're out there.

[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.720]
So concerned about me.

[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.740]
Don't worry Phil, I'll survive without your help.

[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.160]
Mind your, get your own life.

[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.680]
Will you please?

[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.200]
I have no idea.

[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.760]
I'm sure of that.

[00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.060]
I could read it to you, but I deleted it immediately

[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.680]
if not soon.

[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.020]
It's all right.

[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.860]
Same old crap.

[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.320]
Speaking of misery, I saw a movie kind of a counterpart

[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.820]
to Ms. Realized Night, which I've seen,

[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.140]
I don't know, two, three times before.

[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.380]
It's not what you call great day.

[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.540]
It's not spectacular, but it's pretty good.

[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.260]
It's enjoyable, especially because a younger Adam Baldwin

[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.860]
who's not one of the Baldwin brothers.

[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.080]
Right.

[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.480]
He looked pretty good.

[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.980]
And justine Bateman isn't it.

[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.960]
I don't care what you say.

[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.560]
She is me.

[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.540]
Okay.

[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.820]
You think she's hot?

[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.500]
No, no.

[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.040]
She's not even lukewarm justine Bateman.

[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.800]
That's not what I said.

[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.120]
What did you say?

[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.120]
I said, does she get naked?

[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.080]
No.

[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.060]
That's what I said.

[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.120]
And I asked you, why would anybody want to see her naked?

[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.900]
I said, I'll give her a look.

[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.640]
Oh.

[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.860]
That was the conversation.

[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.720]
I'd rather see him naked than her, but then again.

[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.320]
You go ahead and make up what you want from this point on,

[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.720]
but that was the conversation we had.

[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.460]
Okay.

[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.020]
Anyway, it's not bad.

[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.620]
Okay.

[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.140]
I want to watch it.

[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.800]
Even if she doesn't get naked.

[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.880]
It's a little hard press for you to believe that after she,

[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.300]
I mean, I don't want to do a spoiler here, but I will anyway.

[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.700]
Oh, it's okay.

[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.400]
After she's sleeping, he's keeping her prisoner in her apartment.

[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.620]
He's a crazy person like our general manager,

[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.060]
not all, although not that crazy.

[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.800]
And she's a med student.

[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.360]
And she just happens to have in her cabinet a container with botulism.

[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.780]
Okay.

[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.400]
I mean, then everybody, you know, have a little thing of botulism in the cupboard.

[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.000]
I have to.

[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.420]
And she slathers it on his cheesecake, which just coincidentally,

[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.960]
the top of the cheesecake is the same, the strawberry topping on the cheesecake

[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.400]
is the same color as the botulism thing.

[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.660]
It's the only handy that comes in.

[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.780]
And he gets fever, you know, and gets sick.

[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.920]
And she beats him over the head with a lamp.

[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.800]
And he spends one night in the hospital and breaks out and goes and tracks her down.

[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.520]
So that, that part of it's a little bit tough to accept.

[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.600]
Okay.

[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.840]
I'm going to take a strep of seal, strep of seal extra, not take it.

[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.620]
I'm going to suck on it.

[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.000]
Okay.

[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.220]
Okay.

[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.000]
That'll all be right now.

[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.980]
So if I start gagging and coughing again, you know,

[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.800]
we think Niels got the Schfinone flu.

[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.020]
The, the height job that the media are doing on this is so incredibly,

[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.240]
not unexpected, but just grotesque.

[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.400]
Well, I mean, it's not as important as the White House dog.

[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.620]
You saw how much time they spent on that.

[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.200]
Now that's true.

[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.960]
And boy, oh,

[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.380]
the media is sick and they talk badly.

[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.820]
Right.

[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.740]
Good point.

[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.120]
And, you know, the president comes on and says it's reason for concerned,

[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.260]
but not for panic and right away, everybody in the media is getting

[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.620]
everybody whipped up into a panic.

[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.980]
All these dead people in Mexico and yaddy, yaddy, yaddy, and these students

[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.120]
in New York who had just come back from Cancun, Mexico.

[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.180]
My best suggestion to all, and I never gave the update on the,

[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.100]
I told you about it.

[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:54.400]
I was so excited.

[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.860]
I said, you were a text yesterday.

[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.940]
Oh, the package.

[00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.940]
The highly awaited package.

[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.820]
I had an important document in it for Paco.

[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.800]
And it was coming Canada post, a large cardboard envelope,

[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.360]
like a FedEx envelope, exactly the same size.

[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.800]
And here I get this notice.

[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.360]
I go online and track it.

[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.520]
Oh, it was delivered Friday at noon and I go down to the office and it's not there.

[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.480]
They have no record of it.

[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.180]
So yesterday at two o'clock, Paco was so worried about it.

[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.460]
He even took off from school yesterday.

[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.200]
Thank God.

[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.060]
And at two o'clock we go downstairs and I was going to go to the office

[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.500]
and say, how do this get in this place, who lost it?

[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.680]
And I said, look in your mailbox first.

[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.720]
He opens up his mailbox.

[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.120]
Now as you would expect in an apartment building of large size,

[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.160]
the mailboxes are like, I don't know,

[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.860]
what would you say, like three by six, like that?

[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.180]
The little cubby's little pitch at home.

[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.460]
Yeah.

[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.040]
And he says, it's here.

[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.200]
And I look in the mail lady, the bitch, I mean the lady that delivers the mail.

[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.720]
She had taken this big FedEx size envelope and folded it over almost like a paper airplane,

[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.780]
you know, like in thirds.

[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.280]
Now suppose there have been like some important pictures or something.

[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.800]
And you know what I say?

[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.420]
She had no idea what's in there, right?

[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.460]
I mean, as it turns out, it was just fine.

[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.340]
But just so that took care of that.

[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.400]
That solved one problem.

[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.640]
Then, as I told you yesterday,

[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.280]
Norma can't and voice she sure can't,

[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.020]
was having that meeting with Joe Bell, that long awaited meeting.

[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.220]
It would have been better off if there would have been no meeting.

[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.520]
That's my advice to Norma.

[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.080]
I don't have any more meetings with Joe Bell.

[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.480]
Refuse to speak to him.

[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:37.920]
They'll take his calls.

[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.800]
Pretend he died.

[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.260]
Oh, God.

[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.660]
So I'm waiting during the course of the day and in around doing a bunch of stuff.

[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.620]
And I never hear from Norma Kent, who was going to call me right after the show,

[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.020]
with a report, spy report.

[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.060]
I'm glad he didn't because finding that package was a lot more important than what he had to report to me.

[00:07:59.380 --> 00:07:59.980]
Same old crap.

[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.740]
Joe Bell will do anything in his power to get rid of George.

[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.400]
Oh, he's got to save money.

[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.720]
He's going to show them how to make money.

[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.280]
He doesn't care.

[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.180]
Let me tell you.

[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:15.700]
And then this is what I just wrote back to Norma, who wrote me this long apologetic crap.

[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.800]
After what they did to Ken Maldon, nobody is safe.

[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:21.800]
Yeah.

[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.060]
Isn't that putting it well?

[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.080]
Right?

[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.720]
Here is one of the finest gentlemen who has ever worked in this business, ever, anywhere.

[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.280]
Just a great guy who couldn't have been making, you know, how much could he have been making?

[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.420]
Not much.

[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.640]
And they just, they have to.

[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:47.100]
This man will f anybody to save his own fat ass, to be the hero for the beastly broadcasting group.

[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.500]
Give it your best shot, Joe.

[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.720]
Says right in my contract, the producer has to be someone that I approve of.

[00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.140]
And you can bring me flea's name or any other flea just sent me by the way of a poll suggestion.

[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.040]
A really bad one, too.

[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:01.740]
I deleted it.

[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.180]
What do you think that's all about?

[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:04.900]
I don't know.

[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.520]
I didn't get it.

[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.480]
Maybe I did.

[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.240]
I did.

[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.200]
I got it.

[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.940]
No, I got the online contest email.

[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.260]
No.

[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.960]
I wouldn't even forward it to you.

[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.200]
But anyway, just just keep in mind.

[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:29.960]
I told you off the year before the show and I'm putting it on the year because I want the entire audience to know that George is the next one who said is on the chopping block and then for whatever reason.

[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.260]
Well, making all this muddy.

[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.160]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.620]
And the amount of money we're talking about is, and especially if he's really making that money now, then what's the problem?

[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.640]
Why do you keep interfering with the show?

[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.920]
You give us no support, Joe.

[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:42.520]
Nothing.

[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:43.780]
Nothing.

[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.200]
I don't take calls anymore.

[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:47.620]
Why?

[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.120]
Because you've allowed two idiots to destroy their phone.

[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.480]
And even the last time you did the show, you were practically in tears about it.

[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.980]
Am I right?

[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.220]
Well, it was in tears.

[00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.260]
But yeah, it's frustrating.

[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.920]
Frustrating and annoying.

[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.060]
And not the way anybody should have to do it or radio show.

[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.720]
No support.

[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.400]
No promotion.

[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.620]
Nothing positive.

[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.580]
Everything with this man is always negative, negative, negative.

[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:17.320]
And isn't it just a coincidence that everybody on a radio station from Joe Rose, whose number is now a half of what they used to be?

[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.960]
To me, whose numbers are less than half what they used to be, to Jim Mandage, whose fading from the map.

[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.400]
Everybody is like falling off the face of the earth on QAM.

[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:59.380]
And this man is talking a big game with Norma Kent, like, oh, he's doing a hell of a job and he's doing bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-

[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:26.560]
And I'm trying to, like, you know, hang on to George's back here the best I can, but they- they- they've got the best I can, but they- they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've got the best I can, but they've

[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:32.500]
they've got the best I can, but they've got the best you want to call it. Which is only going to be made a hell of a lot worse by this panic over the swine flu.

[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:41.300]
is just an excuse for employers to screw employees everywhere. I mean who the hell knows what- would there anything they tell you is real or not?

[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.140]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:45.560]
Yep.

[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.300]
They're the employers and then the screwees.

[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.960]
We are the screwees.

[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.040]
And let me say it again after what they did to Ken Walden,

[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.600]
nobody who works for this company is safe.

[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.200]
Nobody.

[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.360]
Just remember I told you that April 28, 2009.

[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.160]
He'll do what he can.

[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.440]
Shake your hand like a friend.

[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.160]
Then quickly walk away.

[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.800]
Yes, they had Joe.

[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:49.100]
Go to 5'6'0 with ratings and the toilet bowl to get those

[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.540]
Playings for almost an order and control.

[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.240]
And then so, Golly Rolly Joe, a book you'll learn

[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.300]
And in the note he lets most go.

[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.200]
And here's what Bloss gives Golly his own show.

[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:12.300]
He'll make a big change and rearrange.

[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.560]
It's worse or the same.

[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:22.600]
He hasn't done a thing for what goes on the air and do.

[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.580]
Joe don't have a stinkin' clue about a poor,

[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.780]
Matt Madison, lead blow for all radio.

[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:37.120]
The GM of 5'6'0, Golly Rolly Joe.

[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.020]
1018 at 5'60 WQM.

[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.420]
Let's take a look at that award winning schedule.

[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.700]
We got Rock Solid, the big at 2'4'7,

[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.660]
Matt Doggett Shulas,

[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:10.740]
and then the big at 2'7'0.

[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.660]
Should have had Joe Bell on here.

[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.840]
Rush Limbaugh 307.

[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.660]
Wins hands down your pantaloonies.

[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.400]
The Humper did good though, 132.

[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.260]
Hank, man called her 93, Jim DeFeedus 76.

[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.360]
Oh, a monster in the news gathering business.

[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.700]
Larry King 48, Barney Frank 42, Michael Moore 33.

[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.520]
Don I'm a 30.

[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.900]
Bought 30, man.

[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.580]
H Wayne Heisinga 20, the Beast 19.

[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.660]
The Beast is right on Wayne's ass.

[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.580]
William the refrigerator Perry, he'd be ill in 18.

[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.100]
Mohauer Davided to do the 16.

[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.220]
L. Hamhawk Sunshine 14, L.N.D. Generate 14.

[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.280]
Pasty Face.

[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.140]
Dave Game 12, Howard Spurm 9,

[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.100]
and Kimba Bokehmpir only had a small pair.

[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.480]
That's the boy yesterday.

[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.280]
What are we doing today?

[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.440]
Taking a look at it?

[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.340]
Right now.

[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.440]
The most annoying habit other people can do in my presence is

[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.420]
emit bad breath or BO.

[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.900]
We have 377 vote.

[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:19.680]
Good start.

[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.680]
emit bad breath or BO 97.

[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.440]
Like it would bind.

[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.020]
Two with their mouth open, 56, 55.

[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.780]
Pick their nose 46.

[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:31.880]
That's what I voted.

[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.120]
The BO bothers me like crazy too, but I don't want to see

[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.740]
somebody else digging for gold.

[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.400]
I can't stand it.

[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.560]
I do a lot of picket my nose.

[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:43.920]
Don't you?

[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:44.740]
A lot.

[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:45.720]
A lot.

[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.000]
Well, not in front of people though.

[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:48.920]
No, but not.

[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.860]
I don't want to make sure nobody else is looking.

[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.820]
The only place where it's bad is on an airplane.

[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:54.100]
Right.

[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.280]
And on an airplane,

[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.180]
your nose gets stuffed up because of the bad circulation of the air,

[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.260]
the bad stuff here.

[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.300]
And you get a lot of snot.

[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.340]
And I want to pick my nose on the airplane,

[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.160]
but I'm so afraid that somebody is going to be looking.

[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.760]
I'll blow my nose, but if that doesn't do the trick, you know?

[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.160]
Then you got to go to phase two.

[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.120]
By the way, I forwarded to you.

[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.820]
The poll suggestion that Flea had sent to me.

[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:19.740]
I wish I had a look at it.

[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.200]
I got it.

[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.760]
You get your email first for some reason.

[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.180]
Probably a candidate thing.

[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.160]
No, I just forwarded to you.

[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.180]
Or you got it originally.

[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.260]
Well, yeah.

[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.360]
Farth 40.

[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.820]
Somebody else farts in your presence gross, especially loud.

[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.340]
Although smelly is worse.

[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.860]
Loud, I wouldn't mind if it didn't stink.

[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.540]
Tube gum noisely 24.

[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.360]
Spit while talking 22.

[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.020]
Oh, yeah.

[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.720]
Like Dr. Ron from the hockey games years ago.

[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.140]
Oh.

[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.560]
What do you think a linguist?

[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.160]
He would just shower me with spittle every time you can.

[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.220]
And always talking right into your face.

[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.440]
Why do people feel they have to do that?

[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.620]
Do they think everybody is deaf?

[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.440]
There are people that their close talkers hate that.

[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.080]
Spit on the ground 21.

[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.800]
Scratch their balls 16.

[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.380]
Like Clarence did that one day.

[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.340]
He was conducting a search party.

[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.160]
Whistle 11.

[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.200]
Home 11.

[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.200]
Cracked their knuckles 9.

[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.840]
George says that all the time on the year.

[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.660]
Cough 7.

[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.760]
Murp 6.

[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.040]
Snees 6.

[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.300]
Well, how can you stop from sneezing if you're going to sneeze?

[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:31.020]
Right.

[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:31.980]
You pinch your nose.

[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:34.780]
You're that?

[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:35.920]
Yeah.

[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.060]
Pick their T3.

[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.680]
Bite their nails 3.

[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.140]
Jingle their keys 2.

[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.600]
Scratch their butt 1.

[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:43.880]
381.

[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.780]
I don't see a lot of it.

[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.340]
I don't encounter a lot of butt scratching.

[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.580]
Do you?

[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:48.860]
No.

[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:49.080]
No, no.

[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:49.160]

[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:49.580]
Record scratching.

[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.040]
Here's Stephen jerseys, is this on your other people's

[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:55.540]
annoying habits.

[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.300]
Can you please have?

[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.240]
Loud Joseph word conversation.

[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:58.560]
Sure.

[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.280]
You want to do it?

[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:00.880]
Sure.

[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:02.520]
Loud.

[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.160]
Sax...

[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.200]
Oh, boy!

[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:09.860]
Here we go.

[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.500]
The Supremes Redded again the F Passion Supreme Court.

[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.440]
I'll print this out.

[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.560]
Thanks to whoever sent this.

[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.000]
Thanks a pile.

[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.280]
And here's another one along when I'm going to print out.

[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:29.680]
Isn't that good?

[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:30.780]
We're off to a good start today.

[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.040]
Yep.

[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.200]
I haven't got to the one from the fake Tom Jikki yet.

[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.060]
The fake Tom Jikki by the way is D-FO.

[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.360]
Really?

[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.860]
You want to know how I figure that out?

[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:40.660]
How do you do?

[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.580]
Here's the latest one.

[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.480]
Tom Jikki, the fake one.

[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.020]
Subject, Jeff DeForest Fire Report.

[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.540]
Listen to 640WFTL this morning heard D-FO.

[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.340]
He mentioned the big O and Mandage

[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.180]
and told some old WQM stories.

[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.380]
It was actually pretty entertaining and funny.

[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.300]
You may remember, but D-FO did 6 to 8 PM with Mandage

[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.220]
on WIOD Sports Talk 610.

[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.720]
This is either D-FO or Mr. Radio.

[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.500]
In the mid 90s, WQM needs you an exclamation point.

[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.520]
D-FO does Hobben, D-Zevio Locking Cup.

[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.320]
Wow, really?

[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.780]
We need him like a hole in the head.

[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.880]
Already been there, done that.

[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.680]
We've got enough recycled trash from the past already.

[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.020]
Okay?

[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.460]
Mr. Radio or whoever you are or MIFO?

[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.520]
Here's that thing.

[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.420]
The Supreme Court is giving tentative approval

[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.280]
to government regulation of even a single curse word

[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.080]
on live television.

[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.800]
The Court in a 5 to 4 decision today

[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.060]
is refusing to pass judgment

[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.560]
on whether the FCC's fleeting expel

[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.120]
his policies in line with first amendment guarantees

[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.140]
of freedom of speech.

[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.520]
The justice is say a federal appeal score

[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.760]
should weigh the constitutionality of the policy.

[00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.060]
Talk, I thought that was their job.

[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:00.940]
Yeah.

[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.120]
The decision throws out a ruling

[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.240]
by the second US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.

[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.200]
The appeal score had found in favor

[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.240]
of a Fox TV led challenged the policy

[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.260]
and had returned the case to the FCC

[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.880]
to let the agency provide a reasoned analysis

[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.600]
for its tougher line on indecency.

[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.700]
The commission appealed instead to the Supreme Court

[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.420]
and the Supreme Court said,

[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:21.440]
but it would be, but it would be,

[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.420]
just like that meeting with Joe Bell

[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.700]
in the Norma Cant last night.

[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.000]
No more meetings, Norma.

[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:27.980]
Don't look at him.

[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:28.700]
Don't talk to him.

[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.520]
Don't spit on him.

[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.000]
Don't get near him.

[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.020]
I don't think that the most dangerous disease

[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.500]
in the world right now is swine flu.

[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.560]
I think it's Joe Bellitis.

[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.320]
I think we got it.

[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.080]
I couldn't sleep till 2.30 in the morning.

[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.260]
I was so agitated after my conversation with Norma,

[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.620]
which was hours earlier in the night.

[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:49.340]
Sorry about that.

[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:50.800]
Although I did watch Deadpool.

[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.260]
Well, it wasn't just the part about you.

[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.380]
I mean, that's disturbing to me.

[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.600]
You've been on the show almost 20 years

[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.360]
to a fine job.

[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.520]
You're there when we need you.

[00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.480]
And that's the problem.

[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.720]
You're part of this show.

[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.400]
You're not part of his, you're not on his buddies.

[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.360]
It's not about business.

[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.080]
It's personal.

[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.440]
He pretends it's about business

[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.740]
and about saving them money and all that.

[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:07.840]
It's got nothing to do with that.

[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.380]
This is a man who wants everybody in the building

[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.520]
to be one of his flunkies.

[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:14.900]
And you wait.

[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:15.820]
I don't.

[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.080]
You didn't come from Charlotte.

[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.980]
You didn't come from the West Coast of Florida.

[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.800]
You're not one of Joe's flunkies.

[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.340]
And so you're out, George.

[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.400]
Danny Boykane 13 from Jersey.

[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.740]
Says I'm a lawyer.

[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.380]
I was wondering if you could help me out.

[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:33.960]
I doubt it.

[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.640]
I'm a professional tutor, a lifelong fan

[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.920]
of the University of Miami and Rutgers.

[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.520]
I think Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player ever.

[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.700]
I think New York pizza is better than Walmart pizza.

[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.360]
I'm a perfectly normal person.

[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.420]
I am alive.

[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.560]
Yet everyone on the University of Miami message board

[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.380]
believes I died from a swine flu yesterday.

[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.660]
They said it was reported on CNN and Fox News

[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.360]
and the onion and TMZ that I died.

[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.260]
And I searched their sites extensively.

[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.420]
No, I did not die, but nobody believes me.

[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.720]
I posted videos on YouTube proving I'm alive.

[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.500]
And everyone thinks I'm an imposter.

[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.380]
Neil, can you please read this and convince everyone

[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.880]
I'm alive and well, I'm at my wood send.

[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.080]
Thank you for your help.

[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.360]
Danny Boykane 13 from New Jersey.

[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.280]
Do you have any idea what that means?

[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.100]
No, hey, he's not dead.

[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.340]
Kill some good time, though.

[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.440]
Kill about two minutes.

[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.920]
Oh, by the way, I did the wrong spot in the last breakout.

[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.860]
I'll swap it with the next hour.

[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.100]
I did the wrong spot.

[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.100]
I'm getting way ahead of myself.

[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.900]
1027 at 560, QM.

[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.740]
I bet you did a lot of b.

[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.060]
The New Rogers on sports,

[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.640]
whole radio, WQ, A.M.

[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:43.780]
Yeah.

[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:46.880]
Yeah.

[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:52.940]
Yeah.

[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:57.280]

[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.780]
Joyce is out to get us.

[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:02.720]
Absolutely.

[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.820]
What you read and just join us show.

[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.160]
Joyce is a fan of 30.

[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:14.860]
Huh?

[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.440]
Look in my radio.

[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.340]
Joyce won't let me.

[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.560]
Joyce won't let me.

[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.940]
Joyce won't let me.

[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.660]
Oh, they ain't farts.

[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.280]
Joyce went to Jitilu Blastoo.

[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.880]
But it's for stupid hat,

[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.380]
Roger the turtle.

[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.400]
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.820]
Absolutely, absolutely.

[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.540]
Joyce won't let me.

[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.040]
Joyce won't let me.

[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.100]
Joyce won't let me.

[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:19.480]
Oh.

[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.400]
I don't wanna hear any more.

[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.160]
It's like, man, this is not about me.

[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.980]
Anybody out there, I got you.

[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.000]
I take up prisoners.

[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.400]
Get out of the gate.

[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.500]
I'm afraid of I need.

[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.880]
I'm just a destroyer.

[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.240]
I only shut a key to six business.

[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.720]
I don't have a key for any of that.

[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:33.860]
I'll be your buddy.

[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:34.960]
I'm like a nice guy.

[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:35.720]
I don't know.

[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:36.220]
I don't know.

[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.400]
Grab the mouse.

[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.120]
Get me no more farts.

[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.340]
You know we can't play no farts.

[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.080]
I don't get a farts.

[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.920]
I don't know.

[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.060]
I don't get a farts.

[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.860]
I don't get a farts.

[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.800]
I don't get a farts.

[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.740]
1033, 2074, 11 at 5.

[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.680]
60 WQAM, you're destroying as they come station.

[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.160]
They just keep coming along and we keep obliterating them

[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:07.880]
from the human race.

[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.380]
We got Joe Bellitis.

[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.140]
Bad kid.

[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.380]
Terminal dose, I think.

[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.980]
So what are you doing to protect yourself from swine flu?

[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:21.460]
Nothing.

[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.440]
Me too.

[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.500]
I'm looking fewer people than I used to.

[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.180]
Yeah.

[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.920]
And don't take too many deep breaths when you're out among people.

[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.540]
No, I'm just up, stop breathing altogether.

[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:30.800]
That's a good idea.

[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.480]
In fact, I think you just solved the QAM problem, the beastly problem.

[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:36.580]
They really want to save money.

[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.920]
Why not just fire everybody?

[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.960]
We can have Joe and Clarence and Flea.

[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.040]
Flea's already demonstrated he can do about a dozen jobs.

[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.820]
We can just have the three of them run the joint and fire everybody else.

[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:48.120]
Sure.

[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.280]
I was going to say pay off people with contracts, but the day that these people pay anybody,

[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.880]
never going to happen.

[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.600]
See, that should have been the topic of this meeting between Norma and Joe Bell.

[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.020]
Come up with a number, Joe.

[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.360]
Write a check and he'll go away.

[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:07.500]
Because I'm sure that's what they want in spite of all their denials and in spite of your resistance to that idea.

[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.080]
Oh no, I think they want you to go away.

[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.460]
They're just not going to pay you to go away.

[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.540]
Right, that's right.

[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.680]
The fake Tom Jicke, a subject, Manny Munoz.

[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.340]
Manny Munoz has been calling Joe and Josh Dindigat on WQM.

[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.640]
He's currently the producer on South Florida's first news hosted by Jimmy Cifilis on 610WYOD.

[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.100]
No kidding.

[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.740]
He's an ass clown, Manny Munoz.

[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.320]
He used to crank call the goddess.

[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.160]
Oh, Manny Munoz.

[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:40.740]
What a loser.

[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.600]
Pete's in Lake Worth.

[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:42.780]
Peter.

[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:43.280]
Peter.

[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:44.920]
Yeah, I ran that.

[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:45.240]
Peter.

[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:46.100]
How you doing?

[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.360]
I'm all right, darling.

[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:47.980]
How you doing?

[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.420]
I got that Manny Fired, huh?

[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.900]
I got that Manny Fired.

[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.860]
Why'd you get fired, you hypocritical.

[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.340]
Oh, it's still man.

[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:54.740]

[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.740]
Why does Manny crank call the station?

[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.600]
What is his problem?

[00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.340]
Because he's a lunatic.

[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.820]
He's a good friend of yours, though, Manny.

[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:04.760]
Yeah, we hang out all the time.

[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:05.560]
Isn't he one of yours?

[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.160]
I haven't seen him since we worked together.

[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.040]
Yeah, he's one of mine.

[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.760]
Speaking of that, Dave Johnson will be calling in Thursday for our annual Kentucky Derby preview show.

[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.100]
Speaking of one of yours, I'm thinking of that mole line.

[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:18.940]
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.980]
And you came up with maybe your best line of all time immediately.

[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.900]
You said I didn't know Dave was Jewish.

[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.040]
That was great.

[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:25.680]
Thank you.

[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.580]
Oh, and by the way, speaking of that, yesterday at the end of the show when I was choking to death.

[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.320]
Yeah.

[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.040]
And I'm glad I saved it because there were a lot of names.

[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.800]
I don't know who put that thing together.

[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.380]
Because there were a lot of names on that poll of people who are not Jewish.

[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.980]
Pauli Osev, whoever this Pauli guy is.

[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.220]
Joan Crawford, sure as hell wasn't Jewish.

[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.740]
Charles Bronson is Polish and Ukrainian, so he's not Jewish.

[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.740]
There's a whole bunch of people on here who are not and never have been and never going to be Jewish.

[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.060]
Pauli.

[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.220]
God.

[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.460]
Tony Randall's name was Sydney Rosenberg.

[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.200]
Can you believe that?

[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:05.160]
I believe it.

[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.960]
I think it'd be fun to read the list again.

[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.780]
George Burns, Nathan Beerenbaum.

[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:10.980]
I just love that name.

[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:11.740]
That's a good name.

[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.360]
It's a great you name, man.

[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:13.880]
Beerenbaum.

[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.540]
I mean, Lipschitz is better.

[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.600]
Who was, how Lipschitz was at Hal Linden?

[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:20.340]
I think so.

[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.920]
I don't know. I put it just put it away.

[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.860]
Because otherwise I'll be tempted to read it again because they probably didn't get the benefit of it yesterday because I was sitting here choking to death.

[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:28.220]
Right.

[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.920]
Yagging on my, a Shwinehund flu.

[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.640]
You people in the media are a bunch of crazy people and every opportunity they get.

[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.060]
They overdo it.

[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.760]
They get people whipped up into a frenzy.

[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.080]
Oh, but they're going to save so many lives and Dr. Poop did there on CNN.

[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.960]
They're even asking is it, is it safe to eat pork products?

[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.440]
And the obvious answer is yeah, unless you're Orthodox Jewish.

[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.420]
Or Muslim.

[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.940]
Isn't it amazing how the Muslims and the Jews have got so much in common?

[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.740]
Not amazing at all.

[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.860]
They don't eat pork.

[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.880]
They're both Semites children of Abraham.

[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.320]
Circumuscribed.

[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:04.700]
Right.

[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.020]
Nifty headgear.

[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:08.460]
Sure.

[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.600]
Brandon says here's something for the poll.

[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.700]
Why today is the first day in a, and you know something?

[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.700]
Today is only a week that I've had this crowd.

[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.920]
It seems like months.

[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:19.860]
Yeah.

[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.680]
But it was a week ago today that I said I don't know what I'm doing here today and I can barely speak.

[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.300]
That was the day this thing really kicked in.

[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:33.060]
Well, a week is not that long for a sinus infection or anasty cold or the regular non-swine flu.

[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.580]
Oh, he's got the bird flu.

[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.560]
He's got the avion flu.

[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.040]
Remember that?

[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:37.580]
Yeah.

[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.540]
Everybody go out and stock up on cipro.

[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.680]
Everybody was buying cipro and stockpiling it.

[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.040]
And then about two weeks later there was no more avion flu.

[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:44.500]
That's right.

[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.380]
There's avion.

[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.240]
You can buy it in bottles if you want expensive water.

[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.460]
Brandon says here's something for the poll.

[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.320]
One thing that drives me beyond nuts are sloppy eaters.

[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.960]
I know it's asking too much for manners, but please don't be a complete slob at the table.

[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.580]
You want to put that on there?

[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:02.240]
Doing it now.

[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:03.620]
Eat sloppy.

[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.660]
I wonder Jennifer Velopi eats sloppy.

[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:10.660]
Oh.

[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:13.000]
Tony Cigarette would know, but he's retired now.

[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.580]
So just amazing what's going on.

[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:16.480]
Everybody is vanishing.

[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.680]
Everybody's either getting fired or taking early retirement or being forced out.

[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.460]
Radio TV, newspapers, magazines.

[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.120]
Everybody's getting squeezed out.

[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.080]
It's the big squeeze.

[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.160]
It's the big screw.

[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.680]
So next time you see Joe Bell looking in with a real...

[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:36.700]
Baaah!

[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:36.920]
Look.

[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:38.120]
Alright.

[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.160]
Don't let him feed you any crap man.

[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.200]
He hates you like poison.

[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:41.760]
I understand.

[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.700]
He doesn't give a crap about you, about your family, about your life, about your responsibilities.

[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.420]
He couldn't care less about you.

[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.000]
And he also doesn't like you on the year too now we find out.

[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.000]
This is the first, just another excuse.

[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:53.940]
I see.

[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.360]
Doesn't think you're an adequate replacement.

[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:57.600]
I see.

[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.700]
This came blurting out of his fat ugly mouth last night of this meeting.

[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.980]
Or when I went over the hell it took place.

[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.040]
Michael says Uncle Neil, please touch base on two topics.

[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.840]
The Craigslist killer fear on say, what is it to say about that?

[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.040]
He's a bad man.

[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:18.580]
People that go searching for other people on Craigslist must be crazy people.

[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.100]
Because that's where all the crazy people end up is on Craigslist.

[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.160]
And the Air Force 1 decoy flying over Manhattan.

[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.420]
Yeah, what were they thinking about?

[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.080]
What, what is there to say about those things?

[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:28.820]
What is there to say?

[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.480]
Except maybe...

[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:30.920]
Bwaah!

[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:31.340]
Yeah.

[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.740]
Bubba's topic today, how the cheap channel people are trying to sabotage his advertisers,

[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.180]
offering four competing stations per commercial.

[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.320]
Waaah!

[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:42.340]
Waaah!

[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.300]
Love always Mike W. Invoker.

[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.280]
But then that was really the cooped grace.

[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:55.700]
When Joe Bell uses Bubba the love sponge endorsement of the show as evidence that the show is just as fine as DIY.

[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.280]
Yeah, what else do you want?

[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.760]
What I'd like him to do is admit that Joyce and him have destroyed the show that we have very little left

[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.240]
and that they continue trying to do it.

[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.480]
They won't stop.

[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.920]
They won't be satisfied until everybody on the radio station has a point.

[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.380]
And we all went up at the Mount Elliott Soup Kitchen.

[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.060]
Oh, me!

[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.180]
Space and stands for nothing.

[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.600]
This is I with this news.

[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.340]
It'll ask if you have any Sarah Palin.

[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.360]
Know her daughter, Bristol, was having sex.

[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:23.360]
Darn right.

[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.280]
In the darkest of places.

[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:26.300]
In the butt.

[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:31.120]
I've been there with Joe the Plumber and Joe Sixpack and four bears.

[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.720]
We'll show you some racy clips.

[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.380]
It's enormous.

[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:36.380]
Four.

[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.340]
I wonder if Sarah being the slut, the horny slut that she is.

[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.440]
I wonder if she ever wanted to get her hooks into Levi.

[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:43.600]
I don't know.

[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.260]
Maybe she'd go, I sure would.

[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.760]
I want to get my Schmidt hooks into Levi.

[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.840]
But ain't going to happen.

[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.820]
Ain't never going to meet no Levi Johnston or his Johnson.

[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.120]
Tracking the swine flu online.

[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.180]
Here we go.

[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:56.960]
Right.

[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:57.500]
Right over there.

[00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:58.940]
Click back on the United States.

[00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.920]
It zooms over here.

[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:04.020]
If you're traveling, if you're doing, you want to know the latest reported cases.

[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.020]
Healthmap.org is helpful too.

[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.600]
And I don't see any in Greenland.

[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.480]
There's no people there either.

[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:10.980]
You want to be safe.

[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:11.620]
Go to Greenland.

[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.020]
Sure.

[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.340]
And a good idea on my way.

[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.360]
420 in just this morning.

[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.560]
428 votes on the pool.

[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.000]
I'll tell you what there's nobody else who's they're going to bring in.

[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.120]
Who's going to say just this morning?

[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.820]
I'm sure I'll read it out for them and put it on a post-it note here.

[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:26.800]
Yeah, read it out for free.

[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.280]
Now, so what's your take on that?

[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.000]
Idiotic pool that he suggested.

[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.160]
What where did that come from?

[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.120]
I don't know.

[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.880]
I don't think it's a very smart pool to take.

[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:37.780]
No, of course not.

[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.300]
You think I would do that pool?

[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:42.800]
You think I would even read it?

[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:43.540]
No.

[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.600]
Read the question?

[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:44.900]
No.

[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:45.340]
No.

[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:53.540]
This indicates to me that flea is as good as he is in many areas is not ready for prime time.

[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.700]
And certainly not ready to carry your shoes.

[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.220]
Or fill them.

[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:04.600]
By the way, the character Adam Baldwin played the crazy guy in that movie, Deadbolt.

[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.320]
He had squeaky loafers.

[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.040]
Okay.

[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.380]
Oh, what do you people starting with the ice cream?

[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:17.880]
I'm just recovering from this awful sinus infection and crud, the Shfinheun flu or whatever I got.

[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.580]
And you're starting with ice cream?

[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:20.600]
That's the last thing you need.

[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.040]
This is Blackie who I thought was my friend.

[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.900]
Blackie's generally a pretty good emailer.

[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.320]
Starting with the frickin ice cream.

[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:27.940]
Stop.

[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.000]
Stop now before it's too late.

[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.240]
It's not bad enough we got Joe Bellitis.

[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:34.900]
We got a fight.

[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.080]
Maybe we got Tinkerbell's palsy.

[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:41.480]
Okay.

[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.120]
Do you think that could be it?

[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:47.400]
I think I had like a little bit of that at the IOD once upon a time.

[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:47.800]
Remember that?

[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.280]
My lip was like clipping and.

[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:50.040]
Yes.

[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.280]
Although I'll tell you we never had the disease at IOD.

[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.140]
We had the corporate disease from the vents.

[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.060]
Oh, right.

[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.940]
What was that guy that listener that came in with his company?

[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.080]
Barry Jackass.

[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:05.540]
No.

[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:06.940]
Very Macockner.

[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:07.680]
Okay.

[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.360]
That's it.

[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:09.480]
No, whatever it was.

[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.080]
And they came in and they went through the vents in the building at IOD.

[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.500]
They volunteered to do it for free, which is the only way we could get it done.

[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.080]
And they took pictures of all the mong?

[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:18.860]
Yeah.

[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.600]
Oh my god.

[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.880]
It looked like mountains of crap in the vents.

[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:23.280]
Yep.

[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.480]
Mountains of it.

[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:26.120]
It's amazing. There was any air flow at all.

[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:30.740]
And we were sitting there breathing in this crap every day and everybody was always coughing and sick and puking.

[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:35.380]
And Bob Green's answer was, it's not financially expedient for us to do anything about it this time, Neil.

[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:40.560]
It's not financially all the people are like ready to pass out and croak, but it wasn't financially expedient.

[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:41.260]
Mm-hmm.

[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.360]
You people in management in this business, you're a bunch of grave robbers.

[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.780]
If there is a hell, Joe Bell will be there for eternity.

[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.860]
And I'd even be pleased to be there too, just to see him burn.

[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:04.000]
Just to see the torture and suffering he's going to endure for screwing up so many people's lives.

[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:09.020]
See, when they found him, what they were looking for was somebody with no conscience, none zero.

[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.940]
Somebody totally anti-human and they found him.

[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.820]
The answer, Joe, very simple is no.

[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:22.980]
No.

[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:23.860]
No.

[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:24.560]
That's it.

[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.380]
What part of the no don't you understand?

[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:26.960]
No.

[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.100]
Go diddle with somebody else's show.

[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:35.880]
Go fire some of the suits that are wandering around that building, doing absolutely nothing, pulling down thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars.

[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.240]
Hell a lot more than George is making.

[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:39.240]
Mm-hmm.

[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.860]
Blacky says, good morning, Neil.

[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.760]
I don't know if you have a basket of robins in Toronto.

[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.100]
Yes.

[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.480]
Or if you even like their ice cream, yes, I do. I love it.

[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:53.320]
There's a big basket of robins in the food court at the Eton Center, where you can do a lot of eating.

[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.720]
Wednesday is 31 cents scoop night.

[00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.440]
I know you're trying to stay off the suites, but this sounds like a good deal.

[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.080]
Tell George to take the kids.

[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.500]
Trying to help out on these tough economic times.

[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.500]
And in closing, I'm sure Keith Magnuson is proud of his black hawks.

[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.560]
Rest in peace.

[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.920]
Yeah, the black hawks won a 4-1 last night. They won a series.

[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.380]
They beat the Calgary Flamers.

[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.340]
4-2, 4 games to 2.

[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.520]
BYE-LE-AINING!

[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.120]
I have an email about the black hawks.

[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.000]
Yep.

[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.580]
Has to do with those young studs.

[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.400]
I'll get to it. It's in my pile here. Just relax.

[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.860]
We got three hours and 10 minutes to go. Who's counting?

[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.140]
Let me say it again. 4 hours. Way too long.

[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.380]
Way too long. Half an hour would be good.

[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.860]
Do you think? Sure.

[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:36.860]
Be tight-shuff.

[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.340]
If I were you, though, I wouldn't be making too many comments, because I hear your time is limited.

[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:41.400]
That's what I hear.

[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:49.460]
I mean, what kind of devious, subhuman, debag?

[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:57.760]
Oh, look at this Academy of Doctors of Audiology, the sponsor, here for you to advance national hearing health during better hearing month.

[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.820]
Better get Joe Bell and touch with them, because he don't hear the word no.

[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.800]
Ain't going to happen, Joe. The word is no.

[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:10.240]
Get out of this show. Quit diddling with this show, man. Quit diddling with everybody's life.

[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.980]
You make us sick. You make us pine for Greg Reed.

[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.200]
Can you ever believe that that thought would even ever cross your mind?

[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.440]
No.

[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.600]
You make us pine for Mo.

[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.320]
Mo was a real gentleman compared to Joe.

[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.340]
I think we lost our Mojo.

[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.440]
And Manny Munoz. I think Manny is all these fakers.

[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.600]
It could be. It's been suggested.

[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:42.160]
Certainly somebody from the inside or somebody nutty enough and sometimes acknowledges names and all that crap.

[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.820]
DeFo, it's all circles around IOD.

[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:46.120]
Right.

[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:59.480]
Having heard from the youngsters, Jimmy Cifilis today, I wonder if the big O talked about the rift on the draft party over the weekend between the big O and Jimmy Cifilitic.

[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.740]
I don't know. Probably not allowed to discuss it. I don't know.

[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.460]
You want to play the tape? Let's play the big O2 for our.

[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.260]
Excuse me. Sorry. Well, no, what's going on with you?

[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:13.920]
You got some kind of just a quarantine.

[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.940]
Now Mike sends me an email, subject annoying.

[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.480]
It's got nothing to do with our poll question.

[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:32.100]
The poll question is about things that people do in your presence that you find repulsive and offensive, farting, burping those things.

[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:38.540]
Mike says, I can't stand it when I hear the limies and the people up north adding ER to words that end in A.

[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:42.960]
For example, Florida, China, Tampa, Georgia, what's up with that?

[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.800]
What's up with that? Is regional affectations? What's up with that, Mike?

[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.940]
The Brits do it. The South Africans do it.

[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.440]
Anybody with British crap in their blood? The Aussies do it.

[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:57.060]
Trevor Dindman does it all the time.

[00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:03.260]
The Great Race Collar from Santa Nier adds an ER to words that end in A.

[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:11.380]
People from Boston, New York and the Brits and their kin are the ones who are the worst offenders.

[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.040]
What's the big deal with that? Who cares?

[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:18.460]
I'd rather hear somebody say Florida than let me ask you a question.

[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:24.580]
That bugs the hell out of me. Not for the poll, but just in terms of people speaking.

[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.440]
Let me ask you about Florida and Miami.

[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.500]
Miami beats Miami. That's what the late Swifty Shindler used to say.

[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.380]
I don't ever hear old crackers say that.

[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.360]
I never heard him call it Swifty Shindler until Ellie Brecher wrote that obituary.

[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.160]
Deadbolt, Adam Baldwin, Justine Bateman. Anybody see it?

[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:45.740]
I'm glad.

[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.900]
I enjoyed it. To probably going to say that's one of the worst movies.

[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:52.480]
Your taste in movies is bad as you taste in music, Neil, and food and everything else.

[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.480]
And general managers.

[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.200]
And one thing I'll say about a normal cant.

[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:06.600]
She has been totally, completely 100, I mean nobody's perfect if you said her.

[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.720]
100% ineffective since Joe Bell came to town.

[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:15.000]
Totally, thoroughly. I think they laugh at him.

[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:17.940]
You know what I mean?

[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:18.400]
Yeah.

[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.740]
They laugh. I cry.

[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.660]
Alisa says Carrie Grant was Jewish, but his real name was Archibald Alexander Leach.

[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.220]
I did a paper on him in college.

[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.160]
Love you, Alisa. Thank you, Alisa.

[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:38.140]
The thing about the Jewish name was pretty interesting except for the goyem that run list.

[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:43.680]
Joan Crawford, Jewish. I mean, who put that together?

[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:44.660]
What kind of maniac?

[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.220]
Oh, here's the fake Tom Jicke again.

[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.220]
You know me. I'm not Mr. Radio or D.Fo.

[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.800]
As the brainstem would say, WQM needs some help.

[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.620]
Joe Rose cannot carry a talk show by himself. He is weak at best.

[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:02.680]
Really? Joe should rehire D.Fo and Geltie and create the first team.

[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.400]
Yeah, that's what we're looking for is to add a lot more people on the payroll.

[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.420]
Good timing, fake Tom Jicke.

[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.500]
We'll also throw in many Munoz while you're at it.

[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:16.840]
Oh my God. The fake Tom Jicke.

[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.320]
You know me. Yeah, I'm sure I do.

[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:20.760]
Some radio misfit.

[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:21.220]
Yeah.

[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.360]
Anybody that wants D.Fo back on the station must need mental help.

[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.520]
Maybe they have a fetish for corn.

[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.320]
That corn sure grows tall on the D.Fo show.

[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:37.940]
I heard it was special.

[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:39.700]
Yeah, really is special.

[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.120]
So you never saw it that bold, huh?

[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:43.900]
Not that I think of, but no.

[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:46.820]
I think you might enjoy it.

[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.400]
I'm going to give it a watch. I'm going to go steal it.

[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.420]
I mean, the end is predictable and you know all that, but it's...

[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.260]
Kills an hour and a half and it ain't so bad.

[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.060]
Oh, Neil!

[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.100]
This is the Neil Roger show.

[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.880]
This is your brain.

[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:03.860]
Any questions?

[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.580]
Are you ready boys?

[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.660]
Start galking.

[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:12.160]
Yeah.

[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:15.660]
Let's go.

[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.580]
You keep back and watch it.

[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.180]
I see the movie.

[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.500]
Cause the TV show was a very good.

[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:30.520]
You don't like your business, so you need a reason.

[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.180]
I'll give you one.

[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.000]
In fact, I'll give you two.

[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.260]
And these booze will make the watching.

[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.700]
That's what we hope you do.

[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:47.100]
Cause the TV only good things in the remake of the film.

[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.980]
If you don't like redneck and car chasing.

[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:54.980]

[00:43:56.580 --> 00:44:00.300]
You might think this movie is the worst.

[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:05.340]
But we hope you will still buy a ticket.

[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:10.580]
Just to see what's popping out of my shirt.

[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.480]
These booze will make the watching.

[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.160]
That's what we hope you do.

[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:22.280]
Cause they're the only good things in the remake of the film.

[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.260]
Living out to at 560 WQM.

[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.600]
How can you be talking about anything beside the Shrinehone flu?

[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:27.960]
Right?

[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.040]
And alien.

[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:30.360]
And the Pope.

[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:32.880]
Let's get those tapes on on Friday.

[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.940]
When people turn it on, they want to hear Neil's voice.

[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:35.520]
That's what they want.

[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:36.300]
They don't want George.

[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:37.320]
They want to hear the tapes.

[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:37.740]
Right.

[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:43.020]
This man is a stubborn and intractable as a friggin' mule.

[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.400]
I don't want to do the whole show on Joe Beligan.

[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:48.760]
I remember those days when those ugly renegotiations

[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.700]
for my deal were going on.

[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:50.580]
Yes.

[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:53.800]
And air every day I would come in and scream and holler and carry on it.

[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]
And what did it accomplish?

[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:55.500]
Nothing.

[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.680]
No, just a lot of odd to do, a lot of stress.

[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.500]
Mark and Miami makes a good point.

[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.240]
He says Neil, not that the Florida legislature has been able to pass a budget

[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.860]
with a session set to win on Friday.

[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.640]
But that's because they have more important things to do.

[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.400]
Such as pass a bill offering Jesus license plates

[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.360]
with the money benefiting faith-based teaching at schools.

[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.160]
And our governor, the gay Charlie Chris, says that he would not veto the bill

[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.560]
because it doesn't violate separation of church and state.

[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:25.580]
He's even happy that he'll generate more money for the charities involved.

[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.140]
Let me know if there's room for more people in Toronto, Mark and Miami.

[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.240]
No, no more room.

[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.500]
In his clothes, Mark.

[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:30.820]
Sorry.

[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:33.020]
Sorry, Mark.

[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:35.040]
Stick with your gay governor.

[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:38.380]
Jesus license plates.

[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:38.900]
Isn't that great?

[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:39.500]
Yep.

[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.420]
You're going to tack one on here?

[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:42.620]
Front and back.

[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.120]
When they bring you that new vehicle?

[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:44.580]
That's right.

[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.080]
I mean, you talk about a liar.

[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.480]
You talk about an instant seer.

[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.100]
You talk about backstabbing.

[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:52.160]
Frontstabbing.

[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.380]
You talk about somebody evil.

[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.100]
I'd get him first before he gets you.

[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:02.880]
Botulism.

[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.520]
Put it in his wikina.

[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.640]
Why don't you suggest going out to lunch with Joe?

[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:12.920]
Okay.

[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:13.780]
Yeah.

[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.620]
And just happen to have a jar of botulism stuff.

[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.620]
And when he's not looking, when he goes to take a big dump,

[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.640]
which ought to give you plenty of time in his case,

[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.420]
just smear a bunch of it on his bread.

[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.600]
He'll think it's jam on it.

[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.000]
Adam Oshmaku, we already know, is lifeless over there in Kitchener Waterloo.

[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.840]
Sends me an email about the swine flu.

[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.300]
It's in Russia, the Czech Republic, even in Livingston,

[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.380]
Alleyin, Counties, and Michigan.

[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.020]
It'll be in Toronto by next week.

[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:49.320]
This is what people have no life.

[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.060]
They sit around and fret and get all patty.

[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:53.580]
Get a life, Adam.

[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.740]
Get a search party together, round final life.

[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.920]
Get a search party together and go find a penis.

[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:04.220]
Even your own would be a good start.

[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:07.920]
Mike says, last week you said this, since the joke,

[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:26.140]
the ratings for most of QM's host have dropped.

[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.080]
I have news for you.

[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.380]
The reason your ratings have dropped,

[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.920]
has nothing to do with Joe Bell, has everything to do with $790.

[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:35.940]
The host on $790, not only talk about sports,

[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:37.900]
they talk about many other topics that benefit him.

[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:37.900]

[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:37.900]

[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:37.900]

[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:37.900]

[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.440]
That's why I said the kid had one shares in the morning

[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.500]
and Sadano's got one shares in the midday.

[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.520]
Jim Mandice is so old school,

[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.640]
unless you're 60-year-older, you're not going to find him interesting.

[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:51.600]
Dan La Bastard and Stu Gotts on the other hand are extremely entertaining

[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.180]
and they discuss many topics that guys like to talk about

[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.680]
and they always have interesting guests.

[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.400]
Mark my word when you finally retire.

[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.020]
Dan La Bastard will be the main man in South Florida radio.

[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:02.620]
Says Mike, you should live so long, Mike.

[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:07.240]
And it's interesting, and he also lumps Stu Gotts in there,

[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.180]
like he belongs on a year.

[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.220]
When Stu Gotts was on this station, what did I say?

[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.640]
He doesn't belong on a year, even to say hello.

[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:14.780]
Goodbye, yes, but not hello.

[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:19.940]
One note, Charlie, it's the Dan La Bastard, it's all they got.

[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.380]
And this business about all their other hosts, they're not entertaining,

[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:23.980]
they have no numbers, they got no audience.

[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.500]
And just like they were doing when they first went on a year,

[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.340]
and this obviously is from somebody over there,

[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.760]
they keep trying to talk themselves into ratings.

[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.260]
Either you've got them or you don't.

[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.080]
It's like balls, either you've got them or you don't.

[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:40.280]
And speaking of don't, Bob said listen to the first 30 minutes

[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:44.160]
of the big old show yesterday, he didn't mention a word about what happened over the weekend.

[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.720]
Sounds like he's been neutered, so to speak.

[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:49.760]
Maybe he's not rock solid.

[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.340]
After all, what do you think?

[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:52.460]
I don't know.

[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.620]
Oyeshmoid, you was back, chronic.

[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.060]
He says, we love you, George.

[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.640]
I know we all ragged on George as part of the show.

[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.780]
I think it would be a huge mistake to make canon.

[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.340]
He brings the dimension of the show that no one else can.

[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.220]
Besides if he goes, what will we bitch about?

[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.860]
Is the back station of the stabbing and every day thing?

[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.800]
No, it's not an everyday thing, it's an every second of every minute of every hour thing.

[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:22.320]
Since this new regime, this evil regime came in and took over.

[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.500]
He says, George is the next mole man.

[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.760]
You won't have him to kick around no more.

[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.680]
We wish you well, George, and all your future endeavors.

[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:34.000]
Joe Bell is swine and he's about to get you.

[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.380]
How do you like that?

[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.300]
Well, Joe Bell is swine.

[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.700]
Maybe that's what that flu came from.

[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:41.480]
Yeah.

[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.780]
I wonder if he's been to Mexico lately.

[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.240]
Let's send him there and put him on a subway, crowded subway.

[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:50.360]
I think that's a capital idea.

[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.660]
George Ann says, what the F-Duel Bell?

[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.100]
Besides you, Neil, George does a great job holding down the fort

[00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:00.200]
when you're sick around vacation.

[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.800]
He actually keeps the audience listening and participating, especially with the young

[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.680]
listeners who are the future of your show.

[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.100]
Personally, that roller derby crap sucks, but that's just me.

[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.740]
Still better than any Schmitty tape.

[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.480]
Screw Joe Bell always listening, George Ann.

[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:13.260]
Thank you, George Ann.

[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:13.820]
Thank you, George Ann.

[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:14.580]
She likes you.

[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.020]
She likes you just fine.

[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.840]
And the summer rating book has shown that year after year.

[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.120]
I'm only on two days a week, George, as most of the show is the ratings.

[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.460]
We still remember one on the station.

[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.060]
A lot of summers were number one in the market.

[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:27.560]
Right?

[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:28.200]
Most.

[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:29.960]
More often than not.

[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:34.080]
The fact that we don't do any marketing, we have no promotion in the fact that the signal is unlistable.

[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:37.060]
Those two things have nothing to do with the fact that the numbers are gone down.

[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.680]
It's the fact that 790 is doing so great with their gigantic one shares.

[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:41.380]

[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:42.740]
What do you guys say?

[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:43.640]
You guys keep it up.

[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:44.700]
Keep talking a good game.

[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:46.520]
Keep trying to convince yourselves.

[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:50.460]
And then when you got paid religion there on 790, when Lincoln Financial finally gives up the ghost.

[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.200]
And you got paid religion on there.

[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.400]
Oh gee, what happened?

[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:54.320]
We were doing so good.

[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.600]
Kicking some serious ass.

[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:58.380]
Sid the kid.

[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.400]
He was perfect for them.

[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.060]
Big mouth.

[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:02.820]
Talk a big game and produce nothing.

[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.120]
And how's that new morning show coming?

[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.740]
I bet your Steve White was on again this morning.

[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.140]
Because I checked their website.

[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.380]
Stay tuned for the new exciting morning show.

[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.980]
I double-dogged here then to put Stu Gotts on alone in the morning.

[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:20.680]
Well, Bastard don't need him.

[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.160]
Put the Stu Gotts show in the morning.

[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.540]
Do you like that?

[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:25.460]
Sounds great.

[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.160]
Stu Gotts in DFO.

[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.400]
And Josh Friedman.

[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:34.140]
And...

[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:34.720]
Come on, Atchah!

[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:35.840]
Jerks.

[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:36.440]
Wow.

[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.100]
And we'll even throw in...

[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.920]
That's a dream team you're talking about.

[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.520]
The dream, the scream team.

[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:44.780]
Oh no, you need Jimmy Cifilis for that.

[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.720]
Can you believe he said he's a screamer or something like that?

[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:51.780]
He said he knows how to scream.

[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:52.560]
Yeah.

[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.920]
I'll still got that if you want to hear it again.

[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:55.460]
No, no.

[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.220]
Let's not play that crap again.

[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.680]
If I thought there was going to be something really volatile there,

[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.560]
something really exciting, we were hoping.

[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:05.500]
It was coma inducing.

[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.160]
And if that's enough to get the sports and there's all whipped up out there,

[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.940]
although I guess compared to the rest of the drafts,

[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.320]
it must have been pretty damn assimilating.

[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:12.140]
I reckon.

[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.420]
If you've been injured and retained in the turn,

[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.780]
don't wait for your case to settle to get the money you need.

[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.640]
Fast funds will advance cash for your personal injury case

[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.560]
so that you can afford to wait while your attorney takes the time

[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:24.480]
to recover the maximum possible amount for your case.

[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.440]
Don't wait for the cash that you wrote.

[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:28.580]
They pay now and never charge interest.

[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.020]
And if there's no recovery in your case, you owe them nothing.

[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:35.840]
Call them to get your money now, 305-598-6430,

[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:39.200]
or apply online at fastfundsforu.com.

[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:40.940]
If you've been injured and retained in the turn,

[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.320]
only one call pays you now.

[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.780]
Fast funds advance his money for your personal injury

[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:46.580]
and they never, ever charge interest.

[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.420]
When you suffer an injury, the expenses can add up really fast.

[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:50.960]
So don't wait for the money you wrote.

[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.000]
Fast funds advance his cash for your case now.

[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.280]
And like I said, they never charge interest.

[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:58.580]
305-598-6430.

[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.320]
That's 305-598-6434.

[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.220]
Fast funds.

[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.020]
Oh, Neil!

[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:05.640]
You're listening to Neil Roger.

[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:06.260]
Neil?

[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.300]
God?

[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:24.100]
Oh, you can tell your fans.

[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.940]
You don't like their demands.

[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.860]
If they have some requests, you'll just say no.

[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:33.300]
And then tell them on my can to tell them management.

[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:36.420]
You want nobody missing with your show.

[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:39.360]
Go round from ten to two.

[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.240]
And when your shift is through,

[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.980]
tell George he can relax and smoke some weed.

[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:48.840]
And then go tell Joe Bell that he can go to hell.

[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:49.000]
Yeah.

[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.420]
He even almost makes you miss Gregory.

[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:52.200]
Absolutely.

[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.480]
But don't play a fart.

[00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:56.360]
The sound of a fart.

[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:59.180]
I don't think George would understand.

[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:04.040]
Because if you play a fart, the sound of a fart.

[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:07.000]
You'll be in trouble with a peacefully clam.

[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:30.720]
Don't play a fart.

[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.980]
Oh, I just got back in my chair just in the nicotine

[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:34.240]
my hall is meant to lift us.

[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:34.660]
Excellent.

[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:36.360]
No, they're not excellent.

[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:37.080]
They're reading on these.

[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:38.120]
No, I mean, next one, job.

[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:38.820]
Get it back in your chair.

[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.260]
Oh, just a minute, continue, man.

[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.380]
So Paul is back who sent me the Jewish names list.

[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:44.920]
Yes.

[00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.280]
He says, just copied and pasted a list I found.

[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:49.440]
I didn't verify all the names.

[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.360]
But now you made me go back and look at a couple

[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.820]
that some other people questioned as well.

[00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:54.660]
Apparently, Eddie Albert and his ancestors

[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:57.060]
were Christians, his ancestors.

[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.760]
You ready for that?

[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:01.580]
OK.

[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.500]
I could not find anywhere else that confirmed Joan Crawford

[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.120]
was a Jew as well about your better knowledge.

[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.500]
I don't have any knowledge of it.

[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:09.200]
It just seems unlikely.

[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:10.060]
Yeah.

[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:12.900]
Charles Bronson was Jewish.

[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:14.400]
I found that in several places on Google.

[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:17.700]
He says, well, somebody sent me an email at the end of the show

[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.760]
yesterday, adamant that Charles Bronson was not.

[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:21.280]
So whatever he is, he is.

[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:21.660]
Right.

[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:25.220]
Like Michael said to what's his name?

[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:26.860]
You are what?

[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.240]
You are what you are.

[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:31.320]
Ralph Lorenz, real name is Ralph Lipschitz.

[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.000]
Levi Strauss and Calvin Klein were also Jewish.

[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:37.360]
Now, there's a few Jews still left.

[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:38.840]
There's still a few who was running around.

[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.620]
Although if Joe Bell has his way, now that's interesting.

[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.640]
Maybe Joe thinks that since you're speaking to Yiddish now.

[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:45.580]
Yeah.

[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:47.420]
That there's a little Jew in you.

[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:49.980]
That could be.

[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:51.560]
Fat man after dark.

[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:52.860]
Boy, haven't heard from him in a long time.

[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:53.280]
I remember him.

[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:53.500]
Right?

[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:56.000]
I missed the first hour of the show.

[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:56.760]
What's up with George?

[00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:57.440]
Has he been let go?

[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:58.160]
Well, he's right here.

[00:55:58.660 --> 00:55:59.380]
You still here?

[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:00.660]
Amazingly.

[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.240]
That would be a terrible mistake, but not unexpected for these

[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.260]
fans to make such a short-sighted, ridiculous move.

[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.520]
While they're trying, Joe Bell is trying very hard.

[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:08.820]
He wants George out.

[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.040]
Now, immediately if not sooner.

[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:14.740]
Right.

[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:18.060]
He was, as he was giving me a shot.

[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:22.140]
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different

[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:22.540]
results.

[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:27.900]
If your lawyer is incompetent, hire another one or get a real agent or both, you're

[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.140]
a nationally known radio personality.

[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:29.800]
You have the money.

[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:30.540]
You have a contract.

[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:31.560]
What's the problem?

[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:36.440]
If your lawyer is useless and can't get the job done, who is responsible, not him?

[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.660]
Remember, no one cares as much about you as you.

[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:40.340]
Have a nice day.

[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:40.720]
You.

[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:42.900]
Rives with you.

[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:43.460]
You.

[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:43.760]

[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:44.180]
You.

[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:46.300]
You.

[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:46.960]
You.

[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:47.180]

[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:48.320]
Yeah.

[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:52.080]
Here's a dead person.

[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.040]
Frankie Manning dies at 94.

[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.560]
Help popularize the Lindy Hop.

[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.400]
Who?

[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:01.040]
The Lindy Hop.

[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.280]
A little before your time, Fr.

[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:02.820]
I'll say.

[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:09.140]
Frankie Manning was a star attraction of Harlem's Savoy Ballroom and brought to swing dance

[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:10.740]
or is that swine dance?

[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:15.160]
Swing dance, a flare for theatrical, helped Ketapal to Lindy Hop from Ballroom's Disagent

[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:15.420]
Screen.

[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:21.820]
Frankie Musselhead Manning, a Harlem dancer and Tony Ward choreographer, widely celebrated

[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:23.080]
as one of the pioneers of Lindy Hop.

[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:27.680]
A breathless, acrobatic swing dance style of 30s and 40s, died April 27.

[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:31.180]
That sounds like yesterday to me at New York City's Lennox Hospital of pneumonia.

[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:32.240]
He was 94.

[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.400]
He was only 94 and he got pneumonia and then he died.

[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:40.720]
The effortlessly nimble Manning was a star attraction of Harlem's Savoy Ballroom and

[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:45.060]
brought to swing dance a flare for the theatrical that helped Ketapal to Lindy Hop from Ballroom's

[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:45.760]
Disagent Screen.

[00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:51.420]
It's had Cynthia Milman, who co-owned, who co-wrote Manning's self titled 2007 memoir.

[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:54.260]
Frankie Musselhead Manning.

[00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:57.680]
Never heard of him.

[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:57.920]
Did you?

[00:57:59.520 --> 00:57:59.900]
No.

[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:00.680]
What's that?

[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:02.880]
That's some swing music just for the occasion.

[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.380]
I'm going to do the Lindy Hop here.

[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.680]
Yeah, hop on it.

[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.140]
That's what Joe Bell said.

[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:08.720]
Hop on it.

[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:09.660]
Jump on Z.

[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:19.140]
That nothing?

[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:20.120]
Yeah.

[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:25.400]
Dana, who's really getting on my nerves, you know, chronic.

[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:31.480]
Dana says yesterday we're discussing awful sports casters calling games.

[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:36.220]
One for a poll should include Jean Deckerhoff, voice of the Tampa Bay Yucks.

[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.080]
He is in my humble opinion by far the worst.

[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.760]
Absolutely incorrect wrong.

[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.260]
Jean Deckerhoff, I haven't heard him in years, but he used to be great.

[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.880]
He did all the FSU sports on the radio and he did the bucks.

[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:46.680]
He's done it for years.

[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:51.620]
I guarantee you, Jean Deckerhoff is 80,000 times better than Jimmy Syphilitic.

[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:54.020]
I bet you're about $1,000 right now.

[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:58.860]
Jean Deckerhoff, my ass.

[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:01.340]
This is a guy who hates the bucks evidently.

[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:02.900]
So therefore, Jean Deckerhoff must suck.

[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:03.620]
I don't know.

[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:06.580]
I don't know what your problem is, Danny.

[00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:07.980]
Your taste is in your tukus.

[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.580]
James says, oh, here we go.

[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:13.680]
Love the show.

[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:16.660]
Unfortunately, I didn't get to listen much anymore since I worked during the day.

[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:21.140]
But a friend told me you mentioned the Chicago Black Hawk's last week, something about you

[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.580]
wanted to be in the locker room after a game.

[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.060]
Oh, yeah.

[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:25.740]
Well, my girlfriend used to live in Chicago.

[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.660]
She's very good friends with some of the hawks.

[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:29.240]
She talks a lot with Patrick Sharp.

[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.500]
She knows Kane and Taves fairly well too.

[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:33.360]
So which of the boys are your favorites?

[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:34.360]
Kane.

[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:35.820]
And I don't mean Steve.

[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:41.000]
I'm sure she can get you an autograph picture or something.

[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.340]
Or maybe she can ask them to set up a webcam in the locker room so you can watch post-game

[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:44.780]
highlights.

[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.320]
Just a guy trying to say thank you for all the years of entertainment and last year

[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:48.700]
given me.

[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:51.700]
Let's hope they finish off the flames tonight in Calgary 2 Go Hawks.

[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:52.980]
And they did four to one.

[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:54.580]
Bye, bye flames.

[00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:00.980]
That's a franchise I just can't warm up to so to speak the Calgary flames.

[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.560]
You know, they used to be the Atlanta flames.

[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.240]
You know who broadcast their games when they were the Atlanta flames?

[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.680]
Old jigs McDonald old hack.

[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:15.540]
He was in the car with Rimmer one day when he was doing the Panther games when he first

[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:16.080]
came to town.

[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.020]
And Rimmer of course had my show blasted on there and was kissing up to me by way of

[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:21.320]
jigs.

[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.940]
And somebody coincidentally called and asked me what I thought about jigs McDonald coming

[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.500]
to do the Panther games and I said he's an old hack.

[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.980]
Yeah, like you can imagine.

[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.780]
Can you imagine to look on Rimmer's push?

[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.240]
No.

[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:42.780]
Oh my good friend Neil, he's great.

[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.740]
He's a hockey maven.

[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:44.340]
Bum-bum-bum-bum.

[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.420]
And there's old jigs.

[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.560]
Old hack jigs.

[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.160]
Back to the island just man, a hundred years ago.

[01:00:56.100 --> 01:01:00.920]
See, this is the trap that we get into in this business is that you know we make a certain

[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:04.240]
amount of money and we survive a certain amount of time.

[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.140]
And then it's time to retire.

[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:10.660]
But a lot of us can't afford to retire like Ricky Tiki Shaw.

[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:14.300]
I never had a response after he sent me that to think about the phone calls.

[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:15.820]
Yeah.

[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.900]
Now you know, Bos floor to this guy sends me all the obituaries but Bos your great guy,

[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.960]
good emailer, I don't need obituaries about horses, okay?

[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:27.860]
Wow.

[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.840]
Here's one from Baron Fitz.

[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:39.800]
Uncle Neil, when this whole thing started with Joe Bell wanting to get rid of George, I was absolutely sure it was stick.

[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.360]
I thought nobody could be that stupid.

[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:46.900]
I mean, what kind of fat retarded douche bucket would even mess with the highest rate of show on a station?

[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:50.320]
You and George are a trapper island in the middle of a sea of radio crap.

[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:51.440]
Go away, Joe Bell.

[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.660]
Says Baron Fitz.

[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.460]
Go away, Joe Bell.

[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.400]
Do you think that's a great idea?

[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:02.400]
No, you don't have to comment.

[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:03.820]
Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.740]
I don't think anybody else is either.

[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:12.460]
That's because they got that George Sadauna on across this dream.

[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.040]
And whoever they got on, I don't know, I got some other nerd until noon.

[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:17.960]
Some turd.

[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.960]
Fake Larry Kings is, I can't understand why mad dog gets no ratings.

[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.560]
He's one of a kind talent as a great show.

[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.180]
To me, the problem is the mornings.

[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.480]
Joe Rose's mind numbing.

[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:33.780]
The big O is Howard Stern, but at least he has the common fan passion that's missing on some of the other shows.

[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:37.680]
The young Cuban wire in LeBaster for obvious reasons.

[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:41.220]
I think he means right in LeBaster.

[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:42.080]
I don't know what he's talking about.

[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:42.740]
The young Cubans.

[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.760]
Is an ethnic thing with LeBaster?

[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:46.060]
I don't know.

[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.520]
Remember, he said, we won the World Series, not the Marlin.

[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:48.940]
That's right.

[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:50.960]
We Cubans won the World Series.

[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:52.460]
That was a long time ago.

[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.160]
And he got away with it.

[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.660]
I was the only one who even commented on that.

[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.340]
It was one of the most egregious things ever written in the horrible pages of the Miami-Herald.

[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:01.900]
And nobody called them on it.

[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:08.460]
Kenny Rogers says, whatever happened to Kenny Rogers,

[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:09.800]
I thought he was coming to our stations.

[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.820]
He's on in the weekend or the one that they can't across the street.

[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:13.960]
I thought he was on the shuttle.

[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:17.320]
Wasn't he?

[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.440]
I guess.

[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:19.880]
No, I guess that was just a river.

[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:23.260]
He says, high-neil in George, you guys are gangster.

[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.400]
When my throat was really bad last year, I found those Ricola honey cough drops

[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.760]
with that echinaceous stuff and that f-n-crap work wonders.

[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:30.320]
Try some.

[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:30.880]
I've done it.

[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:31.660]
Don't work.

[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:32.980]
Do it.

[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.500]
Just do it.

[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.380]
If you guys watched the Obama Deception movie,

[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:38.340]
a friend of mine just told me about it.

[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.020]
I know you don't like links, but when you guys get a second,

[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:44.180]
on your own time, please go to YouTube and type in the Obama Deception

[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.240]
and prepare to have your minds blow away.

[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:50.820]
The film, this film exposes the Bilderberg group

[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:53.700]
and the possibility of a centralized bank.

[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:58.000]
Furthermore, it educates us on the realities behind the Kennedy assassination,

[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.080]
the Social Security scandal and a bunch of other interesting topics.

[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.980]
Sounds like Kenny Rogers is the right-wing lunatic.

[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.000]
Maybe.

[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.520]
Michael with the territory, sports nerds, right-wing lunatics.

[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:11.780]
So I've heard.

[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.240]
It was a mistake.

[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.820]
It was a setup, he said.

[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:17.000]
The Kenny Rogers.

[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:17.840]
Yeah, it was a setup.

[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.100]
Life is a setup.

[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.780]
And of course, Joe Bell, he's just waiting to set you up.

[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:26.740]
He's probably going to have somebody with like four pounds of weed

[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:29.280]
under their arms waiting by your car one day when you go out here,

[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:29.800]
or have a car.

[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.020]
Okay?

[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.000]
Just keep that in mind, okay?

[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:35.620]
Okay.

[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.920]
The fat man is out to get your ass.

[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:40.740]
I'm getting a little tired of that crap.

[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:41.780]
I can tell you right now.

[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.420]
Ah!

[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.320]
I need a black magic marker.

[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:04.360]
You got a black magic marker.

[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:11.840]
It's the black magic marker, I'm right better speaking up to you.

[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:19.840]
I need a black magic marker and my eyes are so bad I can't see

[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:27.820]
Keep the cap on a baby The cap keeps it from fading

[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:35.660]
Don't lose the cap, boy baby It keeps the boister as the ink

[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:43.060]
I like it threshold and baby I can help the boat in Parker's Sea

[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.020]
Oh, that's it! Trick ending, I hate that, don't you?

[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:53.620]
Well, at least it ends with that, as opposed to just ending like somebody else

[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:54.440]
Watch here that again

[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:58.640]
Get it back it up? I'm back it up

[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.640]
I hope that...

[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:09.740]
I like it threshold and baby I can help the boat in Parker's Sea

[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:15.800]
Oh! What was that? What was that sound I just heard?

[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.240]
I didn't hear anything, I heard Henry Barrow

[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.900]
Boss Florida says Gene's build his FSU games and I agree he's good

[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.700]
He's damn good, Gene Decker-Haw

[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:28.280]
I mean here's a market where we got Joseph Gackie doing hurricane sports

[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:33.860]
Jimmy Cifillitic doing the dolphins and we got Rich Walls pretending to do the Marlins

[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:39.500]
Marlins and we got Red Deer Randy Silly Smoor doing the Panther games and they're not

[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.480]
Can Gene Decker-Hawth?

[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:45.420]
Boy, something's wrong with this picture

[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.260]
Something really, really wrong

[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:53.040]
So what do you think about that Spine Hoon flu, huh?

[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:54.720]
What about it?

[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.120]
Lissette says, hey Neil, I'm so glad you're sounding better today

[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:01.460]
I know how you feel as I just got over a cold I know how hard it is to get completely rid of it

[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:02.660]
Here that they're coming for me

[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.200]
Well, anyways, glad you're feeling better

[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.400]
Tell Jolly Joda Bug Off because you enjoy Georgia great

[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.500]
Yeah, Bug Off Jolly Joda, that's gonna do a lot of good

[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.500]
I love your show when you guys give me through my work day

[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.400]
I also enjoy it a good job while you're out of town

[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.820]
Keep up the great work and don't let Joe get you down

[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:18.540]
This is Lissette, thanks Lissette

[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.000]
Yeah

[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.140]
Kevin says, hey Neil, Mandage can take solace in this

[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:30.340]
Whenever Le Bastard takes a day off and Stu gots alone does the show

[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.860]
The dial immediately is turned to 560 and Mandage

[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:35.500]
Between the Marlins preempting to end show half the week

[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.660]
And Stu gots when he tries to do a show by himself

[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:40.800]
These factors should help Mandage and Future trans during the afternoon

[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:45.640]
How is it possible that anyone lets Stu gots on the air when people are awake?

[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.660]
Excellent point

[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:51.440]
Le Bastard is funny as a talent but he'll be fighting a losing battle against Stu in the Marlins

[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.020]
Love you Neil, George Stays, periods is Kevin

[01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:55.100]
You stay, period

[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:57.380]
Well, thank you

[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:00.060]
Gosh dang it

[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:09.200]
You know, Charlie Christ your um, limperous gay governor says don't like the Jesus plate, don't buy it

[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.460]
Oh, well then

[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:18.280]
Earlier in the day, Western Democratic Senator Nan Rich said she would urge governor Charlie Christ to veto proposed license plates

[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:22.380]
That depicted Jesus and that depicted a cross in front of a stained glass window

[01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:26.480]
Asked about whether he'd veto the legislation, Christ said no way

[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.860]
I would not veto those, no I would not Christ said

[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:32.140]
So you don't have a problem with Jesus on a license plate, Christ, no I don't know

[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.300]
What about separation of church and state, Christ, if they don't want one, they don't have to buy one

[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.100]
Is that state endorsement of religion?

[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:44.160]
I think what is it saying God we trust in every single piece of monetary coins and paper

[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:48.960]
We have I think it's fine says your gay governor Charlie Christ hypocrite phony faker

[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:57.080]
Suck it up to his Republican base, you know, yep his naive government Republican base for a two foolish to realize that he's a screamer

[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:57.720]
GAY

[01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:58.760]
Flamer

[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:00.620]
FAMI

[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:03.020]
Somebody got married, you know, yeah that proves it to me

[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.140]
So did Tony Perkins

[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.460]
So did David Cassidy

[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.980]
So did Elton John get married remember that?

[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.040]
Yeah, oh yeah

[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:17.300]
Wow

[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:21.620]
Here's the poor result, let me print it out, I don't want to read it off of this thing

[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:24.400]
Can I do that? Please

[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.320]
I'm making a nice comeback, I'll tell you that

[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:30.860]
Sound queer as a belt, I do

[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.520]
You're fairer, yeah

[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:38.000]
Okay, I'm printing out the poll result, it's my mighty important crap

[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.560]
I wish I would have been at that meeting yesterday, I wonder if they went to lunch

[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.600]
I would have brought my botulism with me

[01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:51.380]
Looks like jelly

[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:53.140]
For Joe and Norma

[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.620]
488 votes on the poll, the most annoying habit other people can do it in my presence is

[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.340]
He mid-bad breath or BO

[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:02.180]
Ugh, 116

[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:04.440]
Smelly old Chinese man

[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.740]
Two with their mouth open, 58

[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:08.120]
Pick their nose, 56

[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.360]
Fart, 49

[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.640]
Have a loud cell phone conversation, 34

[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.160]
Spit on the ground, 28

[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.140]
Spit while talking, 28

[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.720]
Chugam Noisily, 26

[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.520]
Scratch their balls, 16

[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.540]
Whistle, 13, home, 12

[01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:25.880]
Crack their knuckles, 10

[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.640]
Wow, nice

[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:36.120]
Sneeze eight, cough eight, pick their T-6, scratch their butt five, burp five

[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:41.660]
Bite their nails for each sloppy three, jingle their keys three

[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:47.460]
Is that kind of like a signal when people guys jingle their keys?

[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.400]
Is it like when they were the red-hanky and the left-back pocket or the other?

[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.760]
I don't know how that goes, tap their foot

[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.940]
Oh, it's the tap their foot and the stall

[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.920]
Gay, wow, just yell out

[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.440]
You fairer

[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:00.060]
And then run like a son of a bitch, could be Larry

[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.680]
There's the president

[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.440]
And part of what makes the FBI so unique is its ability to adapt

[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.680]
Oh, speaking of gay, how about gay at your Hoover?

[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.000]
How could we make him out of them out of the mix?

[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.980]
Don't you love that expression, that's another stupid

[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:25.440]
So and so is, they use that in Goffa law, when they're reading the leaderboard, you know?

[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:26.780]
No, I don't know

[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:28.160]
And so and so is in the mix

[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:31.580]
Well, what the hell does that mean?

[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.760]
I mean, I know what they are trying to say, but what are they?

[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:34.780]
Oh

[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:39.260]
So many stupid expressions in so little time

[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:47.080]
And now we get to Shfinheon flu when the economy is falling apart

[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:51.580]
And they're telling everybody to stay home and don't fly and don't travel and oh my god

[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:56.780]
I'm going to start hoarding nickels and pennies and dimes

[01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:57.600]
All right

[01:11:58.740 --> 01:11:59.780]
In my mattress

[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.480]
Oh, ought to be comfy

[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:04.700]
No, under the mattress, you know

[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:08.200]
The part between the mattress and the box spring, whatever

[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.140]
Under the mattress?

[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:10.960]
Yeah

[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:16.040]
Well, you sure slowed down on these emails, I'll tell you that, Neil at Nearoges.com

[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:19.460]
See that? I might actually have a relapse

[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.160]
Nearoges

[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:25.620]
Hi y'all, it's Britney Spears with another blog update

[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:30.840]
Well, I'm here with my new boyfriend, he's a backup dancer on my tour

[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.880]
What up?

[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:37.400]
And we're about to watch an important speech from President Obama, turn on the TV, babe

[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.840]
Americans have much to be proud of

[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:51.400]
All forces on the drop of the devil, the economy is getting back on track and Britney Spears is K-E-R

[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:57.680]
Did I hear what I think I heard? The economy is back on track? That's awesome

[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:03.240]
Oh, seniorista Britney, oh, hi, consuela, she's my housekeeper, y'all

[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:12.220]
See, seniorista Britney, yo tengo un mensaje más importante, English please consuela, oh, lo siento, yor-

[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:13.420]
... is hanging out

[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:17.320]
Chris is dang, I didn't even know she spoke English

[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:19.860]
Babe, I think she said you're f***ing hanging out

[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:23.680]
Oh, I'm J, so embarrassing, let me step this back in

[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:28.800]
Okay, that's it for today's blog, T-T-Y-L-Y-O

[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:29.580]
Oh, yeah, y'all

[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:31.980]
I'm just printing something out

[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:35.680]
Mark and West Palm says, fire George Ponderous

[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:40.300]
This is all flaming a-hole Joe Belko come up with, why doesn't somebody fire his ass?

[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:44.120]
Glad you're sounding better, Neil, and George delivers the top-notch product as always

[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.900]
Is your friend Mark and West Palm? How do you like that?

[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.180]
I think Mark, I didn't even know I had one

[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:48.100]
How do I boy, Mark?

[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:55.580]
The fake Superman says, I have two movie suggestions for both you and George and we've both seen both of them

[01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:00.840]
Bill Maher is religious and zeitgeist, which has been on our website for months and months and months right

[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:05.180]
Both movies debunk religion and zeitgeist gets into many secrets of the government

[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:10.500]
For George, there's a torrent for zeitgeist on their website, but we got it on our website

[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:14.340]
Says the fake Superman, okay, thanks, faker

[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:22.400]
Only 16 till noon, my god, just because my voice came back, don't mean I'm ready to do four hours

[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.200]
Fire and peg and mustard the wonder dog, remember them from Moridian Idaho?

[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:30.160]
Yes, how could you forget? Oh, and I got to play a thing too

[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.000]
One moment please

[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:38.060]
Neil, today is my birthday, the big 55

[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:42.180]
I've been listening for over half my life, thanks for the laughs, keep it coming

[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:45.760]
I'm starting to catch up with you, Neil, it's not bad becoming an old man

[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.520]
Yes, it is, that's my advice to all you people don't ever get old

[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:52.940]
Joe Bell is an ass clown, George must stay, you guys making great team

[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:57.620]
The media is going crazy about this wine flu, around 35,000 people each year with a flu

[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.680]
When it starts getting like 19, 18, 18, so we should start worrying

[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:06.280]
And of course, back in 1918, they didn't have antibiotics and stuff, you know

[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:09.100]
Right, mass media, all of these

[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:11.080]
All of these are in the mass hysteria

[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.920]
Yeah, mass hysteria, that's what we need

[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:15.040]
Everybody pay

[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:22.200]
When in question or end out, run in circles, scream and shout

[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:24.920]
AHHHHH

[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.760]
Dear Neil, I don't know what that guy is talking about, Gene Decker-hoff is a great

[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:31.140]
Is great compared to the coma inducing Joe Zagaki

[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:36.240]
Honestly, how long is he going to ride the sympathy train for that horrible plan accident where he was the only survivor?

[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:41.360]
That doesn't mean he's fit to broadcast UM Sports on the radio, UM should spend some bucks in a real broadcast

[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:47.380]
Well, that's what I'd say about Gene Decker-hoff, he ain't no Joe Zagaki, thank God

[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.620]
And you would say the same if you knew who Gene Decker-hoff was

[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:56.060]
Steve in Kendall says

[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:03.760]
My ex-wife was from former East Germany and was well versed in the Urb-Lor of Europe

[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:10.700]
When I got cold, she prescribed teammate of Lyndon Leaves, time, Spitz-Wegrich and Kohl's Foot

[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:14.580]
Lyndon and time are easy to get, time is my favorite

[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:18.680]
And we'll really clean out your sinuses and get rid of any nasty cough

[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.460]
It's highly antiseptic, time-alls and active ingredient and listerine and kicks butt

[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.720]
Well, how do you like that? Thanks, Stephen Kendall, a rat

[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.420]
I got a big good jug of listerine in my bathroom

[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:32.340]
Do you know? Do you think I ought to be garling with it a little bit?

[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:33.820]
A little bit, why not? Can't hurt

[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.080]
I don't like garling

[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:38.720]
It's not what I heard

[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.760]
I'm telling you, it makes you nauseous

[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.080]
You don't get nauseous, garling?

[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.200]
If you do it wrong

[01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:50.660]
Oh, here's an article, the general art of changing Jewish names and it goes on, it's about eight billion words long

[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:51.700]
Wow, is there a sister?

[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.540]
Oh, that's right up my alley, Sally

[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.800]
Although I don't want to be reading a lot of long ponderous stuff today

[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:00.180]
Bronson was a Lithuanian

[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.420]
It says a Lithuanian, Lipka

[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.220]
Tatar, the sinner, which would make him a Sunni Muslim

[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:13.740]
He was born in the Pennsylvania cool town, young as the 15 children, they were dirt poor

[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:17.800]
Well, all kinds of conflicting stories about Charles Bronson

[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.160]
He was Jewish, he was Goyish

[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.020]
Oh, Dana

[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:26.600]
Dana comes back with this anti-gene decarhoff crap

[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:32.940]
It's really, it's almost funny, it would be funny if it weren't so sad

[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:36.840]
Let's see the defensive is idiotic comments

[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:42.420]
This general art of changing Jewish names, this goes on for like 400 pages

[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:42.740]
Great

[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:48.340]
Wow, go on, buy some more facts paper, maybe it's a good thing I got a case

[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:50.040]
A case of what?

[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.240]
Flu, oh, Shfinhun Flu

[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:59.040]
Dana says the reason I don't care for gene decarhoff is because he makes a

[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:03.880]
3 yard gain sound like an 80 yard run for a score, sorry to be chronic

[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.340]
I'll just listen and leave you and then soon departing George alone

[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:12.280]
Why not just off Joe Bell and George who his excellent can stick around? Love the show never to lose Dana

[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:19.200]
Oh, I, what is there to say?

[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:25.440]
To each his own, I mean you're entitled to your opinion just happen to be bad wrong on gene decarhoff but that's where it goes

[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:30.040]
This is the business we have chosen

[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:36.360]
He mid bad breath or BO122 that seems to be winning hands down your pants

[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.380]
Two with their mouth open, 59

[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:42.160]
Pick their nose, 57, fart, 51, 52

[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:45.920]
In fact if we get the fart sounds back we could change the logo of the station

[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.440]
fart 56, I like it

[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:50.180]
Fart 56

[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.020]
Who? What was that?

[01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:55.400]
I don't know

[01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.880]
Oh this is from Oishmoiju

[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:07.900]
It is one, two, three, four, five, six pages long

[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:08.900]
Wow

[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:11.260]
Oh

[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:16.280]
I'll read a little bit of it, okay? Okay

[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:20.000]
See see see if it's assimilating enough for us to take it all the way through

[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:24.180]
You think? Let's take it for a test drive

[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:30.700]
The Medanski brothers max Solomon Benjamin and Jacob have written that their names henceforth will be May

[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:36.020]
It's the good old Anglo-Saxon name but the Medanskis are of Ageotic origin

[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:40.220]
Elmo Lincoln a movie actor comes in with LA court on the motion of his wife

[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.960]
And it's discovered that he is only auto-linked

[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:48.020]
A large department's their owner was born with the name Levy he now is known as Litten

[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.900]
It's quite possible he didn't like Levy as a name

[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:55.780]
Why did he change it for another Jewish name? Or perhaps it was the Jewishness of Levy that just placed him

[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:59.100]
Like Lipschitz, Birrenbaum and Goldberg

[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:03.540]
A popular tenor star recently bought suit against his wife

[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:06.680]
Who married him after allowing him to believe she was of Spanish origin

[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:10.680]
I understood from her misleading stage name that she was Spanish when I married her

[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.340]
Later I found out she was Jewish and a real name was Bergenstein

[01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:17.700]
I wonder if she was kin to stand Bergenstein

[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:22.680]
One of the big... this goes on and on and on

[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.880]
Well, I'll just read a little bit just till the show's over

[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:30.720]
One of the biggest investment on stores in the US goes under an honored Christian name

[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:31.980]
Though every one of the owners is Jewish

[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:36.260]
The public still carries a mental picture of the good old merchant who established the store

[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:39.880]
Which picture would speedily change if the public could get a glimpse of the real owners

[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.120]
Take the name Belmont for example and trace its history

[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:47.820]
Prior to the 19th century the Jewish residents in Germany didn't use family names

[01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:53.420]
It was Joseph the son of Jacob, Isaac Ben Abraham, the son being designated the son of his father

[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:59.240]
But in the Napoleonic era especially following upon the assembly of the great San Hedron under Napoleon's command

[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.860]
Because the distinct change in Jewish customs in Europe

[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:06.500]
In 1808 Napoleon sent out a decree commanding all Jews without family names

[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:11.360]
And Austria list of surnames was assigned to the Jews and if the Jew was unable to choose the state chose for him

[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:18.880]
The names were devised from precious stones as Rubenstein, precious metals such as Goldstein, Silverbird, plants, trees and animals such as

[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.600]
Mandelbaum, Luleanthal, Ox, Wolf and Lowe

[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:28.560]
The German Jews created surnames by the simple method of affixing the syllable son to the father's name

[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:33.640]
Thus making Jacobson, Isaacson while others adopted the names of localities in which they lived

[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:38.620]
The Jewish resident in Berlin becoming Berliner and the Jewish resident in Oppenheim becoming Oppenheimer

[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:43.380]
Are you finding this mildly interesting? I'm actually finding it fascinating

[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:45.960]
Are you? I love this very much

[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:53.120]
Oh, God, I may have most of my voice back but this is going to be the end of it

[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.740]
I think Oishmoj Jew is a plot, it's a plot

[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:03.540]
Now in the region of Schoenberg in the German Ryan country a settlement of Jews had lived for several generations

[01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:08.440]
When the order to adopt surnames went forth Isaac Simon, head of the settlement chose the name of Schoenberg

[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:15.080]
It signifies in German beautiful hill, it is very easily fragified into Belmont which also means beautiful hill or mountain

[01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:19.760]
A Columbia University professor once tried to make it appear that Belmont originated in the Belmont

[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:23.980]
He's family of Portugal but found it impossible to harmonize this theory with the Schoenberg facts

[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:27.760]
It is not worthy that a Belmont became American agent of the Rothschilds

[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:33.020]
And that the name of Rothschild is derived from the Red Shield on a house in the Jewish quarter of Frankfurt on the main

[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:34.120]
Yeah, I heard that story

[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:39.000]
Why the original family name? What the original family name has never been divulged

[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.460]
The Jewish habit of changing names is responsible for the immense camouflage that has concealed the true character of Russian events

[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:54.640]
When Leon Bronstin became Leon Liotratsky and when the Jewish Afro-Bombe becomes the Russian Zion's viv

[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:59.740]
And when the Jewish colon becomes the Russian Volodarsky and so on down through the list of controllers of Russia

[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:03.380]
Golden and becomes Isgwev and Friedman become Flotter Mirov

[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:06.880]
It's difficult for people to think that names do not lie to see just what's transpiring

[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:10.000]
What does that mean? I don't know

[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:18.780]
Indeed, there is any amount of evidence that in a number of cases this change of names or adopting of cover names as the Jewish description is for purposes of concealment

[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:25.740]
There is an immense difference in the state of mind in which a customer enters the store of Isgwev and the state of mind in which he enters the store of Alex May

[01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:36.060]
And what would be his feelings were in that Isgwev painted up the name of Alex

[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:45.860]
May with that state of mind and view when Rosenbluth and Schlesinger becomes the American mercantile company there's justification for the feeling that the name of American is being used to conceal the Jewish character of the firm

[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:55.180]
The tendency for Jews to change their names dates back very far there was and there is a superstition that to give a sick person of the name is to change his luck

[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.700]
And save him from the misfortune destined upon his old name

[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:07.260]
There was also the biblical example of a change of nature being followed by a change of name as when Abraham became Abraham and Jacob became Israel

[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:13.880]
There's nothing in here about when the Udelevic became a Solomon

[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.300]
Well, you can tell us that story yourself

[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:17.160]
Yeah

[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:22.380]
Like grandparents, they didn't want to be so conspicuously Jewish when they came from Russia

[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:26.900]
So when they came from the old country they changed their name from Udelevic to Solomon

[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:30.040]
Aight

[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:39.220]
A Polish Jew named Zuckermandol emigrating to Hungary would be anxious to show that he had shuffled off the Polish allegiance which his name proclaimed

[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:45.000]
And the only way he could do this would be to change his name which would like to become a Zuckor, a perfectly good Hungarian name

[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:48.840]
Originally the Zuckors were not Jews now the usual guess would be that they are

[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:56.000]
In the US it would be almost a certainty such a change as Mr. Zuckermandol would make however would not be for the purpose of concealing the fact he was a Jew

[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.320]
But only to conceal the fact that he was a foreign Jew

[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:02.980]
Oh, this just I don't know about you but it was pretty interesting the first five million words

[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:03.380]
Yeah

[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:10.460]
It goes on and on and on and on until I stop reading

[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:17.600]
This is pretty quick whatever I shape my balls I listen to the Neil Rogers 12 to 1 hour

[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:22.480]
Real American a-holes

[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:25.680]
Real American a-holes

[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:26.860]
We salute you

[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:30.200]
Mr. Karaoke host at the neighborhood bar guy

[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:32.960]
Mr. Karaoke host at the neighborhood bar guy

[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:36.320]
You'll lug your crap around my death tonight

[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:40.620]
Just so some drunken slob can butcher piano man

[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:42.400]
It's high the fr-

[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.420]
You can do ice- up

[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:46.460]
Your equipment is state of the art

[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:49.300]
Your Karaoke collection is the best

[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:54.680]
But you are 42 years old and you still live with mother

[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:56.640]
How did it bring me my tape?

[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.640]
You fancy yourself as an entertainer

[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:05.260]
But does it really take any talent to introduce Sue and Josh singing Magaritaville?

[01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:07.580]
Where's the song where's the song now?

[01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:11.900]
Sure your cushy gif means you meet a lot of chicks

[01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:16.300]
But they all smell like hot wings and look like John Madden

[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:21.800]
So we salute you Mr. Karaoke host at the neighborhood bar guy

[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:27.000]
You're my space page, you're nine volt batteries and you're posted notes

[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.560]
You are a real American a-hole

[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.940]
Provo one at five sixty WQ I am happy Tuesday to you

[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:35.880]
We got the big O rock solid

[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:36.560]
At two o'clock

[01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:40.820]
Now somebody sends me a copy of this

[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.060]
I think I read it once before

[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.940]
Posted February 22nd 2009

[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.580]
Letter to the editor, the hurricane reader, the UM or newspaper

[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:51.340]
The hurricane?

[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:52.340]
Yes

[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:57.420]
At any rate

[01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:00.680]
It says most people can agree that hurricane athletic is second to none

[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:01.960]
I don't agree with that but nevertheless

[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:07.520]
The list reads like a resume, five national football championships, four baseball national championships

[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:09.180]
And countless of words in other sports

[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:12.260]
However there's one award you will never hold for a long time

[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:14.280]
And that's the word for college broadcasters

[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:19.520]
In fact I'm more than willing to say that UM has the worst broadcasters among all division one schools

[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:22.780]
Therefore I believe Joe Zagaki should be in the unemployment line

[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:28.360]
Zagaki is affectionately known to his few and I do use the word few loosely fans as Joe

[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:33.000]
And is the main play by play voice for a football basketball and the occasional baseball game

[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:36.880]
Listening to Zagaki call a game is like nails against the blackboard

[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:40.740]
There are times when I've avoided listening to hurricane games on radio because of Zagaki

[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:46.400]
His voice is so monotone and when he tries to yell he sounds like a person who needs to use the mechanical larynx

[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.200]
Because he lost his original one to the smoking

[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:56.500]
Zagaki's voice is so bad it's gotten him major notoriety from such radio personalities that Dan La Bastard and WQM veteran Near Rogers

[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:02.640]
There's no requirement of being friendly in this line of work and Zagaki make sure that he doesn't fit the bill

[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:08.360]
As one former co-worker of Zagaki told me, Joe is a cold person because he's constantly looking over his shoulder

[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.140]
Thinking somebody will take his job

[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:17.600]
Zagaki's unprofessional conduct also got him into trouble when he confronted WQM and answers after a baseball game last May

[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:19.040]
You made a mistake!

[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:20.520]
I wonder what that was about

[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:21.160]
I don't know

[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:27.480]
My question is, who's asses Zagaki kissing the keeper's job as the voice of one of the proudest universities in the country?

[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:32.020]
I was surprised to not find one person who said they enjoyed listening to WQM's broadcast

[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:35.820]
Someone even further saying they would rather listen to WQM and sit as Zagaki

[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:40.940]
There are several candidates out there where I think it would be more than qualified to be the new voice of the hurricanes

[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:47.700]
Dave Lamont, Jeremy Mark, I already read this, Jeremy Mark's peltz, who's the guy across the street I guess

[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:53.980]
In the meantime, Zagaki should probably line up for a job at Don Bailey Carpid with that other stooge who thinks he's an analyst

[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.980]
Wow, pretty scathing from Paul Thompson

[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:00.560]
Doctorate, man!

[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.660]
Joseph Gaki sucks, okay?

[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:04.340]
Well, we haven't heard

[01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:05.200]
Doctorate, man!

[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.080]
Wow, so you know, he can never play it too much

[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:13.460]
Almost all companies have a stated policy says this email

[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:17.680]
And if you work for them, you're not allowed to work for a direct competitor after working a part-time basis

[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.500]
Most radio and TV personalities only work for one station or channel

[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:24.720]
I have never seen a radio and TV commentator work at two stations

[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:28.660]
WQA and Jimmy Cifalus seem to be the exception

[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:33.200]
Jimmy Cifalus is a broadcast with an offense games on WQM with Joe Rosenmandage

[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:36.760]
Then Jimmy Cifalus during the weekdays has a show on 6-10 in morning drive hours

[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:40.520]
Which is prime time for WQM's audience of males 25-54

[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:43.520]
And direct competition with his partner for the offense games Joe Rose

[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:46.720]
How does Jimmy Cifalus get away with it?

[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:51.480]
What was it in his contract that the dolphins want Cifalus as their analyst and radio broadcast with their games?

[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:54.120]
Or is it total incompetence in the part of WQM management?

[01:29:54.900 --> 01:30:01.920]
What does Joe Bell do instead of trying to get rid of Cifalus who's taking markets here in thousands of dollars in advertising revenue from WQM and Warning Drive?

[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:06.100]
Joe Bell is trying to fire a George who probably makes less than 50 grand a year

[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:13.080]
You're always talking in your show about how evil Joe Bell is quite frankly I thought you were exaggerating to make your show exciting

[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.820]
Believe me we don't need this kind of excitement

[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:19.780]
But with Joe Bell trying to fire George I have to believe that you're right

[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:22.940]
Joe Bell is an evil person I enjoy your show very much

[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:25.820]
Lot's hang over the same word as yesterday which I won't read again

[01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.220]
They get help

[01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:29.020]
Yeah in La Punta

[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:30.760]
So what's the Punta?

[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:32.500]
Punta Gordon

[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:34.160]
What's the point?

[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:38.260]
We're here we show up that's all we can do

[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:44.720]
Oh my God, Neil look at the bottom of the page on the previous email on Jewish names

[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:46.980]
The date 1921 from Dearborn Michigan

[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.460]
Henry Ford's hometown

[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:02.920]
He was the biggest Jew hater of his time Henry Ford virulent that by semi

[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:05.160]
The article indicates we change our names to commit

[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:12.480]
To commit fool the goyem sheep can you fool a fool to commit fool the goyem sheep what does that mean?

[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:12.920]
Dota

[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:18.260]
Neil spare me

[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:27.340]
Fred and Boca I got Fred Thompson on 1420 worn out records on FM and yours drives the mojabi desert today

[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:32.700]
I'm dry today with Elizabeth me as opposed yesterday you were really wet

[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:37.840]
Yeah I guess you liked it better yesterday when it's coughing and choking and puking couldn't talk

[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:41.260]
God

[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.280]
So tough world out there man

[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:50.920]
Yep

[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:58.040]
I think what we ought to do is have a big suicide party in Joe Bell can be the he can be the ringleader

[01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:00.060]
He can be the pivot man

[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:06.800]
You know it's like guys who want to play Russian roulette you first oh geez like that

[01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:17.140]
And it just gets and when you think it can't get any worse light like this totally out of the blue unnecessary meeting

[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:23.360]
That Norma can't head with Joe Bell yesterday accomplish nothing other than to stir up all this crap about Joe wants to fire George again

[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:24.600]
That's all that accomplished

[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:29.380]
Yeah and the thing about how when the new rating system comes they're going to screw everybody as usual

[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:35.740]
Oh if you think you're going to make any more money on these bonuses you're dreaming Chris will never make any in the first place

[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:39.920]
So as they say it may be kind of a moot point

[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:45.380]
Oh here's another death somebody I never heard of and I'm sure you didn't

[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:51.100]
You know one thing about Howard cosine O'Dave Johnson hated him like poison and a lot of other people did too

[01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:58.580]
But he had balls man he made a big part of his living broadcasting boxing matches

[01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:05.880]
He called some of the biggest fights in history of boxing and he was the one guy in the sports world who had the balls to say that boxing was barbaric

[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:08.100]
And should have been banned a long time ago

[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:11.920]
You're not impressed?

[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:14.380]
I heard that story

[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:17.400]
I don't know impressed if the is the right word

[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:19.540]
And should be impressed takes balls to do that

[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:28.820]
Okay yeah Greg Paige a former heavyweight boxing champion suffered a severe brain injury in injury in a 2001 fight has died at his Louisville home he was 50

He died of complications related to injuries he suffered in the fight

[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:46.580]
Paige told the AP or husband is in a better place now you know I used to laugh at people who said that

[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:52.500]
Yeah now I'm beginning to agree he's in a better place now

[01:33:55.180 --> 01:34:03.060]
The March 2009 2001 fight left Paige in a coma for nearly a week he then had a stroke during post-fight surgery

[01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:07.020]
Which paralyzed him on his left side and he received intensive physical therapy

[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:15.400]
Paige won a 1.2 million dollar settlement in 2007 with Kentucky boxing officials over the lack of medical personnel at the fight

[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:25.960]
Boxing officials also agreed to establish your medical review panel for the Kentucky boxing and wrestling authority to check the health conditions that people involved in the sport who may be at risk for injury

[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:32.620]
You want the best example take a look at Mohamed Ali

[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:36.620]
He's looking at these days any that's a good

[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.940]
Paige and boy I must be psychic

[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:45.020]
Paige started fighting while growing up in Louisville and was sparring with Mohamed Ali by the time he was 18

[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:51.580]
He became the national golden loves heavyweight champion 1978 AIDS 20 now he's dead he only lived to 50

[01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:59.160]
He turned to professional boxing lost his first shot at the WBA WBA heavyweight championship in 84 to Tim Witherspoon

[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:04.660]
And he's December that year Paige knocked out Jerry Coatsy in the eighth round of their bout in South Africa claim the title

[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:12.720]
But lost on points to Tony Tubbs five months later Tony Tubbs and that a great name yes it is they call it in this boxing through 93

[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:16.800]
Two years after being knocked out by Bruce Selden he started again in 96

[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:23.820]
Paige was 42 yada yada yada yada I wouldn't care about his let's see

[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:31.500]
You had a 58 16 in one career record going to the $1,500 fight against Dale Crow at Pills Palace in Erlinger Kentucky near Cincinnati

[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:36.360]
Crow was 24 and upcoming boxer Paige went down after 10 rounds and didn't get up

[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:42.500]
He's fall he's fallen and he can't get up he'd be falling

[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:44.820]
Greg Paige is dead never heard him

[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:47.420]
Who?

[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.520]
Boxing guy oh I think I'm gonna have to rejoice here any minute

[01:35:52.640 --> 01:36:00.460]
Okay, it might be these halls I don't know might be all this crap. I'm suck. I could be you think it's possible anything is possible

[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:08.200]
More fights boxing dog fights. How's what's his name doing Michael Vicks? Oh, I don't know

[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:13.060]
Well, I'll tell you one thing last night I put Vicks under my nose and I smeared my neck really really good

[01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:17.600]
I mean I worked it in there my vocal to my voice box

[01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:23.960]
You think that helped I don't think it does help to be honest with that. I like it

[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:28.200]
I like it fine, but I think the Vicks and Hayler's what you need you need to inhale the fumes

[01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:30.720]
It all helps

[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:40.760]
I could breathe though. I'll say that that's why I slept good. I could breathe good it helps always helps your health when you can breathe a little bit

[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:45.960]
But I think the Vicks under your nose is a little it's a little bit annoying. I don't know

[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:50.640]
Maybe maybe I'm gonna get something smeared all over my head now you think because I'm going to woodbine it too

[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:54.580]
What about those the little inhalers the little stick things that you stick up your nose?

[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:01.940]

It's looks like a little tube. It's rounded at the end a little watch you a hole in there

[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:16.320]
I don't want to describe exactly what it looks like you get the picture and

[01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:26.120]
You sniff it you sniff what the tube. It's got a Vicks inside of it. Well Vicks and Hayler you're talking about I never heard of it

[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:33.760]

[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:37.580]

[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:52.900]
I will see to it that Joe Bell himself has made aware of your actions

[01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:55.700]

In 24 seconds

[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:19.540]
It's the longest day of my life

[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:23.220]
When evil Jonas orders at the I larried it with drop from Starkwood Larry complies

[01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:27.860]
But first helps Tony sneak away next Tony meets Stark with Jim and Doug who directs Tony to Starkwood's weapons lab

[01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:32.540]
And chief of staff Olivia learns journalist Ken has found out about the Starkwood weapons Olivia then sleeps with Ken and records

[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:34.820]
It's a prevent him from breaking the story now that's politics

[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:39.160]
Tony spots the weapons for the FBI dogs caught and killed by Jonas and president Taylor orders an air strike

[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:43.300]
Jonas detects the strike and calls Taylor to say how far missiles that these coasts that she won't turn the planes around

[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:47.520]
Taylor aborts the air strike but her admirals look more ready to fight than bodyguards that you sell and Tom Brady's wedding

[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.440]
Wow even Starkwood's afraid of those guys

[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:55.680]
Proves 17 at 560 WQM Senator Arlen Specter to switch parties. He's gonna become a Democrat

[01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:03.680]
Alrighty then ready for that. I'm ready. Maybe he's still looking for that magic bullet on the stretcher at Parkland Hospital in Dallas

[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:06.740]
Remember the magic bullet sure do I

[01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:12.800]
Think it's the same bullet that killed President Lincoln too. It gets around only bullet in history

[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:13.860]
They killed two presidents

[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:17.380]
Arlen Specter. I guess he wants to get reelected, huh?

[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:23.220]
Maybe they're gonna be a lot of Republicans switching the Democrats because everybody's running away from the Republican party

[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:25.420]
They're crazy people they always have been but now

[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:28.820]
But now that they took that weapon last November now they really lost it

[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:30.240]
Lost it

[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:37.240]
Running around with their damn tea bagging parties Larry Craig's doing a lot of tea bagging. I'm here. I heard toe tapping and tea bagging

[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.560]
Ernie says

[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:45.180]
Just heard there's one confirmed case of the swine flu in Orlando. It came on a flight from Mexico

[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:49.100]
Heard this from my fiance just a few minutes ago. Well, I haven't seen nothing about it on

[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:57.800]
Breaking news on CNN. I know some of the folks in this crowd are anti-abortion and they love this decision at least the group standing outside

[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:02.400]
Arlen Specter's office right now. Wow Lisa appreciate that Wow Arlen Specter

[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:04.980]

[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:07.240]
But nevertheless

[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:13.960]
You know any politicians who aren't grave robbers thieves no, no, no, I know

[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:26.600]
They're trickling in today boxes are much more skilled or counted than basket ball baseball football instead of a love your show says macho man

[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:31.020]
Oh, yeah, boxes are much more skilled boxing is for crazy people

[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:33.460]
The purpose of it is

[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:39.480]
It's hard to think that's right to inflict as much injury and punishment on the other person barbaric

[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:45.280]
Animals in the wild do those things people are supposed to be civilized, but of course we know they're not what it's supposed to be that's what's

[01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:52.180]
If somebody wants to be a boxer they know the risks involved who cares? It says look at NASCAR boxing is difficult and boxes are

[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:53.580]
Tounded from the same jackball

[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:55.140]
Boxes are talented

[01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:57.180]
Yeah

[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:01.400]
547 votes on that poll not too shabby

[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:05.660]

[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:11.440]
Come on people not anymore since they should make can Chris and stuck him did he ever get his check by the way?

[01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:15.720]
Yes, he said he sent you an email, but he sent it to an email account that you no longer check

[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:26.400]
What does that mean face my space? No, he sent you a thank you email to an email account that apparently you don't check very often

[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:33.200]
Or you would have seen it my space no, I don't have any other email account that I don't check okay

[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:37.360]
Why wouldn't he send it to the you one that we use on the show I told him to and

[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:43.580]
What are you saying okay? How's he doing just fine? I reckon he's still working. He's still got a job

[01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:46.420]
He's still here. Did you look at him say you still here? Yeah

[01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:55.160]
See I don't want to say this but I'm gonna say it anyway because you know me. I got a big mouth

[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.920]
Yeah, go ahead. I'll wait. No, I just gonna say this I

[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:07.040]
Mean it's so I'm so lucky I kissed the ground thanks to Greg Reed for one thing and that is allowing me to do the show outside of that studio and away from Miami

[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:14.400]
Yeah, because if I had to come in there and see certain people every day I there's no way I couldn't do it I

[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:18.180]
Couldn't deal with it

[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:22.500]
And that's why when they come to you with a happy face in a phony

[01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:27.580]
Glad hand I would spit on it and the hand too

[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:30.160]
Like that

[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:37.960]
In fact, you know something no, maybe I don't know anything maybe more like this

[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:45.380]
Like that should we especially if you have the Shfinnehon flew

[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:49.880]
Maybe I shouldn't have read that thing about his girlfriend told him this

[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:57.340]
I mean talk about unsubstantiated rumor irresponsible irresponsible. I shouldn't have read that all right take it back but I take it back

[01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:01.560]
I'll see if we can find verification of that okay, all right

[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.160]
What are people doing coming from Mexico anyway?

[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:15.060]
What do you mean? I'm not talking about the ones crossing the border of Texas. I'm talking about people flying

[01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:20.940]
Oh, you know people do that all the time they go through an indication not maybe crazy people. I don't know why

[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:28.160]
And hasn't there been enough murder and bloodshed in Mexico in the last several months all these gangs and all the drug

[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:31.760]
To go to the world's all the scrap people getting slaughtered oh

[01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:46.120]
No doubt and they come back with the surprise hey

[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:51.940]
We're not just talking about the monosumas revenge that used to keep a lot of people from going to Mexico

[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:56.720]
We're talking about the Lord's revenge God

[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:04.360]
What where did that expression come from monosumas revenge? I don't know a lot about Mexican history

[01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:10.540]
Okay, you really want to know no go ahead go ahead what go ahead, you know money

[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:16.300]
Zuma was the yeah, the Aztecs when the Spanish landed there mm-hmm

[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:19.620]
I think was Cortez that that finally toppled him over

[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:23.260]
Maybe Cortez. Yeah. Yeah. I hear you had a happy organ

[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.320]
So that's gonna give the Democrats one more vote in the Senate. Did you stop to think about that?

[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:35.540]
I just know he's one of the most senior Republican senators

[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:38.260]
And I was gonna become a Democrat I

[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:42.840]
Think they'd be public and parties on the way out. Gee. I'll hold my breath

[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:46.880]

Oh damn what are going to do that?

[01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:33.000]

Got bad news about one of my printer copy your fax machines. Oh, oh

[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:53.440]
I thought I must be down there because you faxed me these are copy stuff

[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:57.740]
Yes, and like the last page of the log it's like I'd black lines down it and

[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:03.120]
So what I did is I copied a clean page from something and I also had black line

[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:07.620]
So either I need a new toner just taking there which I got or a new drum which caused an arm and leg

[01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:12.860]
David and I'm gonna start expensing all those all these

[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:16.460]
Office supplies that I haven't charged in my time for the last seven years. That's right

[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:19.080]
New drums like two 300 bucks

[01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:26.100]
I witnessed news in Orlando is learned of Orlando's first confirmed case of swine flu

[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:30.480]
Thanks, Adam Oshmok see it coast to show you if you sit home all day

[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:34.680]
You got nothing to do eventually come up with something. Oh my god. It's the EBC new sounded

[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:41.620]
According to the chief medical officer of the Adventist Health System Loran Hauke the case was diagnosed this morning

[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:45.540]
We

[01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:50.520]
We hit Bruno Tateglia four o'clock this morning. I just love the way Tessio says that so sad

[01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:57.500]
Yeah, remember was it three o'clock this morning or four o'clock this morning close it up

[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:04.340]
So we got swine flu in Orlando, and I let me just say this to you. Okay, nobody panic. Nobody start getting crazy

[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.600]
And I'm still going to would buy it to a clock. I haven't been there for I don't know since Sunday morning

[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:11.980]
Tuesday swine

[01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:15.560]
What you're going to what's fine to get some flu?

[01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:23.680]
Now wouldn't that be a good case to get a place to catch something on I that did all those degenerates sitting side by each of those machines close to each other

[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:29.540]
coughing and puking and once the the first thing I do when I get home from wood buying is I wash my hands. I scrub them

[01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:36.160]
Because you're touching all the machines man

[01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:41.420]
People are sneezing and snotting and rubbing it on the machine on the buttons

[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:43.940]
Breathing all their lungs

[01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:45.260]
Yeah

[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:49.000]
Now who was it that was the recluse who um

[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:56.700]
That had all the money the famous recluse Howard Hughes. Howard Hughes. That's right. Very good with the jars of urine. Yeah

[01:50:57.960 --> 01:50:59.600]
The jaws of life. Yeah

[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:05.100]
Maybe he had it right although he had enough money to be able to do that. He had everything delivered right to the door

[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:06.080]
Right

[01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:16.540]
Anyway, Arlen Specter is going to join the Democratic Party was facing a real tough challenge he nearly got beaten the Republican Party in 2004

[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:21.980]
No mystery Republicans are angry with Specter over his recent vote in support of the president's

[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:23.520]
stimulus plan

[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:30.120]
Specter was one of only three GOP senators who voted for the measure and now he's become are gonna become a Democrat and it says

[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:36.820]
A Specter party switch will give Democrats a filibuster proof Senate majority of 60 seats if Al Franken holds his

[01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:39.620]
Currently in the disputed Minnesota Senate race which you will

[01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:44.880]
How do you like that goodbye Republican party? They're just out of touch man

[01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:49.980]
They're out of touch all they care about is Fagilas. That's all a half of them are. It's all they care about

[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:53.480]
Feetuses and Fagilas anything with an F so I say F them

[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.420]

[01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:07.820]

Chalala Jose is what I say. I don't think Greg read hated you personal. I think he hated you either like you on the

I disagree he hated you personally sure

[01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:30.900]
Why do you say that I could just feel it from the feedback that I got from everywhere?

[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:34.600]
Oh Georgia screwing up our summer book again

[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:39.640]
Yeah, is he the one to say that or other people? I think many girls said that the first year that I

Said in for you during the summer it was me and tapes and we got an eight two

[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:49.520]
Two points higher than whatever was in second place and certainly head and shoulders above everything else on station

[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:52.300]
And I tore pito the radio station was Greg reads commentary

[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:54.780]
I tore pito the entire station. That's why

[01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:56.160]

Faced a full rub bad for babies and young children can cause breathing problems somebody's sending this article

[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:15.500]
I agree with that if you put too much under your nose. It's like oh, I can't breathe all of a sudden

[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:27.340]
Now I don't understand this how I'll print it out

[01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:33.840]

When a building starts to

[01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:11.900]
I think what George ought to do is waltz right into joe bells desk when Joe comes back from lunch pull his pants down and take a big squat and dump on his desk

[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:15.280]
Okay, sure

[01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:22.120]
Health officials say no confirmed local cases of swine flu in Orlando

[01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:27.360]
So I witnessed news it says a report on wftv.com

[01:57:27.820 --> 01:57:33.320]
Shows a doctorate photo hospital confirmed the case of swine flu from a mexican tourist who visited walled Disney World

[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:38.240]
Officials at the Florida hospital said there are no confirmed cases of swine flu in central Florida

[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:45.400]
But state health officials said they've sent some flu like cases to the CDC for testing and this one said this and but a beep but a boop but about

[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:51.180]
I remember that with centino. Yep. What what do they say but a beep but a boop but a bi was good

[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:53.540]
He was great

[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:59.860]
Also was great in misery. Yep. I always like James Conn

[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:04.820]
Misery and deadbolt and rollerball didn't didn't have anybody in comment on the movie deadbolt

[01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:06.940]
I guess nobody seen it or else they hated it

[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:12.940]

We've released one suspect case that was sent to a state lab protesting

[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:27.200]
We're waiting to see what that is orange County Health Department spokesman Dan Weisman said there may be more than one case any

[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:29.180]
Influenza like cases are being sent and being looked at

[01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:32.080]

[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:34.220]
Fluency just yeah right flu season

[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:39.640]
Coincidence why is your said they haven't received any confirmation of a CDC about swine flu in central Florida

[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:46.660]
A report on wftv.com showed that a doctorate a Florida hospital confirmed a case of swine flu in a mexican tourist and walled Disney World

[01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:48.800]
But guess what no way Jose

And one flew over the kukus nest

[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:09.420]
Yeah, I think I'd like to see that recast with joe bill as a jack Nicholson character

[01:59:11.580 --> 01:59:16.420]
Only in this in this version of it nurse ratchet puts the a thing around his neck and she don't stop

[01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:21.960]

Chronic callers chronic emailers chronic anything chronic chronic be bad yep

[02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:11.080]
Oh, there's our own specter the new democrat into an independent and still caucus with Republicans

[02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:17.060]
But this is it's pretty big surprise and obviously you switching to be a democrat to be sure and what about the timing

[02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:21.440]
What do you make of the timing of this and and I guess the the first question is why

[02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:25.820]
Well, there's two mediums first and foremost he is up or a very tough

[02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:32.700]
Next year in Pennsylvania Pat to me a former Republican congressman from the Allentown area of Pennsylvania

[02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:35.760]
Very conservative he ran against him in respect to the primary

[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:43.840]
Five years ago in almost one he lost the primary only by about 10,000 votes and the respecter as you know voted for the stimulus package

[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:48.100]

You ever have a good pop roost just this morning

[02:01:03.380 --> 02:01:09.040]
The government overlords want to make everyone believe that they actually have a voice in selecting the rulers of the so-called great land

[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:10.620]
Be smart don't buy into it

[02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:14.280]
Because it's nothing more than a grand p-match. He doesn't say p-match

[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:15.060]
I can't say that word

[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:19.520]
Regardless of anyone's political affiliation give it a second look and think for yourself

[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:25.860]
Sorry guys had a voice on this one Dana Hall now. I won't be chronic. Just go away already. You're a crazy person

You're gonna you're not gonna believe this the state of Florida the mugwump state is coming to the 15th century

[02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:17.140]
The Florida Senate has passed a bill to outlaw sex with animals

[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:18.940]
Get out

[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:20.600]

[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:27.140]
Don't be sheepish about it never have having sex with animals could soon be outlawed in Florida

[02:03:27.140 --> 02:03:32.800]
The Senate unanimously passed a bill today that would make it a third degree felony for anyone to have sex with an animal

[02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:36.020]
A similar bill in the house hasn't been debated on the floor

[02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:40.280]
Florida is one of 16 states without any law banning bestiality

[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:45.880]
The bill sponsored by Senator Nan rich democrat or western would make the offense a third degree felony

[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:50.260]
Punishable up to five years in prison the Florida law would not apply to veterinary practices

[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:52.760]
Well, what does that mean

[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:59.500]
So in other words the vet can have sex with your dog or I don't get that that's right as long as there's no passion involved

[02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:02.700]
No, well, that's what the preset on 60 minutes remember that

[02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:07.880]
Said it wasn't a sin as long as there's no passion involved and that was about molesting girls no less wow

[02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:10.960]
According to the national humane society

[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:16.240]
Several studies highlighted a link between sexual assault of animals and sex crimes against humans

[02:04:21.900 --> 02:04:26.560]
Here pooch just sick really really sick

[02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:30.420]
Can a brother get a break Florida license plate

[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:38.740]
Finding a Republican move to approve religiously oriented specialty licensed tags and bitter about for post-salary cuts for state workers

[02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:42.920]
Senate democratic leader Al Lawson has especially tag idea of his own

[02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:51.080]
Worried about the separation of church and state democratic critics are also incensed about the proposed tag that would feature an image of Christ on the cross

[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:56.980]
Lawson's amendment to SB 3rd 2326 is called can a brother get a break license plate

[02:04:58.040 --> 02:05:02.380]
The plate must primarily display an image of state senator Alfred Al Lawson Jr

[02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:06.640]
The phrase can a brother get a break shall appear in bull letters at the bottom of the plate

[02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:14.200]
Proceeds from the plate would go to employees relief fund for the purpose of offsetting salary and benefit cuts by the legislature and providing grief counseling

[02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:17.880]
You may not mention that Lawson is running for Congress next year

[02:05:18.340 --> 02:05:20.300]
Can a brother get a break license plate

[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:23.540]
It's cute. Yeah, I won't mind

[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:28.840]
You want yours. I think you're gonna get yours. Mm-hmm. Now now what's gonna happen?

[02:05:29.300 --> 02:05:35.000]
I don't want to conjecture because I'm assuming that maybe I'll be able to continue bailing your ass out. I do my best. Uh-huh

[02:05:35.860 --> 02:05:37.260]
Don't I yes you do

[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:38.720]
But

[02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:42.720]
What happens if they find some loophole some I mean that's what they're looking for

[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:45.140]
I think that's what he made clear it just meaning that's what got me so upset

[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:48.160]
In other words what I what I want doesn't count

[02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:49.560]
No matter what it is right

[02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:53.420]
I have nothing to say about this show anymore nothing so what's in

[02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:57.120]
Which proves to me that they want me to take a walk and it's not gonna happen

[02:06:00.380 --> 02:06:03.920]
If I should win a lot or something for like 15 million or something like that

[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:08.400]
Not only will I take a walk but I'll come in on here one day and do a show the likes of which they have never

[02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:11.040]
They'll have to they'll have to bust the transmitter. Mm-hmm

[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:16.060]
What would you do if you thought about it? Yeah

[02:06:18.020 --> 02:06:25.380]
Yeah, try to get a job on a radio station is plan a and if not the repo business is booming right now everybody getting

[02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:28.180]
Yeah, you got a good experience. Yeah

[02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:31.960]
Maybe you could repo Joe Bell

[02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:35.760]
I

[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:39.500]
Sure he's doing but like I said I want I want to say this maybe I'll say it every day or

[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:44.680]
After what he did to Ken Walden nobody is safe just keep that in mind right

[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:50.580]
I mean it was the Humper in 80k and I mean just a long long laundry list

[02:06:50.980 --> 02:06:53.800]
Of people that have gotten really screwed in tattooed

[02:06:54.900 --> 02:06:58.720]
And I don't think any of them in a very ceremonious way you know what I'm saying mm-hmm

[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:06.580]
Because it would take a bench to do it in a ceremonious way and if there's one thing Joe Bell is not there many things

[02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:09.580]
He is if there's one thing he's not it's a bench

[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:10.960]
Nothing

[02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:27.840]
Right now on intergame is tonight the first lady Michelle Obama is generating the little bit of controversy

[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:34.920]
She touched Queen Elizabeth on her nipple and it's not so hard but the Queen's former press secretary says it's okay

[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:41.600]
They have ruled together that special relationship that we've always had also President Obama reportedly gave a sausage to her majesty

[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:44.540]
It's not perfect, but it is the right size

[02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:45.480]
enormous

[02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:48.560]
Plainly x-rated

[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:55.480]
Well, I got some bad news about my fax machine least one of them. Thank God I got two

[02:07:55.480 --> 02:08:02.940]
Yeah, but the one I don't use all that much the one that you faxed me stuff on mm-hmm and the one that you sent me to log and like

[02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:08.140]
Things I changed the a toner cartridge thinking that maybe that would eliminate those dark black line

[02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:11.740]
And I just sent a copy of something through there. Yeah, worse than ever

[02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:16.400]
Somebody remember it was happening over here and somebody told us that there's something dirty in there

[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:18.740]
Just needs to be cleaned and we did it and it worked

[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:23.920]
Something dirty and where in the copier somewhere not a copier guy

[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:28.020]
Maybe I think I need a new um

[02:08:29.540 --> 02:08:34.400]
Drum okay, now if I were smart I'd take the drum out of the other one

[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:37.780]
Stick it in that machine and run something through there. What do you think?

[02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:41.080]
Because the other ones working fine sounds like a plan

[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:43.020]
Maybe I should do it now

[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:47.040]
Now do it during the break. We more saying to do it now

[02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:53.500]
Larry says you're right, Neil people do everything on the slot machines about the only bodily fluid

[02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:56.600]
I haven't seen yet is pee, but I'm sure it's on their hands

[02:08:57.380 --> 02:09:01.340]
I use my knuckle to hit the buttons there. There's some people that bring a glove

[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:08.480]
There's one strange young guy that way he was a black leather glove and a black leather jacket

[02:09:09.140 --> 02:09:11.880]
And he plays one credit at a time on the um

[02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:17.080]
Quick hit machines. Yeah, I'm a two-cent machines. He plays one credit at a time

[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:22.700]
Well, what's the point? I don't know to kill time to kill time. I guess

[02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:28.760]
It said Larry says plus Joe Bell is Jewish to his father changed the name from Bela Witts to Bell

[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:31.580]
So his son was able to get a job. Yeah, you should live so long Larry

[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:34.340]
boy

[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:36.600]
Jew killer

[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:42.600]
But at any rate we don't want to dwell on Joe Bell

[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:48.900]
Do we whatever I mean? I could do the whole show on him every day, but what's the point? Mm-hmm. Oh heath

[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:53.480]
It seems clear that you know George has gone and you're trying to show him that you're attempted to protect

[02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:57.080]
Neil you help him as much as a mother bird could protect his young

[02:09:57.660 --> 02:10:03.440]
But that bird needs to leave the nest and probably won't make it. Sorry, Neil says heath. Yeah, heath is probably Joe Bell

[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:07.920]
Do you think makes sense? I

[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:09.160]
Don't think George is going anywhere

[02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:11.380]
604 votes on that poll

[02:10:12.180 --> 02:10:17.860]
About bad breath and mong and nose picking and ass scratching and ball looking. I mean the scratching

[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:21.040]
Now

[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:24.980]
Now blackie says I just got this email from the desk at work. I work for a hospital

[02:10:24.980 --> 02:10:29.800]
Maybe this will help with a mass panic if there's one thing we don't want to do. It's create a mass panic

[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:33.680]
Although the rest of the media doing a hell of a job on that

[02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:40.560]
Thank the Lord that Arlen spectrum decided to switch parties at least now that's all they're talking about as opposed to

[02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:42.860]
That

[02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:47.500]
You know no matter how much they get

[02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:54.160]
Whipped up about something there's always something else that comes along right and knocks it off their front page

[02:10:55.660 --> 02:10:56.100]
ah

[02:10:57.900 --> 02:11:01.220]
Anyway, so blackie sent me this info. It's from Arthur E. Brown

[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:05.580]
Chief and director employee health and wellness services at this hospital

[02:11:06.780 --> 02:11:11.640]
It says no doubt you're aware the cases of swine flu have been identified in New York City and outbreak is occurring in Mexico

[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:13.900]
Unlike the illness being reported from Mexico

[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:19.480]
The cases in the US today have been quite mild and New York City has not seen any increase in the air visits

[02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:21.480]
for respiratory illnesses

[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:22.680]
Nonetheless

[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:23.820]
Hi ever

[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:31.840]
We want to make every effort to inform and protect our employees and our patients the infection control team is monitoring the situation carefully and will keep us up to date

[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:37.820]
We've had some inquiries from staff regarding the situations. They are the basic guidelines. You should follow

[02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:43.260]
When in question or in doubt run in circle screaming shout no here it is

[02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:46.780]
One if you have symptoms of respiratory illness fever

[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:47.960]
chills

[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:52.900]
sore throat cough severe fatigue muscle aches etc. Do not report to work

[02:11:53.980 --> 02:12:00.280]
Notify your supervisor and employee health and wellness and contact your personal physician or visit your local emergency room

[02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:05.080]
Following your recovery you must come to EH and WS to be clear to return to work

[02:12:07.340 --> 02:12:07.820]
to

[02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:13.200]
If you're already a work and begin to experience systems of a respiratory illness or as they say here respiratory

[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:16.460]
Please have your supervisor call

[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:22.520]
EH and WS employee health and wellness services and their professionals will just help you determine what next step should be

[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:23.460]
three

[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:29.320]
The most effective way to lower the risk of influenza transmission is for individuals with symptoms to stay home

[02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:33.460]
Everyone to cover their mouths with disposable facial tissues when they cough

[02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:39.660]
Additional precautions should include washing your hands off in with soap and water especially after you cough or sneeze

[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:43.800]
See there for

[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:48.760]
That when I was a stage cough. Oh not really was half and a half

[02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:55.020]
For employees who do not have respiratory illness symptoms and are otherwise able to report to work are expected to do so

[02:12:56.120 --> 02:13:03.260]
As this is an evolving story updates will be posted on the internet and on the EH and WS website. This is our already brown

[02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:07.700]
That can be down a little bit okay

[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:11.820]
I mean there's nobody died from it in the USA yet

[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:19.760]
Good and the fact that they're dying in Mexico probably by some can be only viewed as well. I'm gonna say

[02:13:20.940 --> 02:13:21.780]
A normal day

[02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:22.720]
No

[02:13:23.620 --> 02:13:25.280]
I'm not I'm not gonna say it okay

[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:29.760]
You're gonna try to see they're still hucking a china about our inspector

[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:35.420]
What do they do on MSNBC if they're if they're still in our inspector in MSNBC. Let's see

[02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:41.680]
Things like a chairmanship or a subcommittee chairmanship from the Democrat there. You

[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:42.860]
As you're when I first

[02:13:43.340 --> 02:13:47.620]
President Obama co-specter the Democrats are thrilled to have you she get that you

[02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:52.080]
Immediately call and isn't that what you'll be upset about you. We're thrilled to have George. Yeah

[02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:54.920]
It's

[02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:59.920]
It's really interesting because in the past he's always had you know wonderful things to say about you on the air and about

[02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:04.120]
What available employee you are and not nothing they've just said they want to blow you out

[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:10.860]
Oh, he doesn't like you on the air and there other people can do a better job and yada yada meaning of course flee your good post personal friend right

[02:14:13.220 --> 02:14:19.540]
So I think this is all part of a greater plan to either get me to walk out. I think that's what it's all about

[02:14:19.540 --> 02:14:23.840]
To give me to walk out. I won't walk out under any circumstances

[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.420]
I'm not going to cut off my ass to spite my legs

[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:30.240]
Good plan

[02:14:31.060 --> 02:14:33.940]
But then that's what he wants and you keep denying that

[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:39.380]
Well, stop how's that because because you know how much money I'm making which is still even though half of what it used to be

[02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:42.740]
Still a pretty good penny. Yeah, they could bring somebody in for like

[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:49.280]
10% of that sure and get and get the same numbers they get you know like certain day parts like oh like that

[02:14:49.540 --> 02:14:51.500]
Or ones I think that's what they want

[02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:58.860]
Maybe said the kid and I guess Joe's been launching with Sid Rosenberg. He's a good backstabber

[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:01.080]
From when I hear

[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:06.440]
Maybe they're cooking something up. You know, maybe they got a big cauldron up there in Joe's office

[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:10.020]
Like they like the witch in LA. What was the what was the which one was it with the witch?

[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:10.640]
Miss Cinderella

[02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:13.700]
Okay, am I right? Yeah

[02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:18.400]
The witch with a big cauldron cooking up that special abru sleeping

[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:20.520]
Get ready to screw you

[02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:28.060]
The audience won't sit still for it though. Yeah, the tremendous outpouring. We've had today not

[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:32.100]
They're they're more worried about our inspector

[02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:35.520]
And the sly and honed flew

[02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:46.220]
Boy here here's a nice long one don't let me forget during the break to try that thing with the um

[02:15:47.140 --> 02:15:48.460]
The drum from the other one

[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:51.300]
Because if this one goes out

[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:57.380]
What you need is a drum for your facts. You know, I believe that

[02:15:58.020 --> 02:16:02.480]
Oh, Jose the copier guy he should know and needs a new drum right usually there's a warning on it

[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:10.000]
It says replace drum, you know, and you don't want to do that because because the toner cartridges aren't all expensive the drum. Oh my god

[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:14.180]
Maybe our ordered ten drums to have them just in case there you go

[02:16:16.580 --> 02:16:18.460]
And charge it all to QAM

[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:26.500]
Have any idea how many thousands of dollars I spent out of my own well-heeled pocket. Yeah, seven and a half years

[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:28.980]
Sure never charge them a dime

[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:33.600]
And what do I get? Oh, we want a fire George. We hate you Neil

[02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:36.240]
We love your show, but we hate you

[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:39.840]
Well, I like that one while deep

[02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:46.120]
Paul Rodriguez says I assume the Vedic exception for sex with animals is in the case of artificial

[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:48.000]
Yeah, that's it

[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:51.640]
That's cute

[02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:55.480]
The debate has been going on until I have to for a few weeks

[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:59.680]
I remember hearing about this debate for a couple of articles I read about the lovely state senator

[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:02.180]
larcenia board from Miami

[02:17:03.700 --> 02:17:07.740]
It says check this out and stay very far away from here Neil. Oh boy

[02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:16.000]
Via Jonathan Turley on counter the elsewhere freakish but Florida Mondays to have state senator

[02:17:16.220 --> 02:17:17.200]
Larci and a board

[02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:18.620]
Democratic Miami

[02:17:18.620 --> 02:17:22.700]
Polar became agitated during a Florida legislative debate over a bcl d law

[02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:29.060]
I'm not entirely sure based on my familiarity with Florida that this is a bad thing

[02:17:29.060 --> 02:17:33.620]
I'm not sure that they should be excluding some of the smarter animals for their potential gene pool

[02:17:34.220 --> 02:17:38.420]
Anyway, Polar became agitated when someone used the term animal husbandry

[02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:44.500]
Riches legislation would target only those who derived or helped others derive sexual gratification from an animal

[02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:49.420]
Specifying the conventional dog judging contests and animal husbandry practices are permissible

[02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:56.220]
The last provision tripped up Miami Democratic Senator larcenia board people are taking these animals as their husbands

[02:17:56.220 --> 02:17:57.860]
What's husbandry she asked?

[02:17:58.600 --> 02:17:59.600]
Some senators

[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:07.600]
Some senators stifled their laughter as senator Charlie Dean and Inverness Republic and explain that husbandry is raising and caring for animals

[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:08.820]
Board didn't get it

[02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:14.080]
So maybe that was the reason the lady was so upset about that monkey bullard ass referring to a kinetic case

[02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:16.720]
Where the woman's suburban chimpanzee went mad

[02:18:19.340 --> 02:18:23.200]
Yes, the federal government has grown increasingly long-crusted

[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:27.520]
But bear in mind that most of the laws that govern your everyday life determine how your children are educated

[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:32.120]
Limit how you run your business are debated and passed by the state and local politicians like larcenia board

[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.980]
So ask yourself do the anarchists still seem so silly?

[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:39.300]
How do you like that?

[02:18:39.580 --> 02:18:44.060]
Well, and a commentator at the agitated points out that board is the vice chair of the agriculture

[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:45.440]
Committee in a former teacher

[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:48.640]
making her ignorance even more awesome

[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:51.820]
A rat animal husbandry

[02:18:57.140 --> 02:18:58.360]
Isn't that right down the road?

[02:18:58.780 --> 02:19:04.480]
Miriam pet sure you got gay marriage coming. That's what the right wingers are gonna tell you next thing you'll be able to marry your orangutan

[02:19:07.260 --> 02:19:09.800]
The dows of seven points by the way. It's not doing much

[02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:15.340]
Breaking news specter made decision after the poll showed him trailing in a primary boy

[02:19:15.340 --> 02:19:19.640]
What a political opportunist, huh? He's afraid he's gonna get his ass whipped so he changes it. Yeah

[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:25.260]
Fighting against to me with to me having all the odds exactly. I mean five years ago

[02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:30.380]
He beat to me by a whisker former congressman to me and so you know like everyone else

[02:19:30.380 --> 02:19:37.020]
He saw more than 200,000 people leave the party within the course of the last year plus who are those?

[02:19:37.020 --> 02:19:41.580]
It's called abandoning a sinking ship. It's like people jumping off the Titanic

[02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:48.380]
Racing away from the Republican party like a sick dying animal in the desert

[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:51.680]
They some stands for nothing

[02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:57.980]
This is I with this new jittle ask your governor Sarah Palin know her daughter Bristol was having sex

[02:19:57.980 --> 02:20:06.600]

enormous for oh I already played that but you can't have too much sex with Levi Johnston

[02:20:17.220 --> 02:20:22.960]
You're in teen so I swapped out and Jose was right and I was right it was the drum man. Oh got a bad drum

[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:27.480]
That's the expensive part. Yeah, look at all the money you saved them

[02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:35.400]
Now I didn't I already do this thing from Kenny grammar is a saying you got listen to the show Kenny about the supreme court and

Been there and done that but you know what I'll print it out read it again. Maybe some people missed it

[02:20:49.020 --> 02:20:50.840]
The world is and we've got

[02:20:52.020 --> 02:20:55.460]
Butchery going on all over the world people are dying from a swine flu

[02:20:55.460 --> 02:21:03.280]
The economy is where in a worldwide depression and the the government is worried about the words that we say on a radio and TV

[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:08.460]
These are the times that try men's holes a souls

[02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:12.440]
Aren't they oh yeah

[02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:18.780]

[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:55.620]
Not hysterical not fall down on your face and go nuts laughing but but amusing

[02:21:57.540 --> 02:22:03.160]
It was bad enough when gale bucner took her husband's marked Polk County Sheriff's Office patrol car without permission

[02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:06.580]
And went on a Sunday morning jury ride to Lakeland investigators say

[02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:14.820]
It got even worse when investigators discovered that bucner was a convicted felon and three different types of firearms were inside the patrol car during the jury ride

[02:22:16.020 --> 02:22:21.480]
To tap it all off the teenager writing in the back seat who founded exciting as the lights flashed in the siren

[02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:26.700]
Wail was out on bail on an armed robbery charge or going to rest reports all right

[02:22:29.380 --> 02:22:37.960]
Buckner 38 of Lakeland and Alexander James quintascat 19 or rested someday as was the second passenger Sheryl and Cooper 54

[02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:47.540]
Buckner's husband deputy Charles chip Buckner the turd resigned today Sheriff's Office spokesman Kerry Elise said what they was this and this is it today

[02:22:49.220 --> 02:22:53.440]
Investigators in the rest reports give this account of what happened 11 30 Sunday morning a

[02:22:54.560 --> 02:23:01.860]
Witness saw Charles Buckner's patrol car leaving a gas station moving erratically down the road with a the lights and the siren on

[02:23:02.580 --> 02:23:05.760]
As the patrol car drove drove toward cruise lake road

[02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:12.000]
In rana red light other vehicles yielded to its flashing light and wailing siren the patrol car was going over 80 miles an hour

[02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:16.720]
The witness followed the car into a subdivision and to the buckner's house

[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:17.580]
Uh

[02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:26.960]
Sheriff sergeant called Charles Buckner who told the sergeant his wife had taken in his sheriff's office issued car without his permission while he was sleeping

[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:28.820]
He was sleeping

[02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:36.020]
During the jury ride gale Buckner Cooper and quintascat and access to three weapons of sheriff's office glad pistol and

[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:41.060]
Something gained shotgun and Charles Buckner's personal 380 water a Walter PPK pistol

[02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:46.500]
Kale Buckner told investigators she made a bad judgment call meant no harm

[02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:52.200]
Cooper says he's suffering from a terminal illness and that's why Buckner took her for a spin in the deputy's cruiser

[02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:56.580]
Maybe she wanted to do it. Hey to speed up the process you think

[02:23:57.820 --> 02:23:59.540]
Oh, no, don't start again

[02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:02.740]
Now with 39 minutes to go

[02:24:04.100 --> 02:24:09.720]
Quintascat told investigators he knew he shouldn't have been riding in the car but assume Buckner had permission to take it because she had the keys

[02:24:11.180 --> 02:24:12.160]
Hubby was asleep

[02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:18.760]
Quintascat out on bail on an armed robbery charge initially gave deputies a false name

[02:24:19.300 --> 02:24:22.580]
He told deputies that if he went back to jail his boundary would be revoked

[02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:26.620]
The teen also told deputies he enjoyed riding in the patrol car and found it exciting

[02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:30.840]
The downs up six points not too exciting

[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:35.140]
Oh, this is kicking in again. Oh, no

[02:24:36.060 --> 02:24:39.520]
Remember yesterday right about this time in the last five minutes. Oh, no, we're gonna die

[02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:41.480]
Not good

[02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:47.120]
Maybe too many of these halls met the liptus

[02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:52.340]
I think too much of this crap can scurry up

[02:24:54.820 --> 02:24:58.220]
Anyway, Quintascat was charged with grand theft and personating a law enforcement officer

[02:24:58.220 --> 02:25:03.120]
Grand theft of a firearm possession of a firearm by convicted felon and resisting arrest without violence

[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:08.700]
He's being held without bail at Polk County jail. Oh Polk's out of the dandy would be so proud Polk County

[02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:15.140]
Ever been Polk County, Lakeland not lately. Oh, what a Yahoo place. I thought you were gonna say just this morning. Well, I was fast trip

[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:19.980]
What a real Yahoo place you talk about trailer trash. Oh

[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:25.260]
Oh my god, I'm getting choked up just thinking about it

[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:31.840]
And it goes on a little bit. I don't think we need to know what they were charged with etc and so on do we? No

[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:37.300]
I'm telling you this thing is coming back again for his last half hour here. I think three hours would have been fine

[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:40.880]
Uh-huh

[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:44.100]
See see what I mean. Mm-hmm. I didn't have any tea today though

[02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:46.520]
But you know what I am gonna have

[02:25:48.220 --> 02:25:48.880]
What bacon

[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:54.700]
I didn't make it this morning because we were too busy and I was talking about you getting fired. Yeah

[02:25:56.940 --> 02:26:02.680]
So I didn't make no bacon, but I think I shouldn't have some before I go to wood mine as opposed to those candy bars probably

[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:03.500]
If

[02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:11.460]
If there's one thing that will really screw up your throat big time chocolate. Oh, oh, yeah, Fleming am I right? Yes

[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:19.000]
Rick and Bokas says if you were Georgia trying to figure out why management may want your job forget it

[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:23.720]
You're thinking too logically and forget that all the recent decisions made are totally logical

[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:26.540]
Here we go again

[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:34.860]
Damn it you'll be more successful in predicting on what will happen with George by looking at the poor decisions made in the past and applying their logic to the president future

[02:26:35.660 --> 02:26:37.620]
That don't sound too promising. No

[02:26:37.620 --> 02:26:43.340]
I think I better get one of them strep oscillals

[02:26:43.980 --> 02:26:46.660]
Good idea. I think I'll do any good. I'm gonna go get one

[02:26:58.700 --> 02:26:58.940]
Oh

[02:27:08.220 --> 02:27:14.940]
He lives on queer street lingers rounds on queer street

[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:22.640]
He has a house and garden. I would love to see what happens

[02:27:29.460 --> 02:27:29.500]
Hey

Hitches holes and pets is funky women clothes they can look real funky

[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:43.980]
He has a whiz whiz and knows what to do

[02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:49.580]

[02:28:05.450 --> 02:28:07.810]

[02:28:53.930 --> 02:28:57.910]
Hot tea. No, I don't have no hot tea. Should I go make some hot tea?

[02:28:59.350 --> 02:29:04.470]
Yeah, I think you should I don't think that helps. I think that I think that actually led to my demise yesterday hot tea

[02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:10.670]
Well, I don't I think that's just um, it's not a peddling point to sell more tea. No

[02:29:11.170 --> 02:29:16.190]
You don't hot liquids the non flimmy kind like you don't want to drink hot milk

[02:29:16.910 --> 02:29:19.370]
Well milk I don't drink no milk right crazy

Uh, not as good as not as hot tea

[02:29:30.090 --> 02:29:34.350]
My Johnson is back. He says joebells reach as far and wide

[02:29:35.730 --> 02:29:40.270]
Seems like it's not only joebell blowing people out of beastly radio station in Florida

[02:29:40.270 --> 02:29:45.230]
Across the coast in southwest Florida. They fired several other experience on air personnel

[02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:51.770]
These weekend, etc in favor of inexperienced 21 to 25-year-old fluzies who wouldn't know Sydney, Crosby from Bing Crosby

[02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:53.810]
Uh, that's cute

[02:29:54.690 --> 02:29:57.810]
On top of that even though they fired them and not for work related issues

[02:29:57.810 --> 02:30:02.650]
They're trying to block them from working at their competitors sports stations by invoking the non-compete clauses

[02:30:03.610 --> 02:30:08.350]
Uh, joebell must have taught these people well before leaving here and coming over to these coast and ruining it there

[02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:14.190]
And then they he goes on with his radio listening habits. All right. Well, thanks Mike

[02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:15.890]
Oh, thanks for the first part

[02:30:17.410 --> 02:30:23.310]
Are you fixing me something? Yes, yes, it's not gonna come through. No, I mean it'll come through with a bunch of black lines

[02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:28.670]
Oh, no, I thought you could be able to read it. Oh damn it

[02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:30.830]
Well save it for tomorrow

[02:30:32.970 --> 02:30:36.650]
Well, what I can do is I can stick the other thing in there the other drum

[02:30:38.130 --> 02:30:40.810]
Uh, and then you can re-refax them right. It's not pressing

[02:30:41.390 --> 02:30:46.350]
What it's not pressing. It's just another right please story. It's a great pre-story

[02:30:47.310 --> 02:30:48.130]
Where's it from

[02:30:53.310 --> 02:30:59.690]
Arkansas, ooh, okay, I'll tell you what I'm gonna uh play a little tune or do something just just second

Go ahead go ahead

[02:31:31.410 --> 02:31:37.450]
And now let's see this should come out pristine and clean with the other drum in there

[02:31:41.430 --> 02:31:46.610]
Of course once upon a time I used to keep a spirit drum along with several spirit toner cartridges which I have

[02:31:47.030 --> 02:31:47.930]
But not the drum

[02:31:49.030 --> 02:31:54.190]
They're expensive man. They're gonna cause joebell or fortune when I order like 20 of them. Wow

[02:31:55.330 --> 02:31:58.410]
Well, you can ever have too many spares. Are you refaxing or not? Yes

[02:31:59.490 --> 02:32:00.770]
Wow, this is exciting

[02:32:02.470 --> 02:32:07.230]
Well, what's really gonna be exciting is if I can read it you think maybe

[02:32:11.610 --> 02:32:13.910]
Now I'm not gonna be able to get another drum until tomorrow

[02:32:15.030 --> 02:32:17.690]
So tomorrow morning remind me early okay

[02:32:18.270 --> 02:32:21.670]
Before you fax the log to inner to swap these out all right

[02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:27.350]
I know because I need to keep it in the other machine because that's when I print out all these nifty um stories and emails and crap on

[02:32:27.930 --> 02:32:33.330]
Which is the show okay? Oh, why don't you take some calls in you you can barely speak take some calls. No

[02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.390]
No

[02:32:36.050 --> 02:32:38.730]
Maybe if I croaked I would take some calls

[02:32:40.290 --> 02:32:41.950]
Did you are you sure oh here comes

[02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:44.810]
Here it comes

[02:32:46.890 --> 02:32:53.150]
And it's two pages to since it's gonna be a real challenge. I think I got over it. It was just like a lump of flame. I guess I started it again

[02:32:53.150 --> 02:32:56.810]
Well, I'll take some of it to get this crap out of your system and like I said it's only been a week

[02:32:57.390 --> 02:32:59.770]
Sometime this crap lasts for like two weeks or more wow

[02:33:00.430 --> 02:33:01.150]
right yep

[02:33:02.490 --> 02:33:06.090]
And like you said it waxed these in wanes and well here's a nice clean copy

[02:33:06.090 --> 02:33:10.370]
I got a clean machine man from the Arkansas Democrat Gazette

[02:33:11.310 --> 02:33:15.210]
Three more claim abuse by former minister you said priest oh

[02:33:15.730 --> 02:33:19.930]
Whatever back this minister mister you better get your minister straight. They're all priests

[02:33:20.770 --> 02:33:23.050]
They're all gay. Oh

[02:33:23.730 --> 02:33:24.670]
Are they really?

[02:33:25.550 --> 02:33:28.870]
In one respect or another whatever title they like best

[02:33:29.810 --> 02:33:32.370]
Well, what do we buy that? Baptists have priests

[02:33:33.050 --> 02:33:37.550]
That's the official title but they put the priest is the word for any clergyman is a priest

[02:33:38.470 --> 02:33:39.590]
Even a rabbi

[02:33:42.350 --> 02:33:47.170]
Benton Arkansas at least three men have come forward saying they were sexually abused as teenagers by a long time

[02:33:47.170 --> 02:33:51.870]
Baptist minister who was arrested last week after a teenager reported a 2006 instance

[02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:59.810]
David Kent Pierce former music minister at Benton's first Baptist Church was arrested on a felony count of sexual indecency with a child

[02:33:59.810 --> 02:34:01.230]
According to an arrest report

[02:34:02.370 --> 02:34:06.610]
When church leaders became aware possible abuse they contacted authorities and provided

[02:34:06.610 --> 02:34:10.890]
Investigators of the names of three adult church members who also said they were abused by Pierce when they were younger

[02:34:12.110 --> 02:34:20.750]
Pierce 56 of Benton showed teenage boys pornography on a church computer engaged in sexually explicit conversations and took detailed measurements of their bodies

[02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:23.490]
According to an allegate it sounds like the NFL combine

[02:34:24.490 --> 02:34:26.750]
Wonder if the thing always there rock solid

[02:34:26.750 --> 02:34:26.970]
Ah

[02:34:28.750 --> 02:34:36.270]
The indecency charge stems from a 17 year old boys claim that Pierce took him to a lake cabin when the boy was 15 and made him measure his own genitals

[02:34:36.270 --> 02:34:39.470]
While Pierce watched and took notes which he called charting

[02:34:40.670 --> 02:34:42.170]
Be arrest report says

[02:34:42.730 --> 02:34:46.750]
Inecency with a child as a class D felony punishable by up to six years in the slamer

[02:34:47.410 --> 02:34:50.790]
Pierce could face additional charges as the investigation continues

[02:34:51.510 --> 02:34:56.630]
Said lieutenant Mike Frost were still interviewing victims frost noting that some allegations date back a number of years

[02:34:57.930 --> 02:35:03.290]
The arrest report makes no allegation that Pierce touched the boys genitals and the sheriff's office would not discuss specifics

[02:35:03.290 --> 02:35:04.610]
Same the cases ongoing

[02:35:04.610 --> 02:35:06.130]
Pierce's denied any touching

[02:35:07.150 --> 02:35:10.190]
While I fully acknowledge the sinfulness and immorality my past behavior

[02:35:10.190 --> 02:35:16.410]
I did not engage in actual sexual contact specifically oral sex intercourse or masturbating another individual with any person

[02:35:16.950 --> 02:35:21.550]
Person on the letter to church leaders letter was quoted in court. He just want to see if the kids measured out by guess

[02:35:22.190 --> 02:35:24.330]
I don't like the NFL combine

[02:35:24.910 --> 02:35:25.310]
Oh

[02:35:26.330 --> 02:35:28.570]
There's the Toronto make believe they sure don't measure up

[02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:35.490]
Man, I think it's the Marlies you like the Marlies

[02:35:36.370 --> 02:35:44.110]
The who's the Marlies? That's the a minor league team. Oh the least minor league team the Toronto Marlies or you like the Marlins better the Marlins

[02:35:44.110 --> 02:35:46.590]
Marlins have lost I don't know seven in a row now

[02:35:49.050 --> 02:35:52.790]
They keep up like this man. They're gonna be nobody left to come to those games

[02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:55.150]
I get that spiffy new stadium that lasts for about two weeks

[02:35:58.290 --> 02:36:01.670]
Pierce also wrote he didn't think his actions have violated criminal or civil law

[02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:05.650]
Pierce was fired from the church April 18 after emitting the serious moral failures

[02:36:06.970 --> 02:36:12.470]
Past a Rick Grant told church members the next Sunday. I'm heart sick overall this grand said during my 20 plus years

[02:36:12.470 --> 02:36:15.590]
The ministry here. This is the most difficult thing. I've had to deal with by far

[02:36:17.350 --> 02:36:21.750]
It wasn't immediately clear who's representing Pierce though deputy prosecutor Rebecca Bush

[02:36:22.310 --> 02:36:24.450]
Said during a hearing Monday that I fill it up

[02:36:25.270 --> 02:36:28.070]
Ark of Delphi in attorney. What what does Ark of Delphi?

[02:36:28.930 --> 02:36:30.330]
I don't hear that. No

[02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:33.610]
Ark of Delphi attorney had been retained the attorney was not present

[02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:38.530]
Pierce wearing a striped-out uniform said little as he appeared on the TV screen

[02:36:38.530 --> 02:36:44.470]
Industrial Judge Mike Robinson's courtroom bail hearings in saline county are conducted remotely within major meeting of jail

[02:36:45.230 --> 02:36:49.190]
Robinson said bail a 25 grand ordered pierced to have no contact with his accuser

[02:36:50.650 --> 02:36:51.050]
Ah

[02:36:51.050 --> 02:36:53.510]
Sexual or otherwise I

[02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:58.990]
Think I made a pretty good comeback there during maybe it was that strep episode you think must have been I think all that stuff is crap

[02:37:00.310 --> 02:37:01.790]
It's all like glorified candy

[02:37:03.030 --> 02:37:08.230]
Okay, although that Rexall stuff I had yesterday see if I would have been smart. I would have gotten bought more I didn't

[02:37:09.230 --> 02:37:11.550]
Now that was working pretty good till those last five minutes

[02:37:11.550 --> 02:37:16.210]
Oh, there's an Arlen inspector

[02:37:19.190 --> 02:37:24.930]
Just announced he was gonna be a Democrat. So this is exciting news here in Philadelphia and of course

[02:37:25.750 --> 02:37:27.790]
Pennsylvania, but I think also for the country

[02:37:28.390 --> 02:37:34.730]
Given his significant vote with regard to the recovery act and making sure that that was of course

[02:37:34.730 --> 02:37:39.330]
Who the Republicans got waiting in the wings? You know who they're talking about now nudie gingrich. Oh my god

[02:37:39.330 --> 02:37:40.150]
That's what they got

[02:37:44.290 --> 02:37:46.250]
For the flagship station

[02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:51.350]

And I know come to give them back

[02:38:29.190 --> 02:38:31.330]
But you know that we're nice

[02:38:33.310 --> 02:38:35.910]
Cause we're A-I-G

[02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:39.850]
We don't give a crap for A-I-G

[02:38:39.850 --> 02:38:41.850]
And we won't give it back

[02:38:41.850 --> 02:38:43.730]
A-I-G

[02:38:43.730 --> 02:38:47.190]
A-I-G

[02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:54.270]
G-G-G-G-A-I-G

[02:38:55.330 --> 02:38:57.390]
Oh yeah, another one with a dead ending like that

[02:38:57.390 --> 02:38:58.870]
And I just got back from gargling

[02:38:58.870 --> 02:39:00.610]
And how is it?

[02:39:00.750 --> 02:39:02.350]
Brandon said, gargle with something

[02:39:03.630 --> 02:39:05.130]
And he'll clear your throat right up

[02:39:05.130 --> 02:39:06.030]
And don't I sound much better?

[02:39:06.250 --> 02:39:06.590]
Yes you do

[02:39:06.590 --> 02:39:08.350]
What a freaking genius that Brandon

[02:39:08.950 --> 02:39:11.290]
Let's make him the General Manager and fire Joe Bell

[02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:13.790]
Let's take a vote

[02:39:13.790 --> 02:39:15.590]
The cows have 21 points

[02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:17.290]
Aren't you excited?

[02:39:17.530 --> 02:39:18.950]

What's her name?

[02:39:24.090 --> 02:39:24.450]
I forget

[02:39:26.690 --> 02:39:28.290]

[02:39:29.150 --> 02:39:29.370]

[02:39:32.190 --> 02:39:35.070]
I don't know who that is

[02:39:35.070 --> 02:39:37.530]
The NBC reporter blonde old

Barbara Walters

[02:39:43.090 --> 02:39:43.970]
Gloria

[02:39:43.970 --> 02:39:46.450]
Loud cell calls was a late addition to the poll

[02:39:46.450 --> 02:39:47.370]
So Steve and Jersey

[02:39:48.010 --> 02:39:50.610]
It has now passed every item but bad breath

[02:39:51.490 --> 02:39:53.970]
Indicating what annoying and anti-social activity it is

[02:39:53.970 --> 02:39:56.870]
I heard there's a gadget out to cut off surrounding cell calls

[02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:58.870]
Up to 50 feet and would have anything to have on

[02:39:58.870 --> 02:39:59.890]
So Steve, enjoy

[02:40:00.630 --> 02:40:01.350]
They do that

[02:40:01.350 --> 02:40:02.990]
I haven't even looked at that poll lately of you

[02:40:02.990 --> 02:40:03.810]
No

[02:40:04.490 --> 02:40:05.270]
Maybe we should

[02:40:06.810 --> 02:40:08.110]
Okay, let me print it out

[02:40:08.110 --> 02:40:09.810]
On the good machine mod

[02:40:10.930 --> 02:40:12.330]
Just another annoyance

[02:40:12.330 --> 02:40:12.590]
You know?

[02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:13.390]
Mm-hmm

[02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:15.670]
Surviving this damn Shfinhun flu

[02:40:18.890 --> 02:40:21.710]
Hotel's bathroom voted classiest US flush

[02:40:22.690 --> 02:40:25.130]
Luxury Nashville Hotel is the topcent toilets

[02:40:25.130 --> 02:40:26.110]
Well that's good

[02:40:26.110 --> 02:40:27.650]
I'll save that one for tomorrow

[02:40:28.890 --> 02:40:29.910]
If I'm here tomorrow

[02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:31.490]
You might be here I might not be able to talk

[02:40:31.490 --> 02:40:34.630]
Although I think I'm getting over it

[02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:36.470]
Oh I am

[02:40:36.970 --> 02:40:38.530]
I don't have any more nasal congestion

[02:40:38.530 --> 02:40:39.990]
No more big chunks of snot

[02:40:40.570 --> 02:40:41.490]
I can breathe

[02:40:43.930 --> 02:40:44.850]
I'm not reason

[02:40:47.490 --> 02:40:49.290]
Here's the poll, 644 votes

[02:40:49.290 --> 02:40:50.950]
That's not too bad for now

[02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:53.110]
You know, in the old days we'd have like 1100

[02:40:54.490 --> 02:40:55.590]
When we had an audience

[02:40:56.510 --> 02:40:58.750]
The most annoying habit other people can do in my presence

[02:40:58.750 --> 02:41:01.410]
By the way, speaking of audience Thursday morning attend the book comes out

[02:41:02.130 --> 02:41:04.870]
All you people in the business, all you closet listeners out there

[02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:06.750]
They'll all be gathered around our radios

[02:41:08.150 --> 02:41:10.110]
Like if the airs fireside chats

[02:41:10.110 --> 02:41:11.890]
Everybody used to gather around the radio

[02:41:12.970 --> 02:41:14.330]
That's what they'll be doing on Thursday

[02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:16.510]
The winter book

[02:41:16.510 --> 02:41:18.510]
I think our last chance ever for a bonus

[02:41:21.190 --> 02:41:22.790]
I'll tell you your last chance

[02:41:22.790 --> 02:41:23.110]
Right

[02:41:24.650 --> 02:41:27.190]
The most annoying habit other people can do in my presence is

[02:41:27.190 --> 02:41:29.490]
Emitt Badbreath or BO139

[02:41:30.110 --> 02:41:32.550]

That's our new logo Fart 56

[02:41:43.210 --> 02:41:44.510]
I can hear the jingles now

[02:41:45.210 --> 02:41:47.350]
Wide mic can sing them for us

[02:41:48.210 --> 02:41:50.750]
Spit on the ground 35 spit while talking 30

[02:41:50.750 --> 02:41:52.070]

Humb 13

[02:42:00.490 --> 02:42:02.430]
Now speaking of scratching their balls

[02:42:02.430 --> 02:42:06.230]
What is that Latin thing that Italians and Latinos do

[02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:09.110]
Is a gesture of hostility

[02:42:10.050 --> 02:42:11.470]
Where they grab their balls

[02:42:11.470 --> 02:42:13.490]
Yeah, it looks pretty hostile to me

[02:42:13.490 --> 02:42:14.770]
You know I'm saying?

[02:42:15.090 --> 02:42:16.390]
Yeah, the brothers do it too

[02:42:16.390 --> 02:42:18.170]
The brothers do that too

[02:42:18.170 --> 02:42:18.610]
A lot of people

[02:42:18.610 --> 02:42:20.670]
A lot of people grab their balls

[02:42:21.210 --> 02:42:21.730]
Sure

[02:42:22.430 --> 02:42:23.030]

Bite their nails 7

[02:42:29.890 --> 02:42:31.270]
Did I say crack their knuckle 13

[02:42:31.270 --> 02:42:32.130]
I don't think I can do it

[02:42:32.130 --> 02:42:33.270]
Just a little bit

[02:42:33.270 --> 02:42:34.130]
Not too good

[02:42:34.570 --> 02:42:35.630]
Bought their nails 7

[02:42:35.630 --> 02:42:36.930]
What's wrong with biting their nails

[02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:38.970]
Some people don't like that

[02:42:39.470 --> 02:42:41.270]
Well, too bad I bite my nail

[02:42:41.270 --> 02:42:42.970]
Although I don't bite them in public

[02:42:43.770 --> 02:42:44.850]
Eat sloppy for

[02:42:44.850 --> 02:42:46.610]
Jingle their keys 4

[02:42:49.510 --> 02:42:51.150]
And this one's my Corvette keys

[02:42:51.150 --> 02:42:53.310]
Only got one key on it

[02:42:57.590 --> 02:43:00.550]
Boy is that like some kind of a signal when guys jingle their keys

[02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:02.070]
Yes, that you'd have to tell me

[02:43:02.750 --> 02:43:03.910]
What do you mean I'd have to tell you?

[02:43:03.970 --> 02:43:04.650]
Is it something gay?

[02:43:04.950 --> 02:43:06.270]
Like a toe tapping or something I don't know

[02:43:06.270 --> 02:43:08.210]
Oh toe tapping I don't know nothing about that

[02:43:09.990 --> 02:43:12.810]
I know about tapping other things but not toe tapping

[02:43:15.070 --> 02:43:16.770]
Well, oh I think I'm going to make it

[02:43:16.770 --> 02:43:18.090]
Thanks Brandon for the good advice

[02:43:19.930 --> 02:43:21.970]
He said just for a quick fix

[02:43:21.970 --> 02:43:22.890]
Just go and gargle something

[02:43:22.890 --> 02:43:24.890]
If you have mouthwash gargle it'll help clear through

[02:43:24.890 --> 02:43:25.430]
And it did

[02:43:25.430 --> 02:43:28.230]
I gargle not suggest that earlier and you poop who did

[02:43:28.230 --> 02:43:28.830]
Who did?

[02:43:29.230 --> 02:43:29.810]
Somebody did

[02:43:29.810 --> 02:43:32.150]
You said I gargle my orange list of reen

[02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.750]
Good

[02:43:34.910 --> 02:43:37.790]
The only problem is I damn you're almost swallowed it

[02:43:37.790 --> 02:43:38.550]
Don't do that

[02:43:38.550 --> 02:43:40.950]
That gargling is like it's like a balancing act

[02:43:40.950 --> 02:43:43.030]
You gotta like take a breath first

[02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:47.310]
No, you gotta like balance that stuff on your taste buds

[02:43:47.830 --> 02:43:49.110]
On your throat

[02:43:49.990 --> 02:43:51.890]
And then spit it out

[02:43:52.730 --> 02:43:53.810]
And the list of reen too

[02:43:54.690 --> 02:43:56.770]
Vince says what's the deal with Joe Belgity with it George

[02:43:56.770 --> 02:43:58.730]
What did George do talking trash about Joe?

[02:43:59.010 --> 02:44:00.690]
No, they just want to save the money that's the excuse

[02:44:00.690 --> 02:44:01.790]
Plus they hit him like poison

[02:44:01.790 --> 02:44:02.250]
Yeah

[02:44:03.090 --> 02:44:04.570]
And they want to do it despite me

[02:44:04.950 --> 02:44:06.670]
Whatever I want they'll do the opposite

[02:44:07.730 --> 02:44:09.330]
So let's fire George what are you saying?

[02:44:09.490 --> 02:44:11.330]
See if I say that we ought to fire you then they'll

[02:44:11.330 --> 02:44:12.650]
Hey, maybe that'll help

[02:44:12.650 --> 02:44:14.830]
George and company did a great job in your absence

[02:44:14.830 --> 02:44:17.370]
Thought last Wednesdays and Thursdays shows when especially

[02:44:17.370 --> 02:44:20.530]
Using an educational you were educational I was talking to

[02:44:20.530 --> 02:44:21.270]
What did that start?

[02:44:21.750 --> 02:44:22.070]
I don't know

[02:44:22.070 --> 02:44:23.910]
You were talking about what religion you know?

[02:44:24.450 --> 02:44:24.830]
No

[02:44:25.370 --> 02:44:25.790]
Little bit

[02:44:26.190 --> 02:44:26.570]
Heathen

[02:44:26.570 --> 02:44:27.170]
I know

[02:44:27.170 --> 02:44:30.790]
As always the chronic colors were knit with but George did a good job handling them

[02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:33.650]
So I hope that George stays on the show as long as you both like take care of Vince

[02:44:33.650 --> 02:44:34.270]
Thank you Vince

[02:44:36.250 --> 02:44:40.250]
Kim says just saw the big ol' on a video at the QA and website

[02:44:40.970 --> 02:44:43.430]
Wow, not a face made for a video or in your lunch time

[02:44:43.950 --> 02:44:45.430]

[02:44:48.530 --> 02:44:50.710]

[02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:54.070]

[02:44:54.070 --> 02:44:58.470]
Yes, yesterday it was 27 it was like 81 degrees and now it's 7-45

[02:44:58.470 --> 02:44:59.570]
You wonder why people get sick?

[02:44:59.830 --> 02:45:01.290]
You wonder why they get this seasonal flu?

[02:45:01.630 --> 02:45:02.830]
Forget about the swine flu?

[02:45:03.290 --> 02:45:04.530]
What about the seasonal flu?

[02:45:05.790 --> 02:45:09.150]
The change of season one day it's freezing the next day it's hot as hell?

[02:45:09.690 --> 02:45:10.690]
Not good is it?

[02:45:10.690 --> 02:45:10.950]
No

[02:45:10.950 --> 02:45:12.370]
Not good for you

[02:45:15.770 --> 02:45:17.730]
The fake Doug says now see here

[02:45:18.570 --> 02:45:23.210]
If Joe Belfair is George I'll send George the pictures I have of Joe Bell and some other fat guy possibly Chris

[02:45:24.010 --> 02:45:27.330]
They were at the poppin of seafood festival on the beach sweating and rolling around in the sand

[02:45:27.330 --> 02:45:30.830]
Licking and kissing and they were so drunk they fell asleep with their heads between their legs

[02:45:31.230 --> 02:45:34.650]
The polis had to be called over for them to stop the obscene behavior that was going on

[02:45:34.650 --> 02:45:36.090]
Let me know if says the fake Doug

[02:45:36.590 --> 02:45:40.510]

Now maybe if I could get a spittoon in here what do you think?

[02:45:45.070 --> 02:45:46.010]
You should always have a spittoon in here

[02:45:46.010 --> 02:45:47.230]
I get a big juggerlisterine

[02:45:47.230 --> 02:45:50.390]

[02:45:51.470 --> 02:45:53.350]
A big spittoon

[02:45:53.350 --> 02:45:58.710]
I think what I mean we can't fart but we can certainly spit at least as of now

[02:45:58.710 --> 02:45:59.170]
Right?

[02:45:59.330 --> 02:46:01.510]
Probably get a memo from Joyce tomorrow no more spits

[02:46:07.350 --> 02:46:11.890]
Hors-hay-bush says if George gets fired we will burn higher lead to the ground

[02:46:12.630 --> 02:46:16.530]
And hang glide naked over the palm of that or expressway until he's reinstalled

[02:46:16.530 --> 02:46:18.370]
George will be bigger than alien

[02:46:18.370 --> 02:46:21.610]

Neil asked you if a rabbi was a priest didn't respond what's your answer?

[02:46:33.070 --> 02:46:34.150]
I thought I did respond

[02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:34.910]
What did you say?

[02:46:35.230 --> 02:46:35.970]
I think I said yes

[02:46:35.970 --> 02:46:37.050]
