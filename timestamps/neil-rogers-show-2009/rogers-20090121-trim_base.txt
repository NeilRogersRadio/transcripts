[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380]
Music expressed on the previous program.

[00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.820]
Sounds like your night is already spoken for George.

[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.540]
Oh yeah.

[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.840]

[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.000]
You're listening to sports radio 560W.

[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.360]

[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.980]
Miami for the Lauderdale.

[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.220]
What's that?

[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.540]
What is it?

[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.800]
What is this for?

[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.260]
What?

[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.840]
Punish me with this.

[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.920]
With W?

[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.580]
Yeah.

[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.760]
Happy and saddest.

[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.160]
Is it over, Duffy? He's gone.

[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.540]
Is it over? I saw him flying over to help after God's help.

[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.300]
Oh, happy day!

[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.520]
Now we've got to have a retrospective and kiss his butt.

[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.200]
Just play the opening shot off.

[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.840]

Anybody want it?

[00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.960]
No.

[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.640]
Come on.

[00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.920]
No.

[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.060]

[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.060]

[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.040]
Or sponsors.

[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.900]
Now the Neil Roger Show.

[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.700]
On 560WQAM.

[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.100]
Neil.

[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.380]
Yeah.

[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.200]
Fellow citizens.

[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.380]
For eight years it has been my honor to serve as your president.

[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.400]
What's life going to be like?

[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.420]
What are you going to do now?

[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.760]
I am confident I'll be driven to do something.

[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.220]
I just can't tell you what it is yet.

[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.840]
This January health is on the way.

[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.540]
Reports are there inside the bank.

[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.520]
Only man for the job.

[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.640]
George W. Bush.

[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.420]
Mall cop.

[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.700]
I know that human being and fish can coagge just peacefully.

[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.320]
He's always been dedicated.

[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.260]
It's fool me once.

[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.340]
Shame on you.

[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.300]
It's fool me.

[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.200]
Can't get fooled again.

[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.660]
Yeah.

[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.500]
I'm too protected.

[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.440]
Too many OBGYNs aren't able to practice their love with women.

[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.820]
The last thing they expected.

[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.960]
I hear this rumors on the internet.

[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.240]
Who is this guy?

[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.320]
I'm George W. Bush.

[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.060]
Mall cop.

[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.420]
And I think the world would be better off if we did leave.

[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.500]
If we left the world, the world is better off or does not leave.

[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.520]
You're an idiot.

[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.260]
I'm George W. Bush.

[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.260]
Mall cop.

I'm George W.

I'm George W.

[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.280]
I'm George W.

[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.280]

[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.980]
I'm George W.

[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.620]
I'm George W.

[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.140]
I'm George W.

I'm George W.

[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.960]
I'm George W.

[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.300]
I'm George W.

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.300]

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.300]

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.300]

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.300]

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.300]

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.300]

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.300]

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.300]

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.300]

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.300]

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.300]

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.300]

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.400]
I'm George W.

[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.400]

[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.400]

[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.400]

[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.980]
I'm George W.

[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.980]

[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.440]
I'm George W.

[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.800]
I'm George W.

[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.300]
I'm George W.

[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.760]
I'm George W.

[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.740]
I'm George W.

[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.420]
I'm George W.

[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.820]
I'm George W.

[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.260]
I'm George W.

[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.960]
I'm George W.

[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.400]
I'm George W.

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.400]

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.400]

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.400]

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.400]

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.400]

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.400]

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.400]

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.400]

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.400]

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.400]

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.400]

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.020]
Oh, do they ever.

[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.800]
Maybe something in the audience.

[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:48.940]
That was a lot of the shadows I got and I was lucky six months in the last time I saw this and my

[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.260]
All this crap about the Obama bubble.

[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.500]
Yeah.

[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.740]
Obama, a bump or whatever they were calling it, we were going to see yesterday in the market

[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.580]
based on what?

[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.900]
He got elected back in November for crying out loud.

[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.860]
So it's no surprise he was going to get inaugurated.

[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.620]
Didn't sneak up on you at all, did it?

[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.940]
No.

[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.980]
But the market goes down 300 and some points.

[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.860]
Oh, where's the Obama bounce we were supposed to be?

[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.400]
That again has dumb people buying into the crap.

[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.300]
They peddle you on the gambling channel, including Maria B and all the other hucksters on

[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.400]
it.

[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.160]
That's all they are.

[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.120]
It's a bunch of hucksters peddling crap.

[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.320]
Oh, let's put some lipstick on this pig.

[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.400]
How those people aren't all in federal prison, I have no idea.

[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.440]
What they did to people and their incomes, people work a whole lifetime.

[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.220]
And then all of a sudden they wake up one day and, oh, I've been fed a bunch of crap,

[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.160]
you know, burning me it off with all my money.

[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.000]
Or the enron people made off with all my money.

[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.660]
Or some hucksters on the gambling channel, CNBC, sold me a pill of goods about the new economy

[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.200]
as opposed to the old economy.

[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.800]
All of a sudden a bunch of lies, they're just peddling.

[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.600]
Don't you understand?

[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.760]
Because if you people stop buying, then they're out of business.

[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.760]
That's all they got to sell is lies and bullcrap.

[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.540]
Oh, it's a buying opportunity.

[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.560]
A bunch of fakers is all they are.

[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.420]
They're a bunch of carny barkers.

[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.740]
Do you ever read about the old carny workers?

[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.400]

[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.480]
Hooray, hooray, hooray.

[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.140]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.460]
I'd like to take a look at the two headed side show for only 25 cents.

[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.200]
That kind of thing.

[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.820]
Oh, I don't want serious as a website.

[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.920]
Seriously?

[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.040]
I'm serious.

[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.940]
I want to see the, here we go, the stock report.

[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.280]
It was 11 cents yesterday.

[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.900]
I didn't check it yet this morning.

[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.500]
So I'm checking it now.

[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.720]
If it goes down to a dime, all bets are off.

[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.380]
Oh, it's still 11 cents.

[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.300]
It's hanging in there nice.

[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.580]
Although it's down fractionally.

[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.160]
In other words, it's like 10.98 or something like that.

[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.160]
Oh, there's swallery and boba at the morning prayer.

[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.680]
Well, President Clinton and now Hillary Clinton,

[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.880]
not just the president, Secretary of State.

[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.540]
I'm continuing to look at those pictures.

[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.380]
So sorry, Brianna.

[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.740]
I certainly did need to cut you off.

[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.660]
And the show there is so much going on today.

[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.940]
Would you think his dancing, my son?

[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.660]
Do you see any of that at the inaugural balls?

[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.420]
Yeah, and I don't know.

[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.000]
It left me kind of like a limp.

[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.280]
I just don't think, well, you know, we didn't elect him because he's a great dancer.

[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.960]
I just thought that their dancing was what I guess they're not going to be on dancing

[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.980]
to what the stars know.

[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.020]
I wouldn't think so.

[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.460]
Although maybe they were auditioning.

[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.840]
I don't know.

[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.220]
Maybe.

[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.340]
Isn't that what we're supposed to be?

[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.700]
The new American hobby while everybody's starving to death and nobody's got a job.

[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.780]
And like I said, you know, he's not going to like magically.

[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.020]
Although here's the information about the beginning.

[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.820]
And his first act is president Obama approved a memo by White House Chief of Staff.

[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.740]
Ram, I'm very Jewish, Emmanuel, which orders all federal agencies to freeze.

[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.420]
Former president Bush's pending regulations until the new administration has a chance

[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.220]
to review them.

[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.660]
On his new website, Whitehouse.gov, the president also wishes a proclamation

[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.540]
that January 20th 2009 is to be a national day of renewal and reconciliation.

[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.420]
Of course, today's the 21st.

[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.460]
So that that's all over with president Obama called upon all Americans to serve one

[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.480]
another as a way of helping remake this nation.

[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.780]
Here I am serving you folks.

[00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.820]
The price is right.

[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.820]
Doesn't cost you a dime.

[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.100]
And we're giving you free entertainment such as it is four hours a day.

[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.860]
That thing you told me about Joe Bell makes me want to do a real big

[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.240]
choice right in the cheer here.

[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.140]
Oh, we're going to renew our effort.

[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.460]
You're full of crap, Joe.

[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.200]
You're full of crap.

[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.080]
You and your Yahoo sales manager from Raleigh, okay?

[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.100]
You're full of crap.

[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.820]
Why would I waste my time with that nonsense?

[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.580]
What you're talking?

[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.880]
I don't know.

[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.020]
You know what?

[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.940]
You should tell him you should just spit in his face.

[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.380]
Say he's not going to waste his time talking to you.

[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.700]
What?

[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.900]
Nothing.

[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.480]
Well, when you when you let out that breath of road that grown right?

[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.480]
Why don't you play along?

[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.020]
And then if nothing happens, then you'll, then you can say,

[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.100]
Hey, look, I played it along.

[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.340]
How many times can you play along with the same BS?

[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.720]
How many times fool me once can't get fooled again?

[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.060]
Like W just said.

[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.360]
Well, maybe they're serious this time.

[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.240]
No, serial.

[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.120]
Yeah, 11 cent.

[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.240]
I'll say just some serial.

[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.540]
You want some serial?

[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.360]
Frosted flakes.

[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.900]
I love them.

[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:52.900]
I could eat them out of the box.

[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:53.840]
I want some golden grams.

[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.160]
You know, that's funny, though.

[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.080]
All the bad stuff that I eat with my diabetes and everything

[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.560]
and my blood sugar is really, really bad.

[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.300]
I never go, of course, I, well, yeah,

[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.700]
I do go to the supermarket once in a while,

[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.700]
but I never dawns on me.

[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.320]
Thank goodness.

[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.380]
It never dawns on me to buy like cereal

[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.180]
because I can eat it right out of the box, right?

[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.860]
I'm not going to buy milk because I don't like milk.

[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.400]
I know.

[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.580]
I don't think that another animal's milk is designed

[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.200]
to be drink, you're drinking the bios.

[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.080]
We cheese.

[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:20.840]
What?

[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:21.700]
We cheese.

[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.360]
I don't know why because I like the way it tastes.

[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.700]
All right.

[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.040]
I don't like the way milk tastes at all.

[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:27.740]
It tastes like milk.

[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.660]
You know, crap.

[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.460]
There's two different things.

[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.580]
You don't like the way it tastes fine,

[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.120]
but you're eating another animal's milk.

[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.060]
So, OK.

[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:34.100]
OK.

[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.900]
But I mean, in the form that I like, at least it tastes good.

[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.900]
I like cheese, although it comes up your innards.

[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.380]
I'd ice cream.

[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.280]
Although I don't have any problem.

[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.040]
Oh, yeah, of course ice cream is another milk product

[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:42.500]
in a dairy.

[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.340]
What about the chocolate?

[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:45.700]
What about cacao?

[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:46.780]
What's called?

[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.640]
What about cacao moon?

[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:48.960]
Cacao.

[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.520]
Trino is where President Barack Obama is taking the first step

[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.280]
to closing the infamous President Guantana

[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.020]
Will Bay asking military prosecutors

[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.340]
to suspend legal proceedings for 120 days.

[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.280]
Military judge agreed to suspend one case immediately

[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.000]
this morning, and the fate of other cases

[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.360]
is expected to be determined pronto fast.

[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.460]
A military judge has agreed to Obama's request

[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.040]
to suspend the Gitmo War Crime's trial of Canadian Omar

[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.560]
Carter, who was 15 years old when he was arrested.

[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.300]
And the people here are really pissed off

[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.220]
and parked off about it, parked off and pissed off.

[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.400]
I don't know how that goes.

[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.540]
They're not happy.

[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.300]
So he's suspending the war crimes trial.

[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.680]
You got it?

[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.260]
He's not wasting any time.

[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.240]
He's getting right to it.

[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.160]
Going to close up Gitmo.

[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.180]
He's going to put a bunch of...

[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.840]
How do you really think he's going to...

[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.440]
Going to put a bunch of fagilas in the military

[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.180]
so they can bunk down together?

[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.480]
It's wrong with that.

[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.120]
Nothing?

[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.780]
Now here's one.

[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.000]
Here's my emails.

[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.480]
I got a whole bunch of them, as you would expect.

[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.920]
But a lot of negative ones, which I just shmit can't.

[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.500]
I deleted them.

[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.740]
I'm so tired of the...

[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.400]
I mean, I'm supposed to be Mr. Negative,

[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.700]
but I'm like positively abulliant.

[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.760]
Remember the abulliant guy that Jack asked?

[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.680]
I'm abulliant compared to most of these losers.

[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.360]
Oh, jeez, he's not going to be able to do this.

[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.620]
Well, you know what?

[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.780]
So the world is corrupt and the government is corrupt

[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.580]
and it's run by a band of thieves and gypsies.

[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.620]
And what are we going to do?

[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.760]
He's not going to like, yeah, we'll see what he can do.

[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.920]
At least he gives you a little bit of hope.

[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.740]
What more than, how can you hope for than hope?

[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:15.620]
Right?

[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:16.120]
Right.

[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.100]
I hope.

[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.780]
So I may vent...

[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.540]
Is the name of the person...

[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.220]
The handle of the person who sent me this email.

[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:25.660]
Yeah.

[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.400]
So I may vent.

[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.180]
And fake email for the occasion?

[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.260]
That's correct.

[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.060]
Aren't they all?

[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:30.420]
Yes.

[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.560]
Don't know if you're in today or if it's George,

[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.700]
but I'll be listening, at least to the opening segment.

[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.040]
Now, now what does that mean?

[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.280]
I don't know if you're going to be in today?

[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.240]
Well, what's today?

[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.540]
The day after an auguration day?

[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.040]
Is it a holiday?

[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.020]
I guess.

[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.380]
Please don't get me wrong by my...

[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:43.600]
You...

[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.280]
...accounted my previous emails.

[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.280]
I'm a fan.

[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.220]
I admit I don't listen constantly,

[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.860]
but I do love the smart assesms

[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.000]
and the way you drive a show in George's 2.

[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.380]
I'm driving it.

[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.740]
There's no way I can be sincere in a letter

[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.480]
and expect you to be gushy on the ear.

[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.860]
And I dare say I expect no return from this email.

[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:00.740]
Well, I'm reading it.

[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.240]
But anyways, I do listen.

[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.620]
I do hear it and I do enjoy.

[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.200]
I'm curious, this is the part that gets me.

[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:06.740]
Okay.

[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.760]
How many years we've been...

[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.540]
I've been reading the ratings on the ear on this show.

[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.160]
100...

[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:10.680]
...100 years.

[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.180]
We don't make them up.

[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.320]
We don't lie about them.

[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.700]
We don't pretend to be number-un when we're not.

[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.420]
We give you exactly what the numbers are.

[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.300]
And believe me, the last two years under Jolly Jobelle,

[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.640]
they have sucked big time.

[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:21.100]
They blow.

[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.540]
Not as bad as some other people on the ear,

[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.320]
like the idiots across the street most of the day,

[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.900]
but nevertheless, I'm curious on the true stats

[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.180]
and the true ratings for the show.

[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.800]
Every GD station in town says their number-one,

[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.600]
God, I hate Bushmen and the fans.

[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.700]
Well, we don't Bushmen anybody

[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.760]
about ratings on this show.

[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.340]
We're number-four.

[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:37.540]
That's right.

[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.540]
We're number-four, we're proud of it.

[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.760]
We had a 4.6 share in men 2554,

[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.140]
which is not all that bad, considering.

[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:43.600]
Relatively.

[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.680]
Not all that great, considering we used to do double-lad,

[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.460]
but considering the idiots that we work for,

[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.740]
and considering some of the stuff they put on around us,

[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.280]
oh my God, I don't want to mention...

[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.000]
Rock solid.

[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.360]
That's bad with that 1.1.

[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.860]
I don't want to mention that 9 to 10 hour at night with a point.

[00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.060]

[00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.000]
And would I make that up?

[00:11:59.160 --> 00:11:59.940]
Who would make that up?

[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:00.240]
Right.

[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.520]
If I wanted to, I couldn't make that up.

[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.740]
The idea that this radio station is once great,

[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.760]
prominent AM station could have a point before midnight,

[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.180]
before anybody was like even in bed, 9 o'clock at night.

[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.480]
And once upon a time, I'm old enough to remember it,

[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.880]
and I was a part of it, once upon a time at night,

[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.800]
on WS News and WYNZ, night time 8 to midnight

[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.620]
was primo-dlistening time.

[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.560]
Yeah, so the demos were old, but we had gigantic numbers.

[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.400]
10 and 11 shares, which doesn't sound like a point to me,

[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.200]
but nevertheless, no way in this joint,

[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.340]
they wouldn't be able to sell it anyway.

[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.560]
If they had a 20-year...

[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.800]
Oh, well nobody's listening at night and I'm...

[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.580]
You know, you wouldn't want to buy any spots, would you?

[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.540]
I was speaking of taco smell.

[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.420]
Well, I'll get to this story.

[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.840]
Man accused of a less-ting boy at Plant City Taco smell.

[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:44.480]
Okay.

[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.980]
One of these days, before January ends,

[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.160]
I vow to have a meal at Taco smell.

[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.700]
I love it.

[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.100]
And Mr. Yesterday, did you go?

[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.040]
No, no.

[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.720]
It was 20 tacos for...what was it?

[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.460]
Like, I don't know, 10 cent tacos, 27, I don't know where it was.

[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:02.680]
But I missed out.

[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:02.900]
Wow.

[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:03.500]
I missed out.

[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.340]
No, one guy, he just shoveled him down.

[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.300]
Shove him down is good.

[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.600]
Have any of it a plunger in?

[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.740]
Was this shoving him down there?

[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.300]
Only in the Banana Republic, baby.

[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.320]
Only in Miami.

[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:26.040]
What were rusting and what right up to my knees?

[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.360]
Oh, I was in the sky of the...

[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:29.800]
You fell.

[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.320]
Now I'm in a superee.

[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:34.900]
What?

[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.540]
What were stored and freezing my toes?

[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:47.200]
A bag of blue diamond nuts is floating by my nose.

[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.100]
Under me, the Hudson I could see.

[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.720]
A rocking porch with both his feet.

[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.420]
In a bucket of concrete.

[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.580]
Rock solid.

[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.960]
You're lucky for me.

[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.040]
I think take a stroll along the wings.

[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.960]
Thanks to a flock of stupid bees.

[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.980]
That means the water rush gears.

[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.820]
Cools Russian.

[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.680]
I remember Rick Nelson had a recording of that, among many others.

[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:25.220]
Yep.

[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:26.900]
Remember that in Fouls Russian?

[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:27.520]
Oh well.

[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.380]
No, not you at it?

[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:30.720]
I got it all, man.

[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.180]
And if I don't got it, I'll get it.

[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.060]
You'll make it up.

[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:33.800]
You'll sing it.

[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.240]
Guess why I have an email from here?

[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:37.720]
Remember.

[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:38.540]
No.

[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.580]
Worst than that.

[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.080]
Somebody who claims she's going to be starting on this station in February.

[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.180]
Oh, the phony I need to mark?

[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.780]
This isn't the phony I need to mark.

[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.720]
This is the real I need to mark the spot.

[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.200]
Rick Nelson, he's still dead by the way.

[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.780]
That's what he meant.

[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:52.920]

[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.340]
Really?

[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.940]
No, it's Rick Nelson by this time.

[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.500]
Was it Rickie on his recorder?

[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.080]
Yes.

[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.900]
Oh, I have no idea.

[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:03.960]
I'm not a ghost.

[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.480]
63?

[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:05.960]
Yes.

[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.280]
There you go.

[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.440]
Good guess.

[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:10.640]
I'll take it.

[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:11.480]
Hi, Neil.

[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.240]
While my guys couldn't quite pull it off in Pittsburgh, they stunk.

[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.780]
Looks like it's time to trade in my purple and black for Aqua in Orange.

[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.020]
I'll be wrapping up my duties for 1300 AM in Baltimore during Super Bowl week on January 30th.

[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.600]
Unlike most in our business, I'll get a chance to say goodbye to all my faithful listeners

[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.940]
as I turn the page on this chapter of my career.

[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.100]
It's time to look forward to my new home on WQA.

[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.420]
When I start in February, I sure won't miss the winner in both Mr. Bell and Mr. Darrow.

[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.860]
Mr. Darrow.

[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.200]
Oh my God.

[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.040]
What a putz.

[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:45.380]
Have assured me that the station is going to run a tremendous promotional campaign to support my move to Miami.

[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.880]
I just can't thank them enough for the opportunity to join the premier sports talk station in America.

[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.780]
Boy, you talk about living in the past.

[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.780]
Certainly, hope there's enough room for two queens on WQA.

[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.160]
So I guess they're going to stick Orlando on at night.

[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.960]
They're going to blow out the amp putter in two to four.

[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.280]
Another failure.

[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.500]
Now that I'm able to narrow down my starting date, I'm able to focus on my support team.

[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.560]
Can you pass along my email address to that QD Pie Chris Whalen?

[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.440]
Oh, I didn't know that Anita was a vision challenged.

[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.180]
I need a right hand man I can trust.

[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.400]
I'm sure he can produce for me if you know what I mean, wink.

[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.900]
I really need to get a hold of him so we can get together.

[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.740]
Anyway, time to get going and start packing boxes.

[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.960]
Thanks for being so supportive Anita marks.

[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.400]
Oh my God.

[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.020]
He's really coming by the way.

[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:32.700]
All right.

[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:33.620]
Great.

[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:40.380]
I think what I just gave you it's just a guess, but I think that you know based on a little bit of information we had from Barry Jackass, real or imaginary the other day.

[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:40.800]
Mm hmm.

[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.760]
About how they're moving a big old tonight's and they're blowing out D.A.

[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.420]
Well, B.D.A. has got a point.

[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.980]
Oh, oh, he's got some really astonishing numbers there at night.

[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.940]
Then what will they be doing from two to four?

[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:51.680]
Anita marks.

[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.360]
Anita marks.

[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.060]
What might I want to hear my psychic prediction?

[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:55.880]
Go ahead.

[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.140]
It's going to suck and it's going to fail.

[00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.660]
Well, that's because Joe likes it.

[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.040]
Joe and clearance like it so it's going to suck and it's going to fail.

[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.940]
Everything we put on from two to four has been just a...

[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.560]
In fact, everything Jolly Jo is put on has been a disaster.

[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.180]
Everything he's put on the year has been a mitigated disaster.

[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.900]
Jerks, Kenny and Blow and at Horrible Morning Show.

[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.060]
D.A. at night with a point at nine o'clock.

[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.120]
And not much else around it.

[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.840]
I mean, you can only blame lead ins and follow ups and, you know, so long.

[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.360]
And when you can't even break a chair, you're not...

[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.960]
You're not attracted much of an audience.

[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.380]
Even when you can't hear the signal four blocks away.

[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.860]
Well, that's a good thing they don't care about ratings.

[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.180]
That's right.

[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:35.900]
I forgot about that.

[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.720]
They don't care about ratings.

[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.900]
They care about football.

[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:38.580]
The smell.

[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.400]
The smell of jock straps.

[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.320]
That's what permeates the building.

[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:46.880]
If you walked in there, man, the sweaty, smelly uniforms and jock straps.

[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.900]
They're hung up on...

[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.220]
Yeah.

[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.920]
I thought it was illegal to hang laundry out on the line, but they have it all over the building.

[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:52.840]
They hang it on their faces.

[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.440]
No, yeah, on their push.

[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.400]
Here's the pull from yesterday.

[00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.660]
952 votes.

[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.200]
If I hit the power ball, the first thing I would do besides quit my job is, and by the way,

[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.160]
you won't hit the power ball.

[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.600]
But anyway, if you did, travel around the world 230.

[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:05.680]
That was my vote.

[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:06.820]
A lot of traveling.

[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.540]
I'm a traveling man.

[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.760]
There's Rick Nelson again, see?

[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.140]
On Imperial Records.

[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:12.700]
We'll take a little effect all day.

[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:13.360]
What?

[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.660]
We'll have all Rick Nelson all day.

[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:15.600]
Okay, go ahead.

[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.220]
Invested wisely, 166.

[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.420]
Make a list of all the friends and family I want to give money to, 159.

[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.340]
I'm already doing that.

[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.480]
Leaves South Florida 135.

[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.360]
Already done that.

[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.480]
Oh, thank God.

[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.440]
Get a divorce and bang only young chicks, 101.

[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.900]
Buy a big bag of the good stuff, 75.

[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.800]
Traveling, man, this was the first video, music video, and history.

[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.740]
I'm a traveling man.

[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:41.280]
Did you know that?

[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.000]
I fully heard it.

[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:42.420]
Yes.

[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.320]
The genius of Ozzy knows.

[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.900]
All over the world.

[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.860]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.260]
He had to be a genius because anybody that could take a family as boring as the Nelson's

[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.140]
and make a lot of money off that show.

[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.660]
I mean, God, were they boring?

[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.120]
Oh.

[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.440]
Boring.

[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.920]
Ozzy and Harriet never saw it.

[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.500]
Boring.

[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.680]
And even the next door neighbor, Thornie, he was boring.

[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.340]
Wonder if Thornie was horny.

[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.440]
Run Jimmy Cifalos out at an appointment.

[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.280]
Send George a big check to quit the show 28.

[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.560]
He wouldn't quit the show.

[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.660]
You sent him 10 million.

[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.620]
He'd still be here tomorrow.

[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.200]
That's right.

[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:21.960]
Yeah.

[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:23.620]
Get triad.

[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.420]
Triad.

[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.280]
Send him a bunch of money and see if he shows up.

[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.220]
Put it to the test.

[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.380]
Run Jimmy Cifalidic out of town 18.

[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.920]
Boy, his number sure were pretty weak.

[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:31.420]
Mediocre.

[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.120]
Check in on expensive rehab 16.

[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.560]
Go to the track and plunge my guts out 12.

[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.620]
And become immersed in my favorite charities only 12.

[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.560]
My whole life is a charity.

[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.620]
Maybe I need to stop doing that.

[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.380]
Maybe I should just take off after the show today

[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.240]
and never be seen again.

[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.300]
I could do that, you know.

[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.900]
Well, you don't have to resort to that.

[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.800]
Well, what's the alternative?

[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.980]
Just stop cutting checks.

[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.880]
Cutting checks for home.

[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:56.900]
Everybody.

[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.560]
Greenfield, California.

[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.780]
Felicia for rest of the Greenfield man

[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.840]
allegedly arranging to sell his 14 year old daughter into marriage

[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.520]
in exchange for 16 grand 100 cases of beer and several cases of meat.

[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.020]
Police said they only learned of the deal after the 36 year old man went to them

[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.980]
to get his daughter back because payment wasn't made as promised.

[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.700]
The man was arrested Sunday on suspicion of human trafficking.

[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:24.880]
He went to the police.

[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:25.800]
What a moron.

[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.880]
Officers also arrested 18 year old man on suspicion of statutory rape.

[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.280]
The girls 14 years old.

[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.540]
Now this is like an India, right?

[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:35.720]
With a dowry and all that crap?

[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.440]
I guess, yeah.

[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.960]
Investigators believe the girl went willingly with the man,

[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:43.240]
but she's under California's legal age, a consent, and can't legally marry.

[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.720]
Police say arranged marriages involving underage girls have begun a problem.

[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.360]
The small central coast farming community, Greenfield, California.

[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.280]
So there you go, George.

[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.940]
Somebody going to send you all that money and go marry some young chick.

[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.320]
Some hot, young thing.

[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.360]
No, thanks. I'm not looking for extra wives.

[00:20:59.320 --> 00:20:59.860]
For what?

[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:00.980]
Extra wives.

[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:05.460]
Why don't we marry, but I mean, you know, in a general sense.

[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.320]
No, thank you. Not for me.

[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.300]
In a familial sense.

[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.120]
That's not my bag, baby.

[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.880]
Oh, getting back to that plant city taco smell.

[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.280]
A 22 year old man was arrested yesterday afternoon accused of molesting a four year old boy in the restroom

[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.380]
of a plant city taco bell, according to a criminal arrest affidavit.

[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:20.760]
Wow.

[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.660]
Ryan Wetzel-Lauri, a plant city was charged with ludenal civil sex with a child,

[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.360]
ludenal civil molestation of a child in false imprisonment.

[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.820]
Lauri's accused of following the boy into the men's restroom of the taco smell at 2442 James L. Redmond Parkway.

[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.560]
Plant city police say Lauri pulled the boy into a handicap, Stalin molested him.

[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:39.580]
Four year old boy.

[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.120]
According to the affidavit, the boy's grandfather walked into the restroom, witnessed the incident called a police.

[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.540]
Sick.

[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.100]
Really, really, really.

[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:51.660]
Sick.

[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.360]
I wonder if Brian is a...

[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.420]
Jones had to become a priest, you think?

[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.440]
I was just going to say.

[00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:58.060]
Yeah.

[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.880]
Then he can legally alter boys.

[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.860]
I was the poor for today, come and have a look at that.

[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.280]
All that poll talk.

[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.400]
There you go with the numbers again.

[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.280]
He's mailing it in.

[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.040]
Pull, pull, pull.

[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:10.560]
I'll ask you.

[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.180]
I can do it like you did.

[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.820]
Oh, like that one.

[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.400]
You're my bitch or whatever that idiot said.

[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:19.720]
That's it.

[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.260]
Which most closely fits your bathroom hygiene.

[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.120]
This is Charlie B. He was a real sicko.

[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.080]
464 votes so far.

[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.580]
Drop a Joyce wash hands always 277.

[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.040]
Of course.

[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.160]
Drop a Joyce wash hands sometime, 127.

[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.080]
Wash hands.

[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.860]
Drop a Joyce wash hands again, 33.

[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.320]
Why do you have to wash your hands before you drop a Joyce?

[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.760]
You never know.

[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.400]
Drop a Joyce.

[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:43.180]
Never wash hands.

[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.340]
22 real slabs.

[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.200]
Can you imagine what they smell like?

[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.060]
No, thank you.

[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.500]
Wash hands. Drop a Joyce and don't wash hands.

[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:49.880]
Five.

[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.120]
I see out of 464 votes.

[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.060]
Howard David's a bitch.

[00:22:59.240 --> 00:22:59.840]
Absolutely.

[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.540]
You step aside and all you hear is coughing and sneezes.

[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.700]
Your nose can even run because when it starts it just frees.

[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.880]
It's spreading on your face like you've been sprayed with lace.

[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.320]
You take up all your layers inside but the cold lakers.

[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.360]
You feel an icy tingling your toes and your fingers.

[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.660]
And you just want to cry.

[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.060]
Your pros and cons.

[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.720]
Because it is so damn cold.

[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.440]
You can't unfold your hands up.

[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.400]
Told it turns off your sweat glands.

[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.820]
It sounds not strong.

[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:52.020]
Enough to warn yourself that's how it goes.

[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.180]
Winter blows.

[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.580]
Your coat is so gigantic you cannot feel a tick.

[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.180]
Go, you're walking down the street just like a human.

[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.320]
I say, though you're a freaking store, no learn.

[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.200]
It's not working like it sure.

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.480]
Because it is so damn cold.

[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:26.160]
You can't unfold your hands up.

[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.240]
Told it turns off your sweat glands.

[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:39.300]
The sun's not strong enough to warn yourself that's how it goes.

[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.300]
Winter blows.

[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.720]
You feel like you've been subvying this warm of killer bees.

[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.380]
Because the cold makes your clothes feel like they made a twist.

[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.920]
Cheese, this nothing you can do.

[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.180]
Your lips just turn blue.

[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.400]
You know I just noticed that I thought it was me.

[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.700]
I thought maybe my hearing was going one of the channels is missing from that bit.

[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.400]
Really?

[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.520]
It's like in mono.

[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.100]
I don't mean it's like in mono.

[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:13.800]
They're all in mono.

[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.360]
You know what I mean?

[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.220]
Because one of the VUs is just barely who knows.

[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.340]
It's Todd Pettenkiel.

[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:21.900]
So what are you sure?

[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:22.360]
Nothing.

[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.680]
The fake Alice Rantel who's absolutely the worst of all the fakeers.

[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:26.880]
You know what is?

[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.820]
I'm sure it's Mr. Radio.

[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.600]
Always asking me a bunch of stupid inside radio crap.

[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.060]
Here's one of them from today which I won't read the other ones.

[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.780]
Hi Neil, I heard you mentioned Alan Birk has today.

[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.260]
Were you friendly with him off the air?

[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.320]
Al.

[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.000]
No I was not friendly with him off the air.

[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.540]
I met him once in my life I do believe.

[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.820]
And that's when they were interviewing me to replace him at INZ.

[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.300]
It's kind of awkward.

[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.360]
Or is I friendly with him off the air?

[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.680]
Oh God.

[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.940]
This is the motto of South Florida.

[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:57.640]
I have no life.

[00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:58.680]
Oh my goodness.

[00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.380]
I have no life.

[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.140]
I have no life.

[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:00.820]
I have no life.

[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:01.500]
I have no life.

[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.600]
I'm just playing that for four hours every day.

[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.160]
I have no life.

[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:05.500]
I'm telling you.

[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.040]
I have no life.

[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:06.540]
That's the new format.

[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.580]
I'm smelling you right now.

[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.260]
I have no life.

[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.500]
The only people I was friendly with off there that I ever worked with in radio was Bill

[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.600]
Calder and Stan Major.

[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.000]
Bill Calder, okay DC's and Stan Major might as well be as far as the business is concerned.

[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.320]
Remember we heard from Stan a couple weeks ago when we got Stan Major intensive and I

[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.460]
fake Johnny Dork and this fake one and that fake one all.

[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.260]
Oh you got to have Stan on the air.

[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:28.540]
Yeah.

[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.320]
You know that most of this crap is coming from across the street.

[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.720]
Anything they can do to cut it.

[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:32.840]
That's right.

[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.080]
That's right.

[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.600]
Anything they can do to try to sabotage the show.

[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.420]
Oh we're going to plant the seeds of doubt in the old man's mind.

[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.320]
We're going to make them think he's really lost it.

[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.000]
Yeah, screw you.

[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.760]
Screw you wannabes.

[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:44.500]
Why?

[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.880]
And of course the only reason that these people here care about them across the street is because

[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.400]
it spars.

[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.020]
Spars.

[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:54.100]
Because they're talking the same turd burger garbage that you hear on this station all.

[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.300]
I mean you know Orlando at the senior bowl two to four this afternoon that you get a big

[00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.860]
number starting with a.

[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:04.760]
Oh hurricane let's see mad dog four to seven hurricane's warm up seven to seven thirty

[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:09.640]
canes and FSU basketball seven thirty that you get a gigantic list of audience and then

[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.960]
after the game the D.A. show with its point share.

[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:19.020]
I'll tell you jolly joey you may not be good but you sure are consistent and George little

[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.500]
George he had his thumb in it.

[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.460]
Oh hey how you doing?

[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:25.060]
Like you said if jolly joe and clearance like it it's going to suck and it's going to

[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:25.480]
fail.

[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.360]
Like this and eat a mark show two to four that's coming next month or whenever the

[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.720]
house she's going to be on maybe she'll be on ten to two.

Just keep the checks coming joe she can have it.

[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.760]
Millions of cubicle dwellers across the country help set records for internet traffic yesterday

[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.280]
as they watched online video of the inauguration ceremonies or at least tried to the overwhelming

[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.360]
demand that some websites and data networks had trouble keeping up.

[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:55.700]
Between eleven thirty in the morning and twelve thirty in the PM accessing websites which

[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:59.460]
carried the swearing in and speech was difficult if not impossible depending on your connection.

[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:05.860]
CNN dot com's inauguration broadcast was a watershed event wrote Richard Greenfield

[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.100]
an analyst with Pally Capitol.

[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:07.700]
Pally.

[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.420]
Hey Pally.

[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.460]
And then it's got a bunch of links here.

[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.320]
Newspaper covers from around the world and yada yada yada.

[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.680]
People push his print deadline and again out special inaugural double issue.

[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.200]
Well good for people magazine.

[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.920]
Good to come and drop for them right.

[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:23.780]
Yep.

[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.500]
Here's one that's going to make you well it's not surprising especially with the people

[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.620]
that we deal with every day.

[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.280]
Last night while browsing msnbc dot com that were displaying comments written by people

[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.820]
on the main page regarding the oh and by the let me interrupt this I've got one here

[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.220]
about them.

[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.640]
Oh my god it's in here somewhere.

[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:48.700]
Not probably somewhere about the what's your name Rachel Mato and the reason that here

[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:49.100]
it is.

[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.140]
I'll get back to this other one in a second.

[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.380]
The problem I bookmarked it.

[00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:00.120]
The reason why you did not hear the inauguration audience singing to Bush Nana hey hey good

[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.540]
bias because you weren't tuned in NBC msnbc during the presidential inauguration well guess

[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:04.780]
what.

[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.820]
If I wasn't turned in msnbc then how come we had Keith Oberman's voice on there his

[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.060]
dulcet tones during most of the coverage we carry.

[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.440]
Right right we had a little bit of Wolf Blitzkrieg earlier in Anderson's pooper but I got really

[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.420]
tired of that we turned over to msnbc very early on.

[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:27.340]
You were not tuned to msnbc that's alive be it because of your loads in this disposition

[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.460]
of Rachel Mato or whatever your part you pardon but you missed what the audience said to

[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:38.680]
his face how be it twice and you ought to see the the address the email address this person

[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:45.000]
I can't use the words on here but nevertheless Brent and then a few other other made up for

[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.060]
the occasion email no these are words having to do with the male genitalia I see.

[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:54.000]
While watching the presidential inauguration of our new president Barack Obama in msnbc

[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.520]
I got to say it did you notice Nana hey hey goodbye being sung by the crowd of people

[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:03.520]
in George W Bush now once but twice yes well this wasn't the first time this goes on

[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:09.100]
Bapapapipat then second time people saying the song when he took off in the chopper it just

[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.840]
goes to show you that he will not be missed unless like governor Pialeine refuses to go away

[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:18.400]
he will not be missed that's a bulletin from this genius this rocket science just an idiot

[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.880]
as so anyway speaking of Rachel Mato the reason I read that yes is I watched the over

[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.840]
in last night and their coverage of the what happened earlier in the day and then she

[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:34.920]
comes on as usual at nine o'clock and I finally figured out who she is okay first of all

[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:43.200]
she's a guy okay secondly I'll give you a clue who she is she's guilty she is the guy

[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.500]
oh she's a guy I'm telling you she's got a voice that's squeaky she's got to wait deeper

[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:53.760]
voice than he does really well she's got a much bigger Adam's apple too yeah see she's

[00:30:53.760 --> 00:31:01.020]
guilty probably not a bigger she is a man last night while browsing msnbc.com it says there

[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.960]
were displaying comments written by people on the main page regarding the presidential

[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.100]
inauguration when I saw something that almost made me fall over my chair and is a perfect

[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:12.780]
example what tells wrong with our country somebody actually wrote I understand it's a presidential

[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.320]
inauguration but enough with the pompous celebrations it's a little much it's not like

[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:22.660]
the super bowl or anything didn't know what to think just unbelievably just just made

[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:26.900]

doing anything in 60 Jimmy Jones reached number three on the Billboard charts with a playful

[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:14.980]
song that Ballard co-wrote called Good Time and that included the lyrics who in the world

[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.920]
would have ever known what Columbus could do if Queen Isabella had an Hector Jules

[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:23.660]

crap with government it's a practice your own baby PBG be go ahead

[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.540]

[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:14.160]
you know have got a right to be alive in this country as opposed to George Herbert Walker

[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.620]
who said that atheists have no right to be Americans

[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:24.900]

[00:44:54.700 --> 00:45:01.700]
fairy this is your brain what what what what what what solid any question this is I with this new

[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:06.260]
hate days before leaving office president Bush gave a final news conference how come they didn't

[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:10.600]
connect the dots to connect the dots and all of a sudden people were saying how come you're

[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:16.320]
connecting the dots president Bush could I ask you a question John my response is

[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:22.340]
what are you talking about it's a second part of your two part question huh that was three

[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:27.440]
questions no that that was only one question yes four or five questions as hard for me to remember

[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:32.940]
every question what kind of drugs are you on that's interesting question do I have to answer

[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:38.500]
now you notice how one channel is like dropping out and then then maybe it's just a disc maybe

[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:43.260]
or maybe not be like a wire fell out you know in the back of the board somewhere a wire fell

[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.580]
out in the back of the board something who knows start jiggling stuff oh yeah

[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.760]
let me try playing that again

[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.800]
this is like with this new thing eight days before leaving office

[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:02.300]
right you can't find out how come they didn't connect the dots to connect the dots and all the

[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:06.020]
sudden people were saying how come you're connecting the double engineer president Bush

[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.640]
oh what a lunatic well at least it's not in the board because well maybe it's in that pot right

[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:19.520]
think it's in the pot smoke a little and see you you know see if you can find out what's in the

[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:25.980]
that was up seven points there's the Obama bounce oh yeah well look at all these uh

[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:33.440]
schmata heads they're in India and in Afghanistan and Pakistan you are in the sea and now there's

[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:38.400]
the anti-Christ right there is that Tony Harris idiot that skinhead on CNN he needs to be taken away

[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.220]
you need to come in and drag him off the set so speaking about that good old time religion which

[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:47.800]
we were before the break yes the Roman Catholic Church has once again revealed how in touch it is

[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:53.040]
with modern times by calling for a ban on Facebook like social networking sites

[00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:01.940]
the Italian Episcopal Conference land social networks and after opening a site of its own

[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.180]
apparently the fear is that people who use social networking sites will turn into individuals

[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:11.680]
who start to think for themselves archbishop palm pili hit out about what he called

[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:15.760]
networked individualism which he said creates people who terminate links with the surrounding

[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:20.840]
area we guess the archbishop thinks that the only people who are supposed to live in such unhealthy

[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:27.780]
isolation and live in the world but uh not of it are monks and nuns he warned that the relationships

[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:32.200]
formed online were not real well not as real as in well I guess he must be listening to this show

[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.880]
the fake this one and the fake that one well not as real in the same way as such important things

[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:41.600]
like invisible gods angels virgin birds and papal infallibility now that be real

[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:46.960]
Facebook and it's it'll create an online ego centrist and are responsible for drying up

[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:52.900]
of relationships he said although asking a celibate priest about relationships is like asking

[00:47:52.900 --> 00:48:01.720]
of vegan about the best type of meat feast pizza to buy vegan can we say vegetarian it's different

[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:07.740]
it is yeah oh there are different levels you know oh I said dumb dumb or in dumbest

[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:12.520]
the chairman of the um the titan in a physical conference bishop mariano

[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:18.860]
kosiatta said that the internet varies between elation and mistrust and it's time to find a middle

[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:23.400]
way he didn't say what the middle way was however banging on the evils of the facebook does not

[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:29.940]
strike us especially um balanced all this is ironic when the church is released its own Vatican

[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:34.340]
social networking site which is designed to stick its priests a little closer to the faithful

[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:39.180]
if the church fears people would become individuals by using social networking sites then surely

[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:44.160]
it is sending its own faithful to hell and sticking demons on its friends list how do you like that

[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:50.320]
and end the secular social network on audio people on my space and your face and Facebook and

[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:56.020]
all this other no more oh and guess what what a Catholic priest has been removed from the

[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:59.920]
ministry over an allegation essentially abused a child while serving at a Newark church in 1985

[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:05.360]
i thought it would be cute to have those two stories right together the side by each as to us

[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.440]
for that that's look at that what about

[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.760]
i'm all the way down to uh marry sure and why god does not belong to the inauguration and then i got

[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:20.940]
that uh thing about that ice cream so that means we write it's only 11 o'clock 11 o'clock

[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:28.280]
five we run we've run uh out of emails oh my god i'm gonna have to do it for three hours

[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:39.300]
i have no life i have no life i have no life i have no life i have no life i have no life i have no life

[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:43.900]
a Catholic priest has been removed from the ministry if father Fredrick Lloyd was removed from

[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:48.380]
active ministry after officials of the Roman Catholic diocese of Columbus investigated

[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:53.560]
complaint and found the abuse allegation was credible the sexual abuse allegedly occurred where

[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:58.680]
Lloyd served at St. Francis DeSales church in Newark where he was the associate pastor from 83 to 87

[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:04.500]
the church announced bishop Fredrick F Campbell removed Lloyd from ministry december 10 the church

[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:08.900]
is studying options to permanently remove him since its preliminary conclusion is not proof of guilt

[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:13.620]
the release said the church's news release said the complaint was the first specific allegation

[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:18.900]
of this nature it received about Lloyd 64 who retired from active ministry in 2006 he had been

[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:24.440]
appreased in the Columbus diocese since 1970 a message he can comment from Lloyd was left at

[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:29.720]
his Columbus home but obviously not returned church officials said they notified Newark police

[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:34.340]
of the alleged abuse however sergeant Barry Connell said officers never investigated because the age

[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:39.000]
of the case precludes prosecution of a higher law requires most felony charges be filed within six

[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:45.980]
years of the offense yeah leave the social networking sites to the priests to fathers O'Toole okay

[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.760]
so they can get together with some hot young boys

[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:56.780]

Tim says in general vegans eat no animal produced food no meat no eggs no cheese butter

[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:37.880]
whereas a vegetarian would eat any animal product that harms the animal milk eggs cheese butter

[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:47.440]

[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:37.060]
Wesley in uh Lakelands got something fairly informative fairly interesting and depressing

[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:42.960]
after 25 years with clear channel radio Gabe Hobbs status in his industry pioneer was solid

[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:49.400]
it was rock solid now to notice rock solid is our guy between one and two who's got a 1.1 share

[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:54.020]
he discovered Fox News Channel star Glenn Beck when he was spending top 40 cuts in New Haven

[00:58:54.020 --> 00:59:00.860]
Connecticut he created sports talk powerhouse WDAEM and developed WFLZ FM's classic power

[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:04.760]
peak format which has to stay to prominence in the early 90s by the way how is that what's his

[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:22.000]
at nearly 9% of its reduction some are calling the inauguration day massacre even Hobbs found he

[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:27.280]
wasn't exempt see they did this on inauguration day so it's to get as little publicity about it

[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:32.600]
as possible right but thanks to West in Lakeland we got we got the straight dope first

[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:47.020]
seemed the time to ensure the news would be drowned out by coverage of the historic presidential

[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:52.840]

[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:14.660]

[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:18.540]
doing it or whatever on it i'm saying i know nothing like you don't want to send a whole bunch of

he doesn't give a crap i can't confirm all the nice things we said about him all they ask kissing

[01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:02.560]
and all the sympathy for his making five cent now or whatever they were paying him and how they

[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:09.480]
screwed him over and nothing that's the nature of this business man people just really don't care

[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:14.060]
they put on an act when it's expedient for them but when push comes to shovel they just don't give

[01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:22.220]
a flying crap and as far as court is concerned he here's a guy that's always coming in there

[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:12.800]
calvin and he doesn't matter though because your customers are completely faced when they visit you

[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:19.180]
anyway most establishments would deny little Jimmy his alcohol and tobacco but thanks to you

[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:24.820]
he purchases a 40 and a pack of smokes with ease while his underage friends wait around the corner

[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:32.420]
sure the cops have tried to shut you down but you provide a public service keeping businesses that

[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:39.260]
would otherwise go belly up in the black out so we salute you mr fake id maker your inkjet

[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:44.660]
predator your three x-wives and the scores of hungover teenagers who couldn't get up for school today

[01:06:55.160 --> 01:07:00.940]
have to be a bunch like these every day with emails every single day mr. Rogers i must say

[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:05.860]
that i'm beginning to become concerned for your mental health yesterday afternoon you read an email

[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:09.560]
detailing how you would lost your edge since moving your shoulder Toronto with which i vigorously

[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:14.280]
agree it was a very perspicacious observation and especially since this is the person who sent it i'm

[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:19.440]
sure the first one came from Jimmy syphilite so there are two different ones you read it as though

[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:23.560]
with the first time was going on here claiming that it came in on friday night the reality though

[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:28.940]
is that you would already read the same email on friday now do you recall that my reading the same one

[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:39.500]
you do oh when you do understand this what and that is that a lot of these people send the same email

[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:43.620]
twice three times four times right even after i do read it on the year right

[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:49.100]
and reality though was that you what that crap happens all the time sometimes we'll play the same

[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:53.500]
bit twice uh you know who gives a rat's ass the reality was you already read that same email on

[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.720]
friday early on the show yesterday you claimed you had only heard a total of George doing radio

[01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:00.300]
for a couple of minutes this contradicted your earlier statements in the summer when you

[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:04.360]
recounted how you listen to George doing the show and discussed in detail his show topic i don't

[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:08.780]
remember that i don't remember that because i don't listen i don't listen to the radio period

[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.860]
i certainly hope that the gloom of seasonal effect of this order said is not getting you

[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:20.240]
or something or something worse no maybe just these idiotic emails are getting me it is sad oh it

[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:28.640]
so freaking sad oh god sad doesn't even come close to describing it oh you're losing it old man

[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:34.260]
you're losing it in addition to which there's so many of them that are similar there was a follow-up

[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:38.280]
to that Jimmy syphilis saying well i agree with that email or any audio to audio and since you

[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:43.480]
were moved into rano and blah blah blah all this other crap guess what i don't give a crap how do

[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:49.580]
you like that i couldn't give a flying crap bless but if you want if you've got that much time

[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:53.980]

[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:23.200]
a sports talk star war for nearly 20 years who also serve as the timber wolves play by plan

[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:28.680]

[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:34.920]
housing and i also wonder if he likes to do it doogie style if we weren't facing this economic

[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.740]
tsunami and this came out of nowhere and multiple people weren't let go it would be a bigger

[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:43.040]
surprise that heartman still it's difficult when you're an individual who has to deal with it he

[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:48.380]
was given the news around the same time obama was being sworn in oh yeah so obvious so transparent

[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:15.140]
spot clear channel employees were braced for a rough day the san antonia based company which

[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:19.580]
operates more than 1200 radio stations was expected permits workforce by seven percent

[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:24.500]
but two two two days cuts were worse than expected eighteen hundred and fifty workers lost

[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:29.220]

[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:22.240]
couldn't figure out that's true but we liked him a lot and he said good good people are the dead people

[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:27.000]
squirt squirt there are some who believe clear channel communications timed as long and

[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.760]
anticipated company wide elimination about 1850 jobs to coincide with the oba no which is this

[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:38.680]
from i don't know what this is from i hate when they do that oh this is from the Chicago trip

[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:43.740]
but nothing about what happened in South Florida with cheap channel yet peri jackass

[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:49.080]
where's our sources where's our informers well clear channel actually did with it's this

[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:52.920]
missiles and a bit of cut of reported for a million dollar in cost including the unsurmonious

[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:58.640]
ouster of w and u a fm 95.5 hedren ricco del was to punctuate a moment in history

[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.320]
oba is an algorithmic arrest call the weakened economy a consequence of greed and irresponsibility

[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.680]
on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and per peri

[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:12.960]
donation for a new age one might say the same on the situation at clear channel where cuts

[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:18.500]
expected since before being capital partners and tomis hley partners last year closed at 17.9

[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:22.240]
billion dollar deal to take the company private likely became more severe as a result of the

[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:27.540]
economic downturn what is left is emblematic of a company and industry leads it for a decade or so

[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:32.040]
believe resulting efficiencies would more than pay for consolidation and when financial projections

[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.480]
go short after stations lost their individuality and edge in the marketplace came to realize more

[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:43.860]
cuts and sacrifices would be required just last summer Earl Jones clear channels president

[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:52.480]

[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:29.320]
Steve ziggler used to hide that big screwdriver oh yeah make no mistake about that the wonder it was

[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:34.380]
warm never forget today when steves ziggler came in and took that bad hair piece off his head and

[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:39.520]
heaved it at me and i gave him like a gigantic sitting ovation should have kept it

[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:44.540]
and done well with it could it could have had to hang out with from moe could have nailed it to

[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:49.280]
the wall like it's a scalp and maybe would have like moved around a little bit maybe or a lot

[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:54.420]
he used it as a warmer why do guys in fact there's a guy a woodbind guy like maybe seven years

[01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:01.460]
has a piece that makes mose look like art that's how bad it is and there was a lady playing next to

[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:06.700]
me the other day and she said he was like a few machines down and she said why would anybody walk

[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:13.320]
out of the house looking like that yeah and i thought to myself that's a good question i still wonder

[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:18.380]
why i don't know i guess maybe i said maybe he doesn't have any mirrors in the house and she chuckled

[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:26.560]
you know like that maybe he's a vampire can't see his reflection oh my god a piece so ridiculous

[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:33.120]
so silly and so fake and so obvious like mose used to be like a muskrat died on his head

[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:39.040]
peat and tapas says gay beehob's once presided over wfla which was once its

[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:43.980]
manifestation when it had people like last year lionel and christ Thomas he obviously doesn't

[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:48.820]
care about being fair and balanced even having a decent product as wfla is now a virtual paid political

[01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:55.400]
announcement for the republican party sounds like iod and my any jimmy syphilis and glendreck

[01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:00.180]
and rush limbaugh and the time and smitmeister and all his other Nazis they got on the year and

[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:05.040]
that's because that's what cheap channels really all about peddling fascism in the last few months

[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:09.440]
he has fired the two voices of reason who actually did live shows me renappa mark bero and

[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:14.300]
daniel rooth says peat and tapas well thanks for the bad news peat that's cheap channel for you a

[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:19.900]
bunch of butchers and murderers we finally got a little something something here relating to florida

[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:37.380]
john cleary channel mean it asks this is from the orlando sentinel my radio sources tell me

[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:41.640]
this is by written by might be anky i wonder if he's kid albie ac he used to play for the syracuse

[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:47.460]
nats in the nva my radio sources tell me means every major market in the state might soon be all

[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:53.020]
silio all the time local sports radio host dan silio who already samukas is morning drive time

[01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:57.480]
radio show in tampa and orlando is on in jackson vise of this morning and there's talking maybe

[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:10.640]
syphilis in jacksonville he replaced popular long time host david lamb and his co-host joe coward

[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:16.220]
at nine thirty a.m. the city's most established sports station nine thirty a.m. full disclosure i

[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:19.480]
do a morning radio show nine or eleven a.m. with co-host marked anil's on ten eighty a.m.

[01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:23.200]
not a clear channel station so i guess you can call me competitive silio is all of his show

[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:28.800]
is on a different time slot six to nine a.m. honestly though i don't consider us to be competitors on my

[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:33.280]
sports talk junkie i listen to sports talk no matter what station it's on i've listened to silio

[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:38.560]
since he arrived in orlando five or six years ago frankly i don't like where local sports is

[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:42.480]
headed with clear channel essentially cutting costs to samukas syndicate it shows into all their

[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:47.160]
major markets for instance i like silio when he talks about sports orlando is interested in the

[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:51.140]
magic the gator seven oles night's nfl but we don't get nearly enough of those topics in orlando

[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:55.300]
because he's often talking about the books the raise and the lightning snooze because he has to

[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:58.980]
please his larger Tampa market what's it going to be like now that he's in jacksonville in my

[01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:04.340]
army do we really want influx of jaguars heat and marlins talk at our local our waves the marlins

[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:09.420]
the other news coming out of clear channels cusses that seven forty a.m. a soon be dropping its

[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:13.020]
Latin format and going back to an all sports format with line of that includes silio in a

[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:17.660]
morning followed by syndicated programming dan patrick and jim roam with a chance that the legendary

[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:22.980]

the gentleman's very effective spokesperson for the for the company but uh...

[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:36.020]

right

[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:37.920]

uh... well i don't want to build a millum clearly putting a mission

[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:05.480]
accomplished on a aircraft here was a mistake

[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:09.820]
for some people predicting a bomb would be held every by twenty points

[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:14.120]
ten double digits okay

[01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:17.180]

was a very large earthquake

[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:34.340]
the good thing is

[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.120]
there were no immediate reports

[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:37.260]
many differences

[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:38.820]
for injuries

[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:39.740]

[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:36.640]
supporting what say the critics believe that you're ignoring the advice of

as if as if we needed any confirmation of that

[01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:21.780]
that's like that's like saying to the people on the Titanic oh and guess what

[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:22.620]
we're going down

[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:30.020]
Lisa Skolnik-Kolvin says is this hit real

[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:37.100]
what does that mean i don't know oh it's got a link to something i don't know

[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:40.200]
and i don't care and i'm uh... deleting it right now is this link real

[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:46.420]
the inauguration day massacre is what they're calling it in the tampa

[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:49.860]
and all over the country is teepe channel cuts eighteen hundred and fifty

[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:51.080]
jobs nationwide

[01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:56.780]
so if that's the case if that's really true what we just had on there

[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:00.740]
about the uh... clear channel moves which have been hearing a lot of rumors about

[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:06.660]
that for a long time that means Jimmy syphilite out of work all the rest of

[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.920]
the stuff they got on their syndicated you know limbaugh and

[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:15.600]
shmit back it's all syndicated direct right the only local jokalika on their

[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:18.440]
jimmy syphilite the more i don't think he's gonna be around to be on liberal

[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:22.020]
talk radio you know i'm saying after his fascist rants of the last few months

[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:26.120]
that he's been on bye bye jimmy i don't have any emails from jimmy today saying oh

[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:27.140]
gee it's yours been fun

[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:31.300]
and we're getting the pink slips over here at teepe channel

[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:36.580]
always taking all these shots at me and you in this station and the audience

[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:38.900]
which believe me we deserve plenty but nevertheless

[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:43.840]
look in the mirror jimmy your days are numbered and i think probably in single

[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:44.320]
digits

[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:49.240]
and what that be great in all sports station with a morning show coming out of

[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:52.380]
orlando that should be very atopical shouldn't oh yeah

[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:56.000]
so how many sports stations is that mean we got to market now

[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.180]
very ought to be happy about that because he told us years ago if we just had

[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:02.980]
a hundred sports talk stations it would bring a lot more people to sports talk

[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:07.980]
right and divide the audience up by a hundred uh... times maybe that's how we

[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:11.200]
got to that point at night nine o'clock

[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.400]
grandin says here's your bubba spy report i can't stand bubba he's a lot like

[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:19.740]
howard in the fact that he goes way over as a lot of times show slot ten forty

[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:23.780]
and he was still on name dropping left and right how do you like that see you get

[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:27.340]
suckered in because he keeps kissing my ass and kissing up to me but the fact of

trace it i mean do they sound okay on the year yeah well you know it gets

[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:40.060]
monitored out by the time it gets here but probably we're missing something

[01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:42.360]
how do we know what we're missing because we're not hearing it

[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:46.100]
we're you're not missing nothing but all right trust me in this place you're

[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:47.360]
missing something boy you're dreaming

[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:54.060]
anyway Lisa emails back says hi again sir i didn't flesh out my question

[01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:57.780]
better but i said it during the katey crewer bit i was asking if that was really

[01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:00.680]
her or a bit i have no links on my page

[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:08.960]
well that is really her Lisa that's her she's a simple didn't a moron and a

[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:11.980]
bubblehead and those are real outtakes from various crap

[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:16.500]
which chicken neck worked his ass off i'm not like in fact it was so good i

[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:20.360]
think we ought to play it again i agree five or ten times i agree

[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:24.760]
who you think and who are those people arguing i used to be your boss and

[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:29.200]
no no who are those people because that was funny that was the fun i don't know

[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:34.800]
i have no idea chicken up on that why yeah chicken i'll tell you who given the

[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.920]
astray poop here's one that's got a bunch of comments about dan

[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:41.940]
sillio it seems to me i could be wrong but i remember the name

[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:46.940]
wasn't he once upon a time on a year in this market like on fox sports radio or

[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:50.420]
one of those incarnations it sounds familiar yeah my brain tuned that out which

[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:54.180]
means probably that's what it was i'm pretty positive he was on one of these

[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:57.280]
incarnations of sports talk radio the 80,000 we've had in the last

[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:00.920]
several years went over like a pregnant pole of alter in the middle of

[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:06.380]
july at the equator not good here are some comments and i don't know where

[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:08.900]
these are from mama be i don't know where these comments are from

[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:12.760]
it's very sad it says very little about the quality of sports talk radio in

[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:16.220]
a book full like dan sillio can go stay wide he's either dirt cheap or the

[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:18.800]
sports talk audience in the state are a bunch of mental midgets

[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:23.260]
sillio comes at a lower asking price than other syndicated talk show host the

[01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:26.880]
reasons why are blatantly obvious it's cheaper to be even pay one guy across

[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:29.520]
several markets than to pay several guys to focus on one market

[01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:35.600]
a mfm our dead technology anyway it says try podcast your satellite radio

[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:38.660]
so many more choices and let me say it again as far as satellite radio is

[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:42.740]
concerned uh... serious is ten cents but you should know that that's not the

[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:48.380]
lowest point right no it's not they reached eight cents a few weeks ago

[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:53.120]
because you can see the high and low the last 52 weeks eight cents

[01:42:54.020 --> 01:42:57.440]
then they went zooming back up to sixteen seventeen cent and now they're

[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:01.120]
sliding back to a nice comfortable dime got a dime you can buy a share of

[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:06.760]
serious i'm cereal you want some please some buying opportunity man that's

[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:10.400]
what maria would tell you how's the market's doing

[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:14.680]
another reason why not to watch cnn they put the number in the bottom right hand

[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:18.200]
corner in such tiny print now you you couldn't read that if you had like

[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:24.200]
a hundred hundred vision you turn over to msnbc though where the hell is it

[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:28.460]
and they got it there the s and p is up ten and a half points police investigating

[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:30.600]
unknown white substance of the wall street urinal

[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:38.060]
that's the breaking news that were found that contestant which is of course

[01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:41.800]
based in the thousand seventy six and a half point i'd find out more details about

[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:44.780]
what's happening there at the wall street journal we will pass those along quick

[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:48.900]
break here we'll be right back okay good police are investigating an unknown

[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:54.260]
white substance at the wall street urinal that right right wing rack maybe the

[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:56.660]
liberals are getting even with all your right wingers now that would be good

[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:03.940]
uh... take a powder maybe it's bc powder is there anybody except red

[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:08.640]

i'm dying out of here it's good i love doctor pepper

[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:41.380]
although then like i said they do not make i think there should be a law for

[01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:42.280]
those of us fat people

[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.620]
and since the majority of people are overweight or fat or obese

[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:50.980]
there ought to be a law made by the FDA and here as well

[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:58.860]
that any beverage that's produced with sugar is also made in sugar free and

[01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:04.080]
caffeine and sugar free you know like caffeine free dye Pepsi caffeine free

[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:08.380]
dye coke like that correct am i right yes there should be a freaking lot of

[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:11.080]
protect those of us who don't want to you know i'll take my sugar and ice cream

[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:14.400]

blueberry had blueberry pie in a while no not lately i have i just love blueberries

[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:29.660]
Roberto Benignio Campos thought there ought to be a law for kicking a man out of the

[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:32.180]
bar closing time police said in Tampa they got real

[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:35.820]

gentleman's oasis scooped up his drink at 3.50 a.m. to shut down for the night

compost called 9.11 to say he'd been robbed in affidavit says

Tampa police were not amused officers arrived at the bikini bar 2310 north

[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:15.340]
police were glad to help compost to jail police charge him with misdemeanor

[01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:18.140]
misuse of the 9.11 system for calling emergency number for a purpose

[01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:20.200]

that is slightly disturbing

[01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:15.420]
can help with thinking that this thing a little more tight

[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:18.180]

you know here's one that says Neil the bastard said on the show that he went

[01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:06.700]
on the jam cruise last week and had so much fun

[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:09.680]
that if not for his job at seven ninety would have just stayed on the ship till

[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:13.580]
his money ran out seeing that he's all that seven ninety has left i think w

[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:16.900]

time on their hands who don't realize there's a knob on the radio it allows them

[01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:47.860]
to change the station if they don't like what they hear but they won't do that

[01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:50.960]
because they're probably the same people who snobbishly email you about food

[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:55.020]

[01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:44.440]
agreement with a spared skihand prison time and allowed him to return to his home in Ireland

client are wrong you said the money went to employ bonuses building improvements and other

[01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:41.440]
explainable expenses like maybe getting laid and stuff we can certainly account for most of it

[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:47.560]
Barlow said the case of the two Irish born priest is drawn international attention and other scandals

[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:52.180]

into Obama he said he was gonna he wasn't gonna bring notes he wasn't gonna bring it written out

[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:42.980]
he was gonna do it from the top of his head the chief justice of the Supreme Court and he screwed it

[01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:49.560]
up and Obama looked at him and paused like what's up judge you like an on drugs or something my god

[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:55.780]

[02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:16.080]

[02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:34.880]
yeah Eddie says I just wanted to vent and say we're finally rid of that bumbling idiot

[02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:40.740]
I've been a big supporter of Obama hope he lives up to most of the expectations we have for him

[02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:43.460]
we should all realize there's no way he'll please us all all the time

[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:49.380]
however there are so many serious issues we need uh need to be addressed that have been swept

[02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:54.060]
under the rug not just by the past administration but for generations in other words there are

[02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:58.360]
a bunch of crooks Eddie there are brunch are crooks rape the public that's the game that they play

[02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:02.420]
the oil companies all the other big corporations rape the public and the politicians got their hand

[02:06:02.420 --> 02:06:08.220]
in the cookie jar too like uh rod blagoia which who put the oil he put the gory in blagoia which

[02:06:09.220 --> 02:06:13.100]
we as a people need to stay on top of our elected officials I don't want to stay on top of any of them

[02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:16.940]
and demand that there be intellectual discussions and not just the partisan politics

[02:06:16.940 --> 02:06:20.820]
that have put us where we are today intellectual discussions like when George is on doing the show

[02:06:21.780 --> 02:06:26.580]
yeah I don't believe all our problems will be solved by Obama well thank god for that but I do uh

[02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:30.060]
oh you said thank god yeah I was talking about thank damn god

[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:36.440]
but I hope he begins to clean up the mess of the past eight years a lawyer listener since 88 Eddie

[02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:39.380]
thank you Eddie Eddie says it's a new beginning right

[02:06:40.540 --> 02:06:45.820]
it was pretty amazing day yesterday and then of course Teddy screwed it all up by eating that duck

[02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:50.080]
I never had duck and I have no desire to have it because everybody tells me it's real

[02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:55.400]
gamey tasting and real ultra greasy and you have to cook it like medium rare because otherwise

[02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:59.860]
it gets real rubbery I didn't hear that part but that's what I was told it's a dark meat all

[02:06:59.860 --> 02:07:06.340]
the way through oh I don't like dark meat and it is greasy oh I like the white chicken breast

[02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:12.220]
on the chicken so I heard thanks for reading my email says Rudy Panera's bread is a great place

[02:07:12.220 --> 02:07:18.560]
they offer free free Wi-Fi plus they also donate all their leftover pastries and bread the

[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:22.720]
local charities that can collect it it's great for the people receiving every Saturday my local charity

[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.600]
well whatever that means do you understand what that means nope I don't either in other words if

[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:34.040]
you get it if you're starving to death and you get it at the uh committals house maybe it's okay

[02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:42.440]
boy talk about a long email from Jim and England oh my god Jim even the British have no life

[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:47.480]
I wonder how the queen is doing I heard the queen had a magnificent ball movement this morning a royal ball

[02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:13.960]
lalalala so should lick him like a lolly lalalala maybe next time I'll just whack some

[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:18.980]
as they go back I'll have just scratch them

[02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:31.720]
lalalala one o'clock at 560 w.w.qu.m. oh it's so cold Neil it's so cold down here well too bad

[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:36.100]
yeah whatever temperature you got I'll trade you for it how's that cold we almost had to open the

[02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:40.240]
windows yeah Brandon says La Carrera tab blows big time

[02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:46.020]
well Las Vegas is great especially the one in Hollywood which haven't going too since I was

[02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:46.960]
is born like what?

[02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:49.220]
Chipotle is a good place for some huge good burritos.

[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:55.180]
Everybody likes a big huge burrito and some people even like a big huge chalupa.

[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:56.020]
Sure.

[02:08:57.120 --> 02:08:58.340]
Chipotle, you know that place?

[02:08:58.800 --> 02:08:59.260]
Never heard of it.

[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:00.280]
No, well there you go.

[02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:01.100]
I'll check it out.

[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:02.940]
Because so far he's right on.

[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:04.120]
I mean I was trying to be nice.

[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:05.940]
Why he got to be nice?

[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:06.760]
But look at Rita.

[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.420]
They're not spending any money on this station.

[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:08.960]
Are you kidding me?

[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.920]
La Carreta is going to buy his time on this station.

[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:11.540]
I'll be overrated.

[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:12.500]
La Carreta?

[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:14.840]
See, I do know where the one is in the airport though.

[02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:15.740]
I've seen it.

[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:17.660]
In Miami Airport.

[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:24.460]
Well, they should could use some better food joints in the Fort Lauderdale while in Terminal 2 is where I go now, here in Canada.

[02:09:26.060 --> 02:09:27.340]
And Terminal 4 has got like one.

[02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:30.240]
They got one food place and everybody lines up like 600 deep.

[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:34.340]
What a stupid bunch of asses they are at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport.

[02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:36.160]
What a stupid asses run in that place.

[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:37.240]
God.

[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:39.200]
And they've got that Terminal 4.

[02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:41.480]
Talk about not ready for prime time.

[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:43.840]
They've got 700 different flights out of the same Terminal.

[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:45.140]
It's about the size of a shoe box.

[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:48.080]
Don't you hate that?

[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:49.020]
Yep.

[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:50.100]
And I'll tell you what else I hate.

[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:52.660]
And even in Terminal 2 and Fort Lauderdale, there aren't enough seats.

[02:09:53.380 --> 02:09:54.360]
There aren't enough seats.

[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:56.940]
They've got to flight that seats like 300 people.

[02:09:57.020 --> 02:09:57.980]
And they've got like 60 seats.

[02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:01.020]
And then they've got a whole bunch of seats.

[02:10:01.020 --> 02:10:02.440]
They're like a half a mile away, you know.

[02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:10.160]
But nevertheless, I still think the idea is to if they had good places where you can get fast food and airports.

[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:12.120]
And then carry it on the plane.

[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:13.480]
What a great idea.

[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:15.080]
And say no thanks for that crap food.

[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:17.120]
You're going to give me even in business class or first class.

[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:18.920]
Take your crap food and shove it.

[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:20.300]
God.

[02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:26.780]
I mean, once upon a time way back in the day, I used to get really great food in Allatine in a business class.

[02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:30.800]
And then of course, they damn near went under and they became something else.

[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:32.160]
And last time I flew them.

[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:34.180]
Was it last year?

[02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:35.120]
I think I flew allatine.

[02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:35.720]
I'm not really sure.

[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:36.100]
I don't know.

[02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:38.300]
But it was crapola.

[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:38.960]
Very mediocre.

[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:47.600]
You know, either be an airline and fly people from one place to another or be a restaurant.

[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:49.200]
It's very hard to do both.

[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:50.360]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:50.640]
Yeah.

[02:10:51.300 --> 02:10:53.160]
You just have a vending machine there at the end of the aisle.

[02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:55.320]
If you want to know.

[02:10:55.380 --> 02:11:00.700]
And in fact, there are times on scare Canada when I'm tempted, you know, in in schlepper class and then coach.

[02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:08.120]
They have a menu in the back of the airline booklet, you know, that they have in front of the seat in front of you.

[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:10.120]
In the magazine.

[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:15.980]
And the back of the magazine, they got a bunch of like sub sandwiches and different things you can purchase for an extra two or three, four bucks, whatever.

[02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:18.200]
And I'm almost, I'm tempted.

[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:19.880]
I mean, I guess I'd feel foolish.

[02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:23.660]
But I'm tempted to say, hey, I'll pass on your meal, whatever you're serving us.

[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:26.060]
That's included in the $8 million fair.

[02:11:26.340 --> 02:11:27.920]
And I'll get me a sub sandwich.

[02:11:29.060 --> 02:11:32.880]
Even sub boys starting to look pretty good compared to the swirlet they serve on those flights.

[02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:39.680]
You want the chicken or the salmon or the trouser trout or you want the, oh my god.

[02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:41.540]
And the tilapia.

[02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:42.780]
Well, what is with tilapia?

[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:43.480]
I don't know.

[02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:45.100]
It's just another fish, ain't it?

[02:11:45.820 --> 02:11:47.500]
Yeah, but not all fish are created equal.

[02:11:47.580 --> 02:11:48.540]
No, I know that.

[02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:54.720]
But my whole life I went, I never heard of tilapia and then all of a sudden the last few years, everybody's screaming and there's even a movie about tilapia.

[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:56.400]
You ever hear about John Dory?

[02:11:57.560 --> 02:11:59.160]
Jim Dory played for the Leafsboy.

[02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:00.320]
He was one hot looking guy.

[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:01.120]
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:02.120]
That guy will get upset again.

[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:04.440]
The guy who doesn't listen because the show isn't for him.

[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:05.820]
But he tolerates fags.

[02:12:06.580 --> 02:12:07.180]
That guy.

[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:07.760]
Eddie.

[02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:10.580]
Jim says,

[02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:15.140]
John Roberts and how useful the stories on your website turn out to be.

[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:16.620]
Yet two bad more people don't read them.

[02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:24.200]
I would say the average story that we put on our website, which I'm assuming court is still doing and I'm assuming, we get about 200 reads.

[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:27.240]
Now that's not very impressive, is it?

[02:12:28.780 --> 02:12:29.680]
No, not really.

[02:12:30.380 --> 02:12:34.420]
Like today, it's time to stop being afraid of the notorious GOP.

[02:12:34.860 --> 02:12:36.440]
99 people are read that so far.

[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:39.140]
Yesterday, George W. Bush, we will never forget.

[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:40.560]
That's got 278.

[02:12:42.980 --> 02:12:46.320]
The day before Bush's only gift to America, that's got 205.

[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:52.500]
The day before Bush supported US attorneys and refused to leave justice to barmer 201.

[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.180]
Was King James Gay, 178.

[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:57.320]
That was the day before.

[02:12:57.860 --> 02:13:00.300]
Palin, the press and her pregnancy, 228.

[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:01.780]
That was on January 16.

[02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:07.080]
I mean, if you go back a while, over a period of time, they build up and there's something like, you know, a few hundred.

[02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:11.220]
If you go away back, I mean, once upon a time, oh, here's one.

[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:14.560]
January of November 11th.

[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:17.900]
But that's the right after the election, 309, 304.

[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:19.420]
See, if you go by the accumulates.

[02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:24.220]
But do you think it's really worth putting those bedtime stories on there?

[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:26.080]
That I can't answer, you know?

[02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:29.060]
I mean, it's a labor of love, obviously.

[02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:30.600]
A labor of love by whom?

[02:13:31.620 --> 02:13:31.960]
To you?

[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:32.600]
By me?

[02:13:33.060 --> 02:13:34.240]
See, it's one of those things.

[02:13:34.420 --> 02:13:34.940]
It's not my usual.

[02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:39.500]
It's like trying to get your kid to eat nutritious food, as opposed to junk food or crap.

[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:41.520]
They're not going to eat the nutritious food.

[02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:44.280]
They're not going to eat the nutritious food.

[02:13:44.500 --> 02:13:46.140]
So what's the way to make the suck?

[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:48.140]
What human restaurant in Miami is good?

[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:49.240]
Las Vegas?

[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:50.520]
Oh, in Miami, I don't know.

[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:52.320]
Las Vegas is all up in Broward, as far as I know.

[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:55.280]
Oh, well, let's find out from somebody a good Cuban restaurant in Miami.

[02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:59.460]
And it's obviously not Carreta, because Mary and everybody in Brandon, everybody said it sucks.

[02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:01.400]
Brandon is spot on, by the way, about that location.

[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:02.540]
Spot on, Brandon.

[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:07.580]
Brandon knows his crab, which he said, Bubba loves fun.

[02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:09.000]
That show his crab, too, is what he said.

[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:13.640]
Rich, the atheist in Orlando says, Panera bread is a quick casual restaurant that's been very successful.

[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:18.800]
The largest operator in Florida was a 40-something storm McDonald's operator in Ohio.

[02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:22.580]
It focuses on breads and other starches, which would kill a diabetic.

[02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:23.240]
No thanks.

[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:26.320]
It's one of the chains that we pour goi in with mystery shop.

[02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:29.280]
The quality is not as good as five guys, but pretty darn good.

[02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:30.200]
Now, wait a minute.

[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:32.400]
I thought five guys was a burger joint.

[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:33.400]
Yeah.

[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:35.460]
So what does that got to do with a bread joint?

[02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:36.080]
I don't know.

[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:39.680]
Also, I heard your micrineried drop a while back.

[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:41.600]
Didn't this voice vaguely resemble that of Johnny Most?

[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:43.480]
The ultimate homemer for the Boston soldier said,

[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:44.440]
We was robbed.

[02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:45.160]
No, it did not.

[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:47.000]
He didn't say anything at all like we're Johnny Most.

[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.860]
Says Rich, the atheist in Orlando, is otherwise a good guy, but he don't know his Johnny Most.

[02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:54.800]
We was robbed having a text all about.

[02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:57.480]
He had a raspy, high-pitched voice.

[02:14:57.900 --> 02:14:59.200]
Nothing at all like micrineried.

[02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:02.060]
You want to play that drop again?

[02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:03.260]
I'm getting a little tired of that crap.

[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:05.160]
I'm getting a little tired of that crap.

[02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:06.220]
I can tell you right now.

[02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:07.520]
Then that sound just like Johnny Most?

[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:07.920]
No.

[02:15:08.380 --> 02:15:08.380]

[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:09.060]
No.

[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:14.580]
Oh, wait, B-Lock.

[02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:15.620]
Nice going by the Panthers.

[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:18.000]
Panthers haven't a good season by the way they got a shot at the playoffs.

[02:15:18.700 --> 02:15:20.800]
If they picked up, wait, B-Lock, a real stiff.

[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:22.040]
I could have told him about that.

[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:25.420]
And Chad Kilder, who never played a single game there.

[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:27.440]
But nevertheless, what do I know?

[02:15:30.300 --> 02:15:31.640]
We love the Panthers.

[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:32.440]
They're doing good.

[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:33.620]
They haven't a good season.

[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:34.280]
Nobody cares.

[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:35.080]
That's a sad part.

[02:15:36.180 --> 02:15:38.780]
I guess there were about 11,000 people there for the Savers game.

[02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:40.820]
The other night and about 3,000 of them were Savers fans.

[02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:41.700]
That's not good.

[02:15:42.740 --> 02:15:43.940]
240 votes on the pool.

[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:44.800]
They liked my opinion.

[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:45.720]
And you were somewhat too.

[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:47.920]
Of course, you're the intellectual guy.

[02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:48.240]
Right.

[02:15:48.380 --> 02:15:48.460]
Yeah.

[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:50.320]
Here's one about Las Vegas.

[02:15:51.580 --> 02:15:55.680]
Ray says Las Vegas has several soft-load of restaurants including two in Pembroke Pines.

[02:15:56.020 --> 02:15:59.660]
For some reason, the one in East Pines, Paman Pines,

[02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:00.900]
leaves something to be desired.

[02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:02.420]
But the one in West Pines is excellent.

[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:05.240]
I'm eating Picadillo from there right now, says Ray.

[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:06.440]
How do you like that?

[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:06.920]
Picadillo.

[02:16:07.620 --> 02:16:08.020]
Picadillo?

[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:08.920]
Picadillo.

[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:09.540]
Yeah.

[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:10.640]
Picarillo.

[02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:13.580]
Picadillo?

[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:14.660]
What is Picadillo?

[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:15.020]
Grombi.

[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:18.460]
I mean, they put stuff in it like, you know, diced onions and things like that.

[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:18.840]
Mmm.

[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:21.580]
That sounds like it's right up my alley, Sally.

[02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:25.120]
Grombi with onions and maybe shrooms too would be good.

[02:16:26.580 --> 02:16:29.380]
Sounds better than those crappy Mexican meals I had was forceful.

[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:30.460]
Oh, sorry about that.

[02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:33.820]
You know, you got me curious now about real Mexican food.

[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:36.900]
Well, just because that family happens to be rising cooks doesn't mean many people.

[02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:38.560]
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm thinking.

[02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:39.600]
I would like a second opinion.

[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:41.760]
I mean, I was already told by Paco that mama, mama,

[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:43.520]
mama Sita couldn't cook her way out of her paper set.

[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:44.540]
That sounds like my mom.

[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:51.320]
Now, my mom in her earlier days, the first 400 years of her life, she was a pretty good cook.

[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:56.840]
She could cook up like stuffed cabbage and meatloaf and, I mean, really good stuff.

[02:16:57.080 --> 02:16:58.080]
And pinwheel cookies.

[02:16:58.260 --> 02:16:59.480]
Did your mom ever make pinwheel cookies?

[02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:02.180]
My mom never made anything that you could choke down.

[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:04.440]
Dogs turn their nose up at anything, my mother.

[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:04.760]
Really?

[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:06.540]
But you know what pinwheel cookies are?

[02:17:06.620 --> 02:17:08.240]
Yeah, that's going to my mom bait something.

[02:17:08.820 --> 02:17:09.900]
What a ridiculous notion.

[02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:13.660]
And also a toll house cookie she used to call them, which don't we call those chocolate chip cookies?

[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:15.120]
But she called them toll house cookies.

[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:17.140]
Yeah, I don't know what the distinction is, but yes.

[02:17:18.020 --> 02:17:19.040]
Well, there must be a distinction.

[02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:26.720]
Anyway, this, Jim says, I was on Google trying to remind myself of John Roberts' involvement in the 2000s stolen election.

[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:30.800]
One of the top links that came up with this article in the news archives on neo-rojers.com.

[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:32.200]
Our Mark Caputo.

[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:37.400]
Supreme Court nominee John Roberts had a larger 2000 recon role than previously reported.

[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:41.280]
And it goes on about how they recruited him to come in and help them fix the election.

[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:49.260]
Ted Cruz, domestic policy advisor for President Bush and was now a Texas solicitor general.

[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:55.840]
Said Roberts was one of the first names he thought of while he in another attorney drafted the Republican legal dream team of litigation lines.

[02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:59.220]
800 pound gorillas, which ultimately consisted of 400 attorneys in Florida.

[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:01.520]
Who came down and knocked on the doors.

[02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:06.120]
Why not say and let and help fix the 2000 election and are responsible able to be on death row.

[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:11.180]
For the 4200 dead American soldiers and hundreds of thousands of dead Iraqis.

[02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:12.400]
Now the other dead people as well.

[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:15.960]
Who died in that fake war fake rac attack.

[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:20.800]
So I bet you were going to get like lots of hope.

[02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:21.940]
Maybe we won't.

[02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:26.160]
Oh, here's what about Talapea.

[02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:30.320]
There was a segment on discoveries dirty jobs that made me swear off Talapea.

[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:35.320]
Fish farms that raised trout used to lap you to consume the poop that the trout produced.

[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:38.140]
Then they sell the Talapea for human consumption.

[02:18:38.580 --> 02:18:43.180]
Of course, we if we knew how all food was produced, the only thing we wanted to chew on was the end of a gun barrel.

[02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:46.640]
Kid says Nick. Thanks Nick. Good point.

[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:48.940]
Next got a point.

[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:54.940]
Neil the best airline and best food by far is Swiss trites.

[02:18:55.740 --> 02:18:57.580]
They fly to Miami, but probably not Toronto.

[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.280]
Also the terminal Miami that air Canada flies from is magnificent.

[02:19:01.780 --> 02:19:04.760]
I'll let's stick with four Lottardale. Thank you.

[02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:11.380]
Oh, Jimmy Dorsky is back with a tell the food.

[02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:12.940]
Now that chipotle is owned by McDonald's.

[02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:14.480]
So what's wrong with that?

[02:19:15.260 --> 02:19:15.960]
Nothing so far.

[02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:18.980]
I guess Jimmy has now that new anus burger with bacon and cheddar.

[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:21.860]
I had one a couple days ago. It's damn good. I like it.

[02:19:22.860 --> 02:19:24.020]
I like it a lot.

[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:28.880]
The fake Larry King is back. Mike Winnery was a good guy, but he sounded like a Yahoo.

[02:19:29.140 --> 02:19:30.880]
I loved when he had Roger pull the plug.

[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:32.780]
What does that mean?

[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:38.040]
I don't know. Doesn't sound like Roger pulled the plug on what his pacemaker he didn't have on.

[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:41.240]
That rich had a pacemaker and guess what?

[02:19:41.660 --> 02:19:42.860]
He died. That's correct.

[02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:45.000]
Neil Rogers.

[02:19:45.140 --> 02:19:45.300]
I.

[02:19:45.660 --> 02:19:48.640]
My fellow Americans, this is your outgoing president.

[02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:53.200]
I know many of you saw the footage of me dodging shoes thrown at me in Iraq.

[02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:55.620]
And some of you were worried about my safety.

[02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:59.160]
By some of you, I mean my family except for Jim.

[02:19:59.680 --> 02:20:00.820]
He's always been jealous of me.

[02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:04.040]
Well, I want you to know that wasn't really an attack.

[02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:07.360]
It was a promotional stunt for my new job.

[02:20:07.820 --> 02:20:10.020]
That's right, America. After I leave office.

[02:20:10.860 --> 02:20:16.140]
George W. Bush will be the new assistant manager at footballer, Channel Demole.

[02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:20.480]
Where right now, knockies are 10% off just in time for Christmas.

[02:20:21.380 --> 02:20:22.300]
God bless America.

[02:20:22.720 --> 02:20:26.000]
God bless the footwear industry. Good night, everybody.

[02:20:26.260 --> 02:20:29.380]
God bless the fact that he's gone. He got in that chopper and away they went.

[02:20:30.780 --> 02:20:35.160]
Including Mama Bush and Poppabush and Miguel says last,

[02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:35.220]
cool up, aren't you?

[02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:37.920]
I'm just cool up arenas and cooking a grove is an excellent Cuban restaurant.

[02:20:38.380 --> 02:20:40.340]
Never heard of it. Of course, cool up arenas.

[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:41.740]
Not a good to grow as much as I used to.

[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:42.840]
Why not?

[02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:44.880]
And because it's in Dave County.

[02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:46.020]
That might be.

[02:20:46.100 --> 02:20:46.280]
Oh.

[02:20:47.820 --> 02:20:50.660]
See, I get all kinds of crap because I don't go to Dave County when I'm in town.

[02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:51.800]
Too bad.

[02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:53.100]
I don't want to.

[02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:55.180]
I used to live in Dave County.

[02:20:55.260 --> 02:20:57.560]
I lived in high Alia, highly gardens.

[02:21:00.180 --> 02:21:01.080]
No, is it high?

[02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:01.680]
Miami?

[02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:02.600]
What, whatever the hell it was?

[02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:03.080]
I don't know.

[02:21:03.620 --> 02:21:08.020]
And I lived in Kendall for a long time, long time up and down on 17th Ave.

[02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:13.120]
From Kendall Drive to Sunset, air just about every complex in between.

[02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:16.820]
And then I said to myself, I don't think this is for me anymore.

[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:18.400]
And I moved to Broward and never looked back.

[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:22.520]
We used to do some appearances in Dave County, remember those days?

[02:21:23.020 --> 02:21:23.140]
Yep.

[02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:26.540]
Like in, where do we go?

[02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:27.120]
Like peaches?

[02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:28.020]
Sure.

[02:21:28.020 --> 02:21:30.500]
Specs, places like that that are running out of business.

[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:33.740]
Cutler Ridge.

[02:21:33.960 --> 02:21:34.660]
Remember Cutler Ridge?

[02:21:34.860 --> 02:21:35.340]
Oh, yeah.

[02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:35.840]
That mall.

[02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:38.900]
But that's a long time ago.

[02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:40.500]
You know, we got changing demographics.

[02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:43.400]
No, say, Abla in Glace, Aki.

[02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:44.240]
Okay.

[02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:44.960]
So.

[02:21:45.660 --> 02:21:47.460]
And of course, in your case, what's your excuse?

[02:21:48.020 --> 02:21:48.800]
I don't like it.

[02:21:49.260 --> 02:21:49.860]
I don't want to.

[02:21:49.980 --> 02:21:50.980]
You don't like one, Dave County?

[02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:51.740]
Correct.

[02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:53.520]
As a rule, I mean, there are places in there.

[02:21:53.540 --> 02:21:56.080]
But I mean, one reason, only one reason.

[02:21:56.080 --> 02:21:57.900]
I need no more reasons, the traffic.

[02:21:58.160 --> 02:21:59.520]
I hate driving south of the border.

[02:21:59.860 --> 02:22:02.180]
The traffic, the freaking traffic in this county.

[02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:05.600]
And I'm the traffic in Broward is a picnic.

[02:22:05.940 --> 02:22:07.260]
You want to drive here one day?

[02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:09.840]
You want to drive here one time, one day for about a half an hour?

[02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:10.000]
Sure.

[02:22:10.140 --> 02:22:10.300]
One day.

[02:22:10.300 --> 02:22:11.180]
You would kiss the ground.

[02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:13.480]
You would get out of your car down there and you'd kiss the ground.

[02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:15.180]
By the way, speaking of car, how's your new car coming?

[02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:15.580]
Huh?

[02:22:16.660 --> 02:22:18.140]
I got a couple of cars coming in.

[02:22:18.140 --> 02:22:19.280]
Johnny Jo Belzgan for you.

[02:22:19.380 --> 02:22:19.460]
One.

[02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:20.360]
I'm holding my breath.

[02:22:20.820 --> 02:22:22.340]
There are people talking to people.

[02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:24.960]
But people talking to people.

[02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:26.160]
Go ahead, lot.

[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:26.900]
We're kind of crap.

[02:22:27.020 --> 02:22:28.520]
You're going to sit back and accept that?

[02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:29.320]
Oh.

[02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:31.460]
You want to go up to that Eisenberg and kick my honor.

[02:22:31.580 --> 02:22:32.260]
His nuts should be.

[02:22:32.660 --> 02:22:34.320]
And to say, hey, listen, how's the car coming?

[02:22:34.940 --> 02:22:35.300]
Goofball.

[02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:38.780]
Bob Eisenberg.

[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:41.300]
Boy, if that's your best hope, all I can say to you is good luck.

[02:22:41.540 --> 02:22:43.380]
Well, good luck, sir.

[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:44.200]
Thanks.

[02:22:46.140 --> 02:22:48.180]
Jimmy D is backing in about Panera bread.

[02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:52.320]
No one said the food wasn't good, but there's a moronic segment of the population

[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:55.180]
that thinks their food is somehow better for you than burgers and fries.

[02:22:55.980 --> 02:22:59.040]
Also free Wi-Fi is never a real bonus for any kind of food establishment.

[02:22:59.540 --> 02:23:04.520]
It just gives poser debags and excuse to bring their laptops somewhere public so they can try and look cool.

[02:23:05.580 --> 02:23:08.940]
If you go out to eat, leave your video games and donkey on child porn at home.

[02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:11.720]
Are you working on some kind of dissertation for graduate school?

[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:13.120]
Are you writing another best seller?

[02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:18.020]
No, you're just loving a fantasy and a fantasy land where the cute girl at the table across from you thinks you're a cool guy

[02:23:18.020 --> 02:23:20.560]
and hasn't noticed your laptop battery died 20 minutes ago.

[02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:24.440]
Why do we need a panini that has more calories than a double-wapper with extra cheese and mayo?

[02:23:25.240 --> 02:23:27.460]
Get a life and check your spam email at home.

[02:23:27.740 --> 02:23:29.160]
Sorry, Neil, I'm a little worked up today.

[02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:32.680]
P.S. tell the food's not that Chipotle is owned by McDonald's.

[02:23:34.060 --> 02:23:36.520]
And so on by McDonald's, I don't see anything wrong with that though.

[02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:37.620]
No.

[02:23:38.100 --> 02:23:43.840]
Well, what you're saying is that snob think that a place where the fancier name is like, you know, is like that.

[02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:46.360]
I think it's what's required of you at this moment.

[02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:48.960]
It's the mark of your commitment to public service.

[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:55.360]
But the American people deserve more than simply an assurance that those who are coming to Washington will serve their interests.

[02:23:56.360 --> 02:24:01.080]
They also deserve to know that there are rules on the books to keep it that way.

[02:24:01.540 --> 02:24:05.680]
They deserve a government that is truly of by and for the people.

[02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:07.880]
Well, we're waiting for that. Let's invent one.

[02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:11.140]
That was up 77 points and that's the X-Up 17.

[02:24:11.300 --> 02:24:13.020]
The S&P is up, Neil. It's up nine points.

[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:15.360]
I wonder where it happened to that guy. I hope he lost his ass.

[02:24:16.740 --> 02:24:18.040]
Remember that the S&P is up.

[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:18.200]
Right.

[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:21.080]
Boy, too bad we are going to take any calls today.

[02:24:22.900 --> 02:24:23.440]
Why not?

[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:25.600]
Because I don't want to.

[02:24:26.860 --> 02:24:29.020]
Or do you mean why not? It's too bad.

[02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:34.180]
Because they're going to suck and it's going to be the same this fits.

[02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:35.200]
I'll wait a couple of years.

[02:24:35.320 --> 02:24:36.280]
We got five years to go.

[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:38.960]
I'll wait a couple of years and maybe somebody will like go off them.

[02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:41.780]
Maybe somebody will find them and dispose of them.

[02:24:41.900 --> 02:24:43.880]
And we can go back to like, you know, the near Roger show.

[02:24:44.060 --> 02:24:45.460]
I doubt that's going to ever going to happen.

[02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:48.480]
Oh, it's you, Neil. You went to Toronto.

[02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:50.420]
And that's when you started your decline.

[02:24:50.980 --> 02:24:52.560]
Yeah, right. Blow it out your ass.

[02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:55.460]
All these mavens, all these radio experts.

[02:24:57.040 --> 02:24:58.900]
What time is their show on, by the way?

[02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:03.000]
All these people have got such great concept of what's great to hear.

[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:04.280]
Oh, the Canadian Luny's 7902.

[02:25:04.280 --> 02:25:07.140]
It's on the verge of going under 79 cent.

[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:09.420]
That would be great. Go down about 40 cent would be good.

[02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:11.680]
That would be great.

[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:13.280]
Then I'd feel like wealthy again.

[02:25:14.860 --> 02:25:16.080]
248 votes on your poll.

[02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:18.300]
We can we can get to 300 maybe.

[02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:19.320]
I don't know. You care?

[02:25:19.940 --> 02:25:20.340]
Nope.

[02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:21.200]
I know.

[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:22.560]
Simple.

[02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:25.260]
That's why they're not getting you that car.

[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:26.420]
You don't care. That's it.

[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:27.980]
If you cared enough.

[02:25:29.140 --> 02:25:33.740]
Richard Landau says, okay, Johnny Moe sounds like micrinary with a three-packed A habit.

[02:25:33.740 --> 02:25:35.440]
Renewer used to change smoke too, didn't he?

[02:25:36.020 --> 02:25:36.180]
Yes.

[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:37.940]
And drink a lot.

[02:25:38.900 --> 02:25:39.760]
And then he died.

[02:25:40.740 --> 02:25:42.780]
His death was just shocking to me.

[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:46.740]
I mean, I don't know about you, but when you don't even know that somebody is really sick.

[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:47.360]
Right.

[02:25:47.940 --> 02:25:50.660]
And then all of a sudden one day says, oh, by the way, Renewer, he croaked.

[02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:52.400]
I mean, Jesus, God, right.

[02:25:54.820 --> 02:25:55.140]
But.

[02:25:58.180 --> 02:26:00.880]
And then they remember they had just signed them to a new contract.

[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:03.360]
And they can't his ass that I would end.

[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:05.640]
And they had a pain for a year for not working.

[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:08.020]
I love when it happens like with Paxton and me.

[02:26:08.140 --> 02:26:08.580]
It was great.

[02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:12.360]
Don't you love getting paid not to work?

[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:13.240]
You never had that luxury.

[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:14.300]
Did you know I had it?

[02:26:15.060 --> 02:26:15.680]
I see.

[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:23.660]
Well, we're starting to get a little bit input now on on Cuban food, including Brandon, who's just, wow.

[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:26.220]
That's good.

[02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:27.160]
Kill some good time.

[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:28.280]
We got 38 minutes to go.

[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:28.880]
Not that I'm counting.

[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:31.780]
I'm turning this show today seems like about 20 hours to me.

[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:32.240]
Really?

[02:26:34.140 --> 02:26:39.360]
You remember this morning, I don't want to go into it on the year, but I had like a little traumatic episode this morning when I went downstairs.

[02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:45.140]
And ever since then, those kinds of things, I'm just the kind of person I'm like, you know, drama queen.

[02:26:45.300 --> 02:26:46.680]
Mama, like I told you yesterday.

[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:47.740]
Is that what that means?

[02:26:48.580 --> 02:26:49.140]
You what?

[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:50.420]
Is that what that means?

[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:50.860]
Yes.

[02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:53.560]
Drama queen.

[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:55.900]
Because that's not what it means literally.

[02:26:55.900 --> 02:26:57.440]
Well, I know what it means literally.

[02:26:57.620 --> 02:26:59.640]
Jesus, give me a little bit of credit for crying out loud.

[02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:00.800]
What's wrong with old black mama?

[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:01.360]
Here you go.

[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:01.780]
Nothing.

[02:27:02.340 --> 02:27:03.760]
Is there something wrong with black mama?

[02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:04.720]
Not that I know.

[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:05.960]
It's good enough for your retra.

[02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:08.760]
I still can't believe the way she's saying that thing yesterday.

[02:27:08.940 --> 02:27:09.160]
That was.

[02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:14.040]
Rich and Orlando comes back and wants to debate this thing about Johnny most.

[02:27:15.140 --> 02:27:18.040]
He says, okay, Johnny most sounds like we're near with a three day pack habit.

[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:20.460]
The difference is one octave and some gravel.

[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:22.760]
First of all, he doesn't sound like anything.

[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:23.640]
Well, they're both dead.

[02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:25.500]
So I guess they both sound the same now silent.

[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:29.480]
Chipotle is not owned by McDonald's, but was spun off by McDonald's.

[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:32.820]
It stuck was a kick ass wonder until the market crashed.

[02:27:33.060 --> 02:27:34.460]
Again, the carbs would kill the diabetic.

[02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:37.760]
Try the soup at panero, especially the chicken and wild rice.

[02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:38.860]
You'll be in hog heaven.

[02:27:40.020 --> 02:27:40.880]
I never heard of it.

[02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:41.480]
I don't know where it is.

[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:42.460]
And it sure is hell isn't here.

[02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:45.760]
We have quite a few Mexican restaurants here.

[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:47.460]
No Cuban restaurants that I know of though.

[02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:47.880]
No.

[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:48.860]
I wonder what that is.

[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:49.740]
No Cuban?

[02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:50.820]
That could be it.

[02:27:51.780 --> 02:27:57.280]
Chuck and Chicago says Chipotle is great if you're a pig who wants the stuff you're face with a pile of rice and crap.

[02:27:58.080 --> 02:27:59.640]
The meat is marginal at best.

[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:00.500]
You want a burrito?

[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:03.140]
The tortilla, tortilla alone has 44 carbs.

[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:05.180]
The rice they threw in has another two carbs.

[02:28:07.820 --> 02:28:09.100]
Maybe there's more than two.

[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:10.800]
Maybe it's chopped off there in the right hand margin.

[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:12.480]
Panera's a bakery.

[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:14.700]
They sell sandwiches, salads, and soups.

[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:15.640]
The soups are pretty good.

[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:17.560]
Now let me ask you.

[02:28:17.620 --> 02:28:18.180]
Do you say soup?

[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:18.940]
Do you say soup?

[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:20.160]
Soup?

[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:21.200]
Is it a collective noun?

[02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:22.020]
Wait a minute.

[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:24.920]
If it's different kinds of soup, then you have to say soups.

[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:26.580]
Same thing with fishes and deer's.

[02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:27.260]
How about cheeses?

[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:28.180]
That too.

[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:29.280]
Cheeses, Christ.

[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:30.440]
Almighty.

[02:28:30.900 --> 02:28:32.520]
Chuck says I fly American Airlines a lot.

[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:33.140]
Yeah, American.

[02:28:33.420 --> 02:28:34.320]
They're not too bad out of Chicago.

[02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:38.200]
In all honesty, the only times I really have problems with them is when I have to go through Miami.

[02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:41.080]
I fly them a good bunch and frequently I'm in first class.

[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:43.360]
I have many times passed on the meal.

[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:46.740]
I've heard requested the cheese in Salami since I could buy in coach.

[02:28:47.060 --> 02:28:47.920]
Okay, I'm going to do it.

[02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:53.020]
I'm going to get that magazine out when I sit my ass down next time on Scare Canada.

[02:28:53.220 --> 02:28:53.720]
I'll come down there.

[02:28:54.060 --> 02:28:56.660]
And I'm going to order some snack food from the back.

[02:28:57.080 --> 02:28:57.660]
Snack from the back.

[02:28:57.880 --> 02:28:58.080]
All right.

[02:28:58.240 --> 02:28:58.820]
And pay for it.

[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:02.920]
I mean, if you can afford to pay 80 zillion dollars to fly a round trip to a four-loader deal,

[02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:06.440]
you can afford to pay four or five six bucks for like something you want to eat.

[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:13.160]
As opposed to the, you want to stake the chicken or the tilapia or the round snails

[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:14.640]
that are still moving around in the plate.

[02:29:14.900 --> 02:29:15.740]
Oh, God.

[02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:18.800]
What mung?

[02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:25.220]
A warning, Chef Francisco de Pupu is creating the food for Scare Canada this year.

[02:29:26.200 --> 02:29:26.640]
Yeah.

[02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:28.180]
I say throw them out.

[02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:29.300]
Open the door and throw them out.

[02:29:30.460 --> 02:29:32.120]
Brandon says there's a chipotle on.

[02:29:32.260 --> 02:29:33.720]
I was a chipotle or chipotle.

[02:29:34.100 --> 02:29:35.100]
I don't know how you say it.

[02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:37.120]
Well, he's spilling it wrong.

[02:29:37.340 --> 02:29:40.280]
There's a chipotle on pines and hiatus and new home depot shopping center.

[02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:42.880]
And here's something George might like to give free food away a lot.

[02:29:43.140 --> 02:29:43.440]
Wow.

[02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:45.180]
For Halloween, you get free burritos.

[02:29:45.180 --> 02:29:47.080]
Just have a piece of foil wrapped around your wrist.

[02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:47.720]
Woo.

[02:29:48.660 --> 02:29:50.620]
Basically, what it is you go in and has three menus.

[02:29:50.840 --> 02:29:53.380]
The first is your meat, second is your rice, and third is the topping.

[02:29:53.940 --> 02:29:55.980]
And you pick one from each and that's how you build your burrito.

[02:29:56.360 --> 02:29:58.460]
Careful though, because some of their stuff is real spicy.

[02:29:58.820 --> 02:29:59.200]
Oh, yeah.

[02:30:00.460 --> 02:30:02.620]
The Latino is like it's spicy and the food too.

[02:30:03.780 --> 02:30:06.440]
Latin American grill and pepper pines sometimes has really good Cuban food.

[02:30:06.760 --> 02:30:07.780]
Have to catch them on a good day.

[02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:11.240]
But Las Vegas certainly is the tops and there are a few locations in date.

[02:30:11.780 --> 02:30:15.140]
When I can't make it to the one in Hollywood, I'll celebrate in the two locations in the pines.

[02:30:15.140 --> 02:30:17.880]
But there's something about the original one in Hollywood way above anything.

[02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:22.520]
Now the parking situation there is a little bit crappy, but it's a small price to pay for Las Vegas.

[02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:26.160]
Maybe Bob Lincoln stands outside and sings Viva osue.

[02:30:26.300 --> 02:30:27.220]
I hope you like it.

[02:30:27.220 --> 02:30:29.300]
Anybody have a hard or a liver?

[02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:34.040]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

[02:30:34.380 --> 02:30:38.460]
I am an angry Cuban man with a lot of cuisine.

[02:30:39.060 --> 02:30:43.100]
In a Spanish dialect that no one can translate.

[02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:45.020]
I call it a phrase.

[02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:56.040]
or dogs chose to change the world my way but I said in Cuban baby talk baby talks what I'm

[02:30:56.040 --> 02:31:10.620]
using I see things wrapped all day on the palm of expressway the cars not go so I use

[02:31:10.620 --> 02:31:20.600]
myself for to call my favorite favorite talk goes and I say I'm a 40 year old man you may find

[02:31:20.600 --> 02:31:28.060]
that hard to believe my broke in English is so bad I sound like a baby would just the same

[02:31:28.060 --> 02:31:37.600]
I make demands that you are crazy with me and understand my human baby talk I'm using

[02:31:40.620 --> 02:31:42.960]
do

[02:31:42.960 --> 02:31:43.480]
like

[02:31:43.480 --> 02:32:08.520]
bad yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and yeah it's 2 year old

[02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:14.320]
and the thing that convinces me that we have no Cuban listeners on this show, maybe one or two,

[02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:18.260]
is the fact that, you know, somebody asks, we're working to get really good Cuban food in

[02:32:18.260 --> 02:32:23.580]
Dave County and we get like nothing. Oh, as opposed to when you ask another question,

[02:32:23.660 --> 02:32:28.480]
you get something? No. So you say that, I know you're doing it to be facetious because

[02:32:28.480 --> 02:32:31.780]
every time we have an appearance and every time it goes somewhere, you get all these people saying,

[02:32:31.780 --> 02:32:36.260]
I'm Cuban, I'm a listener, Cuban listener, they really continuously listen to you. No, you refuse.

[02:32:36.260 --> 02:32:41.160]
You love it because of your hatred, your seething bigotry. What? You refuse to acknowledge that

[02:32:41.160 --> 02:32:46.340]
a huge chunk of the audience is Cuban. You take these poles, you see it on the poles all the time,

[02:32:46.460 --> 02:32:52.680]
but you just want to rip and rip. So go ahead. A huge percentage of you. What the hell are you

[02:32:52.680 --> 02:32:56.280]
talking about? A huge percentage of the audience is Cuban. Everyone would love to live

[02:32:56.280 --> 02:33:00.260]
and let's check out the diaries. Okay. When you see Clarence next time, I have a million

[02:33:00.260 --> 02:33:06.560]
of the over 50, 60 year old crowd. You know, you like the chicken pig. Why? Oh, cherry pig. I'm sorry.

[02:33:08.720 --> 02:33:13.540]
Jim from Chicago or Trevor, whatever his name is, Trevor says, I'm from Chicago where they have

[02:33:13.540 --> 02:33:17.040]
the best steak burritos in the world and I miss them. Does anybody out there know we can get a good

[02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:22.160]
steak burrito in South Florida? Thanks, Rachel Jones is for a burrito Trevor. Well, there's the question

[02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:26.060]
anybody know where you can get a good steak burrito in South Florida? That's a good question. Oh,

[02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:34.280]
what a steak burrito sounds good. Does sound good. Would like onions and stuff and like squeeze

[02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:43.740]
cheese. I still miss that clucker, Viva. In fact, on sunset, is it on sunset in Kendall? Yes,

[02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:47.780]
there's a strip shopping mall where there used to be Godfather's. I think it was the first God

[02:33:47.780 --> 02:33:52.540]
Fathers in town. And they're also on the other side of the little strip shopping mall across from

[02:33:52.540 --> 02:33:57.780]
it was Taco Viva. Okay. Where they had a great taco is with a great real real good meat and

[02:33:57.780 --> 02:34:02.520]
squeeze cheese. I barely remember them. How many years since they've been in business? 100. Wow.

[02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:08.720]
It was damn good. And yeah, it was better than Taco Smell. It was. I remember that much. So,

[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:12.740]
as a wolves man, wolves was a great fast food joy. I'm a great burger joy with the best onion rings

[02:34:12.740 --> 02:34:17.480]
I've ever seen in my life. I tell you who's got really great onion rings is Ruth Chris. Yeah.

[02:34:17.540 --> 02:34:22.520]
Did you know that? No, I didn't. Well, next time somebody takes you there for a great meal. That's

[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:28.100]
important. Anything. Well, Miguel says if you've eaten Thai food in Toronto, which I have not,

[02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:33.000]
have you had the green mango salad? They don't have it in any Thai restaurant south food. If you

[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:38.460]
haven't had to give it a try, no, I don't like mango. I like mango. And I don't, I hate guacamole. Oh,

[02:34:38.720 --> 02:34:45.000]
geez. I ain't crazy about Thai food. You're not? But coconut and peanuts and like almost everything.

[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:52.840]
The very few Thai dishes that can handle Dorothy M just buzzed me here. I'm like, it's by healthy,

[02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:57.040]
be healthy using authentic drugs from licensed pharmacy. Go to hell, Dorothy. Quit buzzing my

[02:34:57.040 --> 02:35:02.840]
crackberry. I'm so sick and tired these days. There needs to be a law. Okay. I thought there was a law.

[02:35:03.860 --> 02:35:11.020]
But they got to stop spanning us with this crap. You don't think so? Mm-hmm. You get a lot of it?

[02:35:11.020 --> 02:35:15.220]
Lots. See you. Alice and Viagra. Boy, you talk about barking up the wrong tree.

[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:22.520]
Dan says just had a pack of cat six packet castle burger. So Wayne is, I was leaving as good as it

[02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:30.340]
gets. Wayne Arles is open again. 125th and Northwest 7th at 441. Wayne is open after a long time down

[02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:39.320]
after that fire. 261 votes on the poll. 150 agree with May 65. I agree with you.

[02:35:40.180 --> 02:35:44.420]
And everybody else says we're both full of crap. The sets is I'm a Cuban American girl born and raised

[02:35:44.420 --> 02:35:50.540]
in Miami now living in Palm Beach. My favorite Cuban restaurant is Casa Romo off 67th Avenue.

[02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:56.140]
It has great food and affordable price. I love the show. What lady? What? 67th and what?

[02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:02.480]
Well, I don't know. It's just on the 67th Avenue. Maybe the Palm Meadow.

[02:36:05.980 --> 02:36:11.180]
What? Maybe? And maybe not. Come on. Let's say we want to learn a lot more detail. Exactly.

[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:16.880]
Casa ROMEA. I guess I could Google it. Casa Romo. Although I don't get in that.

[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:22.580]
Jimmy D says Baja Cafe for the Esteec Rito in a discussion. He doesn't tell us where it is though.

[02:36:22.980 --> 02:36:30.640]
Baja Cafe. He says. Okay. Caesar says I was just ordering a neatly burger at other food when

[02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:34.840]
Mr. Arnold pulls up. We talked for a few minutes about him rebuilding the restaurant. How he's

[02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:40.240]
listening since Zeta like me. He was a pleasure to talk to. By the way, I work with a fan your local

[02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:44.380]
critic. I think he misses you since he got banned. Anyway, have a great day and the food was excellent.

[02:36:44.660 --> 02:36:48.800]
He works with a fan. Remember that idiot? Yeah. Called in that day just about how to stroke. He pulled

[02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:53.100]
a tent Kennedy right on the air. It sees you around the air. You don't let anybody talk with his

[02:36:53.100 --> 02:37:02.460]
and just it just lost it on the phone. So you people that continue writing Costa. I'm not interested.

[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:06.640]
You know, I mean, you don't have to kiss my ass. That's not a prerequisite for calling or

[02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:10.900]
sending an email. But my God, if you just want to send a bunch of Costa crap, I'm not interested.

[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:16.620]
Everybody's life is full of enough Costa crap without getting it from strangers. God.

[02:37:17.500 --> 02:37:21.520]
Brandon says Baja Fresh Express has got great steak for Rito's. There's one in four

[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:27.140]
Saturday on US one right off of Broward Boulevard. Great. See you least breaking Brandon right. He gives us a location.

[02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:34.080]
No, that was you. I heard that mean. Sorry. Maybe that's Mary Johnson with some pills for your

[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:39.160]
Johnson. Okay. Here's a pull suggestion from Brandon. When it comes to food, I'd rather do more

[02:37:39.160 --> 02:37:44.680]
quantity over quality, more quality over quantity. I'm 50, 50. It's all food who cares. Yeah, I'll keep

[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:55.020]
that in my pile for a while. Oh, Jimmy, do you give it a rest, Jimmy? I know you're all worked

[02:37:55.020 --> 02:38:00.160]
up today, but give it a rest. God. So what did we find out? Is there a good place for a

[02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:07.340]
to-leaf us? Oh, Baja for the steak, Brito's. Yeah. That does sound good. Taco Viva. And all these people

[02:38:07.340 --> 02:38:10.840]
who keep criticizing those of us old farts like me, and probably you, there's some extent,

[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:15.920]
about how there used to be all these great places and there aren't any more. What's true? Right,

[02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:21.640]
they'll see. I mean, you can go to the Hess gas station and you know, that's that make believe

[02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:27.820]
Godfather stuff, but they ain't nothing like the original Godfather. That one with Javier.

[02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:33.820]
When that's something that was like, that was like almost 30 years ago. I'm thinking 1980,

[02:38:34.040 --> 02:38:38.600]
a WS news that he came into the station and they bought spots and I helped to put them on a map

[02:38:38.600 --> 02:38:42.200]
and the audio. Back in those days, I used to put a lot of people on the map, the Bokehburgers

[02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:48.420]
and then in Jerry's and all kinds of stuff. Snapple. But then I came to QAM where, oh, what you

[02:38:48.420 --> 02:38:52.680]
don't do a sports show? We can't be bothered with that Rogers. He's just a troublemaker and that

[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:57.480]
little spick sidekick of his. Yep. I'm sorry. I said that word again. Yeah, there you go. Then I'll

[02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:02.220]
just say, he'll be sending another and wherever Horton. He'll be sending another email. Oh, I heard

[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:07.720]
you use that word. Yeah, I'll screw you. It's okay if I say Faggot, but if I use some other word,

[02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:12.000]
and again, whatever happened to something called Sensei Humor, which obviously that guy isn't

[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:17.080]
to have. See, people that want to be offended, they pretend they have no sensei Humor. They know

[02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:20.440]
you're saying something is a joke. They know there's not a chance in a million you would say it

[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:27.580]
seriously, but oh, I heard him say this. I asked, screw you. Screw off any. David's a bitch.

[02:39:32.260 --> 02:39:34.440]
Yes. It's been rough on my attention that the

[02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:39.340]
narrating said, Diane, and how? Well, I don't want to show you what a big ass say that I was

[02:39:39.340 --> 02:39:44.180]
to your hand. How? You get quite somebody good enough to fill my biggy pants?

[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:46.120]
It ain't easy.

[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:51.980]
Don't, don't, don't, don't. Very no, Jax. I love it. Be coming back.

[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:56.420]
How tight are you considering a little word of the indirect?

[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:01.000]
If you want to know, and I'll save you if I'm shutting that transmitted to the

[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:36.580]
audience, I'm not. Which radio has everybody doing the biggest ever was?

[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:39.100]
And we did.

[02:40:41.100 --> 02:40:41.280]
Yeah.

[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:48.060]
All you need is now. Now, we do. All you need is now.

[02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:52.600]
You can move on. You can move on. All you need is a show.

[02:40:52.940 --> 02:40:53.960]
And you can go on.

[02:40:54.860 --> 02:40:55.660]
Why, for all?

[02:41:05.540 --> 02:41:08.440]
Oh, here's somebody that says Taco Vivo is the Schmitz.

[02:41:09.460 --> 02:41:12.220]
You're right. In fact, it would give you the Schmitz, too.

[02:41:13.700 --> 02:41:16.040]
It says the El Scorcho sauce was great.

[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:20.480]
You can't hold a candle to the place called Lime Fresh Mexican Grill.

[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:23.340]
Do you ever hear of it?

[02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:24.200]
No.

[02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:27.040]
Two locations north Miami Beach and Pemberg Gardens Mall.

[02:41:27.300 --> 02:41:29.600]
The steak burritos and the fajitas blow away Chipotle.

[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:31.960]
Listening since 87 Rob and South Miami.

[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:33.820]
Thanks Rob. How do you like that?

[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:35.240]
And Brandon is back again.

[02:41:35.340 --> 02:41:37.340]
You get food going and Brandon just all over the place.

[02:41:38.900 --> 02:41:40.380]
What I would like to see more of itself.

[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:44.280]
Food is barbecue food. He says, oh, that's why they built a metro rail.

[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:46.260]
Everybody go to what's the name of that place?

[02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:46.820]
Shorties.

[02:41:46.980 --> 02:41:47.900]
Shorties ribs.

[02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:49.720]
Shorties barbecue.

[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:52.720]
Personally, I don't like barbecue.

[02:41:52.820 --> 02:41:53.400]
How do you like that?

[02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:54.020]
Okay.

[02:41:54.020 --> 02:41:55.540]
If I never had it again, it would be too soon.

[02:41:55.760 --> 02:41:56.740]
Well, I like it. I'll have your pork.

[02:41:56.740 --> 02:41:58.220]
There are a couple of places where the food is all right,

[02:41:58.300 --> 02:41:59.460]
but nothing that makes you weak in the knees.

[02:41:59.840 --> 02:42:03.800]
I want a good place to have some nice pulled pork or barbecue brisket

[02:42:03.800 --> 02:42:05.680]
and of course ribs hard to find here.

[02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:06.420]
I got to go to North Carolina.

[02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:07.660]
He gets some good pulled pork.

[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:08.440]
Pulled pork.

[02:42:08.620 --> 02:42:08.700]
Yeah.

[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:10.180]
Smoking on the lines about that.

[02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:10.980]
But I won't say them.

[02:42:11.140 --> 02:42:11.540]
It's heavenly.

[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:14.740]
And believe me, I'm sure Brandon knows about that.

[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:16.980]
Lissette emails back.

[02:42:18.620 --> 02:42:20.560]
Well, it must be a banner day today.

[02:42:20.660 --> 02:42:22.540]
People are actually responding to what we were talking about.

[02:42:22.780 --> 02:42:23.180]
Write it down.

[02:42:24.900 --> 02:42:26.860]
Lissette says, tell George Casa Romo,

[02:42:27.100 --> 02:42:29.180]
rhymes with Homo, is located at 67th Avenue,

[02:42:29.300 --> 02:42:30.060]
Miami Gardens Drive.

[02:42:30.420 --> 02:42:31.220]
Oh, thanks, Lissette.

[02:42:31.540 --> 02:42:31.800]
Thank you.

[02:42:32.300 --> 02:42:33.360]
And that's right where I was thinking.

[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:34.760]
That's not that far, actually.

[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:36.340]
Isn't that off the Palmeiro?

[02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:38.900]
Well, it's sitting.

[02:42:38.980 --> 02:42:40.600]
Now, when 67th Avenue is what?

[02:42:40.780 --> 02:42:41.420]
Is that Love the Maraud?

[02:42:41.540 --> 02:42:41.860]
Yes, it is.

[02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:42.300]
Very good.

[02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:45.440]
Well, I'm very good because I worked there for 100 years at WS News.

[02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:45.780]
Right.

[02:42:46.060 --> 02:42:48.260]
At both clauses and runs parallel to the Palmeiro.

[02:42:48.420 --> 02:42:49.360]
So right.

[02:42:50.540 --> 02:42:52.340]
Boy, there used to be some good restaurants in that.

[02:42:52.420 --> 02:42:54.060]
In the woods, what was the great Chinese restaurant?

[02:42:54.320 --> 02:42:54.900]
I don't know.

[02:42:55.360 --> 02:42:57.020]
There was on Dixie Highway in Love the Maraud.

[02:42:57.340 --> 02:42:57.500]
Canton.

[02:42:58.020 --> 02:42:58.340]
Canton, Canton.

[02:42:58.660 --> 02:42:58.980]
Was at it?

[02:42:59.300 --> 02:43:00.380]
They have several locations.

[02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:02.160]
And there was a, not Tony Romans.

[02:43:02.300 --> 02:43:04.020]
What was the other Bobby Robino's there, I think?

[02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:06.860]
And a great Chinese join in there,

[02:43:06.860 --> 02:43:07.460]
which I can't remember.

[02:43:07.700 --> 02:43:09.400]
I just got through saying Canton, Canton.

[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:10.020]
I just said it.

[02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:11.300]
See, you're losing it, old man.

[02:43:11.460 --> 02:43:11.780]
That's right.

[02:43:12.300 --> 02:43:13.340]
And I really don't care.

[02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:13.940]
Good.

[02:43:15.020 --> 02:43:16.140]
I get home every day.

[02:43:16.220 --> 02:43:17.560]
I find my way home from Woodbine.

[02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:18.340]
I drive just fine.

[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:19.920]
Yeah, I walk around.

[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:21.780]
I get from the back of the studio.

[02:43:22.260 --> 02:43:22.960]
I don't have no locker.

[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:24.280]
Yeah, tennis balls on the end.

[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:26.440]
That's what made me feel so good watching old man Bush.

[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:28.860]
And Cheney there in the wheelchair.

[02:43:29.300 --> 02:43:30.480]
Oh, he heard his back movie.

[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:31.220]
Yeah, he heard his back.

[02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:33.380]
The Lord is Lord is smiting his ass

[02:43:34.420 --> 02:43:37.560]
for all the people that he and Bush and Cheney,

[02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:39.380]
whatever their name is, Bushard.

[02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:41.420]
See, you're losing it.

[02:43:41.420 --> 02:43:43.920]
Oh, well, I just want to give these people an opportunity

[02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:45.480]
to send their hateful email.

[02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:47.740]
Oh, you keep repeating yourself and you read that one email

[02:43:47.740 --> 02:43:48.880]
about Toronto.

[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:49.960]
Okay, good.

[02:43:50.220 --> 02:43:50.600]
Who cares?

[02:43:50.860 --> 02:43:51.760]
Let's go to where they work.

[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:52.960]
Let's follow them around all day.

[02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:53.560]
Let's go.

[02:43:53.860 --> 02:43:54.120]
Wait a minute.

[02:43:54.260 --> 02:43:54.500]
Wait a minute.

[02:43:54.540 --> 02:43:56.500]
Here, here, I'm glad you said he must be psychic.

[02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:00.840]
This is the same emailer that sent the cost of crap before about.

[02:44:01.220 --> 02:44:01.740]
How I read the,

[02:44:02.380 --> 02:44:05.020]
since I moved to Toronto, that's when the show lost it said,

[02:44:05.220 --> 02:44:06.180]
this is the same jackass.

[02:44:07.580 --> 02:44:09.680]
I guess they think that if they use a phone number,

[02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:12.300]
I will recognize what the phone number is.

[02:44:13.020 --> 02:44:14.440]
I won't recognize it.

[02:44:15.260 --> 02:44:17.600]
Reason that you talk about how there used to be all these great restaurants

[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:20.500]
and there aren't any longer is because you haven't tried anything new in 10 years,

[02:44:20.500 --> 02:44:22.740]
except maybe for cheesecake, Lux, of course.

[02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:26.080]
So here's a guy that follows me around all day.

[02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:29.360]
He knows all the places where I eat the restaurants and the food and yada full of crap.

[02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:33.040]
In addition to which I bet you this guy hasn't had the the

[02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:35.540]
Inus Burger with Bacon and Cheddar because he can't get it there.

[02:44:35.540 --> 02:44:39.140]
I haven't tried anything new in 10 years.

[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:40.700]
Oh my God.

[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.600]
The food that I've consumed to maintain this girth,

[02:44:43.740 --> 02:44:44.980]
you've got to be schmitten me man.

[02:44:45.620 --> 02:44:45.940]
Yeah.

[02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:47.480]
Really?

[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:49.120]
You've got to try new things.

[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:51.660]
279 votes on the poll.

[02:44:51.780 --> 02:44:52.940]
We're not going to make 300 voters shame.

[02:44:53.220 --> 02:44:54.840]
Fat Chris would be disappointed, but you know what?

[02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:55.240]
Too bad.

[02:44:55.480 --> 02:44:56.460]
He doesn't care about us.

[02:44:57.540 --> 02:45:00.340]
All that time that he was on the show for like how long two years?

[02:45:00.740 --> 02:45:00.980]
Okay.

[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:03.240]
Brandon's back again.

[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:05.240]
Calm down Brandon, but thanks for all the good stuff.

[02:45:05.240 --> 02:45:07.820]
I can't believe nobody mentioned Versailles in Little Havana.

[02:45:07.820 --> 02:45:09.260]
It doesn't get any more Cuban than that.

[02:45:09.740 --> 02:45:10.840]
You hear Versailles?

[02:45:11.060 --> 02:45:13.600]
I've been there with all due respect.

[02:45:13.900 --> 02:45:14.920]
It's a shame to find it.

[02:45:14.940 --> 02:45:16.800]
It's the Joe Stone crabs of Cuban.

[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:17.160]
Wow.

[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:17.700]
Yeah.

[02:45:18.220 --> 02:45:18.880]
Very famous.

[02:45:19.060 --> 02:45:19.100]
Very famous.

[02:45:19.100 --> 02:45:19.400]
Joe Stone crabs.

[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:19.980]
Highly famous.

[02:45:20.180 --> 02:45:21.320]
I was very underwhelmed.

[02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:22.640]
It's no Las Vegas, how's that?

[02:45:24.300 --> 02:45:25.780]
So Las Vegas is a place to go.

[02:45:25.820 --> 02:45:26.340]
That's the place.

[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:27.060]
I'll take you there.

[02:45:27.940 --> 02:45:28.880]
You'll take me there.

[02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:30.340]
Gently and I'll tell you what to order.

[02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:32.600]
I can go to La Carreta if I wanted to go there.

[02:45:32.960 --> 02:45:33.780]
They might skip it.

[02:45:33.940 --> 02:45:34.220]
Skip it.

[02:45:34.220 --> 02:45:37.140]
Now some restaurants, I mean,

[02:45:37.260 --> 02:45:39.060]
some airports have really good restaurants in them.

[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:41.240]
But not Miami or Fort Lauderdale.

[02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:41.780]
I don't think.

[02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:46.280]
I would every now and then you'll find a restaurant.

[02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:49.060]
I mean, airport with like Pearson Airport in Toronto.

[02:45:49.260 --> 02:45:50.060]
Crapie food inside.

[02:45:50.280 --> 02:45:51.140]
Oh my god.

[02:45:51.540 --> 02:45:51.940]
Crapo.

[02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:56.180]
Here's an article by Chuck Strauss.

[02:45:57.540 --> 02:45:59.680]
I would be nice if I could see where this was from.

[02:46:01.640 --> 02:46:02.680]
Somebody sent this to me.

[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:04.500]
Mama B who sends me a lot of good stuff.

[02:46:05.260 --> 02:46:06.320]
Is this from the herald?

[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:07.020]
Is this from something?

[02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:08.740]
Royal Castle returns.

[02:46:08.740 --> 02:46:09.560]
A Miami landmark.

[02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:10.360]
Mason come back.

[02:46:11.460 --> 02:46:12.960]
It says you know the tiny hamburger.

[02:46:13.120 --> 02:46:15.300]
Some other woodenions who dreamed about after well.

[02:46:15.300 --> 02:46:16.400]
A little glowing preparation.

[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:19.460]
The one you could buy anywhere in date county from the 1950s till 1977.

[02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:20.740]
Arnels, Royal Castle.

[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:23.860]
The tiny restaurant on the corner north west of

[02:46:23.860 --> 02:46:25.460]
Avenue and 124th Street, North Miami.

[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:28.180]
Quietly open January 1 for the first time since the fire.

[02:46:28.580 --> 02:46:30.300]
Go to the place three and a half years ago.

[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:31.220]
Three and a half years.

[02:46:32.300 --> 02:46:32.740]
Wow.

[02:46:33.260 --> 02:46:35.280]
There were 900 for customers in opening.

[02:46:35.300 --> 02:46:37.680]
They it's doing more business than ever before said owner rain.

[02:46:37.700 --> 02:46:39.660]
Arle unbelievable is what he said.

[02:46:39.780 --> 02:46:40.380]
Un-

[02:46:40.380 --> 02:46:40.900]
Unbelievable.

[02:46:41.860 --> 02:46:45.700]
Arneald now 70 years old and living in Davy went to work for Royal Castle back in 1961

[02:46:45.700 --> 02:46:48.660]
when the burger that cost 99 cents went for 15 pennies.

[02:46:48.900 --> 02:46:51.800]
The company moved him around the South till burger chef bought it in 73

[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:53.880]
and then declared bankruptcy four years later.

[02:46:54.100 --> 02:46:54.600]
He was fired.

[02:46:55.700 --> 02:46:57.640]
Arneald bought the North Miami place in 1980.

[02:46:57.640 --> 02:46:59.920]
We opened it in 82 for next 23 years.

[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:01.200]
It was open 24 seven.

[02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:03.640]
It burned in late 2005 after a storage.

[02:47:04.300 --> 02:47:04.980]
Door fire.

[02:47:06.100 --> 02:47:06.940]
Storage room fire.

[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:09.160]
Whatever it says now everything's new except the floor.

[02:47:09.160 --> 02:47:11.740]
Arneald said the menu is the same except for the chicken wings.

[02:47:11.860 --> 02:47:15.120]
Birch beer that once once went for seven cents a glass now goes for a buck.

[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:17.820]
But that's with all the refills you can get Arnold notes.

[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:19.260]
A buck something I think.

[02:47:19.380 --> 02:47:20.240]
Well, it's chopped off.

[02:47:20.300 --> 02:47:21.000]
You know how that goes.

[02:47:21.140 --> 02:47:23.020]
Of course trouble still looms.

[02:47:23.100 --> 02:47:26.120]
There's only one other Royal Castle in Miami date at North West 79th Street

[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:26.920]
and 27th Avenue.

[02:47:27.220 --> 02:47:29.760]
I don't know if they even have the rights that the name manager LeVern Wright says.

[02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:31.000]
We have a long history here.

[02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:33.260]
Trouble still looms.

[02:47:33.340 --> 02:47:34.060]
Well, what does that mean?

[02:47:34.220 --> 02:47:34.940]
Trouble still looms.

[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:35.460]
I don't know.

[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:39.580]
The fact that there's that other one that that's also been there for a long time.

[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:45.140]
And we don't talk about it because we're friends with Wayne.

[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:46.140]
Yeah, it's not in Wayne.

[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:47.360]
Bring you any food that you can pay for.

[02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:47.820]
No.

[02:47:48.260 --> 02:47:50.460]
Did I email you that that that facts you that thing?

[02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:52.060]
Oh, you sent me a facts earlier by the way.

[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:53.180]
Turned out to be a blank page.

[02:47:53.980 --> 02:47:54.100]
Huh.

[02:47:54.580 --> 02:47:55.400]
Was it anything important?

[02:47:56.580 --> 02:47:57.320]
Was it for me?

[02:47:57.880 --> 02:47:59.840]
Yeah, it was said had your name on top.

[02:47:59.980 --> 02:48:00.300]
Huh.

[02:48:00.580 --> 02:48:00.940]
I don't remember.

[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:02.240]
It was from there.

[02:48:02.340 --> 02:48:03.800]
It was from La Rada, Ua Stasion.

[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:05.320]
That's not been anything important.

[02:48:07.220 --> 02:48:09.140]
Maybe it was all about that new car that got you.

[02:48:09.220 --> 02:48:09.920]
That must have been it.

[02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:11.920]
Okay, I don't want to start up.

[02:48:12.020 --> 02:48:13.380]
But was this another five minute break?

[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:14.540]
I guess so.

[02:48:14.980 --> 02:48:15.780]
There's a promo there.

[02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:19.020]
There's a one that was a promo that wasn't on the log.

[02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:19.880]
It's okay if we go over.

[02:48:20.180 --> 02:48:20.620]
They go don't care.

[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:23.180]
No, we're not going to go over.

[02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:24.180]
We're going to go under whatever.

[02:48:25.020 --> 02:48:27.600]
And maybe the big old can sure that one one with us.

[02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:29.280]
Go over, go under.

[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:31.960]
Inside.

[02:48:32.380 --> 02:48:32.740]
Sure.

[02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:33.460]
Outside.

[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:34.020]
Neon.

[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:34.680]
God.

[02:48:35.340 --> 02:48:36.400]
Hi guys and gals.

[02:48:36.700 --> 02:48:38.680]
I'm Alaska Governor Sarah Pia land.

[02:48:38.880 --> 02:48:41.060]
When I'm not shooting Carabou from a helicopter

[02:48:41.060 --> 02:48:42.980]
hovering 50 feet off the ground.

[02:48:43.340 --> 02:48:46.280]
I'm a 44 year old wife, mother and future grandmother

[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:49.600]

[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:51.420]

[02:48:51.620 --> 02:48:53.480]

[02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:08.040]
Neom after the religious practice, I no longer associate myself with

[02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:09.760]
due to its controversial nature.

[02:49:10.100 --> 02:49:12.920]
Pianocostal perfume will make you smell divine.

[02:49:13.880 --> 02:49:15.440]
And make you speak in tongue.

[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:22.220]
It's perfect for all occasions.

[02:49:22.220 --> 02:49:26.600]
Whether you're hunting or running or taking a field trip to the

[02:49:26.600 --> 02:49:27.660]
nuclear plant.

[02:49:27.700 --> 02:49:28.620]
Gosh darn it.

[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:30.500]
This is a fragrance for all you gals.

[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:33.400]
Other perfumes just pale in comparison.

[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:37.820]
