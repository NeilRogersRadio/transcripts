[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]
No person of this particular

[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.240]
I'm here though

[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.080]
I'm here though

[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.780]
I'm here though

[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.700]
I'm here though

[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.440]
I'm here though

[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.440]

[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.520]
I'm here

[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.460]
5-6-1-W-Q-A-M

[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:11.980]
I am

[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.000]
For the Lutterdale

[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.160]
I'm there

[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.380]
I'm there

[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.060]
I'm there

[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.680]
I'm there

[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.440]
I'm there

[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.540]
What are you trying to say?

[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.340]
I am feeling so great

[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.440]
5-60-W-Q-A-M

[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.560]
Neil

[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.120]
Or pound 5-60 on your 90-odd

[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.160]
And the Fiddle and the Fides of Wireless phones

[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.280]
The opinions of this guy can do that

[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.680]
His guests or his collars

[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.260]
Do not represent those of WQ-A-M management staff

[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.940]
No sponsors

[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.900]
Now the Neil Roger Show

[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.580]
On 5-60-W-Q-A-M

[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.040]
Neil

[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.280]
Yeah

[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.640]
Let me just say that

[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.020]
Marilyn was one of my closest friends in the biz

[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.800]
And her death

[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.700]
Has hit me so hard

[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.480]
It's so hard

[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400]
Oh, it's so hard

[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.660]
Oh, oh, I'm gonna miss her

[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.720]
Oh, oh, oh, my God

[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.000]
Hey, man

[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.360]
Poor Marilyn Chamber

[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.960]
She ain't gonna be making no more porno

[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.820]
Unless the Ismerelde factor comes back

[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.920]
What do you think?

[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.200]
Okay

[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.900]
If they want Susan Poirot to make a porno movie

[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.580]
Why not do some stiff, you know?

[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.960]
Right

[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.020]
10-01 at 5-60-W-Q-A-M

[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.500]
It's Tuesday

[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.720]
Boy, I'll tell you, I'm just...

[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.920]
If I didn't have all the flame, I'd feel fine

[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.500]
Not fine, but decent, you know?

[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.940]
That's fine

[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.460]
But I don't

[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.460]
Or I do or something

[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.200]
Bad, really bad crap

[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.860]
This is what the Lord has done

[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.020]
Your God created colds and flu

[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.820]
And all of this crap

[00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.740]
All of these things

[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.360]
That was down only 18 points

[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.380]
That's not so bad, huh?

[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.080]
Right

[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260]
I'll take it to talk real slow today

[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.320]
Real slow and deliver

[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.460]
We don't have a whole lot of stuff

[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.180]
I'll tell you that

[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.020]
Neil at NeilRodgers.com

[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.120]
That's where those precious emails come in

[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.460]
And I noticed that

[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.500]
Yesterday at least

[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.100]
You heard the sirens already?

[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.780]
Oh, boy

[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.800]
At least one good thing

[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.220]
I'm close to a whole bunch of hospitals

[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.200]
I noticed the disappearance

[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.000]
Recently from the fake Jimmy Cifilis

[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.860]
And the fake...

[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.180]
What are some of the other ones?

[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.800]
Greg Budell

[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.300]
Yeah

[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.220]
Larry King

[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.940]
No, Larry King we had yesterday

[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.240]
You're not keeping track of your fakes, Mr. Walter

[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.780]
Well, very well

[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.640]
Speaking of fakers, we got to big-o at two

[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.400]
Can we hear us?

[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.240]
That's the question

[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.660]
I'm so depressed after being down there for four days

[00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.240]
Three or whatever was four days

[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.580]
And realizing how bad the signal really is

[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.100]
I mean, it's like

[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.600]
We're just barely moving the needle on the Richter scale

[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.040]
Yeah

[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.140]
Oh, but don't you worry

[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.900]
We've got the new stick, the new fish stick

[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.080]
And yaddy yaddy yaddy

[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.940]
Mad Dogga Chulis at the four o'clock

[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.840]
Seven to eight we got off in the night

[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.560]
The worst tune out in the history of broadcasting

[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.320]
Eight to eleven its DA who's still hanging on

[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.180]
He is still hanging on

[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.540]
I hear the nighttime signal is really something special

[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.140]
I didn't hear that

[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.000]
You know what I did here?

[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.940]
I give up

[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.420]
I've heard about five minutes

[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.580]
Now, you know, five minutes isn't enough time to judge a show

[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.040]
But I heard five minutes of the highly touted

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.920]
What's all his name, Dan LaBanz to show?

[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.600]
Oh, oh yeah

[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.700]
You talk about sophomoreique juvenile garbage

[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.860]
I have never heard such silly, silly-ass crap

[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.260]
And I'm not big on silly, you know?

[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.020]
No?

[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.640]
No, I'm not big on silly

[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.940]
I like funny, but silly ain't funny

[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.080]
Silly is trying to be funny and not being it

[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.060]
Oh my god, that is the worst shmit I have heard in a long time

[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.820]
It was good, I would tell you, but it was a pathetic

[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.800]
But they make a lot of sounds and a lot of noises and like that

[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.260]
So let's just do that for our save my press

[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.460]
For Thursday, because I won't be here tomorrow

[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.280]
Not here tomorrow, I don't think I'm dead unless you want to

[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.300]
Okay, let's make you feel good

[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.700]
And if my phone rings, I'll be taking a call from Mr. Rutz's name Wang

[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.940]
Yeah

[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.320]
I just need to get something notarized

[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.520]
I don't think he's gonna call me back

[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.640]
It's only like 50 bucks, you know?

[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.220]
Lawyers don't waste their time with that

[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.580]
And by the way, I noticed that Norma, oh boy

[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.100]
I sent him a check after all the begging

[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.760]
Yeah

[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.580]
Not for as much as he probably thought it was gonna be

[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.720]
But for a pretty hefty amount

[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.580]
And I noticed that went through my bank in a heartbeat

[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.180]
Sure

[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.420]
He probably did like a chicken neck walked up and cached it

[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.980]
I don't see any email saying thanks for the check

[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.540]
Or thought you know anything

[00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.640]
As opposed to the other email saying, oh geez, where did you send me a check?

[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.720]
What's going on? Oh, whoa

[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.980]
Oh, and here we go

[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.740]
Hey, Buster, I heard your cost of comments about the bird yesterday

[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.600]
How dare you guess who this is from?

[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.680]
The fake shite dark

[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.100]
Right

[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.640]
When are you gonna let him rest in peace?

[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.240]
I'll say heard your nasty comments about Harry Callis

[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.620]
He was a great broadcaster, shame on you, sir

[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.740]
Yeah, he sucked Harry Callis

[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.280]
One of the all-time worst

[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.260]
Keep the, let's get those emails cranking, baby

[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.020]
Here's one that says you're always sick

[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.660]
Neil, what's up with that?

[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.020]
Doi something

[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.280]
Just uh, I don't know what that is

[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.480]
Doi doi?

[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.760]
No, just one doi, DOEI

[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.860]
Do I, I don't know what it is

[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.820]
Yeah, I'm always sick, I'm an old sick, you know

[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.140]
I tell you what I do get sick is when I get on the plane

[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.480]
I don't know what that's all about

[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.460]
There's recirculated air, so if there's one sick person, everybody gets it

[00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.460]
Oh, I had to get that being

[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.220]
Not so much in recent years, but boy, I got it this time

[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.940]
Going down and then coming back

[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.060]
Oh

[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.860]
Now that's a good excuse, maybe that isn't what I got it

[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.800]
Maybe I just got it from the climate change being down there

[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.180]
The weather was great, it was beautiful

[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.000]
I just saw the same old crap, I didn't see anything new or exciting or different

[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.200]
No

[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.640]
So a lot of really crappy driving, not as bad as here though

[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.040]
Oh, nobody is as bad a driver as they are here, these crazy old Chinese month

[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.980]
Oh, sorry, Mr. Yang, whatever your name is

[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.380]
Wang

[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.820]
Wang

[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.780]
I changed the pole, aren't you proud of me?

[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.280]
Very

[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.220]
Here's the pole from yesterday, I hate this pole, I think it sucked

[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.400]
I got 969 votes if I'd left it on a little longer we'd got 1000

[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.220]
Then they would fear us if we got 1000 votes on a Monday

[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.540]
Would you go to a nudist county, get totally naked

[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.980]
Sure, I've got nothing to hide, 209

[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.400]
And you could be damn sure that those 209 people are people that nobody wants to see naked

[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.120]
Nobody

[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.180]
Now a 2 shy, 174

[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.980]
Now a 2 fat, 130

[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.260]
Only if I could drop some weight and get into shape first, 97

[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.620]
I'd be too afraid of not measuring up to others, 87

[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.620]
I tried at least 177

[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.340]
77

[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:21.980]
WBC

[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.340]
I'd be too afraid of getting turned on, 49

[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.040]
Wow

[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.260]
Anybody who gets turned on by the people who go to nudist counties really is a desperate

[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.320]
There have to be just by the law of averages a couple of good looking people

[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.040]
No, okay

[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.160]
I'm already a nudist 41

[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.840]
Now I'm 2 out of 38

[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.320]
Only if my spouse or lover came with me 26

[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.920]
Only if no one I knew was there 24

[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.680]
Like mom or dad

[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.500]
Or the next door neighbor

[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.660]
My religious beliefs forbid that 17 out of 969 vote

[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.220]
My religious beliefs forbid that

[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.140]
The body is evil and gross

[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.280]
Discuss that's right

[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.680]
Especially the private parts

[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.820]
Says Mr. Wayne

[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.160]
Okay, here's the new pool

[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.280]
The now's down 23 points

[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.320]
I'm, you know, I'm telling you right up front it's going to be a slow show today

[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.760]
I'm not mailing it in, I'm like

[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.100]
Snail mailing it in

[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.340]
Okay, pony expressing it in

[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:20.740]
Yeah

[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.840]
Well, I don't have a lot of energy, you know, this is this is the flu I believe

[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.820]
I'm not one that has ever been able to really tell the difference between a nasty cold and the flu right there with you

[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.320]
Do you know the difference?

[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:40.300]
No, I always say if I feel really bad that must be the flu and if I don't feel so quite, you know, terribly bad then that's cold

[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.620]
Maybe I got to rock in ammonia and the boogie woogie flu

[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.200]
Yep, maybe have to die

[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.720]
Who who we call to that?

[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.900]
I'm telling the second

[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.460]
Rock in ammonia and the boogie woogie flu

[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.020]
Somebody

[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.680]
Okay, here's the new pool

[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.600]
The most overhyped person, place or thing in America is

[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.520]
American Idol 9

[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.680]
The Jonas Brothers 6

[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.400]
Oh my god, you're picking on Joey?

[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.200]
Hey Joey

[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.500]
What's your packin' baby?

[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.700]
Game Marriage 5

[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.400]
The South Beach Scene 5

[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.780]

The Unemployment of Raiden On, the obesity epidemic none

[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.320]
How about the first 31 take?

[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.740]
Who is that?

[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.100]
Johnny?

[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:27.700]
Yes

[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.600]
Is it?

[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.040]
Oh my god

[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.920]
Can you believe it?

[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.400]
It could be the instrumental though

[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.400]
Johnny Rivers on top records I believe

[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.740]
This is just the instrumentalist

[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.720]
Oh yeah, great

[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.560]
It just the notes say instrumental but

[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.320]
Oh wait, it's coming

[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:46.800]
Johnny's coming

[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.580]
He's just a little bit rough

[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.240]
Take him his time

[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.960]
Starts thing is

[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:49.880]
Very

[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.760]
Oh this is somebody writing it

[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.800]
We missed in Dutch, we missed you with the gay parade in South Beach this weekend

[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.240]
Well, I'll still believe

[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.660]
Sticker with the moon, don't shine

[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.400]
Some Dutchman trying to be a smart ass

[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.120]
Okay, some smelly Dutchman with a lot of foreskin

[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:11.760]
Oh

[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.720]
The down is making a comeback, it's only down six points

[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.980]
I predict it's going to be up for at least momentarily

[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.820]
Or not

[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.660]
Do we care?

[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:22.660]
No

[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.620]
A fool in his money are soon parted

[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.200]
Now here's the email of the century

[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.440]
Aren't they all?

[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:31.920]
Sure

[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.780]
From Mike Johnson

[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.100]
You're what?

[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.800]
Mike Johnson

[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.040]
Neil, so I finally broke down and tried bluebell ice cream as it was on sale of my local

[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.160]
Publix 399 and a half gallon normally 599

[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.520]
Wow, what a bargain

[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.180]
I selected the cookie and cream variety and instantly became arosed at the wonderful taste

[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.080]
AROSED arosed

[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.080]
I could then truly say I had one in my mouth once

[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.120]
This is Mike trying to be funny

[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.260]
And illiterate

[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.240]
After work today I'm running out to buy more any other varieties you recommend he asks

[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.840]
I've never had the bluebell ice cream did I ever say I had it?

[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:09.820]
Nothing I recall

[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.820]
No, never had it, don't know nothing about it

[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:13.840]
A lot of people raving about

[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.540]
Maybe one of our zillion of emiors will give you some hot recommendations

[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.320]
To get a rose again

[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.200]
Were you Dutch back in?

[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.800]
Wow, I'm in the White House, the White House, the White River where except this wall is not white anymore

[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.560]
Hey, there's a nice old cow, take it, tear that up

[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.580]
What is made in 1825 mean? Who cares? Where's some paper when you need it?

[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.660]
I got to drop off a steaming pile of chains you can believe in

[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.280]
This will work, it says legislation on it

[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.060]
I'm sure I'm not the first one to fill this with crap

[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.920]
Oh boy, after this I got to break in the first leg and do some presidential humping

[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.260]
Oh wait, mama Obama's tone d'armes, let's go find those

[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.440]
Oh, and note to south, find out where Bill Clinton met by White House bone smug going

[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.560]
Yeah, arse d'armes

[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.200]
Oh boy, oh somebody's got a winner for the pool by the way

[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.120]
Okay, the NFL draft

[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.220]
Adding it now

[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.600]
And what about the White House dog?

[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.180]
Good lord, you mean the Portuguese water dog?

[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.560]
The ugly gross piece of turd

[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:16.760]
Right, you think by now somebody would have sent me some advice about my pink eye and my mucus in the eyes

[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.500]
And what advice?

[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:18.720]

[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.800]
What advice with this cold rock?

[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:20.520]
What advice?

[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.600]
I don't know

[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.820]
Like a bullet to the brain would solve the problem

[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.280]
If I could find my brain

[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:27.740]
I'd be like a black dumb

[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.640]
Maybe I'm sitting on it

[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.880]
NFL draft

[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.560]
Oh, how can you say that?

[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.960]
This is the most important time of the year, right?

[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.880]
Yeah, whatever you say, crazy people, get all whipped up

[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.520]
And you know who's, I'll tell you who's the craziest of them all about this

[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.260]
Rock solid

[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:44.540]
Him

[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.000]
Between that thing that they go to, what are they called a combine?

[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.020]
The NFL combine

[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.660]
Where they measure their biceps and their penis and their cheeks and shirts

[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.180]
All that crap?

[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.340]
Oh, he's big into that

[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.120]
The big

[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:58.360]
Oh!

[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.900]
He'll be on it too this afternoon, I'm sure breathlessly anticipating the NFL draft

[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.080]
And all that hazard ride that's coming up this weekend

[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.340]
Are we preempted on the Friday for that to get ready for it? You would think

[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.020]
All right

[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.820]
I'm looking at the schedule

[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.540]
Now

[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.600]
Now look at that

[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:17.140]
Friday

[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.920]
The big O at Miami Prime

[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.700]
And then four to seven gym medics in Joe Rose and Bow at Miami Prime

[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.140]
And then all of a sudden at seven we got U.M. Virginia Take Baseball

[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:34.060]
To bring our screeching halt to all the draft for play

[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:40.680]
But then on Saturday boy on draft, we got Geltie and Josie and Danny Canal and Bowd

[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.860]
Bowkamper and Oh!

[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.140]
And

[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.020]
Now here's something I don't understand

[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:48.940]
All right

[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.580]
And ordinarily I don't pay any attention to the weekend schedule and either there's anybody else

[00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.720]
Four to eight Saturday the NFL draft now you know I want to ask you a question

[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.720]
I'm going to give you some of the names on here Joe Rose, Jim Maddich, Orlando at Dolphin Stadium

[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:10.060]
I guess who else is listed here who works for another radio station?

[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.560]
Josh Friedman

[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.060]
No, sit Rosenberg

[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.740]
The voice of the dolphins Jimmy, Cifalus

[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.420]
How is that possible?

[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:26.120]
Well you understand that it really isn't a separate radio station

[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.280]
What are you talking about?

[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.240]
He's an IOD he's not across all that oh I'm sorry you're right you're right sorry I give them all to you

[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.000]
He's not across the street on the shuttle bus what are you talking about?

[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.300]
He's going to be on our coverage

[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.400]
That lousy that turd that screamer you fat oh my god

[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.400]
Jimmy Cifalus I guess that's because he does the games you know

[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:55.560]
Makes no sense to me none but then again we have no shame we'll put anybody on

[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.720]
That's why they're talking to sit the kid about doing two to four

[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.540]
Maybe they're talking to sit the kid about doing ten to two

[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:09.320]
Write a check write a check I've begun so fast you'll never even know I was here

[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:09.880]
That's funny

[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.020]
I'm counting that's what they ought to do

[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.820]
Because you know in the worst possible way they want to sports you on here in midday

[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.920]
Yep, forget the fact we've had the highest numbers on the station for 11 and a half years

[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.720]
Forget about that you know what your boss says it's not about ratings Hank

[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.860]
It's about ratings it's about firing everybody and especially the Jews

[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:39.400]
I ain't Jewish Lee Cutler what about him remember I was asking you yesterday yes the sales guy

[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:46.000]
And did they is he the guy they brought back I know I have to say he was trying to tell me he didn't know the guy's name

[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:54.940]
I have not seen Lee Cutler lately you know who that is remember we should have temper tantrums in the sales room and bang on the walls

[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.860]
No no I don't remember in our little studio was right next door to his orifice

[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:04.300]
No I remember that no I remember they named a ridge after him oh this must be a hold on what Mr. Wang

[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.560]
Is a funny first name too

[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.440]
That you should share with the audience

[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:33.740]
Okay now I got good news and bad news yeah the good news is Mr. Wang is going to be available to see me

[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:51.360]
I'm going to be bailing out a few minutes early okay now I did I did bail out for three minutes yesterday but I thought I came back pretty fat

[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:56.620]

He says blue bell tropical paradise gives me a Booner BUNER R

[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:50.000]
See something sometimes yeah sometimes making a little typo is good because if you wouldn't have made the typo I couldn't have read it

[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.640]
Correct right but a Booner sure what a mooner

[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.740]
Booner well I'm a little choked up

[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:03.620]
I think I'm making a comeback I don't know and let me just give you the report the follow up on the sorbet hall and the oxygen

[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.000]
Halls mental looked like oh yeah how do I at all come out oh it sure did

Uh-huh whoa

[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:17.480]
And took about an hour and a half what I've discovered with the sugar-free stuff the sorbet hall stuff is that you can have a you know like one or two

[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:23.100]
And that's fine but there's a critical mass that once you reach it. Oh I love you so critical mass it explode my ass

Yeah, it also had lots of gas

[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.100]
That was kind of embarrassing because I don't know about you, but I'm just not really big on farting in the presence of other people

[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.280]
Yeah, right and

Somebody needs to be murdered whoever put that show on here, but anyway, so as he was leaving I was farting you know

[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.060]
I'm uncontrollably farting

[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.620]

He was says I never emailed you but had to ask you there was a book report by a Richard Pactor

[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.200]
His name is Max.

[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.580]
I

[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.180]

Pushing Wang

[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.120]

[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.180]
What other kind of Wang is there as a Pishing Wang

[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:17.860]
I

[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.620]
Don't know why you find that so easy

[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:27.100]
He's a Chinese name is a funny and he's not smelly either. He's not a smelly Chinese mom. He's like you know a guy

[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.420]
Let's have some trouble. I

[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:33.980]
Black he says I can't help but laugh every time I hear the name Wang. He reminds me of the movie Kettyshack

[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:42.300]
Wang was Rodney Dangerfield's driver in the movie he told Wang when they arrived at Bushwood that this place was restricted and don't tell them your Jewish

[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.580]
Classic is blackie

[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.760]
Remember a Wang being Rodney Dangerfield's driver. Yes, I don't

[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:54.900]
You know how many years ago how many hundred years ago I saw that 100 Kettyshack

[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.360]
Oh, you don't sound too good. No, it'll time to go home

[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.020]
Wow

[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:08.340]

[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:13.680]
No, I'm not you're not always sick anymore than I'm always sick, but you're always sick and that

[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:19.780]
I mean it was a period of time when I first came up here and it was the sinus thing remember that? Mm-hmm

[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:06.340]
And the guys right up the street and you know, it's just how far as you know how much it costs in Canada. Maybe it's different up there

[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.440]
Go ahead. Yeah, that's what I said

[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.660]
Wang yeah

[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:05.520]

At the food court at the hard rock yeah, they have an ice cream joint okay, and they have the best hot fudge Sundays on chocolate ice cream

[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.920]
You know, I mean just with whipped cream, you know, and a little maraschino cherry

[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.640]
I mean obviously send my blood sugar soaring just

[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.300]
Insane, but boy, they're really good

[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:31.660]
Sounds good. Don't like hot fudge Sundays very much what are you talking about on chocolate ice cream? Yeah, yeah

[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.520]
Life is around

[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.120]
See, that's one thing Mickey D's does wrong and once in a while I'll give you know

[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.420]
I'll be horny for one and little hot fudge Sundays, so there's but they use that vanilla

[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.760]
Whatever it is not really ice cream. What do you call that? So I'm talking about DQ

[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:51.840]
No, I'm talking about Mickey D's oh, oh DQ. They don't have ice cream. No, they have soft serve softly. They're honest about it

[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.700]
They don't know how that's great. All that server's hard yesterday. I sure served up a lot of soft serve. Oh

[00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.780]
Tastes degrees

[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.400]
It's a good thing I stayed close to home though. I've learned my lesson

[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:09.180]
Johnny dark is back. He says crazy Mario question mark. You should only be so lucky

[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:15.600]
But it whatever that means I'm sick of your attacks on great local broadcasters. Give it a rest already

[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.460]
Harry Callis had a style similar to sunny Hirsch

[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.180]
Oh, my god. What's he talking about

[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.700]
You continue to turn on everyone

[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.420]
George was caustic for months and then wonders why Joe Bell wants to replace him

[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.400]
He gives no effort to your show, but then comes to

[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.460]
Comes alive when all of a sudden when he hosts

[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:35.980]
Coincidence

[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.100]
Yeah, when he hosts he's supposed to be the

[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:43.520]
I'm supposed to talk in a lot I imagine that's right. He's supposed to be the mood driver and shaker

[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.300]
Supposed to be moving it and shaking it

[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.620]
Johnny and could be the real Johnny dork. He's a you know, he's a jackass could be him, but it's very all

[00:33:54.100 --> 00:34:00.120]
You should be so lucky who else would say that besides crazy Mario. I don't know from Mario sir

[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.320]
You want I don't know from Mario

[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.620]
Yeah, you do he's the one with the death threat

[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:10.100]
Oh, we're back in the early stages of the yes emails. Yeah

[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:15.680]
And then Joyce's response that will need a lot of me doing something about that

[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.000]
Yeah

[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.240]
I'm gonna tell you something

[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.040]
The whole business with Ken Maulden

[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:28.460]
Has got me so upset. I mean there are no words to describe it even though the sun just came out here finally

[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:33.660]
After rain for 28 hours, but nevertheless, and just it's unacceptable

[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:39.440]
Why is it that the good people in this world get screwed over badly badly

[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:43.820]
They get the shaft because the evil people are the ones doing the screwing that's true

[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.460]
Very jackass is sorry about that usually jikers the one with the old material

[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.300]
Everyone seems to be wrapped up about this weekend. I'm not

[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.140]

143 votes on the pool and American idols winning hands down your pants most overhyped

[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.420]
Now what was that show that the Susan Boyle was on was that the British?

[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:58.420]
The British version of American I guess British Idol and is that why Simon Cowell is on that one too

[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.560]

[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:09.540]
Moody mean by that Westlife was great. Well that they're his baby. He was the big papa of Westlife

[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:14.520]
He assembled them they were they were great. I don't hear nothing from them no more, but then again

[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.240]

[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:50.640]
They're great see ya since he's so maybe he'll have to rewrite what that or that is because it's chopped off

[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.680]
It's FOU something to mention

[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:58.360]
Let's do something about these chopped off emails on the right hand side there they're they're all chopped off

Steeces they have a talk station in Vegas that is the stronger signal in Nevada and they're doing fractions in the ratings fractions

[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.760]
Instead of the wall of football kdwn is doing it with news weather and traffic and Michael's savage

Never been kissed by man. Let me ask you why would you tell anybody something like that

[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.980]
Listen if not for her look and her tragic story

[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.780]
She would not be getting all his attention and make up

[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:17.880]
Oh, but she sings so wonderful and she's from Scotland. Oh, she's so wonderful

[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:21.700]
She looks like a money python character now that yeah, exactly. That's why I did that

[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.160]
Here's one from my can hollywood my 40th birthday was a couple weeks ago

Who stood behind a quick hit machine she wasn't playing she just stood behind you

[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.320]
And she's just giving everybody advice. I guess she's the quick hit advisor

[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.120]

Strange and smelly I didn't I didn't encounter any smelly people in the casinos down there

[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.020]
Isn't that good good see I said something good about South Carolina

[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:04.680]

Certain things you never expect to come out of a person's mouth

[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.960]
Why can't you ever just keep your big mouth shut

[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:07.140]

[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:41.580]
Oh

[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.160]
It's hard to talk and keep it

[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.420]
How about I sit on your kinky face for a while while you think about that

[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:04.300]
Oh

[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:07.040]
Take a little bit shake him round the bed

[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.280]
Make him do a flip then squeeze

[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:16.300]
Take a little bit shake him round the bed make him do a flip then squeeze

[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.180]
I'm saying, oh my God, I'm awesome.

[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:28.160]
I'll tell you one thing, speaking of awesome, that flea, he's the hell of a guy, even though

[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:28.960]
he does want your job.

[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:30.440]
No, he doesn't.

[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:31.380]
No, he denies it.

[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:31.940]
Right.

[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.680]
I mean, what's he going to say?

[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:35.860]
Right?

[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:39.180]
Is he going to say, oh yeah, I'm trying to stand my good friend Georgian to back and take

[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:39.800]
over his job?

[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.080]
Never should not have to say that.

[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:41.720]
I believe in no.

[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.420]
I believe in two.

[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:43.600]
Well, good.

[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.900]
Well, why didn't you tell me that thing about Joe Bell before the show this morning?

[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:47.220]
I can't.

[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.420]
That is so typical and so grotesque.

[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:50.080]
Flip my mind.

[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.600]
I was busy doing with that spot and done.

[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:52.620]
Not a funny man.

[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:53.740]
Not a funny guy.

[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.540]
Funny to look at, but not a funny guy.

[00:45:56.100 --> 00:46:01.240]
And like I've always said, there's nothing worse than somebody trying to be funny who's

[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:01.420]
not.

[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.300]
That's Joe Bell.

[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.180]
Flea says today I have scheduled a giveaway just for online listeners.

[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:12.200]
Sometimes, during the new hour, we'll give away a pair of tickets to the He-Hawks game

[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:12.660]
on Monday.

[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.480]
There'll be a cue to call that'll play in the new hour online.

[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:16.360]
Right.

[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:18.880]
That's pretty good.

[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:19.900]
Yes, it is.

[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.380]
We're actually doing something for the people listening online.

[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.220]
Nice going, Flea.

[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:26.560]
Aren't you shocked?

[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:28.280]
Not by him, no.

[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.560]
Now we're actually doing something for our people.

[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:35.940]
No, because it's his idea and he's doing it.

[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:36.820]
He likes this show.

[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:42.960]
Here's one from Ubidubi who says you moved to Toronto because you like the people there.

[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:43.760]
Question mark.

[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:48.800]
Toronto is a cesspool of the worst immigrants in the most backward third world countries

[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.580]
all over the world.

[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.260]
A rank rotten simmering powder keg just waiting to go off.

[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.660]
Yeah, I don't disagree with that.

[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.100]
So what about it?

[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.540]
Toronto is a cesspool.

[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.280]
Can you believe that?

[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:02.160]
Anybody would say that?

[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.560]
Well, I've never been there.

[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.620]
So this is one of the great cities of the world.

[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:05.980]
OK.

[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.980]
And the fact that there's a lot of the worst immigrants from the most, that's because

[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.940]
immigration here, they like those people.

[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.340]
If you look like a terrorist, come on in.

[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.160]
Welcome to Canada.

[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.340]
That's the freaking truth.

[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.440]
If you look like a clean, shaving, clean cut kind of like average a Joe or Jane or whatever.

[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:27.440]
Oh, let's put you in the secondary screening and put you through living hell like they

[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.940]
did to me that one time coming back from Europe.

[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.020]
Oh my god.

[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.940]
Have you ever stolen a freight train?

[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:33.780]
Can you prove it?

[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:39.840]
But if you got like a beard and you got like something attached to your around your waist,

[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.700]
it looks like a suicide bomber's a gear.

[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.240]
Welcome to Canada.

[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:45.300]
That's true.

[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.240]
So whatever you say, I'm doing fine.

[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.100]
I like it.

[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.100]
Johnny Dark is back.

[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.200]
Subject you're sick.

[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.220]
But this isn't what you think.

[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:54.940]
OK.

[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:00.440]
As much as I don't like how you treat my fellow radio people, I don't want you to go.

[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.300]
Take care of yourself.

[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:02.840]
You old fart.

[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.760]
I'm worried about you.

[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.080]
You sound terrible.

[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.600]
It's not terrible because I got a bad cold or the flu or something.

[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:07.920]
OK.

[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.980]
I'm not sure what a lot of us would do without the sound of your voice on the radio.

[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.020]
If we never see each other again, goodbye old cout.

[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.380]
Thanks for the years of great radio.

[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.860]
I've enjoyed our love, hey, relationship over the years.

[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:22.500]
Johnny.

[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.880]
I do think that's the real Johnny dark.

[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:25.520]
Of course not.

[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:28.640]
You don't know.

[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:29.820]
But it was nice.

[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.340]
So we're touching.

[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:32.800]
Are you touching it?

[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:33.720]
No.

[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.420]
I think he was in my condition.

[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.160]
You think it sounds like Johnny is.

[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:37.780]
Oh, yeah.

[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.860]
Oh, God, the thought of it.

[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.060]
I wouldn't even know where to find it.

[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:46.780]
Maybe I'll ask Mr. Wang for directions.

[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:51.300]
He's a real ugly guy, by the way.

[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:55.520]
You know, a lot of the Chinese guys are really very, very hot, but he's not one of them.

[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:55.720]
OK.

[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.100]
He's a man.

[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:57.900]
In fact, maybe he's not Chinese.

[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.120]
Maybe he's, yeah, that sounds.

[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.240]
Could he be Japanese with a name like that or Chinese Chinese?

[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.660]
Now how do you know because your daughter went to Japan, right?

[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.160]
So how do you know about the first of all?

[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.060]
I know that Chinese name, Chinese name.

[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.480]
Second of all, Japanese names don't sound like that.

[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.560]
They sound like ito.

[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.900]
I always sound like ito and things like that.

[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:19.620]
Ito?

[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:20.640]
Short syllables.

[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:21.860]
Like Judge Ito.

[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:22.640]
Right.

[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:23.860]
He was Japanese.

[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:25.960]
He was a turd.

[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.380]
They played him like a strativarius, like an old fiddle.

[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:33.320]
Yeah.

[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:34.620]
Here's one.

[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.900]
It says, how about opening the phones to get people's take on US Cuba relations?

[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:38.480]
No.

[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.380]
I'm not opening the phones to get anybody's take on anything.

[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.280]
You know, how many months it's been since I've taken a call?

[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:43.860]
100.

[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:45.520]
Thank God.

[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.180]
I'd love to hear who Cuba's going to take in the third round.

[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:52.640]
Just kidding, of course, but it'll make sense considering that that's all that's being

[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:55.380]
talked about this week on the station, the draft sucks.

[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:56.100]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:58.360]
Sorry to hear your feeling like crap.

[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.380]
I called George once last week into the great job says CT.

[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.100]
Well, thanks CT.

[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:05.660]
Yeah.

[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:06.400]
Thanks.

[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.360]
Scott and panelists, parks, has dysphelialized that most of the online listeners don't live

[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.380]
in South Florida and can't get to the game.

[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.200]
You know, that's an interesting point.

[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:18.420]
But I don't know about most, but some do and it's for them.

[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:19.460]
That's right.

[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:21.420]
It's the ones who listen online in South Florida.

[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.360]
Or the ones who can get there.

[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:22.940]
Scott, right.

[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:26.240]
And it seemed to me that if you were a big fan and they got free tickets, you could drive

[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:30.980]
all the way down to South Florida, drive down to the Mickey, I've stepped to Mickey Arena

[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:34.960]
as much as they might like us to make prizes available that are, you know, for something's

[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.960]
going on in their community.

[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:36.980]
You know, we live here.

[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:38.560]
You do.

[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:40.040]
Yeah.

[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:40.800]
Better you than me.

[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:43.600]
If you, I find her.

[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.000]
Then are you than me?

[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:50.780]
Today is a big day at Duncan Donuts.

[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.240]
You know that?

[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:55.480]
I should have done this at the start, but it got shuffled down in toward the bottom of

[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:55.960]
my pile.

[00:50:56.260 --> 00:51:01.780]
He would normally, here, here's one near the bottom and deservedly so.

[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:06.600]
Says George and Fleet did a great last week, even with an on-stop paraded drive by ass

[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.040]
clowns and closets, sport holes says, Mark and West Palm.

[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.340]
What he means by that, I have no idea.

[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:16.500]
Did you have a non-stop paraded drive by ass clowns and closets, sport holes?

[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.360]
I don't know about the closets, sport holes.

[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.700]
You know, the ass clowns are always there.

[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:20.580]
No.

[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:23.360]
Although it took a while to catch up.

[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:28.340]
Took them a while to catch up with like Wednesday before they really started in

[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:28.500]
heavy.

[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:29.540]
We're going to tell you folks something.

[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:34.200]
You better get those damn emails in if I'm going to make it to 145 because it's pretty

[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:34.960]
slim and grim.

[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.120]
Really slim what's coming in here so far.

[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:41.440]
How's the Dow doing?

[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:42.380]
Not good.

[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:43.300]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.800]
The S&P is up three and a half points.

[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.900]
That means the Dow might be doing okay.

[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:48.480]
What do you think?

[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:48.780]
Okay.

[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.180]
What do you think as Lee Fowler would say?

[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.320]
Does anybody care?

[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:54.080]
No.

[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.480]
What are the things around anymore?

[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.420]
Dow is up 12 and a half points and I tell you that Dow would be up before the day

[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.140]
was out tonight at least briefly and I say that?

[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:02.480]
Yes.

[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:04.680]
That's why psychic powers, man.

[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:05.740]
My psychotic powers.

[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.460]
Still haven't heard from the lovely Maria with those bags under her eyes.

[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.480]
I got pink eye in both eyes.

[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:12.980]
Wow.

[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:13.440]
Nice.

[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.260]
You wake up.

[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.440]
Their eyes are sealed shut and crushed.

[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.320]
Just about the left eye.

[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:18.620]
Bad.

[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:24.440]
The last two mornings with all kinds of gunk and oh, you got to do like a special cleaning

[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.640]
operation on the eye, you know.

[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:27.660]
Right.

[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:28.960]
What is that?

[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.080]
Is that the colder flu?

[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:32.420]
It's pink eye or death.

[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.840]
Pink eye is what?

[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:34.620]
What is pink eye?

[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:37.740]
Pink eye is when you get some sort of an infection or bacteria.

[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:39.380]
I'm not sure what causes it in your eye.

[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:43.500]
So you get a lot of mucus flowing out into your eye.

[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.700]
What does it have to do with all the mucus in my throat?

[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.520]
Maybe something.

[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:51.020]
Maybe nothing.

[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:51.440]
I don't know.

[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:52.340]
Ask a doctor.

[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.160]
Ask Mr. Wang.

[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.360]
Mr. Wang don't know.

[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:57.120]
Maybe he knows some ancient Chinese medicine.

[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.700]
Maybe he knows some ancient Chinese secrets.

[00:52:58.920 --> 00:52:59.000]
That's right.

[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.320]
Maybe he's going to do some acupuncture.

[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:01.480]
Stick it in your eye.

[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:01.960]
I don't think he's going to be able to.

[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.740]
He's got a big meeting between two and four.

[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.060]
That's why I got to get out of here early.

[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.600]
I'm not doing it to be a slacker.

[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.620]
I'm just doing it because that's the only time he can see me.

[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:13.080]
And where do you think I'm going after Mr. Wang?

[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:13.740]
I don't know.

[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:14.160]
Woodbind.

[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.840]
Well, I'm going with my cabbie.

[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:18.880]
So I'm going to be in the cab.

[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.420]
Might as well go, you know.

[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:20.960]
Right.

[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:25.800]
You got to come back real fast and fact something to somebody and then I'll be back in that

[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.420]
cab again.

[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:28.220]
I'll end up on the road again.

[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:30.840]
Got to make back the money.

[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:31.660]
I lost down there.

[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:33.380]
Well, I took a beating.

[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:34.580]
Digit in.

[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:35.400]
Yeah.

[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.860]
Anyway, today is iced coffee day at Duncan Donuts.

[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:42.480]
Now do they spend any money on the station or not?

[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:48.000]
Because every once in a while I get suckered into promoting something for somebody that don't

[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:48.640]
give a squad.

[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.320]
But they used to.

[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:53.940]
They used to bring us those short stacks.

[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.000]
Remember those days?

[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:56.340]
Sure.

[00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.440]
If we're difficult, pissed them off and chased them away.

[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.120]
See, I get accused of chasing everybody way.

[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.640]
It's default who chases everybody, when including the audience.

[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:08.440]
I just Larry King and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:09.940]
I'm looking at the white whale.

[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:10.960]
It is all silly.

[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.940]
You work with a guy named Holly Salon.

[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.800]
I thought you didn't believe in torture.

[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:16.640]
I'm a butcher.

[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:17.540]
Watch out for that.

[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.200]
What do you do here?

[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.540]
I'm a political advisor.

[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:22.840]
This is the part of the world where friendship matters.

[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:26.000]
My sisters go to work to meet you.

[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.440]
The brothers of awareness.

[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:31.640]
The movement that was the worst of the evil of the major to the sea on the day.

[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:33.260]
Light is on you.

[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.060]
You will be the worst of the evil.

[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:37.060]
You know what it lacks the Middle East, buddy?

[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:38.840]
And that's the problem right there.

[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:42.060]
Yeah, maybe that's the problem right there, the way that ended.

[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.480]
What just happened?

[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:44.460]
It just ended.

[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.480]
I guess they ran out of ideas.

[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:49.160]
That was really the end?

[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:50.520]
Wait a minute.

[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.040]
Yeah, I guess that was it.

[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.240]
Well, strange, strange.

[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:55.600]
But anyway.

[00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:57.680]
Hey, how?

[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.580]
Somebody used to say, hey, how?

[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:03.860]
1118 at 560 WQAM.

[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:08.980]
Boy, I'm telling you if I could just take a scooper, a pooper scooper or something and scoop

[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:09.800]
out all the flim.

[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:16.380]
You can't just discuss it so many times over years about flim and flim dust and crap

[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:16.820]
like that.

[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:19.260]
And I'm one of those people.

[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:22.840]
I don't want to get a whole big bunch out, you know, up in my throat.

[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:23.860]
I don't want to swallow it.

[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:24.940]
Right.

[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:26.080]
That's yucky.

[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:26.980]
Yeah.

[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:29.560]
And I'm afraid it's going to go back where it came from, which is not correct.

[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:30.900]
Right, but it'll make you a gag.

[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:31.820]
It's nasty anyway.

[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:32.820]
Is it?

[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.820]
But I don't think it's bad for you.

[00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:38.900]
It's just it's just I don't know, but it's just gross.

[00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:40.540]
Maybe I have flim for lunch today.

[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:41.500]
It's a low carb.

[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:41.800]
Why not?

[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:42.040]
Yeah.

[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:49.920]
Somebody Waltz is maybe the whole Somali pirates scenario is a huge overnight that

[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:50.980]
qualifies for today's poll.

[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:51.400]
What do you think?

[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:52.360]
Sure, why not?

[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.460]
Somali pirate, whatever.

[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.240]
Yeah, this whole business about pirates.

[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.940]
I mean, you know, I think there've been two damn many Johnny Depp movies.

[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:02.620]
That's what I think.

[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:05.000]
I like Johnny a lot, but too many of those movies.

[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.080]
You see a pirate shoot him.

[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:15.740]
Like they they they dignify these people like suicide bombers.

[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:18.380]
I mean, is there something legitimate about suicide bombers?

[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:18.700]
Nope.

[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:24.500]
Crazy people dangerous people really dangerous like most of the people in my

[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:27.660]
building here like that one fact said that email whatever was.

[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.500]
Jim DeFeedus grew Susan Boyle.

[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.780]
That's coming to a theater near you soon.

[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.160]
Wow.

[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:38.880]
Jimmy does Susan.

[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.020]
Yeah, freak show productions.

[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:41.200]
Presenters Puerto Rican.

[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.360]
I'll round pink.

[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:44.580]
I'll ride conjunctivitis.

[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:47.360]
Says me a whole thing here.

[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:51.760]
Which is kind of a music because I just looked it up on the just Google it.

[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:55.040]
Yeah, but he's got a much better thing here than I do.

[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.400]
Thanks PR Ralph.

[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:01.360]
Baron fits repeats.

[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.540]
Blue, this is the third time he sent it and he still keeps spelling it the same way.

[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:09.560]
Blue Bell tropical paradise gives me a Booner BUNER BUNER.

[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.660]
Must be really good that huh?

[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:14.220]
I know.

[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:17.800]
I'm not in the market for ice cream these days.

[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:20.220]
I'm trying to phase myself out of the ice cream market.

[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:22.020]
Do you think that's a good idea?

[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.440]
Yeah, get you a nice shallad and pretend it's ice cream.

[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.260]
Oh, a shallad?

[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:26.820]
Yes.

[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:28.620]
Where's martiala when we need him?

[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:29.660]
Not that kind of shallad.

[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.820]
A nice leafy shallad.

[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:34.140]
Some lettuce.

[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:35.660]
Oh, it's finished.

[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:36.720]
Fui.

[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:41.120]
What is a pink eye infection conjunctivitis?

[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:42.220]
Pink eye or conjunctivitis?

[00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:44.340]
This is a common IAL mint that's affected many of us.

[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:48.920]
It's caused by infection or inflammation of the conjunctiva.

[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:55.320]
Pink eyes usually brought about either by bacteria or viral or numerous allergic factors.

[00:57:56.580 --> 00:58:00.500]
Although pink eyes not a serious eye disease, the bacterial cause needs to be treated because

[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:02.580]
the symptoms don't go away without proper treatment.

[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:06.840]
And this variant of conjunctivitis can be passed down to other people just by coming into

[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:08.620]
contact with the exact identical items.

[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:10.620]
What does that mean?

[00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:11.260]
I don't know.

[00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:14.900]
Conjunctivitis usually looks very bad on first diagnosis.

[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:18.300]
This is the eye can turn very red, but the worst part is usually the irritation and the

[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:18.620]
itchiness.

[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:20.860]
I don't have like a bad case, a bad dose.

[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:27.420]
In fact, it's less pink right now than it was yesterday and the eye too.

[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:33.260]
Pink eye results in redness, irritation, and inflammation of the conjunctiva.

[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:37.760]
The conjunctiva is the thin membrane that covers the white portion of the eyes as well as

[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.900]
the inner surface of the eyelids.

[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:44.140]
Conjunctivitis usually reacts to bacteria, viruses, allergy, allergy causing

[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:44.380]
medium.

[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:45.360]
It's allergies, man.

[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:45.900]
All right.

[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:48.660]
Or diseases of some parts of the body.

[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.480]
Viral conjunctiva, that may this goes on forever.

[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:59.240]
Induced by viruses that spread from various ailments like colds, sore throats, respiratory

[00:58:59.240 --> 00:58:59.660]
infections.

[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.180]
And other than that's what I got, it's a bad cold.

[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:01.700]
That's all.

[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.260]
What are you getting all excited about?

[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.160]
The Christ shakes.

[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:07.800]
Jesus, God Almighty.

[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:10.480]
Jesus Christ, Solomon and Moses, and Abraham.

[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.900]
This pink eye contagious.

[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:16.560]
The bacterial and viral pink eyes contagious, but allergic pink eyes not.

[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:20.360]
It can be hard to tell which is present, but allergic pink eye usually goes

[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:24.460]
away after a short amount of time when irritation, the irritant agent is removed and the

[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:25.160]
eyes rinse out.

[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:26.560]
When it down, I'm going to go rinse it out.

[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:30.680]
I'm going to go during the commercial break and rinse out my eyes.

[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:30.940]
Sure.

[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:32.840]
Do you have any, you, a bison or anything like that?

[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:33.080]
No.

[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:35.760]
No God.

[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:38.560]
Maybe I could, there's a drug store not too far from here.

[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:39.660]
Well, get some while you're out.

[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:44.260]
No, I was thinking of doing what I did yesterday.

[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:45.700]
I wouldn't be back quite as fast.

[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:50.040]
People who contract pink eye just by touching or using another article that's been

[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.620]
infected by personalized the eye infection.

[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:55.640]
For a simple illustration, a personalized pink eye whose rubbed his eyes used that hand to

[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:59.620]
open a door or used an object near the eye like eye makeup or eye drops could end up

[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:03.260]
infecting someone else who touches the aforementioned door or uses the same object in their eye,

[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:03.940]
eye, eye, eye.

[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:09.340]
This is why it encouraged that people more often kids who are diagnosed with pink eye should stay

[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:12.960]
home until the infection is cured to avoid giving the infection to other people.

[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.300]
Well, I sure hope I don't give it to a paco.

[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.260]
He'll be wild, just psychotic.

[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.220]
I got it from you.

[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.100]
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.000]
Crazy person.

[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:23.540]
I don't think so.

[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:27.680]
Pink eye medication can be a mix of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines.

[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:33.080]
For bacterial infections, a doctor must prescribe pink eye antibiotic to attack the bacteria.

[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.040]
This can be delivered in varieties like eye drops, or I'm instead applied to the eyes for a few days.

[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:42.100]
Pattenol is one solution that's been proven about buh, buh, buh, buh, and it's got a list of other crap.

[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:46.880]
This goes on for like four pages here.

[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.720]
But then it'll go away.

[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:51.220]
Always does.

[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:51.960]
I haven't had it before.

[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:52.720]
Have any of you had pink eye?

[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:53.300]
Sure.

[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.540]
Then what did you do?

[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:57.280]
Eye drops until it goes away.

[01:00:58.900 --> 01:00:59.520]
Eye drops.

[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.420]
Yeah, I mean, it's just a symptom thing.

[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.260]
You wash your eyes in the morning because there's all that crud there.

[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.820]
So you get a warm washcloth and wash them out.

[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:12.260]
You keep eye drops in there to try to keep them from crushing up for the rest of the day.

[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.060]
I'll tell you one thing.

[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:15.000]
For the next two hours, I've got to be washing my eyes.

[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:16.800]
Just wash it.

[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:19.520]
Before I go see Mr. Wang.

[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:20.100]
Right.

[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.000]
Oh my god.

[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:24.980]
Jorge.

[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:27.280]
Hey, the different or hey,

[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.060]
human George sends me a long email.

[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.260]
I got to print this baby out.

[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:33.560]
Wow.

[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.360]
I don't know if this is going to be or three.

[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:38.660]
You're not.

[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:39.640]
It'll kill some good time though.

[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.400]
And seeing it has how it's not even 1130.

[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.740]
At the thousand fifty two points.

[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:46.300]
Told you, pirate suspect goes to court.

[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.280]
He's laughing and showed his ass.

[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:48.640]
Okay.

[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:49.820]
Shoot him right on TV.

[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.600]
Blow his fricking brains out if you can find out where he's hiding him.

[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:54.360]
Oh, you.

[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.900]
You're listening to Neil Vajor.

[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:56.660]
Pirate my ass.

[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:57.780]
Neil.

[01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:58.440]
God.

[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:03.140]
At last, the new book from the late best-selling author Michael Crighton.

[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.380]
500 pages of nothing.

[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.520]
After Michael passed away,

[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:12.260]
publisher scoured his office and found 500 thrilling sheets of blank pages

[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.960]
bound tightly in one room, unedited and raw.

[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.400]
And now the critics are raving.

[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.420]
The New York Times exclaims amazing.

[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:26.640]
The pages may be blank, but you can't help but try and grasp the incredible symbolism.

[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:31.260]
Time magazine says 500 pages of nothing is beyond comprehension.

[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:34.540]
And the first Michael Crighton book you can finish in a day.

[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:39.500]
You won't be able to put it down next to the other stacks of paper and hope to find it again.

[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.860]
500 pages of nothing.

[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.560]
You can't say you haven't seen everything Michael Crighton hasn't finished

[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.100]
until you haven't read his latest novel.

[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.620]
Every true fan must buy this book.

[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:52.180]
For 49.95.

[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.420]
Wait till you hear this email from Cuban George.

[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.080]
I'll get to it.

[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.280]
But first, guess what I found?

[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:03.400]
Pink eye.

[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.540]
No, guess what I found in the medicine cabinet.

[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:07.740]
Byzine.

[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.180]
Polly Sporen.

[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.780]
I slash eardrops.

[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.960]
Oh, I an eardrops.

[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:13.500]
That'll be good.

[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.780]
Now, how I don't understand how that works?

[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.840]
How can I and eardrops be the same?

[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.600]
Um, I don't know.

[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:26.760]
Because they're close to each other.

[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:28.440]
Because it's a cleaning solution.

[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:29.280]
I see.

[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.360]
I just glorified water.

[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.140]
You will as soon as you squirt that stuff in there.

[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.420]
Nixon says I'm not trying to be funny here,

[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.960]
but squeezing the dropper to have lemon juice in the artwork for me instantly.

[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:37.620]
Ah!

[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.780]
For me, it'll hurt his health, but the highly effective.

[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:40.520]
Go ahead and try it.

[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:42.220]
I don't have any lemons and I wouldn't do it anyway.

[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.020]
Yeah, somebody's going to write,

[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.380]
well, put some battery acid in there.

[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.300]
That'll clean it all out.

[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:48.500]
Lemon juice.

[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:49.360]
Can you imagine that?

[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:50.760]
I don't want to.

[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.860]
Why don't you just take the lemon rind and squeeze that into your eye?

[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.540]
This expires February 2010,

[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.620]
so this has still got a good almost a year on it.

[01:03:59.160 --> 01:03:59.520]
Yeah.

[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:01.940]
So let me squeeze a couple of drops.

[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:02.920]
Let's do it on the air.

[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:05.640]
Okay, well, I eat this grilled chicken from KFC.

[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:09.380]
You got free food in there again?

[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.500]
Yeah, they got the new grilled chicken.

[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:13.360]
And there's a pretty good station with it.

[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:14.360]
Well, let me try this.

[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:15.620]
Oh, um.

[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:17.380]
Uh.

[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:25.100]
Oh.

[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:26.060]
Well, I got some on my cheek.

[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:26.700]
That was good.

[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:30.920]
Oh, I don't think I got any of my eye though.

[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.500]
Maybe I need to go into, uh, huh?

[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.060]
There's a trick that you're supposed to do.

[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:34.580]
What's the trick?

[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.380]
You taught your head back.

[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.860]
Yeah, close your eyes.

[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:42.360]
Put a couple of drops in the corner of your eye,

[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.640]
the put the side of your eye closes to your nose.

[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.240]
While your eyes are closed.

[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:48.100]
Yeah.

[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.200]
And then blink.

[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.220]
Good work, George.

[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:03.460]
An opt, uh, a night doctor taught me that for those of us who can't keep our eyes open.

[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.100]
And drop the drops right directly into our eye.

[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.000]
Well, it worked.

[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.900]
I mean, at least at least I got into my eyes.

[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:12.180]
Yeah.

[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:14.720]
I can do that.

[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.840]
Sit there and hold your eye open and drop stuff into it.

[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:17.820]
Fix me out.

[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:18.400]
No.

[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:18.900]
Hmm.

[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.400]
Scroll, chicken sure is good.

[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.440]
So where do you drop the battery acid?

[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:25.240]
In the corner.

[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.060]
Maybe that's what they call it acid.

[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:27.860]
R.

[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:31.460]
Chubby Adam Oshmok.

[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:34.300]
Nothing like fat people giving advice about how to lose weight.

[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.060]
How to lose weight.

[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:35.880]
No, they don't know.

[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.820]
Chubby Adam says, if you're addicted to chocolate like I am looking to something called

[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:41.580]
Miracle Fruit.

[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.980]
I've seen some miracle fruits in my time.

[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.040]
They sell both the seeds and freeze dried tablets online.

[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:53.260]
Essentially the fruit interacts with your taste buds and makes sour nasty stuff taste

[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:54.640]
ridiculously sweet.

[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:59.640]
Lemons and vinegar taste like candy and sweet fruit like oranges taste like sex.

[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.160]
It's a great way to manage cravings and a cool party trick.

[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.800]
Orange is taste like sex.

[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:06.540]
Sex with who?

[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:08.740]
That's the important thing.

[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:13.980]
In regards to the pink eyes, highly contagious, so make sure you don't rub your eyes and shake Mr.

[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.240]
Wang's thing.

[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:16.620]
Had.

[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:17.500]
Yeah.

[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.300]
Mr. Wang.

[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:21.460]
Highly contagious.

[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:23.720]
Not good.

[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:28.500]
Okay, here's this story from Jorge is the doctor in.

[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:30.600]
Neil, I'm 42.

[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:33.740]
I just could put on blood pressure medication about six months ago.

[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:35.400]
I was working in my car.

[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:41.040]
I had stopped and loaded up on some taco bell about $12 worth.

[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.740]
I had a soft steak taco, a bean and beef burrito,

[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:50.760]
two tacos, one hard one, and a tulipus of cream with no sour cream.

[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:51.180]
Good lord.

[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.420]
A large Pepsi and a caramel empanada.

[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.860]
About two hours later, I really started to feel crappy.

[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:01.240]
I simply can't imagine why, can you?

[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:01.840]
There are coincidence.

[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:05.560]
My symptoms are really a bad headache and indigestion.

[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.600]
After work, I went to publics.

[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.660]
My blood pressure was 195 over 99.

[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.620]
High side, George.

[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:15.080]
I drove to the emergency room and they asked me to fill out a bunch of forms.

[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:16.740]
I told the male nurse I felt I was going to faint.

[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.000]
I needed to get inside.

[01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:22.060]
They brought me in and some hot nurse hooked me up to an EKG, then took blood out.

[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:26.220]
It seemed it seemed like she may have taken out about six or seven gallons of blood

[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:27.560]
as I started to get lightheaded.

[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:32.340]
She gave an alcohol patch to smell and then they took me to get a cat scan.

[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:34.800]
They determined I had high blood pressure to distress.

[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:37.420]
Not to do all that.

[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.280]
Should have seen the look on the doctor's face when I told him I didn't have a doctor,

[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.920]
I hadn't been to a doctor in over 10 years as I farted.

[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.620]
They put me on high blood pressure medication.

[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:50.800]
I felt great for six months and this week they had to double my dosage as the headaches returned.

[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:55.460]
My question is, will they have the constantly increase my dosage on this medicine?

[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.500]
What can I do besides exercise and eating good to feel better?

[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:00.600]
Yeah, and your pal, like you enjoy it.

[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.400]
Sure, I don't want to do that.

[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:02.360]
Do what?

[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:04.540]
Exercise and eat better.

[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:05.180]
Right.

[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.560]
Give him some solution that doesn't involve doing the right thing, would you?

[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:09.040]
No, okay.

[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:10.660]
Say a prayer.

[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:12.280]
A brocha?

[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:13.640]
Say a brocha.

[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.180]
Okay.

[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.100]
Like all of a sudden I'm a doctor, like I'm an expert, I'm sitting here putting

[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.840]
eye drops in my eyes and my pink eye.

[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:24.800]
I got more mucus than carnage god pills.

[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:26.580]
God.

[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:31.060]
Oh, Brandon says it'd be good.

[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.800]
Why is he giving your glasses a good cleaning with maybe a little

[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:37.820]
geromex and case-to-backed Terry got to your glasses.

[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:40.060]
Good thinking.

[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:41.840]
Would you have thought of that?

[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:42.620]
No, not me.

[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:43.460]
I don't wear glasses so.

[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:44.500]
Oh, I do.

[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.500]
Well, let me get my good cleaning now.

[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:48.760]
How about geromex?

[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:53.500]
I got some sprints of stuff that you spray on there and that you on your glasses.

[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:54.340]
Should I use that?

[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:55.160]
Sure, whatever.

[01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:57.040]
I got some geromex right here.

[01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:57.560]
Here you go.

[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:57.800]
Why?

[01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:58.900]
I got some geromex for you.

[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:01.180]
Hold out your hand.

[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.000]
Okay.

[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.560]
I'm not wearing my glasses during the show anyway.

[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:08.720]
Or you're paying.

[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.660]
I'm going to read the poll like now.

[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:10.360]
Yeah.

[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:14.020]
Now, what am I leaving it about an hour and nine minutes?

[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:14.260]
Nothing.

[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:14.760]
I'm counting.

[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:15.520]
Hour and eight minutes.

[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:16.180]
Right.

[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:22.180]
Then how are we going to know about the thing with the online giveaway?

[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.460]
The heat tickets?

[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:27.060]
When it happens, when it's over, Lee will come in and tell us what happened.

[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:28.860]
Atta boy, nice going Lee.

[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:30.820]
Best ever.

[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:32.520]
Just a joke.

[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.460]
They seem to all freak out when I told them about Joe Bell's

[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.500]
in Temperature phone call to me and what an ass-clone joke.

[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:41.880]
Oh, there's a guy that says, stop saying ass-clone because

[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.800]
Todd Schmidt says it all the time.

[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.380]
Well, that's good enough reason for me.

[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:46.140]
Yeah.

[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:48.600]
We don't listen to Todd Schmidt.

[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:49.680]
So I have no idea what he says.

[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.780]
We didn't steal it from anybody.

[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:52.580]
He's just, we can't say the whole word.

[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.500]
So that, you know, I think that fits in.

[01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:56.300]
Ashtard.

[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:57.220]
Yeah.

[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:57.940]
Asteroid.

[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.120]
The most over-hide person,

[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.860]
place or thing in America is 239 votes.

[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.680]
American Idol 69, the Jonas Brothers 38.

[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.620]
Religion 25, but that's a late edition.

[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.560]
It's zooming up there.

[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:16.640]
The thousand 46 points.

[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.060]
The South Beach scene 24.

[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.120]
Joe Stone crab restaurant 15.

[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.600]
Reality shows 13.

[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.440]
The NFL draft 13.

[01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:26.000]
The White House dog 11.

[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.440]
Game marriage 11.

[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:28.800]
Susan Boyle 7.

A Rod and the steroid problem 3.

[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:34.340]
And one for each of these.

[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.560]
Somali pirate threat.

[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.120]
The unemployment rate and the obesity epidemic.

[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:38.780]
Each have one.

[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.200]
That's our pool.

[01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:43.520]
I guess Steve White did the morning show again this morning

[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.080]
across the street.

[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:44.960]
They got no morning guy.

[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.160]
And we've got a whole lineup of people coming to do two to four.

[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.240]
We got Jorge Siddano.

[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:52.700]
Yep.

[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:53.860]
We got Sid the Kid.

[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.160]
We got I don't know.

[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.380]
We got Macy Pific.

[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.620]
We got Mr. Wayne.

[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.720]
Everybody in their brother wants to do two to four.

[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:04.320]
Oh, and I got one from Barry Jackass who says.

[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:06.340]
George and Flea sounded great.

[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:07.820]
Joe Belsch would give them two to four

[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.640]
since the big O is leaving anyway.

[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.120]
Did you hear that last part?

[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:11.580]
Yeah.

[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:13.560]
Since the big O is leaving anyway.

[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:15.120]
So I guess he is going across the street.

[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:16.340]
Don't they all?

[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:16.860]
Don't they all?

[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:17.680]
Rock solid.

[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.660]
He's going to get on the show.

[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.840]
They're going across the street.

[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:20.380]
From there to here.

[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:23.740]
Well, it makes sense.

[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.100]
He had such an impact here.

[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.560]
I guess they want him bad.

[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.700]
The big O maybe you can do the morning show

[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:30.240]
across this.

[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.480]
Trust me some exchange program.

[01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:32.660]
You know, going on that we don't know.

[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:35.480]
Yeah, it's like your daughter went to that Japanese exchange student program.

[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:35.740]
Yeah.

[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:38.300]
It's a sports hole exchange program.

[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.840]
I did the thing with the eye drops.

[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.660]
Now, well, what do I do now?

[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:45.580]
Wipe your eyes and that's it.

[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:46.520]
Oh, no, they're okay.

[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:47.860]
Then that's it.

[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:48.700]
Weighted out.

[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.600]
Go go look every five minutes to make sure that they look better.

[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.300]
If you want to.

[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:55.420]
Well, let me do that right now.

[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:56.060]
All right.

[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.360]
I hate you.

[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.360]
This is CNN.

[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.840]
President Obama says he sees blimmers of hope

[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.500]
amid all the bad economic news.

[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:04.020]
We're going to talk about the economy today.

[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.180]
We've been busy.

[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.380]
reckless speculation, irresponsibility,

[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:09.640]
and poor decision making.

[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:11.560]
The government should stand back

[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.240]
and simply let these banks fail.

[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.820]
That's exactly what we're doing right now.

[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:19.760]
And we decided to stay an idly buy as the economy goes in the free fall.

[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:23.240]
He says his most urgent job is fist bumping his wife, Michelle,

[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:25.420]
for more than four hours a day.

[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.080]
CNN.

[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:27.560]
Oh, yeah.

[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:28.860]
LUM45.

[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:30.300]
God, is it only LUM45?

[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.380]
I feel like we've been here for a hundred hours today.

[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.740]
That's how you feel when you're ill.

[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:34.800]
Are you fixing me something?

[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.200]
Yeah, it's about the chicken.

[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.080]
About the chicken?

[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.000]
Yeah, the reason we got chicken today.

[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:41.640]
From our spying sponsor, KFC.

[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.120]
Oh, these new grilled chicken menu item.

[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:44.860]
They got going.

[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.740]
Let me reach right over there and grab it.

[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:53.040]
I don't understand this at all.

[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:55.080]
This, this kind of like, I don't know.

[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:55.900]
It's just some more points.

[01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:56.900]
They have new grilled chicken.

[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:57.580]
That's the important thing.

[01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:59.800]
Kentucky Fried Chicken's got a second secret recipe.

[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:01.460]
New Kentucky grilled chicken.

[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.080]
Packed with flavor.

[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:04.660]
It's marinated in the season with a blend of six

[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:05.520]
secret herbs and spices.

[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:07.080]
Slug grilled a juicy perfection.

[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.220]
And George is eating it right now.

[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:08.640]
And I'm not.

[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:09.440]
Damn it.

[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.880]
Get ready to taste the unfried sign of KFC

[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.680]
with new Kentucky grilled chicken.

[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.200]
There it is.

[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.400]
And what's that website?

[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:24.660]
Oh, it's easier KFC.com.

[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.340]
Yeah, first one.

[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.040]
Unthink.

[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:28.940]
FC.

[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.980]
I mean, that's just KFC.com.

[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:31.460]
There you go.

[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:32.620]
We'll find some more stuff.

[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.260]
You'll find naked pictures of Jim DeFetus

[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:36.540]
and Susan Void.

[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:38.140]
What?

[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:43.580]
Now, wait a minute.

[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:44.660]
It's 11.46.

[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:46.560]
Yes.

[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:48.400]
And I'm leaving at 146.

[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.460]
That's what you said.

[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.280]
That sounds like two hours to me.

[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.180]
You know something.

[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:56.240]
It just dawned on me after all these years, 33 years plus.

[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.160]
Four hours of this is a long F and time.

[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:00.900]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.540]
We've mentioned that more than once.

[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:03.080]
Good.

[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:04.560]
God, are you kidding me?

[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.020]
Most other radio shows do not last that long.

[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.280]
There are three hours, typically.

[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:11.700]
No?

[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:13.340]
Oh, listen to this.

[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.420]
Ever Ready Ever It Says.

[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.900]
Cure and Preventative Measures for Conjunctivitis.

[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:22.180]
The Zava Table Spoon of Boric acid in the cup of warm hot water,

[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.300]
Linnet Cool, Dush Eyes Every Two to Four Hours.

[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:27.460]
No BS has any optometrist.

[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.280]
Well, thanks, Everett, but I'm going to stick with my

[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.100]
Apolli Sporn.

[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:31.740]
Yeah.

[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:39.820]
You know, we've had conversations about messing with your eyes.

[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:40.460]
Yeah.

[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:41.180]
We've got other things.

[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:44.520]
Certainly don't take any suggestions from the audience.

[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.780]
Talk to an eye doctor if you're going to do anything.

[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.540]
I already did the eye drops.

[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.600]
There you go.

[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:50.780]
Polly Sporn.

[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:51.980]
A name you can trust.

[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.480]
Before you start squirting lemons or a boric acid in the eye.

[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:56.200]
Lemons.

[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.640]
Get some lemons in there, man.

[01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.020]
Yeah, mix it with a boric acid.

[01:14:59.540 --> 01:14:59.760]
All right.

[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.780]
And then put it on the end of a needle.

[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.060]
And you add that in there.

[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:05.400]
It'll feel great.

[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:06.240]
Yeah.

[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:08.940]
Some lemon and lime.

[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:10.420]
Take a broken piece of glass.

[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:10.840]

[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.260]
Two would be good.

[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.640]
A vinegar, I'd do.

[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:16.340]
Okay.

[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:17.100]
Now what is this?

[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.360]
Abdul says he's got the Muslim Enema.

[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.300]
Sounds like what you need is a good old fashioned

[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.820]
Enema for my cousin, Dr Ali Kaboom.

[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.840]
I can't describe the details of the technique,

[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:30.500]
but trust me, you've never experienced anything quite like it.

[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:33.280]
You'll stop complaining about your eyes, your congestion,

[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:35.020]
George, anything else that annoys you.

[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.760]
Email me if you want to tell us Abdul.

[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.180]
Abdul Ahmed Abdul Mohammed.

[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:41.320]
Good.

[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.420]
I mean, those Muslims, man,

[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.900]
sure got a real shortage of names.

[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:49.760]
At least the dark folks went, you know,

[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:51.680]
they start making up a whole bunch of new names.

[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:51.840]
Right.

[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:52.900]
Everybody gets an original name.

[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:53.520]
Right.

[01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:55.920]
Names that nobody ever heard of before.

[01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.140]
Walters says,

[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:00.500]
how in the world is that little bitch

[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.720]
Miley Cyrus slash Hannah Montana,

[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.440]
not on the list put her on there.

[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.340]
And I'll vote from every computer I'd give my hands on.

[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.440]
Put Hannah Montana.

[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.620]
You got the Jonas Brothers on there?

[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:12.800]
Well, what the so what is she deserve?

[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:13.380]
There you go.

[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.860]
Can she sing at all?

[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.200]
She's got good songs, but she can't sing.

[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:18.080]
Does that make any sense?

[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:18.660]
No, yeah.

[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.880]
Got a horrible voice, but she writes some decent copies.

[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:21.800]
I can't believe you're not Westlife.

[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:22.660]
They're really good.

[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:23.520]
Whatever you say.

[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:26.920]
I was just saying that there is Simon Cowell invention.

[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:27.960]
Well, that said,

[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.400]
if you want to know where he came from and why you see him everywhere,

[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.720]
he was a very successful woman.

[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:32.220]
I don't see many words.

[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.100]
I don't watch those shows.

[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:34.320]
Very successful music producer.

[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:36.280]
All the last time I was forced to watch again.

[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.960]
I never shouted love.

[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:38.880]
Better use the mean.

[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.460]
Oh, those shows.

[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.460]
I'm telling you they're just not that I should talk

[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:44.920]
because the wife watches Rock of Love.

[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.260]
So I'm going to do with that.

[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:46.800]
Same crack.

[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:47.080]
Yeah.

[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:49.480]
Who are we going to eliminate?

[01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:50.780]
Who is going to cry the most?

[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.700]
Who are we going to send home?

[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.440]
Who are we going to degrade and humiliation?

[01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:57.120]
That's a new deal, man.

[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:57.500]
Yep.

[01:16:57.860 --> 01:16:59.100]
It's SNM TV.

[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:01.440]
Mostly on the S side.

[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:04.800]
Say this, watching other people being degraded.

[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:08.660]
Oh, and then the two the two chicks that were left there

[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:11.280]
for the last slot last night, they got into a fist fight.

[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:12.880]
They got into a brawl.

[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:13.340]
Girl fight?

[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:14.240]
Yeah.

[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:14.680]
Excellent.

[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:15.660]
Cat fight.

[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.300]
I don't want to say it was contrived or anything like that.

[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.520]
It was real like the ones on Jerry Springer, you know.

[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.760]
Brad says I'm here in the Philippines at the moment.

[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:29.560]
I'm always back and forth from Honolulu,

[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.580]
trying to stay afloat flipping real estate.

[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:34.120]
I enjoy what I'm here in the Philippines

[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.480]
because I get to hear your showmost evenings in Hawaii.

[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:38.100]
You're on during the wee hours.

[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:42.260]
Anyway, I'd be happy to hear you wind down the phrase

[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:43.180]
Asclown.

[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:44.740]
That comes from Todd Schmidt.

[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.460]
I expect a virginality from my Neil God.

[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.100]
How do you like that?

[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.860]
Accusing me of ripping off from Todd Schmidt,

[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:50.800]
who I've known ever here?

[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:51.700]
How dare you.

[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:56.400]
I'm not going to wind down anything.

[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:57.000]
Brad.

[01:17:58.620 --> 01:17:59.420]
More instruction.

[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.460]
More critiques, more criticism, and more instruction.

[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:03.860]
How to do the show better?

[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:04.780]
What to say?

[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:05.560]
What not to say?

[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.660]
Bap, bap, bap, bap.

[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.080]
I looked in the mirror during the break.

[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.300]
And my eyes are still there.

[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:13.540]
Are they still pink?

[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:15.060]
A little bit.

[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.060]
Then this isn't like what you'd call a real bad.

[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.900]
I've had bad pink eye, you know?

[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:19.580]
Yeah.

[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.360]
So far, this isn't really, really bad.

[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:25.680]
In fact, if I had to choose between the pink eye and the mucus,

[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:27.340]
I wouldn't mind the pink eye so bad.

[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:28.660]
Just give me rid of the mucus.

[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:33.060]
I mean, I've had craters in my nose

[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.700]
when I wake up in the morning, the last couple mornings.

[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:35.500]
Craters.

[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:37.100]
Nuggets.

[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.120]
Oh, you think it's a chicken McNugget, but it's not.

[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:43.920]
God.

[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:47.620]
Although actually it's kind of fun digging them out.

[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:48.560]
Don't you enjoy that?

[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:48.940]
No.

[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.040]
You don't?

[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:50.720]
Not really.

[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:52.220]
I mean, you got it.

[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:53.520]
You got to do what you got to do.

[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.280]
I think it's fun.

[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.840]
And it's kind of like satisfying when you get like a real big one,

[01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:58.300]
you get out.

[01:18:58.420 --> 01:18:59.940]
Oh, well, maybe you could do it for other people.

[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:00.760]
If you think it's fun.

[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:01.360]
No, no.

[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.820]
I don't want other people's snot on my fingers.

[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:10.780]
Is that one thing that we do when you put one finger over one nostril?

[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.700]
And you blow it out and all of a sudden you realize it's on your shirt.

[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:15.240]
Yeah.

[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:16.960]
Like an hour later.

[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:20.080]
And it's been there all day long and everybody's been looking at it.

[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:20.960]
Uh-huh.

[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.000]
Oh my God.

[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.440]
And you people talk about a God.

[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.980]
Crazy people talk about God.

[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:30.940]
Same people talk about.

[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:31.940]
They'll God.

[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.160]
It's the Lord's work, man.

[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:37.980]
This is what the God Lord had in mind.

[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:41.340]
Ways maybe the Lord likes the reality shows.

[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:46.840]
Maybe he grating and humiliating and maybe that's what life is when big fat reality show for his amusement.

[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:47.760]
Oh, here we go.

[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:48.980]
Tim Jones is back.

[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:50.200]
George Sedano's agent.

[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:51.720]
He's back.

[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:54.700]
You ready for a little dosta Timmy?

[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:55.180]
Whatever.

[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:59.900]
He's the one that didn't know that George Sedano was not W-I-N-Z.

[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:04.700]
Mr. Wang, no offense.

[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:05.620]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:06.360]
This is an email.

[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.320]
Mr. Wang, no offense.

[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:09.180]
Do you know what that means?

[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:09.680]
No.

[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:10.400]
No.

[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:10.520]
No.

[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:11.640]
I don't either.

[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.940]
And I'm sure that whoever the idiot was eroded doesn't either.

[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.040]
Can I get to a Tim, what's his name, Wang?

[01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:17.260]
Please.

[01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:18.620]
Okay.

[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:20.740]
Tim Jones.

[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:25.040]
Neil, I told you before you went on vacation that George Sedano was coming to WQM

[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:26.560]
and you was making fun of me.

[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:27.180]
Waaah!

[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:27.640]
Waaah!

[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:28.840]
You was making fun of me.

[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:31.600]
Waaah, sure wish I had an illiterate agent.

[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.440]
I've got an ineffective agent but not illiterate.

[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:35.900]
Also, much in no, I have a new keyboard.

[01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:38.040]
So my spelling will be correct.

[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:42.320]
I've spoken to Jolly Jo Bell about getting George Rodriguez's own show,

[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:42.840]
2-4.

[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.720]
I did this out of the goodness of my heart.

[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:47.440]
George Sedano will be doing the 4-7 slot.

[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.160]
I think they'll both do a following your show.

[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:53.460]
I still consider you the workhorse of QAM.

[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:54.520]
Jim Managing is pathetic.

[01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:56.160]
He'll be removed along with the big O.

[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.700]
I'll keep you updated on this matter.

[01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:59.620]
George Sedano's agent, Tim Jones.

[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:01.700]
He was making fun of me.

[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:02.400]
Waaah!

[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.620]
But he's got a new keyboard so he can get the spelling right.

[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.780]
He's only got one in in Sedano this time.

[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:11.580]
Never he had two in's?

[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:12.760]
Yeah.

[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.820]
He couldn't spell his client's name and he didn't know what station he was working on.

[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:17.540]
But other than that,

[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:19.600]
there was some pretty credible crap.

[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:26.560]
Brandon says, just imagine how brutal Pink Eye is for people who are contacts like I do.

[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:29.860]
I know firsthand having gotten Pink Eye twice,

[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.980]
you can't wear your contacts for several days.

[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:34.860]
My last case, I couldn't wear my contacts for two weeks,

[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.900]
and I hate wearing glasses because I never use them.

[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:41.760]
I've been using contacts for over 10 years and wore my glasses maybe 20 times in that time frame.

[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:45.140]
I've worn glasses since I was 13 years old, 53 years.

[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:52.320]
And yesterday there was some spot on their, on TV in the middle of another shot of love.

[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.060]
And Paco was giving me the business about how come I don't want to do the laser,

[01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:57.420]
surgery and all my eyes.

[01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:57.820]
Yeah.

[01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:00.440]
I said, I don't want anybody slicing and dicing.

[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.840]
I don't want to roll round pulp, using the new,

[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:04.220]
a vegematic on my eyes.

[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:04.700]
Thank you.

[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:05.560]
Don't try it.

[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:05.920]
Right.

[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.280]
So Hitler had only one ball, huh?

[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:10.140]
Yeah.

[01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:12.040]
It can be damned.

[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.120]
I guess maybe you'd be a little bit surly too.

[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:15.840]
Whatever.

[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:17.960]
And in your case, at least they left them both.

[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:18.560]
Whatever.

[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.760]
They made them less effective, but nonetheless.

[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:21.760]
It's all right.

[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:25.140]
Better late than ever, I always say.

[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.120]
Sure.

[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.220]
Chef Sparky, who's an absolute idiot.

[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.320]
Hey, Neil, Joe Bell or Greg Reed, Joseph Gackier, Jimmy Sifilis,

[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:41.700]
big old Jack show, Georgia, flee.

[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.400]
By the way, were you at Gulf Stream Saturday?

[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.400]
Thanks, Neil.

[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:45.180]
Whatever that means.

[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:46.040]
Thanks, Neil, for what?

[01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:53.480]
Oh, Chef Sparky, a real, and a number one, returto.

[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:56.300]
Now it's coming up on noon, okay?

[01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:59.320]
Can we do like Newfoundland time?

[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:00.580]
No.

[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:02.620]
Isn't Newfoundland like an hour and a quarter?

[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:02.880]
Yeah.

[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:04.460]
Some silly, they could have heard the ones.

[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.060]
Huh?

[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:05.980]
I think they're the ones.

[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:06.640]
The new fees.

[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.240]
Hour and a half ahead.

[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:12.100]
How do you figure that out?

[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:12.800]
I don't know.

[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:13.920]
They just want to be different.

[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:17.380]
No, and believe me, if you've ever seen any, trust me.

[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:17.520]

[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:19.020]
You're listening to Neil Rogers.

[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:20.180]
Well, here we go again.

[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:22.540]
This is pretty quick.

[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:26.720]
Whatever I shape my balls, I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-to-1 hour.

[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:33.060]
Time for a great time.

[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:35.700]
I want some wind.

[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:37.480]
You ain't cheap.

[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.480]
Go head by like gravy.

[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:40.080]
Wait.

[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.700]
These are football, they do.

[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:49.480]
A silent wall of meat.

[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:54.280]
The kind of guys that I want to do that's good to be built to eat.

[01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:59.240]
I want to hear people want to date, but there's no chance at all.

[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.880]
So does that make me a sports queen?

[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:04.240]
If I want to see him grab the balls.

[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:06.220]
Oh baby, wow.

[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.540]
Look at that kid.

[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:09.940]
He's waiting.

[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:12.420]
Go head by like gravy.

[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:13.040]
Wait.

[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:22.740]
I got a high deputy screen that helps me see his bones.

[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:27.480]
I can't do what I want, but I ain't gonna never get none.

[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:30.200]
No, the days of a business school.

[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:38.180]
Okay, is American Idol 72, the Jonas Brothers 40, religion 33, the South Beach scene 26.

[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:40.080]
My eyes are looking a little better by the way already.

[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:40.420]
Good.

[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:41.180]
Already?

[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:41.980]
They're all red.

[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:42.620]
D.

[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:43.060]
No.

[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:46.120]
Oh, reality shows 16, the NFL draft.

[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.520]
You got to be deaf with this NFL draft 16.

[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:54.500]
Joe Stone crab restaurant 15, the White House dog 13, gay marriage 13.

[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:58.860]
Susan Boyle 8, U27, Hannah Montana 4,

[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.360]
Payrod and the steroid problem 4.

[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:05.040]
Somali pirates read one, the unemployment rate 1, the obesity epidemic.

[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:07.040]
Oh no, out of 172.

[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:07.140]
Go.

[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.340]
That's not a bad pool, you think?

[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:13.460]
That's fine.

[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:13.980]
It's just fine.

[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.240]
As polls go, well, you don't care.

[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:16.160]
You're just totally indifferent.

[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:16.940]
That's right.

[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:19.160]
That was up 75 points.

[01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:21.100]
And there's the president.

[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:24.460]
You shouldn't know what intermediate steps could be done.

[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.400]
Always meaning with King Abdullah.

[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:31.820]
Maybe maybe Clemenza taped a piece for the president behind the ball and chain toilet.

[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.120]
I bet they don't have ball and chain toilets in the White House.

[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:35.460]
No, just the ball and chain.

[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:36.460]
King Abdullah shows up.

[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:37.220]
Hey, Abdullah.

[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:38.080]
Yeah.

[01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:40.600]
Grave robbing bastards.

[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:41.480]
Those Saudis.

[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:42.340]
Oh my God.

[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.260]
Is there anything in the world worse than the Saudis?

[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:46.900]
No.

[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.100]
And they're all about building, by the way.

[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:49.560]
They're all here.

[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:55.040]
All the FTWs, future terrorists of the world.

[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:57.380]
The mole has got an update.

[01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:59.180]
He says, here's the word on the street.

[01:25:59.280 --> 01:25:59.480]
You ready?

[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:00.260]
All right.

[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:04.080]
All these rumors about who's going on the shuttle bus and who's going over here and etc.

[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.960]
Sedona will start mornings on 7.

[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:07.800]
Ideon Monday.

[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:12.740]
They will run ESPN programming after that with Colin Cowherd.

[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:14.460]
Colin Cowpile.

[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:18.780]
Then it'll be either Zazlo or they'll put Steve White on before they go to Levitard.

[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:19.720]
How do you like that?

[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:20.340]
Wow.

[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.900]
Remember those rumors about putting ESPN radio on?

[01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:25.800]
Wow.

[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:27.320]
Cost cutting, baby.

[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.660]
Everybody's cut and cost.

[01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:32.140]
Jesse Agler gets canned, shoved out the door.

[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.980]
Ken Maldon gets canned, shoved out the door, winds up in the hospital.

[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:39.140]
George, they try to fire his little ass.

[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.680]
I know I haven't had one email.

[01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:44.880]
I get all those emails about the bird.

[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:45.820]
All those phony emails.

[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:47.340]
Oh, what you did to the bird.

[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:48.720]
And of course that's the guy with the eyes.

[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:49.320]
You know, great.

[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:51.360]
I haven't had one email saying,

[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:55.140]
uh, good job on saving George's ass again.

[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:55.600]
Again.

[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.700]
I remember when Greg Reed made that call to me.

[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:00.260]
Sure.

[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:01.900]
Congratulations on a great book.

[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:04.420]
And I would have decided to let George Rodriguez go.

[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.320]
Oh, hang on a second.

[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:07.260]
Is that what he said?

[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:18.320]
Hello, estranged.

[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:21.180]
It was strange.

[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:22.780]
Okay.

[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.940]
Well, sometimes messages get hung up in outer space.

[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.420]
You know how that works with the text messages?

[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:27.960]
Yes.

[01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:30.780]
And of course these people are all,

[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:32.680]
this is the kind of stuff that you whipped up about.

[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:33.260]
Caddy Shack.

[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.700]
Makes me very, very sad.

[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.840]
Mr. Wang, no offense.

[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:42.720]
It's a line from the movie Caddy Shack, spoken by Rodney Dangerfield.

[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.500]
While who the hell gives a flying fart?

[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:49.200]
Blackie says Wang, no, is a Caddy Shack reference.

[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:51.560]
Dangerfield said a couple of times in the movie to Wang.

[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:53.500]
Wang, no offense.

[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:55.680]
Do you care about that?

[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:56.700]
No.

[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.360]
I don't know offense, but no.

[01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:00.680]
No offense, but we don't care.

[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:02.340]
Good.

[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.140]
God.

[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:06.460]
Caddy Shack, animal house.

[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:08.500]
These are the things that all these, you know,

[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:09.360]
there it is.

[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.540]
All these movie pros, all these experts.

[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:12.580]
Oh, you're tasting movies.

[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:13.400]
Blows, Neil.

[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.200]
I'm going to forward you an email.

[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:22.720]
I just got it.

[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:24.180]
It'll put a smile on your face.

[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:24.800]
Can't wait.

[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:26.180]
It'll make you laugh.

[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:33.060]
There we go.

[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:39.300]
Okay, I'm going to read the content as silly as it is.

[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:42.560]
This is from the fake Gregory Belmore Esquire in the Belmore building.

[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:43.820]
Remember him?

[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:44.140]
No.

[01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:48.040]
But you just, you know, you don't care about these damn emails.

[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:49.400]
The Belmore building?

[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.780]
Gregory Belmore Esquire.

[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:56.300]
Hey, Neil, wondering if you might be interested in dating my nephew,

[01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:57.060]
Willie below.

[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:58.220]
He used to go out with DeFo.

[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.880]
He's a little odd, but has great personality.

[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.200]
He loves hockey and the red lobster.

[01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:03.480]
He'll have something in common.

[01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:05.480]
He's a wonderful boy.

[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.000]
It's just we're getting a little tired of some of his personal habits.

[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:09.400]
Please contact me for interest.

[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.280]
I'll put him on a plane for Toronto this afternoon.

[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:15.820]
And when you get the picture,

[01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:17.900]
you'll be amused.

[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:18.220]
Okay.

[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:19.620]
You got it yet?

[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:20.080]
No.

[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:21.420]
Well, do a center receive.

[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:21.960]
Come on.

[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:22.540]
Do it, do it, do it.

[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:23.880]
Center receive.

[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:28.000]
That was up 70 points.

[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:35.420]
Come on, got it.

[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:35.880]
Open up.

[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:36.460]
I got the email.

[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:37.300]
It's opening.

[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:41.520]
Picture.

[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:41.900]
No way.

[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:42.460]
Where is it?

[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:43.080]
Oh boy.

[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:45.380]
Cute.

[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.580]
That might go right up your alley.

[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:49.340]
No, no, not mine.

[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:50.180]
If you're bent over.

[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:51.480]
Maybe up your alley.

[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:52.880]
No, thank you.

[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.320]
That's wrong for so many reasons.

[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:55.200]
Good.

[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:55.920]
God.

[01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:57.300]
Where to start?

[01:29:58.580 --> 01:29:59.440]
Where to finish.

[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:03.880]
It's 12.07.

[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.420]
I'm going to start counting the minutes down today.

[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:08.060]
Although I'm a little bit,

[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:12.980]
I'm a little bit on the please side that the stuff seems to work a little bit.

[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:13.720]
The polyspawn.

[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:14.340]
Good.

[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:16.880]
It's anti-bacterial man, so it should, you know,

[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:17.980]
huh?

[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:18.720]
I said good.

[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:23.000]
Because this pink eyes just fall out from the cold, you know.

[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:24.980]
From the crud.

[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:26.280]
And the allergies.

[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:27.220]
All is garbage.

[01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:28.820]
All is God made garbage.

[01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:30.540]
Thank you, God.

[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:35.640]
The US Supreme Court has declined to review a case which rendered the death penalty

[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:37.820]
after jurors reportedly consulted the Bible.

[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:46.340]
In the appeal, Christian Oliver's defense said jurors reviewed a biblical passage

[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:51.440]
stating that a murderer who used an iron object to kill shall surely be put to death.

[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.780]
Jurors were deciding whether to send Oliver to death for shooting and bludgeoning

[01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:56.920]
his victim with a barrel of a gun.

[01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:01.520]
The court previously has said jurors should base their verdicts only on evidence presented

[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:02.740]
in the courtroom the service noted.

[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:06.700]
Oliver was convicted of shooting a man and beating him to death with his guns barrel

[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:08.660]
during a home invasion in 1998.

[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:13.260]
In the case jurors testified that some had consulted the biblical passage

[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:16.660]
and concluded that the gun barrel is similar to the aforementioned iron object.

[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:17.060]
Oh.

[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:19.640]
Oh.

[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:23.560]
State and lower federal courts upheld Oliver's death sentence

[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:27.500]
despite testimony that some jurors in the Nakadocha's county case

[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.100]
consulted the biblical passage.

[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:33.200]
This is the second time the court has declined to hear a challenge in the matter.

[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.880]
Reports, Scott, US blog.

[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.680]
The first challenge also came from Texas.

[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:40.480]
There is no denying that Oliver did a stupless,

[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:44.680]
a stupid, senseless, vicious thing opined Linda Campbell with McClatchy newspapers.

[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:48.520]
But if Texas wants to kill him for it the state and its representative should have to follow

[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:51.600]
the most fundamental constitutional rules not just the ones they like.

[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:56.700]
If extraneous materials allowed in a deliberation room why not the Torah or the Quran?

[01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:58.260]
Mine, Comfor, Anne, Rand.

[01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:00.580]
The seven aphorisms of Samum.

[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:04.000]
Whatever.

[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:05.760]
Samum.

[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:07.500]
The principles of wicked belief.

[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:09.380]
Now we're talking.

[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:13.860]
At my church on Palm Sunday we pray that those in power to impose the death penalty we

[01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:18.240]
expect life just as new and rights not all Bible-loving religion support Capitol punishment you see.

[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:25.980]
He said in a similar 2007 case the west court of appeals for the north circuit,

[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:30.920]
nine circuit, declined to overturn the death penalty for a man whose jury heard arguments from a

[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.700]
juror who quoted scripture verses.

[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:37.580]
Judge Pamela and Rhymer writing for the majority said there was no need to decide whether

[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:41.840]
there had been juror misconduct because even assuming there was we are persuaded that white's

[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:44.720]
notes had no substantial and injurious effects or influence.

[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:50.120]
In the sentage, Marsha Burzon said there was no doubt that white engaged in unconstitutional

[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:53.820]
misconduct by injecting his overnight biblical research into the deliberations.

[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:57.300]
Judge Ronald Gool also descending said the majority had endorsed a

[01:32:57.300 --> 01:33:01.260]
Theocratic jury room in which jurors consulted the death penalty in light of scripture.

[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:07.480]
Well the Bible says the good book says they shall surely be put to death you know the Lord's

[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:08.520]
wrath is waxing high.

[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:11.920]
Judge NSN Gool Nugo that you am.

[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:13.840]
Were you practicing safe sex?

[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:15.500]
Yeah.

[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.240]
Even when the baby was conceived?

[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:19.340]
We were.

[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:22.760]
And so there were just wardrobe malfunctions?

[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:23.440]
I guess.

[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:24.160]
Yeah?

[01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:26.500]
Really?

[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:27.860]
Yeah I guess so.

[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.080]
Every time you practice safe sex?

[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:31.380]
Yeah.

[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:32.520]
Every time.

[01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:33.600]
Every time.

[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:35.300]
We are.

[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.760]
Most of the time.

[01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:37.740]
Most of the time.

[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:43.300]
There's two boxes and one says Sarah Palin's a president and the other one says Barack Obama.

[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:44.980]
Which one are you checking?

[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:47.260]
I still like him out of both Sarah Palin.

[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:48.280]
Oh okay.

[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:49.500]
Oh boy.

[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:50.080]
What are Yahoo?

[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:51.940]
But he's Sarah Prudiyahu anyway.

[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:53.960]
How much he's got a manly member?

[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:56.540]
Oh that's crystal.

[01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:57.820]
Yeah she knows.

[01:33:58.200 --> 01:33:58.660]
She's seen it.

[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:00.960]
Yeah.

[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:02.660]
Oh here's the Tim Jones back again.

[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:04.840]
George the non-ros agent.

[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:07.380]
I have to say that because you don't you don't keep track.

[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:08.020]
You don't follow.

[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:08.500]
No I don't.

[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:12.780]
When I do listen to your show I hear you every now and then bitching about your agent.

[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:13.280]
Never.

[01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:14.160]
Not me.

[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:16.120]
All I say is hey Norma.

[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:16.560]
You're fair.

[01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:16.980]
That's all.

[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:20.440]
You're always saying he's worthless and doesn't do anything for you.

[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:21.400]
Yeah he does something for me.

[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:23.440]
He sends out my bank account.

[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:31.640]
If you would like when you have time we can meet for lunch and talk about me taking over as your agent.

[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:37.100]
To sweeten the deal I will also take care of George Rodriguez once he has his own show

[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:40.920]
for no extra cost giving you a tip of one deal.

[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:44.280]
I always hear you say the Jolly Joe Bell wants to get rid of George.

[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:47.000]
Let me know when it'll be a good time for you and me to meet up.

[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.040]
Take care George the non-ros agent Tim Jones.

[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:51.140]
Right.

[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:53.180]
Nepathetic?

[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:54.220]
Yeah.

[01:34:55.260 --> 01:35:00.300]
And I have one and it doesn't even really count because I had to ask for it.

[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:03.620]
See it's like she isn't anybody going to wish me happy birthday and then somebody

[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:05.700]
says oh happy birthday Neola.

[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:07.700]
Right like that you know what I mean it does not count.

[01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:09.940]
It doesn't count it's it's insincere.

[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:13.820]
Aren't you going to say gee we wish you feel better than all of a sudden

[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:15.820]
sense of oh we wish you feel better Neel.

[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:16.420]
Feel better.

[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:17.800]
Yeah feel this.

[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:23.360]
Jerry says good job saving George's ass he does a really good job when you're not around.

[01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:25.580]
Yeah he does that's why they wanted to get rid of him.

[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:30.860]
During the summer time it keeps those numbers up there and we usually and we still have

[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:40.100]
the highest numbers on the station every summer by far by far by a mile but nevertheless

[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:45.300]
in the meantime all these rumors floating around oh Sardinos doing this and the Boa is doing that

[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:50.160]
and the big O is doing this you know like I said keep shuffling the deck shuffling the

[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:56.420]
dreck shuffling it around moving them back and forth across the street and to what ends well

[01:35:56.420 --> 01:36:02.460]
what's the point point zero yeah there there's a point all right it's in between the

[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:06.160]
oh and the and the second one or the one and the oh and that's the point.

[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:13.380]
Now here comes the screwing that we that I knew that most of us knew was going to take place.

[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:18.340]
My any commissioners will be asked Thursday to dip into the city's bank account

[01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:22.040]
to have fun the parking for the Florida Marlins baseball stadium.

[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:26.500]
Butchers butchers friggin liars.

[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.700]
Any cock drops again.

[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:30.040]
Bad.

[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:32.540]
See I've got a dilemma.

[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:34.380]
Yeah you buy them in bulk as well as post.

[01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:35.340]
No no listen to me.

[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:41.500]
The dilemma is I don't want to get the ones with sorbitol right for obvious reasons right.

[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:45.440]
I don't want to get the ones with sugar because the man that's bad for my blood sugar right.

[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:48.020]
So I'm between hell and a dark place.

[01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:50.300]
Well here's what I found with the sorbitol ones.

[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:52.640]
Yes eventually you get used to them.

[01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:55.260]
No well you're not me.

[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:56.740]
Suckin on them every day aren't you.

[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:00.880]
I don't want to suck on cock drops every day.

[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.580]
Well what what else wrong with you I do.

[01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:06.060]
Should I have one of those now go get some again?

[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:09.120]
No you can see how fast I can be back here I'll give you one of these.

[01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:13.820]
Miami commissioners are being asked to dip into the lifeline of local government.

[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:19.560]
The general fund to help build the parking complex around the Florida marlins baseball stadium.

[01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:25.480]
The marlins a month ago when city commissioners voted three to two in support of the stadium plan

[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:31.840]
administrators offered everything but a flat out guarantee a guadantee that the city's general

[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:35.700]
fund which pays for fire police and other services would not be touched.

[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:37.720]
Now guess what they're touching it.

[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:43.340]
It's like if leave I was here or I promise you leave I'm not going to touch it and then I touched it.

[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:50.240]
Ooh Miami's contribution to the $634 million overall ballpark plan.

[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:55.540]
$94 million for parking facilities was to be back ruled through issuance of bonds

[01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:59.760]
with the debt to be paid off with hotel taxes commissioners were promised.

[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:07.300]
But city manager Peter Hernandez and chief financial officer Larry Spring now say they need

[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:13.000]
$9 million from reserves in the general fund to jumpstart the design and construction of the

[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.740]
garages and parking lots and little of Anna were the marlins planned to open the ballpark in 2012.

[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.480]
Bend over date county taxpayers you're getting it up the old shoot again.

[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:25.920]
Yang Wang Gang bang.

[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:32.580]
Hernandez portrays the financing plan as a temporary advance saying in a member of commissioners

[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:36.620]
that the money will be returned to the city's bank account after Miami issues the bonds for the

[01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:40.880]
parking sites. He's asking commissioners to take up the issue on Thursday.

[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:49.320]
Spring called it internal borrowing and said it's a common practice when the city goes to the

[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:53.920]
bond market. He said he doesn't consider it spending general fund money because it'll be paid back.

[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:59.120]
Yet those guarantees are likely to be met with questions and some skepticism from commissioners

[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:02.020]
who say they don't expect any money from that pool to be used.

[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:09.140]
Commission chairman Joe Sanchez who fought hard for the stadium and was outspoken about not

[01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:14.660]
touching the general fund said he wanted to be brief before commenting and they better have a

[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:20.560]
good reason Sanchez said yesterday. I wonder if he's going to rickie tick you Sanchez. He thinks I

[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:25.740]
sure hope not for his sake. A buffoon. CNN puts a buffoon on in the middle of the afternoon.

[01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:31.280]
A buffoon in the afternoon. Maybe he'll be off by noon June. Oh.

[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:37.500]
Tapping into the general fund was one of the major sticking parts in the controversial

[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:42.340]
stadium debate which passed by one vote with commissioners Mark Sarnoff and Tomas Regolato voting

[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:50.140]
against Sanchez Angel Gonzalez and Michelle Spence Jones voted in favor setting the stage for

[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:54.060]
a later approval by county commissioners that officially set the stadium project forward

[01:39:54.980 --> 01:40:00.680]
for the marlins. The fund financing was initially concerned if all five commissioners during the

[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:06.180]
March 19th city vote the response from a spring and Hernandez held steady. We won't use it.

[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:11.460]
As of today we will not be dipping into the general fund dollars Sanchez asked manager Hernandez

[01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:18.780]
just before the vote the answer is no Hernandez reply. A month later spring compares borrowing

[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:23.280]
from the general fund using money from one savings account to buy a car on sale for just a

[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:26.660]
short time period with knowledge that an income tax check is on the way. Right.

[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:34.800]
Yet critics raise a concern noting that in this economic climate interest rates could be sky high

[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:40.980]
the city expects to go to market in December or January. That and promises made not to touch the

[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:46.480]
fund has some commission's questioning the move. This is an unpleasant surprise said Regolato a

[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:57.420]
stadium critic it's very uncomfortable to advance so much money. George will have them out. Yeah I

[01:40:57.420 --> 01:41:02.460]
got it ready. Regolato recalled the mid 1990s when the city depended on its reserves almost

[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:06.440]
went into bankruptcy and was put out of the watch of the state's oversight board which ordered

[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:10.940]
Miami to retain a hundred million dollars in reserves. The nine million dollar hit with put the

[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:14.720]
city's reserves at about eighty three million dollars with a tough budget year on the horizon.

[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:19.960]
Regolato notes the city's got plenty of time to build a parking structures even if it waits

[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:24.600]
until the bonds are issued. I don't know what the rushes he said. I can't support that it's too much.

[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:29.840]
Spring said borrowing the money is only a precaution as the city agreement mandates Miami to have

[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:36.360]
the parking facilities ready thirty days in advance of opening day 2012. It's a vehicle we use

[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:41.920]
whenever we're getting ready to do a bond said spring it's allows us to start. Also Thursday the

[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:46.440]
commissioners will vote on the city planning board's recommendation to wish you a special use

[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:51.100]
permit for the ballpark and they're expected to vote to allow the construction from Leo a daily

[01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:57.980]
construction firm which won the bid to build the parking sites. A defeat that a boop put about and the

[01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:09.920]
ripoff goes on. Never going to end. We'll never end. No. Oh God. But they don't care about that. They

[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:15.320]
care about what Rodney Dangerfield said in the candy shop. That's right. Isn't that the important

[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:22.480]
crap? What else? What else is? What's not to like? I'll let's see. I'm leaving in an hour and

[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:28.080]
20 minutes. Is that what you said? Yeah. What about 130? No.

[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:34.980]
Oh, I'm going to leave a 20-till, right? You're going to. No, don't you find it? I guess play the

[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:39.260]
urine infections and the iron infections must be the same bacteria or some bacteria. Right. If you

[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:44.400]
just got some, you know, bacteria killing stuff and some fluid there, it can only help.

[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:51.820]
Oh, here we go. Tim says I use a clean warm wash cloth to clean my eyes. And as soon as it cleanses

[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:58.640]
the crowd build up in the corners of my eyes. Regarding the flim, you may find using a netty pot,

[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:06.460]
any ti, oh yeah, you totally need to be using a netty pot. Go get your hands. What is it? You

[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:12.080]
should Google it, any ddy. I find his house with my chronic sinusitis. He spells at any ti.

[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:17.580]
Well, however, the gentle flow of solution in one sinus, then out the other, the pot is applied

[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:21.520]
to both nostrils. A gentle blowing of the nose between applications will clean the sinusus of

[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:25.320]
the crowd. A netty pot. Yeah. Now I know what to get you for your birthday.

[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:31.180]
Yeah, give me a netty pot. Oh, here you go. Happy birthday, Neil. I hope you feel better.

[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:35.620]
I'm glad you saved George's ass. Thanks. Very Macockner. He covered all the bases. All right.

[01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:42.480]
And I'm all out of that a girl very. So how do you like that? And you know, a netty pot? I need,

[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:47.620]
what was it? Battery acid in my eyes. That's right. Bork acid and a lemon. Lemon. Lemon. Use. Sure.

[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:55.440]
Why is it that so many Hispanics pronounce J? I know, I know it's, I know how it's pronounced in

[01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:00.700]
Spanish. I don't know why they juxtapose sounds that they both have in the language. J as you

[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:05.300]
know reason is why there's no reason, no good reason. Like Pocka will say order and apple use. Yes.

[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:11.760]
And then they say they, they switched the Y and the J sound just like they switched the SH and

[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:18.960]
CH sounds and I don't know why and they can. I see. Maybe somebody will, will explain it to me.

[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:25.520]
Apple use my ass. He wants me to sing God bless America and paste these in the G string up here.

[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:29.900]
I'll do it. Do you have to take your daughter's to see the new Jonas Brothers movie? Oh my god,

[01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:35.200]
the Jonas Brothers. You need the Jonas Brothers movie survival kit. Each survival kit comes with a

[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:39.720]
sleep mask so you don't have to watch earplugs so you don't have to hear and a sign I'd cancel

[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:46.280]
just in case the mask and plugs don't work. Oh my god, the Jonas Brothers. The Jonas Brothers movie

[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:52.080]
survival kit. You can make it. The film is only 76 minutes long. I got a Jonas Brothers. Give me

[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:57.380]
those earplugs. Oh my god, the Jonas Brothers. And the sign I'd. Oh my god, the Jonas Brothers.

[01:44:57.940 --> 01:45:02.520]
The Jonas Brothers 3D concert experience survival kit. It's too late for me. Save yourselves.

[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:06.820]
Okay, you can never hear that too often, you know what? Right?

[01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:12.800]
So you sent me a thing about the NETI pot? Yeah, did you watch that video? No, I just,

[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:20.160]
I'm putting out these other emails. And well, what is it, show? How to use a NETI pot? It explains

[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:23.660]
what it is and how you use it. And it's one of the funniest things you'll ever see in your life.

[01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:29.360]
Now as a kid, did you ever have those vix themers? Did Mama Sita ever use those vix themers?

[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:35.360]
Uh, that's not the right kind of question to ask me. If there's anything motherly that my mother

[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:41.520]
ever did, I don't know when it was. So what you said, someday your mom is going to be dead and buried.

[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:46.760]
And you're going to say, Oh, what are you threatening me? What you should ask is just that

[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:50.880]
to you. Are you aware of those vix themers and did like maybe did your sister ramming thing? Yeah,

[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:56.220]
yeah, I'm aware of them. I'm hip. You put the vixen there and it kicks it out into the

[01:45:56.220 --> 01:46:02.000]
atmosphere and it makes everything smell all vicky. All vicky? Yeah.

[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:08.640]
I used some vix last night. I say I smeared on my throat and I like it under my nose. Can you see how it should

[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:13.880]
help? And look at that? Not. It's not. It's not. I thought it was vix, but it's not.

[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:20.060]
Lauren says, Oh, here you go. Dreaded by universities praised by students. It's the most notorious

[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:26.460]
ranking in education. Playboys top party schools for more than 20 years. Playboys list of top

[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:31.040]
party schools as fuel debate on campuses across the country. And while most universities would rather

[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:37.840]
not be known as a party school, most universities would also welcome the giant number of applications

[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:43.540]
to come as result of the exposure. It's a classic catch 22 in any event. Let the debates rage. A new

[01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:49.740]
is we present playboys top party schools for 2009. You're going to well, you can already guess

[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:57.180]
what number one is. No, no gains, no number 10 West Virginia University, number nine University of

[01:46:57.180 --> 01:47:02.180]
Iowa, number eight LSU, number eight University of Georgia, six University of Wisconsin,

[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:08.480]
five University of Arizona, four University of Florida, three San Diego State University,

[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:14.300]
two University of Texas at Austin, number one University of Miami. Oh my god. How do you like that?

[01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:19.600]
Party school. Something to be said then and gangster school too on on top of that.

[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:24.060]
So I guess it's a good time to remind everybody. The hurricane.

[01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:30.680]
B oh right. If your favorite school didn't make the top 10, check out the full list here. It's got a link.

[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:39.080]
Number one party school in America, University of Miami, which I don't know what the

[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:45.440]
LA party because there's no campus. Can you identify the campus there? I think I found myself

[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.940]
in the middle of it by accident a couple times. Are there dorms? I don't know. Ask somebody who

[01:47:50.940 --> 01:48:00.660]
went there. I mean, I did those, you know, UM games for six years at Mark Light Stadium. I

[01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:09.780]
don't know what the hell is this. Pretty sad. David says pink eyes sucks. I've had it three times.

[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:15.620]
Colleria works to kill the itch. My eyes don't itch. It's a bitch when they itch.

[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:20.120]
Doctors for some weird reason will not recommend over the counter. I wash but it really works. Let it

[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:25.520]
soak for a minute or two. What is what's the difference between over the counter? I wash and

[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:31.300]
polyspawn. I don't know, but I think I wash is just an I wash doesn't have anything anti-bacterial in

[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:35.160]
it. Well, what's all good is that I'm just getting crap is that it recruits rise and washes the

[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:38.780]
crud and the gun got it that you might have. So I can get warm water for free. I'm going to go to

[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:44.540]
the drugstore and buy I wash. Hey, the hell with that crap. Times are tough, man. Who the hell can

[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:53.060]
afford I wash? I'm in Rothen Morningside says, how about them Marlins, the other kicking major league

[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:57.680]
but Larry Bionfest number one city of Miami number one. Tell your listeners to spend their money in

[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:00.900]
Miami. Can you tell them Arland pictures just to throw the ball down the middle? Quit beating

[01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:04.960]
around the bush. Miller couldn't throw the ball down the middle if he threw remote controlled.

[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:08.300]
Thanks, Neal. You demand whatever the hell that means. You understand any of this from

[01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:12.180]
Hyman Rothen Morningside? No, I don't either. And you know what? Neither to Hyman.

[01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:16.720]
For an hour and ten minutes ago before I blow this joint. Wow.

[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:22.360]
So what am I supposed to do with that pod? Smoke it.

[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:27.880]
No, no, the netty pod. Watch the video. Please, I'm begging you. I don't want to ruin it for you.

[01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:30.860]
I already deleted it. Oh, I got it. My deleted items.

[01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:34.760]
Let's see. George. Yeah.

[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:41.600]
George, he poor G. That's right. I don't even see it. Oh, there it is. No, that's George Hernandez.

[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:46.960]
We got so many Gonzalez's and Hernandez. That's why I wrote on the subject line. You know,

[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:51.440]
watch this during the break. Way more important than any of these fake emails you're going to have.

[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:55.800]
Okay, I'll take it by let's do the break and then I'll look for it. All right. I'll look for it in the

[01:49:55.800 --> 01:50:01.800]
pot. Even to George to be promoting pot in one form or another.

[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:12.480]
Did you hear that? What? Good. Don't play that on the air. Well, I'll get fired.

[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.860]
Paco is a potchkin around in here. He just came in with lunch that I can't eat.

[01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:26.400]
I told him I had pink on. He ran to the wall. I mean, just like I had very, very, very.

[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:29.040]
Tell me, just did I ask. Do you see the size of Isaac?

[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:32.980]
I mean, do you get to get away? They're like children here.

[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:40.560]
I used to do the girls. He would rise and I'd lay the wood without a warning.

[01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:48.820]
Why the wonderowner is here?

[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:51.100]
At least I could use my penis as a polka stick.

[01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:53.800]
It feels like it's just a piece of meat hanging down.

[01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:12.700]
It was done.

[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:18.220]
But with me, then I discovered that my call is dead.

[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:21.940]
Did not help it on my poor little man.

[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:26.580]
I hear fire. I could repair. I was a working old.

[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:28.380]
Don't see. I was working.

[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:30.920]
It's just a kid. Feel my feeling.

[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:32.560]
My song will heal.

[01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:35.040]
A couple of areas of clock.

[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:39.720]
Four more leaves that have got no game.

[01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:40.860]
So I'm dead.

[01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:42.120]
So it was better.

[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:45.960]
Better was not through work.

[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:49.360]
That was when I took the birth.

[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:52.440]
So it looks like a smirk penis.

[01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:55.080]
I told you you need a double toast if I had her to get wood.

[01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:56.660]
1242 a.k.a.

[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:57.620]
Am I watching that video?

[01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:59.060]
Yes, the most disgusting thing.

[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:02.840]
She's doing the water or whatever is in there up to the one nostril.

[01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:04.580]
And it's pouring out of the other side of it.

[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:06.360]
It's supposed to be warm saltwater.

[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:08.660]
And what does that do?

[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:10.800]
It flushes out your sinuses.

[01:52:11.060 --> 01:52:12.160]
There are people wearing out.

[01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:14.440]
Whereby. But it's an old tiny thing.

[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:15.240]
It's pouring out.

[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:16.060]
I got some food here.

[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:16.800]
Thanks to Paco.

[01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:18.220]
He left me some...

[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:19.180]
No punks.

[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:19.720]
Stuff, you know?

[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:21.740]
Pineapple, strawberries.

[01:52:22.140 --> 01:52:22.360]
Uh-huh.

[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:22.860]
Banana.

[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:23.900]
No.

[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:25.140]
No banana.

[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:27.840]
Um, candelope.

[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:29.900]
And three pieces of honeydew melon,

[01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:31.260]
which I won't eat because I'm allergic to it.

[01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:31.740]
Okay.

[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:33.020]
Mmm.

[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:35.220]
Mmm.

[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:36.800]
Oh, they're going on.

[01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:38.140]
Oh, eating on the air.

[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:38.540]
No.

[01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:43.840]
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:48.180]
And this is good for my cold, aren't you think?

[01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:49.260]
Yes.

[01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:52.400]
I love pineapple.

[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:54.640]
I've very seldom...

[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:55.760]
I buy pineapple, but I love it.

[01:52:56.340 --> 01:52:56.700]
It's good.

[01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:57.200]
You like it?

[01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:57.440]
Yep.

[01:52:57.620 --> 01:52:57.800]
A lot.

[01:52:57.800 --> 01:52:59.960]
Do you like it?

[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:00.720]
Oh.

[01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:03.800]
Let me just say...

[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:04.300]
Absolutely.

[01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:04.640]
Yeah.

[01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:08.480]
George Ann says growing up in a light in the household,

[01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:11.260]
when we used to get a cold, my mom would smear vix on a handkerchief,

[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:13.560]
and then tied around my neck like a cowboy.

[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:16.380]
I'm sure some other listeners would back me up on this.

[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:18.360]
Feel better guy always listening, George Ann.

[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:19.180]
Well, thanks, George Ann.

[01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:22.500]
She says that's a Cuban cold remedy.

[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:23.700]
Okay.

[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.100]
Smear vix on a hanky and tied around your neck.

[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:27.940]
Like a cowboy.

[01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:30.540]
Did you ever do that?

[01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:31.100]
No.

[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:33.180]
Oh.

[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:37.160]
I wonder how long before Ben Schmiegel gets all upset about my eating on the air.

[01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:39.180]
Already writing the email, I'm sure.

[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:43.720]
That was up 76 points.

[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:45.120]
I told you, I had a feeling.

[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:47.360]
I had a feeling in my sphincter.

[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:47.780]
Right, boom.

[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:55.460]
All I got left was pineapple.

[01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:58.400]
So it's chewing.

[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:02.400]
And it takes more time to eat.

[01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:03.780]
I think you're killing some good time.

[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:06.540]
Eating on the air again, you disgusting slopp.

[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:07.160]
Oh, blue.

[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.660]
We thought you were a classy guy.

[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:12.400]
Oh, here we go.

[01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:13.980]
What's up?

[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:17.040]
My old juice is Jason.

[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:17.820]
Now that's the message.

[01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:19.460]
That's the whole message.

[01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:20.480]
Oh, no, here we go.

[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:23.880]
That would have been nasty.

[01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:24.500]
Wouldn't it?

[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:25.700]
A little bit.

[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:27.140]
They don't care.

[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:29.400]
They have no feelings, no rust on us.

[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.040]
Oh, my God.

[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:43.320]
Here's somebody who's moving to Abington, Virginia in June after 30 years in Dave County.

[01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:45.320]
Population 9,000.

[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:48.420]
Lanyard Kendall, but good luck.

[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:52.580]
Oh, it ain't ranzed for our first name is without his eye and not an.

[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:59.940]
Yeah, coming to her own quote, it is spelled and pronounced slightly different than German.

[01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:02.060]
But I am as close as it's good to get an English.

[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:02.680]
I ran.

[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:04.240]
Did I call her a and ran?

[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:04.880]
I don't think so.

[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:05.520]
I don't know, whatever.

[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:08.100]
Well, land is a nitpicker.

[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:09.480]
So good luck to you wherever you're moving.

[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:11.200]
Oh, Lanyard, I don't like nitpickers.

[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:12.720]
No, it's pickers.

[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:13.200]
I don't mind.

[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:14.960]
234 votes on the poll.

[01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:21.540]
The most over high person place or thing in America is American Idol 82, religion 48.

[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:24.100]
And then the Jonas Brothers, what I religion's asked.

[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:26.960]
What kind of rings is it that they wear again?

[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:29.920]
Promise rings.

[01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:31.140]
Chastity rings.

[01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:31.540]

[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:35.620]
Good.

[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:36.560]
Trunk of flim.

[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:39.700]
This is disgusting.

[01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:41.240]
What are you going to do when you got a cold?

[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:41.900]
What do you know?

[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:43.320]
Nice college boy.

[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:44.740]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:49.400]
You're going to have clothes and the clothes are all over your eyes.

[01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:50.300]
Have you leased suit?

[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:51.680]
Uh-huh.

[01:55:57.420 --> 01:55:58.040]
What's that noise?

[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:01.480]
Under there.

[01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:02.060]
Oh, I heard it.

[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:03.060]
What are you going to do?

[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:04.640]
Nice college boy, eh?

[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:06.940]
They want to get mixed up in the family business.

[01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:10.160]
Now you want to go down a police cap and one because you slapped you in a face a little bit.

[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:10.520]
Eh?

[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:11.580]
What do you think this is?

[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:12.940]
The army where you shoot them a mile away?

[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:14.420]
You got to get a post like this.

[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:16.940]
But a thing your bloodhead brains all over your nice side of your leg suit.

[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:17.960]
Come in.

[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:20.080]
You're taking a sparey for it.

[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:20.880]
You're taking a very personal.

[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:23.640]
Just like some of these stupid emails.

[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:27.300]
Jason says, sorry to hear you're not feeling 100%.

[01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:28.700]
I don't even feel like 80%.

[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:30.220]
40, 80, 30.

[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:30.800]
About 30?

[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:32.240]
About 30, man.

[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:32.500]
Yeah.

[01:56:34.180 --> 01:56:36.860]
The reason you and George are often getting sick is in your genes.

[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:39.520]
I'm sure your parents were both Jews.

[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:42.120]
I mean, my George is Jewish.

[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:42.600]
Yeah.

[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:44.300]
Oh my God.

[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:45.300]
And so is my foreskin.

[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:47.480]
And their parents were both Jews and so on.

[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:51.640]
Any weaknesses you have in your gene strain is multiplied and compounded with every generation.

[01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:54.600]
The same rule applies to George.

[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:57.220]
It doesn't matter if it's Jew, genes or spict genes.

[01:56:58.100 --> 01:57:01.500]
George's kids, however, will be sick during the fact that he married out of his nationality.

[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:04.280]
Are your kids sick a lot?

[01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:04.880]
No.

[01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:05.620]
Neither of my.

[01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:06.760]
Well, you will be.

[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:08.420]
Court of Jason.

[01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:13.780]
This is really obvious with dogs.

[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:19.320]
You always hear pure breed dog owners having lots of health issues with their dogs, bad hips, cancer, bad eyes.

[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:21.600]
I'm a mutts of Jason.

[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:23.920]
Irish, Italian, Hungarian and Czech.

[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:26.760]
I get a cold every two or three years.

[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:28.180]
I've only been to the doctor for checkups.

[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:29.820]
I'm a married woman who's Colombian and Korean.

[01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:32.080]
My kids will be strong like a mule.

[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:35.640]
Hope you feel better, but it's completely out of your skin.

[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:37.220]
George's hands, you were born this way.

[01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:39.700]
It says, Tester Schmendrick.

[01:57:41.540 --> 01:57:45.600]
Jason, I don't want to say that you're a retard or an idiot or an anti-Semite, but nevertheless.

[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:47.780]
Uh, uh, uh.

[01:57:48.460 --> 01:57:49.140]
Dang you see?

[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:55.720]
Gary says, your problem with your eyes from when you saw Jim DeFetus on Channel 4.

[01:57:57.100 --> 01:57:59.620]
The only curious turn away from the TV really fast.

[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:02.160]
Please add the octomom to the pool.

[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.620]
Now, you put that pitch on there.

[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:05.040]
I don't hear that much about it anymore.

[01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:06.420]
No.

[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:07.900]
That's Gary at home, sir.

[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:08.720]
Octomomom?

[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:10.120]
Well, do as you please.

[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:11.000]
Oh.

[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:17.620]
Nice chunks of pineapple.

[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:20.900]
Okay.

[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.700]
So I got chunks going in, chunks coming out.

[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:23.400]
There you go.

[01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:24.720]
All chunky all day.

[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:27.400]
I bet you managed to make a link too happy about it.

[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:29.840]
I managed to make a AKA John CTR.

[01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:35.660]
Let's see what we got on there.

[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:37.500]
Mike Johnson, follow up.

[01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:39.100]
Well, this is Mike who, um.

[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:41.660]
He was a rose.

[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:43.600]
Remember that rose by the blue color ice cream?

[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:43.700]
Yep.

[01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:45.580]
That's like the same mark.

[01:58:47.660 --> 01:58:49.520]
And the fake Larry King is back.

[01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:54.160]
Went to Arnold's Royal Castle this week.

[01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:55.520]
There's a picture of it all lit up.

[01:58:56.820 --> 01:58:57.980]
The newly burgers were good.

[01:58:58.300 --> 01:59:00.420]
The pitch of the Birchbeer grade.

[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:03.060]
I could drink it by the gallery.

[01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:05.660]
He says, my only problem.

[01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:08.180]
There were no need of Rogers photos on the wall.

[01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:13.340]
He has his caricature of himself on the menu.

[01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:16.820]
Looking like Mel Kuiper, Jr.

[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:20.580]
The food is okay, but it'll make you, um.

[01:59:21.020 --> 01:59:21.260]
Schmidt.

[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:26.600]
He has something girls working in the counter.

[01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:28.540]
Wayne hides in the back.

[01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:31.140]
Whatever that all means.

[01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:31.980]
Do you understand what that is?

[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:33.280]
Wayne is hiding in the back.

[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:36.200]
Maybe he's doing that hot wife has in the back.

[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:38.280]
Or in some way.

[01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:40.600]
Oh no.

[01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:48.340]
Last chunk of pineapple, less piece of fruit.

[01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:49.240]
That's it.

[01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:49.860]
Okay.

[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:51.240]
Okay.

[01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:53.580]
I mean, okay.

[01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:57.500]
Well, that really helped, I think.

[01:59:57.600 --> 01:59:58.300]
I feel a lot better.

[01:59:58.920 --> 01:59:59.560]
Not good to connect.

[02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:06.280]
So how often is Jim DeFeeders on Channel 4?

[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:08.280]
Just he does like features, fat features.

[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:10.420]
Yeah, especially ports and things like that.

[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:11.620]
I guess I'm not keeping track.

[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:13.480]
I mean, I will if you want me to.

[02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:14.800]
I'll keep a log.

[02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:17.680]
No, but I don't have any emails from the fat.

[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:18.440]
Jim DeFeeders.

[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:21.300]
Oh, after I've seen him on TV over the weekend.

[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:21.780]
God.

[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:24.520]
What an embarrassment.

[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:29.260]
So Jesse Agver got blown out, huh?

[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:30.740]
Yep, blown up.

[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:33.040]
Yeah, I mean, how long did he do that show?

[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:33.600]
A couple of months?

[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:35.280]
Uh, whatever.

[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:36.620]
I don't know.

[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:38.200]
Like it matters?

[02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:40.700]
Could have been here 20 years.

[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:45.620]
No, but I'm just saying, not so now we got the SPN radio on all night from midnight till 6 in the morning.

[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:48.860]
Uh, yeah, sure that Joe has no lead in.

[02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:53.260]
That's that's what I'm saying.

[02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:58.720]
Penny slots making lots of sense in Missouri.

[02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:06.440]
See, I know that I'm never going to change my, well, accept it in the negative way.

[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:07.780]
You can change your life playing the slots.

[02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:12.620]
If you lose your ass, you know, one of those compulsive idiots who loses all their money.

[02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:21.540]
But yeah, even though I'm never going to win enough to change my life, it's not the point.

[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:23.660]
The idea is that everything is relative.

[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:28.180]
If I go win a thousand bucks or a few hundred bucks, seven, eight hundred, that's fine.

[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:28.780]
You know, it's nice.

[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:33.420]
If I'm going to go win like 16 cents, I'm not just a waste of time.

[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:34.300]
What's the point?

[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:38.060]
Yeah, killing time, right?

[02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:38.580]

[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:42.800]
Having fun, having fun, winning 16 cents.

[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:49.040]
Gambers may be cutting back like other consumers, but one thing they're not doing is pinching pennies.

[02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:55.780]
They're spending on penny gambling machines produced about a fourth of all slot machine revenue and a vandalized year and more in other states.

[02:01:56.860 --> 02:02:03.020]
In Missouri, one of few states were gambling revenue rose in 2008, more than half of all casino revenue came from penny slots.

[02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:06.920]
For many casinos, penny slots are producing the only kind of revenue that's rising.

[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:10.140]
Oh, that pineapples killed me.

[02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:11.960]
Getting flammy from it?

[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:12.920]
I'm what?

[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:14.500]
Are you getting flammy from it?

[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:15.660]
No, I'm getting raw.

[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:18.560]
Maybe it was sitting next to the honeydumelin.

[02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:21.680]
Well, pineapple raw grips up my mouth if I ate too much of it.

[02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:23.400]
Really? Yeah, it's acidity.

[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:31.460]
Gambers say they like the machines which were impractical before quiet paper payouts started replacing the tumbling bucketfuls of coins in a jackpot.

[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:33.780]
Because they can play longer for the same amount of money.

[02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:38.420]
No matter that casinos like penny slots because they're more lucrative for the house.

[02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:48.460]
It's all just for recreation said Kansas City resident core Logan 72 was playing a penny slot machine at ILO Capri and Kansas City on her 42nd wedding anniversary.

[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:53.080]
When you come here, don't expect to win if you put a lot of money in these, you're crazy. She said.

[02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:54.960]
Crazy.

[02:02:56.140 --> 02:03:05.320]
The four casinos in Kansas City like most across the country served mainly local markets as opposed to flying markets like Vegas, China's Macau and to some degree Atlantic City in Jersey.

[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:10.580]
That means most casinos depend heavily on low rollers who visit often low rollers.

[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:16.240]
Logan said she hadn't expected to win when she and her husband walked in was up a hundred bucks after three hours.

[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:18.600]
You wouldn't mind that.

[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:23.740]
No. Of course you got that big pay raise coming in the car.

[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:25.200]
Yeah.

[02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:28.140]
So that jackass actually said to you, you still here?

[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:37.220]
And did you expect like laughter or something? What do you expect?

[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:38.660]
No, I don't know.

[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:43.260]
I would have gotten up dropped my drawers.

[02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:52.600]
Sure, yeah, that's exactly what I'm going to face my ass in his direction and just squirted a gigantic load of wild bloody diary all over his ass.

[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:55.340]
That's what I would have done. I'll go eat some glass.

[02:03:56.360 --> 02:03:59.000]
Yeah, so I'll take the global out of my ass. I'll take that.

[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:01.640]
That's what Mr. Wang told me.

[02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:09.900]
Affordability is why people love them said Frank Legato, a slum machine expert editor of Las Vegas based global gaming Venice magazine.

[02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:16.380]
Cosinas just love them because the average bets are the same as the quarter and dollar games, but the house edges bigger on these games.

[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:23.940]
People playing penny machines are not concerned about that. They just want to have fun and play a long time with little money.

[02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:38.100]
The play penny slots, which include video poker machines and slots with colorful video narratives, as well as machines that look and operate more like traditional one-hour bandits, gamblers place electronic bets in one or something sent increments.

[02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:44.980]
It's chopped off the machines allow wages anywhere from a penny to $10 or more per spin.

[02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:47.400]
Yeah, penny my ass.

[02:04:49.580 --> 02:04:53.220]
Gamblers feed the machines cash or credit cards in some states. Oh, can you imagine that?

[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.360]
Oh, yeah, slot machines with credit credit card on. Sure.

[02:04:58.860 --> 02:05:00.080]
You got to be crazy.

[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:07.520]
I think that pineapple just finished me off. Maybe Paco put something in it.

[02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:09.380]
Yeah.

[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:16.500]
And any winnings are paid out with a paper ticket that can be redeemed, redeemed, a cashier's cage or any machine used to place more bets.

[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:28.120]
With 3D videographics, bonus bins and familiar storylines like Star Wars or Wizard of Oz, the machines provide a form of active participatory entertainment that wasn't available with the old three real still slots.

[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:35.720]
That makes them especially big among people who go to casinos for a social aspect.

[02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:39.940]
Oh, that's why I go there to smell the smelly Chinese one.

[02:05:41.080 --> 02:05:47.780]
I'm just here to have fun since Stephanie Wright 41 of Kansas City. She played Blazing Sevens at the Ilock Capri.

[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:53.940]
Oh, that pineapple just tore my life up.

[02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:58.620]
My boyfriend plays cards. I like to sit and play these while he does that. She said.

[02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:04.860]
Wright used to play quarters in a roughly weekly visits to Kansas City casinos before she got hooked on the penny slots.

[02:06:05.260 --> 02:06:10.800]
If you don't want to bet if you want to bet the max you can, but I go low, she said sometimes I get excited and go big once in a while.

[02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:14.440]
I usually don't bet that much, but once in a while she gets excited and she goes low.

[02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:17.180]
Oh, me. You're listening to your larger.

[02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:19.400]
It's the one to two hours.

[02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:24.560]
I'll give up drinking and prefer to think in.

[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:26.400]
You know I won't have fun.

[02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:33.400]
I'll give up chocolate for another 40 days.

[02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:38.900]
To give up smoking I will need some help so I will pray.

[02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:43.840]
Turn my computer on, but I'll have to be sure.

[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:54.820]
I'll give up.

[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:02.140]
I'll give up.

[02:07:02.380 --> 02:07:03.760]
I'll give up.

[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:03.760]

[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:03.760]

[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:03.760]

[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:03.760]

[02:07:03.860 --> 02:07:04.920]
I'll give up.

[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:13.820]
I'll give up.

[02:07:13.820 --> 02:07:16.480]
I found in the other room that Paco left me.

[02:07:16.980 --> 02:07:17.600]
I don't know.

[02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:20.120]
How do you like that?

[02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:24.000]
What are these brown olives?

[02:07:25.380 --> 02:07:26.640]
I don't know.

[02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:28.620]
The ones with the pits in them.

[02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:29.940]
Olives?

[02:07:32.020 --> 02:07:32.460]
Colomati.

[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:35.760]
I'll take your word for it.

[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:36.600]
Don't have a name.

[02:07:37.580 --> 02:07:41.660]
The little dark brown ones.

[02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:42.980]
The crap.

[02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:45.740]
I'm eating them though.

[02:07:46.140 --> 02:07:46.700]
I like the green ones.

[02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:47.940]
Me too.

[02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:56.080]
I need some sceempe.

[02:07:56.160 --> 02:07:59.800]
I'll have some sauce on it.

[02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:00.980]
Conte al sauce?

[02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:04.340]
Good stuff.

[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:07.980]
I don't feel so bad about you getting that KFC stuff.

[02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:14.040]
I don't get fed during the show.

[02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:16.440]
This was a real surprise.

[02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:20.500]
Anyway, let's get back to business.

[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:23.080]
We only got 40 minutes and I'm out of here.

[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:24.660]
I'm history.

[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:28.640]
How do you think I'm going to be feeling by Thursday?

[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:29.620]
I don't know.

[02:08:29.780 --> 02:08:33.260]
Am I going to be feeling by Thursday?

[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:34.040]
Yeah.

[02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:35.420]
As in, you better be feeling all right?

[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:36.820]
Or what?

[02:08:37.140 --> 02:08:41.080]
Or you'll get another email talking about how sick you are all the time because you're a Jew?

[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:42.840]
Yeah.

[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:43.560]
Screw him.

[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:46.840]
He's a real man.

[02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:49.480]
What a jackass.

[02:08:52.180 --> 02:08:53.120]
363 votes on the poll.

[02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:55.060]
I'll read it one more time before I get out of here.

[02:08:58.340 --> 02:09:00.140]
Larry loves himself with a link.

[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:01.260]
A link.

[02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:01.840]
Delete.

[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:02.720]
Yeah.

[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:05.000]
As soon as I get a link, delete.

[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:10.200]
By the way, congratulations to Javier for winning those heat tickets that we were doing on that online contest.

[02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:11.160]
Oh, nice going Javier.

[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:20.120]
I bet it's not the same Javier that was the Godfather's guy.

[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:23.820]
I went back to WS News a hundred years ago and Kendall, who don't have a God, Javier.

[02:09:26.060 --> 02:09:27.460]
He was a beautiful man.

[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:30.600]
A beautiful young man.

[02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:34.480]
And I think he and his whole family went to jail or something.

[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:37.180]
Something unsavory like that.

[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:44.060]
I think I just dropped a piece of olive down my shirt pocket.

[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:46.260]
So you'll have it for later.

[02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:49.060]
The worst is when you drop ice down your shirt pocket.

[02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:50.500]
You ever do that?

[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:52.680]
I've done my shirt.

[02:09:53.620 --> 02:09:55.140]
I don't have a lot of shirt pockets anymore.

[02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:56.120]
Why not?

[02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:58.640]
I don't wear those kinds of shirts as a rule.

[02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:01.080]
Are there old man shirts?

[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:01.700]
Is that what you're saying?

[02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:03.620]
No, I just have a lot of t-shirts.

[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:04.320]
I wear t-shirts.

[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:07.500]
Some of them have pockets and sometimes I'll wear a shirt with a pocket but it's rare.

[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:10.940]
And what about the old pocket rocket?

[02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:12.560]
I can't take that everywhere.

[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:16.780]
On revert shard, baby, the pocket rocket.

[02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:17.980]
So the hocks lost lives now.

[02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:18.840]
That's bad news.

[02:10:23.300 --> 02:10:27.760]
I mean, when your teams are all out, you've got to root for the team that looks good.

[02:10:29.020 --> 02:10:29.420]
Blackhocks.

[02:10:29.460 --> 02:10:30.720]
I don't think anybody eat any more of this.

[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:33.700]
Got a big thing of crab meat here.

[02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:35.200]
I like crab meat.

[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:37.480]
No, I mean, it's a lobster or crab meat.

[02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:38.120]
What do you think?

[02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:40.140]
Both?

[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:42.480]
Hmm.

[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:45.820]
I don't know, but I'm going to pass on the rest.

[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:48.400]
It looks like a nasty fish.

[02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:50.780]
Well, that's great.

[02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:53.260]
Oh.

[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:01.240]
If you get to feeling I'm not like 100% of what's going on here today, you're right.

[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:04.220]
It's like an out-of-body experience.

[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:09.380]
Dana says, I was listening to your archives when you were on holiday.

[02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:13.200]
I noticed you're disgusted by all fellow radio people.

[02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:14.820]
Do you really hate them that much?

[02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:17.520]
Joe Bell is the one you have the biggest problem with.

[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:19.800]
Why is this Dana Hall?

[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:21.380]
Because he's an ass clown.

[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:23.080]
Because he's a butcher.

[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:25.260]
He destroys lives.

[02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:26.380]
He destroys radio stations.

[02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:28.200]
That's why Dana, that's the answer for you.

[02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:31.080]
And I don't have that much problem with radio people.

[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:37.200]
How many radio people do I really have a problem with besides Mo and Joey Reynolds?

[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:40.240]
I don't know.

[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:43.040]
I don't break B. Dill and Sid Rosenberg.

[02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:45.000]
Well, I don't even know him.

[02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:45.500]
Oh, okay.

[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:52.320]
When you say I have a problem with somebody that you assume, it's somebody that you know.

[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:56.360]
Not just somebody you think is a bad person or sucks on the year or both.

[02:11:57.580 --> 02:11:58.460]
In Sid's case.

[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:05.240]
So that's the latest rumor that George said on a starting morning's next Monday on 790.

[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:08.240]
And that maybe syndicated talk between 10 and whatever.

[02:12:08.460 --> 02:12:10.040]
I guess they thrown in the towel here midday.

[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:10.700]
Yeah.

[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:16.020]
And you notice that I and Z with their big all sports, Fox sports, whatever it is.

[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:17.300]
There isn't one comment.

[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:20.220]
And that's because it's all syndicated crap.

[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:21.400]
They don't have one local show.

[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:23.540]
There's anybody on there who anybody cares about.

[02:12:23.820 --> 02:12:27.440]
And there's no comments about 940 with that gigantic signal.

[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:35.680]
There is that would be like somebody bringing a bar of gold of pure solid gold and bringing into your home,

[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:37.360]
placing it on your dining room table.

[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:41.820]
And you put it under the toilet and just leave it there.

[02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:42.520]
Yeah.

[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:46.180]
That's what it's like cheap channel destroying that frequency.

[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:50.980]
If it failed before, we know it can sure fail again.

[02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:51.460]
And it will.

[02:12:52.580 --> 02:12:53.000]
No, no.

[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:53.140]
No, no.

[02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:53.600]
No, no, no.

[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:54.000]
No, no, no.

[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:54.740]
I don't see you talking about now.

[02:12:57.180 --> 02:12:57.520]
What?

[02:12:58.600 --> 02:12:59.520]
I said, how's that pineapple?

[02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:06.020]
David says in the Walgreens records, the first of all, there are no Walgreens here and there's no records here.

[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:07.680]
I don't think there's any records there anymore either.

[02:13:07.900 --> 02:13:08.240]
No, no, no.

[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:08.640]
That's not enough.

[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:13.680]
Look for the Chaloreum eye wash to kill the scratch irritation.

[02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:15.220]
I don't have any scratch irritation.

[02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:17.860]
This is not a cure.

[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:18.860]
We'll just give you eyes relief.

[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:19.680]
Let it soak from it.

[02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:20.340]
Keep your eyes closed.

[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:21.040]
Long time listener.

[02:13:21.300 --> 02:13:21.860]
Well, thanks, David.

[02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:23.180]
But I got no serious there.

[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:24.980]
If the flame would go away, I'd be okay.

[02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:29.960]
I think that crap that I stuck in my eye, in fact, maybe now is the time for a couple more drops.

[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:31.020]
It said four times a day.

[02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:35.740]
So during the break, I think I'm going to shimmer a couple more eye drops in each eye.

[02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:40.860]
And thanks to Dr. George for giving me the real way to do that.

[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:46.460]
Because I thought the only way to do it is like you lift your top lid open and put your head back.

[02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:47.800]
All my life and...

[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:48.120]
Hope to put aim.

[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:53.200]
I knew this chick who was an eye doctor and she said, no, no, no, you're doing it all wrong, you idiot.

[02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:55.640]
You're sticking in the wrong place?

[02:13:55.940 --> 02:13:57.780]
Yeah, she said, here's how you do it.

[02:13:58.380 --> 02:13:59.000]
I'll bet.

[02:13:59.240 --> 02:13:59.580]
If I'd wow.

[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:00.860]
I could never would have thought of that.

[02:14:01.780 --> 02:14:02.200]
Wow.

[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:03.880]
That was up 66 and a half points.

[02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:05.780]
It's a great day for America, baby.

[02:14:06.260 --> 02:14:07.900]
You're not thinking neobodges.

[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:09.980]
He was his ward.

[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:11.140]
Not his pedophile.

[02:14:12.820 --> 02:14:14.420]
Today on TMZ.

[02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:20.640]
A California lawmaker says legalizing marijuana and taxing it would generate up to a billion dollars for the Treasury.

[02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:23.980]
Governor Schwarzenegger, what do you think about legalizing pot in California?

[02:14:24.540 --> 02:14:26.120]
They decided to get a bikini wax.

[02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:26.720]
What?

[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:28.940]
And this is why I'm doing drugs.

[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:30.580]
Are you already high?

[02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:32.120]
Doesn't elephant in the room.

[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:32.660]
Where?

[02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:33.760]
Right behind you.

[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:34.200]
Here?

[02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:35.500]
Yes, over here, yes.

[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:37.120]
Oh, yeah, I see it.

[02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:37.940]
Oh, I see it.

[02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:38.960]
Yeah, we all see it.

[02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:39.880]
We have to stop it.

[02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:41.500]
Why don't you just ask him to leave?

[02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:44.240]
I've asked him and he said to no.

[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:46.260]
Many times to me, no, no, no.

[02:14:46.260 --> 02:14:47.960]
So what are you going to do now, Rambo?

[02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:49.500]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's that?

[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:50.360]
Who was he 9 millimeter?

[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:52.800]
Make my day.

[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:54.860]
Um, that's not even your line.

[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:57.740]
Oh, today on TMZ.

[02:14:58.260 --> 02:15:02.300]
114 to 560 WQA and we got to big ol' but two we got Georgia at 140.

[02:15:04.340 --> 02:15:04.740]
Ish.

[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:08.540]
Well, I mean, I'm going to do that break at 140 and then break out.

[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:11.480]
I got a lot of stuff to do, man.

[02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:12.420]
A lot of business.

[02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:13.480]
I'm busy.

[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:14.660]
I'm really busy today.

[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:17.960]
Then tomorrow I'm busy early in the morning and then all the way through.

[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:22.360]
The question and priorities, you know, I mean, when they're paying you half price,

[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:23.820]
you give them half a loaf, you know what I'm saying?

[02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:24.540]
Half-ass.

[02:15:25.060 --> 02:15:25.540]
That's right.

[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:28.500]
Brandon says, I'll say this about you being sick.

[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:30.940]
You're lucky in the sense that you just have to roll into bed to go to work.

[02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:32.980]
How about roll out of bed?

[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:36.300]
For the rest of us, we have to struggle with getting dressed,

[02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:39.020]
driving to the office, dealing with all the crap of the people in the office.

[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:39.740]
That's right, Brandon.

[02:15:41.260 --> 02:15:42.960]
It's one of the good things about being here.

[02:15:43.700 --> 02:15:45.280]
I roll out of bed, sick as a dog.

[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:48.880]
Rob Sanford, I'm trying to remember which crank he was the other day.

[02:15:51.420 --> 02:15:54.120]
That was a crank name used by one of our regular chronics.

[02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:56.960]
I forget which, Neil orgasming over food, it says.

[02:15:57.420 --> 02:15:58.480]
You're eating just now.

[02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:00.640]
It sounds like someone who's completely a sexual act.

[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:01.060]
Yeah.

[02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:02.000]
Like in Fatsa.

[02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:08.880]
I warned you about overeating once.

[02:16:09.980 --> 02:16:11.420]
Food is first survival, not pleasure.

[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:13.540]
Maybe take a hint from flea who's a vegetarian.

[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:14.700]
No, I don't think so.

[02:16:16.260 --> 02:16:17.720]
Did you know they're fleas of vegetarian?

[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:18.660]
Yes.

[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:20.020]
And what's your take on that?

[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:22.020]
It's not for me, thank you.

[02:16:22.300 --> 02:16:24.440]
It's very similar to your sexual choices there.

[02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:24.920]
Not for me.

[02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:25.800]
Good luck to you.

[02:16:26.060 --> 02:16:26.540]
Have fun with that.

[02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:29.080]
I don't think you're sick though.

[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:30.940]
I think we are witnessing your last days.

[02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:32.460]
You've never been sick like this before.

[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:33.600]
Something is wrong.

[02:16:34.380 --> 02:16:35.520]
Something is wrong.

[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:36.960]
He's got a cold.

[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:38.280]
Something is wrong.

[02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:40.780]
Yeah, Rob, I forget.

[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:43.540]
I forget that fake name was used by one of the chronics the other day.

[02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:45.900]
So that would explain it.

[02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:47.340]
Somebody who's...

[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:49.200]
Little like that.

[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:50.880]
But then again.

[02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:52.080]
Here's Rick James Bitch.

[02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:55.100]
Hey, Neil, if you ever got an autograph from Larry King,

[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:56.680]
hope your big nose feels better.

[02:16:57.780 --> 02:16:59.260]
First of all, I don't have a big nose.

[02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:01.320]
And secondly, why would I want an autograph from Larry King?

[02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:05.280]
Would you want an autograph from Larry King?

[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:06.600]
I don't want anything from Larry King.

[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:07.400]
Maybe some money.

[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:08.320]
Big bag of money.

[02:17:08.780 --> 02:17:09.200]
Yeah, oh yeah.

[02:17:09.300 --> 02:17:10.760]
He's going to give you a big bag of money, all right.

[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:13.680]
Not $50, maybe $0.50.

[02:17:13.940 --> 02:17:14.580]
I doubt it though.

[02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:15.720]
$0.30, man.

[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:16.000]
$0.30.

[02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:18.620]
Here's that poll.

[02:17:18.780 --> 02:17:19.920]
The Dow is up 70 points.

[02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:21.240]
It's cooking with gas.

[02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:24.540]
384 votes.

[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:25.180]
But that's weak.

[02:17:25.580 --> 02:17:26.860]
That is really weak.

[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:30.120]
We're going to just push over 400 here.

[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:37.100]
The most overhyped person, place or thing in America is American Idol 88.

The White House Dua 18.

[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:53.640]
Does that Dua have a name?

[02:17:53.700 --> 02:17:54.280]
Do we know the name?

[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:56.500]
A bow.

[02:17:57.400 --> 02:17:57.720]
Bow.

[02:17:58.060 --> 02:17:58.220]
Bow.

[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:00.880]
Or like a bow, Bobama.

[02:18:00.940 --> 02:18:01.440]
Bobama.

[02:18:01.660 --> 02:18:02.940]
Mama, mama, your mama.

[02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:05.240]

[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:09.500]
They're all whipped up on these sports hall stations.

[02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:11.760]
All the ass clowns.

And the obesity epidemic.

[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:21.980]
Only one.

[02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:25.900]
I don't see no fat people.

[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:32.720]
Well, let's see what Cliff and Kendall has to say.

[02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:34.960]
He's usually got something worthwhile to say.

[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:39.520]
There are like four or five people on emails who have something to say.

[02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:40.500]
Brandon is one.

[02:18:40.660 --> 02:18:41.560]
Cliff and Kendall is one.

[02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:48.020]
My buddy, Bo's, whatever his name, Bo's Florida with the dead people.

[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:50.160]
All the orbits.

[02:18:51.340 --> 02:18:52.740]
Don't have any orbits for today.

[02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:54.280]
Boy, you sure had a lot to catch up on yesterday.

[02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:55.420]
A lot of people croaking.

[02:18:57.340 --> 02:18:58.060]
And don't worry.

[02:18:58.120 --> 02:18:58.660]
It's just a cold.

[02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:01.060]
I'm not going to, I just, I told him, I'll live Joe Bell.

[02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:02.000]
That's my golden life.

[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:02.860]
Dance on his grave.

[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:05.200]
I have a big smelly dump on it.

[02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:09.980]
Hey, Joey, smell this for eternity.

[02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:11.180]
Hmm.

[02:19:12.580 --> 02:19:15.320]
That thing with that, uh, broad with the water pouring out of her nose.

[02:19:15.500 --> 02:19:18.200]
That's, I don't know whether that's funny or just tragic.

[02:19:18.860 --> 02:19:19.220]
Both?

[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:20.300]
What does that thing called?

[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:21.160]
The Nettie Pot.

[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:24.120]
I never, in my life, I never heard of such a thing.

[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:25.100]
It's an old-timey thing.

[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:27.620]
Yeah.

[02:19:28.060 --> 02:19:30.040]
Maybe even older than you.

[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:31.500]
Oh, that's old.

[02:19:32.860 --> 02:19:34.420]
Cliff and Kendall says, welcome back, Neil.

[02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:36.680]
I was greatly amused by the T-Bagger's demonstration last week.

[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:39.800]
The crowds look like a cross between AARP and a clan meeting.

[02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:44.040]
Where were these outrage jackasses when Bush drove us into this ditch?

[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:47.840]
During all the hype about the T-Bagger's, I noticed a real problem on the radio.

[02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:50.640]
There was very little or no opposing view being discussed.

[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.320]
The only thing you heard on the air was rabid right-wing opinions.

[02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:56.380]
Well, isn't that basically what you hear on the air now anyway?

[02:19:57.060 --> 02:19:57.600]
For a long time.

[02:19:58.880 --> 02:19:59.060]
Yep.

[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:00.480]
That is a big problem.

[02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:05.300]
When 940 Wions, he was progressive, you could listen to a different point of view other than conservative.

[02:20:05.820 --> 02:20:09.260]
When it comes to winning minds, the availability of differing ideas is so very important.

[02:20:09.500 --> 02:20:13.580]
Although you can access progressive radio online, most people listen to the radio in the car.

[02:20:14.220 --> 02:20:19.760]
Most people don't want to go through the effort and expenses satellite radio or all the hoop jumping required to live stream through a smartphone.

[02:20:20.260 --> 02:20:24.180]
Your average Joe or Jane Six pack just wants to get in the car and turn on the radio.

[02:20:25.340 --> 02:20:29.600]
I doubt the Democrats will win South Florida the next presidential election if there's no opposing voice on the radio.

[02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:31.340]
Well, there was no opposing voice on the radio.

[02:20:31.540 --> 02:20:36.260]
I mean, if you think Skirra America won Florida for Obama, your dream in Cliff.

[02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:38.860]
Is he dreaming or what?

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:39.540]
He's dreaming.

[02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:40.560]
Skirra America.

[02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:43.100]
They didn't have enough listeners to put into a phone booth. That's why they're gone.

[02:20:43.420 --> 02:20:45.620]
And once they're gone, they're gone.

[02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:47.420]
They ain't coming back.

[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:55.220]
Mike Johnson is back who absolutely never has anything to say.

[02:20:55.320 --> 02:20:55.860]
Why is he back?

[02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:56.360]
I don't know.

[02:20:56.900 --> 02:20:57.520]
Something to do.

[02:20:57.680 --> 02:20:58.760]
Keep them off the streets, I guess.

[02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:01.640]
Neil, two items for your review.

[02:21:01.860 --> 02:21:05.100]
This is the one who was with the blue bell ice cream earlier.

[02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:05.560]
Yes.

[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:06.940]
He was erozed.

[02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:08.020]
Yeah.

[02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:09.040]
Remember that?

[02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:10.440]
Maybe he was famosed.

[02:21:10.740 --> 02:21:10.940]
Ooh.

[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:15.940]
If there was a God with a research, the thing is famosa.

[02:21:17.640 --> 02:21:18.620]
Two items for your review.

[02:21:18.860 --> 02:21:21.100]
One, whenever I'm sick, Vicks vapor, vapor rub.

[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:24.860]
This guy's just got a little, it's vapor rub, not vapor rub, Mike.

[02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:27.160]
Always helps clear up the mong.

[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:29.640]
Schmaring that on your chest under your nose will clear you up quickly.

[02:21:29.780 --> 02:21:30.280]
No, it will not.

[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:33.980]
I used it last night and the night before and it helps a little bit,

[02:21:33.980 --> 02:21:35.660]
but it won't clear anything up quickly.

[02:21:37.140 --> 02:21:38.860]
You think it will clear, clear you up quickly?

[02:21:39.780 --> 02:21:40.480]
I don't know, quickly.

[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:41.720]
It'll feel good though.

[02:21:41.900 --> 02:21:42.200]
It smells good.

[02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:43.260]
Oh yeah, smells great.

[02:21:43.380 --> 02:21:44.180]
I love the smell of Vicks.

[02:21:45.660 --> 02:21:48.420]
Two is a follow up to the blue bell question earlier this morning.

[02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:50.400]
And by the way, there was no response to that.

[02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:52.460]
Nobody gives a flying crap about blue bell ice cream.

[02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:56.340]
I'm hoping some of your male or e-mailers can help me figure out how to attack

[02:21:56.340 --> 02:21:58.740]
the half-gallon blue bell ice cream of their choice.

[02:21:58.840 --> 02:21:59.640]
I'm still but a rookie.

[02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:00.720]
How do you attack there?

[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.060]
See, this is a guy trying to be a clown.

[02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:04.980]
Try to be a comedian.

[02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:07.900]
How do you attack the buffet at the Amel Coast Neal?

[02:22:07.980 --> 02:22:08.600]
How do you do this?

[02:22:08.660 --> 02:22:10.600]
How do you attack the ice cream with a spoon?

[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:13.360]
That's how I attack it.

[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:16.140]
It's about like a battle cry that you shout while you go at it.

[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:16.420]
Yeah.

[02:22:20.420 --> 02:22:23.020]
Or once in a while, you can go like that.

[02:22:23.460 --> 02:22:25.160]
It works like a charm every time.

[02:22:27.220 --> 02:22:28.640]
They hate this pool, by the way.

[02:22:28.660 --> 02:22:29.720]
I thought this pool was okay.

[02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:30.340]
That's fine.

[02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:31.720]
They don't like it.

[02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:34.820]
387 is a week total, week.

[02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:36.880]
George Ann is back.

[02:22:36.980 --> 02:22:39.800]
I don't mean the email twice in one day, but what happened to Jesse Agler

[02:22:39.800 --> 02:22:40.760]
in the early morning show?

[02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:43.020]
Fired, cost-cutting.

[02:22:44.440 --> 02:22:46.000]
Now it's ESPN AM.

[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:46.820]
Wow, it sucks.

[02:22:47.020 --> 02:22:48.720]
If you talk about this before, I'm sorry to bring it up.

[02:22:48.920 --> 02:22:49.980]
Now it's just more of the same.

[02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:50.400]
That's all.

[02:22:51.340 --> 02:22:53.000]
Pretty soon everybody's going to be fired.

[02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:57.620]
Everybody in every station on every newspaper and every magazine, every TV station,

[02:22:58.960 --> 02:22:59.780]
every company.

[02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:04.300]
Why are they showing us Chris Reeves again on CNN?

[02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:07.420]
I don't know, maybe it's some anniversary or something.

[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:09.120]
That was at 56 points.

[02:23:11.780 --> 02:23:15.580]
I can't believe you're such an unbelievably bad judge of talents as Joe.

[02:23:16.380 --> 02:23:18.540]
If you can't see that Flea is a thousand times better than...

[02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:19.080]
Oh yeah, Joe.

[02:23:19.640 --> 02:23:20.280]
Joe Bell.

[02:23:20.740 --> 02:23:21.440]
Better than George.

[02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:23.520]
You have more than the flu you've got a mental disorder.

[02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:25.980]
Please give her that depressing spick, sign Joe.

[02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:28.240]
Probably the real Joe Bell.

[02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:30.280]
And the answer is no chance.

[02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:36.320]
You say that now, but if he dies, what is this?

[02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:45.120]
Oh yeah, if he dies, Joe Bell dies, you'll be shocked and will be the first one crying at the funeral.

[02:23:45.420 --> 02:23:46.540]
Yeah, let's give it a try.

[02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:48.720]
Let's test this one out.

[02:23:48.780 --> 02:23:49.180]
What do you say?

[02:23:53.980 --> 02:23:59.640]
He is the most evil subhuman creature I've encountered in this business in all my 500 years in it.

[02:23:59.900 --> 02:24:01.440]
What, that takes him a lot of territory.

[02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:06.620]
It's one thing to be just inept.

[02:24:07.020 --> 02:24:08.560]
You know, some people can't help it if they're inept.

[02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:11.840]
But inept an evil, that's a bad combination.

[02:24:12.300 --> 02:24:12.660]
You know what I mean?

[02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:13.320]
Yep.

[02:24:16.060 --> 02:24:17.700]
Oh, here's one from David Friedman.

[02:24:17.700 --> 02:24:19.280]
Oh, guess who David Friedman is?

[02:24:20.980 --> 02:24:21.520]
Hi, Neil.

[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:22.660]
No, I don't listen to you anymore.

[02:24:22.660 --> 02:24:23.580]
Nor does my friend Jeff.

[02:24:23.580 --> 02:24:24.780]
Hi, how are you?

[02:24:24.980 --> 02:24:26.020]
You still have your head?

[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:28.260]
Oh, you still shave your head, live in Canada?

[02:24:29.700 --> 02:24:33.360]
Does George Fernandez Rodriguez, Bernadette, is a force to work for you?

[02:24:33.620 --> 02:24:34.460]
He sucks, by the way.

[02:24:34.700 --> 02:24:37.300]
But I wish him the best considering the circumstances he came from.

[02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:39.360]
Please leave him all your worldly possessions.

[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:41.340]
You probably will not live him anyway.

[02:24:41.980 --> 02:24:44.160]
So I quickly emailed to you to say you suck.

[02:24:44.740 --> 02:24:46.140]
You're an old man now.

[02:24:46.280 --> 02:24:49.140]
When I started listening to you, 30 plus years ago, you were relatively young.

[02:24:49.140 --> 02:24:49.980]
I missed those days.

[02:24:50.540 --> 02:24:51.720]
I'll tell Jeff you said hello.

[02:24:51.820 --> 02:24:53.320]
He lives in Pember of Pine still.

[02:24:53.820 --> 02:24:55.040]
Did I say that you suck?

[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:55.840]
Not really.

[02:24:56.020 --> 02:24:58.820]
If you have to population had your intelligence, this will be much better.

[02:24:58.880 --> 02:24:59.220]
Love you.

[02:25:00.380 --> 02:25:01.780]
Lyle, aka David F.

[02:25:01.860 --> 02:25:02.980]
Is that for the old Lyle?

[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:03.740]
Never Lyle?

[02:25:03.860 --> 02:25:03.980]
Sure.

[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:06.360]
Dave Friedman, crazy person.

[02:25:08.180 --> 02:25:10.980]
I suck, I'm great, I'm good, I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad, whatever.

[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:12.560]
Just go the hell away, that's all.

[02:25:13.380 --> 02:25:15.580]
You and your boyfriend, Fat Dave Hyde, who splattered the walls.

[02:25:16.020 --> 02:25:18.400]
You know, something too bad Joe Bell wasn't working there back then.

[02:25:19.420 --> 02:25:21.380]
That would have been an assignment for him.

[02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:22.220]
Oh, Neil!

[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:22.960]
Neil!

[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:24.140]
I'll be right down the show.

[02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:29.380]
Where the mother was going to hang from trees and play banjo.

[02:25:29.580 --> 02:25:32.620]
You got some cool old, a station on.

[02:25:32.980 --> 02:25:34.500]
You banged old, radio.

[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:38.720]
Now as Nore's, Caroline goes.

[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:41.800]
Raleigh's a big city, you know.

[02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:45.060]
And that's where the beesleaves had to go.

[02:25:45.540 --> 02:25:48.120]
For jolly, Riley, Joe, you ferry.

[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:50.460]
A new jam.

[02:25:52.100 --> 02:25:53.780]
He'll do what he can.

[02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:57.080]
Shake your hand like a friend.

[02:25:57.800 --> 02:25:59.720]
Then quickly walk away.

[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:03.780]
They had Joe go to five-six-oh.

[02:26:03.780 --> 02:26:07.800]
With ratings and the toilet bowl to get those.

[02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:12.220]
Playings, portable mose, an order in control.

[02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:17.740]
And then so, jolly, Riley, Joe, a bug dealer.

[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:20.960]
And in the note, he lets mose go.

[02:26:21.380 --> 02:26:24.860]
And here's what blows his gildy, his own show.

[02:26:26.060 --> 02:26:28.140]
He'll make a big change.

[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:30.960]
And rearrange.

[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:34.240]
It's worse or the same.

[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:37.260]
He hasn't done a thing.

[02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:41.300]
For what goes on the air at two.

[02:26:41.780 --> 02:26:44.080]
Joe don't have a stinkin' clue.

[02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:45.180]
About a four.

[02:26:45.740 --> 02:26:47.440]
Not mad essentially blows.

[02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:49.400]
Sport all radio.

[02:26:50.420 --> 02:26:53.640]
The GM of five-six-oh.

[02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:55.800]
Jolly, Riley, Joe.

[02:26:56.340 --> 02:26:56.820]
Oi!

[02:26:57.280 --> 02:26:58.700]
Okay, 131 at QAM.

[02:26:58.700 --> 02:26:59.980]
Here's one from Terry.

[02:27:00.260 --> 02:27:02.280]
I bought Bluebell a couple of times when it was on sale.

[02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:05.160]
The containers are larger than most of the brands.

[02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:06.360]
And the flavors are not bad.

[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:10.820]
My main complaint is that the ice cream itself is on the water recite.

[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:13.020]
Oh, I hate watery ice cream like a hug and aes.

[02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:16.000]
I think public's premium is better quality ice cream.

[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.660]
And definitely a better deal when it's on sale, too, for one.

[02:27:18.900 --> 02:27:20.640]
There's your take on Bluebell from Terry.

[02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:23.660]
Okay.

[02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:24.660]
Never had any yet or not.

[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:24.880]
No.

[02:27:26.780 --> 02:27:27.180]
Interested?

[02:27:27.420 --> 02:27:27.640]
No.

[02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:28.420]
I'm not either.

[02:27:29.300 --> 02:27:31.880]
If I'm going to do ice cream, I mean, I've got, you know, nestlies.

[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:35.940]
I mean, I'm interested, but not enough to go like looking for it, you know.

[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:36.240]
Right.

[02:27:36.580 --> 02:27:37.920]
Somebody brought some to the station.

[02:27:38.060 --> 02:27:39.220]
I would be very interested.

[02:27:39.860 --> 02:27:40.040]
Oh.

[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:42.060]
Maybe tomorrow.

[02:27:42.940 --> 02:27:43.280]
Maybe.

[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:45.800]
Maybe Mike Johnson with all his idiotic emails.

[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:46.880]
Maybe he'll take time out.

[02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:47.320]
Maybe.

[02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:48.820]
Oh, here's the fake Adam Kirschner.

[02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:51.960]
I know it's fake because it's not his email, right?

[02:27:52.380 --> 02:27:53.960]
Can you add Howard Stern to the list?

[02:27:54.100 --> 02:27:54.180]
Sure.

[02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:54.520]
Go ahead.

[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:55.960]
Good suggestion.

[02:27:56.660 --> 02:27:57.280]
Go ahead.

[02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:00.800]
Requests for the weather girls dedicated to Alice Randshel and Brian Norcross.

[02:28:01.260 --> 02:28:01.660]
Thanks, buddy.

[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:02.740]
The fake Adam Kirschner.

[02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:04.560]
Oh.

[02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:06.860]
Eight minutes.

[02:28:07.220 --> 02:28:09.480]
Then I'm going to, we'll play that break in minutes so you.

[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:10.880]
Okay.

[02:28:10.940 --> 02:28:11.400]
Can you handle that?

[02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:11.720]
Yeah.

[02:28:12.420 --> 02:28:14.740]
And I realized that's a couple of minutes more than I said, but.

[02:28:15.860 --> 02:28:16.100]
It's all right.

[02:28:16.100 --> 02:28:17.740]
What would be the point of coming back after the break?

[02:28:17.900 --> 02:28:18.160]
It's all right.

[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:19.540]
Is it all right?

[02:28:19.980 --> 02:28:20.320]
It's all right.

[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:21.160]
It's okay.

[02:28:21.820 --> 02:28:25.100]
See, that's why we have George around because he's a willing participant.

[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:25.900]
Yeah.

[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:27.080]
I'll just spend right over.

[02:28:27.580 --> 02:28:30.000]
I sent him a text message in the morning saying I'm sick as a dog.

[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:30.660]
I won't be in the day.

[02:28:30.660 --> 02:28:31.340]
He'll say, okay.

[02:28:31.740 --> 02:28:32.400]
Feel better.

[02:28:32.980 --> 02:28:33.320]
Yeah.

[02:28:35.220 --> 02:28:38.900]
As opposed to like Joe Bell, who'd say, how come Rogers ain't on again today?

[02:28:39.020 --> 02:28:39.500]
What's going on?

[02:28:39.740 --> 02:28:40.560]
I'm like that.

[02:28:44.060 --> 02:28:44.460]
God.

[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:48.040]
This is the flu.

[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:49.760]
Okay.

[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:51.160]
Or are cold.

[02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:51.700]
I don't know.

[02:28:52.860 --> 02:28:54.260]
Does it really make a difference what you call it?

[02:28:54.380 --> 02:28:54.620]
It sucks.

[02:28:54.900 --> 02:28:55.640]
Whenever it is, it blows.

[02:28:56.580 --> 02:28:57.340]
Like your nose.

[02:28:58.480 --> 02:28:59.640]
Like a garden hose.

[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:01.400]
Like the water that's pouring out that bitches nose.

[02:29:02.860 --> 02:29:04.500]
On that cozy or whatever the thing was?

[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:05.320]
The nitty-pot.

[02:29:05.460 --> 02:29:06.280]
The nose cozy.

[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:07.560]
Nitty-pot.

[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:10.160]
Nitty-pot.

[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:10.820]
Yeah.

[02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:13.120]
Huh.

[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:15.800]

[02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:19.340]
It's the most pretty ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life.

[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:22.060]
Like something old that they're bringing back now or?

[02:29:22.220 --> 02:29:25.000]
I don't know if it's coming back, but there are people that swear by it.

[02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:26.900]
I swear at it.

[02:29:27.100 --> 02:29:27.220]
Yeah.

[02:29:28.460 --> 02:29:29.840]
I did my eye drops again.

[02:29:30.060 --> 02:29:30.660]
Aren't you proud of me?

[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:33.160]
And I did it just the way you suggested.

[02:29:34.260 --> 02:29:37.200]
I don't know how I went through life before, you know, that chick told me that.

[02:29:39.380 --> 02:29:43.900]
Here's one from the fake Steve Rodden Arrow, which I already had blocked him.

[02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:46.820]
But I went through the blocked ones, you know, I figured, well, we got a few minutes to kill here.

[02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:47.160]
Why not?

[02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:48.060]
Right?

[02:29:48.700 --> 02:29:48.840]
Right.

[02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:50.480]
Seven, but who's counting?

[02:29:52.140 --> 02:29:53.340]
Neil, good morning, sir.

[02:29:54.440 --> 02:29:57.260]
I just wanted to let you know that you missed a compelling time at the reunion picnic.

[02:29:57.540 --> 02:29:59.360]
Who was the one I used to write about compelling radio?

[02:29:59.380 --> 02:30:00.280]
Oh, that was Mr. Radio.

[02:30:00.700 --> 02:30:00.900]
Right.

[02:30:02.780 --> 02:30:09.980]
And it certainly could be that Mr. Radio is the same as Steve Rodden Arrow, because nobody in their right mind remembers Steve Rodden Arrow from South Florida TV.

[02:30:09.980 --> 02:30:13.920]
Nobody other than a chronic pathetic groupie like Mr. Radio.

[02:30:15.420 --> 02:30:17.660]
The softball game was the biggest hit of the day.

[02:30:17.800 --> 02:30:19.820]
Brian Norcross was voted MVP of the game.

[02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:23.860]
Sally Fitzliped on second base and landed right on her...

[02:30:23.860 --> 02:30:24.220]
Brackdom!

[02:30:25.220 --> 02:30:28.040]
Camberrill Martian and Bob Soepred did a magnificent job on the grill.

[02:30:29.220 --> 02:30:31.740]
We had a surprise visit from herman and McBean.

[02:30:32.020 --> 02:30:33.520]
Boy, I forgot how funny those two were.

[02:30:34.900 --> 02:30:36.360]
Too bad you missed such a good time.

[02:30:36.640 --> 02:30:37.760]
We're planning to get in for next year.

[02:30:37.760 --> 02:30:38.760]
Hopefully you could come.

[02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:39.200]
No.

[02:30:40.240 --> 02:30:42.540]
Drop me a line if you ever come down North Carolina Mountains.

[02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:43.200]
George too.

[02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:49.400]
Looking forward to some real compelling NHL Stanley Cup playoffs tonight, regards the fake Steve Rodden Arrow.

[02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:51.540]
Compelling.

[02:30:53.160 --> 02:30:55.240]
Who was it that wrote about compelling radio?

[02:30:55.600 --> 02:30:56.080]
Mr. Radio.

[02:30:57.480 --> 02:30:57.740]
Right.

[02:30:57.920 --> 02:30:58.240]
That's him.

[02:30:58.420 --> 02:30:59.920]
This is a signal from Mr. Radio.

[02:31:01.300 --> 02:31:05.140]
Like Rimmer was giving me a signal that he wanted Diffo's job.

[02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:05.860]
Give me a signal.

[02:31:06.860 --> 02:31:08.340]
I mean, is that stupid or what?

[02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:09.560]
Yeah.

[02:31:11.720 --> 02:31:13.620]
Same to me like you were giving a signal to me.

[02:31:13.740 --> 02:31:14.900]
You know that, yeah, given a signal.

[02:31:15.180 --> 02:31:17.560]
I mean, you know, this is somebody I used to talk to all the time.

[02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:18.520]
Who used to be a friend of mine.

[02:31:18.660 --> 02:31:18.960]
Used to be.

[02:31:20.140 --> 02:31:21.440]
You know me, I chase him all the way.

[02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:24.660]
In his case, oh, hallelujah, oh, happy day.

[02:31:26.780 --> 02:31:27.980]
I don't know what it is about him.

[02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:28.720]
I love his wife.

[02:31:28.820 --> 02:31:30.900]
She's a real sweetheart, but him annoying.

[02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:37.420]
Dan, you're pulling me out of business both financially and job wise.

[02:31:40.440 --> 02:31:40.760]
Yeah.

[02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:41.120]
You're a man.

[02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:42.260]
I know.

[02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:43.540]
Like, pal, we're going to go to dinner.

[02:31:43.540 --> 02:31:44.380]
We're going to go with him.

[02:31:44.500 --> 02:31:45.420]
A lot of work together with him.

[02:31:45.700 --> 02:31:45.960]
Uh-huh.

[02:31:46.600 --> 02:31:47.580]
Booking him hockey shows.

[02:31:47.820 --> 02:31:49.220]
Oh, we got to do a hockey show.

[02:31:52.900 --> 02:31:54.480]
The ramblings of a madman.

[02:31:54.760 --> 02:31:55.520]
That's all I can say.

[02:31:56.140 --> 02:31:57.140]
Only I was the crazy one.

[02:31:57.240 --> 02:31:58.040]
Let him talk me into it.

[02:31:59.840 --> 02:32:02.920]
I'm really not sure why you're old, softy.

[02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:03.240]
That's what.

[02:32:04.100 --> 02:32:04.760]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:32:04.860 --> 02:32:05.580]
I can't say no.

[02:32:06.640 --> 02:32:08.100]
That was up 63 points.

[02:32:10.460 --> 02:32:12.420]
I'll tell you what else I took some last night too.

[02:32:12.500 --> 02:32:12.980]
That awful.

[02:32:13.100 --> 02:32:13.520]
What's it called?

[02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:15.080]
That cough medicine?

[02:32:16.040 --> 02:32:17.060]
Uh, robotusin?

[02:32:17.320 --> 02:32:18.160]
No, no, no, no.

[02:32:18.300 --> 02:32:19.240]
It's a Canadian thing.

[02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:20.620]
Oh, I told you about it before.

[02:32:21.540 --> 02:32:22.240]
Taste like battery.

[02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:24.480]
Taste like the stuff I'm supposed to put in my eye.

[02:32:24.480 --> 02:32:25.220]
Pose or brand?

[02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:27.920]
Oh, it is just absolutely.

[02:32:28.120 --> 02:32:29.560]
Let me, you want me to go and look at it again?

[02:32:30.540 --> 02:32:31.000]
Yeah, sure.

[02:32:31.320 --> 02:32:33.820]
Take about 10 seconds and then I might just keep going to go out the door.

[02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:37.800]
It is just vile.

[02:32:38.380 --> 02:32:39.060]
One moment please.

[02:32:39.460 --> 02:32:39.760]
Okay.

[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:40.700]
Oh.

[02:33:03.060 --> 02:33:03.340]
Okay.

[02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:06.140]
Where does association, here's the way to remember it in the future, William F.

[02:33:06.580 --> 02:33:07.080]
Oh, luckily.

[02:33:09.620 --> 02:33:12.540]
It tastes just good and then they're advertising.

[02:33:12.540 --> 02:33:14.800]
They say taste horrendous and it works great.

[02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:19.660]
It's like cough and cold and throat medicine and like that and just, oh.

[02:33:21.140 --> 02:33:24.260]
I don't know what battery acid tastes like but it can't be any worse than that.

[02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:25.960]
Just horrible.

[02:33:27.820 --> 02:33:31.580]
In fact, I think the as part of acid comes to play there somewhere.

[02:33:32.040 --> 02:33:32.420]
Correct them.

[02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:35.440]
Oh, so I took some of that and see how good it did.

[02:33:36.300 --> 02:33:36.880]
Did it?

[02:33:37.180 --> 02:33:38.900]
These things run their course, you know what I mean?

[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:39.600]
They run their course.

[02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:43.220]
You can take your echinacea and your vitamins C and all these pills.

[02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:44.440]
You can pop all bunch of pills.

[02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:44.840]
Right.

[02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:46.500]
You're just addressing the symptoms at best.

[02:33:47.700 --> 02:33:48.620]
You're addressing it?

[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:51.240]
Self-addressed, regressing it.

[02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:55.640]
410 votes on the pool and the winner is so far American Idol.

[02:33:56.740 --> 02:33:57.140]
95.

[02:33:57.960 --> 02:33:59.900]
The Jonas Brothers still respectable, turd.

[02:34:01.420 --> 02:34:04.160]
And what does it say where, what kind of rings around their things?

[02:34:05.020 --> 02:34:05.580]
Chastity rings.

[02:34:05.660 --> 02:34:06.300]
Oh, promise rings.

[02:34:06.300 --> 02:34:07.320]
They're promise rings.

[02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:08.240]
They're called promise rings.

[02:34:08.360 --> 02:34:09.720]
I promise I won't do it.

[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:12.600]
Yeah, with a girl.

[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:14.880]
In their case.

[02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:16.560]
Now, why do you say that?

[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:19.400]
Why is it that everybody you find offensive is gay?

[02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:21.160]
Oh, no, I don't.

[02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:22.280]
That's not the rule at all.

[02:34:22.280 --> 02:34:22.820]
Oh, God.

[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:24.460]
They have to look and act really gay.

[02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:26.480]
Here's the rule I use.

[02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:27.980]
If you're not interested in having sex with girls.

[02:34:30.380 --> 02:34:33.000]
How do you know the Jonas Brothers aren't interested in having sex with anyone?

[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:34.420]
Because they wear those gay rings.

[02:34:35.060 --> 02:34:35.880]
So what does that prove?

[02:34:36.260 --> 02:34:36.760]
That they're gay.

[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:37.720]
No.

[02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:39.100]
It's an act.

[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:40.060]
Oh, I know.

[02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:40.580]
I know that.

[02:34:41.660 --> 02:34:42.420]
It's all a big act.

[02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:43.600]
They're probably doing it with each other.

[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:45.900]
Oh, that doesn't make them gay.

[02:34:47.140 --> 02:34:47.700]
Oh, no.

[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:49.160]
Just make some brotherly.

[02:34:49.260 --> 02:34:49.560]
That's all.

[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:50.840]
That's brotherly love.

[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:52.360]
Makes for a really tight family.

[02:34:52.500 --> 02:34:53.720]
Yeah, the tightest love of all.

[02:34:56.260 --> 02:34:56.620]
Really?

[02:34:57.060 --> 02:34:57.820]
Therefore, we didn't love.

[02:34:58.240 --> 02:34:59.660]
The bonus, I mean, Jonas Brothers.

[02:34:59.660 --> 02:35:01.180]
They love that they're not speak its name.

[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:03.760]
Well, we did.

[02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:05.340]
I think we did all the emails today.

[02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:06.420]
Let's see about the eleded.

[02:35:06.900 --> 02:35:07.180]
No.

[02:35:07.860 --> 02:35:09.240]
I think I even covered those.

[02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:10.760]
Oh, Dave Friedman from an old friend.

[02:35:11.540 --> 02:35:13.300]
Is that is that pathetic or what?

[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:14.640]
Yes.

[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:17.400]
But then again, he's pathetic.

[02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:19.260]
And so is his fat friend, Jeff High.

[02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:19.520]
Yep.

[02:35:20.860 --> 02:35:22.900]
Pathetic, tragic, and old friend.

[02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:24.120]
Well, I don't listen anymore.

[02:35:24.200 --> 02:35:26.220]
But George is this and you're that and blah, blah, blah, blah.

[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:27.320]
Yeah, he's talking to me.

[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:27.320]

[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:28.340]
He's talking to me.

[02:35:28.340 --> 02:35:28.520]
I'm not feeling.

[02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:30.960]
Go away and die.

[02:35:31.180 --> 02:35:32.160]
Not necessarily in that order.

[02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:36.240]
Well, guess what?

[02:35:36.380 --> 02:35:38.780]
I finished my caffeine-free diet coke.

[02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:41.680]
I didn't have any Pepsi as to the Pist me off.

[02:35:43.460 --> 02:35:45.240]
Well, actually, this isn't even diet coke.

[02:35:45.460 --> 02:35:47.180]
It's a zero.

[02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:48.220]
What would they call it?

[02:35:49.460 --> 02:35:50.060]
Pepsi zero?

[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:51.920]
No, that's not what it's called.

[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:52.820]
What do you got?

[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:53.280]
Pepsi Max?

[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:55.000]
No. Pepsi, not.

[02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:56.160]
Well, whatever the hell it is.

[02:35:56.540 --> 02:35:57.260]
Have a great time.

[02:35:57.260 --> 02:36:03.840]
Cool NiiHow

[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:08.840]
I'm gonna make a man here, you're mine

[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:13.520]
I'm fighting for the WQA

[02:36:18.780 --> 02:36:20.180]
Very fast

[02:36:24.580 --> 02:36:28.340]
Now everybody's all they gather around and listen if you was

[02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:31.840]
When I tell you every person needs a way of feeling good

[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:35.300]
Every kid needs a ball of spring and as they dog a stick

[02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:38.820]
But all you need is a bag of weed you really get a dick

[02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:42.880]
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:46.300]
A bag of weed, a bag of weed or everything is better with a bag of weed

[02:36:46.300 --> 02:36:49.840]
If you only hope to ever meet because everything is better with a bag of weed

[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:52.460]
Here, go, you're all giddin' now

[02:36:53.140 --> 02:36:55.120]
When tissue's people wide and wet

[02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:56.560]
They go assault a queer

[02:36:56.560 --> 02:36:58.600]
When students meet one need a friend

[02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:00.140]
They wrench the rocket here

[02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:02.100]
When Michael Jackson needs a rash

[02:37:02.100 --> 02:37:03.520]
He hopes a guy like me

[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:06.660]
Right, but all we need is a bag of weed to keep us worried

[02:37:06.660 --> 02:37:10.280]
Three, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:12.780]
A bag of weed, a bag of weed or everything is better with a bag of weed

[02:37:12.780 --> 02:37:16.280]
If you only hope to ever meet because everything is better with a bag of weed

[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:18.340]
I'll get a ride

[02:37:19.540 --> 02:37:22.880]
As Mr. HL Minkin said, the common man's a fool

[02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:26.520]
And just like Helen Keller said, do you give people food?

[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:29.920]
But try and use your heads and don't buy into all the beer

[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:33.420]
I don't only need you as a bag of weed to make us want a cheer

[02:37:33.420 --> 02:37:34.640]
I don't want to

[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:38.200]
A bag of weed or bag of weed or everything is better with a bag of weed

[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:39.880]
If you try and fight for the rollercoats

[02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:41.840]
Because everything is better with a bag of weed

[02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:49.320]
Here's the gildin' I'm beer

[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:55.860]
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

[02:37:58.980 --> 02:38:12.260]
A bag of weed or everything is better with a bag of weed or everything is better with a bag of weed

[02:38:12.940 --> 02:38:16.740]
I'm just playing it off of YouTube, I didn't have time to find a clean copy of it as if

[02:38:16.740 --> 02:38:23.240]
Sure, I got to get the the T-bow thing going or I could just use my arcos for how the way it's designed instead of a glorified hard drive

[02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:29.060]
I could actually record TV shows and bring it in here and do my own production instead of trusting these people

[02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:31.900]
Posting stuff on YouTube, but it's only there for five minutes anyway

[02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:36.400]
Enjoy it while it's there, right? Baguette just brought a type in family guy, bag of weed song, and you'll get the other visuals

[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:38.020]
They rip it right out of there

[02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:38.780]
It was here yesterday

[02:38:39.420 --> 02:38:42.160]
And just the song is there today, but it's just got still pictures

[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:43.400]
Good luck to you

[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:46.160]
And if it disappears from there, it'll be somewhere

[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:47.760]
Somebody will post it, e-bomb

[02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:48.940]
What's the point of them pulling it off?

[02:38:48.940 --> 02:38:49.660]
It's a e-bomb world

[02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:52.660]
It's promotion, yeah, let's go

[02:38:52.660 --> 02:38:57.000]
You know how it is, you know how it is in this business, people they don't know what's good for them

[02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:01.240]
Well, I wonder if it was the family guy people or the Fox people that believe the Fox people

[02:39:01.240 --> 02:39:01.860]
Yeah, I would guess

[02:39:01.860 --> 02:39:05.340]
You know, NBC was the one that started that whole thing in the first place

[02:39:05.340 --> 02:39:08.340]
Yeah, started really going spazzy about that

[02:39:08.340 --> 02:39:11.640]
And then they make the product available on their site

[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:12.160]
Of course

[02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:14.720]
Also for free, but then they get the ad revenue from it

[02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:16.140]
That's fine, we don't care

[02:39:16.140 --> 02:39:18.260]
I tell people

[02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:21.440]
You know, it's all out there on the internet

[02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:24.680]
If your computer can see it, if it's a digital thing, whatever it is

[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:28.060]
Music, a picture, a movie, video, whatever it is

[02:39:28.060 --> 02:39:31.240]
If it's something that your computer can see and play, it's free

[02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:33.240]
Yeah, if you want it to be

[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:35.420]
If you know the right keystrokes

[02:39:35.420 --> 02:39:36.760]
I just

[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:38.980]
I pity people

[02:39:38.980 --> 02:39:41.700]
And I'm still buying stuff just so you know

[02:39:41.700 --> 02:39:47.800]
I'm still buying something if it's good enough a DVD, a CD or something and adding it to the collection if I feel it's collection worthy

[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:53.980]
Sometimes just to have the pretty box on the shelf because then boxes they sure can be pretty sometimes

[02:39:55.220 --> 02:39:59.340]
But it's a great way to save your time like for example that Wolverine thing

[02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:06.180]
Yeah, just not the first time that I've saved some money by previewing

[02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:06.900]
That's what I call it

[02:40:06.900 --> 02:40:10.600]
I preview, I screen it, you know they call it the screener when you get it

[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:14.760]
It says right on the bottom, you know DVD screener only for you know you're not supposed to have this

[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:16.320]
You're seeing this, you're bad

[02:40:16.900 --> 02:40:17.700]
The evil person

[02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:23.800]
And so I screen it like the first Hulk movie which was awful

[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:26.900]
Didn't even look at the second Hulk movie which was only mediocre

[02:40:26.900 --> 02:40:29.900]
I almost want to see that

[02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:38.240]
I would have been like riot level angry like Terran seats up and throwing them at the screen angry

[02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:41.480]
If I had paid money to go see that piece of turd

[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:49.600]
Yeah, the second one was bad enough and the Wolverine thing and you know whatever it's got some visuals in it but they fall way short

[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:52.840]
It was weak so I'm really glad that I got to see that

[02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:56.840]
Like to me the original Hulk that couldn't even look good with the trailer which is hard to do

[02:40:56.840 --> 02:40:59.460]
Right because usually the trailer looks great even if the movie sucks

[02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:04.600]
They keep forgetting we don't want to go on about this they keep forgetting hey how about a plot how about story line what they forget that

[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:14.640]
That's why you know the comics that do go on to become popular or books or comic books whatever the literary medium that these movies are often based on

[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:16.620]
A lot of most of the time it's it's a book

[02:41:16.620 --> 02:41:23.500]
They take just bits and pieces the wrong bits and pieces from the book or comic book and then bring that over on to the screen

[02:41:23.500 --> 02:41:28.140]
And just absolutely abandoned the reason that the book or comic book was popular in the first place

[02:41:28.140 --> 02:41:30.720]
And that it was a really good story where I didn't know what was gonna happen

[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:34.300]
It's like in a was on the edge of my seat like oh suspense and all those elements

[02:41:34.300 --> 02:41:42.200]
Yeah, right and it's an explosion's in there and sure as long as the costume and it look it's got the costume and the name and it's fine

[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:44.200]
Like that last Superman movie which was just awful

[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:48.920]
I they're no excuse far from that being made the first one was okay the first one was fine

[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:53.380]
There's no excuse for doing it again later on and doing it worse than you did the first time yeah

[02:41:53.380 --> 02:41:57.940]
I love a god. That's one of the ones I actually turned off halfway through. So how you doing there Lee I'm good

[02:41:57.940 --> 02:42:00.440]

[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:04.640]
You're taking the day off tomorrow because it's your birthday. That's it gives me one more day to shop for your present

[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:08.660]
See see I was gonna go to this afternoon, but I'll I'll put it off now

[02:42:08.660 --> 02:42:11.860]
If I had a known that Neil was taken off I would have requested a different day off

[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:15.140]
Sure, we just get the day to use what we want well we can't plan these things out

[02:42:15.140 --> 02:42:19.280]
This is all part of like it's not just live radio, but you know

[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:25.380]
Unscripted the show when everything is unscripted, but our lives are when you do this for a living your entire day is unscripted

[02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:27.300]
You don't know from one day that the next what's going on

[02:42:27.300 --> 02:42:31.700]
Well, I thought it was really funny today that someone recommended putting the lemon juice in your eye to cure pink guy

[02:42:31.700 --> 02:42:31.920]
Yeah

[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.860]
Oh, oh the stuff they send in it's only

[02:42:35.860 --> 02:42:40.200]
I was like this is like because you don't know who's on the other end of any of these emails or phone calls or anything

[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:46.900]
But the the notion it's like if you did know you would definitely not even take the call or read the email

[02:42:46.900 --> 02:42:52.120]
But it's like it's like some crazy you know you you pass by the crazies on this street yelling at the person that isn't there

[02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:54.360]
Yeah shouting at the invisible man or something like that

[02:42:54.360 --> 02:43:01.160]
It's like taking medical advice from that guy medical or fashion advice or maybe some investment advice from that guy from the homeless guy

[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:03.780]
Well now there's a four Myers was a crazy guy that did that but on the corner

[02:43:03.780 --> 02:43:08.660]
He also held a the receiver part of the phone the ear part of the phone that was connected to nothing perfect

[02:43:09.220 --> 02:43:12.260]
Dude that's that's like a prop comic that's a prop crazy

[02:43:12.260 --> 02:43:15.380]
Yeah, I would have given that guy money at least he's putting on an effort

[02:43:15.380 --> 02:43:21.060]
It's just like like the beggars that actually do something right you know if you're gonna if you're gonna beg for the love of God

[02:43:21.060 --> 02:43:24.480]
