[00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.880]
The music expressed on the music.

[00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.360]
Get your nose on it. Everybody else is crushed.

[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.240]
Oh my god.

[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.280]
That's the music on the script.

[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.040]
It's fast, avatars, great.

[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.920]
How you doing ladies?

[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.720]
5, 6, 7, W, Q, A, M, Miami.

[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.500]
Good boy, you're welcome.

[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.520]
I'm the one.

[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.240]
5, 6, E, W, Q, A, M, Presents.

[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.760]
The Neil Roger Show.

[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.460]
To talk to Neil, dial 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and date and broard.

[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.060]
In other counties, call toll free, 877785, Neil.

[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.540]
Or pound 560 on your AT&T and Verizon wireless phones.

[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.020]
The opinions expressed by Neil, his guests or his colleagues

[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.380]
do not represent those of WQAM management staff or sponsors.

[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.980]
No.

[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.300]
The Neil Roger Show.

[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.780]
On 560 WQAM.

[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.720]
Neil, Gah.

[00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.820]
Baseball fans everywhere.

[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.200]
I'm not here to say that I'm sorry.

[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.180]
I'll be honest with you.

[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.780]
Today I have plans to do steroids.

[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.900]
Now the next step is to address the media about what I took

[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.460]
and where it came from.

[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.540]
Alex, you talked about the performance enhancing drugs.

[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.380]
You discontinued the use wrong. Why?

[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.900]
I didn't stop.

[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.420]
I came going back to steroids.

[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.420]
I just ejected.

[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.100]
Before I walked here today, some people may refer to this as cheating.

[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.280]
How do you address parents now?

[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.480]
How to talk to their kids?

[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.920]
About the fact that you profited from this.

[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.960]
First thing I said, a parent just sit on it.

[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.180]
If I had a son, I would definitely recommend steroid abuse.

[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.640]
I thank you for being here.

[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.420]
Thank you.

[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.640]
Sit on this.

[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.540]
10 o'clock at 560 WQAM.

[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.940]
Happy Wednesday to you, boy.

[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.700]
This week is just zooming by.

[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.780]
So far.

[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.820]
No, it's not.

[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.460]
It's fine.

[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.720]
We got some interesting emails today.

[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.860]
Not great, but interesting.

[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.840]
Interesting.

[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.280]
Some real crap.

[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.380]
Here's one from the fake Tom Jicca.

[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.680]
I heard you read the email from jazz McCay yesterday.

[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.160]
I don't believe he was the first guest to host you ever had Philen for you with WIOD.

[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.220]
Wait, wait till you hear this.

[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.740]
Okay.

[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.960]
Beside the bird, didn't you have Alan Burke, Tony Sigmato, and Rick Sanchez Philen for you during various times?

[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.780]
The answer to all of the above is no.

[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.440]

[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.380]
Alan Burke didn't work on WIOD.

[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.700]
Tony Sigmato and Rick Sanchez, no chance.

[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.020]
No.

[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.620]
Was this Gary Bruce's idea?

[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.060]
No.

[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.460]
Wasn't anybody's idea because it didn't happen, fake Tommy.

[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.900]
Wouldn't you like to take some piano wire?

[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.780]
Yeah.

[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.500]
And put it around the neck to some of these fake, phony, lifeless, A-holes, who send crap,

[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.720]
I usually think fire, gasoline and fire.

[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.180]
No.

[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.620]
Yeah.

[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.460]
Piano wire.

[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.520]
I want to see them inflame.

[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.140]
Plements are sitting in the back seat.

[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.520]
Oh, yeah.

[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.400]
With the garret.

[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.320]
Yeah.

[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.260]
I forgot the garret.

[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.660]

[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.980]
Rooster Chuchu is back again.

[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.960]
Of course, how could anybody doubt the validity and the severity of similar to the name like Rooster Chuchu?

[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.280]
Subject, your response.

[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.540]
This is nearly as outstanding as the one the other day.

[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.560]
This is a pretty weak.

[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.760]
Well, he's at the bar pretty high.

[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.340]
He's at it.

[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.340]

[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.600]
It.

[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.440]
Your response to my email was predictable.

[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.940]
I know my voice and message might get drowned out by all the other people who rightly but ineffectively try to influence your show content.

[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.100]
By the way, on my own person, nobody's behind this email but myself.

[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.340]
I've never contacted you show before yesterday.

[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.980]
They ride.

[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.660]
I'll give you an example of how you've changed before you would talk about your homosexual celebrity crushes like Luis Miguel.

[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.820]
But it didn't pervade the show like it does now.

[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.700]
I mean, before there was just one man who you talk about.

[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.620]
Now the volume is just too much.

[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.780]
You talk about so many different men now.

[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.500]
It's really hard to deal with that all morning.

[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.100]
Well, how about afternoon?

[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.880]
How about if I just talk about men for noon to two as opposed to all morning?

[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.900]
Tell George to shut his mouth about my email.

[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.320]
Uh-huh.

[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.700]
I wrote Neil, didn't I?

[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.920]
Not midget George.

[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.680]
Bravo.

[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.520]
He's little short ass was a skater in a runner when he was in elementary school.

[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.740]
That's really impressive.

[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.520]
He has such an overinflated view of himself that makes me want to staple his mouth shut once and for all.

[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.880]
He's such a man's man.

[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.720]
How come his wife has had his balls in her pocket for 20 years?

[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.040]
Show up.

[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.540]
That ass.

[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.520]
Nobody cares about your life, George.

[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.320]
Show up.

[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.060]
That ass.

[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.260]
Rooster to chew.

[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.980]
How come your wife has had your balls in your pocket for 20 years?

[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.100]
Rooster wants to know.

[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.420]
Yeah.

[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.240]
And that's it.

[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.300]
That's all he's uh...

[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.660]
He leaves his life with fat shut in the way he put wet.

[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.320]
Pano wire.

[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.980]
Pano wire around the jaws of life and a macchina.

[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.820]
Rooster chewing it.

[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.840]

[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.800]
Oh my god.

[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.100]
What kind of a subhuman piece of turd comes up with a phony name like that?

[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.740]
Brailer dwelling, mommy living.

[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.580]
Yeah.

[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.920]
Here's the pull result for me.

[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.880]
I said it was an embarrassingly bad pull.

[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.100]
Not that today's is also great, but...

[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.560]
What do you most admire about Abe Lincoln?

[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.680]
And guess what won?

[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.020]
WTF, I told you.

[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.600]
Didn't I tell you?

[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:05.100]
Yep.

[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.800]
770 votes and WTF had 143.

[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.800]
Who cares about frickin' Abe Lincoln?

[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.960]
Great speech by Obama last night, by the way.

[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.520]
Great speech.

[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.460]
Not good, but great.

[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.560]
And I didn't watch Bobby Jindal because I'm not a masochist.

[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.860]
All these people have an opinion about Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal.

[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:22.560]
He's an idiot.

[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.120]
He's a simpleton.

[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.540]
Somebody forgot to tell Bobby that the right wing uh...

[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.740]
It's all over.

[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.660]
It's over.

[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.400]
Like this radio station, it's over, but we keep collecting paychecks.

[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.220]
So my check is going to show up today, I hope.

[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.040]
That's what I was told.

[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.040]
Hi, whom?

[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.800]
Jenny.

[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.640]
Oh, I thought you were having clearance to take care of it.

[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.760]
He was busy on the air.

[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.700]
Told you.

[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.720]
What do you mean he was on the air doing what?

[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.000]
I don't know what any of these people do.

[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.340]
Oh my god.

[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.000]
Now we got clearance on the air.

[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.140]
Oh, we are doomed.

[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.460]
DOOMED.

[00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.260]
DOOMED to die.

[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.380]
WTF 143.

[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.000]
He freed the slaves, Abel and Cohen, 117.

[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.900]
He led the nation to the Civil War 89.

[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.300]
There's so many choices on here.

[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.500]
It's not bad enough that it's a bad poll, but a bad poll just loaded, overloaded with

[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.960]
a Zidian stupid-ass choices, Charlie B.

[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.280]
He saved the Union 84.

[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.780]
He was a great president, 81.

[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.460]
He succeeded despite limited schooling, 43.

[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.580]
He might have been gay.

[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.160]
Gay, 33.

[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.080]
Gay Abe.

[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.780]
He wore a spiffy stove top hat, 30.

[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.020]
His Gettysburg addressed, 27.

[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.080]
He liked to tell stories and crack dirty jokes, 22.

[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.800]
He was pro-labor, 20.

[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.560]
He was honest day of 18.

[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.200]
He was a master, debater, 12.

[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.740]
He gave his name to a fine car, 11.

[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.820]
He looks good on a shiny new penny, 8.

[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.420]
He came from a log cabinet.

[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.780]
He graces the $5 bill, 7.

[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.820]
He improved his looks with a beard, 6.

[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.960]
But a bag would have done a hell of a lot better job.

[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.520]
His memorial in DC6.

[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.440]
His height for it is name one.

[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.920]
His name.

[00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.980]
I admire his name.

[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.620]
Abe Lincoln.

[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.320]
As opposed to Izzy Rabinowitz.

[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.780]
Izzy Rabinowitz.

[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.620]
Is he something that was good?

[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.360]
And we still don't know what off-till office means.

[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.880]
That really pisses me off.

[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.700]
It's a Goya Shavelt baby, all the Goya, all the time.

[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.420]
All those red necks you were talking about in Michigan.

[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.660]
Everybody's starving to death and Detroit,

[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.660]
and they were putting out stupid, right wing propaganda songs.

[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.320]
They just never stop.

[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.880]
Larry says, and this is disturbing,

[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.720]
because just like we've got a fake Facebook page,

[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.740]
we've also got a fake Twitter page, evidently.

[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.560]
OK.

[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.260]
Larry says, just wondering if the neo-Rodger show on Twitter

[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.940]
is real or just a fan profile.

[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.160]
It's just a fake.

[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.480]
While we don't agree politically,

[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.400]
I've loved your show since I first heard it in Tampa.

[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.020]
Take care, Tampa listener.

[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.340]
Larry, well, thanks, Larry.

[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.140]
It's fake.

[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:55.820]
It's airs out.

[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.140]
It's like most of the people in Tampa, fake, fake humans,

[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.800]
real subhumans, fake humans, fake.

[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.280]
And by the way, for the fake Alice Rantel

[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.740]
and also for a takeer park, whatever her name is,

[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.860]
a nobody in South Florida cares about the radio in Los Angeles.

[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.980]
We don't care about anything in LA.

[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.340]
The first of all, there's almost no LA people in South Florida,

[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.520]
number one, and number two, even if there were,

[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.880]
I mean, how many are there?

[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.340]
You know what I mean?

[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.560]
I'm not sure about the state of LA radio.

[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.000]
Not really.

[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.320]
Here's a long, the Oducinozole Chris,

[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.180]
with a whole song to dance, something about your boyfriend

[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:40.900]
at Woodbine.

[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.120]
OK, I'll read it.

[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.520]
I'm trying to see if there's anything redeeming about it.

[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.260]
Yeah, I did watch the speech last night.

[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.860]
It was assimilating and spectacular.

[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.800]
And I loved it.

[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.760]
And the Congress loved it too.

[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.180]
Even the Republicans couldn't resist

[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.800]
getting up and giving a lot of standing and sitting

[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.240]
ovation.

[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.400]
Even old John McCain.

[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.100]
And the only thing that disturbed me was after the speech,

[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.020]
the he, you know, Obama went through the whole thing

[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.640]
in the shirk hands and kissy kissy.

[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.420]
And then he got a big hug from Jew Lieberman.

[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.960]
Oh, I wanted to vomit all my food from yesterday.

[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.120]
Oh, Jew Lieberman.

[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.760]
The fake Tom jikers on here.

[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.180]
You are wrong.

[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.520]
I was listening with my own ears.

[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.960]
Did they ever exchange his fill in for you?

[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.140]
He was working across the hall at WSVN.

[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.440]
WSVN wasn't across the hall.

[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:35.120]
OK.

[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.260]
It wasn't in the same building.

[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.440]
It was in a separate building right next door,

[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.620]
but not across the hall.

[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.440]
You think Tom jikker would say WSVN was across the hall?

[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.100]
No.

[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.940]
I have no life.

[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.620]
I have no life.

[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.220]
I have no life.

[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.640]
That's the South Florida motto.

[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.340]
I have no life.

[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.380]
And all over from coast to coast,

[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.000]
I have no life.

[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.620]
All the ships at sea.

[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.260]
I have no life.

[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.800]
The lifeless masses.

[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.820]
Oh, let me grab that one first.

[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:04.500]
Correct.

[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.380]
The fake Tom jikker.

[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.660]
You are wrong.

[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.980]
You know, I was listening, spelled wrong.

[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.960]
With my own ears that they were exchange his fill in for you.

[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.160]
He was working across the hall at WSVN.

[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.080]
Don't remember exactly when, but had to be around 1990.

[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.080]

[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.080]

[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.080]

[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.080]

[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.040]
I will contact Rick and CNN to see if he remembers.

[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.000]
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.600]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.560]
I'll contact Rick to see if he remembers.

[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.060]
I could have sworn Alan Burke and Tony Sigredo filled in as well.

[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.100]
Roger may be able to verify this.

[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:34.820]
Roger.

[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.360]
Roger Fagoland, is that who he's talking about?

[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.160]
I guess.

[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.920]
Alan Burke was not on WIOD.

[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.240]
He never would have filled in for me because we were competitors.

[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.940]
He didn't do my show ever, ever, ever, ever.

[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.220]
Maybe I ought to check with him too.

[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.400]
I know he's still dead, but we'll all get a sales going.

[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.680]
Yeah, let's get a sales going with Alan Burke.

[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.520]
That's Mr. Burke to you, dummy.

[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.540]
Like I said, he turned out to be a good guy, and he died.

[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.420]
That's unfortunate.

[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.000]
There's so many other people on the ear who have been on the ear over the years,

[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.640]
and there's still a life who should be dead.

[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.840]
Like the fake Tom Jicke, for example.

[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.120]
Dution Island Chris, as I'm sure you watched Obama's speech last night,

[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.580]
not Godfather on AMC for the 500th time, that's correct.

[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.900]
Did you see Senator John Boner?

[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.800]
I want to smack that goofy bitch across the smug blank, blanking mouth.

[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.640]
And there was Bobby Jindel's GOP response,

[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.500]
what a steaming pile of poo that was.

[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.580]
That dude actually thinks he's got a chance in 2012.

[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.760]
I realize that you're in love with one of his people,

[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.520]
your boyfriend at Woodbind, but please, there's like 400 Indians living in this country,

[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.000]
most of whom work in convenience stores, and are the most impatient and rude people ever.

[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.420]
Don't be picking on my boyfriend at Woodbind.

[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.040]
And then what's his name?

[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:48.780]
He's going to get all upset.

[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.920]
The rooster cogburn there.

[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.600]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.060]
Oh, he's talking about his boyfriend again.

[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.360]
It's just too much all morning.

[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.040]
That's all he talks about is hot guys.

[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.180]
Man, little bit of that.

[00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:58.460]
Yeah.

[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.500]
Yeah, I was the one that made up the thing about Jeffrey Donovan,

[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.720]
which I never heard of the show and never heard of the person before.

[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.580]
I was the one that made that up.

[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.300]
Good luck getting votes even though no one except your own people can stand

[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.200]
being in your presence for long and that takes to buy a pack of smokes in a beef jerky,

[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.320]
meaning Bobby Jindel.

[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.700]
I realize that's racist, but I don't care.

[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.500]
He's a Republican.

[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:17.740]
Thanks.

[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.540]
Even though this might be blocked after you told me to go away after my last email,

[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.440]
Dushnazel Chris.

[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.420]
Yeah, go away.

[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.500]
Bigoted Bastard.

[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.360]
We're not going to vote against Bobby Jindel because he's an Indian,

[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.480]
because he's an idiot.

[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:30.720]
He's the right-wing extremist.

[00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.810]
A jackass has simple to it.

[00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.970]
And he, you know, he's condemning all those bailouts to the states,

[00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.610]
but he's taken 99% of the money.

[00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.310]
That's interesting for Louisiana because it'd be political suicide to say,

[00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.450]
oh, I'm not taking that money.

[00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.930]
All of our people are starving, but I'm not taking that money.

[00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.230]
Should we take a look at today's outstanding award-winning poll?

[00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.110]
I think it was a brand-in job.

[00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:58.650]
Hi.

[00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.870]
No, that's the one for tomorrow's the bread.

[00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.630]
The definitive chick car of all time is, I don't know who that is.

[00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.510]
345 votes.

[00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.710]
Volkswagen Cabriolay 96.

[00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.470]
Mazda Miata 74.

[00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:10.170]
That got my vote.

[00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.990]
Even though Alex Bennett drove a Miata.

[00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.170]
Oh, he was so torpy, man.

[00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:15.250]
Miata.

[00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:16.290]
Television.

[00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:17.350]
Miata.

[00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.230]
Television.

[00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.710]
Remember those, oh, he was horrible.

[00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.130]
Volkswagen Beetle 73, Pontiac Fero 26.

[00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:27.610]
Mitsubishi Eclipse 18.

[00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.530]
Volkswagen Jetta 15.

[00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:30.930]
Toyota Prius 11.

[00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.050]
Vodz Neon 10.

[00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:33.810]
Honda Prelude 5.

[00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.630]
Audi TT 4.

[00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:36.730]
Can we say TT?

[00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:37.610]
I don't think so.

[00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:39.690]
Ford Escort 4.

[00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.810]
Jeep Liberty 3.

[00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.570]
Honda 200S 3.

[00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.430]
Isuzu impulse to a Toyota MR2.

[00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:46.810]
Solomon Tadeaus.

[00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.790]
Oh, you.

[00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.710]
Yes, I give you the real thing here now.

[00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.730]
After years of drug abuse and controversial rehabilitation,

[00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:59.070]
Beachboy Brian Wilson is ready to release a collection of his latest compositions.

[00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.130]
Thanks for granting us this interview, Brian.

[00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.030]
Brian, do you have any idea how retarded you sound?

[00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:07.570]
It's not.

[00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.850]
It's not.

[00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:09.810]
Show you what I mean.

[00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:14.170]
Here's how you sounded back in 62 from this early Beachboy recording session.

[00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:15.870]
Hey, man.

[00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.650]
Did you like it?

[00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:19.270]
No.

[00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:20.230]
You were too.

[00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.870]
Hit you with my ears.

[00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.090]
Man, good.

[00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:25.230]
Wait.

[00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:26.530]

[00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.130]
Did you like it?

[00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:33.670]
That's a very nice phrase.

[00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.070]
It's real.

[00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.230]
Do you like it?

[00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.950]
The Brian Wilson collection of burned out composition.

[00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.030]
Do you like it?

[00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:55.230]
Oh, yeah.

[00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.330]
Master copy of Animal Now on eBay.

[00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:01.310]
Do you like it?

[00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:02.710]
Well, I've got to be going.

[00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.490]
Do you like it?

[00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:08.690]
No.

[00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.430]
1018 at 560, everybody.

[00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.850]
QI am happy Wednesday to you.

[00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.550]
Monashjana Halalahaze.

[00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:14.810]
As they say in China.

[00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:15.350]
All right.

[00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.770]
Tiny month.

[00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:15.770]

[00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.050]
K.P. says, where is your ash add?

[00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.550]
Oh, I forgot today's ash Wednesday.

[00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.070]
Ah, let me go.

[00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.410]
You had your ash on your forehead?

[00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:24.790]
Let me go make some faster.

[00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.090]
You I'll make some ashes and then I'll rub them on my head.

[00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:27.770]
Yeah, but you will.

[00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.510]
As Wednesday gets his name from the practice of placing ashes on the foreheads of the

[00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.170]
faithful as a sign of repentance.

[00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:39.430]
Yeah, my cabbie had ashes on his head because he went to Troich on Sunday.

[00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:40.410]
I thought he was a raghead.

[00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:41.310]
You're cabbie.

[00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.290]
He's Lebanese, Catholic.

[00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:47.530]
Look, he has the beads hanging from his rearview window, Mr.

[00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.370]
The, the, the, the cross and the beads.

[00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:50.970]
How the hell did that happen?

[00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.830]
There's a lot of Catholics in lesbian on.

[00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:57.270]
I'd know it.

[00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.570]
Well, I'm just telling you, see you learn something every day from the old Fag.

[00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.810]
The ashes used their gathered after the palm crosses from the previous years, palm Sunday

[00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:05.350]
are burned.

[00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.530]
Well, whoop, D.D.

[00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:10.510]
It is in the liturgical practice of some surer churches.

[00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.430]
The ashes are mixed with the oil of the catacumins.

[00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:14.770]
What is that?

[00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.290]
One of the sacred oils used to anoint those about to be baptized.

[00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.410]
Though some churches use ordinary oil.

[00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:22.690]
Catacumins.

[00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:23.710]
Wow.

[00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:28.510]
If we can say that, we'll call up to us and see if that bitch will allow us to say catacumins.

[00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:29.290]
Catacumins?

[00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:31.110]
Catacumins, yeah.

[00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.330]
This paste is used by the priest who presides at the service to make the sign of the cross.

[00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:39.710]
First upon his forehead, then upon each of those present who needle before him at the

[00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:40.310]
altar rail.

[00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.970]
And then of course, the altar boys, they get a little smear on the...

[00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:44.350]
Brackum.

[00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:44.650]
Yeah.

[00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:45.910]
Oh.

[00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:51.690]
As he does so, he recites the words, remember, old man, that you are dust and to dust, you

[00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:52.230]
shall return.

[00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.210]
Oy main says KP.

[00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:55.130]
Oy main.

[00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.950]
Oh, also we have got the real definition of this is the third different one for obzulah

[00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:01.230]
us.

[00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.650]
Great.

[00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.530]
I think it might be correct.

[00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.730]
Let me see if I can find it.

[00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:05.290]
Here it is.

[00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:10.230]
Larry says it means just my luck.

[00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:12.310]
Yeah.

[00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.410]
Joe Belly stick in there to be General Manager.

[00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.190]
Obzulah is just my luck.

[00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:19.790]
What a puss.

[00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:21.770]
So anyways, ask Wednesday.

[00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:25.650]
And we say happy ass Wednesday or unhappy or just a nooter.

[00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:26.170]
Sorry.

[00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:27.030]
What you could help you?

[00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.990]
Sorry what?

[00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:28.770]
I don't know.

[00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:30.870]
Boy, you are.

[00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.770]
I think that the rooster codburn is right.

[00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:33.230]
Yeah.

[00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.250]
I'm a lousy Catholic.

[00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.150]
No, he said you were a lousy human being.

[00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.150]
Is that what he said?

[00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:40.970]
I said I don't care what he said.

[00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.710]
I don't care what it said.

[00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:43.110]
He must.

[00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.330]
I'm starting to agree with you, which is dangerous.

[00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:46.770]
Yeah.

[00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:51.710]
With these emails, they're from just absolutely lifeless turdburn.

[00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.570]
They're from the people that you banned from the show years ago.

[00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.550]
Oh, they're from who knows who they're from.

[00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.030]
I know that.

[00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.430]
You know what you're right, meh?

[00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.830]
What?

[00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:01.830]
So where's this young guy?

[00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:02.790]
Stockbroker guy.

[00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.150]
Real jerk who shows up at Woodbine every afternoon.

[00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.530]
I'll tell you, I don't know how his clients are making any money.

[00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.150]
I think he's taking their money to Woodbine.

[00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:11.650]
Let me take your money to Woodbine.

[00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:12.450]
I'll double it for you.

[00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.670]
Yeah.

[00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:16.090]
But anyway, he intellectualizes the machines.

[00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.710]
He sits in all, if he gave 200, it's going to get forward or pretty soon.

[00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.650]
And I'm thinking of my, and I'm not just thinking.

[00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.390]
I keep telling him, why do you say this crap?

[00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.590]
You've been playing these for ages.

[00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:27.730]
Don't you understand?

[00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.510]
It's just a random luck.

[00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.690]
Oh no, it's going to do this.

[00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.530]
Listen to the pattern, there is no pattern.

[00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:34.910]
And he just gets me very aggravated.

[00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.370]
He's an idiot.

[00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:36.830]
Stockbroker figures.

[00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.170]
Speaking of really dumb, here's one from Mary.

[00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.050]
Neal, did you hear any of the president's speech last night?

[00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.870]
What did you?

[00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:49.770]
What?

[00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.850]
Mary, you need a spanking.

[00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:59.790]
What are those things that they use to not like whips or belts, but the riding crop?

[00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:01.970]
I don't like that.

[00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:02.710]
A cricket bat?

[00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.870]
A cricket bat would be really good.

[00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.470]
Smack your ass till it bleeds, Mary.

[00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:10.630]
Did you hear that?

[00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:14.150]
I mean, why even, why even dignified with a response?

[00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.950]
Because it would kill time.

[00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.510]
No, that's why I read it.

[00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.170]
Trying not to be chronic Jason is not, they're not to be confused with the other Jason.

[00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.970]
We have so many Jason's, some of whom are very chronic.

[00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.090]
But this one is not.

[00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.130]
He says, I enjoyed Obama's speech last night.

[00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.450]
The one thing I really like about him is he's not afraid to point at the previous regime's

[00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.830]
mistakes.

[00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.550]
Right.

[00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:37.890]
Multiple times when Obama's given speeches, he had said things like, this mess wasn't

[00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:38.730]
under my watch.

[00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.930]
The same ones who were holding back the progress of new bills trying to be put through are

[00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.370]
the same folks that got his end of this mess.

[00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:48.150]
He also on multiple occasions has taken a SWAT and W's policies, a SWAT.

[00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:52.070]
No other president my fading memory has done this with so much zest.

[00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.610]
Thanks not to be chronic Jason.

[00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:55.110]
Thank you.

[00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.130]
Amen.

[00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.270]
Yeah, watch the president's speech.

[00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:58.950]
I loved it, Mary.

[00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:01.570]
10.09 she writes it.

[00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.410]
And now it's not one of the first things I said when I came on this morning, what a great

[00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:05.670]
speech he gave last night.

[00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:05.950]
Yes.

[00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.890]
Well, maybe that email got delayed somehow.

[00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.230]
Yeah, delay this.

[00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:10.430]
Maybe she knows the archive.

[00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.710]
Delay that whipping and beating and flogging.

[00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:14.170]
Delay it.

[00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.010]
Delay that piano wire around rooster codburn's neck.

[00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.190]
Oh, I'm not anybody else.

[00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:20.170]
Yeah, I'm not anybody else.

[00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.090]
I'm rooster your schmender.

[00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:27.410]
How about making up like a what could possibly be a real name, you know, like John Smith,

[00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.090]
Mary Jones.

[00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.330]
Jim and Boynton says, how about the Jaguar convertible for the pull for years and years.

[00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.910]
It's the only production car that evoked the thought me.

[00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:39.790]
What does that mean?

[00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:41.610]
What's the model for that?

[00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.730]
Aren't there more than one Jaguar convertible?

[00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:45.490]
I don't know.

[00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.030]
I'm not going to start putting every car that was ever made on there.

[00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.390]
Oh, Jimmy Cifalus.

[00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:50.310]
So here we go.

[00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.190]
Jim, you're a shadow of your former self.

[00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:57.770]
You're always very ugly, but you're sure you used to be great at WNW, WNZW, ZTA and

[00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:58.350]
WYOD.

[00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:59.710]
You're a dottering old man.

[00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:03.810]
Now, in Georgia's a hangar on, signed Jim, Jimmy Cifalus.

[00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.450]
Yeah, hang on to this, Jimmy.

[00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.390]
Wouldn't be the first time for what I understand.

[00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:09.090]
You fairy.

[00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.730]
That's what Tony Cicareto whispered in my ear.

[00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.490]
Oh, and there, and Biden's got the ashes on his forehead.

[00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.710]
Are there paychecks still up because of the holy taxes are going to fall?

[00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:22.750]
And how do you like that?

[00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.130]
You've got some hootspa, man.

[00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:28.050]
Joe Biden, he's a sitting there, the vice president, and he's got the ashes on his forehead.

[00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:37.630]
Doesn't that offend you somewhat that your vice president is mixing religion with being

[00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.850]
alive.

[00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.390]
He's got to play that political game.

[00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:40.690]
Oh, Jimmy up right.

[00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.850]
Go get a towel and wipe off his forehead for the price.

[00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:45.150]
It is there to say, but that's what it's all about.

[00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:46.270]
Now, let's see who he's sitting there.

[00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.070]
Is the president there?

[00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.110]
I sure we wouldn't know if he had the ashes on.

[00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.310]
No, he's sitting with some Jews there.

[00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.810]
They don't have no ashes on there for him.

[00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:53.830]
I don't know who these guys are.

[00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:58.530]
Some of the cows eat more energy, they're efficient, and some of the real guns going

[00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:05.590]
also, making sure that we actually begin to fund the red bed, red face paint removal

[00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.990]
for him.

[00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:09.210]
That was good.

[00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.150]
And you know why he was stumbling in front of him there?

[00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:12.670]
He's got ashes on his forehead.

[00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:19.430]
Rick says, did you by chance happen to see ABC last night before or after the press president

[00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.670]
spoke?

[00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:20.350]
No, I did not.

[00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:21.930]
What's up with Charlie Gibson?

[00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:23.410]
Does he have Parkinson's?

[00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:27.370]
His head was bobbing and shaking like Janet Reno on a bad day.

[00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:33.310]
I don't remember hearing that he had Parkinson's, but he's got something going on there.

[00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.070]
Did you or George happen to notice that?

[00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:35.930]
George didn't watch it.

[00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:36.250]
Nope.

[00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:40.550]
He didn't watch any of the president's speech because George is a fascist.

[00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:40.970]
Yep.

[00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.870]
Maybe someone who watches ABC knows what that's all about.

[00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:47.730]
Rick, you know, the things that you people are concerned about, like all these emails

[00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:51.630]
I'm getting now about, oh, well, Sanchez did fill in.

[00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:52.290]
Who cares?

[00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.330]
So that's the bottom line.

[00:22:55.530 --> 00:23:00.170]
So what if everybody who ever was born filled in on the New York Times show his host?

[00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:01.410]
So and.

[00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:02.550]
And.

[00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:02.630]
And.

[00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.070]
Well, here we go again.

[00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:08.150]
You get a lot of things.

[00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.770]
All right.

[00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.070]
The new Rogers on sports hall made.

[00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:13.890]
The WTA.

[00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.110]
This is CNN.

[00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:19.330]
Breaking news.

[00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:23.390]
The last days of the Bush presidency reportedly included a riff with Vice President Dick

[00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.830]
Cheney.

[00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.910]
Cheney reportedly still holds a grudge.

[00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.450]
Mr. Bush, Mr. Cheney, together again.

[00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.030]
This is going to be back here again.

[00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:30.950]
Good to see you guys.

[00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:31.370]
Whatever.

[00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.370]
What's the story about you two still having a problem?

[00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.090]
I admitted that Dick Cheney's not the prettiest face.

[00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.390]
Um, I have differences in opinion.

[00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:40.250]
Hey, guys.

[00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:41.250]
Dick Cheney's.

[00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:42.650]
Man, sh**, you joke.

[00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:44.710]
It was a me.

[00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.370]
Dude, I saw you.

[00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.390]
I, I, I, I'm broken.

[00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.650]
Oh, he's going to be in the hospital, apparently, for a few days.

[00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.050]
Hey, George, how many fingers am I holding up?

[00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:55.870]
Well, I, and I, and I, uh, right, right.

[00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.750]
He's okay.

[00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:57.370]
CNN.

[00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:58.450]
Breaking news.

[00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:02.190]
Speaking of piano wire, they should have had some there for Jew Lieberman.

[00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.110]
That would have made the night perfect last night.

[00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:05.370]
So that smile.

[00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:10.550]
In fact, when Obama made the, um, the line about, uh, you know, ending the war in Iraq and

[00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:12.890]
all the money were peeing down the toilet on it.

[00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.670]
And everybody gave one of their 5,000 standing ovation.

[00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.390]
There was Jew Lieberman with that glib look on his face, the standing in it and

[00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.670]
blood.

[00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:21.210]
Oh my god.

[00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.650]
You talk about a walking ad for anti-semitism.

[00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:28.670]
Jesus, God Almighty.

[00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:32.510]
And then, and like I said afterward, when he gave him a hug, the obligatory hug, and

[00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:35.230]
isn't this the same Jew Lieberman that said he wasn't qualified to be president?

[00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.110]
Yeah, I think I heard him say that.

[00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:37.370]
Yeah.

[00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:43.130]
And was, uh, just joined to the hip of a machine here campaigning for the other guy.

[00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:44.890]
Not just campaigning.

[00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:47.190]
They were joined at the hip every time you saw a candle was doing.

[00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.370]
Rubbing his, sits us together.

[00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:53.890]
Oh, Joe says subject Bobby McGee.

[00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:54.810]
I see.

[00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:59.710]
I was curious and did watch the little toy soldier Bobby Punjab give the Republican

[00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.130]
response to last night's address.

[00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:06.330]
If he and Milf Palin are the best in Eocons condition for 2012, Obama's got it in the

[00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:06.590]
bag.

[00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.090]
If you take a turn and put it in a new Armani suit, it still reeks.

[00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.750]
Even Keith Overtments said, Oh, God is Bobby made his way to the camera.

[00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.030]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.050]
No, I think is what he really said was.

[00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.610]
Oh my god.

[00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:24.490]
Yeah, or maybe he said, by the way, look up, Bobby's real full name and tell me the

[00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.030]
Republicans are hypocrites for making a big to do about Obama's.

[00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.010]
Yeah, his name is Adam Schmendrick.

[00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.470]
Adam Oshmak sent me his real name.

[00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:34.110]
What is his real name?

[00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:35.610]
His first name.

[00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:37.570]
Who?

[00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:38.790]
Uh, Piyush.

[00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.450]
Why?

[00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.910]
Well, I mean, if your name was Piyush, wouldn't you change it to?

[00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:44.110]
Oh, yeah, there's something.

[00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.910]
Uh, there's just something about Nancy Pelosi.

[00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:46.110]
She closed me.

[00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.210]
It wants to shove her face into an apple peeler.

[00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:48.490]
Yeah.

[00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.910]
She'd make a great Mrs. Howell and Gilligan's Island remake.

[00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:56.890]
In fact, first, she says someone needs to put a seat belt on Nancy Pelosi's chair.

[00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:57.930]
That's what I was thinking.

[00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:02.250]
She was up and down like, um, like a lunatic, like a jacket a box.

[00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.690]
At first, she says she was up and down so much last night.

[00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:05.930]
Looks like she was doing aerobics.

[00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:08.950]
It's nice that she likes the president, but can't she tone it down a bit?

[00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:12.690]
In fact, you could see her prepping to stand up and do the standing evasion.

[00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.770]
She would like adjust yourself in a chair and you knew she was going to like,

[00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:19.730]
pop up again, you know, you always got that stupid drooling look on her face.

[00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:20.690]
Oh, God.

[00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:24.430]
Joe and Joe says this is good.

[00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:28.870]
PS didn't send Geissin fill in for you on Tuesday, January 12, 86.

[00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.910]
I just can't make it to the day without knowing for sure.

[00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.270]
And boy, Joe, excellent.

[00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:33.290]
Well said.

[00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:37.170]
Didn't this one do this and didn't know what to do that?

[00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:38.890]
And what if they did?

[00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.050]
What if they did?

[00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.850]
What's the upshot?

[00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:41.550]
What's the point?

[00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.190]
All these silly radio groupie types.

[00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.270]
So you're right about that.

[00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:52.190]
The radio groupies idiots, including Alan the fake Alice ran till nobody cares about.

[00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.190]
Tom don't like us.

[00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.150]
I read that thing the other day.

[00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:54.830]
He's off the air.

[00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.390]
They pulled a format grade.

[00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.490]
He didn't belong on here in the first place.

[00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:59.070]
He was an idiot.

[00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:04.490]
CT says morning, guys, this one to come out on the speech last night.

[00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:05.410]
I thought it was great.

[00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.830]
He's definitely on the right path with the right message in my opinion.

[00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.850]
Question, though, why did the Republicans answer every trouble facing us with tax cuts?

[00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.530]
Then they turn right around and say Obama and the Democrats are borrowing from the future.

[00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:16.490]
Give me a break.

[00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.790]
Are the majority of Americans stupid enough to buy that?

[00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:19.990]
I guess that's rhetorical.

[00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:24.270]
And of course, obviously they're not because they voted for Obama overwhelming a glanslide,

[00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.590]
landslide.

[00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.550]
But either way, you must leverage future money to stimulate economic growth today.

[00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.850]
I just thank Neil God that old man Mac was the one up there yesterday trying to inspire us

[00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.330]
with his Colostomy bag leaking.

[00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.850]
I wonder if Mac and Larry King swap Colostomy bags.

[00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:41.570]
Maybe not the whole bag, just the...

[00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:41.930]
Cube!

[00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.750]
Anyways, I'd like to nominate the Sion TC for the poll as well.

[00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.690]
What is that?

[00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:47.730]
I don't know.

[00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:48.630]
Oh, sorry.

[00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.870]
I don't know what it is.

[00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:51.430]
I've never heard of it.

[00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.410]
I'll put it on there.

[00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:55.810]
Every time I pull up next to one, I glance over hoping to see a busty 19-year-old with

[00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.350]
lots of hairspray and very little inhibitions.

[00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:58.510]
Thanks as always, CT.

[00:27:59.150 --> 00:27:59.830]
Hoping to see.

[00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.410]
Doesn't say that he does see a busty 19-year-old.

[00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:06.390]
But nevertheless, I don't know what that is.

[00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:07.330]
I'll be on what now?

[00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:08.910]
See, I don't know.

[00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:09.810]
I'll read it through it away.

[00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:10.430]
All right.

[00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:11.510]
I'm not going to put it on the floor.

[00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.170]
I'm too old to be able to pick up that piece of crap.

[00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:15.230]
Let's work for me.

[00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.550]
Now Robert says, good morning, Jens.

[00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:20.690]
Any chance of hearing Raging Bullwinkle this morning?

[00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:21.250]
Love the show.

[00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:22.470]
I have no idea what that is.

[00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:23.850]
I know there's talked dirty to Bullwinkle.

[00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.890]
You know, we have a bit called Raging Bullwinkle.

[00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:28.650]
Maybe we did, and he has a better memory than we do, but I don't regret it.

[00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:32.090]
Maybe that was the day that Saul Lipschitz filled it on the show.

[00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:35.130]
God!

[00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:35.930]
Moist.

[00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:36.310]
He pooped.

[00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:37.070]
Yeah.

[00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.590]
A.B.

[00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:38.490]
Heimed Hendrick.

[00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:43.270]
Here's a guy who says, I would add mini Cooper to the chick car pole.

[00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.450]
Well, you would, we won't.

[00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:45.350]
I would.

[00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:47.170]
As if.

[00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:49.550]
There's a list of like 5,000 cars on it.

[00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:50.170]
That should be enough.

[00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:57.550]
Oh, Sid Rosenbergstein, Kranzowitz Schwartz, so is Hendrick, says, I believe when my grandmother

[00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.770]
used the phrase, off to Lochis, it meant on purpose.

[00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:01.950]
Well, there's the fourth or fifth definition.

[00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:02.810]
This is great.

[00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:04.610]
Off to Lochis.

[00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:10.250]
See, this is the one thing about you, this is that we use a lot of words that we really

[00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.250]
don't know for sure what they mean.

[00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:12.110]
They just sound good.

[00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.730]
They sound great.

[00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:16.090]
They sound funny.

[00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.090]
I like he's in the tooth.

[00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:17.990]
Do you?

[00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.870]
All the time.

[00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.350]
Adam Oshmok says, his real name is Paiuch.

[00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.190]
What does he have that stage name?

[00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.190]
Is he that embarrassed by his family's heritage?

[00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:27.090]
Well, obviously, yes.

[00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.270]
The fact that he needs to lie about his identity really makes me question what he'd ever

[00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:32.070]
do if he got into government.

[00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.770]
He is in government.

[00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.690]
He's in there from Louisiana.

[00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.470]
Not only that, but he also speaks like a redneck.

[00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.570]
If you think Bush spoke like a moron, he ain't heard nothing yet.

[00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.710]
A redneck Indian guy, that's interesting.

[00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:47.330]
Oh, yeah, I'm getting some money from my birthday, March versus Adam.

[00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:48.350]
What should I spend it on?

[00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:50.590]
I was thinking about some nice BC Bud.

[00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:51.310]
Any suggestions?

[00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:53.030]
How do you like that?

[00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:54.430]
We got lawbreakers out there.

[00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:55.990]
BC Bud, my ass.

[00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:56.530]
Shaveful.

[00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:57.010]
How do you do that?

[00:29:57.450 --> 00:29:59.710]
Probably got the guys out there doing Roids too.

[00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:03.170]
And the fake Adam Kirschner writes about the fake Tom Jekker.

[00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.730]
This is beautiful.

[00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:05.230]
Yeah.

[00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.730]
This is the fake Tom Jekker was right about Rick Sances.

[00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.250]
He did fill in on one day when you were on vacation at WIOD.

[00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.270]
George doesn't remember this.

[00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:13.310]
Not sure about the others.

[00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:15.610]
No, I don't.

[00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.570]
Who the F cares?

[00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.150]
That's the answer to the question.

[00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.790]
Who cares?

[00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.190]
George doesn't remember it.

[00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:24.770]
I don't remember it.

[00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.290]
Probably Ricky Tickey don't remember it either.

[00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.210]
And who cares?

[00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.370]
Oh, it didn't he fill in one day and then Alan Burke

[00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:31.430]
come over the Dean.

[00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.270]
And if I had produced the show with Rick Sances there,

[00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:36.490]
I would have remembered it.

[00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:36.790]
Right.

[00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.010]
But it didn't happen.

[00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:38.670]
I remember.

[00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:41.070]
I do remember the day that what's his name?

[00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:41.830]
Brian Adams.

[00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:42.630]
Who?

[00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.570]
Brian what's his name?

[00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:46.210]
Little Brian.

[00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:48.630]
The little Queen.

[00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:49.930]
Craig?

[00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:51.710]
No, not Brian Craig.

[00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:53.110]
Brian Craig never works for us.

[00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.350]
I know, but you said little Queen.

[00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.210]
So a different little Queen.

[00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:56.770]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:58.410]
Andrews?

[00:30:58.530 --> 00:30:59.470]
Brian Andrews.

[00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:00.250]
What did I call him?

[00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:01.250]
Adams.

[00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:03.750]
Oh, we're running out of material folks.

[00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:04.690]
Yeah, obviously.

[00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:08.690]
I only remember Randy Rickensuds, Defo.

[00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:10.890]
Show 100 filling in for you.

[00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:13.110]
Fill 100 I don't know if he ever did actually fill in for you.

[00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:14.750]
But Vee and the Mepho filled in on my show.

[00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:15.790]
I'm still on the air.

[00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:17.210]
Wow, what an accomplishment that is.

[00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:18.910]
It's supposed to be a week and only last the two days.

[00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:19.590]
Whoa.

[00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:20.550]
What Mepho?

[00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:20.990]
Yeah.

[00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:21.650]
Really?

[00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:22.030]
Yeah.

[00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:23.170]
Why how embarrassing?

[00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.650]
Well, you've got a memory for some real,

[00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.070]
maybe you could hang out with it.

[00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:29.530]
I remember those if I was there.

[00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.430]
I see.

[00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:32.330]
Now what was they're going to say?

[00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:35.330]
Oh, Brian Andrews tossing it back to his colleague, Adam

[00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:35.710]
Kirschner.

[00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:36.070]
Remember that?

[00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.330]
There was some news thing going on.

[00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:38.910]
Now back to my colleague.

[00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:41.330]
And he wished he was his colleague.

[00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:42.330]
That's a fact.

[00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:43.230]
Yeah.

[00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.970]
He wished he had him on a leash like a colleague.

[00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.710]
Back to my colleague in the studio.

[00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:53.790]
Yeah.

[00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:54.970]
What a joke.

[00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.470]
So that was a food farm channel seven speaking of WSV.

[00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:58.350]
And that was a food farm.

[00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:59.030]
Oh, man.

[00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:00.230]
What a secret.

[00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:01.250]
Yeah.

[00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.150]
I wonder how the paper boys do in these days.

[00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:05.390]
So I'm on the YouTube to share.

[00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:06.750]
Happy new year.

[00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:06.750]

[00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:08.790]
For the record, have you ever used

[00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:11.090]
steroids, human growth, form owner,

[00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.470]
any other performance enhancing substance?

[00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:14.170]
No.

[00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.870]
When I'm asked by the press, hey, Erad,

[00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:21.750]
why are you a heating club like Barry Bond?

[00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:27.190]
I just poorly respond that I was young and dumb.

[00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:33.050]
I was young and stupid and dumb.

[00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:39.190]
The rights for agents and a fabulous list can make a million there.

[00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:44.510]
Out of a dumb ass kid, all you got to do is treat

[00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.490]
if you're young and dumb.

[00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:49.930]
Young and stupid.

[00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:57.170]
I was young and dumb, but what's more important

[00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:02.150]
is that I can't let Madonna find out I'm hung like a nut.

[00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:05.950]
You know, I was young and dumb.

[00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:08.810]
Young and dumb.

[00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:14.750]
All you boys and girls who want to be playing one day

[00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:19.990]
in the major leagues just lie a lot and cheat.

[00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:21.730]
I was young.

[00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:23.570]
I was stupid, stupid, stupid.

[00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:24.630]
Periodic jerk.

[00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:29.790]
It's 10.45, but most of yesterday's games are down the drain on the down, down 185.

[00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:35.370]
So I guess it's a selling opportunity when you say, sure.

[00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:40.490]
Oklahoma, Johnny, another of fake says, I'm glad to have heard you mention it was

[00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:41.110]
asked Wednesday.

[00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:42.810]
I went to mass this morning at 7 a.m.

[00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.050]
I don't like dealing with the crowds of people who come to the night mass.

[00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.250]
Don't understand why they fill the church four times a year

[00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:49.590]
while the rest of us come every week.

[00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.950]
What are you abstaining from this lint period?

[00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.610]
Oh, this is when they had that lintel soup, isn't it?

[00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:56.010]
Oh, that'd be 30 lint.

[00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:56.190]

[00:33:58.690 --> 00:33:59.050]
No.

[00:33:59.530 --> 00:33:59.710]
No.

[00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:00.990]
It's not?

[00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.350]
No.

[00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.390]
I thought lentil soup was like that soup was named after lint.

[00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:06.210]
I don't know.

[00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:06.750]
Maybe it is.

[00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:07.150]
I don't know.

[00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:08.190]
I don't think so.

[00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:09.570]
It sucks, anyway.

[00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:10.410]
It's made from lentils.

[00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:12.630]
Remember, Yantle Green?

[00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:13.870]
Yep.

[00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.570]
I'm abstaining from television says Oklahoma, Johnny, fake.

[00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:22.850]
I hope you consider abstaining from something that is sinful or it's a very least something for your emotional health or physical health.

[00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:23.370]
No, I'm not.

[00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:26.290]
I suggest you abstain from bedding.

[00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.190]
And as a matter of fact, two o'clock I'll be out the door.

[00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.550]
It's just a morage.

[00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:32.530]
You derive false enjoyment from that activity.

[00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:34.350]
It's not kosher either from what I've studied.

[00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:36.650]
It is gambling kosher.

[00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:38.270]
It depends on what kind of a machine it is.

[00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:42.290]
It depends on if it's got a picture of Gary Sarner or Julie Burman on the side of the machine.

[00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:45.670]
40 days and 40 nights is not that long.

[00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.510]
It'll be a real test of yourself discipline.

[00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:50.570]
Peace be with you in your show regards the fake Oklahoma, Johnny.

[00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:52.130]
Peace be with you.

[00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:53.630]
Peace of this.

[00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:54.190]
Peace of that.

[00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:55.110]
Peace of monkey pie.

[00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:57.590]
Peace of bullcraft.

[00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:00.830]
That's what all that ass wins these stuff is.

[00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:03.810]
And that was your vice president sitting there with a bunch of asses.

[00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:05.930]
Asses, asses, and she made on his forehead.

[00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:07.950]
I'm sure all the cops want nuts.

[00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:09.070]
What?

[00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.650]
I'm sure all the Catholics were like giving him a standing ovation.

[00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.470]
Were they really?

[00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:15.150]
I don't know.

[00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.810]
Brandon says Channel 7 is still a food forum.

[00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:22.010]
Just heading up at the top of the list is Craig and Spilky's Nare.

[00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.490]
How velkies is the lead anchor I'll never understand.

[00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:27.850]
Well, how a lot of those people around here.

[00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:30.150]
Oh, I see Dr. Henry Finkelstein.

[00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.830]
I'm blocking you.

[00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:31.750]
You're you're boring.

[00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:33.090]
Boring.

[00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:34.690]
You know who I'm talking about?

[00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:37.250]
Dr. Professor Henry Henry, I think I think we'll see.

[00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:38.110]
Boring.

[00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:39.110]
Go away.

[00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:44.490]
Here's one from Snooki with a poll suggestion.

[00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.110]
Keep up the great show.

[00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.290]
You and George make this happen.

[00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:48.130]
Screw all the haters.

[00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:48.950]
Yes, screw them.

[00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:50.730]
Sign another Jorge.

[00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:55.110]
The most comfortable type of underwear is boxers, boxers,

[00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.690]
briefs, tidy whiteies, briefs, speedo, thong like.

[00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.250]
I don't wear underwear and WTF.

[00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:00.390]
Oh, that's okay.

[00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:02.430]
I think we've taken an underwear poll before.

[00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:03.170]
Haven't we, really?

[00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:03.850]
But you might have.

[00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:06.890]
See, there you go again.

[00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:09.430]
It's not even noon and I'll be your start with that fact stuff.

[00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:10.610]
Don't blame me, blame George.

[00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:13.950]
Blame George, he tries to lead me down to Garham Path,

[00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:15.190]
the Gaden Path.

[00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.690]
Oving about those guys like, what's his name?

[00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:19.930]
Adam Campbell.

[00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:22.070]
Was that his name, Adam?

[00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:23.470]
I'm not sure.

[00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:24.530]
I'm not either.

[00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.970]
Nobody knows what he is.

[00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.190]

[00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:27.250]
No, he's a brand new.

[00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.210]
No, he's not brand new.

[00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.070]
Alex Campbell, I'm sorry.

[00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.470]
Alex.

[00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:37.350]
We've got so many atoms with so many fake emails, you know.

[00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.970]
Here's one from Ron who says, what a speech last night.

[00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:43.090]
Did you watch an MSNBC?

[00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.910]
Yeah, I did.

[00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:46.770]
But after they finished schmoozing, I turned it off.

[00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.030]
I did not see Obermann say, oh my god,

[00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:52.130]
into an open mic is Bobby Jindall walked out looking like a vampire.

[00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:54.110]
says here looking like a vampire.

[00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.970]
What a hoot.

[00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:58.750]
We can only hope the GOP runs a pale and Jindall ticket in 2012.

[00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:00.690]
And I'll rub ticket for an old rubination.

[00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.450]
Have a good day to you and George says Ron.

[00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:04.970]
Well, thanks a lot Ron.

[00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:05.770]
Thanks Ron.

[00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:07.790]
So how do you spell that Yiddish thing that you're saying?

[00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:08.850]
I'm going to do my own research.

[00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:11.210]
Off to what's it?

[00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:12.410]
I don't know how you're spilling.

[00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:13.490]
Give me a start.

[00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:14.190]
Give me something.

[00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:14.470]
Guess.

[00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.630]
OF.

[00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:17.170]
AF.

[00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.550]
AUF.

[00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:21.390]
Give me some more two words.

[00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:22.090]
AUF what?

[00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:23.990]
That's one word, right?

[00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:25.830]
The second word, just a second.

[00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:26.290]
What I'm saying.

[00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:30.410]
TDX.

[00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:34.590]
Oh, I already tossed it.

[00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:35.190]
I schmick him.

[00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:36.490]
What do you think it's going to be?

[00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:37.290]
Just a minute.

[00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:39.390]
Google's fine about correcting your spelling.

[00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.550]
Can't find it one minute.

[00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.750]
One moment.

[00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:45.570]
All right.

[00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:46.790]
We've got four hours.

[00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:47.090]
Don't worry.

[00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:47.490]
Take your time.

[00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.990]
I am.

[00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.570]
I'm digging through the waste basket.

[00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:57.050]
Off to Loch instead of the...

[00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.230]
I don't know what the hell I did with that one.

[00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.990]
No.

[00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:04.170]
Can't find it.

[00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:06.750]
I'm off to Ojas.

[00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:16.010]
I'll figure it out.

[00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:17.350]
Don't worry about it.

[00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:18.210]
How do you spell it?

[00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:19.130]
I just got to keep me updates.

[00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:21.070]
Oh, here's one from Ed.

[00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:23.690]
I remember the day that the Malalukov lady filled in for you.

[00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:25.550]
Yeah, I remember that one.

[00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.210]
I think T. Crawford was the engineer for that show.

[00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:31.810]
Not.

[00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:35.370]
Jimmy Cifala says, oh, this is good.

[00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.410]
Subject.

[00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:37.130]
Retire.

[00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:42.050]
Oh, you wish little Jimmy.

[00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:42.630]
Hey, Jimmy.

[00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:43.250]
You're fairy.

[00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:44.750]
You're memory is so bad.

[00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.010]
Even I remember Ricky Sanchez and W.I.O.D.

[00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:48.670]
It's time to hang it up and return.

[00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:49.510]
Not so gracefully.

[00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.550]
You made a career out of badmouthing my friends.

[00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:52.630]
I don't forgive you for it.

[00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:55.010]
And Bishop did nothing to deserve your attacks over the years.

[00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:55.870]
He was a class act.

[00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:57.230]
She was not a class act.

[00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:04.470]
She was a hateful, sour, fat bull-dike bitch, a class act, a humorless bull-dike bitch.

[00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:05.130]
A bitch act.

[00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:07.030]
Yeah, she was an ass clown.

[00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:13.050]
I have one thing to say to her and Sandy Peyton and her dead body, Opsulokas.

[00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:20.510]
We don't know for sure what it means, but here's one that says, I'm going to preface this

[00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.470]
by saying I'm a Democrat.

[00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:22.250]
I voted for a bomb.

[00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:26.270]
I wish he just exiled every Republican to a remote, cheap hurting island in the North Atlantic,

[00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:29.170]
which would then be summarily bombed off the face of the earth.

[00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.430]
That being said, I need to ask you this.

[00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:36.190]
Is there anyone out there who holds an opposing viewpoint of your own who isn't an idiot?

[00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.990]
An idiot, if someone doesn't know what day of the week it is, does know what the capital

[00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:41.430]
of the U.S. or America is.

[00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:44.090]
Couldn't find Italy on a map if he told him it's a country looks like a boot.

[00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:45.770]
George W. Bush is an idiot.

[00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:49.650]
George W. Bush couldn't spell cat if he spotted him to see in the tee.

[00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:51.150]
Bobby Gindall is not an idiot.

[00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:54.810]
He's a Rhodes scholar who performed well enough at Brown University to garner acceptance

[00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:56.850]
into Harvard Medical School and Year Law School.

[00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:59.550]
Bobby Gindall is a very smart man.

[00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.630]
He also happens to be inherently evil and corrupt.

[00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:04.510]
He's Hitler with a dot on his forehead.

[00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:09.210]
Yes, he does have extreme far-right fundamentalist political and religious views, which is unfortunate,

[00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:12.850]
and I disagree with him vehemently on his views, but holding those views does make him

[00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:13.090]
an idiot.

[00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:13.850]
Yes, it does.

[00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:16.470]
See, book learning, and he can have all the degrees in the world.

[00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:18.390]
There's all kinds of smarts.

[00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.110]
It doesn't make him stupid.

[00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:25.350]
It just makes him a dangerous man and just who happens to be really, really smart.

[00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:27.070]
Yeah, like Frato, smart.

[00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:28.350]
That's what I would say.

[00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:31.310]
Bobby Gindall is smart like Frato.

[00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:33.110]
I agree with you.

[00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:35.990]
You don't have to be religious to be crazy, but you have to be crazy to be religious,

[00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:41.150]
but crazy and stupid don't go necessarily hand in hand, says whoever this is.

[00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:42.370]
They hang out together a lot.

[00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:44.010]
Who's that?

[00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:44.830]
Crazy and stupid.

[00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.990]
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't, they're probably lunching it today.

[00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.070]
It wouldn't surprise me.

[00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:53.510]
Now take her park, and that's a lady.

[00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.310]
Yes.

[00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:56.070]
You know who that is?

[00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:56.970]
Do you get stuff from her?

[00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.570]
I do.

[00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:00.450]
I think she's kind to like take her crap.

[00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:04.990]
It says, good morning, Neil and George, you may have received an empty email from me.

[00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:05.510]
Yes, I did.

[00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.110]
I'm sorry about that.

[00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:11.310]
I've just spent 30 minutes laboring over an email to both of you, both expressing how

[00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:16.110]
frustrating I'm about the quality of Los Angeles radio when I clicked send that for

[00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:21.390]
a bison hotmail crap down and 30 minutes about how frustrated she is over the quality.

[00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:23.510]
Why do we care about the quality of LA radio?

[00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:24.270]
Do we care about it?

[00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:25.370]
Absolutely not.

[00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:27.210]
Does our audience care about it?

[00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:27.370]
No.

[00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:28.070]

[00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:30.750]
Basically, Los Angeles radio sucks.

[00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:33.950]
Well, you could have left Los Angeles out of that take her.

[00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:37.890]
Radio stations are switching formats like it's a swingers party.

[00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:40.510]
And the last decent radio host don't have criminal convictions ever been kicked to

[00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:40.810]
the curb.

[00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:45.570]
I received an email survey today from the only classic rock station in LA requesting

[00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:49.230]
my opinion on things like streaming archive podcast, meal deals, etc.

[00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:51.650]
All things you both talked about these past couple of months.

[00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:55.990]
I was able to put down the Neil Rogers show WQM for two questions that pertained to where

[00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:59.850]
did I learn and discover and listen to new music.

[00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:02.570]
Both of you playing the discussed a lot of music I've never heard before.

[00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:03.690]
I played new music.

[00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:05.010]
New to her?

[00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:05.890]
Oh.

[00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:07.870]
Have a great day.

[00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:08.590]
Keep up the good work.

[00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:09.170]
All at the best.

[00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:09.810]
You get you down.

[00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.470]
PS jolly jojack asses a douchebox.

[00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:15.170]
She must know it.

[00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.610]
Uh huh.

[00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.610]
Phenomeness to despise him to revile.

[00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:22.590]
Oh, fat off to Lochis.

[00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:25.270]
I'm not having a lot of luck.

[00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:26.950]
I'll take a one a UF.

[00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:29.850]
TSU LA C H A S.

[00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:32.610]
That's as close as I can come to spelling it.

[00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:36.210]
TSU LA C H A S a U F.

[00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:38.010]
Yeah, separate word to Lochis.

[00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:42.130]
And what the hell difference does it make what it means when you come right down to it?

[00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:43.250]
I mean, I just mentioned it.

[00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:44.970]
I'll never get a rest.

[00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:48.650]
I would have had like 85 different definitions all of which are probably wrong.

[00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:52.750]
Just like the thing about oh, when did Henry Barrow fill in for you on your vacation in IOD?

[00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:58.010]
When did the guy with the eyes fill in a week on vacation?

[00:42:58.210 --> 00:42:59.390]
You know, all of a sudden the crap.

[00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:02.510]
This all comes back to the same IOD Groupies.

[00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.570]
Whoever is behind all this fake, this and fake that.

[00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:07.770]
Like I said, get out the freakin' piano wire.

[00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:08.930]
Oh, Neal!

[00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.370]
You're nothing to Neil Rogers.

[00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:11.770]
Well, here we go again, honey.

[00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:14.010]
This is the Neau Rogers show.

[00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:16.770]
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, your brand.

[00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:19.730]
Any questions?

[00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:23.610]
And now here's another exciting offer from Video Treasure Chest.

[00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:25.930]
Just in time for Bernie Cabell's birthday.

[00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:29.090]
The loveboat was about life on a romantic cruise ship.

[00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:34.370]
But the pilot episode featured a ship that wasn't nearly as nice as this lost classic shows.

[00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:37.910]
I am Julia Kruehn, Director of Okma Boy.

[00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:40.590]
Shut up! I hope you're not gonna make a story of me stupid.

[00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:43.250]
I'm stupid. Wow, we're charades, I hate that.

[00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:44.670]
Shut up! What is that, boy?

[00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:46.850]
Screw you, I can need that stupid job.

[00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:47.770]
Is there a problem?

[00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:49.650]
Get them stupid. Who's the ball game?

[00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:51.010]
Bronsom on bad, brother.

[00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:52.670]
I hate you, I hate all of you.

[00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:53.470]
Hey, look me.

[00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:54.750]
I love this ship.

[00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:55.790]
Yeah, well, I love you.

[00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:57.410]
Shut up! Shut up!

[00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:03.990]
The original pilot for the love boat, the LOAD boat can be yours for just 1995 in local video stores.

[00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:06.650]
Video treasure chest. We've got rooms of this crap.

[00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:11.130]
It's 11 o'clock at 5.60 W.A.M. and let's take over that pool, what do you say?

[00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:12.670]
Do it or not.

[00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:15.030]

[00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.910]
Miata.

[00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:30.170]
Actually, I wasn't a bad little car as I recall.

[00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:32.330]
Was it?

[00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:33.070]
They looked nice.

[00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:34.810]
I bet that's what I mean.

[00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:37.990]
VW Beetle 91 Pontiac Fioro 29.

[00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.110]
How about a solstice?

Oft Zulakis in spite in order to spite.

[00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:17.250]
That's what we got yesterday.

[00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:20.910]
Today in order to spite.

[00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:22.470]
Sounds right.

[00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:23.250]
Jolly Jovelle.

[00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:24.810]
I bet he says that all the time.

[00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:25.410]
Oft Zulakis.

[00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:27.730]
Because that's his motto.

[00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:30.290]
Everything he does is for spite.

[00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:33.350]
No, I don't like that fat hank here.

[00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:34.570]
I don't like that fat knee.

[00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:35.570]
I don't like this one.

[00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:40.410]
And so he just, you know, goes through life, ruining your other people's lives.

[00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:43.710]
That's his goal and doing a hell of a good job of it, too, by the way.

[00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:49.910]
Oh, thanks in advance for the overnight for overnighting.

[00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:54.770]
Tell your little bald friend that I don't send stuff on orders.

[00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:55.830]
You just did.

[00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:57.450]
I just did what?

[00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:58.010]
Told him.

[00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:02.210]
Thanks for overnighting my check.

[00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:03.290]
You'll get it when you get it.

[00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:06.150]
Okay, when I'm going to ready to send it, then you'll get it.

[00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:08.250]
I'm dying.

[00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:09.930]
I'm starving.

[00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:11.450]
Well, go get the dumpster.

[00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:11.710]
You're okay.

[00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:12.450]
Go behind public.

[00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:13.010]
I bet you this.

[00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.930]
I'm really good crap in the dumpster.

[00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:20.410]
Don't forget to join the jury or maybe George will buy a bunch of groceries.

[00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:21.310]
That's a good idea.

[00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:26.110]
You ought to take chicken egg tomorrow to a public and do shopping.

[00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:27.450]
Okay.

[00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:29.310]
Buy five, six hundred bucks worth of groceries.

[00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:31.290]
Fill up his frigid air and his cupboards.

[00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:33.270]
Pay his mortgage payment.

[00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:39.330]
Join George this Friday, 10 to 2 at Gulf Stream Park in Casino and Halendale.

[00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:40.970]
Come buy for great horse racing.

[00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:41.830]
Play a little bit of poker.

[00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.310]
Maybe hit the spots for big money.

[00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:46.070]
We got our pick-up pony deal going on Friday too, like we do every week.

[00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:47.570]
How long does that thing go by the way?

[00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:48.790]
I don't know.

[00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:52.230]
Oh, plus enjoy some great food and drinks while Neil and George get ready for the fountain

[00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:54.630]
of youth steaks this Saturday at Gulf Stream Park.

[00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:58.990]
Can't wait to see if I can redeem myself this Friday.

[00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:02.630]
After that horse doctor, Uga Bougal last week didn't run a step.

[00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:03.310]
Didn't run a lick.

[00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:05.290]
I don't want to.

[00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:06.430]
Hit him again.

[00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:06.790]
Come on.

[00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:07.570]
I don't want to.

[00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:09.230]
He didn't run at all.

[00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:10.730]
Rupert Chuchu is back again.

[00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:12.250]
Subjects.

[00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:13.410]
Slim but athletic build.

[00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:15.730]
Sounds really gay to me.

[00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:17.530]
Slim but athletic build.

[00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:18.650]
Ha ha ha.

[00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:21.130]
It says hilarious reaction by Georgie boy.

[00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:22.890]
The truth hurts.

[00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:23.490]
Doesn't it punk?

[00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:24.790]
So I'm a fat slob.

[00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:25.190]
Yeah, you are.

[00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:27.550]
Well, as a matter of fact, I'm six one hundred eighty five pounds.

[00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:28.510]
Slim but athletic build.

[00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:29.930]
That shut in is what you are.

[00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:30.750]
I'd run.

[00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:31.710]
10 miles away.

[00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:33.330]
While you're playing hopscots with your daughter.

[00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:34.350]
That's the sake of our problem.

[00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:36.330]
I'll go along with the fact that she is yours, Georgie.

[00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:37.630]
I'm a married professional.

[00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:39.870]
Also have a couple of regular ladies as well.

[00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:41.610]
Not to mention the one I'd stand on you.

[00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:41.950]
Oh, yeah.

[00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.630]
I'm living the life you wish you had.

[00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:44.210]
Oh, yeah.

[00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:46.790]
Georgie, I don't have to ask permission to go out.

[00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:47.250]
Uh huh.

[00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.970]
Neil, honestly, Georgie is a repellent for your show.

[00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:52.150]
How does it edition by subtraction sound to you?

[00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:55.350]
I'll tell you how all your emails sound like real kaka.

[00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:56.610]
John's ETR.

[00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:58.550]
This is his new creation.

[00:47:58.730 --> 00:47:58.890]
Sure.

[00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:00.410]
Rooster Cogburn.

[00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:03.070]
Oh my God.

[00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:05.130]
As the rooster crows.

[00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:08.270]
He's got a slim athletic build and he gets laid.

[00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.850]
Who cares?

[00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.430]
Oh, yeah.

[00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:10.130]
Who cares?

[00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:12.690]
He gets laid in his own mind.

[00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:17.970]
Oh, here's one from Kim, who already sent me this once before, but was so, uh, so,

[00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:20.430]
uh, dismayed that I didn't read the first time.

[00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:22.230]
I shamed Candid and why I'm reading it now.

[00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:22.970]
I have no idea.

[00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:26.530]
Yo, Neil, I was the guy who told you about your so-called friend Tom Jicke.

[00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:29.050]
Misspelled when I heard him on the Sid Rosencrantz.

[00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:31.450]
Should go back to F.A. New York, uh, ju-show.

[00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:33.410]
Nice friend.

[00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:34.250]
He hasn't called you since.

[00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:37.530]
He hasn't, as a matter of fact, two days ago, he sent me a nice email to real Tom Jicke

[00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:39.110]
and said, you're full of crap.

[00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:44.030]
Well, if it's any constellation, Moa Howard was on Sid's show yesterday.

[00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:47.890]
And although Sid asked him about his time at five, 60, Moa didn't say anything negative

[00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:49.010]
or positive about you.

[00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:51.030]
At least you still have Moa as a friend.

[00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:52.190]
Take care in your show.

[00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.750]
It's still great.

[00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:53.310]
Says Kim.

[00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:54.610]
Oh, God.

[00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:55.970]
A real Yinta.

[00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:57.590]
A makeup Yinta.

[00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:58.030]
Bap, bap.

[00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:00.510]
It's one thing to be a Yinta and report stuff that really happens.

[00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:02.430]
It's another thing to be a make-believe Yinta.

[00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:03.510]
Just make crap up.

[00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:04.230]
I should admit to Sterber.

[00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:10.470]
Or as somebody I know used to say, I bet he's probably dead by now.

[00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:12.430]
I'll find it.

[00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:16.490]
Take your time.

[00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:18.270]
Oh, here it is.

[00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:19.910]
He's an Ojón provocateur.

[00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:20.290]
Right.

[00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:22.610]
Trouble making peace of turd with no life.

[00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:29.290]
You're a so-called friend Tom Jicke and you ought to see the way they spell, you know.

[00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:32.730]
Oh, this, I didn't get to this one yet.

[00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:33.770]
I can't believe that.

[00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:37.010]
Two pages from Bart and Raymond, really.

[00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:38.910]
I told you about this one.

[00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.910]
Bert and Ernie.

[00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:42.410]
Neil, this is a very long email.

[00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:44.210]
More than your everyday email, but please read.

[00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:46.290]
I try to recount the events as best I could.

[00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:47.950]
Simpleton.

[00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:51.010]
Going back to the guy who said not everybody who disagrees is an idiot.

[00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:52.210]
This isn't about disagreeing.

[00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:53.290]
This is just about being stupid.

[00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:55.150]
Stupid is as stupid does.

[00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:59.330]
I have written you before asking if you could talk about your private life on the

[00:49:59.330 --> 00:49:59.530]
ear.

[00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:03.310]
The reason being that me and my friend at work don't think you are a gay man, that you

[00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:04.570]
were in fact as straight as an arrow.

[00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:07.870]
When you and your friend at work are full of crap and you're going to get your own life

[00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:08.390]
by the way.

[00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:10.070]
Here's how it all started.

[00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:11.730]
I'll try to be as detailed as I can.

[00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:15.550]
I listen to your show along with my friend Raymond during breaks at work.

[00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:19.430]
I bet he's doing other stuff with his friend Raymond during breaks at work.

[00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:20.090]
No question.

[00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:23.570]
Anyway, we were talking about you in the lunchroom when another co-worker overheard your name.

[00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:26.110]
He said, are you guys talking about Neil Rogers from the radio?

[00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:27.750]
We nodded yes.

[00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:31.050]
And then he quickly followed with something that made our jaws drop in shock.

[00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:34.330]
Oh, you know, he's not really gay, right?

[00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:36.170]
He said, we asked what do you mean?

[00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:39.370]
Just when you heard he replied, Neil Rogers, the radio guy is not gay.

[00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:40.070]
It's all a stick.

[00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.930]
Think about it.

[00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:42.170]
When did Neil come out of the closet?

[00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:44.330]
In the 70s we replied, that's right.

[00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:47.410]
He said in the 70s in the beginning of his career, we need something big to put him on

[00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:47.770]
the map.

[00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.950]
Oh my God.

[00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:50.990]
Talk about stupid is a stupid does.

[00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:56.410]
In 1976 when Anita Bryant was staring the Fag Witch Hunts in Dave County when all

[00:50:56.410 --> 00:50:57.490]
that crap was on a ballot.

[00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:02.850]
That was a really smart time to put yourself on the map as being an out of the closet

[00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:03.350]
Fag.

[00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:03.830]
You idiot.

[00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:04.730]
You moron.

[00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:08.750]
Me and my friends sat there but couldn't believe it because for the 15 years we've

[00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:11.050]
listened to your show, we never would have thought of something like that.

[00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:14.250]
But we listened intently to what this guy was saying because it sounded like there could

[00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:15.410]
be some truth of the whole deal.

[00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:16.130]
Well, guess what?

[00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:16.590]
There's not.

[00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:19.570]
Think about this also.

[00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:21.050]
Where does Neil live now in Canada?

[00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:23.830]
In Canada where he has privacy, nobody recognizes him.

[00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:27.690]
After years of hiding the fact that he was indeed a straight man and hiding his long time

[00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:30.110]
girlfriend, he decided to move away where nobody would know.

[00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:33.010]
It's a Toronto where there's more fags than you can shake a stick at.

[00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:34.170]
What?

[00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:36.310]
Your stick at.

[00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:36.530]
Oh.

[00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:37.890]
Hockey stick.

[00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:42.630]
At that point, me and my friend were speechless because in one fell swoop, this man

[00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:44.370]
was shattering the image we had of you near Rogers.

[00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:46.890]
But how can someone keep something so well hidden?

[00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:47.410]
It's impossible.

[00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:51.350]
I told him here we spotted Neil's in the media has power of some kind and probably had

[00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:52.270]
the story suppressed.

[00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:54.630]
The stories of my being hetero, right?

[00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:56.430]
This was amazing.

[00:51:56.930 --> 00:52:00.550]
Then me and my friend decided to take a picture of you and show it to our co-workers

[00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.470]
and ask them if they thought you were a straighter gay man.

[00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:05.130]
Most people agree that while you looked creepy, you were all man.

[00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:12.070]
Oh, this is just, this is one of the all-time best or worst depending on your perspective.

[00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:16.690]
I don't know if this is true or not, but it makes sense since you keep your private life hidden well.

[00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:19.030]
If this is true, me and my friend applaud you.

[00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:22.590]
You've managed to pull a prank of Andy Kaufman like proportions.

[00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:25.150]
Neil, please once and for all, clear this one up.

[00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:27.450]
If this is true, please don't read on the ear.

[00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:29.430]
We don't want you to get in trouble with your or your people.

[00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:31.090]
You or your people.

[00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:36.010]
Me and my friend joke that by the time you read this email, you'll have sent for someone to have us killed.

[00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:36.930]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:39.630]
Anyway, please tell us what is the truth.

[00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:44.930]
It's had taken us weeks to sum up the cohorts to send us into you two fans who think you rock Barton Raymond.

[00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:47.230]
Well, guess what? I'm all gay.

[00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:48.490]
99 and 910.

[00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:49.250]
Yeah, 100%.

[00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:50.270]
Yeah, 400%.

[00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:50.790]
Yeah, fag.

[00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:51.230]
Okay.

[00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:54.830]
But you continue because you guys have no lives.

[00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:55.410]
I have no lives.

[00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:56.810]
You continue fantasizing about mine.

[00:52:57.330 --> 00:53:01.170]
I said that back at the time, the first of stuff about why don't you talk more about your private life?

[00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:02.310]
Because it's none of your effing business.

[00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:02.950]
How do you like that?

[00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:03.210]
Right.

[00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:05.070]
None of your stinking business.

[00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:10.610]
Chris says Uncle Neil, I don't get to listen to the show a lot.

[00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:13.690]
Unfortunately, I have a life, but I do check the articles you've posted whenever I can.

[00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:16.690]
I'm surprised you haven't posted anything about Tom Amiano.

[00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:17.390]
Oh, yeah.

[00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:21.470]
Remember I read the story yesterday and his proposal legalized in taxpayer wine in California.

[00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:21.930]
Yes.

[00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:24.850]
Not only did I post this story, I read it on the show yesterday.

[00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:29.990]
Is there any chance that the economic implosion is forcing people to have some common sense?

[00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:31.030]
Anyway, I love the show.

[00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:32.630]
Hope you keep going till the day you die in a year.

[00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:33.490]
This is Chris.

[00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:38.550]
I'm surprised you haven't posted anything about Tom Amiano.

[00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:39.290]
Get with it.

[00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:39.950]
Will you?

[00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:45.590]
Chris, read it on the year yesterday and post it on our website the night before.

[00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:47.190]
For yesterday's reading and breeding.

[00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:50.070]
Oh, God.

[00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:51.010]
It's just...

[00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:51.630]
I have no life.

[00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:52.190]
...traget.

[00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:54.950]
Traget doesn't come close to it.

[00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:56.810]
I thought the calls were bad, but these emails.

[00:53:57.370 --> 00:53:58.670]
They make you want to give up on life.

[00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:01.450]
Did you catch my drift?

[00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:02.250]
Oh, yeah.

[00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:03.790]
You didn't even show it yet.

[00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.810]
What day is today?

[00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:07.130]
Wednesday?

[00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:08.650]
Oh, tomorrow we got the anneal deal.

[00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:10.090]
Right.

[00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:13.230]
In fact, I'm going to talk about it right now.

[00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:13.790]
Nice segue.

[00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:16.490]
And then Friday we got the pickup pony thing.

[00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:17.450]
And, uh, Gulfstream.

[00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:18.590]
And Gulfstream.

[00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:19.690]
Georgia, be a Gulfstream on Friday.

[00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:20.990]
Go see him, bring him a bag of money.

[00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:21.370]
Right.

[00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:24.950]
Go bring him a nice $50 ticket to win on every horse in some race.

[00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:26.450]
That's a good idea.

[00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:28.470]
Then you'll cash.

[00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:31.270]
Of course, with the Eurolach, it'll probably be some like one to nine shot.

[00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.590]
You know.

[00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:32.710]
Oh, well, it's all good.

[00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:36.290]
Eurogist got new from the makers of TickTacks.

[00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:38.950]
In association with antibiotics anytime enterprises.

[00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:41.270]
It's the new A-ron TickTacks.

[00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:44.070]
A-ron TickTacks.

[00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:46.230]
You're all burning beds with the facts.

[00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.830]
Hey, Dad.

[00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:48.910]
I've been taking the new A-ron TickTacks.

[00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:50.510]
I can't wait to little exhaust.

[00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:54.110]
We got those from our cousin in the Dominican Republic.

[00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:55.490]
Don't tell the other kids.

[00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:56.910]
Oh, okay.

[00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:58.450]
So it's a big secret, then?

[00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:00.270]
Yeah, it's a big secret.

[00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:04.670]
So give me a new Xbox 360 there.

[00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:05.290]
What?

[00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:06.990]
Do it while it's held.

[00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:08.390]
Don't make me angry.

[00:55:08.830 --> 00:55:09.850]
He will want me.

[00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:11.750]
I'll be right back.

[00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:12.510]
Hey, Eurogist, you okay?

[00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:13.530]
What are you saying, girl?

[00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:16.950]
Hey, Rod, TickTacks.

[00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:19.270]
You're all burning beds with the facts.

[00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:20.890]
Hey, Rod, TickTacks.

[00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:24.370]
Available now from a guy in the locker room of your local gym.

[00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:26.190]
But don't tell anybody.

[00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:27.710]
You don't do any work.

[00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:28.270]
Yeah.

[00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:32.050]
Oh, that sounded like the...

[00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:32.950]
Thank you, you've worked hard.

[00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:35.790]
Like a little frugno, didn't it?

[00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:39.190]
Actually, I never watched that, you know.

[00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:40.230]
It was awful.

[00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:41.090]
You didn't miss anything.

[00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:41.690]
Was it really?

[00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:42.330]
I believe that.

[00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:43.730]
And what was his name?

[00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:45.230]
My favorite Martian was in it.

[00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.530]
Wasn't it?

[00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:46.310]
He did Bill Bixby?

[00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.650]
Yes.

[00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:47.550]
Was he?

[00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:47.910]
Yes.

[00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:49.250]
And what was his...

[00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:51.870]
Was he the guy before he got like all bulked up?

[00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:52.330]
That's him.

[00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:53.390]
Wow.

[00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:55.210]
So how do I know that?

[00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:57.710]
I guess I must have watched it once.

[00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:59.570]
And that was enough for me.

[00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:00.690]
That's one of the comics, or...

[00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:01.590]
More than heard about it.

[00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:03.330]
Like listening to some of those sports shows.

[00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:05.110]
Like listening to Drusenstein crants.

[00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.890]
I'm going to tell you something.

[00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.130]
There needs to be a major investigation

[00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:10.050]
with all these people where their salary is being cut.

[00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:13.210]
And what people get blown out like the great Ken Walden.

[00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:19.210]
There needs to be an investigation and find out what the story is on the payroll

[00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:22.250]
of these idiots who are destroying our ratings and killing our audience

[00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:23.650]
are still getting paid.

[00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:25.850]
You found what I'm saying?

[00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:26.350]
Yeah.

[00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:27.950]
This would be an infomity.

[00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:31.450]
This would be scandalous to find out that the Alex Marvezes

[00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:34.510]
and Drusenstein's of the world are getting paid

[00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:36.150]
while everybody else is getting a pay cut.

[00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:40.950]
That would be totally, absolutely,

[00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:42.650]
positively unacceptable.

[00:56:44.570 --> 00:56:46.870]
In fact, I think if you find that out...

[00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:49.330]
You and all the other people taking that 5% pay cut,

[00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:50.870]
I think you all ought to walk out.

[00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:52.690]
Or phones ringing, I'll be right back.

[00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.590]
Take your time.

[00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:54.330]
I'll play Hulk music.

[00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.690]
Music

[00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:16.770]
Dr. David Banner, decision scientist,

[00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:20.810]
searching for a way to tap into the hidden strengths that all humans have.

[00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:23.930]
Ben and Axe and Metal Overdose of Gamma Radiation.

[00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:26.130]
The Asmettus, if he's trying to drum up business,

[00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:27.910]
you do for Clingin' March.

[00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:28.910]
Well, March of what year?

[00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:29.810]
Go-go-way, bitch.

[00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.310]
God!

[00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:34.530]
We're going to be getting more and more of this.

[00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:35.730]
This business gets worse and worse.

[00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:37.370]
You're going to be getting more telemarketing crap.

[00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:38.810]
The phone's going to be ringing off the hook.

[00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:40.090]
I would just take the phone off.

[00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:42.030]
Off the hook and just throw it out the window.

[00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.550]
Smash it.

[00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:44.110]
Bash it.

[00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.770]
Oh, hello.

[00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:46.630]
I never, never, never.

[00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:47.850]
That's my rich friend, Rick's office.

[00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:48.890]
I'm busy.

[00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:49.690]
I'm busy.

[00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:50.270]
I'm busy.

[00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:52.030]
God.

[00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:54.170]
Now, what the hell were you just playing?

[00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:57.530]
The intro of the Hulk, the Accredible Hulk.

[00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:58.050]
Oh, really?

[00:57:58.330 --> 00:57:58.410]
Yeah.

[00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:00.490]
I heard it was a horrible show.

[00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:01.330]
It was a horrible show.

[00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:03.450]
You picking on Lou Farrignore again?

[00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.630]
Not him personally.

[00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:05.430]
Was it his fault?

[00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:09.710]
Okay, now let's see what this says.

[00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:12.470]
Oh, this is the second time they said this.

[00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:15.330]
And it just is illiterate and misspelled as it was the first time.

[00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:19.230]
I just bought a soltus and heading to woodbine misspelled.

[00:58:19.650 --> 00:58:20.610]
Both words misspelled.

[00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:26.070]
Hey, yeah, hey, hey, moron, imbecil.

[00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:29.530]
Just bought a soltus and heading to wood.

[00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:31.350]
B-Y-N-E, woodbine.

[00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.930]
I see.

[00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:38.210]
Jose says, didn't hear what Ruth Christie were talking about,

[00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:39.430]
but the one of the Gables is great.

[00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:42.530]
While the one 160 thirds of me went downhill in the last 18 months

[00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:43.150]
it was in business.

[00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:46.850]
I'm assuming it's on a business no more based on what Jose said.

[00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:50.910]
I wasn't talking about either one of those because I never ate it either one of those.

[00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:52.350]
I was talking about the 104 Lauderdale,

[00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:58.030]
which the last two trips there had extremely unsatisfying experiences.

[00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:02.450]
On a totally different tack, I can't tell how proud I am of our president.

[00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:06.550]
So nice to have a set of sentences drawn together without a hint of hesitation

[00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:08.790]
that we got forever with that dry drunk.

[00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:12.890]
Please see the attachment included that shows what the GOP is looking for

[00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:15.050]
cause that Jindelga would make Cheney look like a saint

[00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:17.130]
since he's a fundamentalist version of a tale of the Hun.

[00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:20.550]
Please check the attachment and I did not and will not.

[00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:22.730]
Sorry Jose, thanks.

[00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:24.890]
Please check the attachment.

[00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:28.530]
What part of I don't open attachments and don't do links?

[00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:30.430]
What part of that don't they understand?

[00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:32.030]
I guess none of it.

[00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:36.790]
I mean, haven't I said that very emphatically and very clearly and very...

[00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:38.790]
maybe not enough.

[00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.610]
Owloud?

[00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:42.190]
Owloud?

[00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:43.610]
Oh, sorry.

[00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:45.590]
Owloud!

[00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:48.610]
Bill Dreck, what was his name?

[00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:51.870]
Bill Tuck, he was a tech-dreck.

[00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:57.030]
That was just such a mishmash of crap.

[00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:00.290]
Whammy, oh that was quite an experience.

[01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:01.650]
Thanks a lot Marvin, you idiot.

[01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:02.810]
There's now there's idiot.

[01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:06.110]
Whammy, got it, fucks.

[01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:08.370]
That's one of George's buddies, by the way.

[01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:08.610]
Right.

[01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:09.750]
Is he?

[01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:11.050]
We hang out every day.

[01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:13.530]
Do you have one last time you've seen Marvin Rawman?

[01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:14.930]
I don't know the number of years.

[01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:18.670]
Maybe he's not that son of a b-foward, aren't they like Cheney together with the hip?

[01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.370]
You know, they kind of like Julie Brimman and John McKayden.

[01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:23.490]
They had that association but I don't think they're friends anymore.

[01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.790]
Really?

[01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:26.470]
After that incident.

[01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:28.830]
After that engine thing?

[01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:29.250]
Yeah.

[01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:31.110]
A engine business.

[01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:34.350]
I wonder if that engine business anything you would Bobby Jindall?

[01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:34.350]

[01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:35.550]
I'm John Killa.

[01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:36.090]
Different.

[01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:36.490]
I wonder.

[01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:38.930]
Here's Mary Ossos.

[01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:41.170]
I was sitting last night watching Obama addressing Congress.

[01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.950]
He was sitting.

[01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:42.870]
I'm glad he weren't standing.

[01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:47.230]
Although he did get a lot of standing ovation, especially from that simple and nancy Pelosi.

[01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:47.750]
Oh.

[01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:50.470]
And the thing with him.

[01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:57.310]
She and your vice president Joe Biden were sitting behind Obama since he didn't watch any of it.

[01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:57.870]
Yeah.

[01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:02.650]
And she was like ready to jump up out of the chair every time he said like two words.

[01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:07.250]
And on the other hand, everybody was standing and Biden all of a sudden like I don't know what he was reading.

[01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:10.890]
Maybe the maybe he was reading the racing from a Dover Downs, the racing program.

[01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.790]
I don't know what he was reading.

[01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:17.190]
But then all of a sudden like his and after that he would jump up and start applauding.

[01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:18.930]
And like he wasn't paying any attention at all.

[01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:20.970]
Maybe he was getting ready to put those asses on his forehead.

[01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:23.970]
Now as you go around.

[01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:26.910]
I'm going to check that today.

[01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:28.250]
Check what?

[01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:31.450]
Oh, I guarantee you my cab guy is going to have his asses on today.

[01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:33.490]
If he ended on on Monday or Tuesday, yes.

[01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.110]
He had the old ass on the forehead.

[01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.790]
Really?

[01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:39.670]
Yeah.

[01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:43.110]
Tell me about how he went to church on Sunday.

[01:01:43.690 --> 01:01:44.890]
Now how long do you keep that on there?

[01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:46.890]
Do you keep it on to the whole 40 days and 40 nights?

[01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:47.450]
All through length?

[01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:49.030]
I don't know.

[01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:51.690]
I think just the day until you take your next shower.

[01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:56.930]
Just for a day, you'll want a second opinion from a Catholic.

[01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:01.630]
Mary Osses, I was sitting last night watching Obama addressing Congress.

[01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:03.450]
Couldn't help myself to think out loud.

[01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:04.630]
Wow, how do you like that?

[01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:10.350]
Wow, a presidential figure on TV, a well-educated man who can obviously read and write,

[01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:12.650]
who is capable of putting more than two sentences together,

[01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:15.730]
who can actually make sense when he speaks with a real message to the nation.

[01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:18.330]
It sounds like he gives an F about this beautiful country in its citizens.

[01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:21.130]
Sorry if I'm sounding a little bit excited about Obama.

[01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:26.850]
It's just that it's been eight painful and barricingly years watching a clown with a southern accent.

[01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:30.290]
Pretend to be a president and trying beyond his capabilities to speak English

[01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:33.530]
and deliver messages that until this day, we're trying to decipher such as,

[01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:36.990]
fool me one shame on me, fool me twice, shame on, can't get fooled again.

[01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:39.250]
Love the show, keep up the great work, Mary Osses.

[01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:40.690]
Well, thanks, Mary Osses. You can sit down now.

[01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:43.730]
He was sitting on here.

[01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:53.390]
Here's a picture of Obama with a, I don't know if it's supposed to be a wig,

[01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:54.630]
but like black hair, you know?

[01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:55.730]
Oh, no, like a pro?

[01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:58.130]
No, not a pro, not a pro, the opposite.

[01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:01.750]
Like Bobby Jindall here.

[01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:06.650]
Oh, anyway, it's amazing, but it's not the radio, you know?

[01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:09.030]
Oh, put it on your site and you'll put it on here.

[01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:12.630]
Put this. Don't let me forget one of these days we're going to redo that website

[01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:13.650]
and like stream it all out.

[01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:14.010]
All right.

[01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:17.270]
Sounds like a little bit too much like work to me though.

[01:03:18.070 --> 01:03:21.450]
Then maybe we'll get those 80 billion hits on there like they do across the street.

[01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:22.950]
You know that they're all screaming about.

[01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:26.210]
Oh, we got four trillion hits on their website on the George Sedano.

[01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.570]
Yeah.

[01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:28.970]
You, you, you only wish.

[01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:33.630]
Like I said, told you before and I'll keep telling you time and time again.

[01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:36.330]
You can't talk yourself into having an audience.

[01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:37.470]
Either you got one or you don't.

[01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:40.250]
What if you do a lot like talk a lot and really loud?

[01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.610]
Yeah, that helps.

[01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:44.350]
Especially if you do it out loud.

[01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:51.190]
Oh, brother.

[01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:53.210]
I'm trying to think back to those.

[01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:56.070]
No, no, I don't understand since we they take the show.

[01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:59.730]
In the studio down on the second floor there, Q.A.M.

[01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:01.130]
How did we interact with him?

[01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:02.110]
How did we ever meet him?

[01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:03.130]
Did we ever meet him?

[01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:05.670]
Yeah, he came in once or twice.

[01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:06.190]
Did he really?

[01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:06.890]
I think he did.

[01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:11.190]
With that fat farting Joe guy.

[01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:13.070]
Well, he was the camera crew build.

[01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:14.530]
Tech had nothing to do with.

[01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:17.610]
I know that particular crew, but he was a fat farting guy.

[01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:19.450]
But I think he came in and said hi like, you know,

[01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:20.890]
a few other people on that channel did.

[01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:22.210]
Did really say hi?

[01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:22.470]
Sure.

[01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:26.650]
And nothing.

[01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.910]
Gourmet's tell nice guy, big fat ears, whatever.

[01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:29.930]
The show is all built up.

[01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:30.410]
Build a tech?

[01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:30.670]

[01:04:31.090 --> 01:04:32.890]
Yeah, I think I've seen that show once.

[01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:33.110]
Right?

[01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:34.970]
And the one thing about that show, you could hear the audio.

[01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:35.750]
One like my show.

[01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:36.070]
Right.

[01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:38.390]
I say show very loosely.

[01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:42.370]
All right, for the largest one, the one.

[01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:43.490]
And that was good.

[01:04:44.090 --> 01:04:45.650]
Thanks for getting me involved in that, by the way.

[01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:46.690]
Oh, you're welcome.

[01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.010]
Although it was free money.

[01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:50.370]
We weren't paying very much, but whatever was it was free money.

[01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:53.870]
So I'll put that in the envelope when I overnighted to a chicken neck.

[01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:54.230]
Good.

[01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:56.590]
Neil Rogers.

[01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:57.830]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:04:58.210 --> 01:05:02.190]
This is Sean Dolonis, former editor of the prestigious New York Post.

[01:05:02.810 --> 01:05:05.090]
I'd like to personally apologize about the car

[01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:07.530]
at the one that the two cops gunned down the monkey.

[01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:13.130]
We here at the New York Post in no way encourage the assassination of your president.

[01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:14.630]
Yeah, I mean the president.

[01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:18.710]
All of us here at the New York Post, we ain't got nothing against college.

[01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:21.050]
Your college are all right by us.

[01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:25.190]
I mean, we tolerate less watching it or weren't born pristine and white.

[01:05:25.650 --> 01:05:30.170]
Or here in the office, we provide college with their very own bedroom and water fountain.

[01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:34.090]
And a none at the moment might act as taken matters into his old hands

[01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:37.930]
by replacing me with the new editor, Le Javias World Junior.

[01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:42.110]
And just recently hired for the entertainment section, Johnny Wilkes Booth.

[01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:43.770]
So no offense, how you doing?

[01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:47.870]
We're doing this 1131 and I'm still not over nighting anything to anybody.

[01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:51.490]
I prefer the regular snail mail.

[01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:53.490]
Works like a charm every time.

[01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:55.470]
You know what I mean?

[01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:56.970]
No, it's played a tip.

[01:05:57.050 --> 01:06:02.050]
And doesn't cost 30 bucks to send out during these difficult, these trying times and days we've had.

[01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:03.490]
That's right.

[01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:06.250]
How's the doubt doing by the way, Fatso?

[01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:07.050]
Let me take a look.

[01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:11.670]
Forget about CNN because they put it way down.

[01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:14.670]
You can't even read it with a, oh, the doubt is down 131.

[01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:16.370]
Well, not as bad as it was.

[01:06:17.790 --> 01:06:20.750]
Not good, but it's not as bad as it was.

[01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:22.350]
We're not giving it back all the yesterdays games.

[01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:24.050]
And that is down to about 24 points.

[01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:24.790]
Any interest?

[01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:25.130]
No.

[01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:26.190]
Not if you're smart.

[01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:28.850]
Not if you're smart.

[01:06:29.010 --> 01:06:30.690]
A fool in his money or soon farted, man.

[01:06:30.930 --> 01:06:31.830]
Trust me when I tell you.

[01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:34.370]
The hardware realities of our situation right now.

[01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:35.370]
I think you did a good job.

[01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:38.970]
I think that in order to get the stimulus package passed,

[01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:43.370]
he had to give the doubt warning and the consequences of not acting.

[01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:48.430]
Well, there's that boring Harry Reid standing there looking like he just farted real bad and he's pretty embarrassed about it.

[01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.210]
And you know what he probably didn't.

[01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:50.930]
He probably is.

[01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:53.250]
Max says, wait till you hear this.

[01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:54.710]
Hi.

[01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:57.830]
See, this is what I don't understand about people in general.

[01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:04.150]
Speaking of Nancy and Obama's speech, every time she got up and sat down, her breasts kept jiggling.

[01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:05.990]
She must have at least a deep cup.

[01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:09.010]
I know George noticed you probably not hope I didn't ruin your lunch.

[01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:10.850]
Baboom, da boom says Max.

[01:07:11.050 --> 01:07:13.370]
Well, first of all, George didn't watch it.

[01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:13.650]
Right.

[01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:19.670]
But the most important thing is why would anybody care about Nancy Pelosi's breasts?

[01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.790]
Right?

[01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:24.390]
And I have toured it many, many, many, many times.

[01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:28.430]
And it's true with heterosexual people and homo-sexual people.

[01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:30.470]
But the size queen, right?

[01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:31.190]
Body parts.

[01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:32.470]
Body parts.

[01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:34.430]
It doesn't make any difference what they're attached to.

[01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:36.410]
It's like the John Holmes syndrome, you know?

[01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:36.870]
Right.

[01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:39.750]
He was carrying around like a fire hose.

[01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:41.570]
But look what it was attached to.

[01:07:41.570 --> 01:07:42.030]
Faa.

[01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:49.290]
And so like anybody that's looking at Nancy Pelosi's jiggling breasts really needs a serious help.

[01:07:49.850 --> 01:07:50.050]
Serious.

[01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:50.730]
I have no life.

[01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:52.170]
Max, you can have my portion.

[01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:53.810]
Baboom, baboom, yeah.

[01:07:55.290 --> 01:07:57.870]
God, she is a beast.

[01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:03.070]
Not our beast, but she's nasty.

[01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:04.290]
She's grotesque.

[01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:06.670]
Well, let's see.

[01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:07.190]
Here it is.

[01:08:07.290 --> 01:08:08.410]
Neal, glad that you're back.

[01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:13.230]
Didn't get to listen to most of the day's show, but briefly heard something about how I sent George negative emails.

[01:08:13.850 --> 01:08:14.890]
Oh, this is John's ETR.

[01:08:15.010 --> 01:08:15.830]
Didn't get to this yesterday.

[01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:18.250]
What?

[01:08:18.670 --> 01:08:19.730]
Oh, nothing else for you.

[01:08:19.730 --> 01:08:20.830]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:22.230]
Sounded to me like you were in pain.

[01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:25.590]
We better get those emails cranked up because now I'm getting back in the yesterday's leftovers.

[01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:27.970]
That means they're sure as hell laying the lot left in this file.

[01:08:29.530 --> 01:08:30.910]
Neal at nealrodges.com.

[01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:32.010]
Let's crank them up a little bit.

[01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:33.650]
Okay, let's get something going here.

[01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:35.330]
Off to Lasas.

[01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:39.350]
I heard something about how I sent George negative emails.

[01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.830]
Yeah, that's not what I'm saying.

[01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:42.010]
Please tell George that fake our email.

[01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:44.070]
Listen, I'm going to read it just the way he wrote it.

[01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:48.570]
Please tell George that fake our emails are fake.

[01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:51.730]
Okay, figure out what that means.

[01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:52.430]
I don't know what that means.

[01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:53.570]
I'll look it up on you.

[01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:55.810]
They're intended to get a rise out of someone to be funny or kill time.

[01:08:56.230 --> 01:08:59.310]
Please tell George that because he takes the emails way too seriously.

[01:08:59.570 --> 01:08:59.830]
Oh, yeah.

[01:09:00.730 --> 01:09:01.670]
Keeps me up at night.

[01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:02.950]
I have nothing against George.

[01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:06.090]
In fact, I was a big fan but that they when he blasted me, I was distraught.

[01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:09.410]
I got home and ripped off all my George posters off the wall.

[01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:15.350]
George is fantasy that I'm some fat pasty guy who sits around his wrong.

[01:09:15.610 --> 01:09:19.670]
I listen mostly at work and the emails despite what George thinks take like two minutes to send.

[01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:22.370]
And I'm not Josh Friedman or any radio person.

[01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:24.270]
Says John ZTR.

[01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:29.190]
Who now is obviously morphed into rooster cogburn or whatever the hell he's doing now.

[01:09:29.710 --> 01:09:33.570]
Who started out attacking me and the showing though it ain't what he used to be about.

[01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:35.270]
And now all of a sudden is attacking you.

[01:09:35.610 --> 01:09:36.370]
John ZTR.

[01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:38.050]
He's boring by any name.

[01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:38.830]
Exactly.

[01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:39.710]
Terminal.

[01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:40.390]
Pondress.

[01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:42.010]
Not as pondress though is it did.

[01:09:42.170 --> 01:09:45.830]
Did Winston Churchill fill in for you at IOD one day and all like that.

[01:09:47.530 --> 01:09:47.930]
God.

[01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:52.890]
What is this one glad you're back.

[01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:54.230]
I like George but he is not you.

[01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:56.770]
What do they feel compelled to keep saying that?

[01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:58.470]
Well, that says it all right there.

[01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:59.910]
Yeah, well, we know that.

[01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:01.210]
Everybody else feel it wouldn't be.

[01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:02.450]
Well, it's not you.

[01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:04.270]
Well, that's why I'm getting paid the big bucks.

[01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:09.530]
Anyway, I was flying out of John Wayne, California airport yesterday morning back to Florida.

[01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:15.830]
While waiting to board a very loud siren suddenly went off and TSA thugs in Orange County Police came running into the terminal screaming.

[01:10:16.090 --> 01:10:16.910]
Stop walking.

[01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.670]
Stop walking.

[01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:22.630]
Most of us were caught off guard and kept walking when the SS closed in forcing people to stop.

[01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:26.030]
Everyone was terrified, which I'm sure was their intention.

[01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:28.390]
Suddenly they turned and walked away without an explanation.

[01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:29.570]
So why we were terrorized.

[01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:30.470]
Get me out of here.

[01:10:33.150 --> 01:10:34.150]
Now it is that.

[01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:35.710]
Well, I mean, what was that?

[01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:36.470]
I don't know.

[01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:38.530]
He said a bunch of crap.

[01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:41.310]
Was it illuminating?

[01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:42.030]
No.

[01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:42.750]
Was it interesting?

[01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:43.070]
No.

[01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:45.070]
Did we find out what that was all about?

[01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:45.290]
No.

[01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.630]
No.

[01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:47.330]
Is it interesting at all to anybody?

[01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.610]
No.

[01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:53.230]
But he certainly had the time to sit down and send a pile of crap.

[01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:57.530]
KC says, oh, this is good.

[01:10:59.070 --> 01:11:00.050]
Real shot at you.

[01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:00.970]
Yeah, I doubt it.

[01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:10.750]
I don't know if you were kidding, but if you think that 46% of the listeners who indicated that they don't listen to any Georgia shows are liars as you stated you were living in a fantasy world.

[01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:12.010]
That's me.

[01:11:12.130 --> 01:11:13.430]
I live in a dream world, baby.

[01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.850]
I'm not going to say George sucks, even if that's what I think.

[01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:18.430]
But only that he is no Neorodra.

[01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:19.410]
See, there we go again.

[01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:22.090]
I listen to your show for you.

[01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:22.650]
Well, guess what?

[01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:27.850]
I'm not working 52 weeks a year, seven days a week, every 24 hours a day, just to make you happy.

[01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:28.990]
KC or anybody else.

[01:11:30.170 --> 01:11:31.990]
It is what it is and the press is right.

[01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.810]
If you like it, fine.

[01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:33.830]
If not, bye-bye.

[01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:35.730]
Very simple, not complicated.

[01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:39.070]
If and when George takes over, I will not listen.

[01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:40.470]
I listen to music on those days.

[01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:42.350]
Apparently about half your listeners feel the same.

[01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:48.430]
Why would think anyone who enjoys listening to you must also enjoy listening to him?

[01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:49.590]
He cannot replace you.

[01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:53.890]
And when did I say anyone who enjoys me would advise verse of the same thing?

[01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:58.410]
George has got people who enjoy him because he's under the age of a hundred and who hate me like poison.

[01:11:58.990 --> 01:12:00.390]
And that's just the way it is.

[01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:03.930]
But like I said, these are professional deenters.

[01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:06.390]
Oh, this one said this and that one said that.

[01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:07.730]
And bye-bye-bye, Frankie Pantangel.

[01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:09.530]
Yeah, sure.

[01:12:09.730 --> 01:12:11.410]
God, get a freaking life already.

[01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:12.070]
I have no life.

[01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:13.110]
God.

[01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:17.010]
I'll tell you one thing, though, you steer them up.

[01:12:17.730 --> 01:12:18.790]
Yeah, with a spoon.

[01:12:18.930 --> 01:12:21.170]
Yeah, as Joe Rose would say, you steer it up.

[01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:25.770]
What does he say that?

[01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:26.810]
I'm stirring it up.

[01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:27.310]
I tell you.

[01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.370]
I don't know.

[01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:28.350]
Maybe it's a jock talk.

[01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:31.930]
Is it jock talk or is it like, you know, I kind of talk.

[01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:32.010]
No, I don't.

[01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:32.230]
You answered that.

[01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:33.330]
What?

[01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:33.990]
Jock talk.

[01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:35.230]
No, I don't.

[01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:36.450]
You didn't take a class?

[01:12:36.850 --> 01:12:37.650]
No, I did not.

[01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:42.750]
Oh, by the way, Paco went to see the Raptor game last night with some of Buddy of his.

[01:12:42.850 --> 01:12:45.390]
I don't know with whom or what, but he said he enjoyed and they won.

[01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:47.430]
The Raptors.

[01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:54.350]
Oh, Lawrence, you know, Lawrence already sent me one long ponderous thing about the speech last night.

[01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:57.210]
And now he sent it and they know, Obama isn't really black.

[01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:59.550]
It's stick and George is really a Bible.

[01:12:59.550 --> 01:13:02.790]
He's born again, non-Hispanic man and he'll be a really woman.

[01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:03.950]
Well, that's for Lawrence.

[01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:06.330]
Lawrence, just listen to the show and enjoy it.

[01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:08.250]
Okay, stop feeling compelled to send me crap.

[01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:12.330]
He always seemed like a bright guy, like a human being.

[01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:17.430]
And now he's just degenerated to another guy to just fills up a couple of sentences on a page, you know?

[01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:24.150]
And I realize I'm big and for emails here because we're down to like a precious, very, very precious small pile here.

[01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:27.470]
I may have to play poker face for two hours.

[01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:28.030]
Poverty?

[01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:28.530]
Poverty.

[01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:28.530]

[01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:32.390]
Lady Gaga, you better get with it.

[01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:35.490]
Not only weren't you watching Nancy Pelosi and her jiggling breast last night.

[01:13:37.690 --> 01:13:39.950]
Maybe you could explain that to me, that whole phenomenon.

[01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:42.510]
You know, you nailed it.

[01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:44.070]
Body parts, so to speak.

[01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:49.790]
There are men who are only into the size of that gigantic breast and other men who are in pieces.

[01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:50.090]
Right.

[01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:51.950]
Like just some body body.

[01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:55.910]
I think I'd had sent me the thing yesterday about the Indian guys with the other condoms.

[01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:57.390]
It was an interesting story.

[01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:59.190]
They don't measure up.

[01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:00.710]
But what do I care about that?

[01:14:02.090 --> 01:14:02.410]
I don't know.

[01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:03.770]
I don't.

[01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:06.090]
I don't.

[01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:09.310]
In addition to which you might ever going to see that guy's goods is junk.

[01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.770]
No.

[01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:12.890]
So what events is it make?

[01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:14.390]
I don't know.

[01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:15.610]
I can dream.

[01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:16.270]
Can't I?

[01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:16.790]
Who did that?

[01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:17.670]
They require sisters?

[01:14:18.330 --> 01:14:18.630]
No.

[01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:19.450]
Some sisters.

[01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:20.490]
The Andrew sisters.

[01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:24.470]
Boy, you got to be really, really old.

[01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:25.990]
Remember the Brian Andrew sisters.

[01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.490]
Oh, no.

[01:14:26.850 --> 01:14:27.770]
Still got.

[01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:29.430]
Remember.

[01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:33.890]
Remember when we played met mouth.

[01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:34.430]
Yeah.

[01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:36.870]
Dems with a salad toss in days.

[01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:39.050]
Like the time you root my face, Joe.

[01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:41.330]
Hello, everybody.

[01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:42.370]
Welcome to the premiere.

[01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:43.990]
A more famous show.

[01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:45.510]
Poor delightful.

[01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:49.850]
I was open to payment and information to help you get through your busy day-to-day.

[01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:53.590]
Actually, you know, yeah, I'm just going to talk about sports here.

[01:14:54.710 --> 01:14:55.590]
Here's the scores.

[01:14:55.930 --> 01:14:57.770]
Seven or two, seven or three.

[01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:58.770]
How about the dolphins?

[01:14:59.170 --> 01:14:59.670]
Blah, blah, blah.

[01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:02.470]
Hey, what do you have to walk through here in the middle of my show?

[01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:05.150]
I was looked at for the NFL Concubine.

[01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:07.370]
What are you thinking walking through my show?

[01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:10.470]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I like this and the background.

[01:15:10.770 --> 01:15:12.010]
What the f*** is it with you?

[01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:14.090]
That kind of language is going to get you right.

[01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:15.710]
Do you know who I am?

[01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:19.290]
I'm bold, David-edited, and that's f*** the straitings.

[01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.470]
See?

[01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:21.670]
Haven't someone walked through the middle of my show?

[01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:23.930]
Give me a f*** an answer.

[01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:24.950]
I don't understand.

[01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:27.290]
What don't you understand, David-edited?

[01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:29.850]
I just don't know why we need another sports show.

[01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:34.430]
I mean, what else can you say that there's only so much to talk about, you know?

[01:15:35.050 --> 01:15:36.250]
Oh, and buy the way something.

[01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:39.530]
I hit that last piece of pizza pie in the back room there.

[01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:42.250]
Oh, good for you.

[01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:43.250]
Thank you.

[01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:45.170]
It was tasty, too.

[01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:45.770]
Yeah.

[01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:48.150]
Was my name on the f*** box?

[01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:50.590]
Yes, and right there, most pizza.

[01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:52.310]
Get out of my studio, Bub.

[01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:54.790]
All right, let's get this show back on track.

[01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:56.370]
Can I just take a second here?

[01:15:56.650 --> 01:15:57.570]
I'll give you a second.

[01:15:57.570 --> 01:16:02.790]
I'll give you two seconds, and you better use them to get the hell out of here.

[01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:04.350]
I don't understand why they're like that.

[01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:08.610]
You don't understand what it's like working with professional broadcasters.

[01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:09.350]
Is that it?

[01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:14.090]
Well, they're calling yourself a broadcaster, but you're not really a broad.

[01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:15.790]
Everyone's about to get it.

[01:16:15.850 --> 01:16:16.230]
Enjoy it.

[01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:18.130]
Thanks for ruining my show.

[01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:19.430]
I enjoyed it.

[01:16:19.570 --> 01:16:20.930]
Why don't you turn it a little bit?

[01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:32.310]
And I still don't like you.

[01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:32.910]
Oh, yeah?

[01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:34.550]
Then why you're spooning me?

[01:16:36.610 --> 01:16:37.530]
Yes, spoonness.

[01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:40.350]
1146, 14-doll-new, and a QM.

[01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:41.050]
Did I give the schedule?

[01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:41.770]
I don't think so.

[01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:44.530]
Now that it's all that big of a deal, it's pretty much the regular to do it twice.

[01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:47.710]
They go two to four, mad dog four to seven, in-house.

[01:16:48.730 --> 01:16:49.570]
What is it?

[01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:52.250]
Oh, Dolphin tonight, seven away, then Hurricane Hotline 8 to 9.

[01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:52.850]
Oh, wow.

[01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:56.190]
And then the D.A. show 9 to 9 to midnight.

[01:16:57.770 --> 01:17:02.590]
As he tries to follow Dolphin tonight and Hurricane Hotline, wow, just keep in mind.

[01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:04.850]
You bet.

[01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:08.090]
Paul Castronova, the fake one, of course, says,

[01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:09.950]
Georgia is fine off the air.

[01:17:10.170 --> 01:17:11.250]
He is a bore on the air.

[01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:12.590]
Have you know him?

[01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.710]
Who?

[01:17:14.410 --> 01:17:15.190]
Paul Castronova.

[01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.830]
Not him once.

[01:17:16.450 --> 01:17:18.090]
Years ago, at an appearance of yours.

[01:17:19.050 --> 01:17:19.510]
Really?

[01:17:19.890 --> 01:17:20.030]
Yeah.

[01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:23.010]
I would D.D.

[01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:25.430]
I believe so, yeah.

[01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:27.850]
Maybe that was the week that Meg Greenfield on, I'm I show.

[01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:29.130]
People that are record stores, something.

[01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.790]
Not the doubt.

[01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.770]
He's a bore on the air.

[01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:33.270]
He shows us for young punks who don't listen to AM radio.

[01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:35.770]
He would fill in on Power 96, regards Paul.

[01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:38.450]
Subject, George Sucks.

[01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:39.550]
How do you like that?

[01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:41.970]
How do I call?

[01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:43.130]
I have no but taking a shot.

[01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:44.050]
I don't like that.

[01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:44.670]
I don't like that.

[01:17:44.670 --> 01:17:47.090]
That's what the emails have degenerated into now.

[01:17:47.710 --> 01:17:51.690]
Is that George isn't Neil and George Sucks or or whatever.

[01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:52.630]
My head's so old.

[01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:53.470]
There's some variation on that thing.

[01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:54.890]
Steve came cronies over there.

[01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:56.010]
YAH YAH YAH.

[01:17:57.610 --> 01:18:01.130]
See you keep hallucinating and imagining that you know who's sending these.

[01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:03.970]
There's a Zidian people out there in the vacant city.

[01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:04.130]
Right.

[01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:06.750]
And I know that the people on the phone, you know what?

[01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:06.850]

[01:18:07.210 --> 01:18:10.190]
I have found a new avenue and they're going to eight.

[01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:11.890]
They're going crazy and great for them.

[01:18:14.230 --> 01:18:14.710]
Yeah.

[01:18:14.710 --> 01:18:17.490]
Well, it looks to me like we're going to have to be taking calls noon to two.

[01:18:18.230 --> 01:18:18.550]
Great.

[01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:19.270]
Whatever.

[01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:20.230]
Great.

[01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:20.850]
Do it.

[01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:23.110]
Well, they're sure it's not new emails coming in.

[01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:23.810]
Double-dog Daria.

[01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:25.410]
Wow.

[01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:27.830]
Double-dog Daria, what?

[01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:28.770]
Take some calls.

[01:18:29.010 --> 01:18:30.230]
Either that or spin some wax.

[01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:30.710]
Sure.

[01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:31.530]
Read some stories.

[01:18:32.530 --> 01:18:33.870]
Read some stories.

[01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:35.130]
You think I'm going back to that?

[01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.870]
Although I do have one.

[01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:38.050]
And you know what it's about?

[01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:39.990]
I don't know. That's peach.

[01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:43.930]
No, it's about Jackson's star in Nigeria Resort Row.

[01:18:43.930 --> 01:18:49.730]
Now, remember you were talking about how suds brought that up or somebody asked about it?

[01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:51.350]
That slave land.

[01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:51.970]
Slave thing.

[01:18:52.190 --> 01:18:52.190]

[01:18:52.230 --> 01:18:52.850]
I got the story.

[01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:53.630]
Excellent.

[01:18:53.890 --> 01:18:55.130]
From BBC News No Less.

[01:18:55.450 --> 01:18:56.790]
So it might actually be accurate.

[01:18:58.090 --> 01:18:58.870]
It might be an accurate.

[01:18:59.070 --> 01:18:59.570]
Oh, it's a bit of that.

[01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:00.230]
How's the poll doing?

[01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:05.270]
497 votes.

[01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:06.310]
That's pretty impressive.

[01:19:08.530 --> 01:19:12.870]
Not like George Sedano with his 45 million votes that they get on every poll they take over there.

[01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:13.750]
Oh, my God.

[01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:16.370]
There are things just gets blown right out.

[01:19:17.090 --> 01:19:18.430]
When it outflow it out.

[01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:19.230]
Yeah, they're thing.

[01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:25.490]
The definitive chick car of all time is Volkswagen Cabriolet 140.

[01:19:25.890 --> 01:19:26.990]
A lot of VWs on here.

[01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:28.730]
VW Beetle 111.

[01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:30.270]
If it was good enough for what's his name?

[01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:31.870]
Ted Bundy.

[01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:34.410]
Ted Bundy, yeah.

[01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:38.390]
That's how we got caught with that damn Beetle.

[01:19:39.770 --> 01:19:41.410]
Mazda Miyada 103.

[01:19:41.650 --> 01:19:44.150]
The Miyada Pontiac Fioro 30.

[01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:47.590]
Boy, it is a big just those top three and then after that it's nothing.

[01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:51.390]
VW Jetta 25 Mitsubishi Eclipse 23.

[01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:54.330]
Toyota Prius 13 Dodge Neon 12.

[01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:55.910]
And after that it's small potatoes.

[01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:57.330]
Nothing.

[01:19:57.810 --> 01:19:58.910]
So just those top three.

[01:19:59.010 --> 01:20:01.270]
The Cabriolet, the Beetle and the Mazda Miyada.

[01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:03.390]
Nobody voted for the solstice.

[01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:04.670]
That's good.

[01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:07.410]
Are you cracking your knuckles again?

[01:20:07.410 --> 01:20:08.170]
I heard your ed.

[01:20:08.530 --> 01:20:09.710]
I heard it with my own ear.

[01:20:11.290 --> 01:20:13.730]
There's one thing that's really annoying and that's ear wax.

[01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:16.910]
And you know what I never think to buy?

[01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.950]
Qtips.

[01:20:18.650 --> 01:20:19.090]
Qtips.

[01:20:19.210 --> 01:20:19.830]
I will wear it.

[01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:24.470]
In Vancouver last weekend in a hotel, boy I'll say that's a beautiful hotel.

[01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:28.950]
They had in the bathroom they had among other things, Qtips.

[01:20:29.150 --> 01:20:29.310]
Really?

[01:20:30.490 --> 01:20:32.630]
And I just did a beautiful job.

[01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.930]
It's fine.

[01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:35.890]
It's not good to do with your finger with your little finger.

[01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:39.590]
Oh, you're supposed to Qtip like every day I do that.

[01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:42.130]
You Qtip every day.

[01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:43.190]
Every day.

[01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:45.530]
I think you've got to finish.

[01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.670]
Oh yeah, sure.

[01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:49.090]
Who on earth right now?

[01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:50.310]
I'm Qtips every day.

[01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:52.090]
That's like people who floss every day.

[01:20:52.150 --> 01:20:53.330]
Now we're all supposed to do that.

[01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:56.830]
And every time I get my teeth cleaned they give me like a little thing of dental floss.

[01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:57.510]
Not very much.

[01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:59.690]
When I get out of the shower, I mean you like water in your ear?

[01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:01.130]
I mean for no other reason.

[01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:02.590]
I don't have water in my ear.

[01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:04.970]
Well after I take a shower I took a Qtip in there every day.

[01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:05.910]
Yeah.

[01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:06.690]
So I don't have any.

[01:21:06.730 --> 01:21:07.090]
You're wack.

[01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:09.150]
Probably after you take a dump you stick one in your...

[01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:09.490]
Wreck them.

[01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:10.530]
Just to make sure.

[01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:10.930]
What a great idea.

[01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:13.050]
Did they make them any bigger than those little ones?

[01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:15.590]
How about an A-tip?

[01:21:15.970 --> 01:21:17.290]
We got the Qtip for the ear.

[01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:18.130]
Yeah.

[01:21:18.210 --> 01:21:19.390]
What about that means Qtip?

[01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:20.830]
You never stop thinking about that?

[01:21:21.230 --> 01:21:21.950]
Some quippy.

[01:21:22.570 --> 01:21:24.570]
I'm sure there's a story behind it, but I don't know what it is.

[01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.830]
Maybe Queer.

[01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:28.610]
Maybe.

[01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:29.970]
Hey you Queer.

[01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.470]
Queer tip.

[01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.770]
Yeah, Queer tip.

[01:21:32.730 --> 01:21:33.310]
There you go.

[01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:34.850]
See George uses queer tips.

[01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:36.270]
Mm-hmm.

[01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:39.170]
Yeah.

[01:21:39.370 --> 01:21:40.390]
They're obsessed with you.

[01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:43.670]
I mean if we didn't have a bunch of emails about you we wouldn't have anything.

[01:21:43.930 --> 01:21:44.450]
Apparently not.

[01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:47.970]
I mean we'd have like maybe 1% of what we get.

[01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:50.270]
If they weren't for the 99% about George.

[01:21:50.410 --> 01:21:51.970]
Gilbert's hate me for hanging up on them.

[01:21:52.150 --> 01:21:53.050]
Gilbert's the thing.

[01:21:53.290 --> 01:21:54.370]
I got Gilbert involved.

[01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.910]
It's the King crew.

[01:21:56.170 --> 01:21:56.690]
It's the Gilbert.

[01:21:56.890 --> 01:21:57.730]
He gets everybody.

[01:21:58.070 --> 01:22:00.030]
It might as well be just one person.

[01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:01.090]
Oh my God.

[01:22:01.090 --> 01:22:04.290]
I mean if gay Ted is a chiming in now let's see what gay Ted says.

[01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:11.190]
When would you come to your senses and admit that nobody likes George's show?

[01:22:11.530 --> 01:22:12.870]
Oh gay Ted, a new character.

[01:22:14.170 --> 01:22:15.250]
Okay, let me print it out.

[01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:16.410]
I'm sure you'll enjoy hearing it.

[01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.590]
Yeah.

[01:22:17.190 --> 01:22:18.210]
In its entirety.

[01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:21.430]
If it'll ever print this.

[01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:23.810]
Outlook express.

[01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:25.490]
It's not what you were crack it up to me.

[01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.630]
I never.

[01:22:27.690 --> 01:22:28.390]
Never what?

[01:22:29.170 --> 01:22:30.530]
It's the worst female client.

[01:22:30.610 --> 01:22:31.890]
I try to get you to use a different one.

[01:22:32.010 --> 01:22:34.090]
You couldn't figure out how to configure it.

[01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:35.930]
No you couldn't get me to do it right.

[01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:36.190]
Yeah.

[01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:37.870]
You couldn't give the right direction.

[01:22:37.930 --> 01:22:38.410]
Oh that's right.

[01:22:38.530 --> 01:22:38.970]
Blame me.

[01:22:39.190 --> 01:22:40.290]
I'm a decrepit old fart.

[01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:42.090]
And I don't know how to do the internet.

[01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:43.570]
I was doing it along with you.

[01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:45.050]
And you weren't following instructions.

[01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:46.030]
You're full of crap.

[01:22:46.930 --> 01:22:47.550]
Didn't work.

[01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.950]
Sandy Frazier.

[01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:55.310]
PR.com.

[01:22:55.530 --> 01:22:56.410]
Obama's beautiful rhetoric.

[01:22:56.410 --> 01:22:57.630]
It's a column by somebody.

[01:22:57.770 --> 01:22:58.310]
I don't want that.

[01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:59.850]
I don't want somebody's columns.

[01:22:59.870 --> 01:23:01.070]
What's wrong with you people?

[01:23:02.570 --> 01:23:04.090]
I mean the effort that it takes.

[01:23:04.210 --> 01:23:06.230]
They could be they could be using the q-tip.

[01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:07.150]
Clean out their ears.

[01:23:09.670 --> 01:23:11.190]
Oh my god says Walt.

[01:23:11.410 --> 01:23:13.010]
PT cruiser would seem to belong on there.

[01:23:13.210 --> 01:23:15.050]
Actually that would seem to be for middle age females.

[01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:16.710]
They don't necessarily qualify as chicks.

[01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:17.890]
PT cruiser.

[01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:18.470]
What is that?

[01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:20.630]
To get suggestion is what it is.

[01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:21.570]
Is it?

[01:23:21.810 --> 01:23:22.010]
Yeah.

[01:23:22.510 --> 01:23:23.430]
Well put it on there then.

[01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:27.570]
We already got 501 votes but get it on.

[01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:32.250]
All right here's the latest rip job on poor George.

[01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:34.930]
Ted says.

[01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.850]
Hello Neil.

[01:23:36.130 --> 01:23:38.550]
When would you come to your senses admit that nobody likes Georgia's show?

[01:23:38.670 --> 01:23:39.210]
Oh gay Ted.

[01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:41.470]
You say you don't listen to what say.

[01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:44.970]
So can you say if it's good or not good?

[01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:47.850]
It's fine because it fills the time when I'm not here.

[01:23:48.530 --> 01:23:50.990]
And we do just fine in the numbers and the summertime we do great.

[01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:52.310]
So that's all I care about.

[01:23:53.850 --> 01:23:56.890]
Please tell me who wants to listen to stories about George going roller skating,

[01:23:57.230 --> 01:23:59.530]
taking sign language classes or smoking pot.

[01:23:59.890 --> 01:24:00.530]
Nobody cares.

[01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:04.810]
And nobody cares about the music George likes or what movies he thinks are good.

[01:24:05.210 --> 01:24:07.610]
The second I tune into your show and hear that George is on instead of you,

[01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:09.310]
I immediately change the channel.

[01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:13.530]
I refuse to listen to George would prefer to hear the best of Neil Roger.

[01:24:13.670 --> 01:24:15.510]
Oh this is from Joe Bell.

[01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:19.190]
Would prefer to hear the best of Neil Roger's show instead.

[01:24:19.190 --> 01:24:20.350]
He likes the tapes.

[01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:24.310]
I would prefer to hear the best of Moe show as opposed to George.

[01:24:24.670 --> 01:24:25.970]
There is no best of Moe.

[01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:29.190]
Why are you in such denial about Georgia's show being awful?

[01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:30.870]
It's time to wake up and make a change.

[01:24:31.050 --> 01:24:33.470]
Fire George now says gay Ted.

[01:24:34.590 --> 01:24:35.330]
Fire him now.

[01:24:36.850 --> 01:24:37.330]
No.

[01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:40.430]
How do you like that?

[01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:44.810]
That's something I'm just wondering is all this stalker obsession is.

[01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:46.830]
I can't remember ever being as bored.

[01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:50.210]
You did that.

[01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:51.310]
That's just that.

[01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:52.990]
That is the river hockey shows.

[01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:54.170]
The why?

[01:24:54.450 --> 01:24:55.130]
The river hockey.

[01:24:55.210 --> 01:24:57.710]
No, it's not in the same category with the river hockey shows.

[01:24:58.030 --> 01:24:59.350]
There was nothing you read about that.

[01:24:59.610 --> 01:25:00.970]
And you allowed me to do them.

[01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:02.710]
It's a miracle.

[01:25:02.710 --> 01:25:03.630]
I was like being here.

[01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:05.870]
Thank God I don't hear from that with any more of that rumor.

[01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:09.610]
Time for a hockey show, a hockey show.

[01:25:09.610 --> 01:25:14.130]
This is a guy between his stock advice and his show advice.

[01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:15.750]
Practically putting me out of business.

[01:25:16.730 --> 01:25:19.350]
Financially and whatever else.

[01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:22.690]
And never apologize for it.

[01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:24.130]
Apologize.

[01:25:24.270 --> 01:25:24.850]
He kept talking.

[01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:25.930]
He kept talking to hockey.

[01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:27.310]
What are we going to do in another hockey show?

[01:25:27.450 --> 01:25:28.410]
What are we going to do in the hockey show?

[01:25:29.690 --> 01:25:30.390]
How about tomorrow?

[01:25:31.150 --> 01:25:33.110]
When the North Pole freezes back over.

[01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:34.510]
Oh, yes.

[01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:39.430]
Where are it needed 12 to 1 hour on WQA?

[01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:06.390]
I say that any job is worth to win.

[01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:09.510]
So I'll take when I can get.

[01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:12.730]
Pop up the floor and make it worth the rest of the look.

[01:26:12.850 --> 01:26:14.450]
And those newspaper ads.

[01:26:15.210 --> 01:26:18.810]
Too bad I ain't seen nothing yet.

[01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:22.230]
Baby, I ain't seen no job yet.

[01:26:22.770 --> 01:26:25.890]
That's one, that's one layoff I won't forget.

[01:26:26.970 --> 01:26:30.210]
Baby, I ain't seen no job yet.

[01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:32.630]
There ain't no job to row.

[01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:36.650]
12-1 at 560 WQ.

[01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:38.490]
I'm happy Wednesday unless you're unemployed,

[01:26:38.650 --> 01:26:40.310]
unless you're S-O-L, unless you got known.

[01:26:40.710 --> 01:26:41.830]
And if you're off to Laxas.

[01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:44.310]
Good luck to you.

[01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:46.110]
We wish you all a luck in the world.

[01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:49.450]
In the meantime, why do you sit around on your ass,

[01:26:49.670 --> 01:26:51.270]
send us an email and tell us how George sucks.

[01:26:51.490 --> 01:26:52.610]
You know, something creative like that.

[01:26:53.670 --> 01:26:54.010]
Right?

[01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.810]
Why not?

[01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:56.310]
Marsha says,

[01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:58.030]
Hi, Uncle Neil.

[01:26:58.030 --> 01:26:59.210]
I'm worried you're going to trash me,

[01:26:59.330 --> 01:27:00.770]
which is why I never contacted you.

[01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:03.190]
I'm a dark, conflicted 30-year-old,

[01:27:03.190 --> 01:27:03.430]
uh,

[01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:06.130]
rural, that's a needle fan,

[01:27:06.330 --> 01:27:07.650]
probably brown-usual, but I love it.

[01:27:08.150 --> 01:27:10.390]
Anyway, my boyfriend turned me on to you about three years ago,

[01:27:10.710 --> 01:27:11.630]
and ever since I've been hooked.

[01:27:12.630 --> 01:27:14.590]
Of course, your political views have had a lot to do with that.

[01:27:14.850 --> 01:27:17.370]
And I must say, your religious views have opened my eyes a little.

[01:27:17.610 --> 01:27:19.650]
You know us dark folks are very lured friendly,

[01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:21.330]
especially when everything else fails.

[01:27:23.290 --> 01:27:25.150]
When all else fails, turn to the Lord.

[01:27:25.150 --> 01:27:26.290]
Well said, Marsha.

[01:27:27.670 --> 01:27:28.590]
Or thought Marsha.

[01:27:28.630 --> 01:27:29.230]
It's in Maisha.

[01:27:30.150 --> 01:27:30.790]
Oh, Maisha.

[01:27:30.930 --> 01:27:31.310]
Oh, Maisha.

[01:27:31.630 --> 01:27:31.950]
Oh.

[01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:33.230]
And at the end, she tells me how to pronounce it.

[01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.490]
Maisha.

[01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:35.250]
Kind of a name is that.

[01:27:35.810 --> 01:27:36.130]
Dole does.

[01:27:36.150 --> 01:27:36.750]
I still have faith,

[01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:39.310]
but I think my intelligence is doing as best to take care of that too.

[01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:42.630]
Anyway, I was so proud last night I cried on many occasions.

[01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:44.390]
Also, I love to fake emails.

[01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.950]
Unlike George,

[01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:46.230]
I love when you engage with them.

[01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:48.450]
It's so funny to me, especially Jimmy Cifalus.

[01:27:50.410 --> 01:27:51.630]
And here comes the good part.

[01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:54.030]
And now the morning is over.

[01:27:54.030 --> 01:27:55.990]
It's afternoon so I can be as fat as I want.

[01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:57.930]
Especially when pressed those two idiots.

[01:27:58.290 --> 01:27:59.770]
Oh, I think it's all a big act.

[01:27:59.830 --> 01:28:00.290]
Yeah, right.

[01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:02.410]
Keep it in the time zone now.

[01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:04.850]
No, no, the guy said,

[01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:07.170]
you talk about, it's too much to handle all morning.

[01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:08.330]
Oh, don't you remember?

[01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.790]
That's right.

[01:28:09.090 --> 01:28:09.450]
Forgot.

[01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:10.470]
Rooster Cogburn.

[01:28:11.230 --> 01:28:13.030]
Neal, what do you think about Cristiano Ronaldo?

[01:28:13.210 --> 01:28:15.350]
He's my ultimate hot, hot, hot, amen, sweetheart.

[01:28:16.570 --> 01:28:17.590]
Maisha's got good taste.

[01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:19.190]
George, you're cute too.

[01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:20.310]
Oh, like I said, you did have.

[01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:22.210]
Love your picture on the website.

[01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:23.290]
Love you, Maisha.

[01:28:23.290 --> 01:28:26.290]
When I think of Cristiano Ronaldo, I always think of George.

[01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:27.230]
That's right.

[01:28:28.190 --> 01:28:29.750]
Like two peas in a pot.

[01:28:29.890 --> 01:28:31.410]
He is a beautiful man.

[01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:32.510]
Cristiano, I'm not sure.

[01:28:33.650 --> 01:28:34.730]
He is gorgeous.

[01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:36.450]
He is to die for.

[01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:38.950]
He is to squeeze and please.

[01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:40.610]
Right around the knees.

[01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:41.470]
Anyway,

[01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:44.410]
chronic Jason says, don't they get it?

[01:28:44.650 --> 01:28:45.390]
Don't they get it?

[01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:47.350]
Don't they get what?

[01:28:48.630 --> 01:28:49.450]
Oh, I see.

[01:28:50.230 --> 01:28:51.870]
Neal, does Joe Bell have joys for brains?

[01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:52.230]
Yes.

[01:28:52.230 --> 01:28:53.510]
As a matter of fact,

[01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:59.150]
Dan LaBassard is killing you guys in the afternoon with his fun and non-sports intensive show.

[01:28:59.470 --> 01:29:02.150]
Yeah, and what does Joe put on here?

[01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:04.970]
A special two-hour show on Miami Huracun's basketball.

[01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:06.490]
Talk about narrow casting.

[01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:10.150]
Also, I sent George the info, but maybe you're interested in,

[01:29:10.150 --> 01:29:12.090]
know there's a huge bluegrass festival this week in Hollywood.

[01:29:12.330 --> 01:29:12.690]
No, I'm not.

[01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:14.430]
You care about it?

[01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.670]
No.

[01:29:16.410 --> 01:29:19.010]
Hollywood's where the nude beaches, boobs, boobs and bluegrass.

[01:29:19.230 --> 01:29:19.450]
Yahoo!

[01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:20.850]
Hope to see you there, Jason.

[01:29:20.850 --> 01:29:23.670]
No chance in anybody's pants.

[01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:25.290]
Bluegrass festival.

[01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:27.250]
And all over nude beach.

[01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:28.330]
Oh my god.

[01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:29.630]
You talk about gruesome people.

[01:29:29.710 --> 01:29:30.610]
I've been there.

[01:29:30.650 --> 01:29:31.850]
Uh oh.

[01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:33.430]
And what do you think?

[01:29:34.210 --> 01:29:34.430]
Gross.

[01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:40.970]
Gross guys standing around naked with binoculars looking at other gross people standing around with binoculars.

[01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:42.750]
Looking back at you.

[01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:44.710]
But nevertheless,

[01:29:45.730 --> 01:29:49.330]
Jason doesn't have the rich for life that we thought he did.

[01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:52.850]
Maybe he can get some tips from gay tech.

[01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.730]
Maybe he does well there.

[01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:55.430]
I was speaking of tips cotton swabs.

[01:29:57.790 --> 01:29:58.190]
Yeah.

[01:29:58.290 --> 01:29:59.830]
See this is a damn educational show.

[01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:03.790]
I mean, well, you think on the Jimmy Cifulla show you're going to find out about cotton swabs?

[01:30:04.010 --> 01:30:04.530]
What about them?

[01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:12.910]
British cotton buds consist of a small one of cotton wrapped around either one or both ends of a small rod.

[01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:15.930]
Usually made of either wood, rolled paper or plastic.

[01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:23.550]
They are commonly used in a variety of applications, including first aid, cosmetics application for cleaning and arts and crafts.

[01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:26.390]
Arts and crafts?

[01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:27.450]
Yeah.

[01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:30.070]
Why would you use cute tips for arts and crafts?

[01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:32.210]
Have you ever done arts and crafts?

[01:30:33.570 --> 01:30:34.650]
I don't even know what that is.

[01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:38.430]
Like making little things like paintings, make the touchies, yeah.

[01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:39.450]
And touchies, things like that.

[01:30:39.570 --> 01:30:45.590]
Use them to apply glue, substitute paintbrush, to wipe stuff off, access glue, things like that.

[01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:46.970]
A million in one use, isn't it?

[01:30:47.150 --> 01:30:48.130]
Wait until you hear this.

[01:30:49.670 --> 01:30:52.510]
The cotton swabs was invented by Leo Gerson Stang.

[01:30:53.790 --> 01:30:58.710]
Gerson Stang, in the 1920s, was invented by the product after attaching wads of cotton to toothpicks.

[01:30:59.070 --> 01:31:02.430]
His product, which he named...

[01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:03.610]
Cute tip.

[01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.870]
Baby gays.

[01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.630]
What?

[01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:07.350]
Baby gays.

[01:31:07.690 --> 01:31:08.010]
Okay.

[01:31:08.010 --> 01:31:10.970]
When I became the most widely sold brand name, cute tip.

[01:31:11.050 --> 01:31:15.490]
The term cute tip is often used as a brand name for any cotton swab, a brand nomer.

[01:31:15.890 --> 01:31:16.030]
Right.

[01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:18.030]
Oh, there is a Bobby Gindall.

[01:31:18.190 --> 01:31:18.550]
He's weird.

[01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:19.630]
You're worried about losing your cotton.

[01:31:19.630 --> 01:31:19.970]
Hey, wait a minute.

[01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:21.110]
And your home's.

[01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:22.650]
Why? Don't stop now.

[01:31:22.730 --> 01:31:24.410]
Are they getting into a Y, it's called the cute tip?

[01:31:25.090 --> 01:31:26.130]
Yeah, I'll get to it.

[01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:26.590]
Oh, man.

[01:31:26.590 --> 01:31:27.550]
We got a long way to go.

[01:31:27.670 --> 01:31:28.090]
Are you relaxed?

[01:31:28.290 --> 01:31:28.550]
No.

[01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:29.190]
The patients.

[01:31:30.730 --> 01:31:32.710]
God, they just have Bobby Gindall on there.

[01:31:32.710 --> 01:31:34.810]
He looks like Bella Legosi with a...

[01:31:35.650 --> 01:31:38.030]
with a bad case of something.

[01:31:38.770 --> 01:31:42.510]
The word cute tip means quality tip, with tip referring to the cotton tips at the end of the stick.

[01:31:42.970 --> 01:31:43.610]
Quality tip.

[01:31:43.770 --> 01:31:45.850]
The cute originally referred to quilted.

[01:31:46.690 --> 01:31:47.870]
A quilted tip.

[01:31:49.650 --> 01:31:54.530]
So if you put some cotton on your tip, you can have a quilted tip or maybe a quality tip.

[01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:59.850]
They're sometimes referred to by the British engines in South Africans as ear buds,

[01:31:59.850 --> 01:32:04.770]
and also are known as ear diggers, cotton wool buds, or ear sticks.

[01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:06.390]
Oh, ear diggers.

[01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:06.570]
See?

[01:32:06.930 --> 01:32:07.790]
Leave it to me to open up.

[01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:10.350]
Oh, there's a Joe Biden again with the schmutz on his forehead.

[01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:12.490]
Hey, somebody go tell him to wash off his forehead.

[01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:13.530]
He's got schmutz on it.

[01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:16.330]
As when's they my ass?

[01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:17.870]
What is wrong with people?

[01:32:18.370 --> 01:32:19.870]
See, this is the one thing about religions.

[01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:22.870]
They can tell people to do any kind of crap and they'll do it.

[01:32:23.650 --> 01:32:23.970]
Anything.

[01:32:24.330 --> 01:32:24.930]
What a great scam.

[01:32:25.370 --> 01:32:26.070]
Drink the cool aid.

[01:32:26.150 --> 01:32:27.590]
You know, put the ashes on your forehead.

[01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:32.210]
Wrap the scissors around your arm so that you cut off the circulation and you nearly die.

[01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:34.850]
Give us money before you can have sex.

[01:32:35.130 --> 01:32:35.610]
That's right.

[01:32:35.770 --> 01:32:37.070]
Give us money before you do anything.

[01:32:38.230 --> 01:32:40.010]
Before you spend it on something worthwhile.

[01:32:40.230 --> 01:32:42.170]
Give us all your money, honey.

[01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:46.030]
Quality tip and quilted tip.

[01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:47.150]
Ear buds.

[01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:48.610]
I feel like.

[01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:49.130]
Ear buds.

[01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:50.650]
So much more lightened now.

[01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:51.370]
British engines.

[01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:53.430]
I better talk to my Indian friend about the ear buds.

[01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:56.830]
Can I look in your ear bud?

[01:32:59.590 --> 01:33:01.010]
Not rear buds, earbuds.

[01:33:02.290 --> 01:33:03.590]
We're kicking ass on that pole.

[01:33:03.770 --> 01:33:04.250]
I don't know why.

[01:33:05.230 --> 01:33:05.930]
They likes it.

[01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:07.650]
525 votes.

[01:33:07.730 --> 01:33:09.950]
We're going to do over 600 votes today on a new pole.

[01:33:10.930 --> 01:33:12.650]
That is really awesome.

[01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:15.310]
Almost as good as a high emish mendrick over there.

[01:33:15.570 --> 01:33:16.050]
What's his name?

[01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:17.310]
Stu Gotts.

[01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:17.590]
Oh.

[01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:21.550]
Neil, do you want to do a story on this?

[01:33:22.210 --> 01:33:24.330]
Speak like Barack Obama now you can do it.

[01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:25.910]
No, I don't want to do a story on that.

[01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:29.410]
I don't want to do a story on anything.

[01:33:29.790 --> 01:33:30.370]
Send me something.

[01:33:31.230 --> 01:33:32.310]
Oh, don't tell me.

[01:33:32.410 --> 01:33:32.610]
Harry.

[01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:35.150]
Harry about George and your absence.

[01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.590]
Okay.

[01:33:35.690 --> 01:33:36.930]
Now maybe this is a positive.

[01:33:37.730 --> 01:33:38.130]
Maybe?

[01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.830]
Yeah.

[01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:40.110]
This is a positive.

[01:33:40.370 --> 01:33:42.170]
Some strokes for George.

[01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:44.570]
Let me, uh, let me get ready.

[01:33:44.810 --> 01:33:47.790]
Some props for the old, uh, goofball.

[01:33:48.570 --> 01:33:50.350]
But this, this outlook is precious.

[01:33:50.630 --> 01:33:53.350]
Stinks because you click on print.

[01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:56.030]
And it just takes its time.

[01:33:56.170 --> 01:33:57.010]
It's there we go.

[01:33:57.250 --> 01:33:57.910]
There we go.

[01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:59.390]
And then finally little box comes down.

[01:33:59.530 --> 01:34:00.110]
Selection print.

[01:34:00.330 --> 01:34:00.970]
And there we go.

[01:34:02.210 --> 01:34:04.490]
But it just, it's got the things.

[01:34:04.890 --> 01:34:05.450]
Oh, here you go.

[01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:07.130]
Paul Castron over your mama.

[01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:09.410]
You still play your mama.

[01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:11.070]
I remember this from the W and Z days.

[01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.590]
Paul.

[01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.910]
Thanks for listening.

[01:34:13.090 --> 01:34:14.610]
Paul, you might learn something that I doubted.

[01:34:15.190 --> 01:34:15.930]
Your mama.

[01:34:19.450 --> 01:34:20.210]
Your mama.

[01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:22.090]
Yeah, he used to play that.

[01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:24.290]
But what is it?

[01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:26.730]
Uh, it's not in mind anymore.

[01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:27.090]
It might be.

[01:34:27.090 --> 01:34:28.010]
Oh, we don't have it anymore.

[01:34:28.290 --> 01:34:28.770]
Your mama.

[01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.690]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:30.310]
I said, your mama.

[01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:32.570]
Remember that probably probably something filthy.

[01:34:33.210 --> 01:34:34.350]
No, that's all it says.

[01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:38.470]
Total Carl says, I'm sure most chronics like me would agree.

[01:34:38.610 --> 01:34:41.210]
George is great with you on the year and is a board off.

[01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:43.510]
The truth be told, you're in a league by yourself.

[01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:46.550]
Nobody can fill your doughnut cushion.

[01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:48.950]
Oh, your doughnut cushion.

[01:34:49.230 --> 01:34:49.510]
Oh, you're.

[01:34:51.610 --> 01:34:52.610]
Oh, you're.

[01:34:54.890 --> 01:34:55.630]
Remember now?

[01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.670]
Oh, yeah.

[01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:57.430]
Where'd you find that?

[01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:58.470]
In the computer.

[01:34:58.710 --> 01:35:02.050]
I obviously reported it and saved it before it got erased out of the DCS.

[01:35:03.290 --> 01:35:06.750]
Remember that accident we had, that DCS accident that I had?

[01:35:06.970 --> 01:35:07.270]
Your mama.

[01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:12.030]
Your mama.

[01:35:12.030 --> 01:35:12.690]
I remember you.

[01:35:12.850 --> 01:35:13.590]
I played this.

[01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:15.990]
Here's the fake Mark Hocken from across the street.

[01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:23.710]
See the one thing we can never lose George because otherwise then I won't have any more emails.

[01:35:25.110 --> 01:35:32.070]
Let's see what the fake Mark Hocken, Hocken, where in Michigan, China from across the street says about George that I was pulled and his numbers as if.

[01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:33.810]
Are you concerned about that?

[01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.870]
Am I?

[01:35:35.290 --> 01:35:36.410]
Oh, they get so many votes.

[01:35:36.650 --> 01:35:37.090]
I was in their poll.

[01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:39.070]
There'll be need of my notes.

[01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:41.490]
Not just the same people voting over and over again, including them.

[01:35:41.770 --> 01:35:48.650]
Harry says just to let you know, contrary to the George haters in your absence, George is a fantastic job.

[01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:51.370]
His conversation is fresh and interesting.

[01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:53.130]
Last week he did a great job.

[01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:55.270]
Very entertaining on a variety of subjects.

[01:35:56.170 --> 01:36:00.210]
Lots of labs and much better audience participation since he cuts off the chronicles before he gets started.

[01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:02.510]
That's the same guy that said what we yesterday about these.

[01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:04.270]
Much better audience participation.

[01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:04.630]
Uh-oh.

[01:36:04.710 --> 01:36:05.590]
You got a text message.

[01:36:05.690 --> 01:36:07.170]
No, it's a Viagra.

[01:36:08.410 --> 01:36:09.510]
It sounds like.

[01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:16.450]
They made this maybe why they hate him so much in their emails since he won't let them get the airtime that they're dying to have.

[01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:20.390]
Unfortunately, they found a way to get around that by you reading their boring George bashing emails.

[01:36:20.670 --> 01:36:22.630]
Why don't you stop reading their George bashing emails?

[01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:23.950]
See what type of thing I'm up with next.

[01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:27.990]
Maybe they will commit suicide since Harry and the S.I.B.

[01:36:28.410 --> 01:36:28.590]
No.

[01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:30.470]
They'll go back to the same.

[01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:31.230]
This is the same Harry there was.

[01:36:31.450 --> 01:36:32.350]
And don't worry about it Harry.

[01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:33.630]
It's a show. It's a radio show.

[01:36:34.130 --> 01:36:35.030]
You get paid the same.

[01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:36.870]
It tells a lot of good time for us.

[01:36:37.670 --> 01:36:43.530]
So you actually were sucking in by that Viagra email I just got her that that's what it is.

[01:36:43.670 --> 01:36:44.170]
Maybe it was soft.

[01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:45.630]
See Alice or super.

[01:36:45.630 --> 01:36:46.190]
I had it.

[01:36:46.330 --> 01:36:49.010]
It was from Betty Johnson and as soon as I read about her Johnson.

[01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:51.710]
I don't know if he had one but that was the end for me.

[01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:52.610]
Delete delete.

[01:36:53.690 --> 01:36:56.910]
Okay, here's the fake Mark Hockman from over at the cross the street.

[01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:59.250]
Neil, welcome back.

[01:36:59.430 --> 01:37:01.330]
I heard you want to know about synonymous pull for yesterday.

[01:37:01.410 --> 01:37:02.030]
No, I did not.

[01:37:02.770 --> 01:37:07.270]
I've attached the poll with the count on synonymous pull for yesterday.

[01:37:08.150 --> 01:37:09.210]
Rating's day is coming soon.

[01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:11.530]
You'll surely be the subject conversation here that day.

[01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:12.490]
I'm off on Friday.

[01:37:12.650 --> 01:37:15.450]
I stay in the end of the beach so I may head down to Gulfstream on Friday.

[01:37:15.970 --> 01:37:17.190]
Yeah, maybe he'll come and see it.

[01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:19.330]
You've been doing a great job with your picks.

[01:37:19.330 --> 01:37:20.290]
I may follow your lead.

[01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:22.510]
I'm giving you the inside total.

[01:37:22.630 --> 01:37:24.010]
Don't believe the numbers listed on the website.

[01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:25.190]
There is no total.

[01:37:28.650 --> 01:37:29.710]
Sedano pull of the day.

[01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:31.330]
What's the most painful movie scene?

[01:37:31.630 --> 01:37:32.790]
The sledgehammer scene in misery.

[01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:34.810]
Frank's and bean scene and something about Mary.

[01:37:34.890 --> 01:37:35.770]
The only two listed here.

[01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:37.050]
And the sledgehammer scene one.

[01:37:37.150 --> 01:37:37.710]
And that's it.

[01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:39.610]
I don't see any numbers.

[01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:43.010]
I don't see any poll numbers there.

[01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:44.570]
Mark fake mark.

[01:37:46.230 --> 01:37:47.170]
Ain't it embarrassing?

[01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:47.450]
It would.

[01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:53.830]
Oh, you're getting a lot of stuff.

[01:37:54.530 --> 01:37:54.970]
Great.

[01:37:54.970 --> 01:37:55.790]
Thank God for George.

[01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:56.530]
It's all I can say.

[01:37:56.610 --> 01:37:59.330]
Otherwise I'd be sitting here taking a bunch of stupid ass calls.

[01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:02.010]
And that's not going to happen anytime soon.

[01:38:02.230 --> 01:38:03.310]
I don't see any numbers on here.

[01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:04.470]
Mark fake mark mark.

[01:38:04.690 --> 01:38:05.010]
Mark Ark out.

[01:38:05.090 --> 01:38:05.790]
Birdie or whatever.

[01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:08.250]
Didn't we discover that other people don't display the numbers?

[01:38:08.970 --> 01:38:10.650]
They just do percentages or something.

[01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:11.290]
Right.

[01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:12.730]
Is that not the case over there as well?

[01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:13.590]
I don't know.

[01:38:13.650 --> 01:38:14.090]
I don't care.

[01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:14.390]
Really.

[01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:15.230]
When you come right down to it.

[01:38:16.410 --> 01:38:18.110]
I don't care about George Sedano.

[01:38:18.190 --> 01:38:18.930]
I don't care about Sedano.

[01:38:19.210 --> 01:38:19.530]
Supermarket.

[01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:21.790]
I don't care about if they had 80 trillion votes on the pool.

[01:38:21.790 --> 01:38:25.090]
And by the way that pool is the most painful movie scene.

[01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:27.090]
How about what's the most painful radio show?

[01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:27.950]
Mark.

[01:38:29.110 --> 01:38:30.670]
Howard David's a bitch.

[01:38:31.810 --> 01:38:33.610]
I am your give inch.

[01:38:33.930 --> 01:38:37.610]
You may have wondered what kind of sausage is floating in the pink juice jar at the mini mark.

[01:38:38.010 --> 01:38:40.870]
Well, they're a byproduct of transgender reassignment surgery.

[01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:42.090]
Quite tasty.

[01:38:43.330 --> 01:38:44.650]
And good for you.

[01:38:45.770 --> 01:38:48.350]
Uh, ever say nuts hanging on the back of a truck.

[01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:53.570]
What you don't know is truck lusts are also a byproduct of transgender reassignment surgery.

[01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:54.870]
Just show you what to do this.

[01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.910]
Yes, Mommy.

[01:38:56.290 --> 01:38:58.130]
Yeah, I want to look more like they're woman.

[01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.450]
Okay.

[01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:00.410]
Both still.

[01:39:01.230 --> 01:39:01.830]
You're here.

[01:39:02.410 --> 01:39:02.830]
Whoa.

[01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:03.790]

[01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:04.490]

[01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.870]

[01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:06.950]
What do you want to do with these?

[01:39:07.090 --> 01:39:09.370]
Uh, just hanging on the back of a truck or something.

[01:39:09.570 --> 01:39:13.430]
Adore your pickup truck with dangling manhood by dangling someone else's.

[01:39:13.710 --> 01:39:16.230]
Available in brass, chrome, and blue anodized.

[01:39:16.230 --> 01:39:20.210]
Make your truck use less gas by showing your ass with peanuts.

[01:39:20.930 --> 01:39:22.190]
Oh, yeah, good old truck nuts.

[01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:23.290]
That's something I hadn't.

[01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:24.750]
I'm not sure which is more impressive.

[01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:26.090]
Who tips or truck nuts?

[01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:27.230]
Oh, there's no question.

[01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:28.630]
No content.

[01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:31.230]
I hear some of them that I have no idea what this is all about.

[01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:32.410]
Oy Shmoi Jew chronic.

[01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:35.210]
Neil speaking of the old days on FM radio.

[01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:37.450]
And I went, when were we speaking of the old days on FM radio?

[01:39:37.770 --> 01:39:38.270]
I don't remember.

[01:39:38.650 --> 01:39:40.030]
I don't need a little bit of long time ago.

[01:39:40.590 --> 01:39:42.250]
Your friend Ricky used to work for me and Miami.

[01:39:42.450 --> 01:39:43.530]
I don't even know who Ricky is.

[01:39:43.690 --> 01:39:44.830]
I have no idea who that is.

[01:39:44.830 --> 01:39:45.730]
Do you know what he's talking about?

[01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:47.810]
I only know one Ricky.

[01:39:48.370 --> 01:39:50.190]
They kid with the hats and issues there.

[01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:51.130]
Your my space friend.

[01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:52.830]
Is that not a Ricky?

[01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.310]
Jacob?

[01:39:56.930 --> 01:39:57.250]
No.

[01:39:58.850 --> 01:39:59.410]
Oh, Ricky.

[01:39:59.570 --> 01:40:00.050]
Oh, that's Ricky.

[01:40:00.190 --> 01:40:00.670]
Kim to Gulfstream.

[01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:02.210]
No, no, I'm just going to reach it over here.

[01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:03.410]
I don't know anybody else in Ricky.

[01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:03.710]
No.

[01:40:04.590 --> 01:40:05.490]
By the way, he vanished.

[01:40:05.670 --> 01:40:06.950]
Like everybody else in my space.

[01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:08.150]
That's okay.

[01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:09.410]
Finally was chasing you.

[01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:10.810]
I was chasing his girlfriend, Mighty Low.

[01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:11.330]
Remember her?

[01:40:11.550 --> 01:40:11.970]
Remember him?

[01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:13.330]
No, I do not.

[01:40:13.810 --> 01:40:14.290]
Wow.

[01:40:14.410 --> 01:40:15.770]
Never had a life it says, and then it says,

[01:40:15.770 --> 01:40:16.530]
Oh, boy.

[01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:19.870]
And this is like in, this could be like in Sanskrit.

[01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:20.650]
Sure.

[01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:24.150]
I have no idea what the light means.

[01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:27.410]
Your friend Ricky.

[01:40:27.610 --> 01:40:28.470]
I don't know Ricky.

[01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:30.810]
I didn't know no Godfather.

[01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:32.350]
Stupid.

[01:40:32.570 --> 01:40:33.710]
Stupid idiotic crap.

[01:40:33.930 --> 01:40:34.170]
Sure.

[01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:37.050]
544 votes on that poll though.

[01:40:39.610 --> 01:40:40.450]
Nothing new though.

[01:40:40.510 --> 01:40:42.870]
I just checked on your outlook express on mine.

[01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.710]
Endures.

[01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.750]
Nothing new though.

[01:40:46.810 --> 01:40:48.390]
I guess Rooster Cogburn's out of material.

[01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.850]
Oh, no, he's not.

[01:40:51.610 --> 01:40:53.550]
All this gain is the A. Year right.

[01:40:53.630 --> 01:40:54.550]
That must be the Reverend.

[01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.930]
And his boyfriend.

[01:40:58.670 --> 01:41:00.210]
They started before it was popular.

[01:41:01.810 --> 01:41:03.290]
Here's one from a D. Bar.

[01:41:05.570 --> 01:41:06.750]
It says, Hi guys.

[01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:08.170]
People are obsessed with George.

[01:41:08.810 --> 01:41:12.230]
The rare times I write in, I know I ask most of my questions about George.

[01:41:12.230 --> 01:41:15.230]
But then the more I know about him, he talks about his wife, his kids,

[01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:18.810]
juggling, rollerblading, pot smoking, religious views.

[01:41:19.050 --> 01:41:20.730]
He just gives you so much to comment on.

[01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:24.230]
I don't believe for a woman and all those people really want George gone.

[01:41:24.230 --> 01:41:26.390]
If either of you sucked so much, they just wouldn't listen.

[01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:29.430]
And here's a question for George.

[01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:31.630]
How does he manage to bong it in Florida?

[01:41:32.210 --> 01:41:34.550]
I thought they really bust you hard down there if they catch you talking.

[01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:36.250]
Also does he let his kids smoke?

[01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:37.590]
Oh my God.

[01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:38.710]
Oh, here's the answer.

[01:41:38.710 --> 01:41:42.450]
I just pretend to smoke weed like Neil pretends to be gay.

[01:41:42.710 --> 01:41:44.030]
It's just for the radio.

[01:41:44.530 --> 01:41:44.950]
Uh huh.

[01:41:45.110 --> 01:41:45.570]
I knew it.

[01:41:45.690 --> 01:41:47.070]
This is all a made up persona.

[01:41:48.170 --> 01:41:49.450]
I'm actually not in Florida.

[01:41:51.870 --> 01:41:54.590]
And this Harry Ebener, he sent the email twice.

[01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:57.930]
Maybe Harry and Sonny Ausbeach wants to elope with you.

[01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.690]
Do you think it's possible?

[01:41:59.450 --> 01:41:59.690]
Maybe.

[01:42:01.530 --> 01:42:06.030]
Oh, I just got another retest message.

[01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:07.710]
I'm sleeping.

[01:42:10.770 --> 01:42:13.510]
That's only after a new challenge if he can do text while sleeping.

[01:42:13.670 --> 01:42:16.210]
Hey, I got news for him and some people got a pretty good.

[01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:17.230]
Yeah.

[01:42:17.730 --> 01:42:19.730]
Yeah, some people got a pretty good life.

[01:42:20.730 --> 01:42:24.170]
Well, he's, you know, spent a lot of energy watching a Raptor's Game last night.

[01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:27.190]
You couldn't pay me $100 a minute.

[01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:29.530]
I wouldn't go to an NBA or any basketball game.

[01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:34.590]
I used to broadcast college basketball and high school basketball back in the day

[01:42:34.590 --> 01:42:36.790]
when I was a Jones and a sportscaster.

[01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:39.110]
I'm sure glad I didn't pursue that.

[01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:42.950]
Everybody in their brother knows the sportscaster.

[01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:45.430]
There's all, although I will say this, there are plenty of job opportunities

[01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:48.050]
since we've now got 400 sports stations.

[01:42:48.190 --> 01:42:48.590]
Where is they?

[01:42:48.810 --> 01:42:50.550]
Since today is the 25th of February.

[01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:53.210]
Where is the straight dope?

[01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:57.310]
Where is the poop on the big changes coming on 940 on March 1?

[01:42:57.430 --> 01:43:00.030]
And all these other changes that are allegedly happening.

[01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:06.710]
S. Quinn says last Friday, me and my son, me and my son.

[01:43:08.050 --> 01:43:12.010]
Hey, I mean, I don't want to be a nitpicker and I realized I'm not some kind of intellectual

[01:43:12.010 --> 01:43:14.230]
or even pseudo intellectual, but Jesus God.

[01:43:15.190 --> 01:43:17.690]
Me and my son went to the new A-Rod Park at UM.

[01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:19.290]
We sat last year behind home.

[01:43:19.630 --> 01:43:23.670]
New press boxes right behind us and I.

[01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:28.470]
Oh, the new press box is right behind us.

[01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:31.610]
I say, I'm sorry because that would be a new one on me.

[01:43:31.730 --> 01:43:36.270]
Us and I is right behind us.

[01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:38.250]
I could hear Joe S before the game started.

[01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:40.170]
No, it's Joe Z, not Joe S.

[01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:44.990]
Then I saw this thing in a UM tent waddle in and crush it chair next to Joe.

[01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:46.450]
Is this the beast?

[01:43:46.690 --> 01:43:47.010]
Wow.

[01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.890]
Yeah, that's him.

[01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:51.150]
Maybe you can tell me why Joe turns it over to the beast for the middle innings.

[01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:54.570]
So we can use this brown bag dinner at a little table in front of the press box.

[01:43:54.970 --> 01:43:56.430]
Why does Joe do the baseball games?

[01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:57.850]
They need their own voice.

[01:43:58.330 --> 01:43:59.850]
Anyway, please verify what I saw.

[01:43:59.950 --> 01:44:00.670]
Yeah, that was the beast.

[01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:06.990]
So the beast actually does play by play?

[01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:08.710]
I don't know.

[01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:11.070]
Oh, you've got to be schmittin' me.

[01:44:12.250 --> 01:44:13.430]
Ron says, Georgia's fine.

[01:44:13.570 --> 01:44:14.350]
I listen some time.

[01:44:14.610 --> 01:44:19.150]
The only reason I don't listen all the time is I'm not interested in some of the subjects, some of his subjects.

[01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:22.590]
But he sure is better on the radio than the jocks that are on your stations as Ron.

[01:44:22.950 --> 01:44:24.990]
And his ratings are better than the jocks on the station too.

[01:44:27.450 --> 01:44:29.830]
I do not know.

[01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:31.050]

[01:45:02.670 --> 01:45:02.670]

[01:45:02.670 --> 01:45:10.370]
Hear, delve, and loud lightning.

[01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:24.930]
Hear, sound light.

[01:45:24.930 --> 01:45:26.690]
And this man should be mine

[01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:33.490]
So stop the fear and the light

[01:45:33.490 --> 01:45:36.130]
This man should be mine

[01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:40.430]
See what you know for me

[01:45:41.530 --> 01:45:43.950]

See what you know for me

[01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:50.790]
So let your life be mine

[01:45:57.010 --> 01:45:58.730]
See what you know for me

[01:45:58.730 --> 01:45:58.930]
See what you know for me

[01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:03.310]
Oh, me!

[01:46:03.570 --> 01:46:04.170]
You're the single

[01:46:04.170 --> 01:46:06.470]
Sure can't hear you because it's dropping out

[01:46:06.930 --> 01:46:07.710]
Now it's back

[01:46:07.710 --> 01:46:08.710]
I can hear you fine

[01:46:09.490 --> 01:46:10.730]
It didn't drop out at all

[01:46:10.730 --> 01:46:11.190]
No

[01:46:11.190 --> 01:46:12.030]
But you did

[01:46:12.570 --> 01:46:13.470]
Sorry about that

[01:46:13.470 --> 01:46:16.370]
Got five green lights now but I'm just warning you right now

[01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:16.650]
Alright

[01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:18.810]
Somebody's patching around with something

[01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:21.610]
One of the red lights was on on the little thing

[01:46:21.610 --> 01:46:22.930]
You know the little box I'm talking about?

[01:46:23.190 --> 01:46:23.350]
Yes

[01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:24.870]
That's a five green lights

[01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:25.530]
Or do Hickey

[01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:31.410]
You probably wondered why like interjecting there in the middle of the spark as it dropped out

[01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:33.590]
Right now, five green lights

[01:46:34.730 --> 01:46:35.910]
Let's proceed

[01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:37.490]

I did that this morning

[01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:13.250]
Because it's ass-wends there

[01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:14.890]
Is it supposed to rejoice on ass-wends day?

[01:48:14.890 --> 01:48:18.070]
Oh, let us pray, blah blah blah, oh my god

[01:48:19.050 --> 01:48:22.150]
It's just, oh, now, Mark Ahak

[01:48:22.150 --> 01:48:24.570]
The fake producer of the

[01:48:24.570 --> 01:48:26.650]
Daniel Leviturg show across the street

[01:48:28.110 --> 01:48:31.250]
Sorry, bad paste and a copy of the job by me, here's the number

[01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:33.670]
The total and the pull on the set on

[01:48:33.670 --> 01:48:37.650]
This is more than his cue and probably, 11,892 votes

[01:48:37.650 --> 01:48:38.390]
Yesterday

[01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:39.750]
Wow, how long did they leave that on?

[01:48:40.530 --> 01:48:42.350]
No, it's not a question how long did they leave it on?

[01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:44.830]
On their poll, you can vote 100 times if you want

[01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:45.330]
Oh, I see

[01:48:45.790 --> 01:48:49.410]
They have one of those polls, we can just keep re-voting over and over and over

[01:48:49.410 --> 01:48:49.690]
What?

[01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:51.050]
And accurate one, in other words

[01:48:51.050 --> 01:48:51.710]
Right

[01:48:52.890 --> 01:48:54.570]
And says the number was in a menu box

[01:48:54.570 --> 01:48:57.230]
So it didn't copy out of the body of the email, it didn't copy completely, sorry

[01:48:57.230 --> 01:48:59.990]
And here's the pull, most painful movie scene

[01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:02.030]
Frankson Bean Scene in something about Mary

[01:49:02.410 --> 01:49:05.410]
Sledgehammer Scene in Misery, chest waxing from the 40-year-old Virgin

[01:49:05.410 --> 01:49:08.290]
If you could dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball, dodge ball

[01:49:08.290 --> 01:49:10.210]
The curve's down from our American history ex

[01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:12.530]
And removal of wisdom tooth with a skate castaway

[01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:15.350]
That was the pull, 11,892

[01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:16.830]
Wow, I'm impressed

[01:49:18.090 --> 01:49:18.450]
Woo!

[01:49:20.190 --> 01:49:23.670]
See, they don't care about their ratings, all they care about is how many times people will vote on their pull

[01:49:25.330 --> 01:49:26.590]
Evidently, well we could do that

[01:49:26.590 --> 01:49:28.910]
Because when it comes down to ratings, they ain't got any

[01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:30.450]
Especially at that, and that show

[01:49:31.150 --> 01:49:33.310]
We got 562 votes as all we got

[01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:35.930]
Now if we want, Eric can change that in like 50,000

[01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.730]
Or a million

[01:49:38.350 --> 01:49:41.530]
The song that promo I'm talking about goes back longer than that

[01:49:41.530 --> 01:49:45.670]
Part of the promo song went, NEO NEO NEO NEO NEO NEO

[01:49:45.670 --> 01:49:46.910]
I know we're talking about

[01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:50.890]
We're talking in early 90s, it was awesome, says the fake manny from Kendall

[01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:53.630]
Go get a life, okay, manny?

[01:49:53.970 --> 01:49:54.710]
Get lost

[01:49:55.210 --> 01:49:58.990]
Oh, Castor Nova's back, it says, I agree that Georgia's better than most of the sports holes

[01:49:58.990 --> 01:50:00.490]
But he still sucks on the year

[01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:04.970]
Are you gonna have to stand major in before he passed away into that big radio station in the sky

[01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:06.730]
Or face down on the gutter? No, I'm not

[01:50:07.870 --> 01:50:10.650]
Dave Capretta's picturing a giant monkey in the truck of his car

[01:50:10.650 --> 01:50:13.850]
Steve Stancell's a mutual friend, we're all chronic, says Paul

[01:50:15.090 --> 01:50:17.770]
And maybe Steve Stancell's sending some of this crap, I don't know

[01:50:18.290 --> 01:50:19.970]
You think you know, but we don't know

[01:50:20.530 --> 01:50:23.550]
We know John ZTR, but we don't know who John ZTR is

[01:50:24.610 --> 01:50:28.130]
See the day he allegedly came out of the closet, it was meaningless

[01:50:28.130 --> 01:50:30.070]
Because nobody knows who that is

[01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:31.590]
Right, I know what he is

[01:50:32.430 --> 01:50:34.190]
Oh no, what is that?

[01:50:34.510 --> 01:50:35.070]
One of them

[01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:38.590]
Oh, there's John McCain

[01:50:39.150 --> 01:50:40.150]
Tomorrow the next one

[01:50:40.150 --> 01:50:41.570]
Guess what John, you still lost, man

[01:50:42.570 --> 01:50:44.730]
Paul says a cute tip every day

[01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:49.910]
After night shower, you get the cute tip and while you clean your ear, you can hear your throat together

[01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:53.230]
So you can clear your throat together and release a nice feeling

[01:50:53.230 --> 01:50:53.750]
Really?

[01:50:54.890 --> 01:50:55.670]
Well, try that

[01:50:55.670 --> 01:50:59.370]
While you clean your ear, you can clear your throat together

[01:50:59.870 --> 01:51:02.250]
I see, almost orgasmic if you do it right

[01:51:02.250 --> 01:51:02.910]
I'm gonna try it

[01:51:02.910 --> 01:51:03.910]
That's supposed to stick it there

[01:51:04.590 --> 01:51:08.370]
Many people do this, I've known women and family members of the jumbo packet cute tips

[01:51:08.370 --> 01:51:09.870]
Stored in their bathrooms, man

[01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:12.650]
I have cute tips for years, I must admit I'm addicted

[01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:16.250]
Love the show, smoke one, relax your minds, is Rostapal

[01:51:16.250 --> 01:51:17.670]
The fake Rostapal

[01:51:17.670 --> 01:51:18.350]
Right

[01:51:20.050 --> 01:51:20.810]
Everybody's fake

[01:51:22.330 --> 01:51:23.130]
According to George

[01:51:23.130 --> 01:51:26.870]
Okay, let's get back to it, here's Rooster Chuchu's back, I dragged him out

[01:51:29.050 --> 01:51:30.090]
He's all over the place

[01:51:32.190 --> 01:51:36.050]
I'm still full of things for your show, but unlike George E. Boy, I do have a life and career

[01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:42.490]
I work out of different offices and move around a lot, yeah, I bet

[01:51:43.570 --> 01:51:45.630]
That's what allows me to feed him to live the life

[01:51:47.250 --> 01:51:47.970]
And what?

[01:51:48.290 --> 01:51:51.090]
To live the life I have, as well as, listen to your show

[01:51:51.090 --> 01:51:55.470]
Rooster Chuchu is not my name, by the way, it's an nickname which stands for Morning Train

[01:51:55.470 --> 01:51:57.390]
Oh, now I get it

[01:51:58.710 --> 01:52:02.290]
I will not use my real name for obvious reasons, I'm not saying anything more to little George

[01:52:02.290 --> 01:52:03.830]
His jealousy is pathetic

[01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:06.230]
Go skip your jump rope, self-hating, speak

[01:52:06.230 --> 01:52:11.470]
There you did it again, you never mentioned your lovers by name before, they were nameless and faceless

[01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:14.570]
Now all you do is Paco the Mexican did this and did that enough already

[01:52:14.570 --> 01:52:17.110]
He's not my lover and he's not whatever you think

[01:52:17.110 --> 01:52:21.610]
But go, you keep imagining, keep fantasizing

[01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:25.150]
You never mentioned your lover's by name

[01:52:28.130 --> 01:52:34.170]
Well Tom and Joe and Eddie and Stan and Sal and oh, God

[01:52:36.130 --> 01:52:40.950]
And in Zafi're new now, I can talk all I want about soccer players

[01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:42.590]
Yeah, that tells his name again

[01:52:43.150 --> 01:52:43.190]
Paley

[01:52:43.190 --> 01:52:48.050]
No, not Paley, the Spanish soccer player that Misha was so excited about, was your love him too

[01:52:48.050 --> 01:52:49.650]
I can't really get one of the sports people

[01:52:49.650 --> 01:52:51.830]
No, that might know what you're talking about

[01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:56.510]
No, alright, see that's the problem when we lost the fact Chris, although he wouldn't know either

[01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:57.930]
But soccer, no

[01:53:00.110 --> 01:53:02.770]
Christian, whatever his name is, Christian, he's a good Christian

[01:53:04.190 --> 01:53:08.250]
Christian Ronaldo, see I know I'm just old and feeble, although I'll tell you

[01:53:08.250 --> 01:53:10.730]
I wouldn't be nearly so old and feeble if he were in the room right now

[01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:12.710]
Or if Alex the Campbell was in the room

[01:53:13.150 --> 01:53:14.630]
And did you see that movie yet, siblings?

[01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:15.390]
No

[01:53:15.390 --> 01:53:19.430]
I didn't know Godfather but then again, I wonder if Godfather saw an AMC

[01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:22.290]
I don't know

[01:53:23.490 --> 01:53:27.450]
I think especially when CIA is here

[01:53:27.450 --> 01:53:30.070]
Oh, no, I won't watch him movie with him in it

[01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.890]
You know who it is?

[01:53:34.050 --> 01:53:36.470]
I don't know who it is but I won't watch him movie with him in it

[01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:37.630]
But you don't know who it is?

[01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.190]
No

[01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:40.630]
Somebody I don't like

[01:53:40.630 --> 01:53:44.010]
Oh, you don't like anybody, what is it for yesterday with Judy? What's your name?

[01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:45.610]
Joan, what is her name?

[01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.270]
Collins

[01:53:46.750 --> 01:53:48.690]
No, not Joan Collins, Judy Holiday

[01:53:48.690 --> 01:53:49.150]
Oh

[01:53:49.150 --> 01:53:50.590]
She's long since dead

[01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:51.810]
King

[01:53:53.470 --> 01:53:55.150]
Old black and white flip early 50s

[01:53:55.970 --> 01:53:59.830]
In fact, 1950, I don't know like that

[01:53:59.830 --> 01:54:00.610]
34

[01:54:01.150 --> 01:54:01.810]
Four stars

[01:54:02.530 --> 01:54:02.930]
34

[01:54:05.050 --> 01:54:07.150]
Bradwick Crawford and Judy Holiday

[01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:08.950]
What a memory

[01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:10.750]
Well, I mean, I'm looking at him, you know

[01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:14.910]
But I'm looking at that other guy and I can't think of what his name is and I don't want to

[01:54:15.670 --> 01:54:17.730]
There are just some guy, I don't understand it

[01:54:17.730 --> 01:54:19.990]
But just like that thing with Jeffrey Donovan

[01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:23.130]
Oh, he's such a hot looking guy, no he's not, he's gruesome

[01:54:23.130 --> 01:54:27.550]
I still say if you put a pile of steaming hot elephant crap on a plate

[01:54:27.550 --> 01:54:31.030]
And you pass it around and like everybody look at it

[01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:34.490]
And somebody says, boy, that looks really like lunch to me, you know

[01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:37.210]
Then there's something wrong there, do you follow what I'm saying?

[01:54:37.650 --> 01:54:40.970]
I mean a lot of things are very subjective and every different strokes, different folks

[01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:46.410]
All of that, some people like Bifuronis, some people like Veal Parmesan, whatever, that's fine

[01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:51.710]
But there are some things that are absolute, there is no question about like water is wet, okay?

[01:54:52.190 --> 01:54:53.370]
Is that a debatable point?

[01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:56.430]
Yeah, I don't know, sometimes the thing I discovered

[01:54:57.050 --> 01:54:57.530]
Water?

[01:54:58.230 --> 01:54:58.690]
Yeah

[01:54:59.310 --> 01:55:02.690]
No, I discovered the real cheap garbage bags

[01:55:02.690 --> 01:55:06.890]
Now I'm not one of those people that looks at prices when I go grocery shopping

[01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:08.330]
I don't care, I got a few bucks

[01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:12.410]
But like garbage bags, you don't want to spend a lot of money on, right?

[01:55:12.790 --> 01:55:13.330]
Yeah I do

[01:55:13.330 --> 01:55:16.530]
So they have those things with like 40 plastic garbage bags, black ones

[01:55:17.710 --> 01:55:20.630]
And it's almost impossible to open a damn garbage bag up

[01:55:20.630 --> 01:55:21.890]
You know what you follow what I'm saying?

[01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.570]
No

[01:55:23.310 --> 01:55:24.670]
The Dow is down 144

[01:55:24.670 --> 01:55:26.030]
You don't know what I'm talking about?

[01:55:26.210 --> 01:55:26.370]
No

[01:55:26.890 --> 01:55:28.110]
Because they're like so tight

[01:55:28.110 --> 01:55:28.750]
Yeah

[01:55:28.750 --> 01:55:31.930]
So what you do is you moisten your fingers with a little bit of water out of the tap

[01:55:31.930 --> 01:55:35.450]
And then you like that plastic just opens right up

[01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:35.970]
I see

[01:55:37.290 --> 01:55:39.450]
See, you don't want to learn, that's the problem with you

[01:55:39.450 --> 01:55:39.990]
You're on your head

[01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:41.330]
I'm not a problem with the garbage bag

[01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.890]
Learn what?

[01:55:42.110 --> 01:55:46.010]
And we just got you learning all about damn cute cotton swabs, cute tips

[01:55:46.010 --> 01:55:47.210]
That's right, queer tips

[01:55:47.710 --> 01:55:48.850]
I have never been to that

[01:55:48.850 --> 01:55:50.370]
I've seen a few queer tips in my time

[01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:54.050]
Beyond tragic, anyway, before we do the thing

[01:55:54.050 --> 01:55:58.070]
The fake podcast in Ovis is, I believe man he's talking about the song you've to play on Zayda

[01:55:58.070 --> 01:55:59.090]
Neowakes me up in the morning

[01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:01.050]
Is that heavy metal?

[01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:03.210]
No

[01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:06.450]
Where, thank God those lights aren't going up

[01:56:06.450 --> 01:56:08.570]
Neowakes me up in the morning

[01:56:10.250 --> 01:56:11.870]
Neowakes me up with a smile

[01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:13.290]
I'm a smile, yeah

[01:56:13.290 --> 01:56:16.390]
Drinkin' my coffee, bunchin' down my donut

[01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:18.750]
We've seen a four of the dial

[01:56:19.390 --> 01:56:22.730]
We keep it bad, you can go, you know it

[01:56:23.410 --> 01:56:25.770]
Neowakes say to far out of dial

[01:56:26.810 --> 01:56:30.290]
Why did you work in my room with a dial in the nail

[01:56:30.290 --> 01:56:32.410]
We're late to four of the dial

[01:56:40.690 --> 01:56:41.970]
We were there

[01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:51.850]
Well, many Faith Paul is right

[01:56:51.850 --> 01:56:54.330]
Because Chronic Robb and Martin's been here

[01:56:57.770 --> 01:57:01.790]
I think the bit somebody was requesting a while ago was Neil wakes me up in the morning.

[01:57:02.130 --> 01:57:02.530]
Love the show.

[01:57:02.610 --> 01:57:06.850]
Hate George chronic Robin Martha's Vineyard loves the show, but he hates you like poison.

[01:57:07.090 --> 01:57:09.110]
At least you didn't say hate George like poison.

[01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:10.830]
Come on.

[01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:13.970]
If anybody out there hates George like poison, let's get those emails flooding in.

[01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.510]
Come on.

[01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:19.330]
I don't understand how a guy that's as kind of like milk toasty as you are.

[01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:21.790]
Get so much emotion.

[01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:23.670]
I mean, these people are just like rabid.

[01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:26.790]
What are these obsessed stalkers who blame whatever the hell they are?

[01:57:26.890 --> 01:57:27.890]
Doves down 172.

[01:57:28.050 --> 01:57:29.370]
We're losing most of yesterday's progress.

[01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:30.450]
Damn it.

[01:57:31.290 --> 01:57:34.550]
I thought that today was a for sure a buying opportunity.

[01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:37.170]
Every day is a selling opportunity.

[01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:38.850]
In other words, when it went, it went a doubt.

[01:57:38.970 --> 01:57:39.310]
Get out.

[01:57:40.450 --> 01:57:44.050]
Even after that brilliant speech last night, which was really sensational and everybody

[01:57:44.050 --> 01:57:46.730]
was all whipped up into a frenzy and everything good is going to happen.

[01:57:46.730 --> 01:57:48.310]
And we're going to do this in Yada Yada.

[01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:49.610]
And I don't know.

[01:57:49.850 --> 01:57:50.890]
It's going to take a long time.

[01:57:51.010 --> 01:57:53.690]
They left him a real mess, not by accident either.

[01:57:55.470 --> 01:57:58.610]
We're going to leave the shfarts are a real mess on his hands.

[01:57:58.750 --> 01:58:01.870]
Then he'll see how all that rent Rick of his now.

[01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:03.410]
What did that guy say about the.

[01:58:06.230 --> 01:58:08.330]
Tisdog gets me fired up about the rent Rick.

[01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:09.450]
Is not the word he used?

[01:58:10.810 --> 01:58:11.570]
I'm not sure.

[01:58:13.250 --> 01:58:14.630]
We don't have the whole thing.

[01:58:16.090 --> 01:58:17.210]
Y'all to email.

[01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:20.090]
Oh, that's right.

[01:58:20.090 --> 01:58:20.730]
It's under the female.

[01:58:20.890 --> 01:58:22.230]
Oh, scared the hell out of me.

[01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:23.630]
I'll be right back.

[01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:25.050]
Ventum is what he says.

[01:58:25.450 --> 01:58:26.090]
The Ventum.

[01:58:26.290 --> 01:58:27.470]
Oh, the Ventum, yeah.

[01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:29.010]
I've been listening to the.

[01:58:29.210 --> 01:58:34.090]
I'm for, um, got shown five, it's six years and, uh, I'm not playing that though,

[01:58:34.170 --> 01:58:36.870]
because there's a few things he borts out that aren't really all that well-bleed.

[01:58:36.890 --> 01:58:39.570]
Like, if you and I very well believe, but never the last.

[01:58:39.590 --> 01:58:40.010]
No, they're not.

[01:58:40.690 --> 01:58:43.750]
Can ever be too well-bleed in these in the times in which we live.

[01:58:44.430 --> 01:58:45.370]
And today's economy.

[01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:49.050]
I think I may have to rejoice for a third time.

[01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.910]
Really?

[01:58:50.450 --> 01:58:51.310]
Well, I don't know why.

[01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:53.850]
Maybe because I ate a ton of food yesterday with all the.

[01:58:53.850 --> 01:58:55.830]
Maybe, maybe, uh, you ate a lot of fiber.

[01:58:57.090 --> 01:58:58.650]
No, I'm not thinking.

[01:58:58.850 --> 01:59:00.970]
I had a couple of candy bars, a couple of Snickers.

[01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:06.130]
One of the regular old fashion one with a real dark brown wrapper and the new almond Snickers

[01:59:06.130 --> 01:59:07.190]
with a light brown wrapper.

[01:59:10.830 --> 01:59:11.550]
You're probably.

[01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:14.050]
Tisking right now.

[01:59:14.050 --> 01:59:16.850]
No, you shouldn't be surprised.

[01:59:17.110 --> 01:59:17.830]
That's what I eat.

[01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:21.570]
Well, I don't be between the two o'clock and two o' two.

[01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:22.850]
I run to the convenience store.

[01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:23.810]
I give me a couple of Snickers.

[01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:27.230]
I get in a cab with my lesbianies, uh, a Catholic driver.

[01:59:27.370 --> 01:59:28.890]
He roughs some ashes on my ass.

[01:59:29.210 --> 01:59:30.670]
He said, oh, it's ass Wednesday.

[01:59:31.670 --> 01:59:32.590]
Gordish, helping men.

[01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:34.970]
Oh, here we go.

[01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.930]
Gambling addiction.

[01:59:35.930 --> 01:59:36.610]
This is good.

[01:59:38.130 --> 01:59:38.930]
From Cliff.

[01:59:40.350 --> 01:59:43.250]
Monday night, I watched an A&E, a special on gambling addiction,

[01:59:43.250 --> 01:59:45.290]
specifically women who were addicted to gambling.

[01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:47.990]
Apparently women now make up about 48% of addicted gamblers.

[01:59:48.270 --> 01:59:51.570]
I believe that, especially a lot of these old Chinese women had woodmine.

[01:59:52.110 --> 01:59:54.710]
The show involved three different women who had major gambling addictions.

[01:59:54.710 --> 01:59:57.710]
One, a lady who was a bookkeeper for a Catholic church,

[01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:59.130]
embezzled 900 grand.

[01:59:59.630 --> 02:00:01.970]
She served four years in a minimum security prison.

[02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:04.830]
The IRS went after her for back taxes on the embezzled funds.

[02:00:05.210 --> 02:00:08.910]
Two, an ex news anchor woman actually went into labor while playing blackjack.

[02:00:09.570 --> 02:00:12.610]
She was back in the casino within three weeks of giving birth was eventually

[02:00:12.610 --> 02:00:15.190]
reported a child protective services for neglect.

[02:00:16.570 --> 02:00:19.810]
The last lady was spending her daughter's child support on slots.

[02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:23.270]
Funny thing about her case was that she ended up going to a gambling addiction facility

[02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.930]
in Las Vegas.

[02:00:25.890 --> 02:00:26.750]
Why is that funny?

[02:00:27.110 --> 02:00:29.770]
The reason I bring this up is because sometimes I worry about you, Neil.

[02:00:30.190 --> 02:00:30.650]
Uh-oh.

[02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:34.350]
Sometimes when you're waiting to go to woodbine, you sound like a junkie waiting for a fix.

[02:00:34.970 --> 02:00:39.270]
I would hate to see George, Flea, Joe Bell and Paco have to perform an intervention.

[02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:40.170]
Be careful, Uncle Leo.

[02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:41.610]
Concern Cliff and Kendall.

[02:00:42.430 --> 02:00:46.710]
And was surprised at that because Cliff and Kendall usually, you know, is fairly coherent.

[02:00:48.270 --> 02:00:50.930]
Although I better go get my pantaloons and shirt on.

[02:00:53.590 --> 02:00:54.830]
Jimmy Dorsky is back.

[02:00:54.970 --> 02:00:56.470]
Oh, I knew it wasn't going to be a perfect day.

[02:00:58.090 --> 02:01:03.070]
Oh, a bunch of Nimrods I work with were discussing lent earlier, along with all the stupid things

[02:01:03.070 --> 02:01:04.290]
they'd be getting up for 40 days.

[02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:07.430]
Oh, now wasn't that the movie with what's his name?

[02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:08.130]
Josh.

[02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:12.310]
Um, what is his name?

[02:01:12.570 --> 02:01:12.970]
Joshua.

[02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:14.110]
Josh Cortes.

[02:01:14.410 --> 02:01:15.350]
Yeah, Josh Carol.

[02:01:15.570 --> 02:01:18.810]
No, the one he was in one of the Halloween movies with Jamie Lee Curtis.

[02:01:18.970 --> 02:01:21.290]
Josh Hart, Hart, Hart, and very good.

[02:01:21.550 --> 02:01:22.050]
Yeah, totally.

[02:01:22.130 --> 02:01:23.290]
He was also in Titanic.

[02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:24.510]
Wasn't he not Titanic?

[02:01:24.810 --> 02:01:25.270]
I don't know.

[02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:25.690]
Pearl Harbor.

[02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.330]
Okay.

[02:01:26.830 --> 02:01:29.590]
Anyway, he was in that 40 days and 40 nights where he couldn't touch it.

[02:01:29.670 --> 02:01:30.330]
Couldn't squeeze it.

[02:01:30.410 --> 02:01:34.270]
Couldn't, you know, and quite frankly, after having, they showed that.

[02:01:34.270 --> 02:01:36.570]
That Halloween one again, he's not, he's not much.

[02:01:37.330 --> 02:01:38.310]
He looks good from a distance.

[02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.870]
I'm sorry.

[02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:40.530]
I don't want to get the rooster cogburn upset.

[02:01:41.230 --> 02:01:45.830]
Josh Hart, he looks good from about a mile away with your glasses off.

[02:01:46.710 --> 02:01:50.830]
Anyway, unaware of my freaking atheism, they eventually asked me what I'd be giving up

[02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:51.410]
for 40 days.

[02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:55.750]
My answer to me, Dorsky says, superstitions that invented by ancient gold herders who

[02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:58.950]
believed the earth was flat and that two of every living species lived with them

[02:01:58.950 --> 02:02:00.850]
when, within walking distance of Noah's house.

[02:02:03.330 --> 02:02:06.110]
That pretty much ended the conversation everyone got back to work.

[02:02:06.170 --> 02:02:06.570]
I was good.

[02:02:07.070 --> 02:02:09.330]
Also I used two cute tips in each year every morning.

[02:02:09.410 --> 02:02:13.230]
My ears are probably cleaner than my ass most days since Jimmy Dorsky.

[02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:13.970]
I told you he's good.

[02:02:14.970 --> 02:02:17.330]
His ears are cleaner than his ass.

[02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:21.790]
Well, I hope so, unless he's got Schmidt for brains and it's like seeping out.

[02:02:23.070 --> 02:02:25.390]
Here's one from the chronic Jimmy Cifilis.

[02:02:27.690 --> 02:02:30.830]
It says, George is the worst talk show host in the history of South Florida.

[02:02:30.970 --> 02:02:36.390]
He makes John Broward sound like a great broadcaster from Jimmy Cifilis.

[02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:40.630]
Oh, Misha's back.

[02:02:41.770 --> 02:02:42.610]
Good old Misha.

[02:02:42.730 --> 02:02:44.790]
Maybe she's reminding me about Cristiano Ronaldo which I would.

[02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:47.610]
Could you please play the Howard David?

[02:02:47.790 --> 02:02:49.150]
I forgot to ask her that favor.

[02:02:49.270 --> 02:02:50.590]
Please please play what?

[02:02:52.450 --> 02:02:54.250]
Please play the Howard David bits.

[02:02:54.250 --> 02:02:59.830]
I see all of them love you and yes, I do fantasize about Cristiano and he is Portugacy

[02:02:59.830 --> 02:03:00.050]
Neil.

[02:03:00.310 --> 02:03:02.430]
You have no idea what he does to my mind.

[02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:03.610]
Oh, believe me, honey.

[02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:04.870]
He does the same thing to my mind.

[02:03:05.010 --> 02:03:07.390]
And here's a picture of Cristiano bathing suit.

[02:03:07.390 --> 02:03:07.750]
Whoa.

[02:03:12.170 --> 02:03:12.890]
Mucho Caliente.

[02:03:12.990 --> 02:03:13.550]
Trust me.

[02:03:13.630 --> 02:03:14.290]
He is Portugacy.

[02:03:15.690 --> 02:03:17.730]
He's got some Portuguese between his knees.

[02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:20.030]
Believe me?

[02:03:20.190 --> 02:03:20.950]
Cristiano Ronaldo.

[02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:24.230]
I'm not too much in the soccer, but most soccer players are pretty but are good.

[02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:25.070]
I don't know why they did.

[02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:30.930]
Most of them probably because they're like a British and South American.

[02:03:32.290 --> 02:03:34.190]
What's wrong with those Latin American soccer players?

[02:03:34.370 --> 02:03:35.150]
I am Italian too.

[02:03:36.570 --> 02:03:37.810]
I've told you about that.

[02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:41.730]
There are different kinds of looks like there are in every culture in Italy.

[02:03:42.910 --> 02:03:47.310]
And there are some people with beautiful ancient Roman schnazes and then there are people

[02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:51.110]
with like real big like, you know, they look like they're broken in four places, schnazes.

[02:03:52.130 --> 02:03:52.970]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[02:03:52.970 --> 02:03:53.570]
Sure do.

[02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:54.290]
Oh.

[02:03:54.570 --> 02:03:55.970]
A lot of statues and naked people.

[02:03:56.130 --> 02:03:57.550]
A lot of naked penises in Rome.

[02:03:57.730 --> 02:03:58.190]
I'll tell you that.

[02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:59.470]
And some in statues too.

[02:04:01.230 --> 02:04:05.150]
Billy says, here's one for George.

[02:04:06.930 --> 02:04:10.290]
I'm writing to you as a fan of yours for years, but now the time has come to put your sidekick

[02:04:10.290 --> 02:04:11.190]
in charge of the show.

[02:04:11.970 --> 02:04:14.930]
I think you would be greatest as producer chiming in and playing funny drops.

[02:04:15.410 --> 02:04:17.130]
How hand over the throne, old you.

[02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:19.370]
Let the young Cuban do his things sincerely, Billy.

[02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:22.010]
What do you think?

[02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:23.690]
Yeah, sure.

[02:04:24.310 --> 02:04:26.970]
I'll play the drop, the bits like that.

[02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:29.010]
Sure, let's pray to pay treks to.

[02:04:30.010 --> 02:04:30.230]
No.

[02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:31.730]
Oh no.

[02:04:32.230 --> 02:04:34.490]
I'm already a sacrifice, 50% of my pay.

[02:04:34.810 --> 02:04:36.190]
And not too happy about it.

[02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:39.050]
That was down 156.

[02:04:39.170 --> 02:04:40.250]
See, that was down.

[02:04:40.450 --> 02:04:41.370]
Nobody's got a job.

[02:04:41.370 --> 02:04:42.150]
We're in a depression.

[02:04:42.430 --> 02:04:44.710]
You got to understand why you had to give up 50% of your pain.

[02:04:44.770 --> 02:04:46.770]
I mean, who the hell can sell your show?

[02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:50.550]
586 votes on the pool.

[02:04:50.670 --> 02:04:52.470]
We're going to do over 600 and we do legit.

[02:04:52.570 --> 02:04:53.750]
We don't let you vote 100 times.

[02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:58.670]
Oh, Adam Oshmuck in Kitchener Water Looses if you tried the new Rocky Road Snickers.

[02:04:58.950 --> 02:05:00.330]
Oh, that's just what I need to hear about.

[02:05:00.710 --> 02:05:01.930]
Now, that's a good chocolate bar.

[02:05:02.350 --> 02:05:04.510]
I have about three or four of those and I'm done for the day.

[02:05:05.010 --> 02:05:06.750]
It's his Adam Oshmuck.

[02:05:09.290 --> 02:05:09.910]
Pudgy Adam.

[02:05:10.050 --> 02:05:12.310]
That's why he's pudgy because he's eating all of them stinking candy bars.

[02:05:12.750 --> 02:05:14.790]
Rocky Road, though, is my favorite ice cream flavor.

[02:05:16.050 --> 02:05:17.250]
Maybe next to fish food.

[02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:20.670]
So Rocky Road Snickers would just send me an orbit.

[02:05:20.830 --> 02:05:22.390]
I'll have to look for those today at two o'clock.

[02:05:22.710 --> 02:05:23.290]
Maybe I'll go now.

[02:05:25.070 --> 02:05:26.570]
Maybe George will finish the show today.

[02:05:26.650 --> 02:05:30.030]
Maybe like that email said, hand the reins over to George.

[02:05:31.670 --> 02:05:34.970]
Don't let me forget to get to that story about the Q-tips slavery.

[02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:36.590]
Oh, the Jackson's all that.

[02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:37.050]
Yeah.

[02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:38.590]
I don't even know what it's all about.

[02:05:38.810 --> 02:05:39.190]
Me either.

[02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:42.190]
But I heard you babbling about it.

[02:05:42.190 --> 02:05:43.550]
And SUDD was talking about it.

[02:05:44.090 --> 02:05:44.570]
Talking what?

[02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.970]
Cran?

[02:05:45.230 --> 02:05:45.470]
Yes.

[02:05:47.170 --> 02:05:48.310]
He was talking what?

[02:05:48.710 --> 02:05:51.010]
He said there's this place called Slaveland or something like that.

[02:05:51.050 --> 02:05:54.370]
It's like a theme park where you can relive the slave.

[02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:56.110]
Well, Michael famous for theme parks.

[02:05:56.450 --> 02:05:58.050]
He had a cell that the Neverland.

[02:05:58.270 --> 02:05:59.590]
Maybe he's got Slaveland now.

[02:06:01.730 --> 02:06:04.010]
One of Pop superstar Michael Jackson's brothers, Marion.

[02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:05.270]
Oh, always, oh, Marlon.

[02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:07.030]
I thought it said Marion.

[02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:12.690]
It's involved in a controversial plan to develop a $3.4 billion Slaveland Memorial and

[02:06:12.690 --> 02:06:15.430]
Luxury Resort in Pedagorean, Nigeria.

[02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:19.930]
I sure wish I could say Nigeria the way I used to say it, but I doesn't do it.

[02:06:20.230 --> 02:06:20.550]
Right.

[02:06:21.050 --> 02:06:21.410]
Nothing today.

[02:06:21.490 --> 02:06:22.010]
It doesn't do it.

[02:06:22.030 --> 02:06:22.310]
Not the way.

[02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:23.910]
Not the times have changed real bad.

[02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:24.830]
Now everybody's uptight.

[02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:26.070]
And always got a sense of humor anymore.

[02:06:26.530 --> 02:06:27.010]
Oh, gee.

[02:06:27.130 --> 02:06:28.810]
And then of course we get like OJ McDuffee.

[02:06:28.810 --> 02:06:30.590]
He'll be trying to get me a I'mist.

[02:06:31.230 --> 02:06:32.550]
OJ and all his buddies, you know.

[02:06:34.030 --> 02:06:36.150]
Bo Camper and Sid the Yidd and all these guys.

[02:06:36.570 --> 02:06:37.890]
Oh, we're going to get Rodgers fired.

[02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:38.370]
You'll see.

[02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.970]
Yeah, sure.

[02:06:39.870 --> 02:06:44.290]
Swish will think and it is true that all those people do listen.

[02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:45.410]
I mean like religiously.

[02:06:45.630 --> 02:06:47.810]
Well, Paul Rodriguez is back.

[02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:50.490]
First I got turned on the Q tips by my wife.

[02:06:50.590 --> 02:06:53.810]
I get water in my ears when I shower and use the Q tips to soak it up.

[02:06:54.410 --> 02:07:00.370]
In the interim, I've discovered that if I have a clitoris, excuse me.

[02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:05.770]
I've discovered that if I have a clitoris, it's in my right ear.

[02:07:05.790 --> 02:07:06.630]
What a sensation.

[02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:11.670]
I see I didn't know that Paul had a clitoris anywhere, but nevertheless.

[02:07:12.830 --> 02:07:14.250]
It's in his rear ear.

[02:07:15.150 --> 02:07:17.310]
Nobody's supposed to do stick it in there and hum cough.

[02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:18.830]
Park like a dog.

[02:07:19.150 --> 02:07:19.970]
What are you supposed to do?

[02:07:20.110 --> 02:07:21.890]
I thought Q tips were to clean your ears out.

[02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:23.310]
I didn't realize they were for all these other.

[02:07:23.490 --> 02:07:23.730]
The rise.

[02:07:24.190 --> 02:07:24.910]
Wonderful thing.

[02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:27.810]
It's not just the one to two hour.

[02:07:28.250 --> 02:07:29.210]
It's a phenomenon.

[02:07:35.190 --> 02:07:38.990]
Start spreading the news.

[02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:43.510]
Obama will make a change.

[02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:48.890]
He's gonna make sure of it.

[02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:51.890]
New press, new press.

[02:07:53.010 --> 02:07:59.910]
These economy blues might not go away.

[02:07:59.910 --> 02:08:01.590]
I'm dying out of here.

[02:08:01.730 --> 02:08:06.030]
He'll take a three point shot at it.

[02:08:06.030 --> 02:08:09.250]
New press, new press.

[02:08:10.410 --> 02:08:16.330]
He'll take the offense where and kid push.

[02:08:17.410 --> 02:08:20.830]
Out of there, welcome Barack.

[02:08:21.850 --> 02:08:26.110]
New press, new press.

[02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:30.250]
Yeah, a civil-led speech last night.

[02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:34.130]
And what do we get emails about Nancy Pelosi's gigantic jiggling breasts?

[02:08:34.490 --> 02:08:37.510]
I mean, they got their eye on the important things.

[02:08:37.770 --> 02:08:41.230]
Like I said, just because it's big.

[02:08:42.270 --> 02:08:44.090]
Don't you care about what it's attached to?

[02:08:44.530 --> 02:08:45.110]
We're discussing that.

[02:08:45.110 --> 02:08:46.010]
I don't understand that.

[02:08:46.210 --> 02:08:46.570]
Philan shows.

[02:08:47.810 --> 02:08:48.910]
You were discussing what?

[02:08:49.170 --> 02:08:50.090]
Body versus face.

[02:08:50.250 --> 02:08:53.150]
I don't know how anybody can get past the face if they have a good body.

[02:08:53.150 --> 02:08:54.550]
I got news for him.

[02:08:54.630 --> 02:08:56.530]
Nancy Pelosi, those things are so saggy.

[02:08:56.550 --> 02:08:57.890]
They probably hanged on kneecaps.

[02:08:58.650 --> 02:09:01.650]
You can make body versus face.

[02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:04.070]
Oh, all about the face.

[02:09:05.970 --> 02:09:07.410]
Anyway, here's another one from Harry.

[02:09:07.710 --> 02:09:08.650]
Just out of control.

[02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:11.850]
Out of control, Harry, on Sunny Island's beach.

[02:09:12.830 --> 02:09:15.170]
I was listening to QMLS then after the A show.

[02:09:15.550 --> 02:09:17.790]
At 12.45 AM, I heard your voice on an ad.

[02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:21.510]
The ad plays a bit to the tuno.

[02:09:21.570 --> 02:09:22.570]
She's got a ticket to ride.

[02:09:22.570 --> 02:09:24.090]
Some of the words I believe are.

[02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:25.510]
She's got a toughest to ride.

[02:09:25.690 --> 02:09:26.630]
And don't play it no more.

[02:09:26.730 --> 02:09:27.450]
Don't play it no more.

[02:09:29.190 --> 02:09:31.510]
You won't believe that in the ad there are different fart noises.

[02:09:31.970 --> 02:09:33.110]
Oh, then this must be online.

[02:09:33.410 --> 02:09:33.730]
He was listening.

[02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:34.230]
Must be.

[02:09:34.930 --> 02:09:37.730]
How can Joyce allow a fart in your ads at 1 AM but not live on your show?

[02:09:38.110 --> 02:09:38.530]
Ask Harry.

[02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:39.550]
Get some help, Harry.

[02:09:39.710 --> 02:09:39.950]
Okay.

[02:09:40.490 --> 02:09:42.890]
They have these wonderful pills to take for insomnia.

[02:09:43.190 --> 02:09:44.770]
Take a whole bottle full and see if it works.

[02:09:46.130 --> 02:09:46.450]
God.

[02:09:48.930 --> 02:09:49.250]
Almighty.

[02:09:51.330 --> 02:09:54.170]
Paul says we all get our info on the web.

[02:09:54.510 --> 02:09:55.890]
I happen to like the Rangers, but let's face it,

[02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:57.230]
Rennie and the Rangers blow big time.

[02:09:57.730 --> 02:09:59.350]
I'd like to hear you back in Georgia's good too.

[02:10:00.990 --> 02:10:02.750]
That's from Monday.

[02:10:03.110 --> 02:10:03.330]
Wow.

[02:10:04.210 --> 02:10:06.270]
Boy, we must be down to a precious few now.

[02:10:09.090 --> 02:10:10.390]
I'm reading crap from Monday.

[02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:11.310]
It's only 102.

[02:10:12.450 --> 02:10:13.230]
Oh, boy.

[02:10:15.710 --> 02:10:18.370]
I'm saving that story about the resort.

[02:10:18.810 --> 02:10:19.170]
Okay.

[02:10:19.450 --> 02:10:19.710]
Save land.

[02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:21.370]
Where is it now?

[02:10:21.410 --> 02:10:22.290]
At least tell me that much.

[02:10:22.990 --> 02:10:22.990]

[02:10:23.470 --> 02:10:23.610]
Oh.

[02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:26.710]
But Daggerie, Nigeria, where where that is.

[02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:28.870]
I don't get there's often as they used to.

[02:10:29.410 --> 02:10:31.450]
By the way, fake, uh, uh,

[02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:32.930]
Manny from Kendall get lost.

[02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:37.430]
Oh, I can't believe you and George don't remember that thing was, yeah, okay.

[02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.710]
Great.

[02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:38.430]
We don't.

[02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:38.690]
Sorry.

[02:10:41.250 --> 02:10:42.870]
Don't remember and don't care about it.

[02:10:42.910 --> 02:10:44.350]
You know, has all simers and I smoked dope.

[02:10:44.350 --> 02:10:44.850]
So what do you want?

[02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:45.190]
That's right.

[02:10:45.370 --> 02:10:47.370]
There you go.

[02:10:47.370 --> 02:10:49.050]
Oh, don't tell me Jimmy Dorsky is back.

[02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:52.210]
Just wanted to say that George rules all the naysayers should get some q-tips.

[02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:53.150]
Clean out their ears.

[02:10:54.330 --> 02:10:56.250]
Not so they can listen to the show more clearly.

[02:10:56.610 --> 02:10:58.830]
And so the bullet will have a clear path to their feeble brains.

[02:10:59.910 --> 02:11:00.490]
Jimmy Dorsky.

[02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:03.710]
I said something good about his previous email right away.

[02:11:03.810 --> 02:11:04.190]
There he is.

[02:11:04.450 --> 02:11:04.830]
That's okay.

[02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:05.830]
We'll take anything now.

[02:11:06.330 --> 02:11:07.630]
Neil at NeilRodgers.com.

[02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:08.450]
Keep them coming.

[02:11:09.590 --> 02:11:13.050]
This is the day for all the chronics, all the fakers to come out of the closet.

[02:11:13.790 --> 02:11:15.830]
You know who we have in her truck in a long time.

[02:11:16.690 --> 02:11:17.010]
Who?

[02:11:17.170 --> 02:11:17.330]
Who?

[02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:18.670]
Who got the fake Barry Jackass?

[02:11:20.150 --> 02:11:20.470]
Okay.

[02:11:20.710 --> 02:11:21.170]
Maybe you have.

[02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:24.650]
Maybe I have one, but under a different name.

[02:11:25.590 --> 02:11:26.810]
No, no, but you're in the following.

[02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:27.410]
I'm saying.

[02:11:27.930 --> 02:11:29.030]
No, see the way you look.

[02:11:29.130 --> 02:11:31.970]
The way you look at it, we have to know the true identities, which we don't.

[02:11:31.970 --> 02:11:32.690]
No, I don't have to.

[02:11:35.370 --> 02:11:38.050]
You take something so simple and you have to complicate it.

[02:11:38.110 --> 02:11:38.290]
No.

[02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:40.550]
The fake Barry Jackass.

[02:11:40.710 --> 02:11:43.490]
Where's all that information about the new sports station in 940?

[02:11:43.490 --> 02:11:46.970]
Where's that fake Barry and Tommy, a real or fake Tommy jica?

[02:11:48.970 --> 02:11:52.070]
What was the rumor that they were trying to hire me foe to do mornings over there?

[02:11:52.210 --> 02:11:53.250]
Oh my god.

[02:11:53.590 --> 02:11:54.510]
I mean, oh my god.

[02:11:54.730 --> 02:11:54.950]
Right.

[02:11:55.290 --> 02:11:55.730]
Or even.

[02:11:55.850 --> 02:11:56.790]
Oh my god.

[02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:57.470]
That one too.

[02:11:59.590 --> 02:12:01.250]
Talk about a death wish.

[02:12:01.870 --> 02:12:02.490]
Me foe.

[02:12:05.630 --> 02:12:07.450]
Maybe they'd like to give you your own show on there.

[02:12:07.610 --> 02:12:08.930]
The anti-sports show on 940.

[02:12:08.930 --> 02:12:09.270]
Right.

[02:12:09.570 --> 02:12:12.770]
At least there's signal you can hear it.

[02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:17.790]
50,000 watts, baby.

[02:12:18.910 --> 02:12:20.230]
50,000 watts.

[02:12:20.630 --> 02:12:22.090]
W-I-N-Z.

[02:12:22.890 --> 02:12:24.530]
Fox Sports Radio coming soon.

[02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:26.030]
That's what we need.

[02:12:27.390 --> 02:12:29.890]
As they say in Hungary, Draftos, Xavier Lachenkoff.

[02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:33.550]
You know what that means, of course.

[02:12:34.330 --> 02:12:34.510]
Right.

[02:12:35.570 --> 02:12:36.030]
What?

[02:12:36.450 --> 02:12:37.650]
I need that like I need to hold on the head.

[02:12:37.650 --> 02:12:38.130]
Right.

[02:12:38.510 --> 02:12:39.690]
See how well I taught?

[02:12:40.030 --> 02:12:42.510]
I know more Yiddish than everyone I know about you.

[02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:45.190]
Here's one from the fake Neelan, Canadia.

[02:12:45.450 --> 02:12:46.950]
I love Jolly Jo and Crazy McCain.

[02:12:48.010 --> 02:12:49.450]
From the fake Neelan, Canadia.

[02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:51.970]
What are you laughing about?

[02:12:52.150 --> 02:12:52.490]
That's good.

[02:12:52.750 --> 02:12:53.150]
Nothing that's cute.

[02:12:53.250 --> 02:12:54.730]
At least it's somebody new and different anyway.

[02:12:54.730 --> 02:12:54.890]
That's right.

[02:12:54.970 --> 02:12:57.330]
Or at least it's somebody old with a new and different name.

[02:12:58.970 --> 02:13:00.310]
600, three votes on our pool.

[02:13:00.450 --> 02:13:01.450]
We're impressed by that.

[02:13:01.950 --> 02:13:05.130]
I mean, we are going to get like 148,000 like Jorge Sadano.

[02:13:05.810 --> 02:13:09.090]
Who really has like 15 people have owed like 100,000 times each?

[02:13:10.910 --> 02:13:11.690]
Hock Mark.

[02:13:12.130 --> 02:13:13.250]
Oh, God.

[02:13:14.810 --> 02:13:18.450]
Mark Hockman, 790, the ticket, Waxie, Lincoln Financial Media, LLC.

[02:13:20.810 --> 02:13:24.390]
The one miracle is that they're still pumping out the crap.

[02:13:24.570 --> 02:13:26.310]
Now that's the amazing part that they're still on the air.

[02:13:28.050 --> 02:13:32.410]
Of course, in our case, with Joe Bell at the helm, that was down 126.

[02:13:34.570 --> 02:13:38.430]
Okay, here's the story of a lovely lady.

[02:13:39.530 --> 02:13:41.290]
That was such a bad show.

[02:13:41.670 --> 02:13:42.150]
Yes, it was.

[02:13:43.090 --> 02:13:44.310]
An annoying show.

[02:13:44.670 --> 02:13:44.830]
Yep.

[02:13:46.850 --> 02:13:49.330]
And there wasn't even anybody cute on that show.

[02:13:49.490 --> 02:13:52.130]
There wasn't like my three sons.

[02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:54.270]
Oh.

[02:13:54.410 --> 02:13:55.070]
This is a story.

[02:13:58.590 --> 02:13:59.030]
Oh.

[02:13:59.930 --> 02:14:05.190]
And then of course, she started really shmurring on the Western oil, Florence Henderson.

[02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:07.550]
She started shmurring.

[02:14:07.630 --> 02:14:10.090]
And then what's his name, who was, uh...

[02:14:10.090 --> 02:14:11.910]
What was his name?

[02:14:12.670 --> 02:14:12.790]
Reed.

[02:14:14.890 --> 02:14:16.010]
Reed Wilde, something.

[02:14:16.530 --> 02:14:17.010]
Reed my lips.

[02:14:17.950 --> 02:14:18.370]
Greg Reed.

[02:14:18.830 --> 02:14:19.830]
Yeah, Greg Reed was...

[02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:20.290]
Wow.

[02:14:20.610 --> 02:14:21.090]
Something Reed.

[02:14:21.810 --> 02:14:21.990]
Oh.

[02:14:22.570 --> 02:14:25.170]
And you could Google it, but it's too close to the end of the show.

[02:14:25.170 --> 02:14:30.030]
I got my pantaloupies and my shirt on, and I got my shoes over to the side there.

[02:14:31.130 --> 02:14:34.130]
So, Cliff and Kendall, you better start worrying because I got a real problem.

[02:14:35.150 --> 02:14:36.070]
And you know what the problem is?

[02:14:36.630 --> 02:14:36.910]
What?

[02:14:37.310 --> 02:14:37.850]
Not winning enough.

[02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:40.690]
Am I just having to do them amazingly well?

[02:14:42.010 --> 02:14:45.670]
Last night, I played a quick hit because they're switching over to the new, uh...

[02:14:45.670 --> 02:14:46.510]
Wheel of Fortune machines.

[02:14:46.690 --> 02:14:48.790]
They haven't finished, at least last night they hadn't.

[02:14:49.330 --> 02:14:50.810]
So I had to find something else to play.

[02:14:50.810 --> 02:14:53.210]
5 cent quick hit, Robert Reed.

[02:14:56.850 --> 02:14:58.270]
He was, uh...

[02:14:58.270 --> 02:14:58.410]
Yeah.

[02:14:58.930 --> 02:14:59.890]
And now he's dead.

[02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:04.410]
One of Pop Superstar Michael Jackson's brothers, Marlon,

[02:15:05.730 --> 02:15:10.030]
is involved in a controversial plan to develop a $3.4 billion slavery memorial

[02:15:10.030 --> 02:15:13.650]
and luxury resort in Badaguri, Nigeria.

[02:15:15.070 --> 02:15:18.830]
The historic slave port is to be transformed through the bizarre combination of a

[02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:24.610]
slave history theme park and the museum dedicated to double Grammy winning pop soul group,

[02:15:24.810 --> 02:15:25.550]
the Jackson Five.

[02:15:26.910 --> 02:15:28.310]
Slavery and the Jackson Five.

[02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:30.030]
All right.

[02:15:31.130 --> 02:15:34.010]
The idea is that man will help attract African American tourists,

[02:15:34.410 --> 02:15:35.930]
came to trace their roots back to Nigeria.

[02:15:39.210 --> 02:15:40.030]
Oh yeah.

[02:15:41.230 --> 02:15:44.490]
The men behind the plan say it will honor the history of the transatlantic slave trade

[02:15:44.490 --> 02:15:46.970]
and provide employment opportunities for Nigerians,

[02:15:46.970 --> 02:15:49.970]
but the plan has been condemned by Nigerian commentators.

[02:15:50.830 --> 02:15:52.810]
Honor the history of the transatlantic slave trade.

[02:15:53.210 --> 02:15:53.910]
What does that mean?

[02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.770]
I don't know.

[02:15:57.370 --> 02:15:57.550]
Oh.

[02:15:58.110 --> 02:15:59.330]
Well think about it.

[02:16:00.730 --> 02:16:03.970]
The African American history trail is worth billions of dollars the developers say.

[02:16:04.650 --> 02:16:07.830]
Ghana and Senegal have successfully turned slave ports into tourist attractions.

[02:16:08.210 --> 02:16:10.810]
Now that I got my pants on and I think I've got it in like...

[02:16:10.810 --> 02:16:13.510]
I've got my belt on like one notch too tight.

[02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:14.510]
Really?

[02:16:14.710 --> 02:16:18.030]
And that rejoicing I think is definitely going to be a reality sometimes.

[02:16:19.570 --> 02:16:21.270]
I'm just losing one up.

[02:16:21.390 --> 02:16:21.650]
The belt.

[02:16:22.190 --> 02:16:22.370]
Oh.

[02:16:23.070 --> 02:16:23.070]

[02:16:23.910 --> 02:16:24.970]
Loosen up a notch.

[02:16:25.130 --> 02:16:25.430]
Okay.

[02:16:25.630 --> 02:16:26.330]
There we go.

[02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:27.870]
Oh.

[02:16:27.970 --> 02:16:28.690]
So much better.

[02:16:29.610 --> 02:16:30.870]
I must be getting really fat.

[02:16:31.590 --> 02:16:31.770]
Ter.

[02:16:32.590 --> 02:16:34.590]
The developers say, did you come and get tired?

[02:16:34.990 --> 02:16:35.210]
Yeah.

[02:16:35.310 --> 02:16:35.870]
You heard it?

[02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.230]
Burger.

[02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:42.010]
The developers say the pedagogy historical resort will be marketed to African American tourists

[02:16:42.010 --> 02:16:45.110]
as a mixture of luxury tourist attractions and historical education.

[02:16:46.470 --> 02:16:50.630]
Visitors will be able to see the root their ancestors walked, shackled together as they were whipped

[02:16:50.630 --> 02:16:51.730]
toward the point of no return.

[02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:56.510]
They can then retire to their five-star hotel to drink cocktails by the pool.

[02:16:57.150 --> 02:16:57.530]
Retire.

[02:16:59.070 --> 02:17:02.990]
Visitors will be able to pay their respects at the site of a masked grave for those who died before

[02:17:02.990 --> 02:17:04.650]
boarding ships across the Atlantic Ocean.

[02:17:05.590 --> 02:17:08.010]
And then travel a few yards in a buggy to play a round of golf.

[02:17:09.130 --> 02:17:11.230]
Oh, God.

[02:17:12.210 --> 02:17:12.610]
Woo.

[02:17:12.990 --> 02:17:13.830]
Talk about sick.

[02:17:15.430 --> 02:17:19.790]
They can visit a replica slave ship to see the conditions African-sovered before visiting

[02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:22.330]
the World's-Owned Museum dedicated to the career of the Jackson Five.

[02:17:23.930 --> 02:17:28.690]
Academics believe up to two million people died at least ten million transported to the Americas during the transatlantic

[02:17:28.690 --> 02:17:31.470]
slave trade between the 16th and 19th centuries.

[02:17:32.890 --> 02:17:43.470]
The Jackson's upbeat tunes like ABC and Blame It on the Buggy and live in the US and the UK's Disco throughout the 1970s.

[02:17:44.590 --> 02:17:49.210]
On display at the museum will be animatronic vignettes of the band.

[02:17:49.770 --> 02:17:50.990]
What is that?

[02:17:51.790 --> 02:17:52.830]
Like robots.

[02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:55.370]
Like you know the Hall of Presidents in Disney World.

[02:17:55.790 --> 02:17:56.690]
That kind of thing.

[02:17:57.150 --> 02:17:57.270]
No.

[02:17:59.570 --> 02:18:03.310]
Memorabilia and holographic displays of the group that launched the career of Michael Jackson.

[02:18:04.350 --> 02:18:10.330]
The pedagogy historical resorts development project will certainly enhance the quality of life for millions of people across Nigeria.

[02:18:10.810 --> 02:18:12.310]
Promotional material for the resorts says.

[02:18:13.530 --> 02:18:17.730]
But critics have dismissed the project as a cynical money-making scheme,

[02:18:18.290 --> 02:18:21.990]
inappropriate for the subject of such seriousness as the transatlantic slave trade.

[02:18:22.570 --> 02:18:25.890]
The idea to bring together slavery in the Jackson Five came during a visit tonight,

[02:18:26.010 --> 02:18:29.310]
a jury by US businessman and former Jackson singer Marlon Jackson.

[02:18:30.550 --> 02:18:35.030]
The Jackson family had been looking for a place to cite their Memorabilia collection for some time,

[02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:40.490]
so Gary Loster, former mayor of Saginaw, Michigan, and chief executive of the Motherland Group.

[02:18:42.550 --> 02:18:46.910]
We visited the side of the slave port in Badagri and Miriam Turnami and said, Marlon,

[02:18:47.290 --> 02:18:48.810]
and said, let's put it here, this is right.

[02:18:49.370 --> 02:18:50.690]
It's such an emotional place.

[02:18:51.010 --> 02:18:53.990]
I think we all felt it was the right place to have the Jackson family memorial.

[02:18:55.390 --> 02:18:59.550]
But respected writer and historian, Toyan Feloah, has condemned the project.

[02:19:00.590 --> 02:19:03.150]
It's not appropriate from a cultural or historical point of view.

[02:19:03.150 --> 02:19:05.850]
He says, those who are looking for money care about money, no other thing.

[02:19:07.170 --> 02:19:09.270]
The professor of history at the University of Texas,

[02:19:09.310 --> 02:19:12.230]
and author of many books on Nigerian diaspora, and African American history,

[02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:15.090]
said the development was exploiting painful history.

[02:19:16.510 --> 02:19:23.110]
Writer at commas and PR consultant, Don Eddenuba, said the result was being built by a company run by a white person,

[02:19:23.370 --> 02:19:24.270]
and there will be an uproar.

[02:19:25.530 --> 02:19:27.310]
This plan is morally reprehensible.

[02:19:27.310 --> 02:19:30.850]
It's like dancing on the graves of dead people and telling them you're honoring them, he said.

[02:19:31.350 --> 02:19:33.690]
The developers say they'll treat the slave memorial with sensitivity.

[02:19:34.210 --> 02:19:38.390]
They hope it will become a historical destination, similar to the Holocaust Museum in Berlin.

[02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:42.690]
The luxury hotels near the saddle provide jobs and development of the local economy, they say.

[02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:49.770]
The developers who include the creator of the hit TV series Power Rangers have ambition plans for the, ambitious plans for the resort.

[02:19:50.590 --> 02:19:55.410]
The motherland group says the resort alone will pull in 1.4 million visitors in the first year,

[02:19:55.690 --> 02:19:57.530]
rising to 4.4 million to five years.

[02:19:58.650 --> 02:20:03.290]
Mr. Loster says they'll have to work with the government to change some of the bureaucratic restrictions on tourists

[02:20:03.290 --> 02:20:05.690]
if their project is to attract the numbers it needs.

[02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:13.010]
Well, don't you want to go to Nigeria to see the slave trade museum?

[02:20:13.590 --> 02:20:13.930]
Right now.

[02:20:14.530 --> 02:20:15.990]
And Michael, Michael motorcycle.

[02:20:18.850 --> 02:20:20.490]
Real American A-hole.

[02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:23.310]
Real American A-holes.

[02:20:23.310 --> 02:20:24.750]
We salute you.

[02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:29.450]
Mrs. I already have six kids at home, but figured I'd have another eighth lady.

[02:20:29.630 --> 02:20:32.770]
Mrs. I already have six kids at home, but figured I'd have another eighth lady.

[02:20:33.550 --> 02:20:36.810]
You already have more babies than the average NBA player.

[02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:44.030]
And still you thought, hey, why don't I fire up that turkey baser one more time and see what shakes out?

[02:20:44.350 --> 02:20:46.890]
Here's the story of a dimension lady.

[02:20:46.890 --> 02:20:51.890]
14 kids and neither a husband, a job, or a place to live.

[02:20:52.050 --> 02:20:56.190]
Better get out of LA before Bob Barker has you spayed.

[02:20:57.450 --> 02:21:00.790]
You're currently receiving more donations than Darfur,

[02:21:01.210 --> 02:21:06.130]
and the only person getting Googled more than you is A-rod idiot cousin.

[02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:07.510]
But you don't care.

[02:21:08.010 --> 02:21:11.270]
You were mistaken for Angelina Jolie twice last week.

[02:21:11.450 --> 02:21:14.450]
And that doesn't include the hate mail from Jennifer Aniston now.

[02:21:14.450 --> 02:21:18.890]
And while we're at it, when grandma's house gets four clothes next month,

[02:21:19.290 --> 02:21:21.710]
maybe they should close something else too.

[02:21:22.450 --> 02:21:23.930]
So we salute you.

[02:21:24.330 --> 02:21:28.090]
Mrs. I already have six kids at home, but figured I'd have another eighth lady.

[02:21:28.690 --> 02:21:31.190]
You're $490 a month in foodstaffs.

[02:21:31.430 --> 02:21:34.750]
You're suspicious Frenchman secure and your others.

[02:21:35.250 --> 02:21:38.430]
You are a real American A-hole.

[02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.970]
Absolutely.

[02:21:38.970 --> 02:21:40.970]
OK, 119 at 560 WQM.

[02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:42.790]
We got 40-1 minutes to kill.

[02:21:43.110 --> 02:21:45.670]
Oh, let's subtract a spot and the last bit.

[02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.850]
OK.

[02:21:47.290 --> 02:21:49.530]
I'm just telling you, I'm just warning you, we're almost out of emails.

[02:21:50.570 --> 02:21:55.290]
Oh, I did do that bedtime story about the slave museum in Nigeria.

[02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:58.070]
So what was said saying about it?

[02:21:58.670 --> 02:21:59.470]
Do you want to go see that?

[02:21:59.650 --> 02:22:01.550]
I guess he read that story and he was telling me about it.

[02:22:02.290 --> 02:22:02.550]
Yeah.

[02:22:02.770 --> 02:22:03.630]
He just thought it was curious?

[02:22:04.970 --> 02:22:05.410]
Curious?

[02:22:06.090 --> 02:22:06.530]
Interesting.

[02:22:07.110 --> 02:22:08.890]
Money making opportunity, man.

[02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:10.510]
That's the Jackson's for it.

[02:22:10.530 --> 02:22:10.950]
They're desperate.

[02:22:11.010 --> 02:22:12.050]
They've fallen on hard times.

[02:22:12.570 --> 02:22:14.090]
And Michael's going to die any minute.

[02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:14.850]
All night, all the other crap.

[02:22:16.030 --> 02:22:19.750]
You think anybody would care about all those idiots that were standing out.

[02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:20.210]
That's close.

[02:22:20.470 --> 02:22:24.470]
I'm going to say, oh, save Michael, save Michael.

[02:22:24.470 --> 02:22:25.470]
Oh, blah, blah, yeah, right.

[02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:31.550]
Ron says I was in stitches with the ecliterus in the ear comment from the previous emailer.

[02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.990]
Yeah.

[02:22:32.290 --> 02:22:32.910]
He wasn't the only one.

[02:22:33.410 --> 02:22:41.750]
Reminds me of something Elton John said in GQ magazine a few years ago, when he was asked what was the most disgusting thing he ever had in his mouth, to which he responded ecliterus.

[02:22:43.070 --> 02:22:45.250]
Have you ever had ecliterus in your mouth, Neil?

[02:22:45.570 --> 02:22:46.370]
No, sorry, Ron.

[02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:47.510]
Can't say I've had the pleasure.

[02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:50.710]
This may be a good poll topic.

[02:22:51.090 --> 02:22:53.350]
What's the most disgusting thing you've ever had in your mouth?

[02:22:54.730 --> 02:22:58.790]
Ron says I continue to enjoy the show, although George does suck when he hosts.

[02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:03.430]
Well, maybe if George sucks, he can tell us what the most disgusting well.

[02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:04.410]
Yeah, well, better not.

[02:23:04.570 --> 02:23:04.950]
It wouldn't be that.

[02:23:06.610 --> 02:23:07.290]
Better not.

[02:23:08.850 --> 02:23:11.910]
I'm also getting emails saying that the, um, oh, here it is.

[02:23:13.890 --> 02:23:16.770]
The emailer about the fart noises is absolutely correct.

[02:23:17.710 --> 02:23:18.430]
Absolutely correct.

[02:23:18.730 --> 02:23:22.690]
I hear the same spot at 450 AM on my way to work, sincerely Vincent T.

[02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:27.110]
Now, are they, are they, well, if he's on his way to work, he's not listening online.

[02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:34.030]
Yeah, that must be because it's the safe haven between 10 PM and 6 AM.

[02:23:36.310 --> 02:23:37.250]
The safe haven.

[02:23:37.710 --> 02:23:38.310]
I don't know.

[02:23:38.470 --> 02:23:41.450]
Don't you remember a discussion event during the, um, public training?

[02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:43.650]
Yeah, but I also remember that doesn't apply to us.

[02:23:44.210 --> 02:23:45.770]
At least no one ever said that it did.

[02:23:45.770 --> 02:23:51.850]
Well, somebody better alert Joyce to the fact that WQM is playing fart noises in the overnight while people are trying to sleep.

[02:23:52.530 --> 02:23:54.290]
And they're playing fart noises.

[02:23:55.410 --> 02:23:55.830]
Wow.

[02:23:56.750 --> 02:24:07.930]
I don't think she'd take kindly to that because the one thing we know about Joyce is he's got a real serious problem with penis, vagina, and fart noises, not necessarily in that order.

[02:24:10.150 --> 02:24:13.190]
All depending on where the fart noises are emanating from.

[02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:20.430]
I'm telling you if she found out we'd be Joyce off to Laughus.

[02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:23.670]
That's a good idea.

[02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:25.010]
Just use it for whatever you want it to be.

[02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.850]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:24:26.050 --> 02:24:27.130]
I mean, we don't know what it really means.

[02:24:27.270 --> 02:24:28.570]
So I'm just going to throw it around there.

[02:24:30.310 --> 02:24:32.170]
Oh, here's one from Michelle.

[02:24:34.390 --> 02:24:37.890]
Michelle says just wanted to share a tip my doc told me about cleaning my ears.

[02:24:38.770 --> 02:24:41.810]
First, he told me you shouldn't stick anything bigger than your elbow in your ear.

[02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:43.470]
I guess that was a doctor joke.

[02:24:44.610 --> 02:24:48.950]
He said that most people aren't going to go to the doctor's office to get their ears properly cleaned.

[02:24:49.410 --> 02:24:54.510]
He suggested taking a Q-tip, dipping it in the hydrogen peroxide, then gently inserting it in your ear.

[02:24:54.770 --> 02:24:58.530]
You know, hydrogen peroxide like bubbles, you know, yes, foam like foams.

[02:24:58.810 --> 02:24:58.950]
Right.

[02:24:58.950 --> 02:25:00.630]
When it encounters something.

[02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:02.930]
Tilt your head in the opposite direction.

[02:25:03.330 --> 02:25:08.030]
So your ear faces the ceiling and you'll immediately hear and feel like a fizzing bubbling.

[02:25:08.190 --> 02:25:09.510]
And that's the hydrogen peroxide.

[02:25:10.530 --> 02:25:16.410]
Wait until it stops, then tilt your head in the opposite direction so that the, that ear is facing down, look it'll run out.

[02:25:16.990 --> 02:25:22.510]
Then you can stick in a dry Q-tip to dry up the ear and usually we'll get out more wax in the process.

[02:25:23.330 --> 02:25:24.090]
Thanks, Michelle.

[02:25:24.090 --> 02:25:26.010]
That's where Q-tip intensively they man.

[02:25:26.010 --> 02:25:28.830]
Sure. By the way, Lisa, those are raspberries, nutfarts.

[02:25:29.310 --> 02:25:29.570]
What?

[02:25:30.050 --> 02:25:32.510]
Those promos he put on there. Those are raspberries, nutfarts.

[02:25:32.690 --> 02:25:33.690]
Just for the, they're promos?

[02:25:34.470 --> 02:25:34.750]
Yeah.

[02:25:35.150 --> 02:25:35.830]
Promoes for the Homo?

[02:25:36.310 --> 02:25:36.770]
I assume.

[02:25:36.970 --> 02:25:38.630]
Well, we better not play them no more after that.

[02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:39.850]
Well, what are you talking about?

[02:25:41.310 --> 02:25:42.550]
Who told you this, Flea?

[02:25:42.690 --> 02:25:47.170]
Yeah, he sent me a text and said, those are raspberries, nutfarts.

[02:25:47.370 --> 02:25:49.090]
I started running promos last night.

[02:25:50.430 --> 02:25:50.770]
At night.

[02:25:51.890 --> 02:25:53.970]
He started running, but he's taken over now.

[02:25:53.970 --> 02:25:55.090]
I thought he was going to be the assistant.

[02:25:55.610 --> 02:25:56.950]
Let's hear it for Flea.

[02:25:56.990 --> 02:25:57.190]
Oh!

[02:25:57.390 --> 02:25:58.410]
This is really good news.

[02:25:58.730 --> 02:26:00.050]
Hey, Shove and Clarence out the door.

[02:26:01.170 --> 02:26:04.370]
When you had vacation, you were sick or whatever it was and he came in.

[02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:05.110]
I told him.

[02:26:05.890 --> 02:26:08.330]
I said, that's your responsibilities to get rid of Clarence.

[02:26:11.710 --> 02:26:11.990]
Yeah.

[02:26:12.190 --> 02:26:13.590]
I said, you got an 89, that is you.

[02:26:13.650 --> 02:26:16.290]
He said, I'd rather 89, I'm an 69, I'm not telling you that.

[02:26:17.730 --> 02:26:18.750]
That's what Flea said.

[02:26:20.250 --> 02:26:23.570]
This is for all the people who bitching complained about the show from Paul.

[02:26:24.110 --> 02:26:26.710]
Stop listening and kill yourself, you useless jerks.

[02:26:27.370 --> 02:26:28.590]
Stay happy, Neil and George.

[02:26:28.970 --> 02:26:30.830]
Still stuck in a Western Paul, I'm dying here.

[02:26:31.130 --> 02:26:31.850]
He's stuck in a Western.

[02:26:32.070 --> 02:26:33.070]
What's so bad about Western?

[02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:34.010]
Mm-hmm.

[02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:35.730]
Doesn't suds live in Western?

[02:26:36.350 --> 02:26:36.550]
Yeah.

[02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:45.850]
What in God's name is this?

[02:26:46.490 --> 02:26:49.270]
Oh, and by the way, that spot that you just played that I voiced?

[02:26:49.730 --> 02:26:49.990]
Yeah.

[02:26:50.210 --> 02:26:51.410]
It's money as hell.

[02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:54.450]
Sure is, that's how you record in that other room over there.

[02:26:54.570 --> 02:26:55.530]
I don't know what to do about that.

[02:26:55.530 --> 02:26:56.690]
What do you mean, that's how I record?

[02:26:57.110 --> 02:26:57.350]
All right.

[02:26:57.930 --> 02:26:59.210]
I recorded you in that other room.

[02:26:59.350 --> 02:27:01.250]
You remember the rigour we went through?

[02:27:01.770 --> 02:27:05.250]
Because I can't record you in here in this studio where I'm sitting right now.

[02:27:06.750 --> 02:27:10.210]
So I recorded you in the room that I'm looking at right now on the other side of that window there.

[02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:12.090]
And that's what it sounded like.

[02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:13.770]
It wasn't overmodulated, it wasn't anything.

[02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:17.390]
That's just what it sounds like when you record stuff in there.

[02:27:17.550 --> 02:27:17.770]
Bad.

[02:27:18.110 --> 02:27:18.290]
Bad.

[02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:24.450]
PR Ralph sends me Dr. Advice.

[02:27:24.750 --> 02:27:26.530]
Oh, God.

[02:27:26.830 --> 02:27:29.270]
And then it's long and it goes on and on and on.

[02:27:29.410 --> 02:27:30.210]
Oh, geez.

[02:27:31.130 --> 02:27:33.150]
Well, what is it that these people don't understand?

[02:27:33.950 --> 02:27:35.370]
Don't I make myself very clear?

[02:27:36.670 --> 02:27:36.970]
Queer?

[02:27:37.530 --> 02:27:37.970]
Yeah.

[02:27:38.330 --> 02:27:39.030]
Cute tip queer.

[02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:41.530]
Oh, PR Ralph, you're a friend.

[02:27:41.610 --> 02:27:42.350]
You're a Puerto Rican buddy.

[02:27:42.350 --> 02:27:43.370]
We hang out.

[02:27:43.530 --> 02:27:43.750]
Get it.

[02:27:43.850 --> 02:27:44.130]
Party.

[02:27:49.050 --> 02:27:51.430]
So we got farting stuff on the overnight.

[02:27:51.610 --> 02:27:52.630]
That's raspberries.

[02:27:53.550 --> 02:27:54.810]
All the fruits all the time.

[02:27:55.070 --> 02:28:00.230]
They'll call them fart sounds because then we'll get the what's his name, flea in the big trouble with joyous.

[02:28:01.090 --> 02:28:01.250]
Right.

[02:28:01.710 --> 02:28:04.290]
And last time we heard they were pretty tight two of them.

[02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:08.610]
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

[02:28:08.670 --> 02:28:10.010]
I think I'm running out of stamps today.

[02:28:10.990 --> 02:28:13.450]
Last half hour might just take some calls.

[02:28:14.230 --> 02:28:15.750]
Please don't do it.

[02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.530]
Please.

[02:28:16.950 --> 02:28:17.310]
Whatever.

[02:28:17.770 --> 02:28:18.610]
Whatever what?

[02:28:19.630 --> 02:28:20.510]
Whatever what up?

[02:28:20.650 --> 02:28:21.090]
Whatever shape?

[02:28:21.630 --> 02:28:22.070]
Yeah.

[02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:23.070]
It comes out.

[02:28:23.470 --> 02:28:24.990]
Whatever shape your stomach is in.

[02:28:25.690 --> 02:28:26.150]
What was that?

[02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:27.110]
Was that a pepto spot?

[02:28:27.250 --> 02:28:28.530]
What's spot was that?

[02:28:28.830 --> 02:28:29.790]
Doesn't ring a bell with me.

[02:28:31.270 --> 02:28:32.610]
Doesn't ring a bell with you?

[02:28:33.390 --> 02:28:36.570]
In fact, it was even a song that went with that.

[02:28:36.910 --> 02:28:37.890]
Oh, my God.

[02:28:37.890 --> 02:28:38.190]
I'm the best.

[02:28:38.470 --> 02:28:39.250]
Show me yours.

[02:28:39.410 --> 02:28:40.290]
I'll show you mine.

[02:28:43.270 --> 02:28:45.730]
I got something in the mail today.

[02:28:46.650 --> 02:28:49.590]
I tell you, it blew me away.

[02:28:50.210 --> 02:28:53.270]
Now that Bush is gone, things are going to worn.

[02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:55.590]
Obama, he wrote me a letter.

[02:28:58.250 --> 02:29:01.690]
He wrote me a letter saying it was degraded.

[02:29:01.950 --> 02:29:03.530]
We could be friends.

[02:29:05.350 --> 02:29:10.130]
Only thing he asked is that my new clear profile was in.

[02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:11.710]
No way.

[02:29:12.190 --> 02:29:14.470]
I hope he doesn't think that I'm a shop.

[02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:16.950]
Problems won't be solved.

[02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:18.410]
We they cease to bump.

[02:29:18.970 --> 02:29:20.290]
I am still in pain.

[02:29:20.630 --> 02:29:21.970]
That has not changed.

[02:29:22.710 --> 02:29:24.210]
Obama, he wrote me a letter.

[02:29:25.470 --> 02:29:27.690]
Obama, he wrote me a letter.

[02:29:28.290 --> 02:29:30.070]
He said, I love Obama.

[02:29:30.370 --> 02:29:32.030]
It's so exo, exo, exo.

[02:29:32.250 --> 02:29:32.710]
I love you.

[02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:33.950]
Wow, look at this one.

[02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:35.350]
Here's one that rips you an ass.

[02:29:36.350 --> 02:29:37.330]
Gee, what a shock.

[02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:40.850]
It says, I've always thought George was good and small doses, but after listening to him

[02:29:40.850 --> 02:29:47.630]
all last week, I wanted to stick a pickaxe in my ear and then use the acute tip.

[02:29:49.250 --> 02:29:55.090]
Sometimes, he should make an executive decision and put on the old tapes.

[02:29:56.210 --> 02:30:01.970]
Just curious how much, how much dollars do you spend or waste a wood on a weekly basis?

[02:30:01.970 --> 02:30:05.970]
Maybe you should donate it to a worthy cause rather than pump it into Poco's ass.

[02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.870]
How do you like that?

[02:30:08.350 --> 02:30:10.010]
How much money do I spend on your business?

[02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:12.110]
Get a life.

[02:30:13.430 --> 02:30:17.990]
Once the stick a pickaxe, have our permission to stick a pickaxe in your ear and...

[02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.350]
Wreck them!

[02:30:18.530 --> 02:30:19.550]
wherever else you want to stick it.

[02:30:22.310 --> 02:30:24.290]
How much money am I spending?

[02:30:25.690 --> 02:30:27.570]
And how much am I filtering over to Poco?

[02:30:27.570 --> 02:30:33.170]
And your business, 631 votes on a poll, pretty impressive, I would say, for a crappy poll like that.

[02:30:34.970 --> 02:30:36.130]
Do we want to change it?

[02:30:36.930 --> 02:30:38.430]
Let's see if Harris got the new one on there.

[02:30:38.530 --> 02:30:39.570]
Oh yeah, a brand-in poll.

[02:30:40.270 --> 02:30:42.030]
What minor injuries the most painful?

[02:30:42.390 --> 02:30:43.090]
Let's change it.

[02:30:44.250 --> 02:30:45.410]
I think this one blows.

[02:30:46.170 --> 02:30:47.870]
You like this poll about the chick cars?

[02:30:48.770 --> 02:30:49.570]
We've done it before.

[02:30:49.810 --> 02:30:50.090]
It's fine.

[02:30:50.830 --> 02:30:51.170]
We have?

[02:30:51.450 --> 02:30:51.670]
Yeah.

[02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.470]
Not me.

[02:30:53.070 --> 02:30:53.810]
Well, nevertheless.

[02:30:53.810 --> 02:30:56.070]
Well, I mean, I wouldn't be doing a poll on chick cars.

[02:30:56.070 --> 02:30:57.470]
I mean, old fag like me.

[02:30:58.950 --> 02:31:00.850]
What minor injuries the most painful?

[02:31:00.910 --> 02:31:01.970]
I'm going to tell you right now.

[02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:07.670]
I mean, here's one like getting a punch in the balls or a paper cut.

[02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:11.450]
Paper cut is just excruciatingly painful.

[02:31:11.930 --> 02:31:12.670]
You don't agree?

[02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:13.110]
No.

[02:31:13.250 --> 02:31:13.690]
I do agree.

[02:31:14.130 --> 02:31:15.730]
Oh, especially if it's on your tongue.

[02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:17.230]
Oh!

[02:31:18.030 --> 02:31:19.810]
A paper cut on your tongue?

[02:31:20.170 --> 02:31:20.310]
Yes.

[02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.650]
That's bad.

[02:31:21.650 --> 02:31:24.610]
Okay, here's the final result of the chick poll.

[02:31:25.370 --> 02:31:26.130]
The chick car.

[02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:27.770]
631 votes.

[02:31:28.010 --> 02:31:31.650]
Not 45,000 like Horace and Anna would have across the street.

[02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:33.570]
According to Mark Hockmer, China.

[02:31:34.490 --> 02:31:35.790]
The definitive chick car of all time.

[02:31:36.570 --> 02:31:38.130]
VW Cabriolay 175.

[02:31:39.350 --> 02:31:40.770]
VW Beetle 143.

[02:31:41.150 --> 02:31:42.670]
Mazda Miata 131.

[02:31:42.770 --> 02:31:45.910]
Those are the only three that really are having any votes.

[02:31:46.370 --> 02:31:48.290]
The rest is small potatoes like in your ears.

[02:31:49.050 --> 02:31:50.370]
Pontiac Fioro 133.

[02:31:50.370 --> 02:31:51.890]
VW Jetta 31.

[02:31:52.470 --> 02:31:53.790]
Mitsubishi Eclipse 23.

[02:31:54.230 --> 02:31:55.190]
Toyota Prius 15.

[02:31:55.570 --> 02:31:56.690]
Audi TT 14.

[02:31:57.430 --> 02:31:58.470]
Dodge Neon 14.

[02:31:58.990 --> 02:32:02.570]
And I tell you about those neat little little cabs in Vancouver with the electric car as you said it.

[02:32:03.050 --> 02:32:03.530]
They're great.

[02:32:04.290 --> 02:32:05.150]
Honda Prelude 9.

[02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:06.470]
PT Cruiser 8.

[02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:07.630]
Keep Liberty 8.

[02:32:07.950 --> 02:32:08.710]
Ford S-Q7.

[02:32:09.370 --> 02:32:10.410]
Toyota MR26.

[02:32:11.010 --> 02:32:12.330]
BMW Mini Coupe 5.

[02:32:13.050 --> 02:32:14.330]
Honda 2000 S-4.

[02:32:14.850 --> 02:32:16.130]
Azuzu Impulse 3.

[02:32:16.210 --> 02:32:17.370]
And Subaru Outback 2.

[02:32:18.790 --> 02:32:20.430]
I didn't know if the Outback made a car.

[02:32:21.390 --> 02:32:22.230]
I knew like that.

[02:32:22.330 --> 02:32:23.550]
Walk about soup at the Outback.

[02:32:23.930 --> 02:32:24.710]
Just fine.

[02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.510]
Yes, it's good.

[02:32:26.290 --> 02:32:27.230]
It's really good.

[02:32:30.770 --> 02:32:33.830]
Statutations from a second generation listener made the old bitch rest in peace.

[02:32:33.830 --> 02:32:36.370]
It says, what does that mean?

[02:32:37.770 --> 02:32:38.030]
I don't know.

[02:32:39.590 --> 02:32:40.710]
Good way to clean ear.

[02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:41.830]
Mineral oil.

[02:32:41.910 --> 02:32:43.690]
A few drops and hold it in with cotton balls.

[02:32:43.690 --> 02:32:46.210]
We'll kill and rinse out all the stuff that grows potatoes.

[02:32:47.330 --> 02:32:50.690]
PS, you've been over God for over 25 years.

[02:32:51.050 --> 02:32:51.830]
Damn God.

[02:32:52.030 --> 02:32:54.930]
Which reminds me we got 33 year anniversary coming up on Monday.

[02:32:55.290 --> 02:32:57.870]
It would be on Sunday, March 1, but we're not working on Sunday.

[02:32:59.330 --> 02:33:00.790]
Maybe they'll let us work on Sunday.

[02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:01.190]
What do you think?

[02:33:01.770 --> 02:33:03.470]
If we ask nice and do it for free.

[02:33:03.610 --> 02:33:03.750]
No.

[02:33:04.610 --> 02:33:06.310]
So what should we do on Monday?

[02:33:06.390 --> 02:33:11.450]
Because I'm sure that there'll be like balloons and all kinds of party favors and crap coming up here from right there.

[02:33:11.450 --> 02:33:13.970]
There's just bask in the glory of that.

[02:33:14.210 --> 02:33:17.990]
Drink a lot and eat all the food that they're going to be bringing in to you.

[02:33:23.450 --> 02:33:24.170]
Don't play that.

[02:33:27.150 --> 02:33:28.250]
There might be another one.

[02:33:31.390 --> 02:33:32.190]
Don't say that.

[02:33:41.610 --> 02:33:43.330]
33 years on ear and sound phone.

[02:33:43.330 --> 02:33:44.490]
This is what it's come down to.

[02:33:45.210 --> 02:33:47.770]
Gotta keep bleeping and bleeping and bleeping and editing.

[02:33:50.030 --> 02:33:53.970]
But you know, now that we got the new administration, the FCC is going to really loosen up.

[02:33:54.010 --> 02:33:54.230]
Not.

[02:33:55.230 --> 02:33:55.570]
Not.

[02:33:56.770 --> 02:33:59.950]
See, it's one thing about the world.

[02:34:01.410 --> 02:34:02.630]
It's like a new tax.

[02:34:02.850 --> 02:34:05.510]
Once they had a new tax on, they never take it off.

[02:34:05.750 --> 02:34:06.130]
Right.

[02:34:06.770 --> 02:34:07.110]
Right.

[02:34:07.710 --> 02:34:07.790]
Right.

[02:34:08.050 --> 02:34:11.470]
Oh, the T-bones, by the way, no matter what shape your stomach is in, T-bones.

[02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:14.650]
Oh, not the T-bags.

[02:34:14.850 --> 02:34:16.770]
How about you got it there and you remember the song too.

[02:34:16.930 --> 02:34:17.710]
You got it in your pocket.

[02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:18.790]
T-bones.

[02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:21.010]
No, no matter what shape.

[02:34:21.810 --> 02:34:21.970]
No.

[02:34:22.930 --> 02:34:24.250]
Like T-bones.

[02:34:24.550 --> 02:34:24.770]
That kind of thing.

[02:34:24.810 --> 02:34:24.930]
Right.

[02:34:25.190 --> 02:34:26.070]
T-bones, right.

[02:34:26.390 --> 02:34:27.650]
T-bones, like T-bones, steak.

[02:34:27.850 --> 02:34:28.650]
What's wrong with you, mine?

[02:34:28.650 --> 02:34:29.430]
Never heard of it.

[02:34:29.830 --> 02:34:31.170]
You never heard of what the song?

[02:34:31.810 --> 02:34:32.230]
The song.

[02:34:33.390 --> 02:34:33.910]
Yeah.

[02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:34.830]
See, there you go.

[02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:35.450]
There it is.

[02:34:36.290 --> 02:34:39.090]
You lie and I'm ready to die.

[02:34:39.330 --> 02:34:39.910]
Like a soul bitch.

[02:34:40.830 --> 02:34:41.010]
Yeah.

[02:34:47.130 --> 02:34:48.170]
Uh-oh.

[02:34:49.250 --> 02:34:49.770]
What?

[02:34:51.050 --> 02:34:51.790]
It's global.

[02:34:52.210 --> 02:34:52.730]
Oh.

[02:34:55.270 --> 02:34:55.790]
Oh.

[02:34:58.090 --> 02:34:58.990]
And you remember this?

[02:34:59.230 --> 02:34:59.970]
Of course I do.

[02:35:00.530 --> 02:35:00.650]
Oh.

[02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:05.890]
And it was just a solid for a TV spot for where I'm sure Pepco Bismol.

[02:35:06.090 --> 02:35:06.270]
Right.

[02:35:06.410 --> 02:35:07.250]
Maybe Alchazelser.

[02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:08.970]
I'm thinking Alchazelser.

[02:35:10.370 --> 02:35:13.710]
Boy, it's been many, many years since I ever used Alchazelser.

[02:35:13.790 --> 02:35:14.190]
You use it?

[02:35:14.390 --> 02:35:15.270]
Yeah, I do it like it.

[02:35:15.410 --> 02:35:18.050]
Well, that's because you're always got an upset stomach from all that bad drugs.

[02:35:18.610 --> 02:35:19.230]
That's not what it's from.

[02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:20.190]
No.

[02:35:20.730 --> 02:35:21.590]
From all that, Agita.

[02:35:22.070 --> 02:35:22.550]
That's right.

[02:35:22.750 --> 02:35:23.590]
I got news for you, man.

[02:35:23.590 --> 02:35:25.830]
If you want to share Agita, I got plenty of stories.

[02:35:25.990 --> 02:35:26.930]
I got plenty of Agita here.

[02:35:27.170 --> 02:35:30.650]
I don't share them with you though because then you'll give me a, you know, a bitching out.

[02:35:30.890 --> 02:35:31.930]
No, I won't.

[02:35:31.930 --> 02:35:32.490]
Yeah, you will.

[02:35:32.750 --> 02:35:33.610]
Not like those other guys.

[02:35:34.850 --> 02:35:36.570]
Nothing but my heartfelt sympathies.

[02:35:36.930 --> 02:35:37.490]
Oh, I see.

[02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:41.670]
The T-bones, I no matter what shape.

[02:35:41.890 --> 02:35:43.270]
And then you know something, I had to look it up.

[02:35:43.330 --> 02:35:44.030]
I had to Google it.

[02:35:44.570 --> 02:35:48.030]
You think that this vast audience we got out there with these 80 billion people

[02:35:48.030 --> 02:35:48.690]
where you stay listening.

[02:35:49.050 --> 02:35:50.730]
You think they would have come through with that, but no.

[02:35:51.270 --> 02:35:52.570]
I had to Google it for you.

[02:35:53.090 --> 02:35:54.870]
Oh, the fake Alice Rantell is back.

[02:35:55.010 --> 02:35:55.710]
Who really bugs me?

[02:35:56.110 --> 02:35:58.570]
Listening on my iPhone using U-Tunes.

[02:35:59.070 --> 02:36:00.590]
The streaming is great except you.

[02:36:01.110 --> 02:36:03.270]
Your room has a lot of ambient noise in the background.

[02:36:03.290 --> 02:36:04.490]
I'm eating it Olive Garden.

[02:36:04.990 --> 02:36:06.910]
Overall, food is mediocre, but the soups are great.

[02:36:07.230 --> 02:36:09.010]
And that's a good place for you, Alice, the Olive Garden.

[02:36:10.250 --> 02:36:12.570]
Oh, and my, my outlook expressed.

[02:36:12.750 --> 02:36:13.810]
Now I've got the old shaken bake.

[02:36:15.330 --> 02:36:16.590]
Every once in a while it does that.

[02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:19.570]
The screen just shakes and quakes and...

[02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:23.890]
What causes that?

[02:36:24.690 --> 02:36:28.150]
I mean, you're the great proponent of outlook of stress.

[02:36:28.350 --> 02:36:29.110]
No, I'm not.

[02:36:29.150 --> 02:36:29.530]
Yes, you are.

[02:36:29.530 --> 02:36:30.650]
I'm trying to get you to use another client.

[02:36:30.830 --> 02:36:32.010]
You're the one that's the best.

[02:36:32.010 --> 02:36:34.110]
Forget about Yahoo and forget about Hotmail.

[02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:36.490]
Do we want to talk about what I really said?

[02:36:36.930 --> 02:36:37.350]
You sure?

[02:36:37.690 --> 02:36:39.370]
I said, those are web mails.

[02:36:39.470 --> 02:36:42.550]
You need to use a real email, but there are a variety of clients

[02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:45.270]
and I try to get you to use one, but it didn't work.

[02:36:46.050 --> 02:36:47.710]
No, we tried to set it up, didn't work.

[02:36:48.130 --> 02:36:51.350]
Outlook expresses one of many clients for real email.

[02:36:51.350 --> 02:36:52.270]
It's the worst one.

[02:36:52.450 --> 02:36:53.490]
For the real deal?

[02:36:53.730 --> 02:36:53.830]
Yeah.

[02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.610]
Just have a...

[02:36:54.610 --> 02:36:55.150]
How about the real deal?

[02:36:55.730 --> 02:36:56.470]
The real deal?

[02:36:57.050 --> 02:36:58.110]
Yeah, the real deal deal.

[02:36:58.290 --> 02:36:59.330]
Oh, that's somehow the real deal.

[02:37:00.930 --> 02:37:02.690]
Now let's see if I printed this out of it.

[02:37:02.830 --> 02:37:03.670]
It's not shaking anymore.

[02:37:04.430 --> 02:37:06.690]
I thought maybe when I printed out the paper would shake.

[02:37:08.170 --> 02:37:09.970]
It says, the way you should...

[02:37:09.970 --> 02:37:11.950]
By the way, you should never use Q-tips for cleaning years.

[02:37:12.510 --> 02:37:13.110]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:37:13.370 --> 02:37:15.710]
I used to, and once clogged my eardrum with ear wax,

[02:37:16.090 --> 02:37:18.030]
it ended up getting infected and if you want to know pain,

[02:37:18.190 --> 02:37:18.730]
keep doing it.

[02:37:19.490 --> 02:37:21.890]
Advice for my doctor, take a cotton ball,

[02:37:22.250 --> 02:37:24.690]
make it into a wick, it will not jam the ear wax into your eardrum.

[02:37:26.310 --> 02:37:29.550]
Oh, God, Kevin and Miami says, by the way,

[02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:33.150]
Mrs. Pelosi's breasts look perky, especially in high definition.

[02:37:33.690 --> 02:37:34.590]
Oh, fat.

[02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:36.550]
Oh, fat.

[02:37:37.870 --> 02:37:38.830]
You're a high-dose man.

[02:37:38.970 --> 02:37:40.990]
You guys need some serious assistance.

[02:37:42.410 --> 02:37:43.850]
Anybody that tells me that her...

[02:37:43.850 --> 02:37:45.370]
Any part of her looked sexy.

[02:37:45.670 --> 02:37:46.370]
Good, God.

[02:37:46.370 --> 02:37:49.490]
I wouldn't touch her with your armpit.

[02:37:50.630 --> 02:37:52.230]
God, is that pathetic or what?

[02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:53.250]
Yeah.

[02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:56.370]
It's like you, you know, anything with a screw on it.

[02:37:57.010 --> 02:37:57.450]
That's right.

[02:37:57.490 --> 02:37:57.790]
Like that.

[02:37:57.850 --> 02:37:58.170]
There you go.

[02:37:59.070 --> 02:37:59.870]
Well, we know that.

[02:38:00.150 --> 02:38:00.470]
Sure.

[02:38:00.970 --> 02:38:02.070]
Especially in that building there.

[02:38:02.290 --> 02:38:02.750]
That's right.

[02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:03.110]
Anybody?

[02:38:03.730 --> 02:38:06.030]
You folks should have seen what we had that...

[02:38:07.890 --> 02:38:08.610]
What was your name?

[02:38:09.070 --> 02:38:09.510]
What was your name?

[02:38:11.430 --> 02:38:11.890]
Like what?

[02:38:11.930 --> 02:38:14.450]
The young lady that used to have bending down on the cabinet all the time.

[02:38:14.570 --> 02:38:14.830]
Shannon?

[02:38:15.210 --> 02:38:16.110]
Shannon, that's right.

[02:38:16.290 --> 02:38:16.830]
You know the one.

[02:38:16.890 --> 02:38:17.450]
She was beautiful.

[02:38:18.090 --> 02:38:19.010]
She was beautiful.

[02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:20.330]
And she was a very nice person, too.

[02:38:21.210 --> 02:38:22.470]
See, there's the young lady I like.

[02:38:22.750 --> 02:38:22.910]
A lot.

[02:38:25.130 --> 02:38:28.270]
And she actually paid a little attention to the show when you weren't chasing her around

[02:38:28.270 --> 02:38:29.250]
and having her bend down.

[02:38:30.190 --> 02:38:31.630]
She paid a lot of attention to everything.

[02:38:33.710 --> 02:38:34.070]
Oh.

[02:38:34.730 --> 02:38:36.990]
All he ever wanted to do was bend down in that cabinet.

[02:38:37.130 --> 02:38:38.470]
Oh, it's down there on a bottom shelf.

[02:38:38.890 --> 02:38:38.890]

[02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:40.970]
Well, I mean, for starters.

[02:38:40.970 --> 02:38:43.550]
Neon God.

[02:39:41.770 --> 02:39:43.250]
Bow right for Mama.

[02:39:43.830 --> 02:39:45.450]
And for the black band out.

[02:39:45.570 --> 02:39:46.930]
Be the low white.

[02:39:48.270 --> 02:39:48.710]
House.

[02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:52.510]
Yeah, mother and law is moving into.

[02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:53.390]
Buracco.

[02:39:53.450 --> 02:39:54.190]
Sorry for you.

[02:39:57.670 --> 02:39:58.110]
146.

[02:39:58.110 --> 02:40:00.750]
He made one of the great speeches in the history of the human race last night.

[02:40:00.910 --> 02:40:03.870]
And our audience, they're concerned about Nancy Pelosi and her jiggling breasts.

[02:40:04.110 --> 02:40:05.450]
Oh, my God.

[02:40:05.590 --> 02:40:07.050]
Time to get your priorities, it order, mister.

[02:40:08.930 --> 02:40:10.050]
I'm going to tell you something.

[02:40:10.230 --> 02:40:15.970]
The day that you start ooling about her breasts will be the day we get you checked in.

[02:40:16.210 --> 02:40:18.650]
If I didn't set off your sarcasm meter there, you need to get it fixed.

[02:40:20.890 --> 02:40:21.610]
Buga, Buga.

[02:40:22.370 --> 02:40:23.250]
How's that horse doing?

[02:40:23.410 --> 02:40:23.810]
Oh, here he comes.

[02:40:24.290 --> 02:40:25.030]
Here he comes.

[02:40:25.030 --> 02:40:27.570]
He's in mid stretch, puking his lungs.

[02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:30.250]
21 votes on the new pool.

[02:40:31.350 --> 02:40:33.210]
What minor injury is the most painful?

[02:40:33.650 --> 02:40:34.830]
Punched into balls 12.

[02:40:35.690 --> 02:40:36.810]
Paper cut four.

[02:40:37.630 --> 02:40:38.470]
Stubbed toe two.

[02:40:39.030 --> 02:40:39.950]
Banged elbow two.

[02:40:40.310 --> 02:40:41.110]
Poked in the eye one.

[02:40:41.630 --> 02:40:42.970]
And none cut by shaving.

[02:40:43.370 --> 02:40:44.350]
Bumping your head on something.

[02:40:44.750 --> 02:40:46.850]
Ice cream headache or kicked in the shin.

[02:40:47.270 --> 02:40:47.950]
None for those yet.

[02:40:48.090 --> 02:40:48.830]
But there will be.

[02:40:49.710 --> 02:40:50.450]
Nice going, era.

[02:40:50.630 --> 02:40:51.290]
What's your brand?

[02:40:51.790 --> 02:40:52.670]
What's your name?

[02:40:53.630 --> 02:40:53.990]
Oh.

[02:40:55.470 --> 02:40:56.690]
Oh, let's see.

[02:40:56.810 --> 02:41:00.350]
The work they always seems to drag by a little whenever you're away, Neil.

[02:41:00.850 --> 02:41:01.370]
Says somebody.

[02:41:02.590 --> 02:41:04.990]
George, an exceptional job, as usual.

[02:41:05.910 --> 02:41:13.630]
When I listen to his show, I feel like I'm back in high school at the back of study hall, talking with my homeboys.

[02:41:14.770 --> 02:41:16.170]
I have one problem with George.

[02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:18.030]
He's a music snob.

[02:41:18.930 --> 02:41:20.230]
What is a music snob?

[02:41:20.330 --> 02:41:28.650]
It says a music snob is someone who thinks that they are so cool that they're the only ones who know what type of music is cool.

[02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:30.750]
Music is very subjective thing.

[02:41:31.690 --> 02:41:33.290]
So stick to talk, George.

[02:41:34.150 --> 02:41:35.230]
Hope you had a great vacation, Neil.

[02:41:35.230 --> 02:41:36.030]
The fake a rod.

[02:41:36.230 --> 02:41:36.990]
Oh, thanks, a rod.

[02:41:37.570 --> 02:41:38.490]
So stick to talk.

[02:41:38.890 --> 02:41:40.290]
What's picking a stick into talk?

[02:41:40.610 --> 02:41:42.170]
Where's this idiotic email I got?

[02:41:43.330 --> 02:41:43.730]
Really?

[02:41:43.870 --> 02:41:44.670]
You got an idiotic email?

[02:41:44.770 --> 02:41:45.130]
Oh, yeah.

[02:41:45.130 --> 02:41:45.450]
I don't know.

[02:41:45.490 --> 02:41:47.450]
From Chef Sparky, who's a real idiot.

[02:41:48.530 --> 02:41:49.910]
Who works across the street.

[02:41:49.990 --> 02:41:50.330]
No doubt.

[02:41:51.890 --> 02:41:52.810]
Neither of either.

[02:41:53.230 --> 02:41:56.650]
Neil has either of you heard anything about the rumor that seven-and-a-s dropping the sports format.

[02:41:57.130 --> 02:42:00.490]
So encouraged by LeBaster's ratings, they're moving to a general talk format.

[02:42:01.270 --> 02:42:03.790]
LeBaster talks about anything the other day he discussed Bailwoll.

[02:42:03.950 --> 02:42:04.370]
Very funny.

[02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:06.790]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

[02:42:08.550 --> 02:42:10.650]
No, I haven't heard anything about the rumor that you want to start.

[02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:11.390]
Chef Sparky.

[02:42:12.750 --> 02:42:15.490]
Chef Sparky wants to start a rumor about how they're going general talk.

[02:42:15.770 --> 02:42:17.070]
And who are they going to put on here to do it?

[02:42:17.610 --> 02:42:18.730]
The losers they got on there now.

[02:42:20.110 --> 02:42:22.150]
As far as drafting the sports format is concerned.

[02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:27.970]
There'll be a lot of people who will advise to think about doing that, but they don't want to.

[02:42:28.290 --> 02:42:29.070]
What do I mean?

[02:42:29.330 --> 02:42:29.570]
I do.

[02:42:29.950 --> 02:42:30.830]
They don't want to.

[02:42:32.250 --> 02:42:33.030]
Look at that.

[02:42:33.170 --> 02:42:35.050]
It's plus one tomorrow, plus three.

[02:42:35.850 --> 02:42:37.310]
You know, plus five tomorrow.

[02:42:37.690 --> 02:42:39.810]
And Saturday, Sunday and only minus three.

[02:42:40.350 --> 02:42:41.510]
Spring is in the year, baby.

[02:42:41.650 --> 02:42:44.410]
And there's no snow on the ground for Castanova.

[02:42:46.390 --> 02:42:49.410]
Although Monday, minus six, cool Tuesday, minus one.

[02:42:49.410 --> 02:42:51.530]
Not so spring-like if he asked me.

[02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:54.670]
Damn stinkin' wintertime, sucks.

[02:42:55.990 --> 02:42:57.430]
Not that I'm complaining, you understand?

[02:42:57.650 --> 02:43:00.190]
I'd rather be here than a lot of other places I can think of like there.

[02:43:01.010 --> 02:43:01.770]
Oh, you're wrong.

[02:43:02.110 --> 02:43:04.150]
Neil Brickle is just really coming alive.

[02:43:04.370 --> 02:43:04.810]
Yeah, okay.

[02:43:06.890 --> 02:43:07.710]
Good luck to you.

[02:43:07.790 --> 02:43:08.530]
Have a great time there.

[02:43:09.210 --> 02:43:10.730]
Have a party in your pants, I'm Brickle.

[02:43:12.390 --> 02:43:16.470]
Gary says, hey, Neil and George, first time emailer, don't worry, I won't abuse it.

[02:43:17.070 --> 02:43:20.990]
I just got back from lunch at Taco Bell and something there compelled me to write to you.

[02:43:21.950 --> 02:43:26.190]
I was earning my Chalupa and when I went to pay there near the register was a tip cup

[02:43:26.190 --> 02:43:28.210]
with a couple of dollars and some mixed change.

[02:43:29.170 --> 02:43:29.850]
A tip cup.

[02:43:30.810 --> 02:43:33.370]
I can understand tipping in a restaurant but at a fast food chain?

[02:43:33.730 --> 02:43:35.910]
Yes, everywhere you're supposed to leave a few pennies.

[02:43:36.330 --> 02:43:37.030]
In today's economy.

[02:43:37.630 --> 02:43:38.250]
It's true.

[02:43:39.470 --> 02:43:40.250]
This is ridiculous.

[02:43:40.470 --> 02:43:41.290]
Where will the line be drawn?

[02:43:41.290 --> 02:43:45.470]
It makes me mad enough to see these in Dunkin' Donuts when they pour my coffee and grab me a blueberry muffin.

[02:43:45.470 --> 02:43:47.870]
But Taco Frigel Bell?

[02:43:49.610 --> 02:43:51.490]
That's right, you better watch your free goal, Mr.

[02:43:52.330 --> 02:43:53.890]
You ever have the Frigel bar in a hotel?

[02:43:54.270 --> 02:43:54.690]
Just this morning.

[02:43:54.930 --> 02:43:58.050]
Anyway, just this morning, there goes with that again, see, just this morning.

[02:43:59.270 --> 02:44:01.650]
Somebody's going to take a ball peeing hammer to you one of these days.

[02:44:02.410 --> 02:44:04.610]
Anyway, just that you might like to know, additionally, George is awesome.

[02:44:04.710 --> 02:44:07.570]
I listen every chance when he's on, I get his Gary.

[02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:08.470]
Thanks, Gary.

[02:44:08.590 --> 02:44:09.750]
Listen to every chance when you're on.

[02:44:10.810 --> 02:44:11.830]
Then even when you're not on.

[02:44:12.570 --> 02:44:14.610]
Even when neither one of us is on, Carula.

[02:44:14.970 --> 02:44:18.110]
Listen, just if you don't want to leave the tip money in there, don't leave it.

[02:44:18.250 --> 02:44:19.170]
It's just like it would buy.

[02:44:19.450 --> 02:44:20.310]
I'm very generous.

[02:44:20.450 --> 02:44:25.590]
They love me there because when they bring my diet soda's by, I leave something on the tray.

[02:44:26.770 --> 02:44:30.110]
Either a loony, a toony, or whatever, or three, four quarters, something.

[02:44:30.370 --> 02:44:30.870]
Money, why do you?

[02:44:31.310 --> 02:44:32.110]
Well, why not?

[02:44:33.190 --> 02:44:34.730]
I mean, I'm sitting there punching my guts out.

[02:44:34.830 --> 02:44:38.470]
The least I can do for the good service they give me is leave them a few shekels for Christ's sakes.

[02:44:38.890 --> 02:44:40.310]
You are definitely cheap, Gary.

[02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:40.630]
What?

[02:44:40.630 --> 02:44:43.510]
You're definitely supposed to tip there when somebody brings you something.

[02:44:43.730 --> 02:44:44.090]
Right.

[02:44:44.350 --> 02:44:46.270]
Nothing to do with his taco bell thing there.

[02:44:47.410 --> 02:44:49.750]
If you don't like taco smell, don't smell it.

[02:44:51.390 --> 02:44:57.010]
Nadia Suleiman is getting offered a $1 million contract from Vivint Entertainment with Full Medical Coverage, says a Gabriel.

[02:44:57.570 --> 02:45:00.590]
The same people who were asking for bailout money or offering money to Octo Mom.

[02:45:01.050 --> 02:45:02.050]
This is why we're in a recession.

[02:45:03.070 --> 02:45:04.390]
Neil, your show gets better every day.

[02:45:04.470 --> 02:45:05.950]
All those fat shut-ins need to get alive.

[02:45:06.270 --> 02:45:07.490]
And if they don't like it, stop listening.

[02:45:07.630 --> 02:45:07.970]
That's right.

[02:45:09.030 --> 02:45:09.430]
Stop.

[02:45:10.650 --> 02:45:12.650]
Including that the schlub, what's his name?

[02:45:13.590 --> 02:45:14.270]
Which one?

[02:45:15.070 --> 02:45:15.790]
Which name?

[02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:17.650]
Whatever name he's got.

[02:45:18.770 --> 02:45:22.350]
Morning, morning train, morning train, Shmendrick, Mr. Tuchu.

[02:45:22.930 --> 02:45:24.630]
Well, of course, Mr. Tuchu.

[02:45:24.770 --> 02:45:25.270]
That's him.

[02:45:27.230 --> 02:45:29.550]
Brandon says, I have a small comment on Q-tips.

[02:45:30.130 --> 02:45:31.650]
For me, I love cleaning my ears.

[02:45:33.330 --> 02:45:37.210]
You know how sometimes you'll scratch your dog in a certain place and his leg might twitch from the nice feeling?

[02:45:37.450 --> 02:45:37.650]
Yes.

[02:45:37.650 --> 02:45:38.230]
That's his Brandon.

[02:45:38.770 --> 02:45:41.030]
I get the same way by clearing my ear with a Q-tip.

[02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:46.010]
I get weak in the knees, and like I'm on the verge of having a moment in my pants that like three now?

[02:45:46.370 --> 02:45:46.910]
That upset that?

[02:45:47.230 --> 02:45:48.190]
Yeah, I'm doing it wrong.

[02:45:48.850 --> 02:45:49.570]
That's why I like George.

[02:45:49.570 --> 02:45:50.930]
I clean my ears at least once a day.

[02:45:51.050 --> 02:45:51.470]
He says Brandon.

[02:45:52.410 --> 02:45:54.510]
He's got, he's close to having a moment in his pants.

[02:45:55.130 --> 02:45:56.330]
I'm totally doing it wrong.

[02:45:56.830 --> 02:45:57.770]
I guess so.

[02:45:58.630 --> 02:46:00.210]
I never had a Q-tip moment in my pants.

[02:46:00.610 --> 02:46:03.570]
Although I do have my pantaloonies on right now and my shoes and my shirt.

[02:46:04.990 --> 02:46:05.610]
Another exciting?

[02:46:05.610 --> 02:46:10.630]
I mean, not as exciting as you know being in the car already and on the way.

[02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:12.750]
But when you're mailing it in.

[02:46:15.050 --> 02:46:16.770]
Oh, here's one about ass Wednesday.

[02:46:17.130 --> 02:46:18.090]
An honor of ass Wednesday.

[02:46:18.170 --> 02:46:20.830]
Could you play all you can eat Negro, Barbara and Ray and Sunrise.

[02:46:20.970 --> 02:46:23.710]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, got the time.

[02:46:23.730 --> 02:46:24.890]
See, now they ask for that.

[02:46:24.910 --> 02:46:26.550]
See, that would have killed some great time, wouldn't it?

[02:46:27.610 --> 02:46:27.810]
Sure.

[02:46:28.430 --> 02:46:31.070]
Neil, at E&C, they sell these things called ear candles.

[02:46:31.250 --> 02:46:33.050]
You stick them all on out with that again.

[02:46:33.450 --> 02:46:33.770]
What?

[02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:34.990]
It's quacker-y, man.

[02:46:36.070 --> 02:46:36.910]
We went through that.

[02:46:36.950 --> 02:46:39.990]
Remember Rick Riley brought in a bunch of those things years ago?

[02:46:40.370 --> 02:46:40.930]
Ear candles?

[02:46:42.250 --> 02:46:43.470]
For lack of a better term.

[02:46:43.490 --> 02:46:44.370]
Is that like eye candy?

[02:46:44.590 --> 02:46:45.050]
Yeah, no.

[02:46:45.590 --> 02:46:46.550]
Is that like eye poppy?

[02:46:46.930 --> 02:46:47.570]
That's what it is.

[02:46:48.650 --> 02:46:49.770]
Quacker-y is what it is.

[02:46:49.790 --> 02:46:50.410]
Well, what is it?

[02:46:50.830 --> 02:46:54.490]
There are these wax tubes, these paper with wax on the tube.

[02:46:54.910 --> 02:46:55.270]
Yeah.

[02:46:55.390 --> 02:46:57.950]
You're supposed to stick them in the ear and set fire to them.

[02:46:59.150 --> 02:46:59.610]
And the...

[02:46:59.610 --> 02:47:00.510]
And what is it supposed to do?

[02:47:00.690 --> 02:47:02.610]
It's supposed to draw the wax out of your ear.

[02:47:02.710 --> 02:47:04.510]
But really, it's just the wax on the paper, the dripping.

[02:47:04.510 --> 02:47:08.830]
So people think it's like those foot pads that leech the chemicals out of your body.

[02:47:08.830 --> 02:47:10.070]
It's that kind of quacker-y.

[02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.410]
Oh, yeah.

[02:47:11.430 --> 02:47:14.630]
Neil Rogers got new from the makers of Tic Tacs.

[02:47:14.710 --> 02:47:17.150]
An association with antibiotics anytime enterprises.

[02:47:17.410 --> 02:47:20.410]
It's the new A-Rod Tic Tacs.

[02:47:20.430 --> 02:47:22.490]
A-Rod Tic Tacs.

[02:47:22.570 --> 02:47:24.290]
You're the whole world in that device.

[02:47:24.610 --> 02:47:25.010]
Hey, Dad.

[02:47:25.330 --> 02:47:27.330]
I've been taking the new A-Rod Tic Tacs.

[02:47:27.410 --> 02:47:28.790]
I can't wait to little exarts.

[02:47:29.530 --> 02:47:32.330]
We got those from our cousin in the Dominican Republic.

[02:47:32.810 --> 02:47:33.710]
Don't tell the other kids.

[02:47:33.710 --> 02:47:35.130]
Oh, okay.

[02:47:35.150 --> 02:47:36.710]
So it's a big secret, then?

[02:47:37.010 --> 02:47:38.470]
Yeah, it's a big secret.

[02:47:39.530 --> 02:47:40.010]
So...

[02:47:40.010 --> 02:47:42.790]
Give me a new Xbox 360 there.

[02:47:43.030 --> 02:47:43.510]
What?

[02:47:44.050 --> 02:47:45.170]
Do it, you old sail.

[02:47:45.650 --> 02:47:46.650]
Don't make me angry.

[02:47:47.050 --> 02:47:48.510]
He will want me in the ass.

[02:47:48.830 --> 02:47:48.990]
Yeah.

[02:47:49.970 --> 02:47:51.770]
Okay, okay, whatever you say, Dad.

[02:47:53.410 --> 02:47:55.630]
A-Rod Tic Tacs.

[02:47:55.650 --> 02:47:57.430]
You're the whole world in that device.

[02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:58.710]
A-Rod Tic Tacs.

[02:47:59.310 --> 02:48:02.610]
Available now from a guy in the locker room of your local gym.

[02:48:02.610 --> 02:48:04.630]
But don't tell anybody.

[02:48:04.710 --> 02:48:05.970]
Don't show any work.

[02:48:08.450 --> 02:48:10.270]
Oh, that sounded like the...

[02:48:10.270 --> 02:48:11.090]
Great, but...

[02:48:11.610 --> 02:48:14.570]
Neil Rogers is on South Florida Sports Leader.

[02:48:15.030 --> 02:48:16.730]
560 QAM.

[02:48:17.570 --> 02:48:18.450]
Shero's morning.

[02:48:18.510 --> 02:48:19.330]
Oh, my God.

[02:48:19.330 --> 02:48:20.530]
Sponged in Mandage after news.

[02:48:20.810 --> 02:48:23.830]
Spine to win my new home of the Miami Dolphin.

[02:48:24.130 --> 02:48:25.110]
Touchdown Dolphin.

[02:48:25.210 --> 02:48:27.230]
Is this South Florida sports leader?

[02:48:27.670 --> 02:48:28.230]
Oh, my God.

[02:48:28.490 --> 02:48:29.990]
560 QAM.

[02:48:31.510 --> 02:48:35.030]
It's day in Miami Town.

[02:48:35.410 --> 02:48:39.770]
At 560 WQ-Ed.

[02:48:49.990 --> 02:48:57.910]
When the sun beats down and burns the top of my head.

[02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:03.390]
And when my employees laugh at me.

[02:49:04.050 --> 02:49:06.670]
I wish I were dead.

[02:49:08.050 --> 02:49:11.470]
I've got balls, five.

[02:49:12.970 --> 02:49:17.430]
And top of me, yeah.

[02:49:18.170 --> 02:49:22.250]
Should I paint it, plant it, or cover it?

[02:49:22.430 --> 02:49:24.130]
It's all up to me.

[02:49:24.410 --> 02:49:26.110]
All up to you.

[02:49:27.170 --> 02:49:29.170]
He's got a ball spot.

[02:49:29.550 --> 02:49:32.130]
Just like a billion balls.

[02:49:32.410 --> 02:49:33.770]
He's got a ball spot.

[02:49:34.270 --> 02:49:36.610]
I feel three inches tall.

[02:49:37.010 --> 02:49:38.370]
He's got a ball spot.

[02:49:38.790 --> 02:49:40.270]
Please help me run.

[02:49:40.490 --> 02:49:40.950]
Bo-P.

[02:49:41.370 --> 02:49:42.850]
He's got a ball spot.

[02:49:43.430 --> 02:49:45.630]
I know how Larry King feels.

[02:49:45.990 --> 02:49:47.510]
He's got a ball spot.

[02:49:48.570 --> 02:49:49.250]
Ball spot.

[02:49:50.330 --> 02:49:53.970]
Oh, when I painted my head, my wife, she said.

[02:49:53.970 --> 02:49:57.110]
She's out of here.

[02:49:59.130 --> 02:50:05.830]
And when I go to the John the Guise are using my head for a mirror.

[02:50:07.810 --> 02:50:11.750]
I've got a ball spot.

[02:50:12.730 --> 02:50:17.230]
And top of me, yeah.

[02:50:18.010 --> 02:50:21.810]
Should I paint it, plant it, or cover it?

[02:50:21.810 --> 02:50:23.890]
It's all up to me.

[02:50:23.890 --> 02:50:25.770]
All up to you.

[02:50:26.330 --> 02:50:27.310]
You're fairies.

[02:50:27.490 --> 02:50:28.970]
He's got a ball spot.

[02:50:29.450 --> 02:50:31.670]
Just like a billion balls.

[02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:33.450]
He's got a ball spot.

[02:50:34.090 --> 02:50:36.250]
I feel three inches tall.

[02:50:36.570 --> 02:50:38.170]
He's got a ball spot.

[02:50:38.670 --> 02:50:40.110]

He's got a ball spot.

[02:50:43.250 --> 02:50:45.490]
I know how Larry King feels.

[02:50:45.790 --> 02:50:47.310]
He's got a ball spot.

[02:50:48.310 --> 02:50:48.950]
Ball spot.

[02:50:48.950 --> 02:50:49.250]
Ball spot.

[02:50:49.290 --> 02:50:49.930]
Ball spot.
