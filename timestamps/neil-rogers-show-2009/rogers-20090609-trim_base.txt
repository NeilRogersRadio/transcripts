Fourth, fourth, sixth, fourth, eighth, thirthough.

[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.240]
Leave volume.

[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.560]

[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.280]

[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.280]

[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.440]
that one email that I read to you now that's got to be the most bizarre thing I've ever gotten in my life in my life I

[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.880]
agree we'll get to it in a second but here's another one that just came in from Tim in Miami I don't want to start because yesterday

[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.300]
we had some serious technical difficulties and God only knows what's gonna happen today let me just punch up a line

[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.240]
wait a minute

[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.800]
QAM hello

[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.300]
Hello yes sir

[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.600]
Yes, it's a man here. Yes sounds like you

[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.180]
Okay, he was on a year for like a second. I guess maybe who's a line checker

[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.040]
Sounded okay though. Yeah sounded better and a lot of the crap we had yesterday

[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.960]
Well, he had some technical problems with the phone the signal was not so great yesterday

[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.460]
I'm wondering and how you said it's improved today. It sounded okay this morning coming in yeah

[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.460]
Tim in Miami says I apologize in advance if you cover this I didn't have the opportunity to listen to any radio programming yesterday

[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.960]
Is it just my radios, but what's up with the signal fading in and out?

[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.520]
It's like a washing machine on the general setting. Well, thank God. It's not on on a high cook, you know

[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.520]
It makes listening difficult if it's my radios ugly by another don't waste the money Tim. It's not your radio

[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.520]
I even had to go so far as tuning W.I.O.D for noise masking while I tried to sleep tonight

[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:44.060]
Imagine my horror finding Jimmy Cifilis starts to show at 5 a.m. Oh my god. Can you imagine his horror finding out that Jimmy Cifilis

[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.440]
No starts at 5 a.m. I can't even begin to imagine it Tim

[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.040]
No, it's not your radio don't go out and buy a new one. We got issues. Okay. Our signal is deteriorating rapidly like everything else in this place

[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.400]
deteriorating rapidly now

[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.880]
Imagine my amazement when I come in this room last night to check some stuff

[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.300]
Mm-hmm

[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.140]
And I look on the emails and here is one

[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.360]
Perhaps the most bizarre the most

[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.420]
I don't know what word to this used to describe it

[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.960]
821 p.m.

[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:24.280]
From a guy named John Maynilly subject your ratings now. I had never heard of John Maynilly. No mean either

[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.920]
I mean, excuse me for my naivete. I mean, I'm supposed to be a big radio maven and know all these important consultants water Sabo

[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.960]
We know as clown

[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.700]
But John Maynilly makes water Sabo seem like a radio genius by comparison

[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.240]
I'm going to read this slowly and deliberately

[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.700]
And keep in mind. This is not somebody I know somebody I ever heard of somebody. I've had any contact within my life

[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.940]
Neil you're too old-rich and arrogant to care

[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.440]
But this might matter to the young guys on your show will be unemployed soon the young guys

[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.220]
There's only one guy on the show and that's flea and his employment has got nothing to do with the show

[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.100]
He's doing the show gratis

[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.620]
The simple reason that you now have a 0.4 share is that no one wants to hear a jaded cynic read countless news articles

[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.260]
Rapidly and without even an inflection or interpretation

[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.060]
To fill time between 20 to 24 minutes of commercials per hour. You can't even be bothered to take phone calls anymore

[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.700]
But we just took one

[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.160]
Mm-hmm, and we don't have 20 to 24 minutes of spots

[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.600]
We have this is the only show on the radio station. It's got in the contract limited to 60 minutes of spots per hour four four minute breaks

[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.500]
But John's an expert on this show. I don't even know this guy. I have no idea who he is other than I googled him and he's a consultant

[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.840]
Here comes the great part you got high ratings with the former honor system diary method because your handful of listeners

[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.780]
claim they listen to every hour of your show all week my handful

[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.300]
They must have been the most powerful handful because when we had the diaries they changed every week

[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.320]
Every rating book was 12 weeks and each week they would change the sample different people had the diaries for only one week

[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.620]
Right

[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.760]
So amazing that my handful of listeners were able to control for 30 plus years

[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.700]
shocking

[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.760]
The new method of course records only actual listening john says

[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.500]
You Steve doll opian Anthony Tomlake is another once great talents who are content to cruise on fumes for the last several years

[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.360]
God will you deserve for the new system?

[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.420]
Enjoy your money in solitude, but remember that these days the new or re-sharad diamond doesn't

[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.820]
john main ellie new york city p.s

[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.220]
Leave it to abesely to think that your ratings crash lies within an under sampling of men 25 to 35

[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.420]
So what was the excuse last time when you had even less a 0.2

[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.160]
The last time we had a 1.3 which is still an embarrassing number

[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.260]
But you know we went from a point two to a point four to 1.3 in this new system

[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.600]
With this great panel

[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.320]
Are keeping my this this is from somebody. I don't know. I have nothing to do with

[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.320]
But he's a consultant, okay?

[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.060]
Does the name joe bell bring a bell with you come to mind when you hear about radio consultants

[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.900]
We have consultants and we got ding dong school and we're gonna do this

[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.840]
And never anything specific never anything constructive. I sent you a bell in email last night

[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.520]
In reference to this and saying that you know all it's been as negative just one negative after another

[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.920]
There's nothing constructive. There's there's oh, well. We know how to deal. We have people who know how to deal with a new system

[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.640]
About the rating system. Yeah. Well, what's the secret? Well, it's like you know who's behind door number one

[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.720]
Like dealer no deal you know what I'm saying?

[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.460]
Don't you find this to be just bizarre and explicable to see mail it is strange

[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:50.760]
I mean, I could understand if it came from some anonymous goofball listener out there that would be you know typical

[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.980]
But coming from a guy and I googled him broadcast media consultant and contractor greater New York City area

[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:05.000]
And his past experience talk radio TV consultant program director New York WFNY FM

[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:14.100]
Inhouse talents got W any WFM New York media reporter New York post program director W. O R New York W ABC in their talk reformat

[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.140]
Never on the air by the way another consultant who's never been on the air

[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.320]
Newswriter editor in LA San Francisco Boise Idaho

[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.820]
anchor producer WFLATV Tampa St. Pete

[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.440]
But never on the year but a consultant he can't do it, but he can tell everybody else how to do it

[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.800]
I'm too old rich and arrogant to care

[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.040]
But all you young guys on to show you better watch it. You're all going to be unemployed soon. Our big staff

[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:53.000]
Reading these countless news articles rapidly without even inflection interpretation. I guess John must be a glued online listening. I guess

[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.400]
often

[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.680]
Although he better start recounting the commercial load

[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.980]
And if he was listening yesterday would discover we took quite a few calls even in spite of the fact that the phone is

[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.900]
All screwed up. Yeah, WQ AM. Hello

[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:09.980]
Oh

[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.860]
Not blind Mike please cracker please

[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.080]
Look out now Q.A.M. Hello

[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.240]
Hello, yeah, you're back at the beach. Hold on a minute. Start recounting with commercial load

[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.820]
And if he was listening yesterday, it sounds really good

[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:36.100]
Well, what did he say? I couldn't understand where he said he said you're back at the beach. No

[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.160]
What does that mean the ocean waves behind you? Oh

[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:47.080]
Really I didn't hear any ocean waves. It sounded like hell of a lot better than that thing we heard yesterday. Oh, yeah

[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.960]
That sounded really really bad

[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.300]
Now let's let's see if this phone thing is working now

[00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:01.500]
So you're telling me lines one through six are the toll-free lines. So like people how far does that extend like 15 miles or something?

[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.660]
That I don't know

[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.240]
Definitely not out of Florida

[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.760]
That I know for sure because we already been through this once before

[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.560]
Now let me let me Q.A.M. Hello

[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:24.920]
Hello, yes, what what number are you calling sir? Huh? Are you calling the toll-free number the 877 number? Yeah, oh, okay

[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:31.800]
Yeah, what do you got? I'm made in my hand the radio sounds kind of so good

[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.640]
But sort of that guy's please that guy you don't pay that for

[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.100]
Yeah

[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:43.920]
Well, maybe he's underwater too maybe we're on the Titanic ready to hit the ocean floor that could be it. I sure feel like it many days

[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.440]
John Maynellie consultant in New York

[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.060]
Who writes to me a scathing

[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.960]
Now the this thing about you got high ratings with a former honor system diary method

[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.540]
It's just amusing to me. It's like saying oh when you never went any good anyway

[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:04.380]
You never really had an audience who was just fanted because of the diaries just all wired diaries every month of every book for 30 plus years

[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.860]
Wow talk about good luck

[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.300]
Even it would buy an I never had luck like that

[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.820]
Even unzated during that morning show when we kicked everybody's ass in the morning

[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.580]
For a year and you can go back and look at those numbers. They must have all been wired diaries

[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.480]
We know how to play the diary game Neil, but now we have to learn to play the new system. Yeah

[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:26.580]
I

[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.340]
Talk about people thrashing about

[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:36.220]
I mean seriously if you if you want to say goodbye to somebody just say goodbye, right? Yeah

[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:41.160]
Work out some kind of a deal and say goodbye without going through all of this angst and grief and BS

[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.020]
Surras

[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:49.880]
But these people can't do that they have to play this agony game. How much can he endure? Well, I think you'll be really surprised

[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:57.320]
If I've endured 33 years in this market working for some real bozos along the way, I can endure quite a bit

[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.320]
And you'll notice that I do show up here every morning. Yep

[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.660]
They're set for Friday when I could have probably closed the 3-and-a-half noon

[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.180]
I still can't believe you said that on the air

[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.920]
See it's it's one thing if you believe that which I told you this morning you're wrong

[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.160]
It had to do with the lawyer's schedule

[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.320]
For the closing

[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.860]
But nevertheless it one thing if you believe it but to say it on the air actually sounds like I don't know not good

[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.000]
Why did you do it? It was just a fleeting comment. I didn't make a big deal out of it. A fleeting comment. Yeah

[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.380]
That would be like if I said well here the flea beats his wife, but anyway moving on wow just a

[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.060]
I don't see the comparison, but okay

[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.020]
Well, no, but I mean just a fleeting comment sure

[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.640]
This one is pretty interesting too, but I better do the break because we got our 45 minutes of spots

[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.780]
I'm just gonna read a bunch of and I'm gonna inflict hey everybody

[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.280]
And puke maybe I can do a puke thing you know

[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.740]
Enough of the puke can already okay without any inflection or

[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.000]
Interpretation and just reading a bunch of boring stories. That's right. That's all I do John main Ellie

[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.480]
I wouldn't be surprised if he and Joe Bell are doing something

[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.440]
Prominents after ten and five sixty WQM yeah, kid baby

[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.160]
Stern gets John main Ellie fired

[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:31.640]
The thing time just sent me to see me you'll find it most amazing. I took a call for the bonnets

[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:37.140]
They say the future beat right for me now again gets no job

[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.780]
Because I don't got no literacy

[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.600]
I was talking like an old me grow

[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.780]
If I had to start the house this way now I can't do nothing

[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.800]
But my heritage say that's okay

[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:56.180]
Change my name to shoot road drive a doosa in the quarter any Cadillac

[00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:06.980]

[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.700]
Learning what a boy is song

[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:49.780]
Ibonics makes me sound funny got nothing to do with literacy now I got to make more money

[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:55.500]
Never food sounds good to me. I got plenty of nothing

[00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:03.420]
Ibonics ain't getting me anywhere maybe I'll mug an old white bitch steal the purse and pull her hair

[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:08.540]
Then I gonna take some money my isario and a frigid dad

Grind the blues about all the teeth white there was got snow job for the

1019 at 560 wcms. I guess Howard's listeners know who um John main Ellie is

[00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.160]
Because I've gotten three or four different emails about him okay

[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.860]
I think this one summarizes it all best. It's his Howard Stern gets post to toss a critic

[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.260]
September 25 2006

[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:14.760]
Tag this story with bad idea John main Ellie went up against the king of all media by publishing a column in the New York post

[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:19.040]
It claimed Howard would leave his five-dimets serious and return to the yoke and harness of terrestrial radio

[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.620]
Not a big deal so far radar online said John was just passing on a rumor

[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.140]
That's true in a way, but not

[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.480]
The here's the whole story away

[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.540]
Here's the whole story at least the tasty parts of it it says

[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.500]
Though main Ellie was merely picking up a report from inside radio and industry trade

[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:41.980]
Stern chose to blast him rather than the source probably because main Ellie spiced up his story with another with other

[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.140]
Damaging details such as a rumor that Stern was having trouble booking high profile guests

[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.740]
And it lost popularity as an internet search term

[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.840]
Stern's Howard 100 news team called attention to main Ellie's consulting ties on air

[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.780]
And the reporting was picked up by journalism blog buzz machine.com

[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.900]
main Ellie then had a brief meeting with the posts

[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:07.420]
Topper call Allen either dump the consultant gigs for radio or say goodbye to your job with the post John said goodbye to the post

[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.580]
Oh, you know what I remember when that happened

[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.780]
I didn't remember his name, but I remember that story now from listening to Howard

[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.940]
I consider myself fired main Ellie tells the read or I can't live on what I earned from the post

[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.660]
I'm very disappointed. I'm really pissed off at Howard's journey says for now on anything

[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.380]
I write about him will have to have it a disclaimer

[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.320]
John main Ellie has an extra grind against this man

[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.440]
Here's a few reasons why John's departure from the post won't result in a lot of best wishes cards

[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.740]
Posted to the ex-post radio poster. It says but also came to let was man Ellie's primary source in the story

[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.300]
Was a common instrument side radio a publication that's about old-fashioned radio

[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:53.260]
And owned by a clear channel who not only owns tons of radio stations, but also an investor in xm

[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:59.000]
So you have a writer who gets paid by traditional radio sourcing another writer gets paid by traditional radio conglomerate

[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.900]
Spreading lies about a phenomenon happening on satellite radio

[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.840]
Don't try posting up the king of all media unless you want to get posterized in public it says

[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.600]
And then the other story the headline is stern gets John main Ellie fired

[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:14.840]
Etc

[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.380]
Well at any rate this is a slimy guy evidently from what the these articles all say

[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.020]
So maybe maybe he just you know is bored maybe he's sitting right up there in New York

[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.900]
I know I'd be bored as hell if I was in New York

[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.300]
820 on a Monday night and decided to write me that long caustic email

[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.400]
He is a consultant after all who knows who he's consulting at this point, you know, right

[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:47.060]
Who knows who inspired that caustic email maybe it was not joebell maybe it was your friends down the street

[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.540]
Well joebell came by the studio and then he said he didn't know anything about that guy

[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.440]
Really mm-hmm take that for what it's worth

[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.900]
Joe Bell is reporting to you is in it yeah, he came by the studio. He's like I don't I don't even know who that guy is

[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.680]
Like okay, tell Joe to go do some managing please go pee on the tower and get that signal boost up a little bit

[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:16.900]
Please he's just I'm just so involved with the show it just kind of scary doesn't it doesn't it scare you a little bit?

[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.500]
a little bit

[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.940]
It's like he's a part of it

[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.400]
Like he's he's in it

[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.380]
Ernie says hello Neil are you there? Hello is anybody there no signal again damn

[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.840]
Well, why would it be all that much better today? Why would it be that much different from Tuesday than it was on Monday

[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:41.160]
Rudy says as you came back from vacation where is George? I was non vacation a month vacation next week

[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.100]
Where is George? George is at home. He's fired. He's gone

[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.200]
Cost-cutting so they say

[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.180]
Everybody's getting fired

[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.060]
everybody's out

[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.280]
Wtq am hello

Good morning, you know yes sir. Good morning. Morning. I don't know what everybody was talking about

[00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:02.620]
You saw it perfectly fine. Uh, compared to yesterday really great. Yeah, it's pretty good

[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:10.220]
Where are you? I mean, uh, I'll watch you on the road in high alia and yesterday. I heard the ocean waves, but today you're

[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:16.480]
Where the best thing that we got out of the ocean okay? I've been doing the backstroke for like 20 hours

[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.840]
And I've almost fell asleep with the wheel yesterday with all that soothing

[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.420]
Waves crashing

[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.320]
Hey, I know the thing I know you guys were talking briefly on the

[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:26.860]

[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.060]
Schedule the closing

[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:37.380]
Can you tell me one yeah, okay, because I got one coming up. They want to schedule one on Monday

[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.120]
Was the hell want to close on the Monday? I

[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.700]
Really doing a Friday move on my crap in but yeah

All right, good luck to pal good luck. Don't believe anything. Please says

[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:54.640]
What are you what are you smirking about? Why are you smircling? I'm sorry. I said it now. You ought to be Q.A.M. Hello

[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.600]
Thank God you finally fired towards Neil and thank God

[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.180]
WQ.A.M. Hello

[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:01.960]
Anything

[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.300]
Hi there. Yes, sir

[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.360]
And I was talking to some of my disciples uh

[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:12.340]
Yeah, some of your disciples yeah Reverend Schmuck back again in force with the boyfriend

[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:18.040]
Some of my disciples now. Let me ask you when are you going to get to the point where you're going to be able to do something with these calls

[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.980]
I'm hoping by maybe next week

[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.020]
Oh

[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:35.500]
Mark Johnson's got some housekeeping things here about radio boy. This is this is not a radio show anymore

[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:41.560]
It's a show about radio like that old guy you say it's a show within a show. It's uh, I don't know what it is

[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.700]
It's yeah, right. That's the idea you're not supposed to know what it is

[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:47.760]
John

[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:53.020]
Maynilly so um, he's not one of our consultants. I guess Walter Sabo is the guy who's going to be foisted on us, right?

[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.580]
Maybe that's supposed to really piss me off. I don't mind

[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.420]
I'm sure Walter can really impart some great suggestions

[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.900]
Don't you think and not as good as Clarence though. Well, I can't wait to hear him

[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:11.940]
Oh, wait a minute. Maybe this is from your buddy Jolly Joe. Yes, it is

[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:13.520]
Uh-oh

[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:19.520]
Oh

[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:24.740]
Here we go. You ready for this. Let me let me do the break. Let me tease it. Oh

[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.080]
My god, you will not believe

[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:29.640]
Wow

[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.780]
Chris Ackerman of Coleman Research. You know who that is. No

[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.340]
Whoa

[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:44.480]
Oh

[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:53.220]
Oh my god, it doesn't matter what you've done the last 30 years and the meter world all that matters is what you've done in the past 60 seconds

[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.840]
We need to be more concise and more compelling

[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.140]
Are we concise and compelling so far? I think we have been although nobody cares about John Maynilly

[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.980]
Although I did get a whole bunch of emails about him right away because he's involved with Stern

[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:13.560]
Or was and Stern got his ass fired and they rated it makes for some interesting their reading

[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.880]
1027 at 560 WQ AM

[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.920]
We'll always

[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.260]
I will always love

[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.960]
I will always love

[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.700]
1031 this is even funnier than the John Maynilly email. Okay

[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.860]
From your close personal buddy Jolly Joe who just came by to say does no John Maynilly

[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.360]
Mm-hmm

[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.040]
He says I didn't see the John Maynilly email you're referring do send me a copy

[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:09.480]
Regarding educating you on what do we call that because we can't say the letters on the newer rating system

[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.100]
Why can't we say the the thing? I don't know we just can't say it

[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:20.160]
Once the summer schedule starts we will have a show meeting every Tuesday and Thursday following the program at 2.15 p.m

[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.640]
That's gonna be about because we have a promotions meeting at 2.30 on Thursdays

[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.980]
Well, it's maybe it'll be a short show meeting. Okay

[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.920]
You're gonna have to re-re-re- listen this I'm sure this supersedes all your other uh

[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.500]
duties

[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.560]
With the big bucks you're getting paid for this show

[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:42.260]
Mm-hmm these meetings will include any info we come across regarding the new rating system as well as a discussion

[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.960]
What appears to be working and what's not working?

[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:49.420]
I'm asking Chris Akram and of Coleman research to conduct a webinar for all Beasley airtell

[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.240]
He did this for Philadelphia was very educational

[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:56.420]
I've given you some ideas which you quickly rejected Neil nobody cares about the weekly arbitrage numbers

[00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.820]
Especially two hours worth of them

[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:05.960]
Everybody is tired of hearing how stupid I am how stupid choices how stupid josh is how stupid the bees these are how stupid the engineers are etc etc etc

[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:11.000]
Everybody is tired of it. Are you tired of it? No, well, you're not everybody

[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.020]
You're out now you're out of the loop

[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.240]
Is I mentioned to you last week a consultant friend of mine said it best

[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:23.220]
It doesn't matter what you've done in the past 30 years in the meter world all that matters is what you've done in the past 60 seconds

[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.660]
I mentioned that all of our hosts need to be more concise and more compelling

[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:32.480]
You can make fun of it all you want but the people who are winning in the new meter game are doing compelling radio

[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.020]
Yeah, like Paul and Ron they're doing compelling radio baby

[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.600]
Which is the first time in history they've been on here for a hundred years and now all of a sudden they're doing compelling radio

[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.580]
That's interesting

[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.140]
As for the technical nightmare the only place we're having problems is on your show

[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.160]
And I'm just guessing that it's because yesterday was their first day in the new studio

[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:55.540]
But I'm just guessing I'll pass this along to George Corso and follow up as always the engineering staff that you ridicule or get the problems fixed quickly

[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.740]
And closing here are a few more constructive points

[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.540]
Own up to the fact that the problems on the show are yours and do something about them

[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.480]
We're getting decent ratings before and after you're sure with the same panel

[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:11.960]
I think it's ironic that after all the years you bash the big O our ratings begin climbing at 2 p.m. When he goes on the air

[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.300]
When it's you do something constructive you could start by being on more this summer

[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:22.120]
If you really care about the show you'll forego your summer schedule and try to address the sagging ratings

[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.000]
My guess is you won't do it because it's easier to sit in Toronto and whine about me

[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.660]
Arbor trying on the fact that we won't let you play heart sounds

[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:35.480]
Speaking of Toronto why don't you come back down here and do the shows this summer get back into the South Florida lifestyle and get in touch with your audience

[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.520]
But we both know that's not going to happen. That's correct

[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.400]
Just like it's not going to happen that I'm going to do more work than my contractor requires

[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.660]
Oh, why it's it if you ever heard of anything so ridiculous? No

[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:53.380]
When you have a that's the only good part of the whole deal he left in there when we wrote this deal is the summer schedule

[00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:01.220]
And if I'm if I'm so bad and so non compelling and so non concise then why do I want me on more during the summer would seem to me

[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.340]
He'd want you on you and courtesan more this summer

[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.500]
Then a real stoch a real shot. I'll send you the wickies when they come out at noon tomorrow

[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.660]
At least then you'll have a day and a half worth of material talk to you soon Joe

[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.000]
At least then you'll have I just just continues with the same hostile tone man

[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.400]
Hostile but very constructive

[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:27.620]
So he'll send me the numbers tomorrow, but we won't talk about him much on the air take maybe two minutes

[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.000]
Here's a email from Kenny grammar and it's a picture of fact Josh Friedman

[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.640]
Kenny says screw them all you're the best even Josh thinks so and it's

[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:44.160]
Josh has got a caption coming out of his mouth. It says I sense hostility between you and flee

[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.260]
But don't worry Neil. I'll put in a good word for you here at seven ninety

[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.420]
Imagine me and you sharing the same seat

[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:55.080]
Screw John Manelli he thinks I stink too even though I do stink. Yeah, you do Josh Josh Friedman

[00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.680]
You know Josh Friedman big gigantic smelly guy. Yeah, I know of him. Oh my god

[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.200]
To know him is to smell him

[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.180]
Know it's the other way around to smell him is to know him

[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:13.840]
See I still would ask the question if our audience isn't part of that panel

[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:19.200]
It's like the with the diaries if you're if you're listeners didn't get a bunch of diaries. How are you gonna do well? Right

[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:24.300]
Right, yeah, does that make sense to you as somebody that's been in the business for more than five minutes? It sure does

[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:29.840]
And like I'd like he and I discussed he agreed with me when we had a conversation about this a couple weeks ago

[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.380]
That the sports nerds did fine because though there were a lot of sports nerd listeners in this panel

[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:42.020]
And at 10 o'clock a lot of them went across the street. They went to some of this the 85 sports stations on

[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:47.300]
So the sports segments did fine. We did not have our audience in the net because I'm not compelling or concise

[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.600]
And don't really have this audience. It's just it's all built on a deck of cards

[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:54.780]
So

[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.600]
Mark says you asked a few questions in recent months. I thought I might answer

[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.840]
There's no such thing as more than one radio station with the same call letters

[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.380]
850 is the only station whose legal call letters at WFTL

[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.180]
640 is WMEN formerly WGNA and 1400 is WFLL

[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:12.120]
Cheap channel has done the same thing for seven years in the Tampa

[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:18.200]
970 AM and 540 AM they call both WFLA but 540 is actually WFLF

[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:23.680]
WFLF has never mentioned on air except for the legal ID WFLF pine hills or land. Oh

[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:30.780]
QAM's rumor of a new stick has long been exactly that a rumor. According to the FCC they never applied for a construction permits his mark

[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.880]
You read a press release on air from George Beasley regarding the Vegas cluster between the lines

[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.340]
There was some solid information that explains much about what's happened and what will happen at WQAM

[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:46.740]
Beasley has a hundred and seventy million dollar loan secured with broadcast licenses that in many cases may not be worth what they paid for them

[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:52.140]
The problem is in Demick in the radio industry Beasley has strict covenants with its lenders to call for cash flows

[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.860]
Goals by 2012 that I don't think they can meet

[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.960]
I think they've cut about all they can and the revenue just isn't there

[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:03.500]
BBGI's competitors often desperate to raise cash have turned to selling some stations often at fire sale prices

[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.240]
Lastly and then he tells me about the maybe I can

[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.160]
Fix my perennial shopped off printouts issued by printing to Adobe PDF

[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.980]
It says if the PDF print is good you need a new printer. Oh, I don't want to do that

[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.560]
Do I want to buy a new printer? No

[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:24.700]
Okay, let's take a look at the poll, which is not all that compelling I guess you think the poll is compelling

[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.300]
It's okay some of the some of them are and some of them are not I guess

[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:36.460]
The people who are doing well are doing compelling radio that that has to be one of the greatest lines in the history of the business

[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.460]
Paul and Ron anybody believe they're doing a 10 or 12 share

[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.760]
No, did they believe they're doing a 10 well who knows

[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.080]
367 votes on this pool. I don't go to spectator sports often because blank

[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.300]
It's easier to stay home and watch them on TV of course 172

[00:30:54.080 --> 00:31:00.260]
The ticket prices are too high 95 the athletes are spoiling overpaid 42. They're usually boring 24

[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:06.860]
Food and drinks are too expensive 15. I do go off from 15 too many drunk fans for and the weather none

[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:12.220]
You put the weather on there. Well, I know a lot of people don't go to the market. I'm telling man

[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.220]
Oh, sorry, a lot of people won't go because it rains yeah

[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:26.200]
Kenny Gramer has got a thing here about this Coleman consultant guy

[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:27.620]
Okay

[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.760]
Oh, no, we're not Coleman Chris Akram. Excuse me

[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.560]
Coleman insights. That's an inverse company

[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:44.140]
Mm-hmm. Well, that's good. Hey listen. We'll take all the help we can get we need to figure out how to play this new game, you know

[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:50.040]
And nobody wants to hear about Joe and Joyce and this and that well, maybe if they'd let me do the show

[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.240]
Maybe then we'd stop talking about those things

[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.520]
Oh, it's just a few fart sounds

[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.660]
Yeah, that's right just a few fart sounds

[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:05.420]
Here's one that says Uncle Neil since you're rating suddenly went to the toilet with this obviously flawed new system

[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.800]
Jolly Joe's been ordering you to be more compelling. What does that even mean?

[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.000]
Now you're talking about having consultant foisted on you

[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.500]
What's he gonna tell you a radio legend of 30 years until recently stellar ratings

[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:21.040]
Do a pukey morning zoo type show have crappy guests on what a joke. I don't know. We do uh

[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.900]
We do stream of consciousness on this show

[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.940]
Always have and always will we don't do guests. We don't do topics

[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.200]
Jay and Paul to Moritz says is one of Georgia's biggest fans

[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.020]
Are we didn't appreciate to be able to sit through flee doing the show on Friday?

[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.220]
I gave it a chance. I must say flee was good

[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:42.060]
He has very good chemistry with Josh. They'll do a good job this summer screw Joe Bell says Jay and Baltimore

[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.380]
All right, he just says screw. He didn't say you know

[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.360]
The other thing. Yeah. Thank God

[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.540]
I did think that turned out to be pretty compelling

[00:32:54.220 --> 00:33:01.840]
Do you know anything about chocolate from the controversy? Oh mayor of New Orleans comes a brand new chocolate treat

[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:09.880]
Will be chocolate racist peanut butter cops. How do you make chocolate? It's a delicious brand of dark chocolate

[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:17.640]
Surrounding a super normal peanut butter and because it's Ray Nagan's racist peanut butter cops

[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.900]
All the peanut butter has been moved out and replaced with chocolate

[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:28.960]
I'm talking about just the way God intended is the way God wants it to be

[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.940]
I'm sure to try the delicious new chocolate drink

[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:39.680]
Nagan's quick you mix it with light milk and it becomes a delicious drink and for chocolates and nothing much chocolate

[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.600]
Races pieces

[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.820]
No other way fort boys he and noggin head or what he's an idiot

[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.720]
He and his wife are still in quarantine. I believe over in China or somewhere with the um

[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:57.640]
Flying flu wow they don't have it, but I mean they were sitting next to somebody on the plane or whatever it was

[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.040]
If they're smart they'll keep them there

[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:05.880]
Vos wants to know will QN be covering the baseball draft today if someone can I tune in for the compelling talk

[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.920]
Don't make make fun of it now, Vos

[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:14.780]
What does that mean compelling talk and can somebody explain that to me? What does that mean? I don't know talking about

[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.040]
Ball games talking about the jox draft talking about

[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:26.080]
What's his name Lebron and Lebron and Lebron and Kobe and Lebron and Lebron and Kobe and Kobe and Lebron and on and on and on and Jimmy and Danny

[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.320]
Wouldn't compelling be different for every person

[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:34.940]
I don't know what I have no idea what that means what I find compelling you might not find compelling. Yeah, that's correct

[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:43.260]
Terri says I'm a 40-year-old male has been listening to you since my father gave me my first transistor radio within the year piece

[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:49.480]
So when we said it marked light I could listen you to call the canes baseball games Frank Castro God it says oh Dennis

[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:59.980]
Yeah, are we the name on the address at the top here and that's Dennis first time long time thanks Dennis Frank Castro God is right love your Frank. I wonder how Frank Castro is doing

[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:06.300]
And speaking of that talk about compelling when we have those you and basketball games on like in the middle of the show

[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:12.140]
That's pretty compelling here. Are you compelled to like turn it off? I mean I'm compelled to maybe

[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.400]
So so what did you what was your take on that last email?

[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.120]
I mean you had you know take on John Manelley's email. What's your take on the jolly joe belly male? I just read you

[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:27.060]
Did you detect a certain degree of hostility in there a little bit. Yeah hate

[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:34.620]
Yeah, come on now don't don't let let one or two seconds drag there

[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.200]
Well, I think he definitely poked you with a stick every once in a while

[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:44.340]
You know, I think he says stuff just to get a rise out of you. Yeah, I can't believe that he means some of the stuff that he says because some of it just doesn't make sense

[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.540]
Like what like meeting with clearance every day or twice a week?

[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:52.560]
No, no, no, no, see and and he just he just had a self-defeating argument there because if I were to work more days

[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:57.220]
During the summertime then there be more ding dong school meetings after the show with clearance every day

[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.440]
Sure, so I'm not gonna set myself up for that

[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.260]
Can you imagine

[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:03.180]
No

[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.140]
Three four or five days a week ding dong school after the show every day with clearance

[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:13.800]
Why are you trolling because it's just so idiotic. Yeah

[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:15.520]
Insane

[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.760]
Inane for clearance is gonna teach us how to do a compelling concise radio show. I can't see

[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.120]
Clarence knows his crap man. Yeah

[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:35.660]
Okay, now let me see if we can get this phone thing going because unfortunately when they design the I don't understand why it lines one through six or all the toll free number

[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:44.320]
Is that a cost-cutting measure is that well, what's the deal with that? I don't know

[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:50.260]
560 and pound five 60 on the Verizon and AT&T wireless line, but we don't because the first six lines are the toll free lines

[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:51.580]
1 877

[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.380]
785 6345

[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.180]
And it's right there at the top of our pool on the website if you can't keep that and it's hard to memorize that

[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:02.560]
You know, yeah, even I can't do it. I'm reading it off a thing on here

[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:07.440]
Can you memorize it? You know what we'll fast without looking? No, I don't either

[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.300]
1 877

[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.720]
785 6345 and that's the majority of our phone lines or at least more than half of them

[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.600]
WQ a.m. Hello

[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:22.020]
Hello, yes sir. Hi, Neil. Yes, I am. Hi

[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.560]
Just you know, I've been out of town. I haven't been I'm not up on the latest

[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:34.180]
I just heard you tell another listener that George is out. Yes, and the last the last I heard when when I was listening before I had to leave town

[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:39.020]
Was that you know being debated but I never imagined that it would actually come to pass

[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:47.300]
It did it's a matter of fact. I was even thinking of an ex logical step for George was to get his own show like you did before after you or something

[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:55.480]
So I just I hope George is listening. I just want to shout out and say do I can't believe it

[00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:00.420]
Shocking how long has it been 19 year or how long has it been since you got can yeah

[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.640]
Um, what about three weeks? Yeah, it sounds about right?

[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:09.740]
That's how long and I've been visiting your website when I can and I see is you know his email link is still there and I thought okay

[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:14.800]
He's still there it's cool. No, he's not here unbelievable those people in management in your place

[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:21.120]
I just have their heads right up their butt. Okay, they don't see it all right. Sorry and I'll still listen

[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:27.640]
But it just won't be the same. Okay pal have a great day. Have a good one

[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:32.960]
See those lines one through six is it's gonna be a grim and slim on air

[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:38.320]
Until they learn that new number. Mm-hmm, but I don't want to complain now

[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.900]
I don't want to wine and complain sit here in Toronto and wine and wine. Oh, yeah, like that

[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:51.720]
I mean sure I'd like to have the show back the way that I did it for years and years and of course that that has nothing to do with the fact that those numbers are invisible now

[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.340]
That has nothing to do with it. No

[00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:00.960]
What no? Of course not all I got to do is start playing stuff that joy is gonna have a nervous breakdown about and then oh

[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:07.120]
You know you're fired you're out and you're violating our deal and okay and so I don't

[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:09.620]

[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.100]
WQ a.m. Hello

[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.740]
That's the tool free line

[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.080]
one eight seven seven

[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:28.200]
Seven eight five sixty three forty five. That's the toll free number

[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.160]
Most of our lines are that number so if you're trying to call

[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:35.320]
And what was the deal yesterday? They were trying to call and getting a busy. I don't know

[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:40.260]
What what did that mean because we never had more than I don't know two three lines lit at the time like we do now

[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.920]
Right, I'm guessing maybe some of these lines aren't active

[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.860]
They're what I'm guessing that some of these lines aren't working right?

[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:48.880]
Well, let me try

[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.700]
That one's working

[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:52.580]
That one's working

[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.520]
Hey, that one's working. There you go

[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.220]
And that one's working. They're all working. Yeah, nobody should get dizzy then

[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:04.280]
But when I get we're trying to get rid of them. They don't go away

[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.060]
Oh boy

[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:11.340]
Yeah, we have some technical problems, but I'm sure that they'll fix it immediately if not sooner

[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.440]
They're right on top of it just like a civil situation

[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.560]
Well, what do you what do you plan that for what

[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.880]
WQ a.m. Hello

[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:46.740]
bad

[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.080]

[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.480]
WQ a.m. Hello

[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:18.740]
Hello

[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:18.980]
Hola

[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:21.660]
Yes

[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.560]
WQ a.m. Hello

[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:27.520]
Corso

[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.300]
WQ a.m. Hello

[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:40.200]
Yes, sir what a pleasure. Thank you for taking my call. Well, thank you for making your call. I go no

[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:46.260]
Please don't hang up I go back a long long while with a you first came to Florida. Why do you say please don't hang up?

[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.320]
I don't know I haven't called you in years and years and years

[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:56.740]
But I go back as I said a long time and your boss is just don't get it a lot of us are interested in the ratings a lot of us are

[00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:00.560]
interested in this stick and they're out of it and what they don't understand it

[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.880]
I'm gonna leave you with this what they don't understand is in an emergency you remember Andrew

[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:09.780]
You can take over and deal with radio like no body else can

[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:17.080]
That's not sucking out my friend that is just a fact. I'm gonna listen off the I'm gonna get off the phone you my friend stay well bye-bye

[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:25.040]
Yeah, let's have another hurricane come on real good on that stuff

[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:30.300]
In fact, it was it was very fortuitous that I was here

[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:35.540]
When we had Katrina and that spade of hurricanes going on yeah because

[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:39.680]
There was no hurricane here. So we're you know, I never lost power

[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.220]
I could follow it all on the internet non TV and we did pretty damn good coverage if you ask me myself

[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.420]
I'll tell you I think we did it was compelling

[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:51.740]
It was compelling and it was constructive and as far as my being down in South Florida and getting the flavor

[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.460]
I already got the flavor. Okay. I don't I don't like that flavor

[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:02.580]
I mean two of the benefits that I have in my deal is one being able to be here and do the show

[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.140]
Which I enjoy very very much and number two the summer schedule

[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:11.100]
That's it and he wants me to the give them both up if you cared about the show

[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:16.120]
No, I don't care. That's why I show up here every morning at 8 30 in the morning because I don't care about it

[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:22.860]
And how is it all of a sudden star? It's like a bad April fools joke April first

[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:27.660]
That's when when when the new rating system came in that's when the show ceased to have any relevance

[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:33.200]
That's when it ceased being compelling it ceased being concise. It ceased being anything worthwhile

[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:37.760]
Everybody's tired to hear you all about my everybody's turn

[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:44.520]
So what we're gonna get now is a hell of a lot more interference than we had before

[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:49.080]
I'm not talking about interference with a signal. That's bad enough. We're gonna get more interference in the show fine. Go ahead

[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.920]
Go right ahead. No actually what I mean is yeah, yeah

[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.540]
Let's have the consultant of the day

[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:00.180]
Every day we can have a different consultant doing a a web stream

[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:07.160]
Giving us song at a dance and then you know, then we have those meetings with Clarence. Don't you look forward to those? Oh, yeah, I certainly do

[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:16.440]
I can't wait till he imparts his uh, but there you go again. There you go. Knock in Clarence. I mean he's on his honeymoon. Oh, geez poor Clarence

[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.800]
1056 at 560 wq way. I'm let me

[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.480]
inations

[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:27.440]

[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.420]
I

[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.440]
of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you.

[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.900]
Oh, the power of Christ compels you.

[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.880]
Oh, the power of Christ compels you.

[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:10.720]
Oh, I feel compelled to spirit a Christ compel me to continue the 11 o'clock hour.

[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:15.580]
And ex-con is suing an upstate New York prison nurse who allegedly sent it back

[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:20.740]
to his cell after medication side effects gave him a painful erection that wouldn't go away.

[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:29.380]
Dao Wood Yada Yada Ula says he suffered for 55 hours before finally getting hospital treatment

[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:33.440]
to relieve the problem in his pants. He had a problem in his pants.

[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:41.020]
Oh, yeah, I did hear on Friday. I heard like 10 seconds after I came back from my closing,

[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.620]
which I could have actually done probably at 4 in the afternoon, according to you.

[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.600]
But in any way, I heard about 10 seconds and you were talking about, oh, I like drugs.

[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.580]
Yeah. Well, what does that mean? You like drugs?

[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.940]
I think it's pretty self-explanatory.

[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:06.440]
Yada Ula 43 claims nurse Judith Lovelase's diagnostic follow-up. Isn't that interesting that her name was Lovelase?

[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.400]
I wonder if she's kind of Linda, you think? Could be.

[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:14.140]
Her follow-up left him irreparably injured with severe damage to his penis, including erectile dysfunction,

[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:17.300]
inability to ejaculate and pain during sexual intercourse.

[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:25.600]
He now needs a prosthesis to possibly restore some sexual function and says his medical problems have caused difficulty in his marriage.

[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.260]
55-hour erection. He was doing hard time.

[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.880]
Jim says, hey, Uncle Neil, the phone calls our dull, boring coma inducing and they blow.

[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:41.320]
Jim in treasure-cage grade abacobahamas. He says the calls blow.

[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:43.480]
WQYM, hello.

[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:44.840]
Hello, good morning, Fuy.

[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.240]
Hello, Uncle Fuy.

[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.040]
Hello, Neil.

[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:47.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.700]
Oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry.

[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:51.460]
Don't be sorry.

[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:59.220]
Hey, that's what I tell you. Yeah, I'm in Miami Springs and since yesterday morning, I mean, this has been since you started yesterday morning.

[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:05.100]
There have been waves all, I mean, the waves have come through all morning.

[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.820]
I mean, the last couple of days.

[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.360]
So the guy called him highly. I don't know what the heck he was talking about.

[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:16.740]
But you still got the waves on the radio signal there. I mean, it sounds terrible.

[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.260]
I mean, okay, thanks for the bad news. Thanks.

[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.480]
Oh, and as a matter of fact, guess I'll give you 85 guesses and the first 84 don't count.

[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:28.820]
Guess what famous radio broadcaster emailed me again to tell me the same thing that this guy just told me.

[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:33.560]
I'll give you a little clue and audio clue in a second if I can ever get around to it.

[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:35.660]
One moment, please. I'm a little slow. I'm old enough.

[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:36.280]
The last minute.

[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.880]
There you go. That's a pretty good clue.

[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:43.600]
Yeah, he says the signal still sucks in downtown Miami at least maybe because I work right under the stick at the

[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.660]
Harold, but why would that be? I can't ething believe it still isn't fixed.

[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.320]
It still isn't fixed says.

[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.700]
Wow. What does that mean? He can't believe it still isn't fixed.

[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.320]
Like they're going to wave a magic wind out there at the tower or something.

[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.660]
They've got some serious signal problems and believe you me. I could be wrong.

[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:04.940]
Correct me if I'm wrongfully. I could be wrong, but it would seem to me that part of succeeding with the new system

[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:08.160]
is that your signal can be heard everywhere well, right?

[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.700]
to keep people glued inside. Let's see if this works.

[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:12.640]
I don't think so.

[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:16.360]
I've had some other sounds that might do it. Here's one that always works.

[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:17.440]
That does it.

[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.180]
In fact, you know something? I think I just came up with a new format thanks to that great email that constructive

[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.100]
informative email from Jolli Joe.

[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.220]
four-hour format.

[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:32.280]
Sure.

[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:37.340]
here. You don't think I think so? Be the talk of the town. The new

[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:44.740]
neorogist format four hours of we miss you Mo. Badly. The

[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:48.920]
fake Tom jikus is John Manele was PD at 77 W ABC after they

[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:53.480]
moved from music to right wing talk. Boy, he's a real I don't

[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.280]
know a real deep bag. It sounds like to me I could be wrong

[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.880]
but reading that thing about Howard and all that other and

[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.560]
of course he was at the New York Post. What does that say? And

[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:10.660]
then all of a sudden right wing talk at W ABC 77. Terry says just

[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.320]
tune in online was going to vote on your poll could you add I don't

[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.740]
give a crap about professional sports which I think is different

[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:20.000]
from they're usually boring. Now wait a minute what is the

[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.100]
question say again? I don't go to spectator sports often it

[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.560]
doesn't say professional sports could be college sports high

[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.800]
school sports right college in pro I'm sure is what we're

[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:36.240]
talking about the pool myster. Do you want to add that? I

[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.140]
don't I don't care about sports. I mean I think it's the same

[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:41.800]
as they're usually boring but I can if you want. No it's not

[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.980]
the same as they're usually boring. I mean there's some some

[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.920]
people that care about sports but they're not going to go

[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.640]
paid to see the game because they don't want to like sit there

[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.640]
in a coma for three hours. It's not compelling to them. Okay.

[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:54.180]
Like you said before some things are compelling to some

[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:56.900]
people and other things are compelling to other people. I

[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:59.560]
personally don't find Drew Rosenhaus very compelling I could be

[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:02.840]
wrong. No. I don't give a flying crap about how Drew was

[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.820]
doing with the ladies you know I mean I could be wrong about

[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:07.760]
that. That to me is not compelling and I don't think that's

[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.380]
why people listen to the Joe Rochow is because it's compelling

[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:13.940]
to find out why how Drew was doing with the ladies. I could be

[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:17.160]
wrong. I mean what do I know? What do I know about anything?

[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:18.760]
Obviously nothing.

[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.760]
And the threat continues the threat goes on. Oh I'm going to

[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.260]
tell you this we're going to give you a okay well where is

[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.640]
some meat okay where is something specific? Now don't talk

[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.780]
about this don't talk about that don't bitch about this give

[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:38.920]
us something positive something specific. Let's get some of

[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.340]
them nifty guess on maybe I will win bag will grace us with

[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.580]
this presence but we can only hope not. What do you think?

[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:49.820]
I'll keep my fingers crossed. Ricks is I cannot believe the

[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.480]
depth WQM management is going to get you out and go to

[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.700]
total sports talk all day.

[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.880]
Doesn't Joe Bell know what your show was like prior to the

[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.800]
censorship imposed by the lame brains who controlled

[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.800]
Beasley. See there you go again Richard bitching about this

[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:05.860]
stuff that Joe Bell is one here about. Compiling radio is

[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:08.280]
something neither Joe Bell or Joyce understands your show

[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.960]
prior to the recent restrictions was a very compelling show. I

[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.100]
can't believe that the bigos ratings can be better than

[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:15.780]
yours. He is so one dimensional and boring sort of like Joe

[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:19.400]
B. When I'm in South Florida which is about twice a year I put up

[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.080]
with a crummy signal just to listen to you. I really find it

[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:26.060]
galling that somehow Joe JB finds ways to blame your show for

[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.320]
the bad signal I hear all the time down there. You haven't

[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:31.340]
heard anything like what it is yesterday today from what I'm

[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.920]
told and then the guy that put the phone up to the radio

[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:37.620]
yesterday that was that was scary. That was downright scary.

[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.740]
PSI like your show better without the insipid telephone

[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:44.180]
calls from those South Florida nut cases. Now what's your

[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:47.720]
take you like the calls are not. I like some of them.

[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.340]
Yeah some are compelling and some are not. Right. Most of them

[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:55.660]
are crap but nevertheless why would they change now?

[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:01.120]
Paul says how dare Joe Bell insult you in your 30 years of

[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.640]
consistently compelling and entertaining radio. Yeah Joe how dare you.

[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:07.840]
It is painfully obvious here they are trying to force you out

[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:11.560]
which you say will not happen that's right. That gutless Joe Bell if he

[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.940]
had the balls he would pay you off and say you're free to go to

[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:16.720]
another station. Why not if he's telling you you suck.

[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.120]
And his final stoch will be insisting you can't be on the

[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.360]
air for the balance of your contract over four years remaining

[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:26.080]
of compelling radio. I hope somebody waterboards Joe says Paul

[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:31.720]
getting a little carried away. Well the hostile a lot of hostility

[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:37.500]
in the year you know Seth these emails back and forth. Yeah everybody is

[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:39.940]
tired of this and everybody says oh Tom jikka John

[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:42.480]
main Ellie wrote the local limbaugh's article in newsmax.

[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.740]
Here's what he wrote on you oh my god he wrote this.

[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:50.540]
Neil Rogers here's another talk to your host who's openly gay except that

[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.160]
unlike L.A.'s conservative Rale Alice Rantele

[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:58.460]
Rogers is right proud and proud and loud liberal with serious anti-social

[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:02.840]
tendencies. Most of the time he doesn't even come to the radio station

[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.900]
preferring instead to broadcast from Canada and work short weeks and take

[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.640]
long vacations. A Jew who's tough on his really

[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:12.180]
right wingers. The often cranky Rogers keeps away from hard news most of

[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:15.700]
the time and focuses on stories events and phenomena that interest his

[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:21.140]
large young male audience. Wow his levels in and he rebels in not

[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:24.120]
going national has even been owned with nor calls from interest in networks.

[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.600]
Oh yeah like those fake calls from Greg Budell.

[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:33.800]
Typical comment gay is who I am that's how I see things on the air.

[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:37.260]
There are a few queens on the air like Alice Rantele who is dragged out of the

[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:40.400]
closet kicking and screaming. That's it.

[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.280]
That's on Newsmax what John Manelli wrote about me.

[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.860]
I have a large young male audience he says.

[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:49.740]
Wow.

[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:57.240]
John Manelli also wrote a Newsmax see Newsmax this is a right

[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.160]
winger okay does that start to explain why he wrote all this crap?

[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:05.020]
Yeah a right wing fanatic. Local talkers I'll talk where you made a name for

[00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:08.440]
itself he wrote being the only outlet for scrappy opinions in the pre-internet

[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:12.020]
days John Manelli from a program director from Powerhouse WABC Radio in

[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:15.500]
New York one of the top guns in the industry top gurus tells Newsmax.

[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:19.020]
Personally I prefer listening to local talk shows over via the internet

[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:22.180]
because the national hosts tend to flagulate the same two or three topics.

[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:26.440]
That's right every day communist to communist to the same old crap.

[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:31.820]
Mike says thanks for playing everyone's favorite sound bite the power of

[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.560]
communist compels you now that's compelling radio says Mike we

[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:37.760]
compelled Mike to send the email all right.

[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:42.780]
I don't know what I'm going to do about this uh this toll free number

[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:46.080]
because lines two three four and five yesterday and today I don't think ever

[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:50.040]
rang at any point. Not that it's a big deal I mean you know you can only take

[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.820]
one call at a time but nevertheless

[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:58.380]
Michael says could you please ask flee to take the joke spots off the stream

[00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.900]
okay they play it constantly and are really annoying they lose their

[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:05.900]
compelitive compelling those I have not the word is

[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.000]
compelling this after three or four times

[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:17.640]
Gary says dear Neil Joe Bell you just don't get it please visit China

[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.700]
and get your stupid self quarantine for 50 years and take that simple

[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:24.040]
mighted Joyce with you I have to get that formula you have for turning gold

[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.280]
into lead I'm compelled to listen to your compelling

[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:29.640]
radio show Neil I'll turn into George and his compelling show wherever he shows

[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.620]
enjoy your wonderful summer schedule says Gary at home said

[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:37.480]
thanks Gary I will okay I just did an experiment yes I called the 877 line

[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:40.280]
while that one was ringing in uh-huh and guess what I got

[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.300]
busy signal absolutely correct

[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:51.620]
so I guess it's not rolling over I am I'm going to lay down on the floor during

[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:56.180]
the break and I'm going to roll over but I'm sure that just like Joe says you

[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:58.600]
tell course about it they'll have it fixed pronto Tonto

[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.560]
it'll be fixed before you can say boy this is a technical disaster

[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.860]
Neil Rogers God

[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:08.840]
absolutely

[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:12.260]
the public hands got their leaders

[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.620]
serving in Washington

[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:20.360]
what the guy in charge is a radio talker he's a piled up and son of a dumb

[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:25.700]
well he beg and bald as a man can come and he screams into the microphone

[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:31.280]
and if he says something like the GOP don't like it just leave it alone

[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.740]
that's because I gotta say you don't curse

[00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:40.160]
I'm a vacant name you don't criticize George Bullish

[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:45.020]
you don't quest where the we should be taxed good and you don't mess around with

[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:45.300]
brush

[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:53.200]
you don't get married if you get you park your hair on the side with a brush

[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:58.780]
you don't get any credit to a photo of all my antigo mess around with brush

[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:07.200]
1118 at 560 WDQM so that means it's lying two lying three lying four lying five

[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.980]
they don't work no more right or at least they never did

[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:13.420]
well maybe you want to bring that to the attention of some of our crack

[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:14.820]
engineering staff will do

[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:19.380]
Steve says and of course this is ridiculous why not play the fat man in his own

[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:21.360]
game and do a sports show and your inimitable style

[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:24.760]
it will be somewhat compelling to hear someone give an honest humorous opinion

[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:29.220]
um about sports rather than another member of the jocque accuracy yucking it up

[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:32.240]
no thanks we got 20 hours of that crap already on his station

[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:37.280]
and they've got a whole bunch of people on that panel who are sports nuts baby

[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:48.260]
right yes and I and I'm not interested how can I be compelling about something

[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:51.920]
I mean I you know I watch the hockey I don't care anymore because obviously

[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:56.220]
Detroit's going to win the Stanley Cup is that game tonight I think game six

[00:57:56.220 --> 00:58:01.280]
game six yet yeah in Pittsburgh oh boy I'm so tired of the red wings I don't

[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.720]
know about you but I'm really sick and tired of the red wings

[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.780]
not very compelling in a market that doesn't care about hockey

[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:11.900]
yeah really what he has is that x-ray it was the next

[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:14.560]
ray that had to go deep into the spine heavy heavy radiance

had a gigantic exclusive cum people who listen to this show who don't listen

[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:43.400]
to the sports shows right always for sure and those people just on the first

[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.280]
of April on April Fool's Day they just all say oh we don't want to hear him

[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:51.980]
anymore bye bye is there anybody in their right mind who believes that no no

[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.660]
458 votes I don't quote a spectator sports often because it's easier to stay

[00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:03.140]
home and watch them on TV 216 the ticket prices are too high 121 the athletes

[00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:10.160]
are spoiled and overpaid 46 they're usually boring not compelling boring 27 I do

[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:15.600]
go off in 21 food and drinks are too expensive 17 too many drunken fans

[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:18.740]

[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:05.800]
the people who run your show are aware of this kind of stuff they don't care about that I mean

[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:09.220]
you know you're you're like you're part of the expression farting into a wind storm it's just

[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:14.060]
it makes no difference what other people are doing I mean it's on from 630 locally TBS has

[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.680]
an awesome 8 to 10 flea knows about this show well yeah let me tell you something I actually

got suspended for like five weeks because I played a family guy bid on the air and and Clarence

[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.160]
suspended me from being on air for like five weeks where wait a minute one was this this is when I

[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.780]
was doing weekend shifts I didn't know about this oh yeah I played this whole bit about they have

[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:35.180]
this like song the family guy does about the FCC I played it on the air and I got suspended for like

[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:40.180]
five weeks well what what's in it I mean obviously you can't say it but I mean give me some hints he

[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:45.260]
says you have to you have to say take a tinkle because you can't say the P word then that's right yeah

[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:53.280]
and you played that I did oh boy and you're going to be on this summer I can see oh no I've

[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:57.940]
learned my lesson I got to be ultra ultra conservative I understand right be be on your best

[01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:02.520]
behavior at all time it took me a little while to realize that we're going by easily rules and not

[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:07.380]
FCC rules well don't you remember the meeting we had see either this is the boy at FCC regulations

[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:12.780]
and then each broadcaster has got the right and I understand this they've got the right to set

[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:17.580]
their own over and above the FCC their own rules I won't say this word don't do that but but only

[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:22.000]
if they have like a death wish only if they want you to fail do they go to such extremes as

[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.820]
Joyce right and this played a lot of bitch about that because everybody is really tired of hearing

[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:30.640]
about that corner Joe everybody's tired of it and like he said this was family guys so this is

[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:37.260]
planned at prime time on a national network right on over the year TV not cable right on network

[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:49.500]
over the earth TV on Fox on Fox well mm-hmm 5670560 pound 560 in the Verizon and AT&T wireless line

[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:55.380]
on that toll free number I guess they know it it's only line one anyway right yeah what about lines 7

[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:05.320]
oh it doesn't even ring unlucky seven unlucky seven is right that was bad QAM hello I like the

sighting over here on Sheridan street come here George bring your cup with you QAM hello

[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:31.200]
Hill yes sir I have some very news for you speaking of Joe Bell always trying to make believe like

[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.820]
telling technical problems on your show I can't hear these because this call is so low it sounds

[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:43.220]
like it sounds like you're on Uranus really yeah you're talking about Joe Bell he can say about

[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:48.420]
saying your show is going on technical good Colby's we yesterday doing a big show he had to keep

[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:52.640]
coming out of apologize and do his audience by five or six different times two three minutes at

[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:59.660]
a time he was going to get air on on the big old show yeah I was very leading that's true okay

[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:06.920]
second thing I got I got a composition for you I've got a companion ticket would you like to

[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:16.500]
do you have Vegas on me no I would know no thanks bye bye quarter slot Gai idiot Jesus but I like

[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:21.080]
to go to Las Vegas on you not in you not next to you not around you not near you I don't even

[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.840]
spend time he's in Vegas what I don't even want to be the same days he's in Vegas

[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:30.020]
eight and four Lauderdale says how are the ratings on the Joe Bell show maybe he wants your

[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:35.560]
time slot he puts the A and ask clown he does not get it no he's never going to get it he just

[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:42.320]
makes it up as it goes along all Greg butyl says did you catch your buddy how we on Letterman yesterday

[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:50.600]
he still wants you for his 101 channel yeah sure he does my mark Johnson says I tried calling

[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.840]
the tool free line once from Kissimmee Florida about six months ago it didn't work then either I

[01:03:54.840 --> 01:04:05.540]
don't think it's worked at a long time remainder not for air in other words don't read it cold oh boy

[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.900]
my interest in training and radio is on the tech side I'm not a fan of sending more than one

[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:19.220]
email a week but your comments really got me thinking keep this in your pile and maybe read it

[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:23.080]
some other time this will be my last for now I'll tricking again some other time in the futures

[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:28.800]
his mark this is the guy who told us all about the the signal and the tower and the this and the

[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:38.860]
that all is at the crap right and the callators the unmanshedable new oh no this this is worth reading

[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:45.760]
right now it says one of the things I read is that radio podcast live streaming on air broadcast

[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:50.760]
all have to be encoded separately this is about the new rating system correct likewise the unmanshedable

[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:56.120]
new arbitrarily on device cannot pick up listing in any form via headphones radio broadcasting will

[01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:00.420]
probably always be around but the way people listen has changed radically I listen to plenty of radio

[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:06.600]
almost all via earphones around line if I understand this walk man podcast iPhone live stream many other

[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:11.820]
types of listeners are under reported there is an adapter that you can use you can actually plug it

[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:17.760]
into the the device and then plug your headphones into that on a different notice is I don't think

[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:22.020]
QAM signal problems will ever get markedly better 540 AM in central Florida has a flame thrower

[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:27.180]
signal that has to be directional to protect or not step on QAMs at 560 and that of another station

[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:32.860]
in Florida in 550 540 can't power down in part because it's the only primary entry point emergency

[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:38.480]
station in the state as a result I don't think QAM will be able to up its power so of course the

[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.360]
signal and encoding go hand in hand hard to be compelling if people can't hear you I think we

[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:51.720]
need to talk I have a lot louder house I'm going to get that bacon cheeseburger oh no you're not

[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:58.200]
going to eat it that is again yeah I liked it was the best hamburger I've had in years and years

[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:07.700]
years you like it I love it I loved it I didn't like it I loved it WQAM hello hello yes sir oh my

[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:13.160]
goodness Neil Rogers I actually got through yeah oh yeah no problem well the phones are all screwed

[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:18.460]
up so no problem this is I can't play George's gone I just can't play I just call all the time

[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:24.560]
get around with him on the phone I can't especially line just for me but I can't tell you what it

[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:32.860]
is because I don't want to stick compelling yeah but oh my gosh remember me from

[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:41.640]
cam bleep snow beskosure no okay just keep going just glad to hear you yeah and I'll keep listening

[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:50.080]
okay great see you see a medicine had a yeah okay see in PEI a lot of them we see that PEI

[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:55.260]
not sure I don't want to do five days like you did I never knew that before you never told me that

[01:06:55.260 --> 01:07:00.640]
about getting oh yeah put on the bench for five days because you played a family guy bet yeah five

[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:10.880]
weeks five oh five weeks yeah wow that is a shocker five weeks that must have been really heavy

[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.360]
duty whatever you put on there it really wasn't just clearance doesn't like me on the air that's all

[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:19.400]
well that sounds real promising maybe that's why they want me to work more this summer

[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:24.860]
could be Charles and Pine Chris as I listen to Joe but this morning the signal was fine you come on

[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:29.060]
on all of a sudden it blows to me it seems like the signal issues are part of Joe Bell's master

[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:34.060]
plan to get you off would it really surprise you nothing would surprise me Charles nothing would

[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:43.720]
surprise me doctor Alan Berkman passed away says Jennifer why what I would know I know him do you

[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:51.800]
know who that is no I don't either we don't do obituaries anymore sorry sorry Jennifer whoever you

[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:57.460]
are Scott and Pinellas Park says the stream is out it keeps buffering then saying it'll reconnect

[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:02.720]
in 64 seconds then nothing so the stream is out too says the Scott I don't believe that do you

[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:08.980]
oh wait a minute here's another one that says the streaming online is out tell Joe Bell it's not

[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:16.440]
very compelling so they can't hear the signal on the air the streaming is out and we need to be

[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:22.060]
compelling enough to get through to those people with a new rating thing Neil God

[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:25.400]
yeah

[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:03.140]
check this out

[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:40.980]
yeah

[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:13.580]
yeah

[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:37.480]
748 12 minutes until noon at 560 W here we got the big oh coming up at two o'clock that's

[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:42.600]
the number start going up Mike Johnson says not sure what happened but we missed your entire last

[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:47.200]
segment from 11 30 to 11 40 this is the QM School of Engineering for you the streaming is back up

[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:55.100]
though now says Mike it's back up Leo says this came in before mics for your information the

[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:59.940]
streamer feed from W oh look at that W I O D is barely working right now we're not on W I O D

[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:05.100]
we're on W QA and Leo get the station right Leo for some reason I keep getting disconnected

[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:08.840]
can't listen to your show online maybe this issue has something to do with working the bugs out

[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:16.720]
there in your studio yeah that must be it huh when you think could be no yeah good pull today but I

[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:20.620]
think you should add the option of voting for all of the above now the truth is I really enjoy going

[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:26.900]
to sporting events but I avoid them like to play for all of the reasons on the poll Oliver norlando

[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:31.480]
says the newer version of the QM streamer sucks it has to buffer itself numerous times during the

[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:36.880]
show which is the equivalent of dead air another cheap ass jolly Joe solution I live in Orlando I

[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:41.760]
can pick you up over the air but everything has to be perfect in other words no storms no washing

[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:47.900]
machine running etc right now 11 35 a.m. and the streamer is down I will still listen even with all

[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:56.140]
the promises Oliver and Orlando thanks Oliver he's a real trooper W QA M hello Neil good afternoon sir

[01:12:56.140 --> 01:13:02.720]
yes sir good good evening I'm just I'm calling from Pompano a little west 95 just want to let you know

[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:07.600]
the signal is crystal clear up here and I'm actually parked under a tree so I think these I think

[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:13.060]
these lepers need to go get a better radio okay so they're all making it up even Phil Ladsman

[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:17.940]
absolutely they're probably going to be stuck out in the cold in the edge of the transition too

[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:24.120]
okay thanks pali all right okay that's it for the calls this this thing is working really well not

[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:31.660]
with this with these toll free lines good thing you you tried that experiment there otherwise you

[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:38.540]
start getting like you know you wonder right I mean uh-huh you wonder wonder what's going on now

[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:43.820]
what do you think about the streaming thing there do you think it's just a coincidence who knows

[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:47.320]
this building's been having so many problems nothing amazes me now I don't have a jolly Joe said

[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:51.300]
in that email said it's only during your show the technical problems is that why the big old one

[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:57.040]
off how many times yesterday a couple a couple of times off the year entirely but it's only during

[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:05.880]
your show Neil and said new studio and blah blah blah blah yeah right here's that the toll free

[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:09.180]
number all over there's no point in giving it out if line one is ringing because that's the only one

[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:15.860]
that works so we got a whole bunch of lines on there just that most of them don't work right WQAM

[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:21.520]
hello good afternoon you are you today good evening yes sir hey um just want to let you know another

[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:27.700]
single uh spy watch I'm in jupiter and I'm getting you pretty good I mean I hear the occasional rumbling

[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:32.340]
of lightning and uh you know I hear a little Cuban music in the background every now and then

[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:39.460]
love cool caracters yeah but regarding sleep must be a nice guy but there's nothing that's really

[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:45.200]
upset me more that when you ask him a question and the dude has like no clue what you're talking about

[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:49.840]
and that sort of makes me miss George but we know there's nothing we can do about that but just

[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:54.220]
thought I'd give that comment have a great day Neil okay thanks well you get him upset when you have

[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:59.120]
uh we know when you don't know I'm talking like Bill Cullen for example but I will say this

[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:04.460]
flea is very quick on the googling though man the thing about he had polio you had that within 10

[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:10.400]
seconds yesterday I'm trying man you're quick on the googling now I have no complaints you've been

[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:21.780]
real trooper but as all good things must come to an end oh boy you talk about stupid

[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:26.820]
the I guess they think this is really going to work huh I guess streaming is down nobody can

[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:31.960]
hear the signal between ten and two and um oh but those people with the meters out there oh boy

[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:38.620]
oh geez they're not you're not compelling them to listen real long and the the the concept of

[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:46.480]
this is so idiotic if people aren't listening on the panel to your show you could do the greatest

[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:50.480]
the most cidalating the most compelling radio in the history of the industry and it doesn't make

[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.240]
any difference because they're not listening anyway is there like a lightning bolt it comes down

[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:58.220]
from the sky says oh you better turn on Neil right now he's doing really compelling radio this

[01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:04.140]
second even you chuckle at that is that the dumbest thing you've ever heard of in your life it's

[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:09.740]
pretty idiotic yeah idiotic that's from flea not from me idiotic

[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:17.820]
everybody is tired do you say it they're well WQA and hello

[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:23.080]
Neil the boyfriend is back with a vengeance give him a chance he'll get your waiting way up there

[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:31.000]
WQA and hello I like compelling radio I mean who the heck doesn't I also often like

[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:34.760]
compelling skinny men they call them twins you know

[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:45.480]
WQA QA hello hey Neil how you doing okay let me give you the real deal I was in sweet water

[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:51.900]
and I travel to the Jackson hospital area sweet water is down there flying

[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:56.480]
got to the Jackson hospital area it sounds like crap if you'd like I put I could put the

[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:03.080]
phone to the speaker go ahead okay hold on I mean go ahead I mean go ahead

[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:12.840]
oh WQA how's that sir waves how's that waves didn't make you very very little

[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:18.900]
doubt now I mean it sounded fine and then it sounded like crap so I don't I think it's just

[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:23.760]
the area it's more in the area in the oven okay well get out of the ocean man all right I love

[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.580]
you Sean man thanks yeah it's not what it sounds like sounds like the waves are rolling in like

[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:32.660]
the like they're in cocoa beaches somewhere where the you know the tide is coming in yeah the ocean

[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:38.200]
the ocean the big waves are coming down time to get surfing folks let's play some surfing music

[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:42.880]
hey well listen you got to go with the flow that's what Joe says you know you got to find out

[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:47.100]
what works and what doesn't work and that might be compelling surfing music in the sound of the waves

[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:52.360]
get a little dicked ale going no the beach boys catch a wave I love that song catch a wave not

[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:55.540]
one of their big hits but nevertheless I'm I'm not sure it was ever a single I don't think it was

[01:17:56.660 --> 01:18:00.180]
you know that song catch a wave you could play it if you had the library there but you don't and I've

[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:03.360]
got it here somewhere no but I should have it by this weekend George said he was going to come by one

[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:09.700]
day this week and download the songs how's he doing by the way pretty good I guess well what does that

[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:14.640]
mean I guess he is doing pretty good because he's not here right oh the day that the day he walked out

[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:20.140]
of that place for the last time believe you me he has no idea how fortunate he was

[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:27.440]
we want Neil on more during the summertime because we're afraid George isn't going to cut it with the

[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:32.020]
yeah right though you but you better cut it you better do some gigantic numbers in there with

[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:37.840]
that new technology you better talk really loud and you better not have PD Lenny on there during

[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:44.280]
the summer months or during any other month you know PD Lenny my ass that that's just I mean anybody

[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:49.440]
who thinks that's compelling did anybody come to you and say how come you put that moron on the

[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:55.520]
no not really well why not I don't know that would have been something you should have been suspended

[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:04.240]
for five years for that less than learning like I've always said and this is one true thing in life

[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.060]
there are a few things worse than people who think they're funny who are not

[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:15.060]
and if you look up look up that saying in the web series dictionary you'll find PD Lenny's picture

[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:23.440]
next to it someone who thinks he's funny and he ain't this dick cany I'd like to relax by having

[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:27.240]
Mary Magdalen massage my balls while listening to the Neil Rogers 12 to 1 hour VP

[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:56.760]

[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.020]
You're fair.

[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:23.780]
I got a high deputy screen that helps me see his bones.

[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:28.740]
I could do love I want to but I ain't gonna never get none.

[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:31.320]
No day's up I'm busy school.

[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:33.080]
Okay that's not so great.

[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.040]
But I'm just gonna know that you'll mountaineat.

[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:37.600]
At least until he's 28.

[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.140]
I'm great now.

[01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:42.640]
I want some weight.

[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:48.180]
You ain't seen no man quite like gravy with rock solid.

[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:56.760]
Oh baby wow look at that kid you ain't seen no man quite like gravy with.

[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:04.180]
Probably one is five sixty WQ on the dow is down thirty points not a big deal not a big

[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:06.640]
stimulus okay maybe we ought to cut the Yiddish out too.

[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:07.780]
You think?

[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:08.620]
What do you think?

[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:08.980]
No.

[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:12.620]
You think the goyama they're upset because they don't understand the Yiddish words.

[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.660]
I think I'm doing a public and public service.

[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.620]
I actually enjoy learning it.

[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:17.540]
See there you go.

[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.680]
I taught George tons of you this year over the years.

[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:24.180]
Yeah I printed out like I printed out like three pages of of words so I'm studying.

[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:27.500]
Yeah well you you have a long way to go.

[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.820]
Yeah WQ way am hello.

[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:32.540]
Hey Neil that's the sound that everyone's hearing in the background.

[01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:33.800]
I don't think it's an accident.

[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:37.860]
I think Joe program didn't you want everyone to know when your show sounds like.

[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:41.080]
You walk on day today with his own head up his ass you don't know what he's doing.

[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:46.920]
Well also there's a big last week we'll head to Perflict because I know he's got to spend

[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:47.560]
it for five weeks.

[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.080]
There's a video he's playing with the word HJ and it you better be careful.

[01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:54.760]
I know you you block that word out one of your bits.

[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.400]
They won't word I'm saying.

[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.080]
We're AJ.

[01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.540]
HJ like BJ.

[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:00.400]
HJ instead.

[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:01.360]
Oh hand.

[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:02.200]
Yeah.

[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.300]
Yeah we don't do that.

[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:06.740]
I mean we might do it but we don't say it.

[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:11.480]
You you played it or you said it no I played it.

[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:11.760]
Oh.

[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.560]
You played it out of the DCS.

[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:18.280]
No.

[01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:21.100]
It was another thing that I got off the onion.

[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:22.380]
Oh boy.

[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:24.720]
I smell another arrest for you.

[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:27.180]
You better listen you got to do the whole show next week.

[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:29.040]
You can court us on vacation next week.

[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:34.160]
And then when I come back to summer schedule so you know unless I decide to work extra days

[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.000]
during the summertime.

[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:41.920]
If you cared about the show you see that this business that with head games you know

[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:47.560]
doesn't work with me because it's so transparent trying to embarrass me like all of a sudden

[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:51.620]
I've lost it and I'm desperate and I'm floundering and if I cared about the show I would give

[01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:55.880]
them extra time during the summertime over my dead body okay like I said hire a hitman

[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:57.100]
that's the only way it's going to work.

[01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:59.040]
How are freaking hitman.

[01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:06.160]
When you make a deal with people if you're honorable in the least bit you live up to

[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:06.520]
it.

[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.480]
Whatever the contract says that's the way it goes down.

[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:13.920]
Not OG if you cared you give us more time during the summer.

[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:14.220]
No.

[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:15.200]
No.

[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:16.960]
Ink gonna happen.

[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:18.620]
I'm disappointed in your response.

[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.240]
I'm disappointed in your suggestion.

[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:20.940]
How do you like that?

[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.460]
I'm appalled at your suggestion.

[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.700]
Building collapses near Rolly North Carolina.

[01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:27.320]
Look at that.

[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:28.900]
There's a big old satellite.

[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.240]
Don't it's not a satellite dish.

[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.600]
And as you can see there from one of the.

[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:36.120]
Con agro foods they had a major explosion near Rolly.

[01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:39.300]
I wonder if Jolly Rolly Joe knows about that.

[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:43.140]
Chad talking about a triage area that has been.

[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.200]
Well you talk about boring.

[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:45.220]
You hear Tony Harris there.

[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:47.540]
He could put you into a coma in two seconds or less.

[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:48.320]
Not compelling.

[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:48.880]
Oh yeah.

[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:55.340]
Sam in Boston says I'm typing this just as you read the email from a listener saying

[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:59.020]
that the streamer window said we will reconnect in 64 seconds then

[01:23:59.020 --> 01:23:59.540]
crap out.

[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:00.840]
I got the exact same message.

[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:04.740]
It wouldn't connect for a few minutes but after a few tries it eventually did come back.

[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:06.300]
They came back.

[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:09.280]
Here's the best email of all time from the fake Greg Budell.

[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:10.700]
Talent coach.

[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:13.580]
Sonny Fox says you need a talent coach.

[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:15.420]
Said his buddy Tommy Kramer is available.

[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:16.980]
He worked wonders for Ron and Ron.

[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.720]
Old white haired Tommy Kramer.

[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.520]
Well you know why didn't do drugs back in the 60s when everybody else was doing drug.

[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:27.440]
But you're sure as how could fool me talk about a radio burnout Tommy Kramer.

[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:28.880]
He was the talent coach.

[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:31.080]
He was good buddies with buddy Bud Paxon by the way.

[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:31.460]
Really?

[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.180]
And you know something in red in retrospect buddy Bud Paxon started to look really good.

[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:37.040]
Oh yeah.

[01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:42.220]
Those were some wonderful days compared to what we got going on now.

[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:44.480]
Especially technically.

[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.380]
Come on think about IOD signal.

[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.400]
I mean you can hear it.

[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:50.260]
I know that's great.

[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:54.800]
And there's no waves rolling in the background you know like that.

[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:59.560]
Max says this will at times fail.

[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:06.220]
The streaming don't know if on QAM's end or ISP lost it several minutes ago when the Southern

[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:09.560]
Palm Beach County in several weeks I will try to pick up your station via the air waves.

[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:13.400]
PS here's the greatest line in the history of emails.

[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:19.360]
OK and it just caps off exactly what's going on now OK PS.

[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.600]
Tell management you can't measure what folks can't hear.

[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:25.440]
Wow.

[01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:26.480]
How do you like that?

[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:28.440]
You like that line?

[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:29.120]
Pretty deep.

[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:32.920]
Let me circle it and put it in my save it file.

[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:36.600]
Tell management you can't measure what folks can't hear.

[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:43.980]
You got to admit it's different.

[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:46.120]
You know when you hear another this show on QAM.

[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.600]
You won't hear those rolling waves on IOD or on a Waxi or on anywhere.

[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:57.460]
On the light bulb light bulb junior light bulb senior INZ you won't hear that.

[01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:03.000]
And it's a little bit disconcerting to me that email we got from the guy the radio technical

[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.300]
expert about this all these are just rumors about the signal and about the new stick and all

[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:08.500]
that.

[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.420]
I think he's telling me to stick it.

[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.260]
WQ I am hello.

[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.320]
One of my favorites QAM hello.

[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:23.940]
Oh that was Joyce you could tell by the tone.

[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:31.580]
Keith says 90% of my listing is online the other 10% when I'm driving is on the radio.

[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:36.800]
For sure the online sound quality is 10 times better than what the AM radio signal provides.

[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:41.240]
The streaming was working fine from the time you came on until about 1135 or so once it

[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:46.220]
dropped out I went back on but it went but I went onto the QAM site instead of near

[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:50.280]
Rogers dot com since it's clear that Joe Bell and crew are trying to destroy your show.

[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.220]
I got right back on I'm listening to a read a book.

[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:56.540]
Don't give up says Keith don't worry Keith I'm here.

[01:26:57.060 --> 01:27:00.820]
I'm here until 2 o'clock today and from attend to tomorrow and then again Thursday and Friday.

[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:06.580]
Kate says is there any way to avoid annoying streaming ads by the dodo dog duo?

[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:12.780]
I listen from your website and every time I try to listen to sure I have to put up with these annoying ads.

[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:16.800]
Are the ads or is it something you put on there what's he talking about?

[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:19.880]
Well they do get ads. There's ads there's PSAs there's Pramos.

[01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:21.600]
Well what's the dodo dog duo?

[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:22.460]
I have no idea.

[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.060]
No maybe they're spots.

[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:26.140]
Don't knock the spots Kate we need the money.

[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:27.500]
Badly. Yeah.

[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.560]
Really really badly.

[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:36.400]
Boss says yes Neil the net broadcast was down but not to worry the fabulous sports baby.

[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:42.120]
We've had Greg somebody rather on talking NASCAR and the Pepsi 403 weeks of Daytona that's compelling radio.

[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:44.940]
The fabulous sports baby is about as compelling as an elephant's fart.

[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:45.600]
Yeah.

[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:48.440]
Not compelling she really blows.

[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.980]
Remember the triathlete gave her a night there for about five minutes?

[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:51.340]
Yeah.

[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:54.500]
And even these people said oh we don't think so.

[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:55.820]
Bye bye honey.

[01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:58.640]
Whatever happened to what's her name there from Baltimore.

[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.640]
That was rumored to be coming.

[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:03.160]
I think she signed a new deal on Baltimore.

[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:03.880]
She did.

[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:04.240]
Yeah.

[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.460]
What was her name I need a marks.

[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:07.040]
I need a marks that's the one.

[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:10.040]
She's good looking from about 50 yards.

[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:17.440]
Oh now this is really bad.

[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:20.180]
You want to hear this this is a real nasty shot at you.

[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:20.700]
Oh great.

[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:22.860]
It's good for my self-esteem.

[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:30.300]
As if his mother ever had any children that lived and if it's true he tells everybody he's a vegetarian order to hide his heroin addiction.

[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.920]
They're trying to needle you a little bit.

[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.400]
You know I am going to try heroin when I'm like 65-66.

[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:37.960]
Why is that?

[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:39.680]
Because I know you like drugs but why?

[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:42.800]
Because I want to try it and I figure by then you know I won't be working I won't have to do anything.

[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:46.360]
Do you want to have that purple arm there like Gerolito and Requiem?

[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:46.700]
Yeah.

[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.080]
Purple elbow.

[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:54.940]
And why and why did that what's his name Damon Wands is that who it was?

[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.240]
Damon it was one of the Wands brothers.

[01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.180]
I don't think it was Damon though.

[01:28:59.080 --> 01:28:59.400]
No.

[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.220]
I don't think so.

[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.880]
Well whichever one it was that played the black dude in the movie.

[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:03.160]
Yeah.

[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:04.380]
Why he could call him Jim.

[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.300]
Hey Jim is that is that an ethnic thing?

[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.060]
I don't I don't get that or a drug thing one.

[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:09.500]
I don't know it as a drug reference.

[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:13.540]
I mean his name was Harry you know.

[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:16.000]
I mean I realize there aren't a whole lot of black dudes named Harry.

[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:16.420]
No.

[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:17.780]
But still.

[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.660]
530 votes on the pool.

[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:23.460]
Wow that's not that's not too shabby when you come right down to it.

[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:25.560]
530.

[01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:30.500]
Here we go Jason's got a good idea.

[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:34.420]
The five top things to make Neil show more compelling.

[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:37.760]
One do four hours of all gay programming.

[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:44.100]
Two change your handle the Neil the talk animal Roger three advertise your show billboards.

[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:49.480]
Four have a signal that people can hear and five son up footy and do the Neil and footy show.

[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:50.560]
Oh yeah they will do it.

[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:54.760]
Only trying to help it says once again watch your back with flea he's not on your side.

[01:29:55.720 --> 01:30:00.720]
Well what do you expect from a heroin addict not yet have a great day I'm turning into your car

[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:03.840]
and your competitor station that I can hear it says but that's bad.

[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:08.480]
Because this is Chester copper pot real chronic regular.

[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:08.940]
Yeah.

[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:12.860]
And if he's tuning it out because he can't hear the station not a good sign.

[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:17.260]
Management needs to know you can't measure what folks can't hear.

[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:18.360]
Oh Neil.

[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.080]
You know fund us lucky.

[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:25.740]
Here's everybody.

[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:30.260]
Hey everybody all the time.

[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:31.000]
Absolutely.

[01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:34.660]
That's the will life in plaster.

[01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:43.900]
For it's my great man and I'm in hospital.

[01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:47.020]
He's been down.

[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:49.520]
Everybody.

[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:52.940]
Hey everybody all the time.

[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:57.820]
Driving on a tolerance and fear.

[01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:04.440]
It's where this approach is for the gate.

[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:09.280]
And they don't want to hear.

[01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:15.020]
You find their attitude quite sour.

[01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:20.600]
When I'm a shatter they threaten us like you to the fall.

[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:26.580]
A right there in the gridlock of rush hour.

[01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:32.420]
I though when no someone calls you mad at all.

[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.220]
Everybody.

[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:38.920]
Hey everybody all the time.

[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:43.600]
Know how long that is you can do.

[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:52.400]
Something the priest is walking from Papano.

[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:58.700]
He was right 1217 at 560 WDQM.

[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:02.180]
What have we done compelling in the last 60 seconds or you ought to get a stopwatch going.

[01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:02.580]
Okay.

[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:11.860]
And every 60 seconds we can just stop for you know pause for a moment and say okay where we compelling last 60 seconds or what.

[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:15.200]
I don't know where the hell that thing is.

[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.140]
Oh here it is.

[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.560]
Yeah we could we could do that.

[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:24.040]
At least keep the day in the audience way.

[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.820]
I know it sounds really good in the middle of all those crashing waves on the shore.

[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:32.540]
Here's a guy in Yelm Washington.

[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:34.800]
YELM.

[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:37.640]
And this is about the poll.

[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:42.120]
He says greater use of the option WTF would be appreciated by some of your weird and or elderly fans.

[01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:44.420]
And two I don't like sports is too exclusive.

[01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:47.520]
I don't like spectator sports might be better on the other hand.

[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:49.680]
I like baseball in any way shape or form.

[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:52.940]
Says somebody in Yelm.

[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:55.980]
I think the poll is sufficient.

[01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.760]
I don't think we need any additions to you.

[01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:58.860]
No where is Yelm?

[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:00.740]
You're asking me?

[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:01.960]
You were in Yelm Washington.

[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:02.920]
YELM.

[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.780]
TR says question for you Neil.

[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:11.780]
Was that email you read earlier actually real or from a fake?

[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:12.460]
It was real.

[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:15.860]
He's talking about the one from Joe Bell.

[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:19.640]
If that was a true email for management the hubris involved is breathtaking.

[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:22.680]
Breath taking doesn't come close to describing it.

[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:24.360]
Negative.

[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:27.300]
Everybody's tired of bat.

[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:28.900]
Nobody wants to hear bat.

[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:30.280]
On and on and on.

[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:36.880]
Sorry to see you going through this but we fans adore you and that as had is only galvanizing your fans to rally behind you.

[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:38.560]
Keep on keeping on Neil since TR.

[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:40.520]
Yeah it was real.

[01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:41.940]
How can I make that up?

[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:44.880]
It was real nauseating.

[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:49.240]
Everybody's tired of this and everybody's tired of you and everybody's tired of bat.

[01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:52.340]
I'm tired of him.

[01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:56.840]
Of course he's your buddy so you're kind of in between a rock and a hard place.

[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:57.700]
Oh yeah.

[01:33:58.080 --> 01:33:58.300]
What?

[01:33:58.660 --> 01:33:59.000]
Oh yeah.

[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.160]
What were you just looking up?

[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:02.040]
Yelm?

[01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:02.820]
Yelm Washington.

[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:04.440]
Where is it?

[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:06.880]
Let's see.

[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:10.520]
Not compelling all that I've been sighing in dead air now.

[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.060]
It's not close to anything so it's kind of hard to say.

[01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:14.340]
Okay well who cares?

[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:14.560]
Right.

[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:15.780]
Keep it concise man.

[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:18.960]
Nobody gives a flying fig where the hell Yelm Washington is.

[01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:23.840]
It's about 25 miles east of Olympia.

[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:24.780]
East of Yenomsville.

[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:25.180]
Right.

[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:26.240]
WQAM hello.

[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:28.740]
QAM.

[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:29.580]
QAM hello.

[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:30.960]
Yelm.

[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:32.060]
Hola.

[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:32.900]
Hello.

[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:33.960]
Yes sir.

[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:36.300]
I have the fine kind of fine.

[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:37.300]
I have the fine kind of fine.

[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:37.300]

[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:38.920]
I have the fine kind of fine.

[01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:41.780]
I have the fine kind of fine.

[01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:42.720]
I have the fine kind of fine.

[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:43.040]

[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:45.260]
WQAM hello.

[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:46.600]
Right now.

[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:47.660]
This is Jenny.

[01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:48.740]
This is for three.

[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:49.280]
It's three.

[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:50.120]
You remember me?

[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:51.080]
Sure.

[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:52.900]
Yeah.

[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:53.040]

[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:54.040]
You're doing your faggot.

[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:55.860]
No.

[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:56.280]
No.

[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:56.340]
No.

[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:03.800]
WQAM hello.

[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:07.400]
Oh that was muffled.

[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.160]
You could barely hear it.

[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:08.600]
What is she aim?

[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:08.900]
Yeah.

[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.020]
Captain Diableto says it's a good thing.

[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:16.500]
If it wasn't compelling radio, why would you have listeners of over 20 years out of the area,

[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:18.580]
still listening on the internet and very strong numbers?

[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:21.960]
I'm listening in the DC marketplace because there's a dearth of compelling radio here.

[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:23.140]
Yeah.

[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:27.480]
What about all those people we have listening online, which we were very, you know, there's nothing

[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:31.280]
I'm questionable about those stats on the stats page.

[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:35.860]
On my website and on the QM.com, which Cortus used to tell me about it,

[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:40.380]
and you've told me about it how we have far more people listening online than any of the sports stations on the,

[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:41.600]
shows on the station.

[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:42.020]
Yep.

[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:44.700]
Always having always do and still do.

[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:48.760]
So if the whole audience disappeared April 1st, how come they didn't disappear online?

[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:49.880]
Jolly Joe.

[01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:52.580]
Oh, don't confuse him with the facts.

[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:53.200]
I don't know.

[01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:56.000]
This is what we have to live with now.

[01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:56.940]
This is what we got now.

[01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:58.140]
We have to learn to play the game.

[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:01.520]
Unfortunately, it says that's the mindset that's permeated the business.

[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.980]
Watch palaciously gather in statistics to develop policy, kind of like many political leaders of years past.

[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:11.100]
I know you've had a significant significant number of suggestions.

[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:15.600]
At the risk of raising your iron is the model of podcasts or internet radio completely abhorrent?

[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:18.180]
It's completely impractical is what it is.

[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:23.180]
You can get the ad dollars, have no restrictions on content, charge for podcast downloads, etc.

[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:27.200]
And with very little alteration in your home studio, the only loss might be caller interaction.

[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:29.760]
But look at the quality of that as a rule. Yeah. Like recently.

[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:35.160]
Some schedule call time, same schedule, call times daily and record those it's a thought.

[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:36.520]
What?

[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:42.000]
I hope you find some resolution, but I'm not overly confident says the captain.

[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:44.640]
He's not overly confident, neither am I.

[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:50.920]
That was really something to hear that again today.

[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:53.060]
Okay, here this will give you an example.

[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:56.980]
This is yesterday for the online listing at noon.

[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:04.780]
Your show had 450 people listing on the QAM website at 4 p.m.

[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:05.880]
There was 69.

[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:07.860]
Really?

[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:08.300]
Yeah.

[01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:09.860]
How do you explain that?

[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:11.520]
How do you explain that?

[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:13.140]
Fat ass Joe?

[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:17.800]
And most of the statistics can't be fudged if I can say that.

[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:19.160]
Can I still say that? I don't think so.

[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:21.360]
Well, and here's another stat too.

[01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:24.960]
Yeah, I mean, if you go back another day, 6-4, which would have been, I think Thursday?

[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.240]
Yeah, 445 at noon.

[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:31.140]
165 at 4 o'clock.

[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:33.480]
Wow.

[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:39.160]
Well, let me take a look and see how many we got have listened.

[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:41.840]
See ours isn't at the moment on our website.

[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:43.300]
Right.

[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:45.640]
Our stats are cumulative.

[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:50.520]
In other words, this is the number of people who have been listening online during the show since 10 o'clock today.

[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:53.720]
624 on ours.

[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:56.140]
Wow, and here's another stat for you.

[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:56.740]
Wow.

[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.740]
At 11.30, before they had the problem with the streaming.

[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:00.500]
Uh-huh.

[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:02.660]
There was 416 people listening online.

[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:03.280]
Right.

[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:09.520]
At 11.50 because of the problems with the streaming, it dropped to 223.

[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:10.140]
Wow.

[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:13.080]
We lost half the audience online because of the streaming, yep.

[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:14.820]
Because of more technical difficulties.

[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:21.160]
Like somebody, like a brilliant radio philosopher once said, you can't measure what people can't hear.

[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:25.200]
Don't, don't, don't, don't, how do you like that?

[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:27.240]
We're screaming about the streaming.

[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:31.500]
Those are pretty impressive numbers though.

[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:32.440]
Those first ones you gave me.

[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:32.760]
Yeah.

[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:34.160]
445 is compared to 165.

[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:36.800]
And always the one 1660 something.

[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.060]
Yeah, 65, yeah.

[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:38.640]
65.

[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:41.640]
That's not even worth a bother.

[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:43.920]
I cut off the stream.

[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:48.300]
Sometimes it's hard to cut off the stream, especially when your bladder is like really loaded.

[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:54.240]
I'll tell you with me, I drink a lot of the diet sodas, which is bad because they got caffeine.

[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:57.180]
They don't have caffeine-free diet sodas that would buy.

[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:58.200]
Not spray, huh?

[01:38:58.980 --> 01:38:59.200]
No.

[01:38:59.460 --> 01:38:59.940]
That's a shame.

[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:00.560]
That's the best one.

[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:02.420]
But at any rate, I drink just tons of them.

[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:07.320]
Of course, they love me because I always tip them, uh, a lunae or a tuni, one or two bucks, when they bring me the drink.

[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:11.580]
They see me and they all come running, oh, you want another diet?

[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:12.400]
Would you like another diet?

[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:13.060]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:20.920]
So all of a sudden, you know, you're in the middle of playing your machine and then nature starts calling and your bladder is just ready to explode.

[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:24.700]
And it's a long schlep from the wheel of torture machines to the teabroom.

[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:25.660]
Oh my god.

[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:29.020]
There have been times when I could feel like a little dribble.

[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:31.180]
You know, I felt like a basketball guy, like Pete Mirovich.

[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:32.980]
He's still dead, right?

[01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:33.640]
Pistol P?

[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:34.280]
I believe so.

[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:35.560]
Pistol P is still dead.

[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:36.740]
Damn it.

[01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:41.860]
Yeah, there was a thing on one of the classic sports channels the other day about pistol P.

[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:43.800]
I watch it for about, I don't know, 15 seconds.

[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:46.640]
And then I thought, boy, this is not very compelling.

[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:47.780]
This is boring.

[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.180]
God is it boring?

[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.080]
And I turned it off.

[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:53.020]
I turned it to some movie or something.

[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:56.740]
I turned it to horse racing, which I know a lot of people think it's not very compelling.

[01:39:57.620 --> 01:39:58.760]
Here's a HL hockey.

[01:39:58.920 --> 01:39:59.620]
Here's the Marley's.

[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:00.160]
All right, Chuck.

[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:01.880]
Right up underneath the shield too.

[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:07.880]
It's a good thing that clocks and actually Matt at the Rico Coliseum.

[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:10.080]
Maybe it's the Toronto Marley's.

[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:10.780]
Any interest?

[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:14.260]
No, Chicago has two high high end, you know, top one, two picks.

[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:18.080]
How about the classic NFL football?

[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:20.340]
Let's build our own wall of football.

[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:22.700]
What's the combo?

[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:23.340]
It's in the giant.

[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:26.480]
Yeah, it's a little awkward.

[01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:30.720]
And he revealed this week that there's pressure glass bruce.

[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:31.260]
That's a great thing.

[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:32.820]
He actually has a torn leg of that.

[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:37.200]
Seriously, can you tell me, can you identify any other human or subhuman on the face of the globe?

[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:38.760]
Whose name is Plexico?

[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:39.600]
Plexico.

[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:40.320]
Not at all.

[01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:46.920]
And the thing with the sports nerds is no matter what the name is, it's like, oh yeah, well that's his name.

[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:48.480]
You know, it's just that's his name.

[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:51.100]
X-ray hip or whatever.

[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:51.900]
What was that guy's name?

[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:53.840]
Extra hip, X-ray hip.

[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:55.880]
Coco Chris.

[01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:56.740]
Coco Chris.

[01:40:56.900 --> 01:40:57.560]
Yeah, he plays baseball.

[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:03.640]
All of these things goes along with the silliness of the sports nerds.

[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:06.720]
But again, we're building a wall of football and we're in the way of the wall of football.

[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:07.620]
I think that's the problem.

[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:10.080]
We're standing in the way of the wall of football.

[01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:13.720]
I mean, it's, you know, it's the ninth of June.

[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.500]
Don't you want, aren't you thinking about football right now?

[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:16.000]
Oh, yeah.

[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:17.780]
I'm not.

[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:20.160]
That guy who called me yesterday.

[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:23.100]
What do you think Tom Brady is going to ever be the same, how do I know?

[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:25.940]
See, this is what the sports nerds talk about.

[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:28.560]
They conjecture a lot of crap that nobody could possibly know.

[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:30.020]
You think the Yankees are going to win the pennant?

[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:32.600]
I sure hope not, but who cares, you know, like that.

[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:36.420]
12 times now, he's been fired upon in this hockey game.

[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:37.940]
I think the blue day is going to win a pennant.

[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:40.700]
No, there are a bunch of chokers choking gagging dogs.

[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:43.340]
Although I'll tell you, Doc holiday, man, he's the hell of a pitcher.

[01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:43.880]
Oh, yeah.

[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:46.640]
When you like to have him on the Marlins?

[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:47.340]
Yeah.

[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:49.540]
Well, he's the first 10 game winner in the American League this year, right?

[01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:50.440]
He's great.

[01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:51.700]
The doc.

[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:57.360]
You know, I've never been in the Roger Center, even though it's named after me.

[01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.400]
I've never been in the skydome.

[01:41:58.660 --> 01:41:58.800]
Ever.

[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:01.580]
And that's sad.

[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:01.960]
Yeah.

[01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:04.540]
And on really nice days, of course, they open up the roof.

[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:07.360]
And you know, it's just it would be a pleasure to be in there watching a ballgame.

[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:11.240]
If I had any interest in it, but I don't.

[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.200]
Holy macken on.

[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:18.700]
This is Joe Boehn, the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and you're listening to the hockey authority, Neil God.

[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:20.060]
What's the obsession with hockey?

[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:26.000]
Jimmy and Danny, Jimmy and Danny, And Jimmy.

[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:26.860]

Jimmy and Danny.

[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:41.800]
Jimmy and Danny and Jimmy.

[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:44.420]

Hi, can you hear me okay.

[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:47.380]

[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:57.900]

[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:06.460]
do have a lot of work to do man so you give us a bum steer I did I was right on the

[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:12.780]
waxy numbers I was just off on ours waxies were bad those were correct yeah but they had a

[01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:19.120]
two point three way to it when they have a 0.7 0.7 they had a 0.5 right so if you put them together

[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:31.420]
you still got nothing I think that it's concise it's compelling and it's a short and sweet

[01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:36.180]
to the point oh yeah remember I was saying we ought to just keep playing that over and over again

[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:41.500]
mm-hmm I think that would do it it fits in the so we're really screwed with this panel you know

[01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:50.360]
seems like it 0.5 my ass and 18 to 49 person way like a 0.2 I just looked at some of that crap

[01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:55.060]
well this is what we have to live with now and this is where it's at yeah right

[01:49:57.500 --> 01:50:01.160]
run run they're doing they're succeeding because they're doing compelling radio

[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:07.100]
is there anybody in the free world who believes that no I mean that's just silly

[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:12.420]
for those phones man that is a door nail 5 6 7 0 5 60 that's because I haven't been taking any calls

[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:17.680]
and also because most of the lines don't work and pound 5 60 on the Verizon and 18 T wireless line

[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:25.580]
and toll free from all over the universe or at least within about a 10 mile radius 1 8 7 7 7 8 5 6 3 4

[01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:37.820]

[01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:55.840]
if you don't mind me giving you a little radio critique is that okay yeah go ahead

[01:50:55.840 --> 01:51:01.420]

[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:30.680]
WQ AM hello Neil hello okay Neil I wanted to ask you are did George get any favorite what

[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:36.500]

[01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:41.220]
got severance pay yes did he get any yeah I don't know how much he got some

[01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:55.100]
my I hope he did yeah and you suck my WQ AM hello yes sir yes how are you I just want to

[01:51:55.100 --> 01:52:04.220]
tell you that I keep on hearing like a different radio station popping in what do you mean

[01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:09.560]
uh what do I mean it keeps on like I can hear somebody talking in the background really

[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:14.740]
yeah and like where where are you listening uh on the radio my car

[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:20.900]
well we're like geographically we're like in uh on Mars Uranus what we're what part of town

[01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:27.820]
um and um in Tamarack oh it's like that every day for how long

[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:34.040]
since I've been listening to you an F Joe Bell okay thanks

[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:40.280]
since he's been listening to me it's been that way so maybe this is nothing new the

[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:43.620]
parents says the hissing noises not just an over the ear thing I'm listening on the net

[01:52:43.620 --> 01:52:49.680]
when you and Flea bag were both quiet I could hear the ocean sound the emailers were talking about

[01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:55.780]
do you believe that no because that kind of hisses me off

[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:03.460]
of course you can't measure what you can't hear but nevertheless I think they're going to work

[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:07.960]
us down to uh oh oh and then say oh well we can't put you on here we can't pay you for uh you

[01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:14.620]
know no share no two yeah I'm sitting here laughing because I was looking at the number two station

[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:21.520]
yeah and mornings men 2554 yes Mia MIA yeah

[01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:26.560]
guess a lot of 35 40 year old guys listening to Madonna

[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:31.560]
well how about the coast the coast always got big numbers on here and uh who what what

[01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:36.860]
guys 2554 listen to the coast yeah coast was fifth in the morning and number one in mid days

[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:41.940]
really and in afternoons you there you go men 2554 huh

[01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:52.200]
oh George says not our George but another George I'm a long time list of occasional email or

[01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:56.960]
the flea is doing just fine and you guys will eventually develop a good chemistry as far as George

[01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:01.080]
I really do miss him and I was thinking how about we start a George fund and get him the new

[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:05.700]
car that the beesleys will never get him hey have a list of his mail-in checks with donations and when

[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:09.460]
you get enough for down payment you can buy them the vet then you can make the monthly payments for

[01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:13.520]
George you know all these people tell me what to do first of all I did I did make the monthly

[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:19.380]
payments for George for years on two or three different cars how do you like that that was part

[01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:24.240]
of the deal with the understanding we had and so that would be a token of your appreciation for all

[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:27.440]
the years that George spent making your show better especially when you were gone after all he

[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:33.300]
stole your friend ps gocans oh that that tells me everything I need to know

[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:44.860]
wqa m hello qa m hello nail yeah I'm important Lucy man I can hear you my loud and clear but clear

[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:52.540]
yeah yeah that's good we had the whole audience in Port St. Lucie I guess we'd be kick-ass right

[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:59.420]
what do you say he said baba army I guess that's the new baba booey but for baba oh baba baba booey

[01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:06.300]
baba arny so baba loves bunches in due to believe there huh no he hasn't he hasn't what hasn't done

[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:10.620]
well since a maybe he's not compelling maybe hulk ogan isn't compelling to the audience in South

[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:19.900]
Florida wow that's true because we obviously are not as of April 1 Ron says Neil I didn't ever think

[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:26.020]
to talk about George going to get fired was a joke but surely this joe bel thing is gotta be

[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:32.260]
stick to boost ratings right wrong wrong wrong Ron is as much stick as George getting can wish

[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:39.140]
stick we don't do a stick on his show okay so stick it it's for real it's the amus but once we get

[01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:43.600]
the consultants in here and once we start with the ding dong school they're gonna teach us how to

[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:47.000]
be really compelling and keep the audience glued to us even though the people on the panel don't

[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:53.280]
listen to us in the first place those numbers for the sports I mean when you read the

[01:55:53.280 --> 01:56:00.400]
Q number is those were awesome there was a scary yeah but that's not the no as I remember we're

[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:08.600]
looking at average quarter hour were marginal not as marginal as us but then who is WQAM hello

[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:21.840]
oh hello oh does it meal speaking hi Neil I just want to tell you that I enjoy your show I like the way

[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:28.080]
you use different names for words the way you do the play on words and keep doing it I you're the

[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:34.040]
star yeah I'm gonna listen to you for for a number of years I moved out of state and I haven't

[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:41.280]
heard you and I then you back your promise ever okay thanks pali you're the best ever great day I know

[01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:46.920]
used to be anyway used to be till about a month and a half ago and then all the sudden that's it

[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:52.100]
yeah what had done you done righteous you done you've finished the that was done four and a half

[01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:57.440]
points is making a comeback it's gonna go green pretty soon man it's going to go into positive territory

[01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:05.560]
WQAM hello good afternoon sir good to hear you back on the air back on the phone how you doing

[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:10.940]
well what do you mean back on here where have I been no I mean you had been taking a phone called

[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:18.100]
for a while frankly I don't blame you I find it amazing how people are always willing to

[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:24.440]
that one male I guess that was email who was saying state culture for George that didn't have

[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:30.200]
a check attached to it no it did not no it did not yes I'm always amazed and I'm the

[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:34.380]
the whineiest liberal there is but when people are always willing to tell how people have

[01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:39.280]
to spend their money right that's right and it's unfortunate but I think George the very intelligent

[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:45.460]
guy he will end on his feet as just as you did all the time that the corporate has posed you over the

[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:55.240]
years I hope so he deserves it he does he does I you know I God knows this market needs some

[01:57:55.240 --> 01:58:01.900]
ang English language talking at the side support as those numbers you know you can do with some

[01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:14.800]
I think you know I don't know any way to bypass the arbitrage system but I know I don't hear

[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:20.960]
out there listening to everybody at least in the circles I travel and they all agree that

[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:26.200]
radiance out for things the music selection things most of them I won't use the name but they've

[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:31.560]
gravitated either satellite or CDs in their car but they don't accept pretend to do they listen

[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:37.280]
to you sir okay thanks a lot of pelling take care now okay just got another email from your buddy Joe

[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:41.800]
Bell who gives me the day parts which is if we hadn't already figured that out we don't want to

[01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:46.020]
spend too much time talking about it because it's not compelling and it's not concise and it's

[01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:51.020]
boring well I guess he just wanted to point out to me that we are sucking in the one three was a

[01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:56.560]
flute and we're back to fractions again like he believes it and I'm I'm supposed to believe it do you

[01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:02.900]
believe it yeah take Larry King says show sounds great again love the mix of calls and emails true

[01:59:02.900 --> 01:59:09.560]
compelling radio is the anxious mr. radio would say Rick Shaw would be proud oh my god

[01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:16.240]
I was wrong about the doubt by the way it's down seven points now just it can't turn it can't

[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:21.960]
turn the corner like us when you said we had the 2.0 I thought oh my god that's gotta be but we don't

[01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:28.760]
so what they're gonna say is oh well the one three was a fluke point 2.4.5 what's the point

[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:35.460]
Pedro says Pedro you sound like there's a snake in the background I listen on the net

[01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:42.440]
says I like flee but I miss George like there's a snake hissing in the background I hear a slight

[01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:49.320]
hiss from your microphone like when you cut your mic off I get clear but I'm wearing headphones too

[01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:59.020]
okay back on yeah I hear you hear what I hear a hiss with your mic so you should turn your

[01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:11.540]
mic off it clears up yep nothing hiss nothing hiss nothing hiss hiss we could do that so to a clock

[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:19.060]
kill some good time that's compelling that is here's somebody who says I just got off the pulmonary

[02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:23.700]
expressway I feel like I'm ready to vomit listening to your signal well it felt like I was jamming

[02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:29.000]
on the brakes and then ramming on the gas pedal I feel like I just exited a carnival ride it's

[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.420]
just on to me why the pulsing signal sounded so familiar have you ever seen the movie contact with

[02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:40.420]
jody foster now bad horrible and the movie earth is contacted by aliens via radio pulse signal

[02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:45.560]
that used prime numbers a phone of prime numbers as it means a communication what does that mean

[02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:50.600]
I guess the count on the phone jody opened up the message there was a picture of Adolf Hitler giving

[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:54.700]
a speech at the Berlin Olympics you think joebell might be trying to send your listeners a subliminal

[02:00:54.700 --> 02:01:04.560]
message says nauseous and the ranger a pulsing signal he says he feels like he just exited a carnival

[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:09.780]
ride pulses there's certainly is a slight hissing noise that comes through on the streaming that

[02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:13.600]
doesn't seem to be there when you're not on the year or flea guest hosting so must be coming from

[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:19.700]
this end says forget about the consultants I'm sure you can teach them a thing or two about

[02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:22.560]
broadcasting good job last Friday flea says Paul yeah

[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:28.720]
rasta paul says a couple of me friends in myself I'd like to know if you ever smoke the gondramon

[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:34.940]
I say no way but bonk factory warehouse manager godfried says he thinks you've smoked even if

[02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:37.940]
you claim you did not anymore we are compelled to know no I don't smoke

[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:45.900]
this one says do a few minutes a day and creole the ratings will soar and you can use the

[02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:52.620]
effort will pass oh my god so some of the stuff that's coming in on the emails is almost as

[02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:55.140]
good as the phone calls not quite but it's getting there

[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:59.880]
oh you yeah oh yeah it's just got the real and when I'm up in Belkettika slapping all the women

[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:05.120]
with painted lips around the pool I listen to the new Rogers one to two I mean I listen to the

[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:07.220]
new Rogers there in balance will it two hours

[02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:33.500]
what that fairy has to say if they want to smoke things are guys that what I'll have you know

[02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:38.960]
I know what I'm talking about you every morning at the condo I take the elevated down and on my way to the

[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:44.960]
car when I pull my folding basket out I give a three condo piece the toys are back and

[02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:14.520]
down I said the toys are back and down why you

[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:21.100]
look at my car all you spoiled old boots I know everything is going on in that

[02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:27.180]
room but I even know all the new magic rules I picked to the drive daddy on it

[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:35.080]
you better go and knock it out it's a better show when I take your place I know I ain't no way

[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:39.480]
clearly but when they drop my boys will change yeah little smoothie

[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:54.540]
oh

[02:03:56.100 --> 02:04:01.160]
okay let's try a little experiment okay you hear the hiss again now yes okay well let me try

[02:04:01.230 --> 02:04:14.150]
the guest mic oh how about now yeah but not as bad really yeah well let me uh slide this baby

[02:04:14.150 --> 02:04:21.470]
over here I'm on a guest mic and it sounds better sounds a little bit better yet a little bit

[02:04:23.090 --> 02:04:32.290]
well on a scale of like ten it's a set minus what a point five here he goes again with that point

[02:04:32.290 --> 02:04:39.890]
five crap why is your can't wait for a ding dong school so we can find out how to work this system oh

[02:04:39.890 --> 02:04:48.630]
yeah I wonder if they had ding dong school for Joe and mad dog and big O and the NBA tell them how to

[02:04:48.630 --> 02:04:54.670]
work it six hundred eleven votes on the pool I don't go to spectator sports often because it's

[02:04:54.670 --> 02:05:00.150]
easy to stay home and watch them on TV 266 the ticket prices are too high 160 the athletes are

[02:05:00.150 --> 02:05:06.290]
spoiling over paid 59 I don't like sports 29 food and drinks are too expensive 28 they're usually

[02:05:06.290 --> 02:05:16.050]
boring 28 not compelling I do go off in 25 too many drunken fans 10 and the weather six yeah once

[02:05:16.050 --> 02:05:20.110]
we get that dome stadium and then the marlins are going to really draw for about you know two three

[02:05:20.110 --> 02:05:26.730]
months Lauren says and the waves roll in and the waves roll out and in and out and in and out

[02:05:27.330 --> 02:05:31.610]
maybe Bella's trying to hypnotize the audience into becoming sport holes or something and said it seems

[02:05:31.610 --> 02:05:36.310]
to be having the effect of having real men 18 to 34 listen to Madonna and Brittany on other stations

[02:05:37.310 --> 02:05:41.750]
by the way it stopped briefly at five p.m. during mandatory show yesterday but clearly that was

[02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:45.970]
a temporary thing I was driving and turned it off because I was getting nauseous although I

[02:05:45.970 --> 02:05:50.290]
could have been caused by manages callers Lauren says how do you like that little shot there at the

[02:05:50.290 --> 02:05:57.630]
callers WQA M hello Neil yes sir listen to the waves don't talk for a little while listen

yeah yeah listen not stop it this started on Monday I was driving and turned it off because I was

[02:06:12.810 --> 02:06:17.290]

[02:06:17.730 --> 02:06:22.570]
okay thanks for the good news well that sounds really bad I know yeah that has nothing to do with

[02:06:22.570 --> 02:06:30.350]
your mic for sure the waves yeah yeah it's like Ontario man those big crashing waves from like Ontario

[02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:38.430]
you can't measure what people can't hear profound words of wisdom

[02:06:41.930 --> 02:06:46.770]
Richard says there definitely is a hissing sound on the web streaming I haven't heard it until today

[02:06:47.590 --> 02:06:48.470]
until today

[02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:59.690]
well let's see is it back it's still there well what do you mean it's still there now it should be less

[02:07:01.170 --> 02:07:07.610]
yeah I'm alternating between mics one and two you're on two right now right right now I'm on one

[02:07:08.170 --> 02:07:12.450]
yeah it's still there it's more now I'm on drugs I'm not thinking I'm going to start doing drugs

[02:07:12.450 --> 02:07:16.990]
heroin right no not heroin okay you're a crazy person heroin

[02:07:18.530 --> 02:07:22.870]
here here it's supposed to be so concerned about your health with your vegetarian with your

[02:07:24.170 --> 02:07:29.530]
obsessive vegetarianism and then you're going to go do heroin that tell them like 65-66

[02:07:29.530 --> 02:07:34.190]
65 my ass you're never going to make it to 65 especially working for these people these grave robbers

[02:07:34.190 --> 02:07:40.550]
that's true Brian in Jupiter says tell Flea that if I hear that Dan Christopher walk in Texas

[02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:46.150]
Ranger so-called comedy bit one more time I'll be compelled to plots on my desk how do you plots

[02:07:46.150 --> 02:07:49.930]
on your desk I don't want to know this is what happens when you've got going I'm trying to use

[02:07:49.930 --> 02:07:56.010]
the other it plays every break and it wasn't funny the first time Flea gets a new material other

[02:07:56.010 --> 02:08:01.070]
than that you're doing a great job says Brian in Jupiter you know I hate to bring up other problems

[02:08:01.390 --> 02:08:06.090]
yes but I expired that like days ago in person reason it's still playing what do you what do you mean by

[02:08:06.090 --> 02:08:10.670]
that like an ando you can hit instant expire and that means it would stop playing and I did that days

[02:08:10.670 --> 02:08:13.650]
ago and for some reason it came back and it still plans I have to call them and see what's up

[02:08:13.650 --> 02:08:20.710]
wow it's like Christine yeah you can't destroy it nope you know it's a very end of Christine when

[02:08:20.710 --> 02:08:28.470]
the car is like just a pile of junk you know like a big square junk heap and they show the close-up

[02:08:29.550 --> 02:08:37.590]
then you see just a couple of pieces of metal starting to move do you remember that oh yeah

[02:08:39.250 --> 02:08:44.110]
Kevin says greetings well in spread of the following your signal sucks sucks your station sucks

[02:08:44.110 --> 02:08:48.550]
and management sucks you're still one of the only exceptions in the suck world that is radio down here

[02:08:49.690 --> 02:08:55.730]
one of the stations needs to grow some balls down here and have you guys do something

[02:08:56.910 --> 02:09:00.730]
give George his own show in the early afternoon then Le Bastard in the late afternoon then

[02:09:00.730 --> 02:09:07.930]
they will fear you I noticed Le Bastard had a two three in Madaga two two two two do you think

[02:09:07.930 --> 02:09:15.270]
Jim would look at the two two now then Kevin says please voice unfortunately is un un

[02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:20.230]
listenable maybe more tolerable than Kelly's at best love you Neil I think that's nonsense

[02:09:20.230 --> 02:09:22.150]
they're just looking to pick on your ass

[02:09:28.430 --> 02:09:33.350]
being initial return on a few of these investments not compelling definitely not compelling

[02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:37.530]
Bruce from Pembert Prime says I listen almost every day online for my office it's rare for me to

[02:09:37.530 --> 02:09:41.570]
tune into any other AMR FM station in this market I might catch some of the Joe Rochow in the

[02:09:41.570 --> 02:09:45.490]
morning leading up to your show maybe I'll carry over for about 20 minutes when you're done the

[02:09:45.490 --> 02:09:49.910]
rest of my radio time is on XM or downloaded music says Bruce and Pembert Pines thanks Bruce

[02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:54.250]
you're the one what do we got about 10 listeners left according to this a new research yeah

[02:09:54.250 --> 02:09:58.750]
I would hope you knock on the research now it's boring nobody wants to hear about okay we're done

[02:10:02.910 --> 02:10:07.750]
this is Jason who was threatening moments ago that he was tuning out remember Jason

[02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:14.990]
chronic Jason yep Chester copper plots the Zaxx face we did look like a model now like Joseph oh

[02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:18.050]
yeah crack up when I hear that our Joe and Zach lover is possible

[02:10:20.210 --> 02:10:27.670]
please is Joe Bell have the seat up in the morning oh that's good no it's really annoying

[02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:36.250]
yeah is it the Kenny Rogers says hey broke back I tried and tried not to listen after George

[02:10:36.250 --> 02:10:42.970]
was like go ahead and tune in for weeks I was listening to Colin Crock cow pile over on ESPN and he

[02:10:42.970 --> 02:10:47.310]
just plain retarded so I'm back and I wanted to say no matter how hard I tried I can't quit

[02:10:47.310 --> 02:10:53.790]
Neil Rogers glad you're still here says the Kenny Rogers percy in Miami lakes as I definitely

[02:10:53.790 --> 02:10:58.270]
think Joe Bell is intentionally sabotaging your show the signal was fine this morning during Joe

[02:10:58.270 --> 02:11:03.630]
show now it's back to the ocean sound and getting worse I don't know how you muster up the energy

[02:11:03.630 --> 02:11:08.430]
to do the show every day but don't let the Joyce will get to you like Don Althabello said treachery is

[02:11:08.430 --> 02:11:20.030]
everywhere remember Don Althabello that was the anxious Eli Wallach oh my god there are people on

[02:11:20.030 --> 02:11:24.970]
death row for lesser offenses than his acting performance and I was that phrase very loosely in God

[02:11:24.970 --> 02:11:32.390]
Father 3 I thought we could reason together oh brother you now did you say you saw God Father 3

[02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:39.090]
oh yeah long time ago and you didn't like it wasn't my favorite 3 that's for sure I didn't

[02:11:39.090 --> 02:11:44.710]
I didn't ask that it wasn't the favorite of anybody although that pull we did the other day boy a

[02:11:44.710 --> 02:11:49.730]
whole bunch of people I never give the result of that did I and just as well and just as well

[02:11:49.730 --> 02:11:55.690]
because reading the pull results is evidently not very compelling Danes says I think I know what

[02:11:55.690 --> 02:12:01.090]
the noise is when you guys stop talking the buzzing volume slowly increases once you start talking

[02:12:01.090 --> 02:12:06.930]
the noise volume stop when we start stops I think it's a might compressor or sound compressor

[02:12:06.930 --> 02:12:11.510]
of some sort on your board I'm listening over the net and sounds fine since day thanks Dan

[02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:20.530]
wow aha Calato you know we need people out there in the audience help us with engineering because

[02:12:20.530 --> 02:12:27.470]
we got multi-problem many problems Cal says as far as the hissing on the stream it's gotten

[02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:30.710]
worse lately perhaps it has to do with the change in the connection from Toronto to the new

[02:12:30.710 --> 02:12:36.770]
studio and whatever method they used to avoid having put in a new ISD in line the hissing is

[02:12:36.770 --> 02:12:41.910]
further emphasized by the automated gain writing and compression hardware they use whenever you pause

[02:12:45.630 --> 02:12:50.130]
the automated processing starts to boost the gain and the hiss slowly increases until next time

[02:12:50.130 --> 02:12:54.050]
you speak this is pretty much standard over the air practice there shouldn't be applied to the

[02:12:54.050 --> 02:12:58.830]
online stream I seem to remember you complaining about the dumping out working on the stream and

[02:12:58.830 --> 02:13:02.230]
if they change a connection point for the stream in the studio to enable dumping on the stream

[02:13:02.230 --> 02:13:06.770]
then it's probably related to the increased hiss on the stream now they haven't done that no they

[02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:11.770]
would need to move the internet connection point to before they all my god this is too technical for

[02:13:11.770 --> 02:13:22.070]
me and too boring and definitely not compelling this is this is fairly interesting about trans fat

[02:13:24.050 --> 02:13:28.150]
probably interesting to you with your damn veggie stuff I don't know how anybody can do that how did I just

[02:13:28.750 --> 02:13:35.090]
how can you do that like when I go to Germany I love the bratwurst man oh brother do you like

[02:13:35.090 --> 02:13:39.830]
bratwurst yeah you still yeah no you still before we decided to give up all the good stuff for

[02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:47.030]
that swirly reading yeah seaweed I do like seaweed salad do you really yeah algae I don't know

[02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:50.630]
you probably go to the bottom of the fish tank and yeah and push the catfish out of the way and

[02:13:50.630 --> 02:13:56.610]
scrape up the algae and eat that for lunch what I'm really hungry yeah algae man how about the

[02:13:56.610 --> 02:14:01.210]
barnacles at the bottom of the ship I think barnacles are living I think I think we are down there

[02:14:01.210 --> 02:14:15.470]
we're at the bottom of the ship we're just about ready to hit the ocean floor water is

[02:14:21.790 --> 02:14:22.950]
yeah

[02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:31.730]
and took a hit in woody act like teaching charm and get the munchies and make brownies filled with

[02:14:31.730 --> 02:14:45.190]
hats and woody sharing with Jesus and the saints those pies on his and yeah yeah hot in his

[02:14:45.190 --> 02:14:59.070]
grace and yeah yeah hot is good yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah what if God's no cannabis

[02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:04.710]
looking for my one of us

[02:15:06.490 --> 02:15:18.190]
getting high on the back of the bus just in the nose is getting storm on a grey hunt bus too

[02:15:18.190 --> 02:15:29.310]
wrong to get some bad at you no wrong a couple of time back to take home

[02:15:29.310 --> 02:15:35.390]
or

[02:15:46.810 --> 02:15:50.730]
Hello, I'm from the

[02:15:50.730 --> 02:15:52.430]
bad, you know, bro.

[02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:54.450]
Open me here, the waves again.

[02:16:02.170 --> 02:16:04.370]
You got to admit that's pretty, pretty compelling.

[02:16:05.730 --> 02:16:07.810]
I've never heard anything like that in my life.

[02:16:08.070 --> 02:16:08.770]
QAAM, hello.

[02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:11.310]
Hello.

[02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:12.210]
Yes, sir.

[02:16:12.970 --> 02:16:13.950]
Like the fucking meal.

[02:16:14.170 --> 02:16:14.610]
Speaking.

[02:16:15.770 --> 02:16:16.570]
Hello, meal.

[02:16:17.110 --> 02:16:17.590]
Hello.

[02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:18.750]
Hello.

[02:16:19.090 --> 02:16:19.230]
Yes.

[02:16:19.770 --> 02:16:20.190]
Okay.

[02:16:20.690 --> 02:16:21.670]
I used to live here.

[02:16:21.770 --> 02:16:26.130]
I moved to the Carolina looking for, I don't know what, then I sure found it.

[02:16:26.570 --> 02:16:27.050]
Yeah.

[02:16:28.110 --> 02:16:29.470]
You found, I don't know what.

[02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:32.850]
Yeah, it's a totally different place.

[02:16:33.370 --> 02:16:37.050]
I don't miss all the traffic and all of that.

[02:16:37.410 --> 02:16:40.650]
I do miss you in some of the modern aspects of life.

[02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:46.190]
As far as the guy that emailed you in the morning, he had consulting.

[02:16:47.090 --> 02:16:49.730]
You said you were old, rich and arrogant.

[02:16:50.810 --> 02:16:52.570]
Oh, I don't know what I did with that one.

[02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:55.850]
If you write a book about how to be that way, I'll buy the first copy.

[02:16:56.530 --> 02:16:56.890]
Okay.

[02:16:57.450 --> 02:16:58.730]
How to go and face problems.

[02:17:00.090 --> 02:17:01.730]
That was, what was the name again?

[02:17:02.110 --> 02:17:02.730]
John Manelli.

[02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:03.890]
Yes, I'm right.

[02:17:04.470 --> 02:17:07.370]
Got a stern guy, a candidate that you watched at the New York Post.

[02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:08.870]
I don't know what I did with it.

[02:17:09.210 --> 02:17:10.670]
But I did send a copy to your buddy.

[02:17:10.730 --> 02:17:13.090]
He wanted me to copy my, he said he never saw it.

[02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.490]
Here it is.

[02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:16.130]
You're too old, rich and arrogant to care.

[02:17:16.370 --> 02:17:19.130]
But it might matter to the young guys and your show will be unemployed soon.

[02:17:19.570 --> 02:17:20.450]
Yeah, that point five.

[02:17:20.630 --> 02:17:22.230]
That's the final nail in the coffin, man.

[02:17:22.810 --> 02:17:24.310]
Write through my heart like a dagger.

[02:17:24.410 --> 02:17:25.630]
I'm dying on the head.

[02:17:27.630 --> 02:17:30.250]
Oozzi said, you know, I don't know why people keep doing this.

[02:17:31.810 --> 02:17:33.590]
Check out my photos on Facebook.

[02:17:33.710 --> 02:17:35.030]
No, I will not check out your photos.

[02:17:35.250 --> 02:17:38.370]
And I'm not, it says, I set up a Facebook profile on the New York Post.

[02:17:38.490 --> 02:17:39.510]
My picture is videos and events.

[02:17:39.610 --> 02:17:41.730]
And I want to add you as a friend so you can see it.

[02:17:41.730 --> 02:17:43.310]
First you need to join Facebook.

[02:17:43.730 --> 02:17:45.410]
Once you join, you can also create your own profile.

[02:17:45.810 --> 02:17:46.370]
Thanks, Oozzi.

[02:17:46.570 --> 02:17:46.950]
No thanks.

[02:17:47.170 --> 02:17:47.990]
Thanks, but no thanks.

[02:17:48.510 --> 02:17:49.890]
I don't want any part of it.

[02:17:50.370 --> 02:17:51.390]
Get flee involved.

[02:17:51.610 --> 02:17:52.750]
Okay, flee is big on that crap.

[02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:53.350]
Are you sure?

[02:17:53.550 --> 02:17:53.790]
Facebook?

[02:17:54.530 --> 02:17:55.250]
Yeah, positive.

[02:17:56.650 --> 02:17:57.930]
Here's one from Ron Brewer.

[02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:01.730]
Now is this from the real Ron Brewer?

[02:18:01.870 --> 02:18:03.130]
Is this your friend over there at Cheap Channel?

[02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:04.450]
I doubt it's the real Ron Brewer.

[02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:05.330]
How do you know?

[02:18:05.590 --> 02:18:06.110]
I just doubt it.

[02:18:06.350 --> 02:18:06.690]
I know Ron.

[02:18:08.210 --> 02:18:08.970]
You know Ron?

[02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:09.790]
Yeah, I can't see you.

[02:18:09.790 --> 02:18:11.710]
I'm sure you know a lot of people over there at Cheap Channel.

[02:18:11.810 --> 02:18:12.930]
Are you sure you aren't on their payroll?

[02:18:13.210 --> 02:18:13.750]
I wish I was.

[02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:14.790]
I could use the extra cash.

[02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:16.290]
No, but I used to work with Ron at Zeta.

[02:18:16.770 --> 02:18:17.270]
You did?

[02:18:17.490 --> 02:18:17.630]
Yeah.

[02:18:18.270 --> 02:18:19.010]
Oh, on Zeta.

[02:18:19.210 --> 02:18:21.950]
It says, could you read the morning numbers again?

[02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.750]
I didn't write it down.

[02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:24.110]
No, I'm already celebrating.

[02:18:24.170 --> 02:18:27.050]
I have a bottle of jilt-beast in and every time you read the numbers, I take a shot.

[02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:32.350]
It says, listen, we know these are not your real numbers.

[02:18:32.370 --> 02:18:34.150]
It's just a joisy panel for you.

[02:18:34.430 --> 02:18:35.610]
We like you and respect you.

[02:18:35.610 --> 02:18:41.670]
Flea can confirm this based on his conversations with Steve, but that Bubba, we hate that Schmidt

[02:18:41.670 --> 02:18:42.790]
talking redneck.

[02:18:43.450 --> 02:18:45.770]
And as you can see, we're kicking his ass right out of town.

[02:18:46.370 --> 02:18:49.190]
Bubba, we know you listen to Neil and you know you're out of here soon.

[02:18:49.670 --> 02:18:50.830]
I wonder if he means Bubba or me.

[02:18:51.610 --> 02:18:53.310]
I'm sure I got the first page of the ballpark tomorrow.

[02:18:53.450 --> 02:18:54.390]
I got to go get my arm right.

[02:18:54.590 --> 02:18:55.190]
There's Ron.

[02:18:56.090 --> 02:18:57.090]
What are you laughing about?

[02:18:57.310 --> 02:18:58.650]
I just can't see him throwing that first page.

[02:18:58.650 --> 02:18:59.690]
It's going to be an adirt for sure.

[02:19:01.310 --> 02:19:04.890]
Well, it says Flea can confirm that based on his conversations with Steve.

[02:19:05.930 --> 02:19:09.990]
That Paul and Ron are big fans of this show and they respect me and they know the numbers aren't right.

[02:19:10.110 --> 02:19:11.690]
They ought to get a hold of Jolly Joe, okay?

[02:19:14.890 --> 02:19:18.170]
And stick a long, hot cube with the Mundo and Shine.

[02:19:19.950 --> 02:19:20.770]
He's just loving it.

[02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:21.870]
He is just loving it.

[02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:23.010]
You know that, that point five.

[02:19:23.370 --> 02:19:24.530]
Oh, no, I want us to win.

[02:19:24.710 --> 02:19:25.030]
No, you don't.

[02:19:25.090 --> 02:19:25.410]
You want me?

[02:19:25.550 --> 02:19:27.010]
It's not important that the station wins.

[02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:28.270]
It's just important that I fail.

[02:19:30.190 --> 02:19:31.930]
Laney says, I listen to the show almost every day.

[02:19:31.930 --> 02:19:33.710]
It sounds just fine to me from California.

[02:19:33.710 --> 02:19:34.670]
Palo Alto.

[02:19:34.830 --> 02:19:35.930]
No ocean noises here.

[02:19:36.690 --> 02:19:37.090]
Hey.

[02:19:37.530 --> 02:19:38.990]
Well, that's because he listens online.

[02:19:39.310 --> 02:19:40.770]
The no ocean noises are not online.

[02:19:41.410 --> 02:19:42.710]
Are we right about that?

[02:19:43.050 --> 02:19:43.510]
I think so.

[02:19:43.590 --> 02:19:43.670]
Yes.

[02:19:43.890 --> 02:19:44.330]
Am I right?

[02:19:44.530 --> 02:19:44.870]
I think so.

[02:19:47.370 --> 02:19:49.470]
Michael says, I just, oh, I shouldn't have done that.

[02:19:49.570 --> 02:19:52.130]
I just see because I got this mic in a different spot.

[02:19:53.970 --> 02:19:55.910]
But anyway, this is better, right?

[02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.310]
Yeah.

[02:19:57.990 --> 02:19:59.570]
Not as much buzzing, kissing.

[02:20:00.010 --> 02:20:00.130]
Right.

[02:20:00.130 --> 02:20:04.090]
But Michael says, I just had some compelling general

[02:20:04.090 --> 02:20:04.770]
So chicken.

[02:20:05.710 --> 02:20:08.950]
Anyways, if George did a show online, I'd probably pay about 30 bucks a month for that.

[02:20:09.170 --> 02:20:11.850]
There's probably at least another 90 90s out there would also pay.

[02:20:12.030 --> 02:20:16.650]
That's 3K a month right there if he just got 100 listeners, which is before advertisers in spots.

[02:20:17.470 --> 02:20:19.350]
I'm sure it won't happen, but I'd enjoy that if he did.

[02:20:20.010 --> 02:20:22.070]
I hope it gets on to your soonies, a talented guy.

[02:20:22.350 --> 02:20:23.190]
And you're not too bad yourself.

[02:20:23.350 --> 02:20:24.850]
Actually, you are compelling, says Michael.

[02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:26.330]
Well, thanks, Mike.

[02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:27.330]
You're compelling.

[02:20:28.610 --> 02:20:29.010]
Hmm.

[02:20:31.210 --> 02:20:32.810]
Barry Jackass ends this along.

[02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:37.690]
Patriots quarterback Tom Brady needs more fine tuning before he takes the kayak out on his own, apparently.

[02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:42.350]
The Boston Herald reports that Brady flipped a rented kayak in the Charles River this weekend,

[02:20:42.350 --> 02:20:47.550]
and that a boat house attendant had to retrieve the 2007 NFL MVP and help him back into the kayak.

[02:20:48.270 --> 02:20:49.110]
Give me a helping hand.

[02:20:49.390 --> 02:20:50.850]
I'd like to give Tom Brady a helping hand.

[02:20:51.330 --> 02:20:51.470]
Woo.

[02:20:52.130 --> 02:20:54.590]
He had to be rescued at Charles River and cider told the Herald.

[02:20:54.590 --> 02:20:57.290]
The launch guy went out and got him and got him back in the kayak.

[02:20:57.310 --> 02:20:58.810]
He's been bragging about it ever since.

[02:20:59.090 --> 02:21:01.150]
He's telling everybody he rescued Tom Brady.

[02:21:02.250 --> 02:21:07.350]
The paper says Brady and wife Giselle Bunch had rented two kayaks and set out on a friendly trek around the river.

[02:21:07.930 --> 02:21:10.050]
The Herald's insider said there was no serious threat to the quarterback.

[02:21:10.510 --> 02:21:12.750]
It was more investment than real danger the insider said.

[02:21:13.090 --> 02:21:15.970]
Brady participated in the Patriots team golf outing yesterday.

[02:21:16.510 --> 02:21:16.850]
Wow.

[02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:19.230]
The team golf outing.

[02:21:19.430 --> 02:21:19.790]
Whoa.

[02:21:20.730 --> 02:21:24.310]
You talk about captivating and illuminating.

[02:21:24.770 --> 02:21:25.610]
Do you play golf?

[02:21:26.370 --> 02:21:27.030]
Not well.

[02:21:27.490 --> 02:21:29.650]
No, I'm not asking you, but you do play it.

[02:21:29.770 --> 02:21:30.290]
Yeah, everyone's a lot.

[02:21:30.470 --> 02:21:31.170]
Oh, God.

[02:21:32.350 --> 02:21:34.270]
Well, let me ask you one question.

[02:21:34.390 --> 02:21:34.630]
Okay.

[02:21:34.890 --> 02:21:35.070]
Okay.

[02:21:35.070 --> 02:21:35.430]
Why?

[02:21:36.830 --> 02:21:38.170]
I just like to go out and drink beers.

[02:21:38.750 --> 02:21:39.550]
Oh, so.

[02:21:39.870 --> 02:21:41.570]
Yeah, it's a good excuse for guys to go out and get drunk.

[02:21:41.710 --> 02:21:42.070]
That's true.

[02:21:42.370 --> 02:21:43.010]
That's my reason.

[02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:46.750]
Tyson says I have no life.

[02:21:46.750 --> 02:21:49.190]
If you know that quit sending me your stupid emails, Tyson, you're boring.

[02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:53.570]
Henry says, glad to hear you back on the year after your BS suspension.

[02:21:53.690 --> 02:21:56.690]
I'm sorry about what I have on a George screw Joe Bell.

[02:21:57.170 --> 02:21:57.890]
Please do a good job.

[02:21:57.890 --> 02:22:00.210]
I'm going to miss the spik and sud show.

[02:22:01.450 --> 02:22:03.270]
Any info on whereabouts of Rick Raleigh?

[02:22:03.350 --> 02:22:03.990]
He's in California.

[02:22:03.990 --> 02:22:04.850]
I don't know doing what.

[02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:07.130]
I love the bit used to play about.

[02:22:07.390 --> 02:22:09.610]
I found Jesus and Rick Raleigh's John.

[02:22:10.410 --> 02:22:12.010]
Keep up the good work and I'll back to sports.

[02:22:12.210 --> 02:22:13.330]
Jimmy and Danny, Danny and Jimmy.

[02:22:13.330 --> 02:22:16.450]
It says your Cape Cod, Cape Coral, speak faster.

[02:22:16.450 --> 02:22:17.170]
Listen to Henry.

[02:22:17.390 --> 02:22:17.950]
Thanks, Henry.

[02:22:18.370 --> 02:22:18.790]
Thanks, Hank.

[02:22:19.630 --> 02:22:20.490]
Cape Coral.

[02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:23.950]
Carolyn says she's in Pittsburgh.

[02:22:24.350 --> 02:22:33.230]
This streaming said downloading configuration file and then took seconds to come back and then downloading again.

[02:22:33.230 --> 02:22:33.990]
But you're back now.

[02:22:34.130 --> 02:22:35.190]
Oh, God, Carolyn.

[02:22:38.430 --> 02:22:40.630]
EEG says I drive all over South Florida.

[02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:41.890]
It sounds the worst around Miami.

[02:22:42.330 --> 02:22:44.610]
Have to shut you off from the up and down to the bottom in the static.

[02:22:44.950 --> 02:22:46.710]
Internet listeners say 85 says Sergio.

[02:22:47.050 --> 02:22:47.630]
Sorry, Sergio.

[02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:51.370]
We apologize profusely for our technical incompetence.

[02:22:51.890 --> 02:22:54.090]
And what are we going to do about those phones that aren't rolling over?

[02:22:54.670 --> 02:22:55.830]
I'll talk to him here and about it today.

[02:22:56.070 --> 02:22:59.490]
Are you going to confabulate with him about these technical and also about that signal?

[02:22:59.530 --> 02:23:01.410]
See if somebody can go out there and pee on the tower again.

[02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:01.910]
Please.

[02:23:02.650 --> 02:23:03.810]
You got it.

[02:23:14.450 --> 02:23:16.010]
Now it isn't a bathroom.

[02:23:17.090 --> 02:23:18.590]
Better keep the door shut.

[02:23:19.650 --> 02:23:21.270]
There's no other smell like it.

[02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:23.930]
No whips and so buts.

[02:23:24.990 --> 02:23:28.610]
And when he is napping, better leave him alone.

[02:23:29.650 --> 02:23:30.950]
Or at you he'll be snapping.

[02:23:31.710 --> 02:23:33.630]
Because he's dead to the bone.

[02:23:34.510 --> 02:23:35.930]
Dad to the bone.

[02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:38.670]
Dad to the bone.

[02:23:39.870 --> 02:23:40.370]
To the dead.

[02:23:42.130 --> 02:23:43.410]
To the dead.

[02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:45.830]
To the dead.

[02:23:47.250 --> 02:23:48.710]
Dad to the bone.

[02:23:49.790 --> 02:23:51.270]
And when he follows, he comes.

[02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:53.730]
He'll see his presence lame.

[02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:55.950]
He'll toss it aside.

[02:23:56.910 --> 02:23:58.650]
And ask when's the game.

[02:23:59.650 --> 02:24:01.370]
We want to tell him we love him.

[02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:03.630]
But he would just mow.

[02:24:04.410 --> 02:24:06.050]
And he'll go bug your mother.

[02:24:06.890 --> 02:24:08.730]
Because he's dead to the bone.

[02:24:09.770 --> 02:24:11.030]
Dad to the bone.

[02:24:12.290 --> 02:24:13.530]
Dad to the bone.

[02:24:14.830 --> 02:24:15.850]
To the dead.

[02:24:16.930 --> 02:24:18.370]
To the dead.

[02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:20.590]
To the dead.

[02:24:22.450 --> 02:24:22.930]
To the dead.

[02:24:23.610 --> 02:24:25.130]
132 at 560 WQ.

[02:24:25.230 --> 02:24:26.770]
And 5th is June 21.

[02:24:27.070 --> 02:24:28.090]
So it's still a little ways away.

[02:24:29.250 --> 02:24:31.090]
The good news is my father is still dead.

[02:24:31.390 --> 02:24:32.110]
That's a good thing.

[02:24:33.050 --> 02:24:36.190]
The reason I played that, Cliff and Kendall says you mentioned the last scene in Christine,

[02:24:36.190 --> 02:24:39.430]
where the radio comes on inside the crushed block of Carmetal.

[02:24:40.210 --> 02:24:42.590]
That radio signal sounds better than your signal today.

[02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:44.650]
What was the song that was playing in that scene?

[02:24:45.310 --> 02:24:46.310]
Bad to the bone.

[02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:47.770]
Remember that?

[02:24:47.970 --> 02:24:48.830]
Yeah, George Therogad.

[02:24:49.370 --> 02:24:53.730]
Dad, that, that, that, that, that's the song that's playing right at the SN.

[02:24:55.050 --> 02:24:59.090]
And the camera zooms in on that crushed metal that used to be Christine.

[02:25:00.310 --> 02:25:01.290]
And you hear the music.

[02:25:01.450 --> 02:25:04.350]
And then all of a sudden you see that one little piece of metal started moving.

[02:25:04.970 --> 02:25:09.630]
And you know, Christine used to like reform herself.

[02:25:10.030 --> 02:25:10.330]
Right.

[02:25:10.850 --> 02:25:14.870]
Well, we need, we need to go to reform school all of a, maybe we can go to Ding Dong school first though.

[02:25:15.690 --> 02:25:17.050]
I bet you're looking forward to that.

[02:25:17.050 --> 02:25:17.850]
Oh, yeah.

[02:25:18.210 --> 02:25:22.590]
Now you on Monday, Wednesday and Friday are you and the court is going to also have to go to Ding Dong school?

[02:25:22.890 --> 02:25:25.190]
I haven't been told that, but probably you think?

[02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.970]
I don't know.

[02:25:26.330 --> 02:25:28.290]
Oh my god, five Ding Dongs a week.

[02:25:28.490 --> 02:25:29.130]
That's way too many.

[02:25:29.970 --> 02:25:33.470]
Even, even I don't think I can handle it my old age, five Ding Dongs a week.

[02:25:35.890 --> 02:25:38.390]
Here's one that says Neil, I'm only about a mile from the station.

[02:25:38.450 --> 02:25:43.210]
Not only do you sound like you're underwater, but also it sounds like there's a dozen dolphins doing something that's chopped off.

[02:25:43.230 --> 02:25:43.670]
I don't know.

[02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:47.790]
Just chopped off at the end, middle of a sentence Q a M hello.

[02:25:49.450 --> 02:25:51.010]
Q a M hello.

[02:25:51.870 --> 02:25:52.230]
Wow.

[02:25:52.730 --> 02:25:53.750]
W Q a M hello.

[02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:55.790]
Hey, Neil, thank you for your condolences.

[02:25:56.030 --> 02:25:57.030]
I appreciate it.

[02:25:57.030 --> 02:25:57.890]
Yeah, very sorry, Mike.

[02:25:58.130 --> 02:25:58.410]
You know what?

[02:25:58.510 --> 02:26:00.550]
I think it's, I think it's with the I bok.

[02:26:01.130 --> 02:26:08.810]
That's what I think it is because when the I bok was in working, there was, there wasn't any kind of interference whatsoever.

[02:26:11.010 --> 02:26:12.430]
When the what wasn't working?

[02:26:12.730 --> 02:26:13.050]
I bok.

[02:26:13.230 --> 02:26:19.490]
You have what they call I bok, which is, oh boy, I'm not really too sure what I should know.

[02:26:20.090 --> 02:26:21.870]
It's a new way of transmission.

[02:26:22.370 --> 02:26:26.270]
Like when you turn it on a different frequency, you're here a big hissing sound.

[02:26:26.590 --> 02:26:26.890]
Really?

[02:26:27.250 --> 02:26:27.410]
Yeah.

[02:26:29.610 --> 02:26:32.390]
It's kind of like HD radio or something.

[02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:34.410]
Oh, well, we are HD radio.

[02:26:34.490 --> 02:26:34.710]
Yeah.

[02:26:34.710 --> 02:26:40.910]
But when the I bok is off, if this is HD radio, I'd hate to hear what ain't.

[02:26:41.010 --> 02:26:41.110]
Yeah.

[02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:44.470]
When the I bok is off, you didn't hear any kind of interference whatsoever.

[02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:46.310]
Maybe we switch to LD.

[02:26:46.770 --> 02:26:47.230]
Look out now.

[02:26:47.850 --> 02:26:48.570]
Okay, my my.

[02:26:48.770 --> 02:26:49.370]
Hey, my, yeah.

[02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:50.030]
Have a good day.

[02:26:50.410 --> 02:26:50.670]
Bye, my.

[02:26:51.090 --> 02:26:51.090]

[02:26:51.630 --> 02:26:52.950]
Yeah, here's the thing I dog died.

[02:26:53.050 --> 02:26:54.010]
Remember I mentioned that last week?

[02:26:54.330 --> 02:26:54.550]
Yeah.

[02:26:54.930 --> 02:26:55.770]
For a sad story.

[02:26:56.110 --> 02:26:58.210]
The day that they were retiring him, the dog died.

[02:26:58.470 --> 02:26:58.590]
Hmm.

[02:26:59.410 --> 02:26:59.930]
That night.

[02:27:02.590 --> 02:27:03.490]
WQ a M hello.

[02:27:03.490 --> 02:27:07.250]
But when the I bok is off, if this is HD radio, I'm not sure.

[02:27:07.250 --> 02:27:08.070]
You were in the radio.

[02:27:08.470 --> 02:27:08.550]
I'm not sure.

[02:27:08.550 --> 02:27:08.550]

[02:27:08.610 --> 02:27:08.890]
You were in the radio.

[02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:09.210]
You were in the radio.

[02:27:09.410 --> 02:27:09.510]
Yeah.

[02:27:09.510 --> 02:27:11.030]
I bok is off.

[02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:12.730]
You didn't hear any kind of interference whatsoever.

[02:27:12.930 --> 02:27:15.410]
Mr. Acro-Bill can't stranger on the shore.

[02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.990]
Here we go.

[02:27:16.170 --> 02:27:16.810]
Okay, my my.

[02:27:17.150 --> 02:27:17.710]
Hey, my, yeah.

[02:27:17.850 --> 02:27:18.350]
Have a good day.

[02:27:18.790 --> 02:27:19.030]
Bye, my.

[02:27:19.310 --> 02:27:19.430]
Okay.

[02:27:20.050 --> 02:27:21.310]
Yeah, here's the thing I dog died.

[02:27:21.410 --> 02:27:22.350]
Remember I mentioned that last week?

[02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:22.850]
Yeah.

[02:27:23.350 --> 02:27:23.350]

[02:27:23.350 --> 02:27:24.050]
Great job, George.

[02:27:25.010 --> 02:27:25.210]
Wow.

[02:27:26.050 --> 02:27:26.410]
What?

[02:27:26.670 --> 02:27:27.190]
That's horrible.

[02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:29.370]
Now, did we ever have that before before yesterday?

[02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:30.750]
I don't remember that now.

[02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:34.810]
And you said that when you were coming in this morning on Joe show, you didn't hear that.

[02:27:34.970 --> 02:27:35.910]
It seemed okay this morning, yeah.

[02:27:36.030 --> 02:27:36.910]
It seemed okay.

[02:27:37.310 --> 02:27:38.890]
Maybe it's just a 10 to 2 thing.

[02:27:39.470 --> 02:27:41.830]
Because you know, you can't measure what people can't hear.

[02:27:42.210 --> 02:27:42.250]
Hmm.

[02:27:46.750 --> 02:27:48.970]
You won't hear that on any of the shore guarantee of that.

[02:27:49.850 --> 02:27:51.730]
What's that guy that's on across the street now?

[02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:53.330]
Colin Calhard.

[02:27:53.670 --> 02:27:54.450]
Colin Calpile.

[02:27:54.930 --> 02:27:57.650]
You won't hear that on the Colin Calpile shore guarantee of that.

[02:27:57.890 --> 02:27:58.770]
Yeah, well, mix in a little.

[02:27:59.890 --> 02:28:01.010]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.870]
WQA in.

[02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:03.170]
Hello.

[02:28:03.810 --> 02:28:04.370]
Not there.

[02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:06.250]
What a shame on that toll free number, no less.

[02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:10.010]
1-877-785-6345.

[02:28:11.550 --> 02:28:13.770]
877-785-6345.

[02:28:15.250 --> 02:28:17.610]
Starting to sound like Phil Sims on the sideline.

[02:28:18.410 --> 02:28:19.330]
Then he no jive.

[02:28:19.690 --> 02:28:21.270]
And of course, the other number for the lines that work.

[02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:27.890]
5-670-560 and pound 560 on the Verizon and AT&T wireless line.

[02:28:29.530 --> 02:28:30.850]
Phone is dead as a door now.

[02:28:33.810 --> 02:28:35.470]
Maybe that panel is right.

[02:28:36.350 --> 02:28:38.950]
Well, the online listening creep back up to around 400 and something.

[02:28:39.170 --> 02:28:40.830]
Oh, mine is like 785 now.

[02:28:40.950 --> 02:28:43.470]
Mine is like, I won't say record breaking levels,

[02:28:43.630 --> 02:28:45.990]
but by the end of the day, we're going to be over 1,000 people listening online.

[02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:47.750]
How is that possible when we got no audience?

[02:28:48.930 --> 02:28:50.430]
You might want to ask your buddy that.

[02:28:51.370 --> 02:28:51.730]
Okay.

[02:28:52.870 --> 02:28:54.010]
He'll poop-poo it.

[02:28:54.890 --> 02:28:55.990]
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

[02:28:56.110 --> 02:28:57.970]
Those are just people that are like, I don't know.

[02:28:57.970 --> 02:29:00.750]
He'll come up with some excuse, some story.

[02:29:02.490 --> 02:29:03.170]
WQAM, hello.

[02:29:04.650 --> 02:29:05.050]
Hello.

[02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:05.850]
Hello.

[02:29:06.830 --> 02:29:07.510]
WQAM, hello.

[02:29:07.930 --> 02:29:08.490]
Yeah, how are you?

[02:29:08.830 --> 02:29:09.290]
Okay, sir.

[02:29:09.850 --> 02:29:11.530]
Well, I'll be the first or maybe one of the few to say.

[02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:13.330]
I enjoyed fully actually last week.

[02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.570]
Hey, all right.

[02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.530]
I'm Friday.

[02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:19.010]
I mean, it's a little more than talking about skating and eating rectum,

[02:29:19.010 --> 02:29:20.410]
but you know, I've been started.

[02:29:22.330 --> 02:29:22.730]
Yeah.

[02:29:23.330 --> 02:29:24.750]
I mean, keeping going.

[02:29:24.910 --> 02:29:26.730]
I know people have criticized you when they started.

[02:29:26.730 --> 02:29:27.890]
I think it's the same thing.

[02:29:28.110 --> 02:29:29.570]
So I think we're in a good spot.

[02:29:30.170 --> 02:29:31.090]
We're in a good spot.

[02:29:31.270 --> 02:29:32.010]
Yeah, that's what you think.

[02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:33.070]
Okay, have a great day, pal.

[02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.970]
We're in a good spot.

[02:29:34.210 --> 02:29:35.030]
You should live so long.

[02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:41.290]
The Circo Bob says, hand a laugh while reading AOA at Lundin' at Oracle

[02:29:41.290 --> 02:29:43.750]
on which restaurant foods are the highest in trans-fat content

[02:29:43.750 --> 02:29:45.370]
and are nutritionally bad for you.

[02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:47.830]
Topse on the list was your Denny's bacon double cheeseburger,

[02:29:48.350 --> 02:29:49.990]
high in both salt and saturated fats.

[02:29:50.170 --> 02:29:50.630]
All right.

[02:29:51.150 --> 02:29:52.090]
That's why it tastes so good.

[02:29:52.610 --> 02:29:53.530]
Yeah, I don't care.

[02:29:54.110 --> 02:29:56.650]
The article quoted it was like salt with a deadly weapon.

[02:29:57.170 --> 02:29:59.070]
If it tastes good, it's probably bad for you, right?

[02:29:59.350 --> 02:30:03.350]
Also, why is it you can't say the something word,

[02:30:03.590 --> 02:30:05.410]
but you can provide a verbal picture of a system where you're mad

[02:30:05.410 --> 02:30:06.930]
on kissing needles, balls.

[02:30:08.110 --> 02:30:10.310]
What's with the Glocken Mishpoka, he says?

[02:30:11.050 --> 02:30:12.050]
The Glocken Mishpoka.

[02:30:13.290 --> 02:30:15.410]
Myron Florence is going to play that in the Lawrence Walk Show.

[02:30:15.510 --> 02:30:16.490]
The Glocken Mishpoka.

[02:30:17.230 --> 02:30:18.390]
What's a Glocken spiel?

[02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:20.470]
Not here.

[02:30:22.730 --> 02:30:24.030]
It's a musical instrument, right?

[02:30:24.290 --> 02:30:24.810]
Glocken spiel?

[02:30:24.930 --> 02:30:25.130]
Sure.

[02:30:26.110 --> 02:30:27.270]
But you don't know what it is.

[02:30:27.390 --> 02:30:28.190]
I bet you can Google it.

[02:30:28.270 --> 02:30:30.170]
I didn't add a spell it.

[02:30:33.210 --> 02:30:35.390]
GLOCK, ENSPI-EL is how I would spell it.

[02:30:37.010 --> 02:30:38.270]
All right, here we go.

[02:30:38.350 --> 02:30:40.610]
EP, Pusel Animus Pussyfooter says,

[02:30:40.730 --> 02:30:42.650]
I just wrote for my home in your downtown for a lot of day

[02:30:42.650 --> 02:30:43.550]
to my main airport.

[02:30:44.190 --> 02:30:45.950]
The signal was crystal clear all through Broward

[02:30:45.950 --> 02:30:47.410]
and the northernmost part of Dade.

[02:30:47.930 --> 02:30:50.250]
Heading south down Luzhoun Road about two to three miles before

[02:30:50.250 --> 02:30:52.410]
reaching the airport, the wave effect began.

[02:30:52.770 --> 02:30:53.830]
And by the time I got to the airport,

[02:30:53.910 --> 02:30:55.290]
it was nearly obliterating the signal.

[02:30:56.490 --> 02:30:58.050]
I'm sure the advertisers are thrilled to know

[02:30:58.050 --> 02:30:59.250]
that their ads are not being heard.

[02:30:59.670 --> 02:31:00.710]
Are you listening, Jolly Jo?

[02:31:00.830 --> 02:31:02.090]
Hope it gets better, says Peepee.

[02:31:02.410 --> 02:31:02.950]
Thanks, Peepee.

[02:31:03.250 --> 02:31:05.390]
A Glocken spiel is like a xylophone,

[02:31:05.390 --> 02:31:07.570]
but it has metal bars instead of wooden.

[02:31:08.550 --> 02:31:09.110]
I'll be damned.

[02:31:09.350 --> 02:31:09.530]
There you go.

[02:31:09.530 --> 02:31:11.550]
See, I learned something on this educational show every day.

[02:31:11.690 --> 02:31:12.290]
Yeah, that's compelling.

[02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:16.610]
Leicist is, for what it's worth since you've been talking about,

[02:31:16.690 --> 02:31:18.910]
and I haven't experienced any of the noises people are talking about.

[02:31:18.910 --> 02:31:20.810]
That's from Broward through Palm Beach.

[02:31:21.010 --> 02:31:22.070]
Oh, this is Nick from Batavia.

[02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:24.470]
How are we doing to Batavia down, Nick?

[02:31:26.450 --> 02:31:27.390]
655 votes on a poll.

[02:31:27.530 --> 02:31:29.790]
That's not too shabby considering that nobody is listening.

[02:31:31.810 --> 02:31:34.270]
Maybe I should read that email from Jolly Jo again, you know?

[02:31:36.090 --> 02:31:36.950]
That one that said,

[02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:38.290]
you suck and I hate you like poison.

[02:31:38.470 --> 02:31:39.910]
And I hope you die real soon, like that.

[02:31:41.490 --> 02:31:43.110]
And we're going to put Sid Rosenberg on.

[02:31:43.170 --> 02:31:46.470]
Is the minute that his contractor is non-competit, you know, expires?

[02:31:48.090 --> 02:31:49.730]
That's what you were spreading on Friday, right?

[02:31:50.350 --> 02:31:51.530]
Sid's going to be doing 10 to 2.

[02:31:51.710 --> 02:31:52.690]
I did not say 10 to 2.

[02:31:52.890 --> 02:31:56.050]
And you could do as closing anytime he wants because he's slacker and he wanted to day off.

[02:31:56.130 --> 02:31:57.030]
Oh, me, you!

[02:31:57.230 --> 02:31:58.070]
And off for the talking.

[02:31:58.510 --> 02:32:00.610]
When the mood strikes on St. Patrick's Day,

[02:32:00.930 --> 02:32:01.690]
will you be ready?

[02:32:02.190 --> 02:32:04.370]
You will with Viagreen.

[02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:06.910]
In spite of 12 points of Guinness,

[02:32:07.110 --> 02:32:09.050]
I'm still able to get me Irish up.

[02:32:09.330 --> 02:32:11.470]
If you know what I mean, thanks to Viagreen.

[02:32:12.730 --> 02:32:15.950]
Viagreen works perfectly with Kiss Me I'm Irish Buttons.

[02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:18.770]
Side effects include a desire to drink before 9 a.m.

[02:32:19.010 --> 02:32:22.810]
Frontically searching for a pot of gold and a strange craving for boiled food.

[02:32:23.130 --> 02:32:27.150]
If your snake is charmed for more than 4 hours, call your doctor immediately.

[02:32:27.290 --> 02:32:31.110]
And me girlfriend thought the bloody stone was as hard as a rock.

[02:32:31.330 --> 02:32:32.930]
Is not just a lazy in your pockets,

[02:32:33.230 --> 02:32:34.630]
are you just happy to see me?

[02:32:35.350 --> 02:32:36.710]
When the mood strikes,

[02:32:37.070 --> 02:32:39.790]
make sure your pipe is calling with Viagreen.

[02:32:42.590 --> 02:32:44.130]
Okay, it's 144 bar.

[02:32:44.130 --> 02:32:46.570]
I'm sure that I keep pressing the right mic button on here.

[02:32:47.790 --> 02:32:48.530]
Aren't you pleased?

[02:32:48.910 --> 02:32:49.090]
Very.

[02:32:49.630 --> 02:32:50.870]
Well, no, because I'm out of the habit.

[02:32:51.250 --> 02:32:52.330]
The first one is Mike 1.

[02:32:52.990 --> 02:32:54.510]
And the second one, Mike 2, which I never used,

[02:32:54.630 --> 02:32:56.730]
which is ordinarily sitting behind the board, you know?

[02:32:58.750 --> 02:33:00.510]
Maybe I should take pictures of the studio.

[02:33:00.710 --> 02:33:02.050]
We need to do something with that website.

[02:33:02.110 --> 02:33:02.830]
That's one thing.

[02:33:03.250 --> 02:33:04.230]
Yeah, I'm going to talk to Eric today.

[02:33:05.030 --> 02:33:05.130]
Huh?

[02:33:05.310 --> 02:33:06.270]
I'll try to talk to Eric today.

[02:33:06.490 --> 02:33:08.710]
Yeah, get some of that old crap off of there, please.

[02:33:09.090 --> 02:33:11.030]
And put your name on here as opposed to George.

[02:33:11.230 --> 02:33:12.610]
Email free, you know, not George.

[02:33:12.610 --> 02:33:13.030]
Right.

[02:33:14.230 --> 02:33:16.270]
And I'll talk to Corso about the hissing in your mic, too.

[02:33:17.490 --> 02:33:19.110]
And talk to him about...

[02:33:20.410 --> 02:33:22.210]
I mean, what do they tell you about, they just do?

[02:33:22.310 --> 02:33:23.010]
What's their explanation?

[02:33:23.870 --> 02:33:24.510]
They didn't give one.

[02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:28.230]
They aren't aware of it?

[02:33:29.010 --> 02:33:30.150]
They know our signal's bad.

[02:33:30.510 --> 02:33:30.610]
Yeah.

[02:33:31.330 --> 02:33:32.830]
No, that's not just our signal is bad.

[02:33:33.010 --> 02:33:33.610]
That's like...

[02:33:34.670 --> 02:33:36.230]
That's scandalous is what it is.

[02:33:38.150 --> 02:33:40.510]
That's something new and not too exciting, if you ask me.

[02:33:40.510 --> 02:33:42.610]
I could be wrong, but...

[02:33:42.610 --> 02:33:44.390]
Misha says, no, remember Misha?

[02:33:44.530 --> 02:33:44.790]
I do.

[02:33:45.130 --> 02:33:47.390]
Can fleece at least say just this morning sometimes?

[02:33:49.930 --> 02:33:51.130]
Can you say just this morning?

[02:33:51.290 --> 02:33:52.070]
I did just this morning.

[02:33:52.410 --> 02:33:54.270]
Oh, I really miss a little George says, Misha.

[02:33:54.650 --> 02:33:55.090]
Well, guess what?

[02:33:55.230 --> 02:33:55.930]
He's not coming back.

[02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:56.650]
We miss him, too.

[02:33:56.890 --> 02:33:57.650]
But he ain't coming back.

[02:33:58.590 --> 02:33:59.690]
Screw the numbers, Uncle Leal.

[02:33:59.770 --> 02:34:00.590]
I'm not on the day in panel.

[02:34:00.610 --> 02:34:01.470]
That's why I don't believe it.

[02:34:02.070 --> 02:34:03.250]
Who do you think is better looking?

[02:34:03.410 --> 02:34:04.750]
Tom Brady or Cristiano Ronaldo?

[02:34:05.330 --> 02:34:07.830]
If we could put Tom Brady's head on Cristiano Ronaldo's body,

[02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:09.270]
then you'd have something.

[02:34:09.270 --> 02:34:10.110]
Yeah, guys, rip.

[02:34:10.910 --> 02:34:11.110]
Yeah.

[02:34:11.830 --> 02:34:13.350]
Cristiano Ronaldo, he's got a great body.

[02:34:13.490 --> 02:34:15.650]
And Tom Brady, I don't know.

[02:34:15.870 --> 02:34:17.490]
His body's a little schmootsy if he asked me.

[02:34:17.870 --> 02:34:19.950]
I don't think Misha knows from a schmootsy, but nevertheless.

[02:34:20.290 --> 02:34:20.910]
Now, he's a little soft.

[02:34:21.810 --> 02:34:22.610]
Little soft?

[02:34:24.690 --> 02:34:26.190]
Oh, Ron Brewers is flee.

[02:34:26.270 --> 02:34:28.930]
I don't think you're aware, but that ball is not going into the dirt.

[02:34:29.570 --> 02:34:30.150]
I feel good.

[02:34:30.210 --> 02:34:31.970]
I should have no problem throwing the heat.

[02:34:32.110 --> 02:34:33.630]
I lost 70 pounds, had a black guy.

[02:34:33.690 --> 02:34:34.670]
My wife almost left me.

[02:34:35.030 --> 02:34:38.090]
My son thinks the cats were killing people.

[02:34:38.090 --> 02:34:39.910]
I can't take any more humiliation.

[02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:41.990]
That's why I'm throwing the first pitch like a man.

[02:34:42.350 --> 02:34:44.110]
Paul doesn't charge the buffet at the club level.

[02:34:44.290 --> 02:34:45.410]
I'm really worried about his weight.

[02:34:45.750 --> 02:34:45.950]
Yeah.

[02:34:46.430 --> 02:34:48.150]
Oh, he wanted to know how's the weather in Toronto.

[02:34:48.590 --> 02:34:49.290]
Yeah, I'm sure he did.

[02:34:49.970 --> 02:34:51.150]
Merky, it's a murky day.

[02:34:52.350 --> 02:34:54.990]
I'll give you the temperature momentarily from a city post-24.

[02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:57.230]
I know it's compulsive and it's concise.

[02:34:59.470 --> 02:35:00.230]
It's compelling.

[02:35:00.530 --> 02:35:01.250]
That's a compulsive.

[02:35:01.450 --> 02:35:01.910]
Yeah, like that.

[02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.990]
16.

[02:35:02.250 --> 02:35:03.390]
I don't know what's that.

[02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.750]
61.

[02:35:04.570 --> 02:35:05.970]
But it's going all the way up to 21.

[02:35:06.130 --> 02:35:07.230]
It's going up to 70 today.

[02:35:07.230 --> 02:35:09.470]
And 66 tomorrow and 68 on Thursday.

[02:35:09.770 --> 02:35:11.910]
And 72 on Friday and 72 on Saturday.

[02:35:12.210 --> 02:35:12.530]
Nice.

[02:35:12.670 --> 02:35:13.890]
Monday, Tuesday, Saturday.

[02:35:16.330 --> 02:35:18.550]
So that's find out from your friend Steve,

[02:35:18.670 --> 02:35:20.050]
if it's the real Ron Bource, sending those,

[02:35:20.130 --> 02:35:21.490]
which I'm sure it's not, but okay.

[02:35:22.290 --> 02:35:23.330]
You never know.

[02:35:26.810 --> 02:35:29.730]
Munich's Merriant Plots is one of the city's central squares.

[02:35:30.250 --> 02:35:32.810]
The Merriant Plots is named for the Merriant Sowl,

[02:35:32.810 --> 02:35:34.870]
a column crowned with a statue of the Virgin Mary.

[02:35:36.130 --> 02:35:37.570]
Why do I care about that?

[02:35:38.010 --> 02:35:38.410]
Not sure.

[02:35:39.350 --> 02:35:40.550]
I've got a picture of it.

[02:35:41.550 --> 02:35:43.470]
All the cities of any size in Europe,

[02:35:43.470 --> 02:35:45.010]
they've got a big church.

[02:35:45.690 --> 02:35:47.130]
In Cologne, they've got a big church,

[02:35:47.210 --> 02:35:48.630]
and in Rome, they've got the, you know,

[02:35:48.970 --> 02:35:49.670]
you said the Vatican.

[02:35:50.110 --> 02:35:50.730]
Have you ever been to Prague?

[02:35:51.470 --> 02:35:51.610]
No.

[02:35:51.890 --> 02:35:52.430]
I've heard it's great.

[02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:54.450]
Yeah, I hear it's pretty interesting.

[02:35:56.730 --> 02:35:58.430]
But I'm through with those European trips.

[02:35:58.570 --> 02:35:59.150]
I'm too old.

[02:35:59.930 --> 02:36:01.130]
And of course, once I'm out of work,

[02:36:01.190 --> 02:36:02.370]
I won't be able to afford it anyway.

[02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:04.170]
Deputy QAM, hello.

[02:36:05.050 --> 02:36:05.810]
Hello, Neal.

[02:36:06.030 --> 02:36:06.570]
Yes, sir.

[02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:09.250]
Neal, God, man, I can't believe it.

[02:36:09.650 --> 02:36:10.430]
Couple of things.

[02:36:10.650 --> 02:36:10.990]
Couple of things.

[02:36:11.310 --> 02:36:11.830]
Number one.

[02:36:12.410 --> 02:36:12.650]
Yeah.

[02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:13.870]
We love George.

[02:36:13.870 --> 02:36:14.570]
We miss George.

[02:36:14.930 --> 02:36:15.530]
But he's okay.

[02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:18.370]
Number two, Parlin, Old Ron.

[02:36:18.750 --> 02:36:19.990]
They're just listening to, you know,

[02:36:20.090 --> 02:36:20.490]
take notes.

[02:36:21.210 --> 02:36:22.810]
Number three, people out there.

[02:36:22.970 --> 02:36:24.850]
You don't realize what you have in your Rogers.

[02:36:25.590 --> 02:36:26.630]
Take advantage of them.

[02:36:26.750 --> 02:36:27.710]
Don't screw with them.

[02:36:28.070 --> 02:36:28.530]
A management.

[02:36:28.690 --> 02:36:29.130]
Everybody.

[02:36:29.630 --> 02:36:30.830]
You know, keep pulling.

[02:36:31.850 --> 02:36:33.870]
And the show too, man, we love you, Neal.

[02:36:33.970 --> 02:36:35.050]
Don't never go away, man.

[02:36:35.550 --> 02:36:35.830]
Okay.

[02:36:37.550 --> 02:36:37.870]
Wow.

[02:36:40.370 --> 02:36:41.790]
Heavy duty suction, wouldn't you say?

[02:36:42.170 --> 02:36:43.870]
Yeah, maybe tomorrow on Paul and Ron during the show.

[02:36:44.010 --> 02:36:44.130]
You'll hear.

[02:36:45.430 --> 02:36:47.890]
Oh, we have to hear that in stereo, man, on FM.

[02:36:48.690 --> 02:36:49.530]
Wouldn't that be a great sound?

[02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.910]
Yeah.

[02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:52.210]
Maybe we'll hear that out of one channel

[02:36:52.210 --> 02:36:54.470]
in the sounds of the roaring waves out of the other one.

[02:36:56.910 --> 02:36:58.990]
I have just never heard anything like that in my life.

[02:36:58.990 --> 02:37:01.190]
And I guess they're like oblivious, huh?

[02:37:02.190 --> 02:37:03.310]
From what you're telling me.

[02:37:03.530 --> 02:37:04.670]
Yeah, I'm compiling a list.

[02:37:05.050 --> 02:37:05.970]
A list of what?

[02:37:06.470 --> 02:37:07.370]
Things that complain about.

[02:37:10.050 --> 02:37:11.350]
Oh, and they're going to say,

[02:37:11.350 --> 02:37:13.210]
C's been on the Rogers show for two weeks now,

[02:37:13.270 --> 02:37:14.810]
ready, he's turning into a little Neal.

[02:37:14.910 --> 02:37:16.450]
He's bitching and moaning, whining.

[02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:19.530]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:37:20.670 --> 02:37:23.910]
No one has taken the time to explain to you why this effect is going on.

[02:37:24.250 --> 02:37:24.490]
Okay.

[02:37:25.010 --> 02:37:25.770]
Go right ahead.

[02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:30.510]
What it is, is it's a Cuban station that's just running an open carrier,

[02:37:30.690 --> 02:37:33.530]
just the station's on, they're not modulating it.

[02:37:33.610 --> 02:37:37.390]
And its frequency is about two or three cycles off of five sixties.

[02:37:37.990 --> 02:37:41.190]
And so every time it hits it, on, it raises it,

[02:37:41.310 --> 02:37:42.930]
when it's a one cycle off, it lowers it.

[02:37:43.030 --> 02:37:44.110]
So you get the trombing,

[02:37:44.670 --> 02:37:46.390]
open wave effect that you describe it.

[02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:48.230]
And it's really annoying, isn't it?

[02:37:48.650 --> 02:37:49.410]
Yes, it is.

[02:37:50.350 --> 02:37:51.150]
So that's what it is.

[02:37:51.330 --> 02:37:52.030]
That's what it is.

[02:37:52.170 --> 02:37:54.970]
It's just the beating of the two states against each other

[02:37:54.970 --> 02:37:56.310]
and they're out from each other,

[02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:57.910]
as far as being exactly,

[02:37:58.170 --> 02:38:00.090]
I'm frequency about the amount of the beating you hear.

[02:38:00.970 --> 02:38:01.370]
That's it.

[02:38:01.970 --> 02:38:02.510]
I'll be damned.

[02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:03.790]
Okay, thanks for the extra welcome.

[02:38:03.790 --> 02:38:04.270]
You were welcome.

[02:38:04.650 --> 02:38:05.130]
Glad to have you.

[02:38:05.210 --> 02:38:05.510]
You see it.

[02:38:05.850 --> 02:38:06.290]
I do like that.

[02:38:06.390 --> 02:38:08.390]
There's like a technical guy who knows what he's talking about.

[02:38:08.570 --> 02:38:10.010]
It seems like we've had a few tech guys calling.

[02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:11.090]
Yeah.

[02:38:11.470 --> 02:38:14.070]
For every dumbass we have, there's one tech guy out there who knows what he's talking about.

[02:38:14.210 --> 02:38:15.510]
Maybe we can put him to work on engineering.

[02:38:15.950 --> 02:38:16.250]
Maybe.

[02:38:16.610 --> 02:38:17.530]
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

[02:38:17.670 --> 02:38:20.010]
It's a lot of use into critiquet that it is to fix it.

[02:38:20.170 --> 02:38:20.590]
Yeah, I know.

[02:38:22.010 --> 02:38:22.750]
That's what I heard.

[02:38:24.410 --> 02:38:25.650]
Paulie and Titusville says,

[02:38:25.710 --> 02:38:29.710]
I'm not sure how they over the air single sounds, but the streaming audio is suffering from a compressor

[02:38:29.710 --> 02:38:31.390]
that's not functioning or set up properly.

[02:38:31.810 --> 02:38:35.690]
As soon as you pause, the hiss comes up right away until it sounds like Niagara Falls.

[02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:39.770]
I could buy a compressor with a guitarist or 50 bucks that's cleaner sounding.

[02:38:42.730 --> 02:38:43.650]
What is that?

[02:38:46.210 --> 02:38:47.450]
So that's on your end?

[02:38:47.850 --> 02:38:48.410]
I would guess so.

[02:38:48.530 --> 02:38:49.070]
Yeah, it sounds like.

[02:38:49.230 --> 02:38:49.230]

[02:38:51.470 --> 02:38:55.730]
It would sure be nice now that we have that studio and it doesn't need to be on the other 20 hours a day.

[02:38:56.330 --> 02:38:59.650]
Since we're going to be doing ding dong school and all these other things taking up a lot of time.

[02:38:59.870 --> 02:39:05.670]
If we take just a few minutes off the air and go through and see if we can't iron out some of these bugs, you know.

[02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:09.430]
Do I think that's a swell idea?

[02:39:12.010 --> 02:39:12.370]
Yes.

[02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:13.170]
No, I did.

[02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:17.170]
As opposed to.

[02:39:21.270 --> 02:39:22.310]
As opposed to that.

[02:39:23.370 --> 02:39:25.270]
Oh, there he goes, bitching and moaning again.

[02:39:25.410 --> 02:39:26.470]
Everybody's tired of that.

[02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:28.910]
Yeah, me too. WQAM. Hello.

[02:39:29.710 --> 02:39:31.510]
Oh, hang up a little to your answer.

[02:39:31.730 --> 02:39:32.290]
Okay, please.

[02:39:33.410 --> 02:39:34.090]
Excellent call.

[02:39:34.290 --> 02:39:37.230]
That's maybe the best call we've had in other than the engineer that was just done.

[02:39:40.490 --> 02:39:43.530]
That was great. WQAM. Hello.

[02:39:44.510 --> 02:39:45.230]
Hey, Neil.

[02:39:45.730 --> 02:39:46.110]
Yes, sir.

[02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:47.610]
On your signal.

[02:39:47.830 --> 02:39:49.910]
If you check your on the right side.

[02:39:50.110 --> 02:39:50.730]
The other Jones.

[02:39:51.090 --> 02:39:53.930]
The other Jones drink the cool aid sweetheart. Drink it.

[02:39:54.290 --> 02:39:54.950]
Go up it down.

[02:39:57.430 --> 02:39:58.170]
WQAM. Hello.

[02:40:02.510 --> 02:40:02.970]
Hello.

[02:40:03.190 --> 02:40:03.830]
Yes, sir.

[02:40:05.370 --> 02:40:07.070]
Yeah, this is your Roger show.

[02:40:07.430 --> 02:40:08.590]
Yes, it is.

[02:40:08.590 --> 02:40:09.190]
This is Neil.

[02:40:09.530 --> 02:40:10.210]
Yes, it is.

[02:40:10.690 --> 02:40:11.650]
I don't know. Okay, glistening.

[02:40:11.650 --> 02:40:11.970]
I'm sorry.

[02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:16.690]
Yeah, I listen to you all the way to Port Saint Luther yesterday.

[02:40:17.370 --> 02:40:17.890]
I'll be damned.

[02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:23.510]
And I'm on the way back from out on 27 on the way back from South Bay right now.

[02:40:23.690 --> 02:40:25.330]
And you're coming in and clear the bell.

[02:40:25.670 --> 02:40:26.430]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:30.750]
Well, you see the farther you get away from a Cuba, the less that stuff comes up.

[02:40:31.710 --> 02:40:35.730]
The engineer guy that was on two calls ago, he had his thumb on it.

[02:40:36.850 --> 02:40:38.850]
It's that damn Raoul Castor.

[02:40:38.910 --> 02:40:42.690]
He thought Fidel was bad, which he was that bearded son of a bitch, but this Raoul.

[02:40:43.410 --> 02:40:46.550]
He is really a, that's what we got to get Obama to do.

[02:40:46.670 --> 02:40:49.990]
Okay, forget about all these nukes in Pakistan and all that stuff in North Korea.

[02:40:50.410 --> 02:40:54.430]
Let's start worrying about Fidel and them transmitter down there, right?

[02:40:54.870 --> 02:40:57.310]
Yeah, my wife just text me and says she can't hear the station at all.

[02:40:57.330 --> 02:40:58.210]
I'm trying to find out where she's at.

[02:40:58.570 --> 02:40:58.910]
Wow.

[02:40:58.910 --> 02:41:02.810]
Oh, it's day.

[02:41:03.210 --> 02:41:03.410]
Oh, right.

[02:41:03.710 --> 02:41:04.670]
If I have a town.

[02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:08.810]
But you have five, six, oh, WQ.

[02:41:09.110 --> 02:41:18.250]
And once there was a sanitary who was caught indulging a habit.

[02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:19.390]
You're fair.

[02:41:19.710 --> 02:41:25.230]
We've got all not much different like a typical meocompany.

[02:41:25.230 --> 02:41:27.010]
It's all right.

[02:41:28.410 --> 02:41:31.310]
It's off to Larry.

[02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:40.570]
We all thank you for giving writers something funny to do.

[02:41:41.570 --> 02:41:45.870]
You're looking for guys who make you go high.

[02:41:46.710 --> 02:41:50.750]
Larry, crack thank you for tapping your shoe.

[02:41:52.590 --> 02:41:55.610]
New stories last a few days.

[02:41:56.330 --> 02:41:58.530]
But you refuse to go away.

[02:41:59.110 --> 02:42:02.430]
Republicans are prime, aren't we gay?

[02:42:02.430 --> 02:42:04.630]
Hey, hey, hey.

[02:42:05.110 --> 02:42:07.310]
It's all to Larry.

[02:42:08.150 --> 02:42:10.270]
We're cheek up now.

[02:42:11.430 --> 02:42:17.150]
We all invite you to a hell of a bun.

[02:42:17.570 --> 02:42:19.170]
Donnie, your con rod.

[02:42:19.970 --> 02:42:21.650]
Like doing certain jokes.

[02:42:23.490 --> 02:42:26.610]
Larry, taking no crap when he's happy, hitting you.

[02:42:28.130 --> 02:42:29.750]
Game, game, game.

[02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:31.570]
I never have been gay.

[02:42:31.870 --> 02:42:33.250]
Game, game, game.

[02:42:33.610 --> 02:42:35.090]
I never have been gay.

[02:42:35.450 --> 02:42:37.530]
It's all to Larry.

[02:42:38.350 --> 02:42:40.930]
He wants to stay gay.

[02:42:41.650 --> 02:42:46.210]
But his own party wants him to go away.

[02:42:47.350 --> 02:42:50.530]
He's loving this red hot font.

[02:42:50.850 --> 02:42:56.890]
He needs to say, Larry, crack this red his leg for you.

[02:42:56.890 --> 02:42:59.790]
He wants a man to scream.

[02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:01.070]
You're fair.

[02:43:01.230 --> 02:43:04.730]
Bye, bye, bye.
