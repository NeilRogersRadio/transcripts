[00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.180]
The music expressed on the previous programs are those of the hosts, guests and collars and do not reflect those who want your take on next season.

[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:09.980]
Jordan, you like him?

[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.320]
Oh yeah, he's my buddy.

[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.400]
He's not half.

[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.460]
We're just going to be in the same class tonight.

[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.520]
I'm going to have a U.K.A.M. Miami.

[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.920]
So many last times.

[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.880]
So little time.

[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.660]
Ask clown.

[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.040]
That can be a volume in the sitcom.

[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.880]
Right, come on.

[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.780]
Michael S'maro.

[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.440]
Well, why not?

[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.720]
Because it's today.

[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.120]
Let's start the very cute one right now.

[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.100]
Let's get the V-Style and Hurricane Warlock.

[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.980]
Dial 5670560 in date and brown.

[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.820]
Go came, man.

[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.980]
We didn't know we had another one.

[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.920]
So I'll be on five.

[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.380]
Go came and go came.

[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.620]
Or pound 568.

[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.220]
Get some Virginia Tech and they will suffer while it's falling.

[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.100]
The opinion's expressed by me.

[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.440]
Go find your own.

[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.820]
His guests or his collars.

[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.180]
We do not represent those of WQA.

[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.780]
I'm 68.540.

[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.460]
On the hill, as the O'Rodger and I think we have.

[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.620]
On 560 WQAM.

[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.400]
Just tell me what your problem is.

[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.400]
I don't mind.

[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.680]
Just when you start to join me.

[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.480]
I'll be a stupid bitch.

[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.000]
I don't mind getting it again.

[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.580]
Yeah.

[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.360]
He done it again.

[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.960]
1001 at 560 WQAM.

[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.020]
Happy Wednesday to you.

[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.360]
Possible Hurricane hotline on the schedule today.

[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.280]
But we never found out.

[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.560]
We got a hurricane hotline or not.

[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.780]
We didn't find out.

[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.240]
I didn't find out.

[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.960]
Mom, let's follow through on this stuff.

[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.500]
Terrancy.

[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.220]
Slacker.

[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.620]
He needs to be beaten with a tyrant.

[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.800]
God.

[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.900]
Possible as if.

[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.420]
I bet there's a lot of people out there in the audience on the edge of their seats.

[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.200]
Oh, we want to know when that Hurricane hotline is on.

[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.700]
Is it on?

[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.380]
Or is it all possible?

[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.200]
Well, anyway, we got the big O'Rod too.

[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.380]
He's on.

[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.580]
Something.

[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.220]
Jim Mandage 4-7.

[00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.840]
Who's getting clobbered by a labaster in the afternoon.

[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.520]
Maybe following two hours of dead air just doesn't work for the man of dogs.

[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.840]
It's often tonight, 7-8.

[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.960]
And DA shows speaking dead air for me to 11-10-9.

[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.820]
Oh, we got a lot of dead air on this station, you know what?

[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.120]
We got a lot of dead air.

[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.840]
But wait till we get that signal cranked up, baby, and somebody can hear us.

[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.000]
Right.

[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.740]
Any of it at the end.

[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.220]
No, it's going to be a while.

[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.720]
Now, what are we going?

[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.440]
8 million watts?

[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.180]
Right.

[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.760]
8 million watts days and 45 billion watts at night.

[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.340]
I understand at nighttime, you couldn't hear the station if they paid you a Zillion dollars.

[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.220]
Can you hear it?

[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.140]
And we wonder why we get shares at night.

[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.220]
Nobody can hear it.

[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.980]
Even in the building, they can't hear it.

[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.600]
I think DA ought to sue their ass.

[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.540]
Not a good idea.

[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.520]
Oh, it's a suit.

[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.080]
It's a lawsuit, Greg.

[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.960]
It's a suit.

[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.220]
Oh, my God.

[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.800]
Here's our first email today.

[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.580]
Have no fear, Jolly Jo is here.

[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.800]
To little George from the real fake Jolly Jo bell.

[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.560]
You ready to go yourself strapped in?

[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.140]
Yeah, I got the volume turned down on my change in the station.

[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.120]
This was supposed to be a secret, but I can't hold it in any longer.

[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.500]
Little George, your new O-9 Cadillac Escalade is being customized as I write this.

[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.160]
I couldn't give you just any ordinary Cadillac straight from the factory.

[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.960]
No, only the best for my little George.

[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.640]
This puppy has all the bells and whistles.

[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.220]
It's painted money green, has 30-inch gold rims, embroidered pot leaves on the seats,

[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.720]
and a sound system that will blow your eardrums out.

[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.060]
There's two phone books on the seats you can see over the wheel and a couple pounds of weed and the trunk for all time's sake.

[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.820]
Don't worry about a thing.

[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.100]
You deserve it, my friend.

[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.680]
You've been patiently waiting for this day.

[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.500]
Congratulations, little George.

[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.080]
March down to my office immediately after Neil reads this and get the keys, Cato.

[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.320]
Your boss and friend question mark, Jolly Jo bell.

[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.660]
And that's swell?

[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.500]
Yeah.

[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.700]
That's from Eddie.

[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.600]
Eddie Eddie Eddie.

[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.900]
Eddie Edmonds.

[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.820]
Not that Eddie, but some might be.

[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.020]
Some guy named Eddie who thinks he's very amusing.

[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.920]
Just like your friend John Z. Tiar, I thought he was very amusing with that fake picture of Mr. Radio.

[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.280]
Yeah.

[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.700]
Oh, but thanks for the movies.

[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.040]
Yeah, that's right. Thanks for the movies. See, it's a mixed bag.

[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.120]
Right.

[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.320]
It's a mixed bag mixed.

[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.940]
Well, you got to take the good with the bad deal.

[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.320]
That's right.

[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.200]
We'll take the free movies.

[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.760]
I mean, all the swill he sends, we can delete it.

[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.700]
Like Mr. Radio, we deleted him yesterday.

[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.700]
We're eating it.

[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.760]
Eat it or delete it.

[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.780]
Oh, here we go.

[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.940]
Here's a pull from Leonard.

[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.940]
Dr. Brown's celery.

[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.080]
Well, good for you.

[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.460]
Sounds awfully Jewish.

[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.060]
Oh, Ray.

[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.460]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.520]
Gross.

[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.980]
Yeah, once.

[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.200]
Yes, like it's like drinking celery.

[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.700]
Yeah.

[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.280]
Yeah.

[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.680]
Only a real only.

[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.480]
I've too long since comes to mind.

[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.280]
I don't know why, but.

[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.160]
Why would you drink that crap?

[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.520]
I mean, Dr. Brown's sodas are fine, but not celery.

[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.600]
Ray.

[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.460]
Well, we'll get to that pool momentarily in time.

[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.520]
We had a lot of time to kill her today, not tomorrow and hopefully not on Friday.

[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.740]
Not that we want to be slackers or like that, but we do.

[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.300]
I want to play that bit again.

[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.620]
I go mom, just when you thought you couldn't beat a big, a stupid bitch.

[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.020]
I go mom, get it again.

[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.340]
She's everywhere.

[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.740]
Her and Oprah and.

[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.640]
Chris Brown and.

[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.720]
Less brown and his man to renowned.

[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.000]
Rihanna.

[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.120]
I'll get back to you, Rihanna.

[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.980]
I'm sure.

[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.300]
The fake Tom Jicke says Steve Dollars and software.

[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.820]
He's been listening to your show and he blogs.

[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.980]
Down here in Florida, they're whining on TV about how they've only had one rainy day since Thanksgiving.

[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.760]
These people are always complaining.

[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.360]
No wonder Neal doesn't take calls.

[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.140]
Reports the fake Tom Jicke.

[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.840]
I'm your friend.

[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.780]
I'm your friend.

[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.520]
If Steve Dollars anybody else from out of the market ever heard the calls that we get in the show,

[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.340]
they'd understand immediately if not sooner.

[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.400]
Why old Neal doesn't take calls, ain't gonna take calls, and if sick and tired of calls, they suck.

[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.040]
They blow.

[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.960]
They blow.

[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.060]
They are what they are.

[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.080]
As opposed to the emails which they most of them blow to, but you can try to make something out of them.

[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.580]
You can't make something out of your airplane.

[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.260]
I'm your friend.

[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.880]
I'm gonna Joyce again in a minute.

[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.860]
Really? Well maybe we can go at the same time.

[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.660]
I'm serial.

[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.580]
And then you need to either one of us or come back in time and it'll be just dead here.

[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.740]
I'm serious.

[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.780]
I may Joyce right now.

[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.320]

[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.040]
We'll just play something long.

[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.520]
The fake Tom Jicke has got another one.

[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.240]
Really busy this morning.

[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.380]
Listening to Greg Budeau online from Q96 in Montgomery, Alabama this morning,

[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.340]
heard the Larry King no drop in the first minute.

[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.900]
I listened.

[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.400]
Which is another way of saying, oh yeah.

[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.920]
I know in my spare time I listen to Greg from Montgomery, Alabama on online.

[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.380]
Oh all the time.

[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.580]
So I can hear all our drop.

[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.820]
No.

[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.740]
I'm streaming now.

[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.520]
No.

[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.760]
I'm podcasting.

[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.240]
So thanks a lot fake Tom Jicke for nothing.

[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.460]
I'm gonna do the break a little bit early because I really am.

[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.880]
Well then.

[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.260]
I'm impressed at how the pressure pressure.

[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.780]
Maria the pressure is building.

[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.640]
Oh, no.

[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.840]
Oh god.

[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.180]
Dear Neil, please don't be alone.

[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.660]
Concer every to what you say.

[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.820]
He has a great voice.

[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.660]
And there's a good man.

[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.020]
No, don't be as a mother.

[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.800]
I'm going to do it.

[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.720]
What are you doing?

[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.260]
I'm writing fake emails.

[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.300]
Good job.

[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.960]
Don't you understand it?

[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.780]
You're sick.

[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.860]
You need help.

[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.840]
You hear that?

[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.300]
What?

[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.740]
I might not be back.

[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.760]
You need help.

[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.200]

[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.380]
What?

[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.100]
Yes, listen.

[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.040]
I'm on this right now.

[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.820]
It's the new of me.

[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:37.620]
Now.

[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.860]
And Hello, my sister, all to leave.

[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:42.700]
Me.

[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.480]
Ow.

[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.620]
He's always aching for the beat.

[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.820]
But how bad can my voice be?

[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.800]
I'm the mighty voice of the band.

[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.440]
I should have that job not you.

[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.700]
Get up so I can sit down and write Neil of fake E-men.

[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.760]
And spend some time just blowing lies out my ass.

[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:14.620]
I want to say we both sit down and write Neil of fake E-men.

[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.320]
I forgive him.

[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.600]
And maybe Neil will leave it.

[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.540]
Why, why, why, why?

[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.960]
Why, we can almost feel it swelling up down there.

[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.000]
Oh, you're so stupid.

[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.300]
I did it.

[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:28.900]
No!

[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.320]
Oh, boy, just made it back.

[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.520]
Good luck.

[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.740]
This might go on for a while.

[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.020]
I've got a wild screaming diarrhea.

[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:40.700]
All right then.

[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.860]
Where the hell did this come from?

[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.020]
I mean, besides my rectum ass.

[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.340]
No, I mean, what's this all about?

[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.580]
Everything was just fine and quiet and normal until about, I don't know, 10-0-5.

[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.900]
Must have been something you ate.

[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.720]
No, it must have been that jolly joebelly male I read.

[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.480]
Do it to you every time.

[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.340]
You do it to your joebell allergies.

[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.580]
You could sell it.

[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.400]
Oh.

[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.920]
Good thing that break seemed like about 20 minutes because I needed it.

[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.280]
Well good.

[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.100]
I was in and out of that magic room about four times.

[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.660]
Well, I stayed right here.

[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:14.840]
Did you?

[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:15.220]
Yeah.

[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.180]
Well, you must not have the pressure, pressure.

[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:18.660]
No.

[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.160]
We got real pressure going today.

[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.120]
No, I can wait.

[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.420]
I can't.

[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.280]
In fact, I hate to say it.

[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.340]
I don't want to be too gross, but I really desperately need to go wash my hands.

[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.240]
Okay.

[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.600]
I mean, not right this second.

[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.080]
Go ahead.

[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.020]
Dear advertiser, this is your official notification from Yahoo Inc.

[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.620]
Another fake crank email.

[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.640]
God, the crap that comes through on there.

[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.340]
All the crap is, uh, it's my specialty du jour today.

[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.500]
I am just...

[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.440]
Here's one from Mary who says subject American Idol.

[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.540]
I know you hate to show.

[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:56.980]
Correct.

[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:57.900]
I will not watch it.

[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.280]
But you have to see Adam.

[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.120]
He had an issue with a picture of him kissing a guy popped up on the internet last week.

[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.080]
I see.

[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:07.560]
Adam.

[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.220]
Hey, Adam.

[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.260]
I don't know what I'll check Adam out.

[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.120]
You have to see Adam.

[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.080]
I sure hope Adam is in his ugly as that.

[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.540]
Remember that Chuck from Chicago guy that was like, oh, my wife thinks so and so is.

[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.660]
She's got the same face as you.

[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.420]
And it was that guy from that awful TV show that real ugly guy.

[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.140]
Yeah.

[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.160]
Oh, now here comes a...

[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:26.940]
This is unacceptable.

[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.600]
Yesterday it was Mr. Radio, who was, I would say, the most anxious and unacceptable of them all,

[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.980]
although vying for that distinction.

[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.820]
Well, why is this ass clown emailing me all the time now?

[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:40.900]
Stormcat.

[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.640]
Why are you still talking about me every day?

[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.300]
You know what?

[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.400]
Don't even read this on the ear.

[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.260]
Well, I am reading it on there.

[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:48.820]
How do you like that?

[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.020]
Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh.

[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.300]
I'ma tell you.

[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:53.800]
I'm a bigger man than you.

[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.300]
In my last email, I extended a friendly hand you two days ago.

[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.460]
All I did was rip me again yesterday.

[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.080]
That's it.

[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.040]
You never listen when I call Joe anyway.

[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.680]
So how the hell do you know if I'm boring or what?

[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.380]
Even the damn beast told that I was a big part of Joe's show.

[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.360]
And you just can't let go.

[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.400]
You're like my wife.

[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.800]
Two dudes can always agree to something, but all you do is

[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.000]
yap your mouth like women do.

[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.140]
I never talk about you.

[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.900]
I don't want no beef with you, but you just can't leave me alone.

[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.880]
I'ma tell you one more time.

[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:20.600]
I'ma tell you.

[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.240]
Uh-huh.

[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.400]
This isn't Stormcat.

[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:22.980]
Of course not.

[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.600]
Cut it out and there ain't going to be no issues.

[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.460]
Don't be like a whole man's storm.

[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.440]
Oh, I'm going to be a running game.

[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.020]
They're going to be storm on the pot.

[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.300]
Wow.

[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.140]
I'm telling you, I've got wild screaming.

[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.900]
I haven't had nothing like this in years.

[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.640]
In a dog's age.

[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.280]
I'm trying to think, you know, when you have something like this,

[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:42.860]
go on.

[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:43.360]
Yeah.

[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.720]
How about asking yourself, what did I eat yesterday that inspired this?

[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:49.560]
Right.

[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.000]
Incredible, bizarre.

[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.320]
Twice you should always keep a little notebook.

[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:55.420]
Really?

[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.520]
Keep a little diary.

[00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:56.980]

[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.820]
Diary, I've got rid of that.

[00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.920]
I know I've got a big diary.

[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.480]
Not a little one.

[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.740]
Oh boy.

[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.400]
Good thing that bit lasted a minute and some odd.

[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:04.760]
Wow.

[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.840]
That was odd.

[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.020]
I mean, I'm talking about racing in there.

[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.840]
Just racing.

[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.500]
Oh.

[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.100]
Little did I expect this.

[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.560]
This must be the punishment I'm getting today in advance of that ballgame tomorrow.

[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.560]
11th, 11th, 30th, the pregame show tomorrow.

[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.440]
We got an hour and a half show.

[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:22.920]
Sweet.

[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.400]
No, how sweet.

[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.120]
Better than the Marlin days.

[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.160]
The Marlin.

[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:27.860]
Good to Marlins.

[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:30.880]
Tamarack.

[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.300]
A four-year-old preschooler caused a führer when he pulled a plastic bag of

[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.980]
Pothra and his book bag and casually told another young classmate,

[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.020]
that's my brother's weed.

[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.280]
The police report says.

[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.540]
That's my brother's weed.

[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.340]
The boy whose words caused a stir at the Tamarack preschool at 68 or

[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.040]
one West commercial boulevard spurred teacher Iris De Silva into action.

[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.220]
The Silva 45-coral springs checked the child's book bag and found tumor.

[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.680]
I wonder if she's checked the children.

[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.100]
And found two more small ziplock bags filled with marriage.

[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.260]
We need tucked inside.

[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.560]
She promptly called the sheriff's office and the child abuse outline for help.

[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.540]
A police report said.

[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.060]
According to the sheriff's office, the preschooler initially told investigators his older brother put the

[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.500]
drug in the book bag to hide it because he can't smoke it in their house.

[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.860]
He later changed his story and said he found it on a table in his brother's room.

[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.860]
The report said.

[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.860]
The boy's mother, whose name was not released, told investigators she never found marijuana in her house.

[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.940]
And there was none in this book bag when she packed it last Friday.

[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.820]
Neither the Silva nor the preschools director could be reached on Wednesday for comment today.

[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.920]
This is from the scum sentinel so there might be a little bit of truth in it.

[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.700]
I doubt it.

[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.120]
Investigators checked the child's home and found no evidence of problems the report said.

[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.180]
The marijuana was slated to be destroyed to be put.

[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.460]
The case remains under investigation.

[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.000]
You better get over to that Tamarack preschool jurors.

[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.880]
I'm going to destroy it.

[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:51.940]
I'm going to help them destroy it.

[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.980]
My piece of really good weed is his brother's weed.

[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.900]
My brother's weed, my sack.

[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:57.920]
Tell me who his brother is.

[00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.760]
I'll let you know if it's good weed.

[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.260]
And my sister's crack.

[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.960]
Oh, and the story.

[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.080]
You need to add what?

[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.040]
Can I borrow it?

[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.560]
You need to add I don't drink soda to the pool.

[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:08.400]
Okay.

[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.500]
I don't drink soda.

[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.240]
What kind of person doesn't drink soda?

[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.320]
Do you know anybody who doesn't drink any kind of soda?

[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.720]
Yeah, lots of people I do.

[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:15.860]
You do?

[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:16.200]
Yeah.

[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.820]
Get out of here.

[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.820]
See ya.

[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.380]
I don't want to let all these redig water fall on me.

[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:25.780]
What?

[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:26.660]
Sorry.

[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.060]
Go ahead.

[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.280]
Well, you're just out of control today.

[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.700]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.680]
I'd rather listen to Mr. Radio than all this rambling you do.

[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.160]
Mike says they call me Stormy Monday because I call on Monday Tuesday.

[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.540]
I can remember listening to Rick Shaw at night back in the 60s in Palm Beach County.

[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.840]
The signal was pretty strong.

[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.180]
Now you can barely hear it.

[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.060]
Whatever that means.

[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.600]
They call me Stormy Monday.

[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.280]
Oh, here's me.

[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.960]
Oh, my God.

[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.600]
I don't read the me's stuff.

[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.320]
Good.

[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:01.920]
Oh, great.

[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.060]
You know, here's a spy report.

[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.180]
I just heard the spy report.

[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:04.800]
It is true.

[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.700]
I used that drop in my Q-nundrum bit.

[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.480]
I thought our stream was down to them.

[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.960]
I'm going to be in Fort Lauderdale for Easter.

[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.700]
I'm looking forward to getting Joe's ear.

[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.860]
I was listening to your show yesterday.

[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.420]
Johnny Dark was spot on his observations about you.

[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.500]
What do you have against me?

[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.440]
What did I ever do to you?

[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.680]
You seem to be a lot more surly in your older age.

[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.740]
Now it's just a radio show and you can't handle it.

[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.420]
That's the problem.

[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.220]
Emotional cripples like you and Johnny Dork can't handle it.

[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.760]
It's a radio show.

[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.860]
All this crap about all the way you treat people.

[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.420]
What do you know about the way I treat people?

[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.760]
My relationships with my friends and the people I really care about.

[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.680]
I don't give a crap about these radio people.

[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.100]
Johnny Dark and Greg Voodell.

[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.940]
What are they to me?

[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.740]
Other sides of annoyance.

[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.040]
The real ones are the imaginary ones.

[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.380]
The distinction is subtle.

[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.420]
Here's one from Dow who says no more polls.

[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.420]
Yeah, okay.

[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.840]
Whatever you say, Dow.

[00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:58.840]
No more polls.

[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.920]
Complaints and critiques.

[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.980]
Yeah, they are exactly.

[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.820]
Complaints and critiques and life instruction.

[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:05.500]
No material.

[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.820]
Nothing to say.

[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:07.720]
No points.

[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.420]
No one's coming from people who are so much more successful than I am.

[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:10.760]
I'm sure.

[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.180]
Right.

[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.300]
I need to listen to their advice about how to do life.

[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.700]
Greg Voodell is going to have Joe's ear and blah blah blah.

[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.620]
See, that's the real world.

[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.160]
And it's Joe.

[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.460]
I don't know and I don't care.

[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.540]
I don't care about Greg Voodell.

[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.540]
I don't need to see anybody else.

[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.380]
Here's the poll for me yesterday.

[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.420]
No more polls.

[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.120]
No more polls.

[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:32.580]
Why not?

[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:33.980]
Why they don't not?

[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:35.380]
Dow.

[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.380]
I don't know.

[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.520]
Right now, my employment status is the 662 votes and then I shmit candid.

[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.580]
I didn't like that poll.

[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.620]
I'm not saying the one today is great, but that one yesterday was depressing.

[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.280]
I mean, are we going to dwell on the fact that everybody's out of work and we've got a

[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.460]
depression and I've always got any money and, huh?

[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.360]
We're going to dwell on it.

[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.420]
We're bailing out all these grave robbers, all these CEOs with their millions and millions

[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.740]
and billions and all this crap.

[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.360]
Oh, and poor Bernie made off.

[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.200]
He's going to plead guilty and go to jail the rest of his life.

[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.500]
He shouldn't be in jail.

[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.380]
He should be fried.

[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.160]
He should be eaten.

[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.240]
He should be French fried on the electorate here, right on national TV.

[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.120]
All the network should be mandated to carry it live.

[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.380]
I mean, don't you think when you rip off somebody from all their life savings, millions and

[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.040]
billions of dollars that you ought to be fried?

[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:19.520]
Yes.

[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.340]
And then eaten.

[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.120]
Right.

[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:21.700]
And not eaten.

[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.500]
Oh, fooey.

[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:23.660]
Well, I'm not going to do it.

[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.520]
No, you feed them to some poor people that he ripped off.

[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.700]
Right now, my employment status is have a job happy with it.

[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.020]
Thank you.

[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:30.640]
186.

[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.260]
Well, that's good.

[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.080]
Have a job at dissatisfied with 114.

[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.960]
I'm self-employed.

[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.240]
100.

[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.160]
Have a job and had to take a pay cut.

[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:38.640]
59.

[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.660]
Big, big ass pay cuts.

[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.340]
Cold cuts and pay cuts.

[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.080]
Retired.

[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:45.760]
49.

[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:46.740]
Have a job.

[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:47.340]
Got a pay raise.

[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:47.880]
48.

[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.360]
Thank God the pressure stopped.

[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.900]
I can be sitting here very comfortably now.

[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.120]
Oh, my God.

[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:53.660]
Good.

[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.700]
Then that was a horrendous experience.

[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.460]
I mean, just like there's no end to it.

[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.540]
Show me behind that over.

[00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.240]
Either is it?

[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.200]
I have for the moment it is.

[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.620]
Don't start trying to like inspire, you know.

[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.680]
I can't.

[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.000]
I thought to my mind, you bastard.

[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.340]
You little jerk.

[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.280]
Have a job and got a pay raise 48.

[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.800]
No job living off my unemployment.

[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:15.520]
26.

[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.620]
No job looking.

[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.740]
No job have given up looking 24.

[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.600]
That sentence there, Charlie B. I don't know.

[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.700]
Was this Charlie's poll?

[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.200]
I don't know.

[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.060]
He chased him away.

[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:25.800]
Like you do with everything.

[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.480]
No, he came back.

[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.980]
Oh, yeah, I chased everybody away.

[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.280]
That's right.

[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.720]
The ones I want to chase away like Mr. Radio, I can't get rid of.

[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.540]
No job, but my significant other supporting me 23.

[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.120]
I have more than one job, 21.

[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.140]
No job living with my parents 12 out of 662 votes.

[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.200]
There's yesterday's poll.

[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.620]
Now, now, especially since I've already been instructed, no more polls.

[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:49.800]
No more polls.

[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.800]
I mean, what is that?

[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.280]
What is wrong with some of these people?

[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.580]
Is the poll hurting him?

[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:55.500]
Yes.

[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.980]
The poll has decreased his life.

[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.720]
Oh, attention, beneficiary.

[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.240]
Here's one.

[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.120]
I love those.

[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.040]
Yeah.

[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.520]
Oh, here's Mike Smith again.

[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.380]
Stormy Monday is an almond brother song.

[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.060]
Well, good.

[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.020]
Never heard it.

[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:13.620]
Do you ever hear it?

[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.400]
Maybe.

[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:16.960]
The almond brothers?

[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.940]
I never heard a ramblin man.

[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:20.620]
We heard that.

[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.040]
No, never.

[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.020]
I don't have it.

[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:24.660]
Never what?

[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:25.180]
Stormy?

[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.580]
Stormy Monday.

[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.820]
Stormy Monday.

[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.420]
We have rainy days in Mondays.

[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.180]
And we got stormy by the classics forward.

[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.400]
Dennis Yerst is still dead.

[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.340]
But Luma, they know some.

[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.240]
We don't got no stormy Monday.

[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.820]
Got Bluma, they buy fats, domino.

[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.080]
A lot of things.

[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:38.400]
Don't you?

[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:39.340]
Yes, I do.

[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.920]
I have it by fats, domino, new order, orgy, and the cure.

[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:42.560]
How's that?

[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.860]
I'll be danged.

[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.200]
Yoshi Schmendrich says, Neil Aleyley, the show's been very entertained to me.

[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.140]
I love the email format.

[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.160]
George just wants to dumb callers back.

[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.760]
Just please explain who is Mr. Radio.

[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.400]
Sometimes I catch myself listening.

[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.460]
I can't figure out what or who you're talking about.

[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.620]
Not telling you what to do.

[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.400]
I know you hate that.

[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.880]
Just if you can tell us who these people are, especially if it's someone you don't

[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.720]
talk about very often.

[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.840]
Mr. Radio obviously is a chronic who gave himself that title.

[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.820]
Because he's a radio groupie.

[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.640]
A chronic, a jackass, a simple, an idiot, an annoying, annoying chronic.

[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.720]
Chronic, listener, chronic, fax your chronic, email your chronic, chronic, chronic.

[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:20.680]
That's him.

[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.620]
PS, my stomach is turning.

[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.480]
Now here comes this is textbook.

[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:27.300]
textbook.

[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:28.960]
Yeah.

[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.100]
PS, my stomach is turning when I think of what I have to listen to tomorrow, the Beeson

[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.300]
Zagaki instead of Neil God.

[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.860]
You don't have to listen to anything.

[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.760]
See, I really doubt that there's somebody with a gun to your head who's going to force

[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.460]
you to listen to the basketball.

[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.180]
You don't know that.

[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:41.960]
You're being presumptuous.

[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:42.440]
Yeah.

[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.740]
What I have to listen to tomorrow.

[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.220]
This is very, very sad.

[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.260]
This is just another way of screaming to the world at the top of your lungs.

[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.060]
I have no life.

[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:50.340]
Right.

[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.100]
Oh, what am I going to do?

[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.000]
I won't have Neil God, my Neil for us.

[00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:01.880]
Too bad we're going to enjoy the time off because you're a bastard.

[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.000]
Absolutely.

[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:08.740]
Yeah.

[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.500]
Can't believe the language I hear home, key reason.

[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.740]
I dropped a lot of S bombs this morning last half hour.

[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:07.220]
I'll tell you that.

[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.900]
I mean, when I'm bomb a grande.

[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:09.260]
See?

[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.380]
A thousand up 64 points.

[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:11.820]
Wow.

[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.540]
What we do.

[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.880]
Pulling his money.

[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.880]
Briefly, top 7,000 now it's under 7,000 again.

[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.180]
Briefly.

[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:19.180]
Yeah.

[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:19.860]
Of course, Maria.

[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.940]
Somewhere in my pile of crafter, I got a thing that from Maria Barthoromo, the fake one.

[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.400]
No.

[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.260]
I'm just going to take what you know.

[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.120]
Seriously, here it is.

[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.540]
Came in yesterday at 6.06 PM.

[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.460]
No, I'm going to take what you say as the emis.

[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.640]
Every email is a fake.

[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:37.200]
Right.

[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.380]
There are no real emails.

[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:40.300]
Correct.

[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.300]
Maria Bees is Mr. Rogers.

[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.020]
I have written in a while, but I have been listening.

[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.480]
As I'm sure you're aware, the markets have been under pressure recently.

[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.860]
At 6 PM, I'm just finishing up work on this tremendous day where the markets finished

[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.740]
up almost 380 points.

[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.000]
This series, the beginning of the true Obama bounce.

[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.040]
I do realize I was little bit early to the party recommended you and your listeners to

[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.040]
buy a 12,000 and then a 10,000.

[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.140]
And most of the reason that it's 8,000, but I'm sure now that we're close to 6,000,

[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.000]
it's time to buy.

[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:06.680]
Haha.

[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.080]
Oh.

[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.960]
If you start the investor your future Friday statement with me once a month, I can

[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.320]
illustrate some of the fantastic buying opportunities that will be available through the

[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.540]
company Obama bounce.

[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.820]
While I'm off to have dinner with Jim Kramer and Larry Cudlow, oh, regards Maria Be.

[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.840]
Maria Be a crazy person.

[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.300]
Here's one from the real Zisco.

[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.320]
Try taking some pepto bismol.

[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.220]
Usually does the job.

[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.580]
Take care and happy anniversary.

[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.820]
Z Z.

[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.480]
First of all, I wouldn't take pepto bismol with your mouth.

[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:40.820]
It doesn't do anything.

[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.720]
It makes your feces black.

[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.060]
That's what it does.

[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:44.780]
It does something.

[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.980]
It makes your duty black.

[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:47.800]
Dark stool.

[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.400]
Dark real dark, not dark black.

[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.600]
Black stool.

[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.160]
Haha.

[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.700]
It's okay to sit on it.

[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.300]
What is with you today with a crap?

[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.640]
What is wrong with you, man?

[00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:58.760]
Is that wrong with me?

[00:23:59.160 --> 00:23:59.440]
Yeah.

[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:00.160]
What is that?

[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.440]
I'm like evil laugh.

[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.180]
Jesus God.

[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.120]
You have that arrest put that in a drawer somewhere.

[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.940]
Save it for a day.

[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:09.540]
That blows.

[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.720]
Don't you know?

[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:12.400]
No.

[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.060]
That was up 49.

[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.380]
It's not doing much.

[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:18.900]
Orangina.

[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.640]
Oh, yeah.

[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.020]
That's in those little bottles.

[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.600]
Orangina looks like orange juice.

[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:25.320]
Never heard of it.

[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.340]
Which has some real fruit juice.

[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.800]
And it says, Mark, it's lighter and less syrup.

[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.320]
We then most sodas is Mark and Miami.

[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:31.480]
Orangina.

[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.280]
For sitting there.

[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:33.880]
It's a soda.

[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:34.280]

[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:34.820]
What?

[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:35.540]
It's a soda.

[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.920]
Here's the apple, excluding coke or pepsi products.

[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.480]
What's the, and I don't like the way this is worded.

[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.580]
What's the best kept secret or best lasting best tasting amongst the non-mainstream sodas?

[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.360]
Well, what is all of that gibberish mean?

[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.860]
Non-mainstream sodas?

[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.940]
What's a mainstream soda?

[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.420]
Like coke and pepsi.

[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.260]
But he already said, excluding those.

[00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.440]
Jesus God.

[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.780]
Is this a Charlie V1?

[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.460]
I think so.

[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.500]
No wonder Gritbydell hates him like poison.

[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.500]
386 votes.

[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.740]
Gingerail 73.

[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:10.640]
Gingerail.

[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:11.800]
Yeah.

[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.260]
Gingerail.

[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.440]
Now what brand of gingerail do we drink?

[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.460]
Canadian dry, of course.

[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.580]
Canadian dry, you bet.

[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.080]
Canada dry.

[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.440]
Not Canadian dry.

[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.200]
Canada dry.

[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.780]
No, not whatever.

[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:23.440]
Canada dry.

[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:23.900]
Never saw whatever.

[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.140]
Gingerail 73.

[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.740]
Mark's root beer 71.

[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.340]
Merch beer 57.

[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.400]
Orange Crush 53.

[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.980]
You know something I'm getting really pissed off.

[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.280]
I can't find like diet orange crush and diet grape.

[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.000]
You know, what's wrong with these people?

[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:39.580]
I don't know.

[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.340]
Order it.

[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.660]
Relentless bastards.

[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:42.720]
Order it from what?

[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.560]
From the internet.

[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.600]
Cream soda 46.

[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:47.080]
Faa.

[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.240]
Oh my God.

[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.020]
That's like celery.

[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.040]
No.

[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:51.520]
Yeah, it's horrible.

[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.200]
Cream soda.

[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.280]
Fresca 25.

[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.720]
That's one of my favorites.

[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.440]
Mr. Pib 20.

[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.780]
Squirt 19.

[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.360]
Nehygreek 14.

[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.140]
Oh boy.

[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.620]
I wish I weren't diabetic so I could drink gallons of Nehygreek.

[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.000]
I love grape soda.

[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:05.860]
I love grape juice.

[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.080]
I'd like to take, you know, those frozen welches.

[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.620]
Grape juice things.

[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:11.380]
Yes.

[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.920]
That you mix with water and you make grape concentrate.

[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:20.000]
I'd like to take a whole big lump of that and make about a 10 gallon container of it.

[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.780]
Just get it real icy cold and swill it all down.

[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.240]
I love grape juice.

[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.120]
And then fall over.

[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.520]
I don't drink soda for it.

[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.820]
Shreps tonic water for all another bad choice.

[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:29.320]
Faa.

[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:29.980]
Woo.

[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.040]
Talk about duty.

[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:32.900]
That's for booze.

[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.300]
Rafique says you mentioned Jim Rosmuthy of the Evidence.

[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.500]
He's a professor for the media department at Linn University in Boka.

[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.840]
He's a good guy, Jim Rosmuthy.

[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.720]
You don't remember him?

[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.160]
Nope.

[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.840]
First, he says, did George get into some caffeine today or what?

[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:52.580]
He's a crazy person, but it makes for entertaining, interesting day something.

[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:53.800]
Drink caffeine every day.

[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:54.940]
You're crazy to that.

[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:55.440]
You're nuts.

[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:55.980]
Yep.

[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:56.460]
My what?

[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:57.660]
You're nuts.

[00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.060]
Stay away.

[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:06.640]
David Barton took things a little too far while trying to vamp up his venue's female

[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.440]
sex appeal.

[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.140]
Thursday night opening of Dayton Barton, Jim and Miami, the police issued a ticket for

[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.100]
operating as a strip club.

[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.400]
Oh, yeah, this story is old.

[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.420]
This is from last week.

[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.460]
Thanks anyway, Mr. Phone number, but it's an old story.

[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.780]
So we're doing a soda pool.

[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.260]
You know, food pools, what eating drinking?

[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.280]
Licking.

[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.300]
This is what the public is into.

[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.180]
All of these things.

[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:32.680]
That's right.

[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.500]
Eating, drinking, and licking.

[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.140]
All depending on what they're looking.

[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.460]
Oh, speaking of taking a licking and it keeps on ticking.

[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.740]
Remember those spots, time X, John Cameron's whaisy?

[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:41.980]
Right.

[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.840]
It keeps on looking and takes a ticking.

[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.040]
And it keeps on ticking.

[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.120]
Well, what if something like that?

[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.800]
The fake Steve Rodinero says, good morning, the my crackpot investigating team.

[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.940]
Things they solve the mystery of these chronic fake e-mailers.

[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:58.040]
Carmel, Caffer, Ompatric, Fraser have deduced the problem.

[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.520]
They've deduced it.

[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.060]
They're convinced the fake e-mailers are people you cut off into past via phone call or

[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:04.380]
email.

[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.160]
They're also convinced Jolly Jo Bell has his hands tied in the fiasco.

[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.440]
It looks as if he's trying to force you to quit a retire.

[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.000]
He has the backing to help you with this.

[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.780]
He just chooses to make you when you show as miserable as possible.

[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:17.820]
Oh, I'm enjoying it.

[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:18.980]
I like the e-mails.

[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:19.660]
George hates them.

[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.680]
I enjoy them.

[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:21.820]
Not Mr. Radio.

[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:28.420]
I enjoy just about all the e-mails except for Mr. Radio and of course the fake Greg Budell

[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.280]
and the fake and the Mr. Ego ones.

[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.360]
Those are really...

[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.380]
They're pathetic.

[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:32.980]
They're sad.

[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.800]
They make you want to sit down on a corner somewhere and cry.

[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:37.420]
Hang in there.

[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.240]
You're doing a great job.

[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.820]
We enjoy listening to you up here in North Carolina.

[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.180]
You're streaming on our computer back here in the newsroom.

[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.380]
Tell George, let me know when he's up here on his vacation.

[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.320]
I'll organize a tour of the studio for him.

[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.140]
Happy Purim spelled P-U-R-I-U-M so we know it's certainly not Steve Rodinero because

[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:51.880]
Steve's not deliberate.

[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.220]
Happy Purim, Steve Rodinero.

[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:55.780]
I'll be right up.

[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.740]
Yeah, George will be right up.

[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.000]
I'll take a tour of the studio.

[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:00.540]
What town?

[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:00.960]
Can't wait.

[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.440]
Can't wait for you to send me pictures of our new studio down there.

[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.540]
Size of a broom closet.

[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.140]
I should have.

[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:07.440]

[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.940]
George says it's like doing a show from a thimble.

[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:10.700]
That's okay.

[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.240]
We can change your name to a thumb ballina.

[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:13.920]
I got a room.

[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:14.800]
It's got a window.

[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.080]
We'll be just fine.

[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.820]
It's got a window looking outside.

[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:18.580]
Yeah, I know.

[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:18.880]
Wow.

[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:19.300]
I know.

[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.900]
Outside on the world.

[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:21.740]
Unbelievable.

[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.800]
Beautiful view of a dumpster but there's a tree out there too so it works out.

[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.760]
Oh, so here's the deal.

[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.920]
The pick up pony thing.

[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.760]
We're go ahead and what?

[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:32.380]
Go ahead.

[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:33.780]
No, I don't know.

[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.340]
It's just we have to wait till we find out if the Keynes wind him off.

[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.860]
Because if there's a game on Friday, there will not be a pick up pony this week.

[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.060]
We'll push it back the next week.

[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:42.580]
Correct.

[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.260]
Moody's investor service identified 283.

[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:54.280]
U.S. speculative great companies that are at the highest risk of default.

[00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.860]
Here's the list of the broadcasters says Michelle.

[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.400]
Citadel broadcasting.

[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.560]
The old ABC radio.

[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:03.600]
77.

[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.120]
Cumulus broadcasting.

[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.440]
Emmis broadcasting.

[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.840]
That's the Emmis.

[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.400]
Next media.

[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.440]
Sirius XM.

[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.280]
Regent broadcasting.

[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.700]
Salem broadcasting.

[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:15.820]
Spanish broadcasting.

[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.120]
Corp.

[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:16.220]
Irvine.

[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.840]
Univision middle-aged broad.

[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.960]
Michelle says love the show.

[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.540]
Thanks Michelle.

[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.880]
So those are the ones that are like on the edge.

[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:23.920]
They're on the verge.

[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.400]
Time for another purge.

[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.000]
I don't think so.

[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:28.480]
No.

[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.300]
Hurricane glow.

[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.400]
Somebody says Hurricane geo.

[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.280]
What does that mean?

[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.020]
Oh, orange.

[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:38.400]
Gene.

[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.780]
It's basically carbonated water with orange juice.

[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.260]
It's excellent.

[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:42.960]
Orange gene.

[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:43.340]
Orange.

[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.500]
I don't know what that is.

[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.180]
Never heard of it.

[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:45.780]
Want me to add it?

[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.040]
Oh, here's a great viewed elegant.

[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.080]
I hope you're well this morning.

[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.500]
I'll give you $100 if you can tell me when my mustache smells like this morning.

[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.960]
Probably smells like what I just dropped in the last half hour.

[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.680]
I can't quite make it out myself.

[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.180]
Maybe you get close to give a little sniff but no tongue.

[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.260]
You should grow on.

[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.460]
Why make it look a little more porch?

[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.420]
See you soon, Greg.

[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:04.860]
Yeah, see you soon.

[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.300]
Well, where did this all come from with Greg Vidal?

[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.940]
Nobody cared about him when he was in the market.

[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.440]
And why now that he's in Alabama with his banjo pickers, why should anybody

[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.420]
care about him now?

[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.880]
Who's the one that's really obsessed with Gregory Benjamin Vidal?

[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.920]
Maybe this is all from noodles, you think?

[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.340]
There you go.

[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.560]
I sure could use some good luck.

[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.340]
I can't.

[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.860]
I'm not going to find any home untouched.

[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.740]
Maybe that would be a good assignment this afternoon.

[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.860]
Go around and look at something showed up yesterday.

[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.020]
So you must have chased.

[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.360]
I chased all the juice away too.

[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:36.820]
That's right.

[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.480]
With the home untouched.

[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.080]
Well, that's my specialty.

[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:42.700]
Chasing people away.

[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.760]
I'm going to die a lonely bit of old man.

[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.240]
This is John St. Vincent the Paul.

[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.400]
And I always wanted a glamour career with this jockey.

[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.480]
So I went to Connecticut school at bankruptcy.

[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.260]
And got this gig at an all-sports station.

[00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.860]
Changing the urinal takes.

[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.120]
And like, the bid is all pretty fast.

[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.600]
So sometimes I've got to use my fame.

[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.060]
Thank you, Connecticut school at bankruptcy.

[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:09.280]
Hi.

[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.120]
I'm kicked from the neighborhood.

[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.100]
Connecticut school at bankruptcy.

[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.820]
Now, hey, it's still funny things

[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.720]
we're supposed to do with this dying

[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.160]
whore called radio.

[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.560]
Right-wing talk is bleeding three by five cards on FM.

[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:25.900]
And sports.

[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:27.180]
Sports.

[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.120]
Whoa.

[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.280]
That's the thing we just can get as a public.

[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:32.760]
OK.

[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.500]
Here's all you got to do.

[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.700]
First you have.

[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.060]
First you have to give me $12,000.

[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.320]
First into tuition money.

[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.740]
And then I'll just go away.

[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.740]
$10.47.560 WQM.

[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.060]
So remember early in the show, Mary,

[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.920]
maybe it was the very first email that I read.

[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:50.560]
OK.

[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.920]
She said, I know you don't watch American Idol.

[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.480]
You hate it, but you've got to see Adam.

[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.200]
And so I Google Adam, his name is Adam Lambert.

[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.280]
He is number one obvious hell number to a screaming screaming

[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.860]
by the evening queen.

[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.400]
Oh my god, Mary, what kind of drugs are you on?

[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.520]
I think Mary's doing battery acid.

[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.660]
Good God.

[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.000]
But like you always say, if they're on television,

[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.860]
oh my god, they're hot.

[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:15.380]
They're this.

[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.640]
They're face on something other than their head.

[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.520]
Oh, good God.

[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.600]
It could be a wanted poster.

[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.120]
Oh, here's the fake Tom Jicke who's also the same as the fake

[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:26.640]
Greg Viedel.

[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:27.620]
I like Greg Viedel.

[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.380]
He's one of the best FM voices I've ever heard.

[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.800]
I put him right up there with Tanner Cox and Sonny Fox.

[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:32.740]
He is missed in the market.

[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:34.220]
No, he's not missed in the market.

[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.920]
He wasn't, he was never anything in the market

[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.740]
except in the real time, Jicke's mind.

[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.160]
He was obsessed with the Viedel.

[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:44.720]
Lawrence says, I don't know whether you're

[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.760]
pulled building, but if you are cactus cooler,

[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.060]
it used to be made by Canada Drya, but only regionally.

[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.500]
Now it's only available out west, sort of an orange pineapple

[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.900]
type of pop says Lawrence.

[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.280]
Cactus cooler.

[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.080]
You want to put it on there?

[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:00.960]
I don't get up to you.

[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.940]
I sure.

[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:04.880]
Why not?

[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.520]
Now, why did my friend Ken from Atobico send me this story

[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.100]
about the two teachers and the, the, the 13 year old kid

[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.740]
for Salt Lake City?

[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.420]
I don't know.

[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.480]
You know, the fake Tom Jicke is Mr. Radio.

[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:31.180]
Because now that now he's been blocked over that note,

[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.480]
no, seriously, he's, he's all of them.

[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.180]
This radio is all of these people.

[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.960]
The fake Tom Jicke and the fake Kregby to all of them.

[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.400]
That's right.

[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:37.920]
You win.

[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.020]
They made fun of him at the Oscar.

[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.660]
As America laughed at his weird bearded gum chewing

[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.080]
appearance on Lachua with David Letterman.

[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.040]
Tonight, Joaquin Phoenix will prove he's serious about his

[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.780]
pledge to give up acting for hip hop.

[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.420]
He's performing in the live tonight at L.I.V.

[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.620]
at the Thunderblow Hotel Miami Beach.

[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:54.900]
54.

[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:55.900]
Oh.

[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.040]
Phoenix will headline the dirty Harry party which

[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.140]
showcases up and coming musical.

[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:00.980]
Who cares?

[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.820]
Who the hell cares?

[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.600]
Mr. Radio?

[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:05.680]
Guaranteed that.

[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.440]
So he's all of them.

[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:06.740]
You're right.

[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.120]
And probably the fake Johnny dork too.

[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:09.700]
Yep.

[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:10.980]
Chronic.

[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.360]
And of course, who else would be that chronic?

[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.880]
Who else is as obsessive?

[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:15.340]
Correct.

[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:16.880]
Oh, how do you remember it?

[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.440]
I remember it was compelling radio.

[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.720]
How do you recall it in the old?

[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:19.880]
Right.

[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.120]
Oh my god.

[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:21.260]
It's not good.

[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.680]
Someone just like him.

[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.500]
No, I know it's him.

[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.460]
It's the real Mr. Radio who is springing forth.

[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.660]
Here's another one from Greg Vudelle.

[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.020]
I know you don't like me, but who do you like?

[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.620]
Maybe it's news to you, but a lot of people in the

[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.780]
industry don't like you either.

[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.220]
Whoa, I'm wounded.

[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.120]
See, in my case, I don't really care.

[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.040]
In your case, Greg, that's the problem, the real Greg.

[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.220]
Why does everybody hate me?

[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.260]
Oh, man.

[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.660]
I heard through the grapevine that management was

[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:48.820]
praying you would have run away from the

[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.100]
lobe ball off of the gave you last year.

[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:50.720]
Too bad.

[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.420]
Fooled them.

[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:53.820]
They were planning on making a big offer to Dan LaBasta

[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.280]
to do mid days on WQAM.

[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:55.980]
Well, guess what?

[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:56.500]
Didn't happen.

[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.340]
Did it?

[00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:58.600]
You turn on everyone.

[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.140]
I'm surprised to have him turned on George.

[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.500]
I've shared emails and messages with Mr. Radio.

[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.700]
He seems like he means well.

[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.400]
Johnny Dark has one of the best radio voices I've ever heard.

[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.980]
I'm surprised he is not in the air somewhere.

[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:08.540]
Well, guess what?

[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:08.920]
He's not.

[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.660]
You are the ringleader of negativity.

[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:16.420]
Greg, aka Mr. Radio, aka Johnny Dark, aka Fake Time Jika, aka

[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.540]
crazy person.

[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.260]
But you know what?

[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:19.720]
Keep him coming.

[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.000]
I enjoy them.

[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.740]
See, you get all bent out of shape because I don't get bent out of shape.

[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.600]
Yeah, you can do it.

[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.280]
I can't afford off my gourd.

[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.640]
Well, so forget about it.

[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:27.640]
Just sit back in the middle.

[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:27.780]
I know.

[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:28.980]
Smoke a big family and relax.

[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:29.460]
I have.

[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.920]
You got free food coming into Marvel.

[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:31.800]
You're off 1130.

[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.260]
Look kind of bright side and quit being so.

[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.980]
You sound so comatose.

[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.080]
Negative.

[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.080]
I'm obvious.

[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.640]
You sound coma induced.

[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:40.920]
Induced.

[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.920]
The thou's up only 31 points.

[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.380]
This is what keeps us a going here.

[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:46.960]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.200]
Oh, my God.

[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.240]
The ray with a poll too many poll suggestions.

[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.000]
The most memorable day in my lifetime was the day blank.

[00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.300]
Well, it's not a bad poll.

[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.320]
It's pretty good poll actually.

[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.080]
But I'd rather have stuff, you know, people saying something.

[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.600]
You know, Neil, Neil Rogers, dot com.

[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.960]
Oh, now, flee being the astute guy that he is.

[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.380]
Now, let me just see if they changed it.

[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:16.940]
He put out a memo yesterday to a Josh Cortis to change that link on the QAM.com

[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.600]
to our email.

[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:19.520]
You're going to test it.

[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:21.480]
Yeah.

[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.860]
I'm going to test and see, you know, contact our hosts.

[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.920]
That things been on earth staler than oh.

[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.640]
How do you do it?

[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.400]
You click on it.

[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.600]
It's on what?

[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.500]
Hosts.

[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.280]
Neil Rogers, OK.

[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:44.220]
I clicked on the.

[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.220]
Neil Rogers, nothing happened.

[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:49.040]
Oh, there he there I am.

[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.280]
OK.

[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.680]
Oh, and this has got a bunch of drop-ins too on there.

[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.160]
Doigoy, doigoy, about 30, et cetera, and so on.

[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.240]
Where's the thing to email me?

[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.460]
I'm looking to.

[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.080]
It's not there anymore.

[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.300]
Neil, Neil, the change day.

[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.640]
Right under your picture, radio.

[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.900]
Oh, well, how would you know to click on that?

[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.240]
You mouse over it and it changes.

[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.060]
Oh, yeah, but how would you know to do that?

[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.920]
And I'm clicking on it and guess what?

[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:24.800]
What?

[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.260]
Nothing is happening.

[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.020]
Why don't you try clicking on the CFN and do it?

[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:31.860]
Link to the website.

[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:33.860]
It did what?

[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.020]
I'll let you know in five minutes if it does something.

[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.180]
Well, no, this is doing nothing.

[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:41.360]
And mine is quick as grease lightning my computer as you well know.

[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.080]
It did nothing.

[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.660]
Oh, now there's the thing.

[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:55.440]
The box finally popped up after a long, long, long wait.

[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.520]
And now I can't get rid of it.

[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:56.960]
There it goes.

[00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.000]
Jesus, God.

[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.400]
Brandon says, two sodas I'd like to add to the poll, Iron Beer.

[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.720]
A root beer type soda that came from Cuba.

[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:10.300]
It's quite good can be found in Spanish restaurants and publics in South Florida.

[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.840]
Iron beer, you got it?

[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.440]
Got it.

[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.440]
Hires root beer.

[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.160]
Good root beer I haven't had maybe 10 or 15 years.

[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.340]
You don't find it here in South Florida.

[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:17.720]
Hires.

[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.980]
Now, Hires was I think from Rochester once upon a time way back in the day.

[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:30.480]
When a Rochester had like business, you know, like Eastman Kodak and Hikki Freeman and Hires root beer and like that.

[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:31.520]
So we had that?

[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:33.440]
Hires root beer, sure.

[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:34.100]
You like it?

[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:34.820]
I like it a lot.

[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:35.740]
I like it just fine.

[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.220]
I don't see.

[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.960]
I don't see Hires diet root beer anywhere.

[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.740]
I don't see diet much, much of anything.

[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.740]
Is it an apostrophe S kind of a thing?

[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.480]
So you don't know either?

[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.540]
I don't know and I don't care.

[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.480]
I'm laughing because what the hell differences are making?

[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.600]
Oh, you know these people.

[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.420]
You made a mistake.

[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.120]
Good.

[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:55.880]
Good.

[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:56.900]
Let's make a lot of mistakes.

[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.940]
I made one mistake today and that is showed up here.

[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.360]
So I could hear from Mr. Radio and to Craig B. Udell and to say, oh my God.

[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.960]
See that Mr. Radio or across the street, they're just losing.

[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:07.960]
They have no more material.

[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:08.920]
So it's all the same.

[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.960]
It's probably, you know, tubby boy.

[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:12.900]
Mm-hmm.

[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:19.040]
An anti-Christian chapter in Western history is about to begin, but out of the ruins, a new

[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.860]
vitality and integrity will rise by Michael Spens.

[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:28.860]
Why did somebody send me this long, ponderous article, long, crappy article?

[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:31.600]
Crazy people.

[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.380]
Ginger L seems to be hitting the spot.

[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.400]
It's 82 vote, although.

[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.720]
Barks root beer is up there.

[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:38.740]
I bet your hire is.

[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.420]
Although you can't find hires in South Florida.

[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.220]
I voted for the barks root beer.

[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.380]
Did you really?

[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:43.680]
Yep.

[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:48.140]
I like barks just fine and actually once upon a time I used to be able to find barks diet root beer.

[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:48.980]
That's right.

[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:49.480]
That's what I like.

[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.080]
But I don't find what?

[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:51.680]
You drink diet?

[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:52.760]
Diet root beer.

[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.820]
I drink diet soda if I do drink soda.

[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:55.760]
Now why is that?

[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.340]
I like the taste better.

[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.880]
The sugary sodas are like syrup in my throat.

[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.760]
Oh, two sweet.

[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:01.140]
One of these.

[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:01.640]
Yeah.

[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.620]
Like Adam from American Idol, two sweet.

[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:04.040]
Yes.

[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.940]
Mary, you need some serious assistance, honey.

[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.040]
She thought I was going to like that thing?

[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:10.420]
That's the thing.

[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.340]
It's like the thing.

[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:17.100]
He's like, I put him in the same category with the thing with that old pinstribe suit.

[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.520]
Adam, a screamer, flamer.

[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.480]
That's one thing about American, man.

[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.880]
And it would know a screamer if they bit him on a lip just like Jimmy Cifolis, you know.

[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:26.760]
Oh, no.

[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:27.320]
Yeah.

[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.740]
This is the Neo-Roger show.

[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.540]
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, it's your brain.

[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.500]
Any questions?

[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.360]
This empty building is like a tomb.

[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.120]
I walk it's always at night.

[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:46.540]
I check to make sure the doors are locked tight.

[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:50.820]
When I hear him noise, I investigate with my flashlight.

[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:51.420]
No.

[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:57.020]
What are you doing here? My coffee is black. I drink it

[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:10.300]
From the visionary director of 300 why would I protect the building? I don't have any stake in it because it's your job

[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:16.000]
Well, it's a really crappy job if you don't mind me saying and why are you naked and painted blue night watch man

[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:20.400]
The world will look up and shout save us

[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.020]
And I'll whisper

[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.000]
No

[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.280]
No, I can't

[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.500]
I'm just a security guard

[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:36.260]
But they won't hear me because I'm whispering night watch men and I have a stained-afflinux shock over my face

[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:44.980]
All right George loved it by the way light lots gobs hated it just seen it eyes three times already

[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:48.180]
Right to the world all just clinging from it put George

[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.600]
BAM BAM

[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.040]
That's me

[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:55.740]
On somebody sends me a thing a bio of Steve Rondon arrow. Oh, you've been duped

[00:42:55.740 --> 00:43:01.320]
Yeah, like I believe it's Steve Rondon arrow. I don't believe I think you're right none of the emails are are who they say they are

[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:08.880]
Very jackass breaking news the hero laying off 175 employees all staff taking pay cuts at the hero

[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.920]
Thanks for the good news very good well deserved

[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:20.180]
Brandon says since we're on a soda trip today just wondering when the last time was you had a really good old-fashioned ice cream float

[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.920]
Well, I had a float this morning between about 10 and 10 40

[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:29.220]
Oh my was a floater down speaker talk about float your boat

[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.480]
I wasn't a huge fan of them but they were good on those hot summer days

[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.140]
He says you'll you'd be able to find those good floats same place you'd find an egg cream

[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.860]
But soda fountains are long gone and once they're gone

[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:43.160]
Also while he's on it because he up rings up a good point the young root beer floats like a day in W

[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.880]
Those frosted bugs they were great

[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:52.120]
Can you add to the pool stewards orange cream if you haven't tried it a highly recommended says array

[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.780]
It used to be available with publics you can get it any cracker barrel and some grocery stores

[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.420]
It's available in regular and died. It's good

[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:04.000]
Stewards orange cream never heard of it. You ever heard of as for W. Sturts?

[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.060]
STW right Stuart like Ron Stewart of the Maple Leafs number 12

[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:10.280]
From a hundred years ago

[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.760]
Greg B. Nelson you've got it on mr. Radio AK Yentaman

[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:21.200]
Have you heard what Steve Kane has been saying about you? No, I haven't heard it neither is anybody else because nobody listens to nobody cares

[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.860]

He's gonna come by and give you a big kiss right on the lips with his mustache with his free mustache

[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:39.440]
Pete from Boka I love soda, but I've reached the point in my life where sugar is not an option to my diet

[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.840]
I just quit drinking soda pop recently and I'm missing it much I

[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.480]
Tried diet soda. I hate the aftertaste. I just don't buy that I

[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.980]
Mean yeah made like tab or some of those had bad aftertaste

[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:56.940]
But diet soda don't have no aftertaste in the olden days with saccharine you bet right that's right

[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.140]
Saccharine right

[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:05.780]
Like the red buty del show is saccharine, but no it is it's good syrupy the diet soda is a good note like Jimmy's syphilitic

[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.000]
Not all emails are fake. I promise you this email is real says Pete from Boka

[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.620]
I just can't always take time to write while I'm at work. I heard you read the

[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:18.700]
Email the other day about the type on your website being a big jagged and the email are offering to fix it

[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:22.200]
I agree I'm the guy who fixed your car tune a few months ago

[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.020]
Most people never realized these little details, but web designers other geeks like us do

[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:30.520]
So we can't help but make you wear these little imperfections due to our aesthetic OCD

[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.140]
If I had time it offered redesign your website unfortunately too busy presently

[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:39.680]
I'll I'll give fire to have plenty of time promise. I'll be vampir site to the best it could be

[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.400]
Well, thanks Pete from Boka and nice offer there. Yes

[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:49.320]

[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:57.500]
Joseph's I remember someone complaining the other day about Bob and Tom laughing too much during the attached bit

[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.640]
Bob pretty much loses it, but I love these guys are great

[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.800]
He's got an attachment which I just a little off for it to me

[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.960]
Okay, let me go back play it if it's airworthy, you know

[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.220]
Here it is let me forward it

[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.240]
I

[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:27.560]
One moment please okay

[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:34.540]
Which one of these is oh here it is forward here we go. Sorry. Sorry. I'm my bad. I mean it might be funny

[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:41.220]
It might be funny. Well, we can't afford to be passing up any potentially funny bits these days

[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:44.760]
It's there are so few we try to say that we can't be funny anymore. Is that what you're trying to say?

[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:49.140]
That's the good you must be psychic. Oh, Adam Oshmuck says add in Kakola

[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:56.560]
I've only been able to find the publics. It's amazing. Oh, Adam Oshmuck had publics. I thought Adam was at the kitchen or waterloo

[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:01.140]
Well, they have publicses up there. No, we don't have no publicses in Canada. No, we absolutely do not

[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:04.420]
Maybe in kitchen or waterloo. They do what I'm sure they do not

[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:11.440]
Don't tell me Adam Oshmuck is also a fun in us. They're all fun in us now. Now here is

[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:13.560]
Here is a self

[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.480]
defeating goofball

[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.500]
Adrian Cook systems engineer chronic

[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.720]
subject olden days

[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.760]
Now I want to tell you who Adrian is yesterday

[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:31.400]
He sent me an email along with which I already had a vet article about from Vanity Fair about the Godfather Wars and the audio

[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.860]
23 pages and

[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:38.500]
Suggested his suggestion was I should read the whole thing on the ear because I have such a great voice

[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:44.700]
And I read the bedtime story so well and trying to kill the show. I mean talk about Pandora's reading a 23 page story

[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:51.980]
And now he's giving a critique complaints and critiques George on caffeine is his terminal is a snail crossing the desert

[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:55.500]
Like I said before we suggest to his job and stay on off the mic

[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:59.580]
Remember how he used to complain about Greg Reed who would have thought that could get worse?

[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:05.720]
Bell and Joyce Fitz have brought the entertainment level of the show to a slow drip IE occasional funny segments here and there as

[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:11.800]
Supposed to the olden golden days bring back Greg Reed well guess what Adrian Greg Reed ain't coming back the olden golden days

[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.180]
Ain't coming back and you're an idiot

[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:19.240]
Give me a son of dance about I should read the 23 page story on here real expert programmer there

[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.840]
Idiot. Oh there he goes again calling names

[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.080]
Downs up 47

[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.400]
That's it

[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:38.760]
What I'm looking at the email thing that's it I got it bitterly disappointed

[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:42.240]
I'm very gave us some real exciting news there about the hero laying off all those people

[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.640]
157 employees and everybody taking a big pay cut I

[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:52.220]
Think the hero in the sun settled between the two of them are gonna be like 10 pages a day after after maybe Monday

[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:59.680]
It's really bad. Oh well no more newspapers no more TV no more radio no more

[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:06.160]
What else is going on do no more cars no more jobs no more money

[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:12.700]
No more not oh well you hear what Steve Cain's been saying about you

[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:18.060]
That sounds like that Lee founder thing. I think that's maybe it's a gym scholar doing these things

[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.920]
Well, I'm starting to sound like him

[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:29.640]
Remember that pit where he says you if you heard what Joey Reynolds has been said by that's a young girl

[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.220]
Same thing

[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:37.720]
Keats is the best carbonated drink is the Jamaican pineapple soda. They sell in the ethnic section of the grocery store

[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:46.660]
You will find an exit each making cream soda, which is also very good. Yo George don't forget about iron beer Cuban soda. How are back Keith? How are back?

[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:51.820]
It's on there. It's on there iron beer and it's suggested it did he not I don't know

[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:56.360]

[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:03.980]
Here's somebody who says my favorite soda is RC cola. Thanks. Love you show. I haven't had RC cola in a coons aged man in a long time

[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:06.160]
I like RC. I like RC just fine

[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.000]
Kind of a redneck you think though RC cola

[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.460]
Nothing wrong with that

[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:16.160]
I don't know why BC powder and RC cola anything with initials. That's right. You can get him at Windix

[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:18.420]
WD

[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.260]
That's right

[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:26.360]
Kathy O'Brien says may I add cherry seven up to the pool good stuff. You're right great stuff even the diet very good

[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:29.940]
I agree and the fame of these people are

[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:36.660]
Missing sodas there are places online that sell soda in the case

[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.400]
mainly, but if it's that good why not

[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:49.040]
Places online where they sell sodas quick drinking so much soda you can go get anything online order it have a shift to you very Jane

[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:56.780]
Candy I'm talking right hey Neil. Can you please add ale eight to the pool? It was very popular back home in Kentucky

[00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:00.780]
It's like ginger ale but a little fruity or kind of like you it says

[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.800]
Great show George Dan and Del Ray

[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.400]
It's got a picture of the stuff

[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.400]

[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:13.460]
Okay, like the AL in the number eight okay

[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.060]
Got it can you handle it good handling it

[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.880]
You know

[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:24.260]
Neil did you hear that Brittany was in Brickle at the Mandarin Oriental for the past few days and it's gotten article here

[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:28.040]
Brittany back in Miami for retail therapy and relaxation don't know don't care

[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.020]
Don't care. Maybe Paco would care. I don't care

[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.960]
non-interested in that bitch

[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.480]
Here's the story and Barry Jack asked it was right on target. See you're so skeptic about all all these people

[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.040]
Maybe one out of a thousand things that we get on here is a legitimate city MS

[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:48.400]
I didn't say that the info well wouldn't be accurate once in a while or maybe even all the time

[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.280]
What did you say that they're not who they pretend to be

[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:56.360]
No, we know that handful of people ready. We know that cross the street and you know and mr. radio

[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.280]
Right and mr. Egos crowd. Oh

[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:03.400]
Yeah, but his stuff is all in this teeny tiny print. That's all they can afford over there

[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:09.940]
I challenge you to a debate about jake mirage you

[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:11.800]
Yes, screw you

[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:18.180]
Like somebody cares about me these people who are like long since vanished from the local radio scene

[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:24.500]
All like suckling around here like oh, we want Neil to put us on the map. Well, guess what good luck to you won't help

[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.620]
It won't help

[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:34.460]
The publisher the hero says about 175 employees will lose their jobs as the newspaper cuts cost in a memo sent today

[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:41.260]
David Landsberg said remaining full-time staff led their salaries reduced those employees will also get one week unpaid furlough

[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:43.220]
Is starting in April how do you like that?

[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:45.420]
Even you didn't get that

[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.620]
No, one week unpaid furlough in other words like a layoff for a week

[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:54.800]
The heralds executive editor editor anders gillinhall. I wonder if he's kin to jake

[00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:00.260]
Said in a separate email the layoffs include 33 full-time and eight-part-time news room positions

[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.800]
He said summer rainy staff will see their hours cut

[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:08.920]
Landsberg set other costs cut cutting missions include eliminating 30 vacant positions and leasing one floor

[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.520]
The heralds downtown Miami headquarters all management bonuses have been cut this year too

The paper's owner mcclatchee company order the cuts. Well good cold cuts

[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.600]
How do you like that?

[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:25.520]
The herald vanishing from before our very eyes. Well, that's good news

[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.600]
If anybody deserves to go away

[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:29.300]
It's the herald

[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:36.340]
No, we don't agree for our results. Our best star does what now? We just got to get the sunset. No, they're already pretty much vanished

[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:37.400]
They're down to about two pages

[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:42.720]
They got the front page and then they got the comics page and the editorials and that's it

[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:47.960]

Why you got to take everything so personal I wasn't taking a shot of you know that

[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.820]
That's not the point the point is here's a guy that's talking about the entertainment level being down

He wants me to read a 23 page article about the godfather. Wait till you hear this

[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:55.180]
Why you got to take everything so personal I wasn't taking a shot of you when I said the entertainment level of the slow

[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:02.160]
Show it's down to a slow drip. It's just that you can't do anything more that made you the entertainment god that you are plus when the show gets godfather intensive

[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:09.220]
It's effing great regards Aadrian well, that's because that's what you're interested in not everybody wants there a 23 page freaking article about the godfather

[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:10.060]
including me

[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:15.400]

[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:33.740]
Seems maybe is what you should allow a segment out of the four hours for him to talk instead of having him babble and mumble throughout it

[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:37.040]
Just a suggestion, but is talent since to pop

[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:38.060]

This is Alice

[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:50.800]
Alice has no comment on the guy that filled in for him that Conway guy for about five minutes

[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:54.520]
And then got canned

[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.920]
Because some dirty jokie taught him onway Jr

[00:59:58.580 --> 00:59:59.300]
That's the one

[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:01.560]
Who is Tim Conway Jr

[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:07.960]
I'm going to just go on that Tim Conway used to be on the kill Bernadier. I'm presuming. Oh

[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:15.560]
know. I don't know that. He wasn't funny at all. You liked him Conway? Yeah. Just a

[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:20.720]
old guy. I like that show. A Charlie Burnett show. Yeah. A tarviacorn. A tarviacorn

[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.840]
thing was very funny. Although they had some sketches where they came together really well.

[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:29.080]
Mickey Lawrence. Sure. And then Carol doing that thing with her earlobe. Yeah. That's right.

[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:37.640]
For her mom. Oh yeah. For your mama. Blackie says, I thought you'd be squeezing yourself

[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:42.460]
about this top secret info I sent you. You should read the info on Mr. Rodinero. A lot of

[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:48.260]
compelling info. Hint. Joe Bell. It's a must read. It can solve the connection between Mr.

[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:53.600]
Bell and Mr. Rodinero. Have to get back to band practice with the riffraffed. Cheers, Blackie.

[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.240]
Why don't we care about the real or imaginary Steve Rodinero? Nobody cares about him. How about

[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.820]
white rock sodas? We drink him a Kelly's diner says Blackie. Here here, white rock soda.

[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:13.320]
No. No. Have some. What? White rocks. Glad to hear you're still on since the Chris.

[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.880]
I picked up on you here in Palm Beach, the banana republicans. I listen to you when I worked

[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.660]
in Palm Pato Beach. Are they still dumping Schmidt in the water there? Haven't heard any callers?

[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:29.240]
Do you have finally become too much to become too much? Yeah. I'm not interested. My

[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:39.300]

[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:49.140]

[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:54.900]
What language you people speaking? Joe Bell says just linked just inked motor to your

[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:58.540]
contract as a peace offering this time. He's buying the pizza. Now who did more for the

[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:03.340]
new Roger show? I think Joe Bell is the obvious answer. Love Joe Bell. Yeah. That'll be the day I

[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:08.560]
get an email from Joe Bell on here or or at all. Except what was the thing he sent me the other day?

[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:15.980]
Oh, he was forwarding one from the real Greg Budeau. Right. A lids. Oh, God, I have breakfast when

[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:20.120]
I come down and the have a chat with you, Joe. Yeah. The real Greg Budeau has been trying so

[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.000]
desperately to muscle his way into this show for years and years and could have happened Greg

[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.420]
loser written all over your forehead. In fact, Joe Bell is probably the only one in the market that

[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:33.780]
would dignify your existence with any time assuming that would happen. Let me know when Greg comes

[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:38.260]
by and gives you a big kiss on the lips. Watch out for that tainted Mustang. Oh,

[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:45.980]
me. The hurricane. I ain't blowing. 911. Do you need police fire and ambulance? Holy

[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:53.560]
where? I'm going to collect all the phone. What's going on there? I ordered a

[01:02:54.220 --> 01:03:00.140]
pink chicken nugget with a small flight as you say that they didn't have any chicken nuggets.

[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:06.020]
As far as I want to make that with a small flight, you'll see that my laptop is anything out

[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:11.340]
from the menu because you can't reply on the different page out of the mirror and that's all

[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.980]
there. Just give me all my money back. If she said she can't give me my money back here,

[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:18.820]
she will have to. I have to pick something. There's no manager there.

[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:23.880]
Now you ready to spoke with the manager? She spoke, she ought to manage that. She's saying,

[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:28.780]
something about she just can't respond in my money. That's fine. But she don't have one of

[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.520]
the men that I want to want to chicken nuggets. That's what she did. And that's five 12

[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:36.780]
million dollar laptop. And just to find the difference. As you say, she can't do that.

[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:47.260]
She can't reply on my money now. She don't have one of the men that I want.

[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.420]
Now let me pause then. Are we going to have an interpreter for this bit or what?

[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:53.220]
Wow.

[01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:58.800]
What's your name?

[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:01.800]
What's your name?

[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:01.840]
What's your name?

[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.440]
What's your name?

[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.120]
What's your name?

[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:11.020]
Lucretia Borgia. I can't take any more of that. Do you find that funny?

[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:16.160]
I didn't even know what it was. It's about the tick that went one to the refund on the

[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.460]
McNuggets because they didn't have any McNuggets and she wanted a money back and they wouldn't give it to her.

[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:22.920]
That's a bit. That's what passes for bits these days.

[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:31.740]
That's right. It's a new story and so they made it a three and a half minute bit out of the

[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:36.400]
poll. Excluding Coke or Pepsi products. What's the best kept secret or best tasting among the

[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:42.480]
non amongst the non mainstream sodas? Boy, this has got to be a Charlie B. Poll. You talk about a

[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:46.780]
pseudo intellectual pile of crap the way the question is worded. God.

[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:53.200]
If you can say it in five words, Charlie can say it in 10,000. Well, it's in your real 86.

[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.120]
Mark's root beer 83. Were you going to say something there? No.

[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:04.680]
There you were. The longer it takes you to read, you know, the less you got to say.

[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:09.940]
I don't want to read that long. Oh, and by the way, where's that before I read the poll?

[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:14.360]
Stephen New Jersey says, I don't know why you don't want to read the 23 page Godfather Wars

[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:22.460]
article. I'm reading it now and it's in fact, yeah, it's interesting because I got that I got that

[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:29.440]
email simultaneously. They got a message on my blackberry that said, yeah, from up to

[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:34.900]
out. What's it? It's not even noon yet for crying out loud. Wow. Party all night. Sleep all day.

[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.220]
That's the Mexican way. I don't think it's the Mexican way. I think it's the young punk way.

[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:41.420]
If you can pull it off, yeah.

[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:49.060]
Ginger, 86, barks root beer 83. Birch beer 66. I like that a lot. Me too. Like in the frosted mugs

[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:07.220]
Well, that's a week number. Fresca is good crap, man. I drink it all the time. Fresca. That's why

[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:41.820]
cherry soda. How could we not have that on there? He says best with a thick, thick greasy corn

[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:50.660]
beef sandwich on rye with mustard. Absolutely correct, David. Am I right? Is he right? Dr. Brown's black

[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:54.200]
cherry soda. You got a cherry soda, but I don't care whether you like this isn't the

[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:58.180]
whole question isn't what is George like best. I thought that's what you just asked. What?

[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:03.280]
You said am I right? Are you putting it on there? You said am I right? So yeah, I'm putting it

[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:11.020]
on there, but you said am I right? And I said no. You're starting to sound anti-semitic again.

[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:16.360]
I like Dr. Brown's just I don't like cherry sodas of any kind. You don't like cell ray? No.

[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:22.400]
What can Dr. Brown do you like? Like the root beer? The cream soda is good.

[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:29.880]
One thing about root beer it's almost always good. Right. It's got some taste to it. It's got some

[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:36.800]
zing, some pizzazz, some something as opposed to this show which used to have a coin to that

[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:42.880]
Schmendrich there with his 45 page article. Everybody's an expert do this do that by any

[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:50.220]
know something doesn't phase me in the least doesn't phase me in the least whether it's the

[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:54.720]
real Greg Bidell the fake Greg Bidell the real joy when it makes no difference to me.

[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.600]
The fact that it's amusing to me that I can make four hours out of this

[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:06.280]
Kakarai everyday and actually you know make it fairly entertaining. That was down three points.

[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:09.980]
Not good down. Got to got to go up and not down.

[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:16.520]
Sud says Tim Conway, Jr's Tim Conway son. Very funny guy. He was part of the whole KLS X crew

[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:22.500]
that got the rubber key a few weeks back. Damn it. That's the real suds by the way. Yep.

[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:29.220]
When you tell me that everybody on here is fake. Barks root beer and Mr.

[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:35.280]
Pib are both Coca-Cola products we need says somebody. Well how do you like that?

[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:40.880]
I guess we screwed up our own pool. Oh so we're Dr. Pepper and Mr. Pib.

[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:47.200]
The pool needs to say excluding Coke or Pepsi not products. Would you like to change it?

[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.580]
Yeah let's change it get the word products out of there.

[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.620]
I can know I shorten the rest of the channel.

[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:59.920]
Well what I'm sure we meant by that or Charlie meant by that is like you know zero

[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:05.060]
Diet Coke, caffeine-free diet all of those.

[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:11.000]
Coke whatever but just take the word products out there and that'll solve the problem weenie weenie.

[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:13.120]
You made a mistake. You made a mistake weenie.

[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.340]
Bap bap bap bap bap.

[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:22.080]
Missing can fields diet chocolate fudge on your pool. Thought they didn't make it anymore but I

[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:32.320]
found it for sale online. Same site hometownfavorites.com has tab. Oh Fui. Feth.

[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:37.600]
Six pack of tab 475. They'd have to pay me 500 bucks just to take it man. Never would drink it.

[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:44.140]
You're asking if they still made tab while they do that's bad news. Bad news for you.

[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:48.460]
Bad news for you and bad news for me if you can't make that deal with the centino.

[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.820]
How do you like this the rewarding of the question I'll change it if that's not to your liking.

[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:56.840]
Excluding Coke or Pepsi what's the best tasting? What's the best tasting what?

[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.740]
What refresh soda. Soda. Well put the word soda there. What's the best tasting?

[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.840]
Body. What? I said refresh it's in there.

[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:12.460]
Is that it? What's the most refreshing? Yes. Good battle going on here between Ginger

[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:19.200]
Rail and Barx root beer. I can't imagine. I mean I like ginger rail just fine. I never buy it.

[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.300]
Well I mean I won't say never. You know what's good when you got a cold. When you're sick.

[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:26.760]
When you're sick. Right. Nothing like ginger rail. I don't know why. Chicken soup and ginger

[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.800]
rail. That's all you know. That's right. When you're ailing.

[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:37.900]
But other than that I never buy it. Right. And Barx root beer I don't see the diet ever so I don't

[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.980]
buy that either. I see it. Public. I do see diet doctor pepper not the caffeine free though.

[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:48.660]
I don't think a lot of these they make him caffeine free. Correct. Well why is that? That sounds

[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:54.980]
like a chamepico plot. We we fat sick diabetic people we want our choices okay. That's right.

[01:10:54.980 --> 01:11:00.540]
We're going to sue somebody pretty damn soon. I think you know what I'm thinking I just it just

[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:05.720]
dawned on me. What? Remember how I used to say that Joe Bell had the callers he had pro-zek Ron

[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:12.800]
and Chamba sitting in a room in a conference room orchestrating the calls. Well he's also got two or

[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:20.460]
three people sitting in the same conference room orchestrating the emails. You're indeed. Joe Bell

[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:26.500]
is the fake Greg Videl the fake Steve Rodinero the fake all of these people is not so jolly Joe Bell.

[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:31.480]
Trust me. George NSL Corvo Nugo the QAM. Tonight on Fox,

[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:37.760]

[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:48.380]
Maho Rushdie grant you permission to do that speech? Oh how about Reagan's speech ending the cold

[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:54.240]
war? No. We need something from a more influential conservative. Well I think I'll just let the

[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:58.540]
idle voters be the judge since you're nothing more than an entertainer and I am the leader of the

[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:03.480]
Republican Party. What was that? I'm sorry. I said that I apologize for twisting your words. Good.

[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:10.900]
Now do something from Limbaugh circa last week. Well I want the president to fail because he's a

[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:18.340]
Democrat. Yes I believe we have our next Republican idol and it's me. Tonight on Fox, Republican

[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:23.920]
Idol. Hold it my friends. Don't you mean Rush Limbaugh idol? Oh I'm sorry. I didn't mean to

[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:30.480]
imply that it wasn't your show. Please let me live. Maybe. 1145 a QAM so Scott sends me the joke that

[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:37.560]
got Tim McConway Jr. fired. Yelp for KABC. This is all of this joke was told on air at 97.1FM

[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:43.920]
was deemed unfit for KABC 790. Adorded or salesman rings the doorbell a seven year old boy opens the door.

[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:49.000]
He's totally new to cigar in his mouth. His mom's panties on his head and he's covered in KY jelly.

[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:55.380]
The salesman asked the boy if his parents are home. The kid replies what the F do you think? Only

[01:12:55.380 --> 01:13:00.380]
evidently Conway said the F word. I say it. And Scott says saying F on any station will you

[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:09.280]
fired I think yeah I think so Scott. Yeah now anybody who's who's like really a broadcaster or

[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:14.380]
belongs on here doesn't know that you don't say the F word on the year I mean how wow and that was the

[01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:21.360]
one that was filling in for Alice Rantel for Alice. So it wasn't a joke that got inspired. No it was

[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:31.740]
the F word a word right. I mean it's some moderately amusing joke coming old old old old and yeah

[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:38.420]
what the F do you think are are are yeah yuck yuck yuck I felt the sunset he was a funny guy

Romulan ale and he says IBC Roopier sold the most area of public says you don't remember Fago? No

[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:16.540]
Just like now I buy fresco all the time I used to buy Fago. Maybe that's what put me over the edge.

[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:24.400]
What happened to the original red net cracker cola 3v it says the bottle was extra funky too. Steve

[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:30.120]

[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:41.440]
things made in Rochester like me. Strong Memorial Hospital November 5th 1942. I was born I'm going

[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:34.780]

[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:43.340]
how is it well what's the reason that this email thing has has brought out of the woodwork all these

[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.520]
chronics well well what's the reason for that that's a rhetorical question right in other words

[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.620]
because why are they there because they can't be because now you can't recognize their voice now

[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:55.160]
they're a different person every time they write you now you can't hang up on them from the sound

20 or 30 products and that way you sell a schmitt load the hell of a lot more of it

Mary Tyler Moore not to push it the original 16 ounce bottle to compete with coke and Pepsi at

[01:50:33.250 --> 01:50:39.150]
the same time with three v and it's got pictures of it it says Pepsi was originally marketed as

[01:50:39.150 --> 01:50:44.330]
giving more value than coke during the depression remember the little coke bottle sure you take one

[01:50:44.330 --> 01:50:48.910]
swig of that and you're all done in fact some places you go in and they still have those little

[01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:55.470]
coke bottles and they bring your glass of ice and you pour that little tiny amount of coke in

[01:50:55.470 --> 01:51:01.230]
there and the bottle is empty and the glass is only like half full and if the ice wound in it would

[01:51:01.230 --> 01:51:07.210]

[02:08:34.250 --> 02:08:38.150]
Don't drink soda 24 well excuse us. Okay excuse us

[02:08:38.670 --> 02:08:42.150]
3.6% of this snooty audience don't drink no soda

[02:08:43.090 --> 02:08:46.570]
They're probably eating chat tobury on and drinking champagne

[02:08:47.690 --> 02:08:52.450]
Dr. Pepper 20 iron beard 12 IBC root beer 8 higher's root beer 8

[02:08:52.450 --> 02:08:58.250]
Trepsonic water 8 Dr. Brown's black cherry soda 7 not just for juice RC cola 6

[02:08:58.250 --> 02:09:02.150]
Stores orange cream 6 Mountain Dew 5 cherry 7 up 5

[02:09:02.150 --> 02:09:03.750]
Furnars ginger ale 4

[02:09:05.410 --> 02:09:07.850]
Fui just go chew on some out tree somewhere

[02:09:08.850 --> 02:09:12.130]
Guarana 4 chastitu Fagos got to Fagola

[02:09:12.890 --> 02:09:20.190]
Al 8 2 cactus cooler one and none yet for some kids to even treat cheer wine or thumbs up well all night hoopla about cheer wine

[02:09:20.190 --> 02:09:20.910]
Do I have any votes?

[02:09:22.110 --> 02:09:25.110]
Think a lot of hoopla had several comments on that no votes

[02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:29.790]
662 on the full we're inching our web to 666

[02:09:29.790 --> 02:09:32.850]
Of course that probably exceeds the number of people can hear our signal today, but

[02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:39.290]
664 we need just two more and I hear a knock on the door not

[02:09:40.070 --> 02:09:41.990]
They made constant it's Wednesday oh

[02:09:43.090 --> 02:09:46.530]
So two o'clock I'm right now got my shirt and my pantaloonies on

[02:09:47.150 --> 02:09:52.090]
During this first break I'll put my shoes on other reason I mentioned this is because there are a lot of people out there like that Twitter crap

[02:09:52.090 --> 02:09:57.710]
That's right. They're twittering it down. Oh my god. What what what who's responsible for that? How do we get rude?

[02:09:59.150 --> 02:10:04.610]
Some lifeless hole what are you talking about? Oh, Mr. Radio or someone just like don't you remember we both got those

[02:10:04.610 --> 02:10:09.270]
Invitation to join mr. Radio on Niels Twitter. So I don't have a Twitter page or a Facebook page

[02:10:10.230 --> 02:10:11.990]
The douse down 22 points

[02:10:13.650 --> 02:10:18.010]
You notice how matter of fact they're said that yep. Oh, here's an email about the rankings

[02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:24.930]
The rankings that you just read by Mercer is for within city limits

[02:10:27.110 --> 02:10:28.210]
As you know

[02:10:28.210 --> 02:10:35.010]
No cities in Florida actually have a large enough population living within city boundaries to qualify for being included in that list

[02:10:35.010 --> 02:10:40.250]
Calgary population 1.1 million Ottawa 1.2 million Miami population for 100,000

[02:10:41.690 --> 02:10:44.910]
Oh, I see so in other words if Miami had more people in it

[02:10:46.330 --> 02:10:48.050]
Then am I qualified for ranking

[02:10:50.430 --> 02:10:51.810]
You believe that

[02:10:52.890 --> 02:10:58.970]
What whatever I guess we have to well then we need to get on like Ray Perry would say we need to bring a whole lot more people to Miami

[02:11:00.730 --> 02:11:02.210]
Get that ranking way up there

[02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:05.110]
You're gonna get a spanking if you don't get a better ranking

[02:11:07.610 --> 02:11:14.430]
So how about that syrup palen about that trailer trash family and all those people said oh, they're good Christians. Yeah, right

[02:11:15.330 --> 02:11:20.470]
They're what's wrong with American Christianity. They're what's wrong with trailer trash no

[02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:22.470]
The palen family they're what's right with it?

[02:11:23.090 --> 02:11:28.270]
And what are they? Well, let's go to the break thing. I think what's his name is leave us if they weren't leave eyes coming

[02:11:29.310 --> 02:11:31.510]
I got that no, you got you guys coming

[02:11:32.350 --> 02:11:35.270]
By three dogs night. Thank you Kathy for sending that to me

[02:11:35.710 --> 02:11:41.630]
She sent it to you. Yes, and where's it? I'm looking for it. Oh, he's looking for it

[02:11:41.630 --> 02:11:44.670]
I'll think it's a giant says hey old man growing up in the 70s

[02:11:44.670 --> 02:11:47.170]
My dad would take me to a place called the sub center

[02:11:47.170 --> 02:11:52.330]
It was close by the right and festive place Coney Island on 163rd Street North Miami Beach. Yeah, that place was filthy

[02:11:53.070 --> 02:11:54.590]
Food was good though Coney Island

[02:11:55.450 --> 02:12:01.570]
But it was notorious for being filthy anyways. They had deep-brox soda my favorite was either black cherry or cream soda

[02:12:01.570 --> 02:12:05.690]
Always listening take care. Fago was back in my Michigan days boy

[02:12:06.590 --> 02:12:09.530]
How fast 40 years goes by just like like that?

[02:12:10.570 --> 02:12:13.570]
Like this that's it like that. Yeah

[02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:15.830]
All

[02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:17.310]
Almost enough to make me want to play that

[02:12:17.850 --> 02:12:21.170]
A hundred years gone by almost I said right

[02:12:22.990 --> 02:12:28.070]
Now if you got you guys coming by three dog night or you just just teasing us. Let's take it forever to download here

[02:12:28.070 --> 02:12:29.490]
Oh my god

[02:12:29.490 --> 02:12:33.330]
Well, that's because you're equipping there is so antiquated well when you move into the new digs

[02:12:33.330 --> 02:12:34.590]
You're gonna have like all brain new equipment

[02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:39.570]
Huh your funny guy once your show starts

[02:12:41.190 --> 02:12:46.350]
10 to 11 30 tomorrow and hopefully 10 to 11 30 on Friday go change. We love the hurricane

[02:12:47.590 --> 02:12:48.270]
Wow

[02:12:48.270 --> 02:12:50.450]
You lie

[02:12:55.650 --> 02:12:59.930]
Levi's looking for whoa yeah, jump back

[02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:05.270]
That was on 32

[02:13:06.290 --> 02:13:06.690]
Oh

[02:13:09.130 --> 02:13:10.190]
Here we go

[02:13:14.450 --> 02:13:16.070]
Okay, that's one of their worst songs

[02:13:16.970 --> 02:13:20.650]
I like three dog night just fine, but that I don't like that song. Do you like that song?

[02:13:21.750 --> 02:13:23.450]
No pretty weak pretty mediocre

[02:13:24.090 --> 02:13:28.990]
There are no grassroots. I'll tell you that that may be the most underrated group of all time from it from that era

[02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:33.690]
The grassroots can we agree on that what argue with you

[02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:39.810]
They are just fine and ugly too, but they still make good music

[02:13:39.810 --> 02:13:41.290]
You don't have to be good looking to make good music

[02:13:41.290 --> 02:13:44.630]
In fact, the odds are if you are good looking you're gonna make bad music like Joey Jonas

[02:13:45.790 --> 02:13:47.190]
Who's working on our bonus

[02:13:48.610 --> 02:13:51.910]
Oishmoiju says the pain on clan is nothing more than trailer trash living in a house

[02:13:52.850 --> 02:13:56.970]
The way they paraded that pregnant slut around the RNC convention was nothing short of a side show

[02:13:56.970 --> 02:13:59.190]
That is correct. It was a side. It was a freak show

[02:14:00.010 --> 02:14:03.830]
That whole two-thousand the way they were passing around the baby. Oh, it's a little baby

[02:14:03.830 --> 02:14:05.490]
It's a little baby

[02:14:06.090 --> 02:14:11.450]
Her little deformed baby that remember that one and they kept passing it around like some kind of a I don't know

[02:14:12.070 --> 02:14:14.770]
Like the like the gold phone in the godfather too

[02:14:15.970 --> 02:14:17.430]
Remember the gold phone in Havana?

[02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:23.290]
Yes, when they were all sitting around the big conference table there with Batista full-hensio Batista

[02:14:24.010 --> 02:14:25.930]
I'm going to pass that around yeah

[02:14:27.470 --> 02:14:27.970]
And

[02:14:27.970 --> 02:14:29.870]
Remember a hymen Roth he took a look anyway

[02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:38.070]
Fat the whole two thousand eight election first was just another scam forces on the American people says Oishmoiju

[02:14:38.070 --> 02:14:42.190]
We haven't had a legitimate president since JFK. What what does that mean?

[02:14:42.690 --> 02:14:44.630]
The two thousand eight election farce

[02:14:45.650 --> 02:14:51.170]
We are the most controlled society on earth nothing personal just businesses Oishmoiju. You're not can president

[02:14:51.170 --> 02:14:53.650]
What's his name Obama you shame on you

[02:14:55.490 --> 02:14:56.010]
Oh

[02:14:56.010 --> 02:14:59.190]
Oishmoiju probably uh go like Schwarzenegger that's probably the problem

[02:15:00.170 --> 02:15:03.730]
The dead-bobblacidus says Virgil's root fears the greatest never heard of it

[02:15:03.730 --> 02:15:07.610]
I heard of Virgil trucks used to pitch for the tigers and the white socks. He's dead

[02:15:08.490 --> 02:15:12.450]
Virgil trucks keep on trucking Virgil on those members websites in advance

[02:15:12.450 --> 02:15:17.650]
So the public and the press can examine president on president vows to hold the pork all right

[02:15:17.650 --> 02:15:22.090]
We shouldn't want to get involved in that no way

[02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:29.770]
Ron says I just tuned in to do you guys keep this one around yet best wishes Jersey Ron formerly a South plantation

[02:15:29.770 --> 02:15:32.870]
P.S. I'm glad I'm in Jersey couldn't find birch beer much in Florida

[02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:40.830]
And the story is Florida lawmakers consider ban on bci outy. They're considering it pushing legislation that would make having sex with animals of felony

[02:15:40.830 --> 02:15:41.970]
They're thinking about it

[02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:46.790]
Most other states it's an o-brainer in Florida. They're like sticking and thinking about it

[02:15:47.630 --> 02:15:50.250]
Who's gonna get a bricky of bloke

[02:15:56.690 --> 02:15:57.270]
B

[02:16:08.910 --> 02:16:11.110]
Rates are on the list this is

[02:16:11.110 --> 02:16:11.250]
Oh

[02:16:14.010 --> 02:16:14.590]
One

[02:16:35.090 --> 02:16:39.150]
Oh, let me take a look at the security moderner.

[02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:40.630]
Anything to do with sports?

[02:16:40.630 --> 02:16:43.530]
Well, just a lot of buildings burning and carnage.

[02:16:43.730 --> 02:16:44.870]
My car's okay though.

[02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:46.730]
Go back to the files.

[02:17:09.410 --> 02:17:12.310]
Well, this is kind of interesting in a very bizarre way.

[02:17:12.410 --> 02:17:13.650]
Now really, it says you are correct.

[02:17:13.650 --> 02:17:17.670]
A fantastic band, Burton Cummings, had one of the best voices in rock and roll history.

[02:17:18.130 --> 02:17:19.190]
And it's the thing about the guest who.

[02:17:19.370 --> 02:17:21.290]
I love the guest who except for him personally.

[02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:23.950]
But did I mention anything about the guest who?

[02:17:24.050 --> 02:17:25.010]
No, I thought we were talking about the grassroots.

[02:17:25.330 --> 02:17:27.510]
I'd said the grassroots, not the guest who.

[02:17:27.730 --> 02:17:32.930]
He begins with a G. God, G. Wiz, G. Willockers.

[02:17:33.650 --> 02:17:34.830]
I mean, tell me about it.

[02:17:35.690 --> 02:17:36.330]
There we go.

[02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:37.990]
Midnight Confession.

[02:17:39.290 --> 02:17:39.650]
Yeah.

[02:17:42.470 --> 02:17:43.690]
You're going to talk it up or what?

[02:17:44.170 --> 02:17:45.490]
No, I'm absolutely not.

[02:17:49.010 --> 02:17:51.090]
Telling me that you're on the air.

[02:17:51.770 --> 02:17:52.350]
Okay, it's enough.

[02:17:53.130 --> 02:17:53.670]
I love the grassroots.

[02:18:11.430 --> 02:18:14.370]
Oh, that's for today.

[02:18:14.630 --> 02:18:15.230]
I like this a lot.

[02:18:15.510 --> 02:18:16.430]
It's a good plan too.

[02:18:17.010 --> 02:18:19.050]
Let's search for it tomorrow when we get off at 1130.

[02:18:19.150 --> 02:18:20.050]
Sounds better, I do to me.

[02:18:20.390 --> 02:18:21.890]
I think of all the words.

[02:18:21.890 --> 02:18:23.470]
After a great lunch from the sea old.

[02:18:26.090 --> 02:18:26.270]
Right.

[02:18:26.730 --> 02:18:27.250]
Oh, what a day.

[02:18:27.350 --> 02:18:27.890]
What a bananze.

[02:18:27.890 --> 02:18:29.170]
You guys coming tomorrow evening?

[02:18:29.170 --> 02:18:29.330]
Good morning, Jason.

[02:18:29.510 --> 02:18:29.810]
Great job.

[02:18:30.110 --> 02:18:32.110]
You might have to bring me that child up to Taylor's soup.

[02:18:32.710 --> 02:18:34.390]
I'm glad that we are different.

[02:18:34.890 --> 02:18:36.450]
We better things to do.

[02:18:36.570 --> 02:18:37.530]
I want a bat of it.

[02:18:37.670 --> 02:18:38.950]
I want a tank on the wheels.

[02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:43.830]
One, two, three.

[02:18:44.270 --> 02:18:44.730]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:48.170 --> 02:18:48.810]
Go ahead.

[02:18:49.670 --> 02:18:50.150]
Okay.

[02:18:51.170 --> 02:18:57.010]
Any laws concerning bestiality would not limit the trading in stump trade goats and the subsequent

[02:18:57.010 --> 02:19:01.330]
exponential rise in in bread idiots in the red neck community says Nick.

[02:19:01.630 --> 02:19:02.410]
Yeah, that's a good point.

[02:19:02.510 --> 02:19:07.910]
No matter how many laws they pass, but nevertheless, I'll get to that maybe and maybe not.

[02:19:09.530 --> 02:19:13.350]
Lindsay and Miramar says, my favorite soda as a kid was Tahitian treat or big red.

[02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:14.610]
Totally it was red.

[02:19:14.650 --> 02:19:15.530]
It was like purple red.

[02:19:16.290 --> 02:19:17.950]
You can't find either of them in South Florida.

[02:19:18.170 --> 02:19:19.210]
It was like Hawaiian punch.

[02:19:20.570 --> 02:19:23.550]
But most things people are not found in South Florida says Lindsay.

[02:19:24.050 --> 02:19:27.450]
Also, I was listening to Alan Combs on the radio the other night and Prozac Ron called

[02:19:27.450 --> 02:19:28.030]
it into the show.

[02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:30.130]
Maybe he's got a new friend.

[02:19:30.970 --> 02:19:35.370]
You can tell it was him because of his annoying voice and he started going on a rant about how he and his mom

[02:19:35.370 --> 02:19:36.790]
just had to know with the mayor of Davy.

[02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:38.910]
It was nice to see he was harassing someone else.

[02:19:39.250 --> 02:19:39.690]
Love your show.

[02:19:39.790 --> 02:19:40.690]
I look forward to it every day.

[02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:41.790]
Thanks, Lindsay and Miramar.

[02:19:42.330 --> 02:19:43.450]
I wonder if that's mufflinzy.

[02:19:44.350 --> 02:19:44.830]
You think?

[02:19:44.830 --> 02:19:45.470]
No.

[02:19:46.810 --> 02:19:51.730]
Now here again, these people from the Miami Chamber of Commerce working feverishly to try to convince me of something.

[02:19:52.010 --> 02:19:53.090]
What that is is I don't know.

[02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:56.730]
Toronto has about seven times the amount of land that Miami has.

[02:19:56.830 --> 02:19:58.410]
Yeah, that's right because it's a real big city.

[02:19:58.690 --> 02:20:01.790]
It's not just just a bunch of bedroom towns all hooked together like South Florida.

[02:20:02.850 --> 02:20:04.750]
I've always said, Miami is just a big hick town.

[02:20:04.810 --> 02:20:09.610]
I said that way back in 76, 33 years ago, plus a big hick town.

[02:20:10.850 --> 02:20:12.730]
All these bedroom towns disconnected.

[02:20:13.050 --> 02:20:14.110]
In fact, this bears it out.

[02:20:15.090 --> 02:20:22.590]
At only 35.68 square miles of land area, Miami has the smallest land area of any major US city with a metro area released to and have been in people.

[02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:25.950]
The city proper is home to less than 113 South Florida residents.

[02:20:27.370 --> 02:20:31.910]
Additionally, 52% of the county's population doesn't live in any incorporated city.

[02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:35.610]
Miami is the only major city in the US bordered by two national parks.

[02:20:35.610 --> 02:20:43.630]
Every glades national park on the west and biscuit national park on these, that in 40 cents will eat with turt of a cup of coffee at Tim Hortons.

[02:20:45.490 --> 02:20:46.870]
So what are they trying to peddle me?

[02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:47.610]
Well, what's the point?

[02:20:47.770 --> 02:20:48.830]
That's just a small hick town.

[02:20:48.930 --> 02:20:49.390]
I know that.

[02:20:49.530 --> 02:20:50.090]
I don't know.

[02:20:50.470 --> 02:20:53.090]
I mean, to say that Miami is like a major city is a joke.

[02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:57.590]
Comparing Miami to Toronto is like comparing the

[02:21:00.570 --> 02:21:02.790]
P.W. baseball team to the Yankees.

[02:21:02.890 --> 02:21:03.990]
I mean, I just just don't get it.

[02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.590]
Do you understand it?

[02:21:05.090 --> 02:21:05.290]
No.

[02:21:05.390 --> 02:21:06.190]
Because you never been to Toronto.

[02:21:06.650 --> 02:21:06.970]
No.

[02:21:07.470 --> 02:21:08.050]
Well, why not?

[02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:09.170]
That was down seven points.

[02:21:11.490 --> 02:21:14.810]
Kathy says, I hate to disagree with George, but Fago diet so does work.

[02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:15.030]
Great.

[02:21:15.410 --> 02:21:15.570]
Well,

[02:21:20.610 --> 02:21:23.330]
George never said they were good or bad because he never heard of it.

[02:21:23.370 --> 02:21:24.110]
I've never seen it.

[02:21:24.250 --> 02:21:24.590]
That's all.

[02:21:24.690 --> 02:21:25.630]
Well, they just want to disagree.

[02:21:25.810 --> 02:21:26.250]
I know. That's fine.

[02:21:26.250 --> 02:21:26.810]
Yes, they're tough.

[02:21:26.810 --> 02:21:27.070]
Good.

[02:21:27.070 --> 02:21:27.710]
It's.

[02:21:27.710 --> 02:21:29.410]
It's Also it's a schaffen.

[02:21:29.410 --> 02:21:29.750]
That's not fine.

[02:21:31.170 --> 02:21:31.810]
Eा!

[02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:56.230]
They have their own fruit感 and they have pretty good taste at that.

[02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.970]
The Levi's coming.

[02:21:59.630 --> 02:22:01.250]
Rouse says, how about Nesbitt Orangin,

[02:22:01.290 --> 02:22:02.230]
Grand Pog, Graff's Root Beer,

[02:22:02.310 --> 02:22:02.990]
Popular In The Midwest,

[02:22:03.170 --> 02:22:03.950]
Never heard of either one of them.

[02:22:04.190 --> 02:22:05.150]
Well, Nesbitt Orangin maybe.

[02:22:06.290 --> 02:22:07.150]
I think I heard of that.

[02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:07.630]
Do you hear that?

[02:22:07.750 --> 02:22:07.830]
No.

[02:22:10.710 --> 02:22:12.790]
Now, what are what kind of sodas were big in New York?

[02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:15.790]
Like when you went to Athens to get a weed,

[02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:16.450]
a couple of winters?

[02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:17.150]
Nehy.

[02:22:17.610 --> 02:22:17.910]
Nehy?

[02:22:18.250 --> 02:22:18.530]
Sure.

[02:22:19.070 --> 02:22:20.710]
And of course, Dr. Brown.

[02:22:20.950 --> 02:22:21.350]
I imagine.

[02:22:21.470 --> 02:22:22.970]
But Dr. Brown was in the delis, you know.

[02:22:24.730 --> 02:22:25.530]
Dr. Brown.

[02:22:26.790 --> 02:22:28.710]
What's the big, I mean, Dr. Brown is okay,

[02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:29.370]
but what's the big,

[02:22:29.370 --> 02:22:30.010]
Simmons with it?

[02:22:30.170 --> 02:22:30.630]
That's it.

[02:22:31.250 --> 02:22:32.010]
Is for Jews?

[02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:33.070]
It's fine.

[02:22:33.230 --> 02:22:33.490]
It's great.

[02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:34.490]
Do you like it?

[02:22:34.650 --> 02:22:34.830]
Yes.

[02:22:35.210 --> 02:22:35.730]
It is good.

[02:22:36.210 --> 02:22:38.630]
Dr. Brown's.

[02:22:38.910 --> 02:22:40.370]
Andres says, the best sodas,

[02:22:40.490 --> 02:22:41.870]
Inca cola, Inca d'incadue.

[02:22:43.570 --> 02:22:44.810]
Jimmy Duranty loved it.

[02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:46.070]
I can't get you.

[02:22:46.090 --> 02:22:47.890]
It says, it's like a champagne sweet,

[02:22:47.950 --> 02:22:48.890]
and I's almost like pineapple.

[02:22:49.410 --> 02:22:50.610]
It's a Spanish Spixot,

[02:22:50.610 --> 02:22:52.570]
a great usually found in Spanish restaurants.

[02:22:52.570 --> 02:22:53.290]
It is really,

[02:22:53.930 --> 02:22:54.130]
incredible.

[02:22:54.190 --> 02:22:54.690]
It is Andres.

[02:22:55.210 --> 02:22:56.810]
I wonder if he's keen to Andres Tegovia,

[02:22:56.990 --> 02:22:58.250]
the great classical guitarist?

[02:22:58.750 --> 02:22:58.910]
No.

[02:22:59.130 --> 02:23:00.170]
Or maybe Andres Cantor.

[02:23:02.170 --> 02:23:03.410]
The soccer announcer?

[02:23:04.890 --> 02:23:06.090]
We don't have that anymore, do we?

[02:23:07.490 --> 02:23:07.650]
Yes.

[02:23:08.370 --> 02:23:09.790]
Brazil, do we have it?

[02:23:09.930 --> 02:23:10.050]
Yes.

[02:23:10.650 --> 02:23:11.310]
Is it in the thing?

[02:23:11.710 --> 02:23:11.930]
Yes.

[02:23:12.570 --> 02:23:13.150]
What's the Andres?

[02:23:13.210 --> 02:23:13.470]
Andres.

[02:23:14.550 --> 02:23:16.110]
Are you, are you kidding me?

[02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:18.470]
Andres Cantor.

[02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:20.610]
Aitla de la Reva de Tobajos

[02:23:22.470 --> 02:23:28.390]
See how it goes on a cup of Aitla de la Reva de Tobajos.

[02:23:28.650 --> 02:23:32.750]
Let me know how you are.

[02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:32.750]

[02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:34.090]
The ball's beat.

[02:23:36.010 --> 02:23:36.410]
The ball's beat.

[02:23:36.410 --> 02:23:37.130]
The ball's beat.

[02:23:39.070 --> 02:23:40.130]
The ball's beat.

[02:23:41.530 --> 02:23:41.550]
The ball's beat.

[02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:42.930]
I'll take up to the ramp of Brazil.

[02:23:43.290 --> 02:23:43.390]
Yes.

[02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:45.430]
Take a pill, rhymes with Brazil.

[02:23:47.230 --> 02:23:53.130]
Brazil is a hell of a place to understand where the men are men in the store most of the women but nevertheless I always say that but I just read that you know

[02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:57.190]
Not a drag queens like like that the creature that what was his name Adam?

[02:23:57.870 --> 02:24:02.510]
From American Idol okay, he was trying to palm off on me good God what a screamer

[02:24:03.610 --> 02:24:03.970]
Golly

[02:24:05.410 --> 02:24:09.910]
I'm sorry. I don't want to sound like you know a bigoted old bag, but I am I just I just

[02:24:09.910 --> 02:24:15.510]
Just can't deal with it with what drag queens named Adam. Yeah, I'm American Idol and

[02:24:16.290 --> 02:24:20.670]
People trying to pretend that they're like oh this guy is what what's he supposed to be talented?

[02:24:23.090 --> 02:24:27.110]
He wants to be a dancer that's his next thing I was reading he wants to be a dancer yes

[02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:31.430]
What's the word tight panth and do a dance and do a dance in his pants?

[02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:38.430]
That's what mine do in a dance and Levi's pants. Yeah, I'm obsessed now would leave I know that his story and somebody send me that picture

[02:24:38.430 --> 02:24:42.810]
You can send me a lot more pictures of Levi by the way if you got him once his last name again

[02:24:42.810 --> 02:24:44.390]
Strauss Levi Harner

[02:24:44.930 --> 02:24:45.890]
I don't know

[02:24:47.690 --> 02:24:50.430]
Levi Harner and Eldon Harner his son. They're both dead

[02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:55.690]
Legendary harness racing names leave our harner for years

[02:24:55.690 --> 02:25:01.990]
He held a trotting record of a TV down to the horse named rodear 201 flat. What a memory for just obscure crap

[02:25:02.450 --> 02:25:07.510]
Aren't you embarrassed for me a little bit? I?

[02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:09.190]
Wonder if David Vance is in his pants

[02:25:10.590 --> 02:25:15.150]
Too bad Dick Feinberg's out there in California now and not enjoying all this harness racing trivia

[02:25:15.650 --> 02:25:19.970]
686 on the pull our goal 700 I feel really good about life in general

[02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:25.550]
Oh, and you know what we got a good pull for tomorrow when I was in it when I was a child the first adult

[02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:27.590]

[02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:32.190]
I want we have to add like entertainer on there. It's not on it. We'll do it tomorrow

[02:25:33.090 --> 02:25:37.310]
Because I don't want to change the podium because this one is a going over like Mary Tyler Moore and flatbacks

[02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:42.990]
What kind of people say flap jacks red necks. Yes, flap jacks

[02:25:44.590 --> 02:25:46.230]
Don't give any flat jack

[02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:52.870]
Got my shoes on now aren't you proud of me as punch I'm ready. I'm gonna be busy this afternoon

[02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:58.790]
I'm gonna be really busy Paco's got some business to take care of. He's busy and I'm busy. Everybody up here is busy and

[02:26:00.210 --> 02:26:04.010]
The weather I don't know kind of a mixed bag was supposed to be 12 today

[02:26:04.010 --> 02:26:07.310]
54 but that was like early in the morning and now it's going down all afternoon

[02:26:07.310 --> 02:26:13.930]
I hate those kind of days when it starts out kind of like mild and then through the day it gets bitter and cold and windy and it's

[02:26:13.930 --> 02:26:15.310]
Supposed to though it's 35

[02:26:16.770 --> 02:26:18.630]
Aren't you thrilled as punch

[02:26:27.250 --> 02:26:30.490]
Hey, Farrell, fight away, son. I've been given it some

[02:26:30.490 --> 02:26:31.310]
Do I see?

[02:26:32.490 --> 02:26:37.490]
Where did that come from? I know what me and you can do I'm blueberry much. I didn't hear no

[02:26:37.490 --> 02:26:46.870]
Go in six to ten and I did five a gentile in the cranky jewel. I think we might be happy to get there

[02:26:46.870 --> 02:26:54.350]
I think you really got out of your mind. You got to have your weary bag

[02:26:54.350 --> 02:27:01.610]
Strasse on to tight no chance on toy show with you. I'd rather die with the grassy together

[02:27:03.850 --> 02:27:10.350]
Why I'll have you know that I'm a big puppy Jew or Brooklyn height

[02:27:12.250 --> 02:27:16.450]
I've been raised in high everybody but you

[02:27:16.450 --> 02:27:17.910]
You're not high

[02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:18.450]
I

[02:27:19.410 --> 02:27:20.710]
Me and my

[02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:30.050]
No way that if we had a fight that you'd survive would want to hear a gentile and push it tight

[02:27:30.050 --> 02:27:31.930]
That's happy together

[02:27:50.990 --> 02:27:57.870]
Sure with you and me for me is much better six to ten than I'm five it's only right

[02:27:57.870 --> 02:28:04.230]
That I should get for sleep at night. I think we might be happy to get there

[02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:05.750]
What's with what?

[02:28:06.610 --> 02:28:07.870]
Happy to get there

[02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:08.910]
What's with what?

[02:28:09.630 --> 02:28:11.310]
What can you be better?

[02:28:36.590 --> 02:28:40.910]
One thirty three at five sixty WQA. I'm happy Wednesday too. Don't forget we got that hurricane

[02:28:40.910 --> 02:28:45.670]
basketball pregame at eleven thirty tomorrow morning. Oh yeah. We aren't gonna forget

[02:28:45.670 --> 02:28:49.990]
our way even though it took Fred Souter and a bunch of other people to tell us. I still can't get

[02:28:49.990 --> 02:28:55.370]
over that people emailing us about you know the canes got a basketball. Yeah we know we know

[02:28:56.150 --> 02:29:00.230]
you know though what and if they win tomorrow they play again on Friday we're out of here

[02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:06.290]
eleven thirty on Friday. All right and if that happens if they should play on Friday we're preemptive

[02:29:06.290 --> 02:29:09.370]
for the last part of the show. Well push the pickup pony thing back to next week.

[02:29:11.050 --> 02:29:16.930]
Well he said it takes a little pressure off me a lot of pressure pressure. Randy says have you

[02:29:16.930 --> 02:29:21.510]
read Obama's audacity of hope? No I have not. I just finished listening to the book on tape

[02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:26.710]
read by the author and enjoyed it very much. He gets it. If BO can accomplish half of what he wants to

[02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:32.510]
do and everybody thought of our president with those initials BO but it is. He could be one of

[02:29:32.510 --> 02:29:36.270]
the it could be one of the greatest accomplishments in US history until recently Clinton was my favorite

[02:29:36.270 --> 02:29:40.950]
president ever but Obama might now be one of my favorite people ever. If you haven't read it or

[02:29:40.950 --> 02:29:46.690]
listen to the audacity I very strongly recommend it. You're going to read it to me? No good.

[02:29:48.050 --> 02:29:53.770]
I'll pick it up. Fanta somebody says member Fanta Orange right? Fanta grape.

[02:29:55.990 --> 02:30:03.170]
Somebody sends me a long long study by Irish Cheskin director of the Jewish

[02:30:03.170 --> 02:30:11.230]
Demography project at the University of Miami and the consensus is the Jewish population of

[02:30:11.230 --> 02:30:18.790]
Broward County is shrinking. The Jews are running away. The 2008 study updates the Jewish community

[02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:22.750]
study of Broward County completed by the author for the Jewish Federation of Broward in 97.

[02:30:24.830 --> 02:30:32.730]
In 2008 206 700 persons lived in 100 thousand Jewish households in Broward. Of the 206

[02:30:32.730 --> 02:30:40.390]
700 persons in Jewish households 185 800 people are Jewish the rest of Margot in 97 269

[02:30:40.390 --> 02:30:45.870]
thousand lived in 133 thousand Jewish households in Broward of the 269

[02:30:45.870 --> 02:30:51.350]
thousand 100 in Jewish households 240 thousand were Jewish so from 1997

[02:30:52.590 --> 02:30:59.490]
240 thousand Jews in Broward now only 185 thousand so 55 thousand Jews of vanished wouldn't be the

[02:30:59.490 --> 02:31:06.230]
first time. From 97 to 2008 the number of Jewish households decreased by 33 thousand and the

[02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:14.030]
number of persons in Jewish households decreased by 62 thousand 400. Wow. Well this goes on numbers.

[02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:18.670]
Lots of number you're mailing it in with the numbers only Northwest Broward shows an increase

[02:31:18.670 --> 02:31:23.690]
the number of people in Jewish households from 1997 to 2008 decreases are seen in North Central

[02:31:39.810 --> 02:31:46.390]

[02:31:46.390 --> 02:31:53.410]
and pages wow whoa this evening has a map where you'll find sunny Rosenberg is that

[02:31:53.410 --> 02:31:59.130]
side of a bitch still alive that old goat. And what was that other guy in hellendale

[02:31:59.130 --> 02:32:03.870]
the city manager. Oh my keys trying to give me off here what that was his name.

[02:32:04.910 --> 02:32:08.630]
That's before your time. Never the last it's in bits. Ray Ray something. I don't know.

[02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:14.530]
Somebody will know the city manager of hellendale oh what a place all I can say is.

[02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:18.510]
Although I do miss Manero's that was a good restaurant wasn't that the name of it. Maybe

[02:32:18.510 --> 02:32:22.390]
where they had the blue cheese dressing on the salad. Oh god was that good.

[02:32:23.550 --> 02:32:28.450]
Takes a lot to get me excited about a salad. The only other salads I got excited about were the

[02:32:28.450 --> 02:32:33.810]
salads with the honey mustard dressing at Houston's. Yes they had good salads. I wonder

[02:32:33.810 --> 02:32:37.190]
what ever happened in our show. We never heard from our show again. I'm pretty sure he's around.

[02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:42.190]
I wonder if he's still what do they call that stuff. Ambrosia. Ambrosia very good I can never

[02:32:42.190 --> 02:32:45.290]
remember but you got it right there on the tip of your time with those little tiny marshes. I did

[02:32:45.290 --> 02:32:48.850]
cannot. I should have some of the tip. Well maybe they'll bring it tomorrow from the field.

[02:32:49.070 --> 02:32:53.450]
I know just potatoes from left field. Some bangers and that. Before I come in the studio tomorrow

[02:32:53.450 --> 02:32:57.770]
Levi's going to be sitting here waiting for me. You know you're closer to him than we are. What do

[02:32:57.770 --> 02:33:01.990]
you mean by that? Well he's up in the last year. Oh that's right he's north to Alaska. I forgot

[02:33:01.990 --> 02:33:06.070]
about that. Yeah do as go west. Zip right on down here. Maybe he'll zip down and unzip.

[02:33:07.530 --> 02:33:12.090]
Levi he's a pretty young man and pretty smart to get the hell away from that bitch too.

[02:33:13.430 --> 02:33:18.510]
Put on a big dog and pony show for the public. Oh yeah they're getting married in the fall and

[02:33:18.510 --> 02:33:24.890]
yeah right. Slut the mother's a slut the daughter's a slut the apple don't fall far from the pair.

[02:33:24.890 --> 02:33:28.150]
I'll tell you that. The palan's.

[02:33:31.890 --> 02:33:37.090]
David says has anyone been over the north beach epicure since the open last fall? No.

[02:33:37.770 --> 02:33:42.230]
They have some great kid that's where the rascal house used to be. Can you believe a south

[02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:48.930]
road without the rascal house? Wow that that's like QAM without coming out.

[02:33:49.230 --> 02:33:54.250]
Without that. It's a sense that they open. They've got some great kishka in a particular

[02:33:54.250 --> 02:33:58.170]
interest this time of the year. Home in Toshin to die for. Oh I'm sure that the epicure is great.

[02:33:58.510 --> 02:34:02.450]
At least the one on the beach always was. They got like those pre-packaged foods you know.

[02:34:03.070 --> 02:34:08.410]
They got package deals as Winery would say. I still can't believe he's dead you know. I mean

[02:34:08.410 --> 02:34:12.690]
there's a lot of people who are dead that I you know I can believe it. Like big fat people.

[02:34:13.490 --> 02:34:22.430]
Yeah but Mike was you know. He just died one day. Remember that? Yep. He called us a few times

[02:34:22.430 --> 02:34:26.490]
when he was saying he was working in Palm Beach. And he called us a few times. He got screwed by

[02:34:26.490 --> 02:34:31.550]
Cox Broadcasting. Although they didn't have to pay him off for not working for you. That was good.

[02:34:31.650 --> 02:34:36.710]
Nice going Mike. And all this crap about Oh Winery hated you. Yeah you should live so long.

[02:34:37.370 --> 02:34:41.750]
All these Desperado jealous wannabes out there with your stupid. And you know one good thing

[02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:45.430]
that's happening the last part of the show. They got all that chazarey out of the way. And the

[02:34:46.010 --> 02:34:51.630]
first hour of the show when I was having my bowel episodes and then they all vanished for the day.

[02:34:52.910 --> 02:34:58.650]
So thank you so very much for giving us a little a little relief. A little chronic relief. Yes.

[02:34:59.650 --> 02:35:06.470]
The day was up 14 points. A little tiny bit of relief from the chronic. We need some chronic

[02:35:06.470 --> 02:35:13.810]
chronic. This is the most disgusting program. I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[02:35:14.590 --> 02:35:18.990]
RJ Intendola that was the city manager as planned. And he's going back in the day.

[02:35:18.990 --> 02:35:22.450]
Advertisement. We didn't miss much.

[02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:24.650]
As calm.

[02:35:49.630 --> 02:35:49.790]
Yes.

[02:35:50.990 --> 02:35:53.490]
Just waiting for the early bus.

[02:36:00.110 --> 02:36:01.950]
Wasting waking.

[02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:12.310]
Searching for the false teeth. They left in a glass.

[02:36:12.310 --> 02:36:12.510]
Yes.

[02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:24.490]
And how did they claim that there's a talk host to play. But they know.

[02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:28.510]
Is their own damn part.

[02:36:38.890 --> 02:36:39.850]
The

[02:36:39.850 --> 02:36:41.470]
the shower in my.

[02:36:43.370 --> 02:36:45.630]
To get the early but out time.

[02:36:47.970 --> 02:36:51.530]
And wasn't just as hard as it came.

[02:36:56.030 --> 02:36:57.790]
And once they are seated.

[02:36:58.510 --> 02:36:58.570]
Yeah.

[02:37:00.190 --> 02:37:02.030]
They get all the sheathed.

[02:37:03.690 --> 02:37:08.410]
And stock stuff in rows and sweeten low in their beds.

[02:37:09.070 --> 02:37:09.570]
Oi.

[02:37:12.510 --> 02:37:16.770]
Wasting away again and good old hearted.

[02:37:20.830 --> 02:37:24.690]
Looking for that long lost father of you.

[02:37:28.510 --> 02:37:34.850]
And how did they say that it's all of the truth today.

[02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:37.030]
That's a bloody for some.

[02:37:39.250 --> 02:37:40.870]
And I'm in the blue.

[02:37:41.650 --> 02:37:42.310]
Brackum.

[02:37:45.650 --> 02:37:47.790]
Your folks don't know the reason.

[02:37:49.950 --> 02:37:52.030]
But nothing is pleasing.

[02:37:52.030 --> 02:37:58.230]
And muscles ache and the teeth just don't fit.

[02:38:02.990 --> 02:38:04.450]
What doesn't matter.

[02:38:06.750 --> 02:38:09.030]
When they call up kneeling chatter.

[02:38:10.930 --> 02:38:14.630]
I hate you kneel and never listen to your.

[02:38:15.710 --> 02:38:16.390]
You fairy.

[02:38:18.670 --> 02:38:19.090]
Yes.

[02:38:19.090 --> 02:38:23.650]
And waste in a way again and good old holiday.

[02:38:27.250 --> 02:38:31.230]
Just a fox a metal musul and a radio.

[02:38:32.410 --> 02:38:33.270]
Do do do do do.

[02:38:36.450 --> 02:38:41.770]
And how they're they claim that it's a job host to play.

[02:38:42.530 --> 02:38:43.370]
But me.

[02:38:45.430 --> 02:38:46.470]
Here's the phone.

[02:38:49.550 --> 02:38:50.850]
I heard it.

[02:38:51.070 --> 02:38:52.650]
It's chirping in the back.

[02:39:01.770 --> 02:39:06.290]
They just can't wait for you.

[02:39:09.810 --> 02:39:11.250]
Those are the days man.

[02:39:11.470 --> 02:39:14.830]
Sunny Rosenberg, RG, Intendola, all the Yentas in Hellendale.

[02:39:15.730 --> 02:39:16.850]
All the old thoughts.

[02:39:18.350 --> 02:39:21.110]
In fact, somebody the same person that sent me this information.

[02:39:21.330 --> 02:39:24.790]
Send me the ancient article about that whole battle I had going out with Hellendale.

[02:39:25.350 --> 02:39:26.970]
And they were motited from diplomat mall.

[02:39:28.090 --> 02:39:29.770]
It was such a wonderful experience.

[02:39:30.050 --> 02:39:30.210]
Not.

[02:39:31.490 --> 02:39:34.110]
John ZTR, your hero and post-personal friend says.

[02:39:35.370 --> 02:39:37.830]
Neil today a caller called into Bubba, Bubba loves Bunch,

[02:39:37.950 --> 02:39:39.070]
asked him I was solo in the ratings.

[02:39:39.510 --> 02:39:41.410]
Bubba said something about the sponge effect.

[02:39:42.470 --> 02:39:44.930]
Hey, baby, just wait till the sponge effect starts to happen.

[02:39:45.050 --> 02:39:48.430]
I will soak everyone else's ratings and the sponge doesn't stop until I absorb

[02:39:48.430 --> 02:39:49.290]
everyone else's audience.

[02:39:49.290 --> 02:39:52.110]
He said, oh, wow.

[02:39:52.990 --> 02:39:53.830]
The sponge.

[02:39:54.150 --> 02:39:54.730]
I see.

[02:39:55.250 --> 02:39:58.270]
At that point he went into a rant about radio and then proceeded to talk about

[02:39:58.270 --> 02:39:59.670]
Hulk Hogan and how great he is.

[02:40:01.190 --> 02:40:03.570]
Oh boy, I guess I'm not missing too much.

[02:40:04.750 --> 02:40:08.690]
And I guess neither is anybody else because we get very little input out foot nothing.

[02:40:09.930 --> 02:40:11.430]
Making tremendous impact, Bubba.

[02:40:12.190 --> 02:40:12.410]
Not.

[02:40:13.150 --> 02:40:15.350]
Well, I was just thinking about I was playing that long bit,

[02:40:15.470 --> 02:40:16.950]
four minutes and four seconds, by the way.

[02:40:17.710 --> 02:40:18.070]
Yeah.

[02:40:18.370 --> 02:40:19.290]
Of back in those days.

[02:40:19.610 --> 02:40:22.030]
Back when I made a difference, back when Michio had an impact,

[02:40:22.210 --> 02:40:25.330]
back when we were like a contender was the talk of the town.

[02:40:25.550 --> 02:40:28.050]
Of course, it helps to be on a station with a signal that somebody can hear, you know.

[02:40:28.410 --> 02:40:28.830]
That helps.

[02:40:32.810 --> 02:40:33.370]
You agree?

[02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.950]
Yep.

[02:40:34.730 --> 02:40:35.530]
It helps a lot.

[02:40:35.730 --> 02:40:36.930]
And it helps a lot.

[02:40:36.930 --> 02:40:39.090]
When we get over 700 votes on a poll about soda.

[02:40:40.410 --> 02:40:42.690]
Oh, does that put a feather in my crap?

[02:40:43.270 --> 02:40:44.210]
704 votes.

[02:40:45.350 --> 02:40:48.830]
Excluding diet, excuse whatever it is, excluding coca Pepsi,

[02:40:49.010 --> 02:40:51.110]
exuding what's the best tasting soda?

[02:40:51.970 --> 02:40:54.510]
Ginger ale 100, barks root beer 91.

[02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.730]
See, this is proof.

[02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:58.270]
This is like an ice cream effect all over again.

[02:40:58.890 --> 02:41:01.010]
Ginger ale is delicious, but no taste.

[02:41:01.870 --> 02:41:02.350]
Yeah.

[02:41:03.130 --> 02:41:05.850]
As Bill Calder used to say, delicious, but no taste.

[02:41:06.430 --> 02:41:07.170]
And that's true.

[02:41:07.650 --> 02:41:08.370]
It's refreshing.

[02:41:08.930 --> 02:41:11.450]
It's good when you're sick, like you said, but it has no taste.

[02:41:12.090 --> 02:41:14.770]
And the poll question is, what's the best tasting soda?

[02:41:15.550 --> 02:41:15.710]
Huh.

[02:41:15.930 --> 02:41:18.090]
How can the best tasting soda be one that has no taste?

[02:41:19.950 --> 02:41:21.110]
Can you answer that for me?

[02:41:21.590 --> 02:41:21.750]
No.

[02:41:24.690 --> 02:41:25.050]
Wow.

[02:41:26.510 --> 02:41:27.610]
I'll save this for tomorrow.

[02:41:27.730 --> 02:41:29.370]
In fact, this will kill maybe the whole hour and a half

[02:41:29.370 --> 02:41:30.450]
you for the basketball game tomorrow.

[02:41:30.850 --> 02:41:32.910]
This thing about for weeks now, it's Benito Rogers,

[02:41:33.230 --> 02:41:35.710]
one of South Florida's most popular and vitriolic video talk shows.

[02:41:35.710 --> 02:41:37.430]
Versus the old people of Halendale.

[02:41:38.250 --> 02:41:40.610]
And now I'm an old fart myself and I still can't stand them.

[02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:41.410]
How do you like that?

[02:41:42.730 --> 02:41:45.210]
And like I predicted back then, if I live long enough,

[02:41:45.330 --> 02:41:46.830]
which I did to become a senior citizen,

[02:41:47.010 --> 02:41:48.310]
I'm never going to behave like that.

[02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:51.090]
I'm never going to steal a silverware, steal a sweet and low,

[02:41:52.690 --> 02:41:54.730]
go to the early bird dinners, be a snore,

[02:41:54.930 --> 02:41:56.650]
and even during these tough economic times,

[02:41:59.110 --> 02:42:02.190]
Judy says, I couldn't call, but wanted to wish you a happy

[02:42:02.190 --> 02:42:05.070]
poor, midday late from the great niece of the thanks for calling, Lady.

[02:42:05.070 --> 02:42:05.850]
How do you like that?

[02:42:06.190 --> 02:42:06.510]
Wow.

[02:42:06.690 --> 02:42:08.950]
The great niece of the thanks for calling, Lady.

[02:42:09.310 --> 02:42:10.350]
Well, that's great she were here.

[02:42:10.570 --> 02:42:12.310]
If she were here, she would say,

[02:42:12.310 --> 02:42:13.410]
happy for him.

[02:42:13.610 --> 02:42:14.170]
But she's not.

[02:42:14.570 --> 02:42:15.370]
But not nice, Judy.

[02:42:15.550 --> 02:42:16.070]
Thank you, Judy.

[02:42:16.950 --> 02:42:17.910]
Oh, and I got a dead guy.

[02:42:17.910 --> 02:42:19.770]
We usually do the dead people in the beginning of the show.

[02:42:21.270 --> 02:42:22.910]
And it's somebody nobody ever heard of.

[02:42:25.090 --> 02:42:25.810]
Larry Regan.

[02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.730]
It's a hockey name.

[02:42:27.730 --> 02:42:28.470]
You know, you're hockey?

[02:42:29.270 --> 02:42:29.730]
No, I don't.

[02:42:30.310 --> 02:42:32.110]
King's coach in general manager, Larry Regan.

[02:42:32.110 --> 02:42:33.770]
He played for at least a hundred years ago.

[02:42:35.070 --> 02:42:37.990]
He was the King's GM when the team entered the NHL in 1967,

[02:42:38.430 --> 02:42:40.770]
built some respectable teams despite owner Jack Kent Cook's

[02:42:40.770 --> 02:42:43.690]
insistence that he trade first around draft breaks for established players,

[02:42:44.150 --> 02:42:47.050]
died Monday in a hospital out of why he was 78.

[02:42:48.330 --> 02:42:50.490]
He also coached the Kings for the 7071 season.

[02:42:50.570 --> 02:42:51.870]
He really part of the following season.

[02:42:52.010 --> 02:42:55.010]
He'd been suffering from Parkinson's disease, other elements, and now he's dead.

[02:42:56.090 --> 02:42:58.370]
In the expansion draft that brought the Kings into the NHL,

[02:42:58.610 --> 02:43:01.330]
he claimed players such as cowboy Bill flat Ted Irvine,

[02:43:01.750 --> 02:43:04.050]
Eddie Joyelle and Rayal Lemieux, the Mew.

[02:43:04.050 --> 02:43:07.370]
In what was then called the amateur draft, he had it mainstays such as

[02:43:07.370 --> 02:43:10.990]
Bush Gurring, Billy Smith, Dick Van Aske, and the Ned Kamadowski.

[02:43:14.050 --> 02:43:15.270]
Well, he's dead.

[02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:16.310]
Larry Regan.

[02:43:17.890 --> 02:43:19.410]
He played for at least for about five minutes.

[02:43:19.630 --> 02:43:20.030]
Aren't you impressed?

[02:43:20.350 --> 02:43:21.190]
Leafs one last night.

[02:43:22.070 --> 02:43:22.670]
No, O.T.

[02:43:23.130 --> 02:43:23.470]
O.T.

[02:43:24.590 --> 02:43:25.650]
Pants has lost chewed out.

[02:43:26.410 --> 02:43:29.370]
They had 700 penalties called against him and they lost in a chewed out.

[02:43:30.970 --> 02:43:31.630]
Aren't you depressed?

[02:43:32.090 --> 02:43:32.190]
No.

[02:43:32.750 --> 02:43:33.890]
We loved the pants.

[02:43:33.950 --> 02:43:36.450]
There's let's get hockey intensive tomorrow before that big basketball game.

[02:43:37.970 --> 02:43:41.990]
Or maybe we'll read the beast down to do a whole hour and a half lead into the game.

[02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:45.290]
Okay, now let me ask you a stupid question.

[02:43:45.450 --> 02:43:47.790]
Do we miss a spot in that set or what?

[02:43:48.210 --> 02:43:49.090]
I didn't take it out.

[02:43:49.250 --> 02:43:50.170]
No, I can't back it up.

[02:43:52.790 --> 02:43:55.070]
Because I did the break the same time I always do 53.

[02:43:55.090 --> 02:43:56.510]
He's supposed to be a four minute break, right?

[02:43:58.010 --> 02:43:58.930]
Well, I didn't miss one.

[02:44:00.050 --> 02:44:00.790]
You didn't miss one.

[02:44:00.910 --> 02:44:01.070]
What?

[02:44:01.350 --> 02:44:02.010]
I didn't miss a spot.

[02:44:02.030 --> 02:44:03.910]
It might have been taken out while I wasn't looking.

[02:44:04.230 --> 02:44:05.250]
Oh my god.

[02:44:05.470 --> 02:44:06.530]
And so we got like a minute left over.

[02:44:06.630 --> 02:44:08.570]
I don't want to come up short or sand.

[02:44:08.790 --> 02:44:10.170]
With just your stick in your hand.

[02:44:10.870 --> 02:44:11.430]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:44:11.490 --> 02:44:15.750]
I don't want to come out of that crap room with just my stick in my hand.

[02:44:15.770 --> 02:44:19.550]
I wanted them old-fashioned toilets with a ball and chain thing.

[02:44:19.630 --> 02:44:20.870]
Yeah, it's perfect for us.

[02:44:22.050 --> 02:44:24.570]
I bet you said that guys, we all happy that we're doing godfather stuff.

[02:44:24.890 --> 02:44:26.810]
Yeah, it's dead.

[02:44:27.730 --> 02:44:27.770]
Sorry.

[02:44:27.770 --> 02:44:30.230]
Sorry for us that we got somebody screwed up.

[02:44:58.090 --> 02:45:02.090]
The human that sparks out will be human.

[02:45:02.390 --> 02:45:05.450]
There's no doubt it will have your face.

[02:45:05.690 --> 02:45:08.330]
It can take your place and what the Pope says does.

[02:45:08.570 --> 02:45:11.810]
And might have just got to be Tritish.

[02:45:12.150 --> 02:45:15.170]
Make a wish and never maybe.

[02:45:15.570 --> 02:45:20.790]
We look like you but more brand new and have ten fingers maybe.

[02:45:21.230 --> 02:45:23.330]
When you look into it's eyes.

[02:45:23.910 --> 02:45:25.670]
You're bound to recognize.

[02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:27.990]
It's not again.

[02:45:28.390 --> 02:45:29.870]
I'm naturally.

[02:45:32.390 --> 02:45:39.570]
It seems to me that just one of me alone in the world is all this one dead.

[02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:42.310]
It won't be one dead.

[02:45:42.910 --> 02:45:44.390]
We don't need to.

[02:45:45.510 --> 02:45:47.470]
We don't need to.

[02:45:49.250 --> 02:45:51.710]
And if you wait a few more years.

[02:45:52.230 --> 02:45:54.390]
You'll be drinking all of your beers.

[02:45:54.390 --> 02:45:57.810]
You might take a ride on your brand new ride.

[02:45:58.130 --> 02:46:00.150]
Realizing your worst fears.

[02:46:00.530 --> 02:46:02.650]
Because when you're old and weak.

[02:46:03.510 --> 02:46:05.290]
There's still be addicts.

[02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:07.450]
Grab you by the neck.

[02:46:07.770 --> 02:46:08.770]
Passion on your chest.

[02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:11.970]
Making you onto the asphalt.

[02:46:12.310 --> 02:46:15.070]
And you have the same DNA.

[02:46:15.530 --> 02:46:17.390]
Be it your own fault.

[02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:20.170]
Let's hope that science has the sense

[02:46:20.170 --> 02:46:23.150]
to bring it on to a fault.

[02:46:23.150 --> 02:46:25.070]
You're pulling fast away.

[02:46:25.350 --> 02:46:26.050]
Toto, tooto, tooto.

[02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:29.950]
Give you DNA to clone again.

[02:46:30.250 --> 02:46:31.930]
I'm tired of a hair naturally.

[02:46:34.010 --> 02:46:35.810]
I'm clone again.

[02:46:37.670 --> 02:46:38.390]
Unnaturally.

[02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:41.130]
Bye, bye, bye.
