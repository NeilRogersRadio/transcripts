[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]
Now the Neil Rogers show on 560 WQAM.

[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.820]
It's Friday you bastards.

[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.620]
Right now on Intergame of tonight.

[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.960]
Air travel plans gone badly wrong.

[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.760]
The woman who was just told she had missed her flight

[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.360]
from Hong Kong to San Francisco.

[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.660]
And here with the English translation is Christian Bell.

[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.440]
Take your fucking ass.

[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.980]
No, no, don't shut me up.

[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.400]
The three minute tirade is a rapidly coming

[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.600]
a YouTube sensation.

[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.620]
I can't wait to see that.

[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.740]
Tiny mon crazy to tiny one lady.

[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.940]
Well, it's 10 o'clock at 560 WQAM.

[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.320]
We got the beast in the studio.

[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.680]
Yeah, very low level.

[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.900]
But.

[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.740]
OK, there you go.

[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.360]
That's more like it.

[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.720]
Don't don't pay any attention to step

[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.540]
for any of these engineers.

[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.500]
OK, you're sitting there looking right at the VU.

[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.800]
You have some idea.

[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.320]
I mean, even you've got an idea.

[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.020]
Before that need a lot of be going like in your back.

[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.420]
Don't ask and George is out of costume.

[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.120]
Whoo.

[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.800]
Where they're playing a lot of loud music in the background.

[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.380]
Yeah, they are.

[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.100]
Why?

[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.440]
I don't know if they haven't before.

[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.860]
Well, I don't there's nobody here to like us right now.

[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.320]
I mean, we're this time.

[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.920]
Don't like us.

[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.620]
Apparently not.

[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.020]
You sound like you got a bad head cold or something.

[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.880]
Yeah, a little bit of a I don't know if it's a melody

[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.160]
or something a little stuffy.

[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.300]
Do you know stuffy?

[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.800]
Steffy and stuffy out.

[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.260]
And always on stuffy on this headset microphone.

[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.880]
I don't know why this is bad.

[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.400]
Then it's how bad these parable sounds bad in my.

[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.160]
Sounds like crap.

[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.360]
I should just go play the slots.

[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.840]
Yeah, that's a good idea.

[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.740]
Go play some slots.

[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.540]
Find a good machine.

[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.860]
Mon.

[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.020]
I don't want to get two slots intensive.

[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.340]
It's a lot of water cash.

[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.340]
So let's see how much we can lose today.

[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.700]
Well, I don't want to read these emails

[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.900]
because George doesn't like it.

[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.980]
George wants the calls.

[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.540]
Go whatever.

[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.200]
I'm going to do whatever the hell I want to do.

[00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.820]
How do you like that?

[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.780]
No kidding.

[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.520]
You heard it beast.

[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.000]
He's giving me a lecture about how the calls are so entertaining

[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.020]
in the reading.

[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.520]
Yeah, that's what I said.

[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.640]
Reading whatever we have causes.

[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.820]
Reading chat boards.

[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.040]
All the chat rooms on their chat room.

[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.020]
These aren't on your chat rooms.

[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.980]
These are our people.

[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.960]
Don't you want to do that?

[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.340]
Oh, yeah, sure.

[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.960]
Yeah, they are our people.

[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.580]
You can have them.

[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.560]
I want to take credit for them, but there's our people.

[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.980]
Now we got Morris is our contestant today.

[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.940]
Not Morris the cat, but Morris somebody.

[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.700]
Morris off to Laughan.

[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.280]
Our ratio.

[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.580]
I wonder if the beast knows what that means off to Laughan.

[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.240]
I've heard of Obsilakis before.

[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.740]
No, no, that's not right.

[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.080]
Obsilakis.

[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.040]
What what the hell is that?

[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.760]
We use that a lot.

[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.860]
Who's what does it mean?

[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.300]
It's like my luck.

[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.260]
Like I can't believe that I just my luck.

[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.640]
Yeah.

[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.740]
That was one of the 85 definitions somebody emailed in.

[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.940]
Yeah.

[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.320]
Well, there's, you know, in Yiddish,

[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.500]
there's seven billion different pronunciations for things.

[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.980]
Yeah.

[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.280]
So how's things out of Gulfstream, George?

[00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.940]
Well, there's nobody here yet.

[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.940]
I mean, there's a couple of people running around.

[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.040]
Well, I mean, there's 10 o'clock.

[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.260]
Fundals start yet.

[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.820]
So around a bunch of times.

[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.900]
Probably better.

[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.440]
I'd be there.

[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.300]
Plunge of my guts out if I was down there right now.

[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.600]
I'd be right there finding a good machine.

[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.900]
How's wrong with you?

[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.360]
John and four Lauderdale's got to

[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.860]
bust some radio spy reports to start this morning.

[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.420]
That exciting.

[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.360]
I can't wait.

[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.660]
And well, I can Ed Berliner was filling in for a city

[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.780]
frozen Rosen, Schmuck this morning on the ticket.

[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.000]
And your close personal friend,

[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.600]
Smeg Green was on for now, which

[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.660]
you may civilized this morning,

[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.780]
assisting with financial advice.

[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.540]
Smeg Green, she's still running around peddling her crap.

[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.780]
Body like GT global Europe or whatever.

[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.740]
She's peddling.

[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.460]
Nice Panthers win last night.

[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.280]
Says John ranges ranges ranges.

[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.800]
They have the ranges.

[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.980]
They're consistent.

[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.720]
They may not be good now, but they're consistent.

[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.360]
They lose every day three times this week,

[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.740]
twice to the Leafs and once to the Panthers.

[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.680]
Ranges.

[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.640]
Well, you obnoxious New Yorkers with your ranges, man.

[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.760]
You can take them and stick them

[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.240]
well in the subway with Bernie Gets.

[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.520]
Stick them where the moon don't shine.

[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.100]
Ranges.

[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.840]
John Tortellini ate the turn of things around.

[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.920]
He said he don't even know the names of most of the players.

[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.960]
It's a good thing they got the names on the backs of the sweaters.

[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.140]
He don't even know who the LAR means is.

[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.220]
So thanks, John, for a lot of the time.

[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.900]
For the spy report.

[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.300]
And by the way, Ed burliners just.

[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.520]
It doesn't get much worse than that.

[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.980]
All the water.

[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.140]
It does wait a minute.

[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.360]
Wait until you hear the great news at the beast assured with me.

[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.000]
Okay, first I read it in very Jackass column and then beast verified it

[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.980]
because he worked across the street and got candle with air.

[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.960]
Kevin Rogers is going to do some film work for us here at Q.A.M.

[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.520]
Of course.

[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.440]
He failed over there.

[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.960]
So let's bring him over here and see if he can.

[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.040]
Of course.

[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.520]
He says he's a nice guy but horrible on the air.

[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.180]
Is that what you said?

[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.740]
A wall of hell.

[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.900]
He's very sports nerdish.

[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.940]
Was that something that's not a novelty?

[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.760]
Is that something unusual here?

[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.360]
And I met him last week.

[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.840]
He was here.

[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.200]
He came out after me.

[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.820]
He just he showed up four hours early and paced around the entire building.

[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.560]
Just was pacing for hours.

[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.360]
Well, so he's not ready been on the air.

[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.160]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.960]
Our air.

[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.080]
He didn't get a lot of commentary about that.

[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.140]
I didn't get I think I got one email about that.

[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.880]
He hasn't made much of an impact just like Bob.

[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.200]
I'd love a dork.

[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.820]
Have you heard his show?

[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.920]
He's talking to you these.

[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.700]
Oh, no, I know.

[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.820]
You haven't?

[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.080]
No.

[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.680]
Because I sure am not getting a lot of commentary about him.

[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.360]
Other than the fact he mentions my name a lot.

[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.920]
I don't I don't tune into terrestrial radio much.

[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.040]
Really?

[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.560]
Well, excuse us.

[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.380]
So you're a satellite person?

[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.980]
I am.

[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.100]
Oh, God.

[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.060]
Space cadet.

[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.660]
Don't tell me you're listening to Howard.

[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.880]
No, hell no.

[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.040]
Well, why not?

[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.800]
Because I hate Howard.

[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.200]
You hate Howard's sperm?

[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.820]
Yeah, I heard the same crap 15 years ago.

[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.200]
Anything else, Robin?

[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.100]
Anything else?

[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.840]
Somebody died, by the way, celebrity death.

[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.120]
Maybe you guys know who this is because I sure don't.

[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.360]
Really?

[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.800]
Pylon guitarist Randy Buley.

[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.540]
What group?

[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.020]
A co-founder of the Influential Athens Act.

[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.420]
Who?

[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.280]
Pylon?

[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.820]
Pylon guitarist Randy Buley.

[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.880]
Don't ask me what that means.

[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.660]
I have no idea.

[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.680]
Wow.

[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.620]
He died Wednesday at Athens Hospital after something a heart attack behind the wheel

[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.120]
Monday night.

[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.040]
It was 53.

[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.820]
Everybody hears shake in their head.

[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.780]
Buley died about 5 p.m. Wednesday at Athens Regional Medical Center where he was at this

[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.000]
is a must be Athens, Georgia.

[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.680]
It's not Athens, Greece.

[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.160]
Athens, Georgia.

[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.360]
We're supposed to know what that is.

[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.600]
So this is from the Atlanta urinal constitution.

[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.640]
A box newspaper, by the way, so you know it's a piece of crap, a rag.

[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.100]
Bob Neal should only die a wicked, awful, horrible death.

[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.080]
Buley died about 5 p.m. Wednesday at Athens Regional Medical Center where he was admitted

[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.520]
after he flipped his van on Barber Street early Monday night.

[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.820]
And it's got a picture of me.

[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.880]
He was ugly and he's dead.

[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.220]
Randy Buley.

[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.280]
So nobody ever heard of him, right?

[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.660]
Nope.

[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:13.080]
No.

[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.200]
But it killed about a minute, though.

[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.780]
That's good.

[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.760]
Oh, I see.

[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.120]
Goes on here.

[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.060]
There's a whole page.

[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.580]
Really?

[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.660]
B-52's frontman, Fred Schneider told the Atlanta Journal Constitution Wednesday.

[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.640]
I'm a complete shock.

[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.880]
To me, Pylon was the best bandwere come out of Athens and still is.

[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.840]
We never heard of it.

[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.220]
No.

[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.960]
It's a Georgia thing, I guess.

[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.480]
Pylon.

[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:32.920]
Wow.

[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.520]
He went inside the pylons.

[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.660]
That's a harness racing thing.

[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.180]
Wow.

[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.620]
And it goes on a third page.

[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.040]
Holy.

[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.240]

[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.580]
I could have killed a whole first segment here with this.

[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.580]
If I would have been smart, which I'm not.

[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.720]
So we got the beast today because, um, Plee is out there with you.

[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.520]
Don't ask me why.

[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.920]
Because he's the promotion guy.

[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.660]
This is a promotion.

[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.580]
Oh, get out.

[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.740]
Here's the promotions guy.

[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.820]
What is he doing out there?

[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.840]
What is he doing out there?

[00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.320]
I'm trying to tell you.

[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.420]
And I'm not listening.

[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:00.960]
OK.

[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.040]
What is he doing?

[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:02.980]
Got it.

[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.480]
Do you think all this stuff sets itself up the table with the table cloth and all the

[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:09.600]
better?

[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.600]
That's really how you do that.

[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.100]
Don't we have flunkies for that?

[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.760]
Don't give them any.

[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.380]
You know, we have some flunkies to do that.

[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.460]
And the important guy like Lee, who a beast tells me is taken over his PD pretty soon.

[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:20.760]
Any day now.

[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.900]
He's taking every day.

[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.960]
They said the current's just resigned a new deal.

[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.200]
To understand that soon, there's only going to be one way though.

[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.480]
I'm trying to give you some important inside dope and you're like just bad on the

[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.420]
setting up tables and stupid crap.

[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.600]
Who cares about that?

[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.900]
We don't care about setting up a bunch of stupid ass tables.

[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.760]
A bunch of kids could come out there and do that.

[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.140]
They do.

[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.060]
But all those punks that run around the building, what are they doing?

[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.920]
They they huff jobs.

[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.780]
So Kevin Rogers wandered around the building for four hours.

[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.320]
Why don't you guess maybe he's gotten to have much else going on, you know, maybe he was

[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:53.600]
nervous.

[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.240]
Just kept pacing and pacing.

[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.900]
Well, obviously he was nervous.

[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.140]
Okay, he was going to be on like an almost what used to be a real radio station.

[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.940]
As opposed to across the street, laughing stock, a joke.

[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.280]
Oh, but we get 40 trillion hits on the George Sedano.

[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.360]
Oh, I'll pull you out great.

[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.100]
That's their claim to fame is how many votes they get on the pool.

[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.420]
I mean, that's that's sad.

[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.000]
The now is down 85, by the way, speaking of numbers.

[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.160]
Let's take a look at our pool.

[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.440]
An honor of black history month, what late grade black entertainer you a mistomost.

[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.360]
I'm not going to read that whole pseudo intellectual crap that Charlie B is got.

[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.860]
697 votes.

[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.020]
That's not too bad for us.

[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.020]
Sorry, we can't match up, Paul Jorge.

[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.900]
Not you, Jorge, the other one.

[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:37.420]
No, I know.

[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.380]
Maybe one day.

[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.560]
The guy over there with his one 1.9 share Jimmy Henry 133.

[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.480]
By the way, next Thursday, the trends coming out beast.

[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.020]
Ooh.

[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.420]
We'll see if the Joe Rocho continues to falter because of those horrible guests that

[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.980]
Zach keeps putting on there.

[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:54.740]
Don't wait.

[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.580]
You can relate to what you used to do with tomorrow.

[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.220]
And now Zach's doing it to Joe, but it's not Zach.

[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.240]
And that's nothing to do with it.

[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.380]
I keep trying to tell him that there is one here.

[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.020]
It comes from the top.

[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.900]
I keep trying to tell him that from the top as in Joe or from your boyfriend.

[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.500]
Clarence.

[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.880]
I don't think Jerry is booking guests.

[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.020]
Jerry's.

[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.100]
Well, then Son of the Rosentine.

[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.640]
Clarence is foisting these people on him.

[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.220]
And are they still getting paid by the way?

[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.720]
While everybody else is taking a pay cut?

[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.460]
Jerry's.

[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.440]
I don't know.

[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.740]
Are they still getting paid through Rosentine crants and Alex Marvazness,

[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.340]
much of losers and Ira Windbag?

[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.740]
I'm sure they don't do it for free.

[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:28.840]
Oh, listen.

[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:29.300]
God.

[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.760]
While people are taking a pay cut and they're paying these losers to come on and destroy

[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.220]
the ratings.

[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:34.580]
Nice.

[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.780]

I voted for Marvin Gaye.

[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.000]
But then you know me.

[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.200]
Notorious.

[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.000]
B.I.G.

[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.740]
You've got to be kidding me.

[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.660]

You don't know what that means, shicker?

[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:29.700]
Drunk.

[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.000]
In either shicker is drunk.

[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.760]

[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.500]
Dorothy Daedrich 1.

[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.580]
None for Nina Simone, Josephine Baker, Sarah Vaughan, or

[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.820]
Hattie McDaniel.

[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:42.520]
Who?

[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.300]
It's 5-12 Friday, you bastards.

[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.580]
The federal government just lowering the government

[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.640]
about those people today.

[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.880]
Underwittering criticism from both parties, Brown offered no apology.

[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.180]
And mostly, Greg Ozzard, put a department that crossed hundreds of lines.

[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.060]
Mike Brown.

[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.380]
There's no one left to blame.

[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.800]
I said Brownie.

[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.160]
You're the government shame.

[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.060]
I said Brownie.

[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.060]
Your career's up and blamed.

[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.140]
There's no one.

[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.440]
I know who's more lame.

[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.120]
George Bush.

[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.940]
You better make him shut up before he says.

[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.280]
It was you who messed up.

[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.140]
You can defend him.

[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:28.640]
But I'm sure you will find many things that he should do time.

[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.700]
I was a very miserable.

[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.420]
These ways you've come to run the FBMA.

[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.420]
Some people died when he ran FPMMA.

[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.060]
Now that everyone knows that your leadership flows,

[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.000]
you can go back to your horror shows.

[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:51.400]
Today, most Republicans and Democrats criticize the fact that Brown is still on the federal payroll.

[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.900]
That may be because as long as he remains an administration official,

[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.780]
his testimony must be cleared by the White House.

[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.000]
There's a lot of stuff just pouring in here this morning,

[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.800]
even though George hates these if he emails.

[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.360]
I'll put it yesterday and never knew that all along.

[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.500]
I thought everything was going well and then George finally blurt out,

[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.440]
oh this is like a chat room reading a chat room.

[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.340]
I figured it would run its course like a lot of things do.

[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.240]
I figured it would run its course like a lot of things do with the novelty war.

[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.240]
What does that mean?

[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.980]
I'll come and stand cooks not on a list.

[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.260]
Adam, Adam to it or Bob Marley or Bob Marley.

[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.760]
Bob Marley's not on a list.

[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.760]
Bob Marley's not on a list. He'll zoom to the top.

[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.820]
Get out of here. Bob Marley's not on a list.

[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.120]
Who made that list? Charlie B. What a loser.

[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.400]
How could you leave Bob Marley off a list, man?

[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.960]
God. He puts what the hell?

[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.840]
Dorothy Danridge or somebody on there?

[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.000]
People nobody ever heard of.

[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.220]
Come on, Sam Cook and now no Bob Marley.

[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.460]
Didn't she win the first Oscar or something?

[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.400]
First Black Lady?

[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.960]
Dorothy Danridge?

[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.980]
Like I would know that?

[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.280]
You're the old timer.

[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.940]
Happened to the olden days.

[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.160]
The Nathan Fles reminds us about Sam Cook.

[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:06.800]
Thank you, Bob.

[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.980]
Well, as Frity said, when you're going to have somebody at Bob Marley and Sam Cook,

[00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.740]
that's embarrassing Charlie B.

[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.960]
Hey Charlie, retire.

[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.240]
Now, my adding or is Eric adding?

[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:19.580]
Your end?

[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.080]
Your end?

[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.560]
No, I have to figure out how to drafts.

[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.240]
Ex Bulls broadcaster coach Johnny Red Curr dies.

[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.300]
I remember Red Curr.

[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.280]
He played for the Syracuse Nats.

[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.040]
Doll Shays, Red Curr, Johnny Curr.

[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.820]
100 years ago, Syracuse Nationals.

[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.380]
Can you believe that Syracuse had a team in the NBA?

[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:43.680]
I did.

[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.140]
At least?

[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.040]
Yeah.

[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.420]
Did you know that?

[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.340]
I did know that.

[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.400]
Syracuse Nats.

[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.580]
And Johnny Curr is dead.

[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.120]
I don't know how old he was because it doesn't...

[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.880]
Well, it's gonna mean he's a link.

[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.180]
I don't do links.

[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:57.980]
Sorry.

[00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.920]
That he links fossil.

[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:01.400]
No links.

[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.060]
I do like links.

[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.200]
No, not all that much.

[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.060]
No?

[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.760]
What about doing the old Mike Rineria bit?

[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.660]
Yabba-Dabba-Doo.

[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.460]
What does that mean?

[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.080]
I came to it.

[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.580]
What about doing the old Mike Rineria bit?

[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.400]
What does that mean?

[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:12.940]
I have no idea.

[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.220]
What Mike Rineria bit?

[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.600]
Uga-Buga?

[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.320]
I think that's what that means.

[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.040]
Yabba-Dabba-Doo.

[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.480]
That's the stupid bunch of crap.

[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.180]
Okay, let's get to the important things.

[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.480]
Now, did you add Bob Marley?

[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.580]
Working on it.

[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.880]
How could Bob Marley not be on there?

[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.520]
Charlie B.

[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.160]
What is wrong with you, man?

[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.600]
Talk about embarrassing and humiliating and degrading.

[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.040]
Jesus.

[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.420]
New York City Dave, who really gets how my nerves big time.

[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.120]
George is right about most of these idiots.

[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.300]
That's the same people over and over and over and over again.

[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.080]
That's okay.

[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.120]
Kill some good time.

[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:46.760]
I'm enjoying it.

[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.940]
I don't have to take those stupid calls.

[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:48.980]
I'm your friend.

[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.580]
You say Mr. Calls, though.

[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:51.380]
Who does?

[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.240]
He likes the calls.

[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:52.880]
Beast.

[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.360]
Oh, they add a ton to the show.

[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:55.000]
Yeah.

[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.380]
A ton of what?

[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:57.180]
Crap.

[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.220]
New York City Dave says, can you add J-Matt and J-Matt and J-Mastro J of Rundee?

[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:03.820]
Have you seen the pull?

[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:04.300]
No.

[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:06.980]
Innovative.

[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.120]
Why not?

[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.220]
Also, where is Wayne Arnold's restaurant exactly located?

[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.740]
It's in a neighborhood where you don't want to go.

[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:13.920]
Yeah, you do.

[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.440]
In the daytime.

[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.820]
125th Street and Northwest 7th Avenue, 441.

[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.000]
Bring a flashlight.

[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.120]
I'll be in South Florida and May.

[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.180]
What are you laughing about?

[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.120]
It's not a good neighborhood.

[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.080]
Wayne would admit that.

[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.560]
Look, it's like where vampires are.

[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.760]
As long as you go there and the day before.

[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.460]
Where's the risk you're going to live to go there and believe me,

[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:31.280]
if you go there, you will.

[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.420]
I'll be in South Florida and May.

[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.260]
I want to check it out in the restaurant, too,

[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.000]
says New York City Dave, who's a real panic.

[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.000]
In closing, I don't think the range is good-score.

[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.640]
And ladies, prison with a fistful of pardons.

[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.240]
Your favorite chronic in New York City.

[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.960]
You're not our favorite anything, New York City.

[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:44.580]
Dave, you're annoying.

[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:45.740]
Who's friend is he?

[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.720]
He's somebody's a buddy.

[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:47.920]
I don't know.

[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.360]
I think Zisco's buddy.

[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.800]
Zisco, who also has become annoying.

[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.840]
Used to be good and now he turned to be a real jerk.

[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.940]
Oh, the fake Mark Hockman.

[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.940]
Now, do you know the real Mark Hockman across the street?

[00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.780]
I know of him very well.

[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.660]
I've never met him.

[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.440]
But I know he will.

[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.700]
A lot of people that know him.

[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.880]
What does it mean to know of him very well?

[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.920]
In other words, I know about 10 people that know him.

[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.780]
But I've never met him.

[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.480]
Well, the fake Mark Hockman writes,

[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.700]
we had 2,000 people show up Wednesday night and day,

[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.340]
and you'd see Luther Campbell waxes you into Stugots' chest.

[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:20.060]
That's more listeners you ever had at your peak, jealous yet?

[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.860]
Or more listeners than we ever had at our peak, 2,000, yeah?

[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.180]
Well, we haven't peaked yet, see.

[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.760]
What a joke.

[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.520]
And like I said, these people keep trying to talk themselves into it.

[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.500]
You haven't got squat, okay?

[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.080]
And talk about childish and soft amoric waxing you into Stugots' chest.

[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.220]
Oh, brother.

[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.220]
How about waxing a Z into his chest?

[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.760]
In fact, we'll give you Joseph Gackie for the Z part.

[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.760]
Even the beast knows Joseph Gackie,

[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.060]
don't belong on here even to say hello.

[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:45.940]
Even you know that.

[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.320]
He just doesn't want to say it.

[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.440]
Oh, my God.

[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.020]
Oh, my God.

[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:51.480]
You talking to me?

[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:52.800]
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.840]
Joseph Gackie sucks.

[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.520]
With that fake excitement, my God.

[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.160]
There's nothing worse than a guy with no personality trying to sound excited.

[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.640]
Last night on the have a show on the NHL network called Voices.

[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.280]
By the way, to leave, so one again, they had blue bleed

[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.560]
and then shoot out.

[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.220]
They beat the islanders, three in a row for to make the leaves.

[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.680]
And the Panthers beat the arrangers who lose every day.

[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.800]
Ranges, ranges, ranges suck.

[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.760]
Even with John Twartolini.

[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.900]
Now, what was I just about to say something very important?

[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:24.820]
I don't know.

[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.520]
I was hanging on the air.

[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.580]
It was very important.

[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.860]
You're not going to get provoked.

[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.800]
Well, I'm old and feeble.

[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.880]
And you'll be pleased to know my fingers coming along good.

[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:32.500]
Oh, good.

[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.800]
Actually, I was actually thinking about that this morning,

[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.880]
as I was smearing Neutrogena on my face.

[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.660]
I'm using Neutrogena, man.

[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:39.760]
It looked a lot better.

[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:40.780]
It's a wonderful thing.

[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.660]
It's a bad dry skin thing, you know?

[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.100]
Probably from winter.

[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:45.020]
Winter skin.

[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.420]
From a very dry winter.

[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.200]
Oh, boy.

[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.580]
It happens to us all.

[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.640]
I'm drying over here.

[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.320]
So first, he says,

[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.660]
did you get your tickets yet to see the Jonas Brothers 3D movie?

[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.640]
Don't forget to bring a box of good and pleasant munch on.

[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.240]
Ah, ah, ah.

[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:00.800]
Ah, ah.

[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.100]
The Jonas Brothers 3D movie.

[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.440]
There is actually such a thing.

[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.560]
Yeah, I think it's out now.

[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:07.940]
It's out now.

[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:08.300]
Yeah.

[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.600]
Also, you're glasses.

[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:15.840]
Yeah, let me get my 3D glasses and see if Joey Jonas is poking anything in my eye.

[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.040]
Oh, yeah.

[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:17.500]
Oh, geez.

[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.240]
Look at doing it again.

[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:21.260]
Wow.

[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.340]
I just wanted Joey just to poke my eye on.

[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.660]
He opened his fly and picked my eye.

[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.720]
At any rate, I'm not going to go see the Jonas Brothers.

[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.900]
And here's from the fake Tom Jicke.

[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:34.940]
See, it's really hard.

[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:39.560]
The fake Tom Jicke to get a scoop on Barry Jackass when Barry's actually a real person with the real newspaper column.

[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:45.500]
And the road to this morning in there at the ass end of it that Kevin Rogers is going to be doing some a part time work on Q.A.M.

[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.460]
The fake Tom says I had this on Monday and Barry acts like he got the scoop.

[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.340]
Well, that's because it was the real Barry putting it in the real Harold as opposed to the fake Tom Jicke.

[00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:01.540]
On Monday, February 23rd, Tom Jicke wrote, I heard that Kevin Rogers was on WQM this weekend.

[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.720]
Yeah, because you heard it whoever this faker is.

[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:08.140]
How about you, Tom Jicke is not too happy to have an imposter running around on a loose.

[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:08.980]
A trade doesn't care.

[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.440]
So Morris is our contestant today in the second race of Gulfstream.

[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.900]
Any advice from the audience, I could change my pick.

[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:15.600]
Right.

[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.980]
I picked the 11 Mr. Dr. Professor.

[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:19.340]
Right.

[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.920]
Can't you just change it right up to post time because we're all here.

[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.940]
I also have a I have a hunch on Longshot, the eighth, Ethan the monster,

[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.620]
was the great Jose Lusano significant jockey change there.

[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.320]
You have a hutch and his horses got excuses and it's last in all of its races.

[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:42.520]
What a hutch is standing in the first turn, slow start, bumped in the turn and checked at the start.

[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.060]
He's had bad rides.

[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.800]
And now he's switching to a real jockey, Jose Lusano, the eighth and he's 12 to one in the morning.

[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.520]
But I'm still sticking with the 11.

[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.360]
If the eight wins, I'm going to be parked.

[00:21:54.700 --> 00:22:00.760]
And the first race, I still have no idea why your buddy Steve Sloan gave me the chart for the first race.

[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.680]
Just because because he likes to hear you.

[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.460]
You know, because he wants to kill the show with all this horse racing stuff.

[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:08.140]
Don't you understand?

[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:08.740]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.300]
We love our friends at Gulfstream and all this other stuff.

[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.200]
And this is a fun deal.

[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.760]
But 99% of the public out there couldn't give a fine.

[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.900]
We must about horse racing.

[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:16.880]
Ask the beast.

[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.040]
Do you care about horse racing?

[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:18.720]
No.

[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.340]
Neil.

[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.960]
Maybe because he knew that I was going to be here today.

[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.820]
So he would, you know, he knew that you'd want to pick a good horse for me.

[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.600]
Why are you whispering first race? Am I whispering?

[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.560]
Yeah, you just dropped off the base layer.

[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.040]
About now.

[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:29.660]
I don't know.

[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.880]
I don't have to change anything.

[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:31.760]
Thank you, Fred chicken.

[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:33.660]
But we get there.

[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:34.800]
I got to be there.

[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.580]
My language on my print price.

[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.060]
My sandwich?

[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.460]
My sandwich in my French.

[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.700]
That's the jockey he's talking with a knowing least.

[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:41.820]
No speaking.

[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.180]
I think Neil Rogers.

[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:44.680]
Why the...

[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.680]
You bastard.

[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.520]
Well, now it's time to panic.

[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.140]
After an auguration day.

[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.560]
Bush is back in Crawford.

[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.640]
And there's no one left to blame.

[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.800]
In my break campaign promises he made a long way.

[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.460]
Hope he don't screw up everything in his first 100 days.

[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.640]
For his first 100 days.

[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.640]
Mine really suck.

[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.180]
The banks and not all makers.

[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.880]
All won a trillion bucks.

[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.940]
He's been looking for the bathroom in the White House half the day.

[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.600]
He already misses Chicago in his first 100 days.

[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.080]
His first 100 days.

[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.960]
He's got some thank you, coach.

[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.420]
To write.

[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.480]
To rescue Father Flager and Reverend Jeremiah.

[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.500]
My alright.

[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.460]
The chances are his moment long will be driving him insane.

[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.200]
If she doesn't man I'll really be amazed.

[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.840]
And his first 100 days.

[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.220]
Down and down and down.

[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.720]
Well, pick it baby.

[00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.460]
It'll heal someday.

[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:00.620]
Just keep picking it.

[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.100]
Not the way I do it.

[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.260]
So George is out there at Gulf Stream.

[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.220]
Are you going to plunge in the first race or what?

[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.420]
Yeah, that's what I was trying to tell you.

[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.940]
That's why Steve sent you both of the races for Bologna.

[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:11.380]
Bione.

[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:11.620]

[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:11.620]

[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.140]
Okay.

[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.400]
Why should I have to have the responsibility of picking you a horse in the first race?

[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.960]
Just because you know something and I don't know anything.

[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.540]
Well, if you looked at this field in the first race, six and a half for a long span,

[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.920]
I don't think I think by the half mile pole these horses will be on the ground.

[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.620]
You know more than any of us.

[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:27.960]
Good.

[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:28.540]
God.

[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.620]
And if you know nothing, that means we know much less than nothing.

[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.540]
Well, I'll tell you what.

[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.420]
What's riding the two?

[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.900]
Oh, there's Julian Lepparrou.

[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.200]
He rode our horse last week.

[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.220]
Dr. Uga Bouga.

[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.680]
And he's at the top of this reds right now.

[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.360]
Hit him again, Julian.

[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.000]
Here he comes.

[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.720]
He really kicking into gear now.

[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.260]
And what would that time of the early closing with your hot stuff?

[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:48.940]
Mr. Hot stuff, my ass.

[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.220]
Disperse with Julian Lepparrou.

[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.260]
I don't know.

[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.180]
This is just he's taking a big drop down.

[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.820]
Big drop down into a cheap flavor.

[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.060]
That's not always a good sign.

[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.540]
How long does this race?

[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.480]
Six and a half for a long.

[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.860]
I'm going with a two, the doose in the first.

[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.460]
So two and 11 could be your double.

[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.220]
Right now, how many horses in the first race?

[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.240]
Twelve.

[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.840]
Are you smitten me or what?

[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.100]
Well, there's twelve entries in the first race.

[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:17.920]
I wouldn't say horses.

[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.240]
I think that might be an exaggeration.

[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:22.680]
Okay.

[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:30.020]
I just don't like this bunch of, um, what at Walker's beach with the Carlos Marquez.

[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.360]
I brought a watercash.

[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.280]
Let's see if we can lose it.

[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.600]
The awkward at the break broke poorly.

[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.460]
Broke ninth and finish third is first start.

[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.440]
Macrame finished the second in there, but he's going to be a short price.

[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.720]
And I don't like the rail.

[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.880]
I don't know what that means.

[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:42.800]
I explain that to me.

[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.060]
I don't care whether you know what it means.

[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.440]
Oh, you know, you know, I like to name Macrame.

[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.240]
So, uh, you want to bet that one?

[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:48.480]
Yeah.

[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:48.860]
Yeah.

[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.020]
No more.

[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.100]
He's going to be the favorite short price or one of the favorites.

[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.260]
What does that mean short price?

[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:56.500]
Short price.

[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.960]
In other words, it's not going to pay very much.

[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:58.680]
Oh, okay.

[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.200]
Two dollars to get you like four sixty five twenty something like that.

[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.160]
I'm thinking, I don't know.

[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:03.640]
Okay.

[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.460]
Well, though, I know it's only ten thirty four in a morning.

[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.180]
The two is a possibility to spurs.

[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.240]
Taking a huge class drop.

[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.580]
A big drop.

[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.220]
Dispert.

[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.340]
But he keeps dropping down and he's nowhere.

[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.740]
Fail to menace, belated bid, vied three wide and weakened.

[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.720]
And yaddy, yaddy, yaddy.

[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.580]
He just, I don't know.

[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.580]
He's in for cheap now.

[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.920]
You can have him for fifteen grand.

[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.660]
You want him?

[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.220]
Yeah.

[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:33.760]
I got that ready.

[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.620]
Number ten, Walker's beach.

[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.580]
Is that the one I'm going to pick?

[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.140]
I don't know.

[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:38.960]
Let me think about it.

[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:44.280]
Let me get back to the important emails like this one from Greg Vudelle, which I'm convinced

[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.480]
is the real Greg Vudelle.

[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.640]
In other words, what he's trying desperately to tell the world is, I have no life.

[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.920]
I know you hate me, but hear me out.

[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:54.680]
What?

[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.960]
And that a good way to start.

[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.360]
Yeah, what a good way to start.

[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.960]
That's always a good way to get off on the right foot.

[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.620]
I know you hate me, but listen, listen.

[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.680]
This is the same Greg Vudelle.

[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.920]
It was given us a song to dance about going to serious.

[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.420]
It was on the verge of going out of business.

[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.280]
This is the same guy you'd want to take career advice from, who's reviled and hated by.

[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.160]
See, it's not just that I hate you, but the world hates you, Greg.

[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.980]
See, if you would say that, then we would agree with you.

[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.620]
So if you say that I hate you, it's like meaningless.

[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.400]
If Brad Beasley was smart, who else Brad Beasley?

[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.120]
He's our boss.

[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.140]
I mean, he's what?

[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.420]
He's one of the Beasley's.

[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:32.700]
Brad?

[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:33.820]
Brad, don't we have a Brad?

[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:34.580]
I don't know.

[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.460]
I think there is a Brad.

[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:36.460]
I think there is a Brad.

[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:42.780]
If Brad Beasley was smart, he would buy 790 of the ticket, combine the sports crap on one station, 560 WQAM,

[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.500]
change 790, call it, it's back to WNWS.

[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:46.260]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.320]
You could be the anchor of a new powerhouse news talk format.

[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.720]
Randy Rhodes is available to follow you through on a high profile morning talent and proof you have a great AM station.

[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:55.400]
What do you think?

[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.440]
I think you're full of crap.

[00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.980]
That's what I think you're full of crap.

[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.460]
Get a frickin' life already.

[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.500]
You can't stop trying to like muscle into my career.

[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.060]
That's all you want to do, Greg, is muscle into this show in my life.

[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.200]
Bug off.

[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.140]
I didn't like you when you were in South Florida.

[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.380]
I don't like you when you're in Alabama.

[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.500]
I can't stand you.

[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.040]
You make me sick.

[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:14.860]
Everybody hates you.

[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.360]
And this is the reason why.

[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.220]
Because you never ever stop.

[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.900]
Just like the crap would get me involved in Sirius, which is like a diamond sheer and going out of business.

[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.560]
Quit with your obsession with me.

[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.120]
I'm a fat old Jew.

[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.560]
Okay, I'm a fat old fag.

[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.080]
So quit with your, find somebody else to obsess about, Greg.

[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.500]
Somebody who cares about what you think with these stupid cockamamey ideas.

[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:47.460]
All these failures like Greg Videl trying to concoct some sort of thing that they can muscle in on.

[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.640]
Yeah, powerhouse morning talent like you, Greg.

[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.680]
Do the morning show on W just snooze.

[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.960]
You put the snooze in W snooze.

[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.940]
That's for damn sure.

[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.900]
Maybe you could bring noodles back too.

[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.240]
Hey, this goes as why am I a real jerk?

[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:01.760]
I don't know.

[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:02.880]
It's just go tell us.

[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.020]
What did I ever do?

[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.480]
I maybe send you an email once discussing something you may have spoken about already.

[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.140]
What's the big deal?

[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.820]
Quit being a surly old man at my expense.

[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:11.440]
Baaat.

[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:12.300]
Yeah, you mean me.

[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.220]
And no defending myself does make me a jerk either.

[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:14.780]
Sure it does.

[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.100]
You're a mean man.

[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.020]
Just go find a hobby.

[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:17.780]
Just go mean.

[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.420]
I'm a mean guy.

[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:19.900]
That's right.

[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.060]
So my nice go talk to somebody else.

[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:23.780]
I'm not nice.

[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.560]
I mean, you used to be such a nice boy.

[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.140]
Now I'm not.

[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:29.800]
You hear the sirens?

[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.400]
They're coming to take away Greg Videl.

[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:31.940]
I hear the music.

[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.280]
We're sure a lot of crap on here.

[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:33.660]
This one.

[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.160]
That's good.

[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.420]
Ain't that good?

[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.040]
Oh, that's right.

[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:37.880]
You know, awesome.

[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:38.180]
It's great.

[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:38.620]
Here you go.

[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:39.140]
Here's what it says.

[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.580]
You got no material just as usual.

[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.500]
Just like this email.

[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.480]
By the way, Godfather sucks.

[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.960]
Says Leo from Boyton.

[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:45.880]
Ah, haha.

[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.340]
You suck Leo.

[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:48.880]
Godfather sucks.

[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.000]
Kind of a moron would say that.

[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.380]
Probably Leo from Boyton.

[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.180]
Brandon says this would certainly be an interesting picture of the theater.

[00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.540]
500 screaming teenage girls and right in the center of the theater near Rogers.

[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.020]
Talk about the 3D Jonas brothers.

[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.740]
Wary a picture so we can spot you in the crowd, would you?

[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.860]
Here's here's what Brandon says.

[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.180]
He thinks is a decent pole.

[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.860]
What body type turns you on the most except of course for what's your name in her jiggling breasts?

[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.600]
Nancy Pelosi.

[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.860]
Oh, you look, by the way, they should be.

[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:19.580]
I showed that footage.

[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.920]
So now I know what the guy was talking about and I don't know what he's talking about.

[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.560]
She was wearing like the like the thickest.

[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.800]
Let me ask you something.

[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.960]
What do you mean if she was start naked?

[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:29.440]
Okay.

[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.500]
What kind of a turn on would Nancy Pelosi be to anybody?

[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.680]
Even the most desperate of the desperate wouldn't be turned on by Nancy Pelosi.

[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:43.220]
Skinny average tall short muscular swimmers build athletic a few extra pounds fat.

[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.280]
Clean shave and smoother.

[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:49.580]
Hairy that's whatever brand I'll keep it in my pile.

[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.780]
Yeah, you'll take it under advisement.

[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.900]
Classy orientation with Julian Lepper.

[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.260]
Is that in the second race?

[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:04.420]
That's the the rail the one says Greg.

[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.700]
Classy orientation with Julian Lepper run a rail.

[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.360]
He's moving from 15,000 made and claimed to what 20,000.

[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.400]
We've never won two races.

[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:15.880]
Oh, that's ready.

[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.980]
Broke his maiden last time out with a very, very weak speed rating.

[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:20.860]
Bad.

[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.280]
But one easily.

[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.640]
Edge the way in the stretch.

[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.240]
Classy orientation.

[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.140]
Well, you have him.

[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:28.820]
You keep him.

[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:29.080]
Okay.

[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:29.960]
Greg.

[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.520]
The lead, at least somebody sent me a suggestion.

[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.520]
You know what I pick?

[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:35.280]
I pick.

[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:35.780]
I pick it.

[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:36.840]
What?

[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.920]
Me, we ask for help every ton of them out here and get nothing.

[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:40.960]
We get squat.

[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.640]
I heard you're saying yesterday that you like your former home of West, bro.

[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.380]
But you don't like the city as a whole.

[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.480]
I was wondering if you could elaborate as far as I can tell your schedule

[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.200]
consists of eating, sleeping, pooping radio show and gambling.

[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.300]
The only activity where you actually leave the house for is gambling.

[00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.420]
Although, of course, you need also to leave the shop for supplies for eating and pooping.

[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.200]
Sorry, say that.

[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.520]
You dislike the gambling or public.

[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.240]
I guess you tended to leave the house more when you lived in Florida.

[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.120]
No, actually I live that house here a lot more.

[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.060]
There's a lot more to do here.

[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:10.800]
I can attest to that.

[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.060]
So a lot more to you can test to what?

[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.040]
I can attest to this.

[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.460]
Well, just based on what you've said, you leave the house more there.

[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:18.500]
Yes.

[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.460]
You do more up there than you did down here.

[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.820]
And I walk more in one day here than I would there in here,

[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.200]
which of course is why I'm still alive.

[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.120]
But then again, here's another expert on my life.

[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.360]
So many experts.

[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.080]
I think Neil, it's Friday.

[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.500]
You bastard.

[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.020]
Hey, there's voters.

[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.100]
Here's where your vote went.

[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:44.520]
You chose the candidate that made the vote, man.

[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.900]
That's the big brand.

[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.900]
Obama's the brand new president.

[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.360]
All right.

[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.800]
Give it up now.

[00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.480]
Obama's the brand new president.

[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.940]
Change the old education on QA.

[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.820]
Remember those days, Beast?

[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.740]
The education with James Brown.

[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.160]
And he was a good guy at the K.

[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.900]
That's why he got screwed because he was Jewish

[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.660]
and because he wanted to work for nothing.

[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:15.440]
Can we get him back?

[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.120]
We what?

[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:18.780]
That sounds like a shot.

[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.560]
Can we get him back?

[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:21.920]
That's a little shot to you?

[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:22.700]
Yeah.

[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.940]
Especially your buddy, your boyfriend, the program director,

[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.860]
puts on this DA guy, which you said he sucks DAs.

[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.800]
Now, what you said before the show?

[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.900]
No, that is not what I said.

[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.220]
That is exactly what you said.

[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.000]
I said he belongs on ESPN radio or something like that.

[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:36.120]

[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:36.800]
Not on QAM.

[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.460]
He does not belong on QAM.

[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:40.660]
Not.

[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.080]
I heard some of that.

[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:42.960]
That's exactly what you said.

[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:43.660]
Right.

[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.920]
You said that he's not quite as bad as Kevin Rogers,

[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.480]
but almost.

[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.160]
You said Kevin Rogers was the worst.

[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.560]
I said he's very nerdy.

[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:55.820]
You said he sucked.

[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.100]
If you're looking for.

[00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:59.960]
Why don't you stop being such a liar?

[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.100]
Why don't you tell the public what you really said?

[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.400]
You said Kevin Rogers blows.

[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.040]
That's exactly what I said.

[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.220]
Word for word.

[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.540]
Well, pretty close.

[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:12.520]
And.

[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.340]
And George, by the way, if you think that we don't get the great emails,

[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.700]
let me tell you right now you're wrong.

[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:18.360]
Okay.

[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.100]
Here is the best email of all time.

[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.000]
I'm strapped in.

[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.660]
From David G.I.D. W.

[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.120]
No, G.I.W. N.E.R.

[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:26.960]
How would you pronounce that?

[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:27.660]
David Gooner.

[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.280]
G.I.W. N.E.R.

[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:32.140]
Get.

[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:32.860]
Get.

[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:33.140]
Get.

[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:33.540]
Gooner.

[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.320]
Okay.

[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:37.140]
You want me to read it verbatim?

[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.160]
It's so one, two, three, five words.

[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.480]
Wow.

[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:41.960]
I'm friends with Fred Souter.

[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:44.340]
That's it.

[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:45.380]
Dot, dot, dot.

[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:45.880]
That's it.

[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.500]
That's all it says.

[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:48.540]
Me too.

[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.140]
How can you beat that?

[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:53.960]
You can't.

[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.580]
Let's go home.

[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.160]
I think we struck the mother load.

[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.380]
We struck the mother F and mother load.

[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.000]
I'm friends with Fred Souter.

[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:03.520]
Oh, yeah.

[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.880]
I don't know why that's fun.

[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:05.100]
And?

[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.100]
Maybe it's true.

[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:10.760]
And what if it is?

[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.600]
What if I'm friends with Ish Kibbibble?

[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.380]
What, what, what, what, is that AB Ish Kibbibble or a different one?

[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:17.440]
No.

[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.180]
Ish Kibbibble.

[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.760]
Oh, oh, this is the first name.

[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:21.820]
That's not the one I know that.

[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:22.100]
Sorry.

[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.000]
You better start learning your Jews, man, because you sure as hell don't know.

[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:25.740]
I know plenty.

[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.660]
Off to Lasz.

[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.740]
Off to Lasz.

[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:28.920]

[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.320]
Now that's a different expression.

[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.540]
Am I saying the right?

[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:33.360]
I don't need to know.

[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.060]
I've signed Tuchas.

[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.020]
No way.

[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.600]
In honor of Black History Month, what late, great, black entertainer do you miss the most?

[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:45.600]
Although, uh, Charlie Bees is, are you, most sorry, is no longer around to entertain us?

[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.680]
Charlie Bees can take a five word pull and turn into 150 words.

[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.200]
Maybe he wants to school then.

[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:54.560]
Am I right?

[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:54.980]
Yeah.

[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.880]
He is strange.

[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.080]
Charlie Bees, all the chronics are strange.

[00:35:59.260 --> 00:35:59.980]
I mean, I'm strange.

[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.920]
Georgia certainly is strange in the beast.

[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:02.680]
Don't forget about it.

[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:03.880]
No, no stranger to that.

[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.720]
We're all strange.

[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.400]
But I mean, it's all a matter of degree.

[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.560]
Really, really strange.

[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.560]
Is Charlie Bees?

[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.920]
Jimmy Hendrix, 141.

[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.580]
But then again, this is a totally, I say, let's, let's, let's,

[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.340]
I would, redo, redo it.

[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.420]
Do over.

[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:25.820]
Jimmy Hendrix, 141, Richard, prior, 127, red Fox, 75, Ray Charles, 43.

[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.340]
It only take me the midnight to finish reading these.

[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.880]
So if the first race goes off, let me know.

[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:30.400]
All right.

[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:37.280]
Sammy Davis, Jr. 40, Marvin Gaye, 36, Bernie Mac, 29, Louis Armstrong, 27,

[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:42.960]
Ella Fitzgerald, 19, Barry White, 17, that King Cole, 17, Flip Wilson, 15,

[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.600]

Amos and Andy, 10.

[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.360]
You notice how the beast twitters like a girl he had?

[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.620]
I do giggle like a girl.

[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.400]
He giggle like a girl.

[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.560]
He also giggle like a girl, but we don't want to get it.

[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.180]
Oh, God.

[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:00.880]
What a thought that.

[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.460]
That's like Nancy Pelosi and her jiggling.

[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.200]
How jiggling, baby.

[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:05.800]
No, God.

[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.060]
Lou Rawls, eight, Mo' diddly eight.

[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.820]
So we got Lou Rawls on there, right?

[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.140]
What's his, uh, he put it on yesterday?

[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.240]
What's the wrong with you, man?

[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.800]
It sends me another, uh, email today.

[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.580]
So what happened to Lou Rawls?

[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.080]
He's on there.

[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:20.780]
He's got eight votes.

[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.140]
He died.

[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:21.740]
That's what happened.

[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:22.760]
Yeah, that's what happened.

[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.360]
He's dead.

[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.060]
Vodetly dead.

[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.060]

Nifty Ruffal.

[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:31.260]

[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:31.260]

[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:31.600]
Nifty Ruffal.

[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:31.620]
Nifty Ruffal.

[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.300]

[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.100]
There's a thousand names on this freaking pool.

[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.380]
Scan man, Krutus six.

[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.980]
How come Tammy Turell's not on here?

[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.660]
She was great.

[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:42.880]
Yeah.

[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.300]
I mean, she was no nifty Russell, but then again, who was?

[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.260]
You're going to put Tammy Turell on there?

[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.440]
I don't even know who that is.

[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.460]
That doesn't mean that.

[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.760]
Marvin Gaye and Tammy Turell, you don't remember them?

[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.040]
I know who Marvin Gaye is.

[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:57.020]
You're all I need to get by and all the other great duets they did.

[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.660]
There's something wrong with you, man.

[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.780]
You don't know your Motown.

[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.080]
You're too much into the Hurricanes.

[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:02.980]
That's your problem.

[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.280]
You're too much into that teens crap.

[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:04.900]
I told you all the time.

[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:05.800]
Come on.

[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.420]
Tammy Turell?

[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.620]

We have break.

Pearl Bailey four.

[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.000]
Bob Marley, only three.

[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.240]
And that's because we just put them on there.

[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.900]
And everybody, everybody who's listening already voted.

[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.080]
We got 760 votes.

[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:29.800]
That's all audience.

[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.520]
Boy, I sure wish we had 2,000 people to come and watch Joe Belga

[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.580]
and then something carved in his ass.

[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.640]
I'd pay to see that.

[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:38.020]
No.

[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.020]
I do the carving, man.

[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.660]
I'm not a big expert at Thanksgiving time, but that would be great practice.

[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.400]
Carving up his fat ass.

[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:52.080]
Fats Waller three, Count Basie three, Haydn McDaniel two, Eartha Kitt two, Sam Cook one,

[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.600]
Mahalia Jackson one, Lionel Hampton one, Dizzy Gillespie one, Hard Rollins junior one,

[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:02.320]
Oc Davis one, Dorothy Dan rich one, none for Nina Simone, Josephine Baker or Sarah Vaughn.

[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.840]
None for Sarah Vaughn and her broken hearted melody.

[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.040]
What a great song that is.

[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.320]
On Mercury Records.

[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.240]
Broken hearted melody.

[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.880]
Remember you have played that one spot of time.

[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:12.440]
Mm-hmm.

[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.280]
It's in the fall of what?

[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.540]
I wish I could know, but you know.

[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.140]
No, you can't.

[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:18.440]
I'm here.

[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.080]
Now, here.

[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:20.980]
You're out through a golf stream.

[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.520]
How is things going out there?

[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:22.920]
They developed people.

[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.200]
They keep turning the music up over here.

[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.780]
I'm about to go Christian Balan, whoever their sound engineer is in this place.

[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:33.180]
We got them to turn it off and then this instrument goes back into the whatever that passes for a control room here and

[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.300]
cranks it back up on us.

[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.760]
Probably somebody who don't like us.

[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.240]
Probably.

[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.380]
Of course, a lot of territory.

[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.100]
I'm sure of that.

[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.080]
Oh, Tim, subject Bob Prince.

[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.360]
I can only imagine what this is going to say.

[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.440]
Come on, you'll play some Bob Prince.

[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.280]
No chance.

[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.680]
Yeah, you're truly the fake Richie Hebner.

[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.060]
Listening in Colorado Springs, how about I have no life?

[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.600]
I have one of your old CDs and play that bridge tender.

[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.600]
It's still say the bridge tender is the best.

[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.660]
How about playing your best bit?

[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.360]
How about a pull picking your best?

[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.460]
Yeah, we've been there done that.

[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.000]
Go away.

[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.240]
Go away, Tim.

[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.880]
I have no life is correct.

[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.560]
Come on, how about some Bob Prince?

[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.040]
Please, thank you.

[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.200]
How did I ever get suckered at that?

[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.280]
That was like the hockey shows.

[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:19.860]
Am I right?

[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:20.260]
Yeah.

[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:21.800]
Same thing.

[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:23.520]
Bob Prince.

[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.500]
Core Chad, three and a bottom of the 17.

[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.460]
Okay, there's a little Bob Prince for you.

[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:28.960]
That's it.

[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.380]
Even the beast don't know who that is.

[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.360]
How about Fred Cusick?

[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.080]
I don't know, Prince Bob.

[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.160]
When I was in Fred Cusick?

[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:38.100]
Not really.

[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.680]
You're on the 8th of the keep it in.

[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:41.440]
There you go.

[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.620]
There's no Fred Cusick for you.

[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:43.040]
There you go.

[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:43.900]
How about the Turk?

[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:45.500]
The Turk.

[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:46.780]
Derek Sanderson.

[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.840]
Oh, we were talking about him yesterday about that drunken piece of turd.

[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:50.460]
The Turk.

[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.060]
The turd.

[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.760]
The action that was the typo was the turd, not the Turk.

[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:55.740]
Derek Sanderson.

[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.040]
Another dumb ex-jock on the year.

[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.420]
Are there any ex-jocks got to be on the year?

[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:00.840]
I was reading.

[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:01.540]
Where was it?

[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.440]
I'm very jackass today.

[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:06.260]
Well, Brett Farve hasn't accepted any broadcasting job yet, but yeah, yeah.

[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:07.840]
Retire.

[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.680]
Just go away and leave us all alone, Brett.

[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.460]
Can't stand him.

[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.200]
Real redneck.

[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.020]
A real Yehu.

[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.420]
Paul Castronobus says, tell the beast to go away.

[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:18.540]
Go away.

[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:19.100]
Bye.

[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.180]
The ticket is a good place for him.

[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.800]
He can take Josie and Don Bailey Jr.

[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.200]
and the Hurricanes with him.

[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:26.260]
Says Paul Castronobo.

[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.360]
Probably the real one.

[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:32.500]
You do know that all these other so-called broadcasters, the market are obsessed with me,

[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.420]
and they show you do know that.

[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:33.780]
I do.

[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:34.500]
Yeah, I do know that.

[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:35.980]
Obsessed, by the way.

[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:36.700]
Yes.

[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.820]
Or to thank Lino who used to work with us over at Paxen.

[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:40.280]
Remember him?

[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:40.960]
No.

[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.040]
Now he works over here.

[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:46.160]
He wasn't throttled, whoever was the engineer over here, whoever's in their control room.

[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:46.660]
Good.

[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:47.920]
So they hear the music is off?

[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:49.580]
Yeah, I don't hear no music.

[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:49.880]
Yeah.

[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:50.700]
Thanks, Lino.

[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:54.820]
So I think you would have a shot to go.

[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:55.820]
Say Lino?

[00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:56.640]
Yeah.

[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:57.800]
That's what you used to call it.

[00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:01.380]
So yesterday we had the Mad Max, the engineer from Paxen's home.

[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:01.560]
Right.

[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.380]
Maybe the Paxen crowd has taken over.

[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.500]
Maybe that born again, Joe for Jesus bitch is going to show up.

[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:08.620]
Remember her?

[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:09.260]
Bonnie.

[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.400]
How could you forget?

[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:11.880]
Oh, Bonnie remembers the name.

[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:12.380]
Mm-hmm.

[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.960]
All she would do is go around all day, proselytizing about two after Jesus.

[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:16.720]
That's right.

[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:17.920]
They're the only ones who do the right.

[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:22.320]
I know it's hard to believe, but I wonder what Paxen thought about that.

[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:22.840]
Jews for Jews.

[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.720]
Of course, his whole religious thing was just an act.

[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.040]
He admitted that.

[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.060]
I think they're wielding so much of Old Shrew.

[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:28.900]
What?

[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.020]
I think they're wielding a dead body past this right now.

[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.720]
Where do you in Howlanddale?

[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:34.280]
Yeah.

[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:34.960]
Oh, here you go.

[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:36.560]
David Gwynner is back.

[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:43.380]
When you read my initial email this morning about adding jam master Jade, the pool and where we're in Arnold is,

[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.340]
he asked who I was friends with from the show.

[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:46.340]
What?

[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.680]
I asked who he was friends with from the show.

[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:51.920]
You remember that?

[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.920]
No, I don't, but you know, I smoke a lot of dope.

[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.600]
I answered Fred Souther, let you know who.

[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.640]
Not mad or upset about you, but you're my last name.

[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:01.340]
It's hard to pronounce.

[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.360]
You pronounce the W like a V.

[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:04.980]
Givner?

[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:05.980]
Givner.

[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:06.400]
Givner?

[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:07.300]
Givner.

[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.120]
I know it's only a radio show I go to.

[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.700]
Oh, and guess who signs it?

[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:11.960]
New York City Dave.

[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:13.200]
Oh, wow.

[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:13.920]
Lock him him.

[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.260]
That's the ender.

[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:15.740]
Yeah.

[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.980]
Oh, I know what he's talking about.

[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:24.100]
When I said, I said New York City Dave is friends with Zisco or somebody I thought.

[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:24.520]
Oh.

[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.840]
He's friends with Fred Souther.

[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:26.600]
I don't care.

[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.180]
I blocked you.

[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:27.800]
Well, I stole it.

[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.400]
Hold it against Fred.

[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:28.740]
You're done.

[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:29.220]
You're done.

[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:29.720]
You're finished.

[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.740]
You're off the mat.

[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.800]
You're out of the subhuman race.

[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:34.820]
New York City Dave.

[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.180]
And the Ranger is still suck.

[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:37.240]
Oh, Neil.

[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.780]
This is the Neil Roger show.

[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:40.980]
Cool, cool, cool, cool!

[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.000]
So cool, cool, cool.

[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.560]
Yes, it's your brain.

[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.440]
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:45.120]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:45.500]
Any questions?

[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:47.560]
Cool, cool, cool, maybe?

[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.260]
Let's turn this mother out.

[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:54.880]
Pub the MAGICRAPPER is on my TV.

[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.620]
No one heard of him before,

[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.160]
Oh his name is Pub качеi.

[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:07.460]
I said that's Pub the MAGICRAPPER won't be here that long.

[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:14.000]
Not unless he learns to sing on the right of friggin' song, I said,

[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:24.700]
Well, the magic rapper is all over MTV, only because someone shot no glorious viag

[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:31.520]
And guy maybe someone should tell him, making it this way is wrong.

[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:37.520]
Picking at your dead best friend, speaking, plus some balls.

[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:40.960]
Snoop doggy doggy dog on the ball track.

[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.660]
Lebanon 02 at 560 WDQ AM. We got the beast in the studio, we got George out of Gulf Street.

[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.760]
We got the flea out there running around.

[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.220]
He is actually, how did you know? He must be psychic.

[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:53.460]
He's literally running around and I don't know, but he is running around.

[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.720]
I think he's taking pictures of things.

[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.900]
Maybe he's practicing, maybe he's going to be in the second race.

[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.480]
He might be? I'll bet on him.

[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.980]
Let's put a douche on flea.

[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.680]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:09.460]
Ms. Timely Boo says, don't worry about the music and noise in the background of George's audio.

[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:13.080]
I just pretend it's the typical interference from Cuba when here's on the QAM signal.

[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:17.060]
Even Ron Jeremy wouldn't touch 560's tiny stick.

[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.760]
Well, that's going to change pretty soon from what we're hearing.

[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.220]
Is it? A lot of rumors about that.

[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:27.100]
Not that we're going to discuss them on here, but we're going to be a powerhouse.

[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.760]
We are power. I don't think so.

[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:35.420]
What? Huh? You are.

[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.940]
You are a sour as a fruit.

[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.100]
I work in this building.

[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.960]
Yeah. He's not. He's not. He's not.

[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:47.660]
You don't think we're going to have a powerhouse signal?

[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.180]
No. That's what they're telling us.

[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.440]
We're going to kick some big ass.

[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:56.660]
We're going to be like moving out to where sub-center.

[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:57.740]
We'll be there.

[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:01.380]
KFC.

[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.120]
I got a great KFC stray by the way.

[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.900]
But before we get to that, Phil Arck who's a real noodnik.

[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.800]
And what just, you know, I do my own picks, Phil.

[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.920]
I mean, it's always nice to get like some inside information if somebody's got a tip or something.

[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:17.100]
But you don't got that.

[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.100]
He just got some statistical garbage.

[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:24.120]
I know that you've been doing well with your picks, but here are some stats which may inform you're a pick today.

[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.720]
I heard you need some suggestions.

[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.400]
Go with a chalk. It gulfs you.

[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.000]
He's my advice.

[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.040]
And then he's got the stats here about the winning favorites.

[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.200]
45%.

[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.280]
That's a very high percentage.

[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:32.940]
But you know what?

[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.360]
I don't like the chalk.

[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.140]
Because even with a big number like that, that means 55% of the favorites still lose.

[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.300]
They do not win.

[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:43.280]
And the way you handicap is you pick the horse you like.

[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:44.520]
Not what the odds are.

[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.040]
Phil.

[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:47.180]
But Phil is an expert on everything.

[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:48.520]
Phil Arck, you know, that guy?

[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.160]
Yes.

[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:49.880]
Debat.

[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.060]
I speak to KFC.

[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:59.220]
A hazmat call to a Manchester Kentucky fried chicken restaurant in New Hampshire was determined to have been sparked by a hoax call.

[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:06.860]
Firefighters were called to the restaurant on a hoax at road because employees reported eye and skin irritation from fire extinguisher.

[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:11.060]
When emergency crews arrived, they found three employees disrobed outside of the building.

[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:19.800]
The employees told police that the restaurant got a call from someone claiming to be from corporate headquarters who asked them to test their fire suppression system.

[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.220]
So you got along that?

[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:29.460]
When they reported they had chemicals from the extinguisher on their clothes, the caller told them they needed to take their clothes off.

[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.520]
The worker said they then became suspicious when the caller told them to urinate on each other.

[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:44.160]
Two officers were sent to a hospital for treatment for being exposed to chemicals inside the building.

[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.980]
Two employees were also treated to hospital, probably for being peed on.

[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.420]
Third employee refused treatments.

[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.960]
What is wrong with you?

[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.300]
Oh, uh, stuff was making a funny face.

[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.860]
Police said they're investigating the incident as a criminal matter.

[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.600]
The restaurant was closed until health officials were determined to be safe to reopen.

[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:04.000]
KFC released a statement saying it was cooperating with the investigation.

[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.060]
Wow.

[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:07.460]
And...

[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:09.500]
Yeah.

[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:15.460]
Let's see. The beast has portaled quite a bit this morning to his brand and he sent that story and also this one.

[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:15.640]
Huh?

[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:25.020]
A student association in southern Sweden is on lookout for a thief or the preference for extra large condoms after 50 condoms robbers went missing on Monday night.

[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.700]
It says after 50 commodious robbers.

[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:29.860]
Well, what is commodious?

[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.320]
I don't know. Maybe they're out there.

[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.200]
You find in a commode?

[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:40.320]
The thief or thieves used a heavy implement to break into the offices of Project Sex Student Association at London University reports the Lundegarde newspaper.

[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.300]
But according to the staff at the office, all that was taken was a small sum of money and 50 extra large condoms.

[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.940]
I guess the engines weren't going to use in those.

[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.260]
None of the smaller sizes were touched.

[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.400]
They saved those from all of Frolle's Punjabi.

[00:48:54.560 --> 00:49:01.380]
They went through all the boxes but only emptied the one containing Protex extra large projects expo-smine Joaquin Green atoll Lundegarde.

[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:12.200]
Green was also a keen to point out that the association which has the state of the name of helping to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases is only too happy to give away condoms for free during the daytime.

[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.960]
You don't have to come in and steal them.

[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:16.080]
They're given away for free.

[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.160]
Well, here are these two lung heads from a fairground.

[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.920]
This is a field of sticks like I said.

[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:22.080]
John, hang down your head, Tom Dooley, that guy.

[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.940]
Three, number three, he's got a quadro.

[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:29.240]
He's always going to have somebody with a speech defect in some form of broadcasting.

[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.600]
It's always a really good idea.

[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.180]
You know what I mean?

[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:31.960]
Yeah.

[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.340]
It's some kind of a defective sound.

[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.560]
Right, Rangers lost to the Panthers last night, two to one.

[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:44.000]
Rangers, Rangers, every day they lose and they lose and they lose their...

[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.780]
They're sliding just like a down-agreased pool.

[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:46.600]
It's a fire station.

[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:49.060]
They're sliding down the old greased pool.

[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:49.780]
Paul.

[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:54.360]
Well, here's Rastapal who says Bob Marley was for the people of mine.

[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:58.020]
He loved us all even though the ignorant right...

[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:01.540]
Oh, the ignorant might not have accepted his music and believed this is chopped off.

[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.500]
Some day, George will tell me how to stop chopping off that right hand march.

[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.360]
We'll figure it out what these days.

[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:10.840]
Bob Marley's fans wouldn't care if you left him off the pool because he was mixed like Obama mine.

[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:14.420]
Also, don't you think we should stop calling Obama African-American?

[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:15.460]
I don't call him that.

[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:16.940]
I call him Mr. President.

[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.800]
His mom was white.

[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.300]
He's a red bone man.

[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:21.820]
What is a red bone?

[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:24.300]
A half and half fire, imagine?

[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.040]
Is that what that means, red bone?

[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:26.400]
I don't know.

[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.060]
We had that discussion once upon a time ago.

[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.380]
We did?

[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:31.700]
Red bone, my ass.

[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.280]
You don't thank you.

[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:35.780]
I'm sure there's a line though.

[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:39.460]
I'm gonna come meet George and the girl giggling bitch out of the Gulf steam parking lot

[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:40.880]
a little bit with the new crap of the fluff.

[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:41.880]
Oh, great.

[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.480]
What girl?

[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.560]
I think he thinks the beast is out here with me.

[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:51.560]
Oh, another week and I have to tell you really you really helped it fly by your class act mon

[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:55.060]
King of the AM airwaves, much love and respect, blood fire, Rastapal.

[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.160]
Oh, give it a read.

[00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:56.220]

[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.720]
It's time to talk about the 16th annual Caribbean festival that's going on tomorrow with all of Bob Marley's sons.

[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.920]
I'll be there at Bayfront Park.

[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.040]
Is it on Virginia Key this year, I think?

[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:06.800]
Bayfront Park.

[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:07.540]
Really?

[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.180]
That's what Woody Graber told me.

[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.060]
Oh, he ought to.

[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:12.860]
Oh, Woody Graber is a hawk in here that you're looking for more free tickets, huh?

[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:13.780]
All the time.

[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:14.860]
I'm always looking for free tickets.

[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.120]
I can't believe George doesn't go.

[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.260]
There's a lot of smoke in there.

[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:21.080]
I understand that, but it takes more than that to get me to a concert.

[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:22.160]
I have backstage passes.

[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:22.920]
I see.

[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:23.380]
Very good.

[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:26.640]
I go to concerts where I like the other musicians.

[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:31.460]
Pay toilets on plain flights that won't sit well, as article says.

[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:36.180]
If you're playing to fly right in there in the future, you may want to go before you go.

[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:43.020]
You might say that David Ports the Irish airline, one of Europe's largest discount carriers, is seriously considering a fee to pay.

[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:43.580]
What?

[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:44.080]
Move on.

[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.840]
Move on lightly to sit well with passengers.

[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:46.720]
No kidding.

[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:52.620]
Ryan Ear already charges for many basic services, gets 20% of its revenue from drink prices, check bags, etc.

[00:51:53.540 --> 00:52:01.600]
Ryan Ear CEO Michael O'Lury told BBC TV this morning, a £1 fee of £43 to bathroom users would lighten the load on other travelers.

[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.140]
What if travelers don't have the money?

[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:08.140]
I don't think there's anybody in history that's got on board a Ryan Ear craft, which has less than a pound, O'Lury said.

[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:12.560]
Pilots are wondering if they'll get any relief from the airline in the form of toilet tokens.

[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:16.120]
Ah, token of Paul.

[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:16.740]
What?

[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:20.420]
Rasta Paul is back.

[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:22.860]
George is laughing at everything.

[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:24.320]
He's lifted off his ass, man.

[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.660]
I've never heard him laugh so much.

[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:27.920]
I'll trade the dope I bring for some of his.

[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:28.920]
No.

[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.260]
Says Rasta Paul.

[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:30.500]
No.

[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:31.480]
Don't take Paul.

[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:32.660]
I'm good.

[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:33.620]
He's got his own.

[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:34.320]
That's right.

[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.960]
He's got his own red bone.

[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:42.420]
Now, here's Jorge Hernandez, who obviously has got some real serious problems.

[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.740]
For the poll, he says, what about Gregory Hines?

[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:50.760]
Let's see, how many votes does Gregory Hines have on her?

[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:51.580]
I know I remember reading that.

[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.780]
Yeah, let's add him to it.

[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:53.840]
Oh, he's got ten.

[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:55.340]
He's got ten votes.

[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:58.760]
And then it says, never mind, I don't even miss him.

[00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.560]
Says Cuban George.

[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.520]
PSI did send you a message in my space.

[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.220]
Oh, you're the one.

[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.480]
And there were a couple of messages on there.

[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:04.940]
Big deal.

[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:06.960]
That thing is dead than a door nail.

[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.260]
Everybody's into Facebook now.

[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.700]
And then it'll be Twitter.

[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.440]
And then it'll be some other crap.

[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:14.260]
I'm into these great emails myself.

[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.360]
Even though Jorge doesn't like him.

[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.540]
So yesterday, I thought everything was going just fine.

[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:21.520]
And then George said, oh, those emails is like, oh, it's so tough.

[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:22.720]
Talk like a fake one, man.

[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:23.920]
And you know the difference.

[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:26.500]
I don't care whether they're real or fake.

[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:27.260]
I don't care.

[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:27.840]
I know.

[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:30.980]
If they're readable and doable and they kill some good time.

[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:33.020]
And I can make something out of them.

[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:33.380]
They kill it.

[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:34.460]
Here's one redlands gym.

[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:35.860]
What happened to Lou Rolls for the role?

[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.260]
And he says he's on the roles.

[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.560]
Lou Rolls.

[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:40.240]
If you push a part in, he dies.

[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:41.400]
Oh god.

[00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:42.480]
What happened to this one?

[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.200]
What happened to that one?

[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.900]
Open up your eyes and wake up.

[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:45.220]
Live.

[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.260]
You cry, though.

[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.480]
You bastard.

[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.980]
Spears, I champion number six.

[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:01.160]
Phoenix card number six.

[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:02.460]
What they kicked.

[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:04.880]
Rackdom.

[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:08.320]
Spears, I champion.

[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:11.940]
Spears, I champion.

[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:16.980]
Warters, I lose her and I steal her.

[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.080]
I champion.

[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:22.240]
I go well.

[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:23.280]
Yeah, big deal.

[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:23.840]
Screw them.

[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:26.860]
1116 at 560 WQ AM.

[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.460]
Almost baseball season.

[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:30.820]
You all whipped up about the marlins?

[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:32.440]
Yes.

[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:34.680]
And by that I mean you.

[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:35.440]
What?

[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:36.600]
And by that I mean no.

[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:38.680]
Oh, I'm talking about the beast.

[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.000]
No, not whipped up.

[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:41.360]
Now what about the red socks?

[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:42.380]
Yes, very whipped up.

[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:42.680]
Bruins.

[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:43.320]
Yep.

[00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:44.940]
How about those make-believes, baby?

[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:45.700]
Three in a row.

[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:51.180]
Really something when you keep blowing the lead and have to win an overtime or a shootout.

[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.000]
That's very annoying.

[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.040]
Loa Tugal lead twice against the pathetic little girl seeing the islanders.

[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:57.840]
They suck.

[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:03.140]
Faker Larry King who just is illiterate as hell is Bob DeKarle.

[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.220]
Not Bob DeKarle.

[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:07.760]
Bob DeKarle, Paul Isle and Bill McQuig also spelled wrong.

[00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:09.200]
Coming in for the big show on Monday.

[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:09.500]
No.

[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.900]
Nobody's coming in because I'm going to be here and George is going to be there.

[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:14.400]
Right.

[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:15.520]
Nobody is coming in.

[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:16.440]
Are they?

[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:20.260]
I don't even understand that question coming into what?

[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:22.560]
To my 33rd anniversary show on Monday.

[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.740]
Yeah, I'm going to send them all up to you.

[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:28.640]
Faker Larry King thinks we're having all these people in the studio and I'm coming down to everyone.

[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:30.100]
Yeah, your first party up there.

[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.000]
Don't you understand?

[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:32.740]
This is another radio groupie.

[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:33.620]
Don't you understand?

[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:34.040]
I do.

[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:39.740]
Another crazed radio groupie, the fake Larry King and the fake this and the fake that.

[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:40.420]
I don't care.

[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.920]
You just too optied about everything.

[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:43.680]
What do you mean?

[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:44.140]
What do you mean?

[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.680]
It doesn't.

[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.280]
I don't want you reading all this in my building.

[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.800]
I'm using you know in a very low key way.

[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:51.660]
Bile.

[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:53.300]
Yeah, mildly amusing.

[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:58.360]
I've got a few chuckles out of the beast here this morning like Twitter's like little girl.

[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.720]
Yeah, like that.

[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:02.160]
Like a little girl.

[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:06.540]
Jesus Christ.

[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.140]
What was so funny about that?

[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:11.160]
Well, I'm going to find 50,000 idiots like you.

[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.580]
I'd be back in a business again.

[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:14.060]
You know they have that website Twitter.

[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:15.360]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.660]
Twitter is the next to the beast.

[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.460]
Everybody's Twitter these days.

[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.620]
You should uh, well, you just hear me when I get drunk.

[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.000]
That's really a bad shit.

[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.580]
Let's go do that.

[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:25.660]
I'll take a recorder.

[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:26.940]
You hear that?

[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:27.600]
You hear that giggle?

[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:28.620]
Just like a little girl.

[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:30.000]
You chortle and I'll Twitter.

[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:32.480]
Wait, I can't even get that high pitched.

[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:34.180]
Let me kick in the nerds.

[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:35.540]
No, no thanks.

[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.420]
We already did that poll the other day.

[00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:38.600]
Kicked in the nuts.

[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:39.820]
Punched in the nuts.

[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.220]
I don't know that whole business about being punched in the nuts.

[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.260]
I think of oh, and where the hell did I see that?

[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:46.740]
Who gets punched in the nuts?

[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.920]
Oh, I know what movie was in.

[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:50.300]
What the hell was the name of that movie?

[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.880]
We were watching a little bit of it yesterday.

[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.880]
And where the guys get lost in the New Mexico desert.

[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:57.500]
Ronnie Cox is in it.

[00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:58.380]
Right.

[00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:59.560]
I forget the name of it.

[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.080]
The one surviving kid that's in it with him.

[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.800]
My God is just on a scale of 40 billion.

[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:07.800]
I mean, I didn't help him along.

[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:09.700]
Wow.

[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.160]
Who the hell is that actor?

[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:12.520]
Who's that person?

[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:15.040]
And then the one that dies in the desert.

[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.000]
I don't want to ruin it for you.

[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.120]
We don't even know the name of the movie.

[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.120]
What is it called?

[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:18.760]
I don't know.

[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:19.040]
I forgot.

[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.580]
Oh, come on.

[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.680]
I'm IMD being it.

[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:23.780]
Good.

[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.040]
I saw like the last 20 minutes of it again.

[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:28.860]
Last night was on again.

[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.080]
Then I saw what that young man looked like.

[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:34.200]
Yeah.

[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.380]
And that's why I kept watching it.

[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:37.620]
And then they finally made it.

[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:41.900]
They finally made it to the big carnival or whatever the hell was going on.

[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:43.260]
Thanks for ruining it for us.

[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:44.600]
Oh, they didn't die.

[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:46.100]
I mean, the one kid died.

[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:46.520]
Look at that.

[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:48.120]
What?

[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:49.080]
You see how you are?

[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:50.220]
Ronnie Cox.

[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.100]
I heard you liked Ronnie.

[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:02.020]
Now, what else was he in?

[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:02.920]
Deliverance of what else?

[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:04.960]
There are lots of things.

[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.140]
I just can't think of them right now.

[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.240]
You can't think of any other movie he was in.

[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:12.900]
Ronnie Cox.

[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.580]
How come I can't find the movies?

[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:16.860]
Filmography.

[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:20.620]
I don't get it.

[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:21.420]
It's been in a bunch.

[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:22.260]
Yeah.

[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:24.360]
More on IMD be pro.

[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:27.920]
I just want a list of all the movies he was in.

[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.900]
No, I don't want a free trial.

[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.260]
Get out of here.

[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:35.820]
Oh, they're trying to get me to take a free trial for IMD be pro and all this other crap.

[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:38.080]
All I want to do is find frickin Ronnie Cox.

[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:39.140]
He was in Robocop.

[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:40.320]
He was in Beverly Hills Cop.

[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.920]
I'm just moving him to Hell with IMD be.

[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:44.820]
Was in.

[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.940]
You didn't see this movie about these guys guy?

[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.640]
And I don't know what it's really all about.

[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:53.840]
Because they get lost in New Mexico desert.

[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:54.980]
About what year?

[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.080]
We talked about it.

[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.240]
I have no idea.

[00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:58.880]
There's a picture of Ronnie Cox.

[00:58:59.040 --> 00:58:59.600]
He looks old.

[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.020]
I don't want to see D's.

[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:03.000]
He's a singer also.

[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.280]
I don't think that's the same guy.

[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.460]
I guess I guess it might be though.

[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:08.580]
Everybody's a singer.

[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:10.340]
Actor.

[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:10.940]
Here we go.

[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:11.600]
This is a different yet.

[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.240]
It's the same guy.

[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:14.440]
Okay.

[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.260]
Finally, here's the list of the movies.

[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:16.940]
Cold case.

[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:17.360]
That in.

[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:18.140]
It begins with a C.

[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:19.500]
Commander-in-Chief.

[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:20.120]
That's not it.

[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:22.840]
Who's with a C?

[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.120]
Well, he sure made a lot of movies.

[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:25.060]
Crazy as hell.

[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:26.340]
The agency.

[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:27.380]
American outlaws.

[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:30.080]
Wow.

[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:31.320]
He made a million movies.

[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:32.300]
But I can't find the one.

[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.140]
Was he young or old in the movie?

[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.980]
He was older than what?

[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:39.140]
Not agency.

[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:40.300]
You?

[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:41.620]
Who?

[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:42.520]
Older than you?

[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:43.420]
No.

[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:44.560]
Nobody's older than me.

[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.700]
Oh, what the hell's the name of that movie?

[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:50.900]
It's exciting.

[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:52.360]
It is.

[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.440]
Well, how old are you?

[00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.060]
How far can I go back?

[00:59:59.280 --> 00:59:59.660]
Cold case?

[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:00.040]
No.

[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.920]
He was doing movies in the early 70s.

[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.240]
I don't want to go all the way back to then.

[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.140]
This isn't that old.

[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:06.920]
Deliverance, 72.

[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:07.780]
He played Drew.

[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:08.520]
Remember that?

[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:09.740]
Yep.

[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.080]
Found an out and out and out.

[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:11.460]
Yeah.

[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.660]
He was good in that.

[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.320]
Everybody was.

[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:14.840]
Even Bert.

[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.780]
Even Bert Reynolds was good in that.

[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:17.900]
And that's a hell of an accomplishment.

[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:18.160]
Right.

[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.520]
Because I can't stand Bert Reynolds.

[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:20.860]
Oh, you don't like anybody.

[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:21.980]
Well, I sure don't like him.

[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:25.400]
He was good in what you call Boogie Knights.

[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:26.340]
Yes, he was.

[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:27.940]
Yes, he was.

[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:28.500]
Courage?

[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.720]
That's it, I think.

[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:30.080]
Courage.

[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:30.640]
You might be right.

[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:31.600]
1984.

[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.580]
6.2 stars.

[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.640]
That's not too shabby.

[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:38.140]
Really?

[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:39.280]
Out of seven?

[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:40.900]
Ronnie Cox, Art Hingle.

[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:43.580]
Tim Mayer.

[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.480]
I don't know who the people are because they only got like three pictures of people.

[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:48.800]
Art Hingle?

[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:50.940]
Yeah.

[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.780]
That's your is hell not who played that kid.

[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:54.280]
I don't know.

[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.740]
Well, somebody will know something about that movie.

[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.320]
Somebody will call it.

[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:02.840]
I mean, it just went on and on and they're running through the damn tumbleweed and through

[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.180]
the crap and not tumbleweed went through the brush.

[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:06.300]
The scrubby brush?

[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:08.420]
The scrubby brush that's exactly right.

[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.940]
And the kid keeps holding his side.

[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.820]
Like, I don't know if he got shot or what his deal was.

[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.960]
But they sure did a hell of a job to get there.

[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:14.520]
I'll tell you that.

[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.220]
And there was some mean Mexican looking guys.

[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.900]
There were the enemy, the bad guys, you know.

[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.460]
Mexicans are mean in that.

[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.060]
Oh, yeah.

[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.220]
Like Pancho Gonzalez.

[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.440]
Pancho Vía.

[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.260]
Uh-huh.

[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.660]
Fred Souther says, near city Davis out of control needs to get a life.

[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:31.360]
No kidding.

[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:32.300]
No kidding.

[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:32.980]
I blocked him.

[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:33.920]
I'm tired of his crap.

[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:36.540]
By the way, I've been reassigned with this job.

[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.380]
I've been working and listening to most of the show live now.

[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:40.180]
Here's what Wikipedia says about redbone.

[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.720]
And Fred doesn't say anything about his good buddy, David, the givener.

[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:46.960]
Well, maybe David givener, that is New York City Dave.

[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:47.760]
Oh, that's right.

[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.420]
That's what he does say.

[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.220]
He's out of control.

[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:53.500]
Term historically used in much of the Southern US.

[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:59.500]
Redbone has had various meanings according to locality, all in applying a race mixture or misadmissage nation.

[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:01.640]
Mm-hmm.

[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.320]
If you get a massage, you get a red bone.

[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.340]
The term's origin is unknown.

[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.180]
The article pertains to the distinctive Louisiana red bones.

[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:10.880]
Oh, Louisiana.

[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:12.560]
Oh, like Bobby Jindal.

[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:14.320]
What's his name?

[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:14.760]
Paiush?

[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:15.300]
Yes.

[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.440]
Punjabi.

[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:32.180]
The term redbone became disfavored in late 1960s, where it was a perjurative nickname applied by others to the geographically and socially isolated, dark, complex populations in most Western Louisiana parishes from a say-bind perishes in the Northwest and Rapida's perish, whatever that is.

[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:37.780]
You're the center of the state down to Calas, you Calas, Cal Casu, perish in the Southwest.

[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.620]
Cal Casu.

[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.000]
It's them, K-Johns, you know, K-John.

[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.120]
All your...

[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.200]
Yeah, K-John Pepple.

[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:56.500]
This area is roughly... the area is roughly co-extensible, what was once known as neutral ground, or something free state, when O-U-S state exercised jurisdiction over the area, from the Calescue River on the east to the Sabine River on the west.

[01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:05.380]
Families ancestral, the Louisiana red bones came primarily from South Carolina, where they faced legal classification as other free persons, in other words non-white.

[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:12.840]
To the hills and prairies of Western Louisiana, following the Louisiana purchase by the U.S. state, this goes on and on and on.

[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:16.400]
Wow.

[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:27.260]
In recent years, some who belong to our identify with this group have embraced the name, and have established family named genetic and historical websites to collect and trace their common heritage.

[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.320]
Have embraced what name?

[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:30.760]
Redbode.

[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:39.940]
Oh, the DNA results thus far showed that while most of the families have Native American markers and varying degrees, and some of them have sub-Saharan African markers, others lack the matter.

[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.760]
Black the latter.

[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:42.540]
Matter.

[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:55.900]
And makers, markers associated with Romani people, other South Asian people have turned up indicating that in some cases that our completions came as such, along with Protestantism and English surnames via the British Arles, rather than being acquired in America.

[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.700]
Well, whatever that all means, who the hell knows?

[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:05.640]
Somebody says the term for a mixed or light skinned black male is dirty red. A woman of the same is called yellow bone.

[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.000]
Huh.

[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:10.920]
What?

[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.620]
I didn't say anything.

[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:13.580]
Yellow bone?

[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:14.740]
I've never heard that before.

[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:19.060]
Why, do you just learn something? You won't learn that on the Fricking Joe Roche, you'll all tell you that.

[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:25.660]
Oh, and somebody says that that Jack has calls in every morning of the same time, just to piss me off no doubt.

[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:26.640]
Which one is that?

[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.200]
Stormy.

[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:31.180]
Oh, every day at the same time, and he puts him on here. That's the thing I don't understand.

[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.520]
Can you explain that to us?

[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:33.260]
Beast.

[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.220]
He's a part of the show.

[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.760]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.180]
He's a part of the show.

[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.480]
I wonder how much we pay him.

[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.740]
Oh, Neil!

[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:47.280]
More than this.

[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:48.340]
I think the Neil Rogers.

[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.880]
It's Friday, you bastard.

[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:51.500]
Coming.

[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.980]
This Christmas from bogus industries.

[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:58.160]
It's the I can drive like Rick Sanchez board game.

[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:03.780]
It's a real life action adventure game that uses the streets of South Florida as a game board.

[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:08.020]
Start begins at concession stand A of Joe and the stadium.

[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:11.480]
Where each contestant has to drink himself to oblivion.

[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:14.600]
He overgets the highest blood alcohol level first.

[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.880]
Goes on to level number two.

[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:21.620]
The run down pedestrian and the hall has home section of the game.

[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:24.880]
This leads to a court game police battle.

[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:29.120]
And the player must come up with a different excuse to go home and get his license.

[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.480]
This is off to the final leg of the board game.

[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:33.460]
Higher in attorney.

[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:37.680]
Go to court and whoever gets off with the easiest sentence wins.

[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:40.740]
It's ours with bomb for the horse.

[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:44.920]
They I can drive like Rick Sanchez board game.

[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.120]
Wow, that's old Paul Castro.

[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:48.680]
Ain't it?

[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:49.920]
Hello?

[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:51.220]
Yes.

[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.360]
Sorry, I was running around.

[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:54.760]
What does that mean?

[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:55.080]
Hello?

[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.000]
What is that?

[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.060]
I heard you talking.

[01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:57.880]
Yeah.

[01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.000]
And so I said hello.

[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.860]
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in.

[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.300]
If the van to rock.

[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:03.860]
You did that song.

[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:04.780]
I hear you knocking.

[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:05.540]
Who did that?

[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.060]
But you can't come in.

[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.380]
So what was the name of that movie?

[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:11.760]
Control.

[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:12.980]
No, that's what I was writing.

[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:13.740]
Correct.

[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:14.260]
Courage.

[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:15.300]
Very good. Courage.

[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.360]
So one listener out there saw it.

[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.360]
Said that was the name of the movie.

[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:19.800]
Courage.

[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.420]
Hey, I'm not saying it was a good movie.

[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:26.260]
I mean, all they did were you just kept seeing footage on and on.

[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.680]
At least the part I saw where they're like, you know,

[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:32.320]
it was I was screwing through the brush of New Mexico.

[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.300]
And they both keep falling down in the dirt.

[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.660]
And the kids nuts keep flying out of his pantaloon.

[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.020]
So maybe that's why I kept watching it.

[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:41.380]
What?

[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:44.100]
Well, no, there had to be some reason I kept watching it.

[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:47.860]
There had to be a junk kept flying out of his,

[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.840]
well, yeah, these damn gym shorts on.

[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.680]
You know, it's kind of tough to keep it all in when you keep tumbling and rolling around.

[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.200]
That's why you wear a jock strap.

[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.240]
He didn't have no jock strap.

[01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:56.740]
Apparently not.

[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:57.940]
David Edmunds.

[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.180]
David Edmunds what?

[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:00.360]
I hear you knocking.

[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:01.420]
That's right.

[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:02.800]
I hear you're not, are you serial?

[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:04.480]
Either that or Gail Storm.

[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.280]
Gail Storm.

[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.280]
Stormy.

[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:12.540]
Stormcats.

[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.480]
If you don't do something about that,

[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:18.120]
well, why doesn't somebody direct that man in the right direction?

[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.220]
He's lost his way.

[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:19.680]
Ooh.

[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:20.760]
Joe.

[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.720]
Joe Rose has been back and forth across the street so many times.

[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.100]
He's lost his way.

[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:25.540]
Why?

[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.020]
What's wrong with his deal?

[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:29.860]
Stormy?

[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.280]
He's an integral part of the show.

[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.400]
He's an idiot.

[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.560]
If he's an integral part of the show,

[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.000]
then that explains what the problem is, okay, like those numbers?

[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.120]
I mean, give me a break.

[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:44.480]
One thing about the morning sports shows in this market,

[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.860]
you put all of them together, including me for what is .3,

[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.380]
and they still ain't got a number.

[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.660]
And that includes your good buddy across the street there, Sid the Yid.

[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:54.400]
Good, God.

[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:56.660]
I think seldom in the history of this business,

[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:59.260]
if people talk as loud as they have,

[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:01.040]
and head his little to produce for it,

[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.800]
including the punk in the midday.

[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:04.960]
1.9's they got.

[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:05.620]
1.9.

[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.900]
Even Moe could occasionally break that.

[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:10.800]
Let's talk about that far.

[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.260]
Absolutely.

[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.280]
No, don't start ripping on your buddy Moe,

[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.440]
okay, just because he's gone.

[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:16.700]
He got fired again, by the way.

[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:17.620]
He did?

[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:17.980]
Yeah.

[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:20.480]
Where was this?

[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:23.780]
He did games for the sports USA football network.

[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:24.420]
Yeah.

[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.220]
And the word that we got was,

[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.880]
he was hard to work with.

[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:28.780]
No.

[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:30.420]
Moe?

[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.660]
Do do do do do do.

[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.220]
And so the candy's asked?

[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:37.120]
Yeah, he's so he's been fired from literally every job that he's had.

[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.880]
No, come on, not Moe, not Moe, how are David it?

[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:41.420]
Absolutely.

[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:44.240]
Like close personal buddy, with that bad.

[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:45.360]
Do do do do do do.

[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:45.640]
Peace.

[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:46.300]
Not anymore.

[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:48.520]
Here's somebody who says,

[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.760]
how can we ever forget to put the best-ed person on the pool?

[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:51.600]
Mom is Mabelie.

[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.220]
She's the best-ed like person.

[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:53.560]
Amen.

[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.100]
She is?

[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:56.360]
Who?

[01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:57.600]
Mom is Mabelie.

[01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.480]
We'll get her on there.

[01:08:59.860 --> 01:08:59.860]

[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:00.020]
Alan?

[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.560]
Who's making all that noise in the background there, Georgia?

[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:05.040]
Who is it?

[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:06.720]
What do you mean?

[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:07.940]
We got people here now.

[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.080]
I told you they started showing up there.

[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:09.320]
Oh, good.

[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.760]
It's almost new and there's some people there.

[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:11.380]
That's right.

[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:13.040]
And the first post time is 115.

[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.020]
And then we got our second race of 144.

[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:20.780]
I think I'm picking the, I was starting to do this and then you interrupted me.

[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.740]
The one and the ten.

[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:27.360]
And the first race with our 11th horse and the second race.

[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.860]
You want a better couple of $5 doubles?

[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.260]
At least.

[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.320]
Now, now $4 doubles.

[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:36.320]
One, two, and ten.

[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:36.720]
Come on.

[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:37.880]
Let's blow some of my money.

[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:39.160]
One, two, and ten.

[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.140]
There's 12 bucks for it.

[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:41.660]
$4 doubles.

[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.740]
One, two, and ten over the 11.

[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:44.800]
Well, it's too early now.

[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:45.760]
Let's not worry about it.

[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:48.940]
Let's see what the early odds are going to be.

[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:50.480]
Because you know what, what's his name says?

[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.220]
What the chronic philarch?

[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.180]
Oh, bent the chalk.

[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:54.960]
You can have the chalk, okay?

[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.400]
Phil and stick it over the moon.

[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:56.820]
Don't try.

[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.060]
The chalk.

[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:02.600]
Brandon says George must be looking at a picture of Josh Friedman's camel toe.

[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:03.520]
I don't blame him.

[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:05.960]
I would laugh too if I saw it based on the description he gave.

[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:10.460]
And it's the beast somebody must be in the studio tickling him because he's giggling like a girl

[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:11.740]
that the Jonas Brothers movie.

[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.220]
See, oh my god.

[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.120]
Oh my god.

[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:15.560]
Oh my god.

[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.260]
I heard it.

[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:20.920]
Jesus.

[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:22.820]
God.

[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:25.420]
I wonder where they start that feather.

[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.780]
Rectome or something.

[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:27.880]
There's helium in the studio.

[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:29.080]
It must be.

[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:31.540]
It must be.

[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:34.840]
God.

[01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:37.700]
What the hell is wrong with that child?

[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:41.720]
I didn't know they had a...

[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.900]
Is this the BONG show?

[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:45.660]
Yeah.

[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.500]
I've already seen some of these on with George.

[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:53.160]
I love to go to the gym but and then it says, ha ha unbelievable.

[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.640]
I love to go to the gym but what?

[01:10:59.120 --> 01:10:59.520]
Be...

[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.340]
Oh, I had to stop.

[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.040]
I had to stop.

[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:02.260]
Stop laughing about what?

[01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:03.780]
I don't know.

[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:06.800]
But the fact that you're twittering like a little girl.

[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.380]
And by the way, Rooster, a codburn there was giving me crap about the beast.

[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:14.900]
I don't disagree with anything you said Rooster, but you know, it's a radio show.

[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.080]
Didn't I say when I came in here this morning?

[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:17.760]
Yes.

[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:20.160]
And you said, hello, I said, what the F are you doing here?

[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:20.920]
Is that what I said?

[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:21.300]
Yes.

[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:21.980]
Right.

[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:26.580]
And I'm still wondering the same thing but you're here so we got to make the best of it.

[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:27.460]
God.

[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:29.340]
I didn't ask to be here.

[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:30.400]
I understand.

[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:34.980]
No, we appreciate the fact that they had a fat body around the stick in there because flea is out of Gulfstream.

[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:36.120]
I love being here.

[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:37.300]
It's an honor to pleasure.

[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:38.240]
Isn't it?

[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.200]
But I didn't assign myself to this position.

[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:40.880]
I understand that.

[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.140]
Your boyfriend's stuck in there.

[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:44.040]
Clarence.

[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.760]
According to what these clearance assigned a new deal.

[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:48.620]
That comes to share with the know what's going on there.

[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:49.960]
He just signed a new deal.

[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.920]
If you told me you signed a new deal across the street, then I would have had a party on the chair, you know.

[01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:02.340]
But oh no, with us because clearance has got the brand and is just out of control today.

[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:02.960]
What does he say?

[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:03.380]
It hurts.

[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:04.500]
Oh, I see.

[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:05.780]
Police arrest.

[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.200]
Colorado University student accused of attacking her boyfriend's groin.

[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:17.040]
I mean, as little as I know about that, don't most guys want their girlfriend to attack their groin?

[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:19.020]
It's better than how they attack the groin.

[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:21.120]
The University of Colorado students been arrested on suspicion.

[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.680]
She assaulted her ex-boyfriend's genitals when she found another woman in his bedroom.

[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:26.220]
Oh, I see.

[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:26.500]
Oh.

[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.560]
Chaley Simon, 19, was arrested 4 a.m. Saturday by CU police officers who responded to a report of a domestic disturbance

[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.480]
at the Smiley Court apartments on the Boulder campus.

[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:44.760]
Commander Tim McGraw said Simon, a sophomore who lives off campus, went to a former love interest department in the early morning hours and began throwing rocks in his window.

[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:52.820]
When a man opened the door and offered letter come in from the cold, she allegedly became irate and tried to make her way into the man's bedroom across set.

[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:59.040]
After several attempts to remove her from the apartment, the woman allegedly grabbed the man's genitals and squeezed hard McGraw said.

[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.100]
Eventually, the woman left an office and contacted her outside the building.

[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:10.340]
She was arrested and booked into the Boulder County jail on suspicion of third degree assault, domestic violence and first degree criminal trespass.

[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:14.300]
McGraw said the man told officers he started dating Simon about a year ago.

[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:17.120]
They've broken him about 20 times since then. Can't imagine why.

[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:21.160]
He likes to squeeze him, but a little bit too hard, I guess.

[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:24.000]
Squeeze him, but not please him.

[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:25.120]
For a good reason.

[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.100]
Well, I'm sure.

[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:30.560]
Malcolm X is a red bone, you know, says Paul.

[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:37.140]
If you Google an image of him, you see it is light skinned freckles and hair is naturally red typical of red bones.

[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:41.820]
Them bones, then bones, then red bones. I never heard of that before in my life.

[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:43.300]
Did you?

[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:43.900]
Yeah.

[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.500]
The show on the real Roger show.

[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.060]
We've used that expression before red bones.

[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:53.200]
Well, not so much. We went through all of the expressions on one occasion.

[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.000]
Yellow bones.

[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:55.240]
All of these things.

[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.260]
How about pink bones?

[01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.880]
Oh, you're so good.

[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:03.540]
MTV presents 9-inch nails unplugged.

[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.600]
I want a f*** you like good animal!

[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.060]
Damn it, this thing's not on!

[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:14.140]
Malcolm, this isn't working!

[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:20.600]
She threatened you knocked over my bonge.

[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.260]
9-inch nails unplugged.

[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.140]
Only on MTV.

[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.980]
It's 11.45 at 5.60 WQA. I'm happy Friday.

[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.220]
This is our last show for February. How do you like that?

[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.200]
And Monday is our big anniversary show.

[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.780]
33 years on here.

[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.580]
Larry King's coming in.

[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.620]
Greg, you dull.

[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:43.900]
All the people used to work.

[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.460]
All the movers and shakers.

[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.280]
They're all going to be joining you in Toronto.

[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:49.120]
All the movers, shakers and quakers.

[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:50.480]
We're digging up some of the dead people.

[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.520]
The Casper's going to be propped up there at the table.

[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:55.480]
Stand major.

[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:57.460]
The dead and the near dead.

[01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.580]
They've completed it.

[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:00.820]
The bird, we're going to prop him up.

[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.940]
Now I'll get another thing from Johnny Dark.

[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.400]
How good is it to be disrespectful to the bird?

[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:08.120]
The radio showed Johnny.

[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:09.200]
Just lighting up a little bit.

[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:10.960]
You redneck goofball.

[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.060]
And lose the flannel shirts already.

[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:14.160]
Johnny, they went out with nickers.

[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.780]
I'm wearing a flannel shirt as we see it.

[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.300]
Why is it cool?

[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.080]
The breeze way, they call it that for a reason.

[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.380]
You won't believe it, but here this morning it was 48 degrees raining.

[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:25.140]
It's still raining.

[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.340]
And we're still having a TV.

[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:28.800]
Oh, it's still 48 degrees.

[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.500]
That's pretty warm for that time.

[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.740]
But it's going to drop through by the late this afternoon.

[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.060]
It's going to be 0-32.

[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:36.300]
And then overnight it's going to be like minus 12.

[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:41.100]
So tomorrow morning I can get in that cute little solstice there.

[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:42.560]
And I can zip right over to Woodbine.

[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.800]
We'll read about 4-30 in the morning.

[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:44.620]
All right.

[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:45.640]
The road will be dry.

[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.600]
It will be cold or in the hell like the end of the world.

[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:49.660]
What was I just watching?

[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:50.700]
Oh, the racing channel.

[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:50.980]
Sorry.

[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:51.360]
Good.

[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:52.920]
Good what?

[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:53.940]
I was watching that movie.

[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:54.880]
What's it called again?

[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:55.640]
Courage.

[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:55.960]
Courage.

[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:58.040]
I wish I would come on again.

[01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.360]
I sure would like to see that from the beginning.

[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.880]
Maybe there's some naked scenes in there.

[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:02.240]
I don't know.

[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:04.140]
Hmm.

[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.540]
I'll tell you some of the people that they put in those movies.

[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.060]
I mean, you see them once or twice.

[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:12.400]
And they're only there because they're pretty, you know what I mean?

[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:12.860]
Yeah.

[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.280]
Male, female, whatever.

[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.740]
And then you never see them again.

[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:16.240]
Right.

[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:18.140]
Because they really couldn't act in the first place.

[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:19.760]
But they were just there because they probably did.

[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:22.460]
You know, some favors from some people, you know, with some connections.

[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:22.460]

[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.100]
I wish I had some connections.

[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.100]
God almighty.

[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.040]
Courage.

[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:28.160]
I had the courage.

[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.640]
By the way, speaking of good looking people, I guess who finally got married.

[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:34.820]
This is up to Beast's alley.

[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:35.220]
Can I guess?

[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:36.000]
Yeah.

[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:36.600]
Tom Brady.

[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:37.620]
You knew that.

[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:38.180]
Yeah, I did.

[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:39.660]
You have it on your show this morning?

[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:40.700]
What show?

[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:43.260]
Who showed?

[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:46.820]
You're not, you don't participate in that morning thing with Zach and the...

[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:48.080]
No, I, I, Greg.

[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:48.640]
You know Martin.

[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.080]
Jesse and Joe, you know?

[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:51.580]
No.

[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:54.920]
Oh, so what am I giving you, Krab, about what's his name for?

[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:55.620]
Stormy.

[01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:56.460]
Stormy.

[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:57.000]
Stormcan.

[01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:59.120]
I am definitely not involved in the morning show.

[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.700]
Well, if you were you, you got kicked off of it anyway a long time ago.

[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:04.060]
They always fire you off every show.

[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:04.620]
Why is that?

[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:07.400]
I know too much.

[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:08.600]
That's it.

[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.040]
Yeah, that must be it.

[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.820]
You know where the bodies are buried.

[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:15.440]
I always thought that somebody knows where the bodies are buried.

[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.160]
Never gets canned.

[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.480]
Like Gary Sarner, for example.

[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.280]
And what's your take on that situation?

[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:20.800]
Uh, which aspect?

[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:22.360]
I mean, you've been there a long time.

[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:26.340]
The fact that he keeps leaving and coming back and leaving and coming back and they can't

[01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:29.720]
demote him, they can't, they, they, they demoted him from National Sales Manager.

[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:30.340]
They, yeah.

[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.640]
They tried.

[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:33.240]
Put his back.

[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.380]
And he left and they took the keys to the kingdom with him and they said, oh please come back.

[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.160]
Your National Sales Manager again, please.

[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:41.940]
With that magic wand again.

[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:42.820]
Which I don't have that.

[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:45.500]
There it is.

[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:47.820]
Well, what is that all about?

[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:51.860]
I mean, I, I know there's some folks that are going to make pictures of Greg, especially Greg Reed.

[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:55.720]
Man, he was screwing everything that moved.

[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:57.680]
What?

[01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:58.580]
You know it's true.

[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.180]
Just one person in particular.

[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:00.920]
No.

[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:02.040]
No?

[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:02.800]
No.

[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:03.560]
I didn't know that.

[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.000]
You better have a chat with George.

[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.780]
He'll give you all the uh, inside dope.

[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:07.860]
Yeah, I'll give you all the dope.

[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:08.680]
Sweet.

[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.600]
I need it for tomorrow.

[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.300]
Pretty tomorrow, what?

[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:12.120]
You got to show them on?

[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:12.640]
I know.

[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.800]
Oh yeah, the piece is not from four to seven pm.

[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:15.300]
Wow.

[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:17.420]
I'm going to have the Bob Marley fest after that.

[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.420]
Oh, so you're going to be stoned off your ass on here tomorrow between four and seven?

[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:23.680]
No, after that.

[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.560]
The pieces getting ready for Bob Marley, man.

[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:33.540]
Though they've been denying that we even engaged repeatedly, Brazilian Supermodel and Leo de Caprio's ex.

[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:35.580]
Leo de Caprio's ex.

[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:43.200]
Jezel Bunchen, quietly wed New England Patriot, put her back Tom Brady on Thursday night, US Weekly's reporting.

[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.380]
Leo de Caprio's ex.

[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:47.080]
Ex what?

[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:50.240]
She was married to that or with him.

[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:52.300]
What's that noise?

[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:55.540]
Uh, those are what are you called?

[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.960]
The carts, the food carts.

[01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.240]
Racks of trays.

[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.000]
And what are they screaming about?

[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:03.460]
That's an exciting thing with the racks of trays.

[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:03.840]
Go roll.

[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.180]
People like when they change like when they change the money boxes and the slot machines it would buy.

[01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:15.040]
People will actually put a placing bats on which rack would get to the door first.

[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:15.900]
Yeah, same thing.

[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:18.900]
The Catholic ceremony took which began at dusk place.

[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:22.180]
Boy, this is written very poorly.

[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:22.640]
Who the hell?

[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:23.760]
Where did this come from?

[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:30.640]
The Catholic ceremony took which began at dusk place at St. Monica Church in Santa Monica, California.

[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:36.100]
And was very small in the middle with most guest being immediate family, including Tom's.

[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.080]
What?

[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:41.220]
Tom's young son with ex girlfriend Bridget Moynihan.

[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:41.700]
Yes.

[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.100]
John Edward Thomas Moynihan.

[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:45.360]
He's got a young son that's old enough to come to the wedding.

[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:46.540]
Well, he's like two.

[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:59.920]
The magazine says Jezel Warren, a form fitting Ivy Lee strapless ground with a trumpet skirt, scalloped edges, long train in a floor length veil with attached handmade satin roses, and attached satin headband all by Dorce and Gabana.

[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:01.460]
D&G.

[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:07.240]
Bunshans three dogs were also part of the ceremony wearing matching doaching about a four-row lace collars.

[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:08.660]
Oh my God.

[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:10.820]
The pair have been dating since 2006.

[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.000]
It says congratulations.

[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.380]
So that's Mrs. Tom Brady to you.

[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:17.380]
I mean, Jezel Bunshan.

[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.180]
Are we proud of Tommy?

[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:20.740]
Yeah.

[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:22.840]
I tell you one thing, eat no mad castle.

[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:27.700]
Now, how are they going to resolve that beast?

[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:32.000]
What's the resolution that dilemma?

[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:33.200]
Tommy is still rehabbing.

[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:35.560]
I think they made Castle the franchise player.

[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:36.060]
I know that.

[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:38.880]
So he looks pretty good to me.

[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.180]
That mad castle, I'll tell you.

[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:43.260]
He's going to look at him a first round pick if they train him or they'll keep two.

[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.040]
They'll keep a pair.

[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:46.180]
Something like that.

[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:48.640]
George, he's got a huge pair.

[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:49.340]
That's what I'm hearing.

[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:49.940]
Oh, who?

[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:51.700]
That's what mandates told me.

[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.900]
He said that mad castle's got a huge pair.

[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:57.940]
Boy, you know something?

[01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:01.000]
Do you have any idea how blessed I am that I don't get any calls from rumor anymore?

[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:02.240]
Oh, God.

[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:02.960]
Look at the rate of that.

[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:04.220]
No thanks.

[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.180]
Yeah, do a hockey show.

[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:08.840]
Tell Remember you want to do a hockey show when you're on.

[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:11.240]
Not what I'm on.

[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:14.140]
How did you ever let me get suck it into that crack?

[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:15.960]
Tell me about it.

[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.220]
I mean, this is in a market where there are 15 people.

[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:21.860]
But when we got Pavel Brewery, there weren't 10 people who even knew who the hell that was.

[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:24.880]
By the way, yes, they're bringing the rats back.

[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:27.500]
From where?

[01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:30.840]
They've sent all of our talk shows, those boxes with rats.

[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:34.980]
Oh, that's the fact they're bringing the rats around the station.

[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:35.340]
Yes.

[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.620]
I mean, the other plastic ones.

[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:37.860]
You know, it's the half of the rubber rats.

[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:39.200]
You're seeing rats in my room.

[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:43.680]
Are you serious to bringing that back?

[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:44.040]
Yes.

[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:46.140]
For their big playoff run.

[01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:47.960]
Hey, they're going to make the playoffs.

[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.620]
You'll see they're doing pretty good.

[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.320]
I don't think they're going to keep J.

[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.140]
Bowmister, no matter how you pronounce his name is not Bo Misteur.

[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:56.360]
Okay.

[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.600]
It's not Bo Misteur, Gildi.

[01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:58.660]
Bo Misteur.

[01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.560]
J. Bowmisteur.

[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:00.540]
They Bo Misteur.

[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.220]
Perpe, you're trophy, Gildi.

[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:02.520]
You're annoying.

[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:05.400]
You wouldn't, uh, that moron frog that you work with.

[01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:07.220]
They showed him last night.

[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.860]
They had the Ranger Telecast on my package.

[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:10.520]
Of course, Sam Rosen.

[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:14.520]
And they showed Denise sitting up there in a press rocks with Steve Goldstein.

[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:18.520]
Do you have any idea how much Sam Rosen sounds like Mo?

[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:20.100]
No.

[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:21.200]
No, not you.

[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:25.540]
I'm talking about, you know, they're all from the same, uh, Ilk.

[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.440]
They're all at New York Jewish sound.

[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:27.800]
Yeah.

[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:29.900]
Oh, Sam Rosen's very good.

[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.220]
And he's a good guy is what I'm told.

[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:32.920]
He probably hasn't been fired some of the eight times.

[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.560]
No, he's been doing the Ranger Games a long time.

[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.000]
You know who does the games on radio?

[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:45.540]
Speaking of much mouth and speaking of nepotism, Kenny Albert.

[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:46.600]
Oh, yeah.

[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:54.260]
I mean, he is, if he isn't the worst example of nepotism,

[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:57.620]
although I'm telling you even worse is that the creep by Anderson's pooper there on CNN.

[01:22:59.340 --> 01:22:59.700]
Right.

[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:01.420]
Oh, is this the first race at aqua?

[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:03.300]
I don't know if you're going to be gal, but I think I'll be.

[01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:04.260]
Oh, no, that's there.

[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.300]
They got a long way to go.

[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:06.900]
38 minutes to post.

[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:10.400]
And we got to 115 at Gullstream for the first race.

[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.000]
Now, is what's his name is Steve out there with you?

[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:13.620]
He is.

[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:15.300]
He's fetching food as we speak them.

[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.180]
Really good.

[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:16.420]

[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:17.060]
Good.

[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:22.080]
He is to you what I am to like Paco, you know, like a man servant.

[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:24.420]
Yeah.

[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:26.180]
They will just deliver you boy in the city.

[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:26.620]
That's me.

[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:28.040]
Steve's a very useful man.

[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:28.960]
More good.

[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:32.820]
Tom, don't not, don't, don't come to mind.

[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:33.260]
I don't know.

[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:34.240]
It's okay.

[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.200]
Yeah, the week's day you're out there, if you're going to be betting.

[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:36.920]
Mm-hmm.

[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:40.100]
That I can pick the first race for you.

[01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:40.260]

[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:43.640]
You know, it's better to pick it from the racing from the just to pick a number,

[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:45.300]
although sometimes just picking a number is good.

[01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:47.340]
In fact, I just dropped a number in my chair.

[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:49.420]
That I just picked a winner.

[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:50.580]
Did you?

[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:51.480]
Well, good for you.

[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:52.600]
Oh, it was a winner for me.

[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:56.240]
But that was the excuse is.

[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:57.160]
Here what?

[01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:00.100]
He knew that you would want a handicap the first race as well for me.

[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:00.740]
No, I did not.

[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:01.900]
Of course I didn't.

[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:03.720]
The handicap this bunch of pigs.

[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:04.380]
Whatever.

[01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:05.740]
My god.

[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.940]
The more you know, you know, what's the class there?

[01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:10.560]
Maiden, Phillies and Mirrors, four-year-olds and up.

[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:13.160]
Four-year-olds and up, which you have never won a race.

[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:13.980]
Whatever.

[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:15.180]
That's me.

[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:15.520]
That's me.

[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:16.240]
Phillies and Mirrors.

[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:17.300]
Surely gave you somebody back.

[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:18.960]
That old game era, Shurine, what's he used to be?

[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:20.380]
You pick it on Shurly Tweeters again?

[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.040]
No, no, no.

[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:22.680]
Shurly came by and gave me some money.

[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:23.120]
Wait to me.

[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:24.480]
Oh, Shurly, Shirley, Yon.

[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:25.240]
Yeah.

[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:26.840]
Well, thanks, Shirley.

[01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:27.960]
What's he giving you money to bet on?

[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:29.460]
She gave you money?

[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:31.240]
She gave you money and I want to give it back.

[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.060]
She's way too nice.

[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:33.640]
You can't take money from her.

[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:35.500]
You can take a ticket from her but not money.

[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:36.940]
I know I want to give it back to her.

[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:38.260]
I brought my old money to lose.

[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:41.280]
How much money did she give you?

[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:41.840]
40 bucks.

[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:43.420]
40 bucks for what?

[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:44.280]
I don't know.

[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.000]
I guess she loves me.

[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:48.080]
But I don't want to take it.

[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.380]
What kind of scam have we got going on there now?

[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:51.580]
Bring George a bunch of money.

[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:52.520]
You know, you said that.

[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:53.380]
You actually said that again.

[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:55.100]
Yeah, that's why you give it to God.

[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:55.760]

[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:57.720]
Send it to me, honey.

[01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:58.940]
I can't just let it woodbush.

[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:00.700]
This is Mark Morgan.

[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:03.680]
It's the 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:09.700]
Remember when we faced Matt Mal.

[01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:10.260]
Yeah.

[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.700]
Dems with a salad toss in days.

[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.900]
Like the time you wrote my face joke.

[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:17.160]
Hello, everybody.

[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:18.220]
Welcome to the premiere.

[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:19.780]
What a boy's name in a joke.

[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:20.760]
For delightful.

[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:24.540]
I was open to payment and information to help you get through

[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:25.780]
your busy day to day.

[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:29.200]
Actually, you know, yeah, I'm just going to talk about sports.

[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.480]
Here's the scores.

[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:33.640]
Seven or two, seven or three.

[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:34.620]
How about the dolphins?

[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:35.560]
Blah blah blah.

[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.320]
Hey, what are you doing walking through here in the middle of my show?

[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:40.900]
I was looking for the NFL Concubine.

[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.240]
What are you thinking walking through my show?

[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:44.380]
I don't know.

[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:45.120]
I don't know.

[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:46.340]
I know like this in the background.

[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:47.860]
What the f*** is it with you?

[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.940]
That kind of language is going to get your rate.

[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:51.560]
Do you know who I am?

[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:52.620]
I'm bold.

[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:53.480]
David did it.

[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:54.880]
And it's f***ing distracting.

[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:55.300]
See?

[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:57.500]
Haven't someone walked through the middle of my show?

[01:25:58.240 --> 01:25:59.760]
Do you have f***ing answer?

[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:00.660]
I don't understand.

[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:03.040]
What don't you understand, did it?

[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.700]
I just don't know why we need another sports show.

[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.280]
I mean, what else can you say that there's only so much to talk about, you know?

[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:15.360]
Oh, and buy it away, so I hit that last piece of pizza pie in the back room there.

[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.880]
Good for you.

[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:19.260]
Thank you.

[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:21.020]
It was tasty, too.

[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:24.000]
Was my name on the f*** box?

[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:25.280]
Yes, and right there.

[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:26.480]
Most pizza.

[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:28.160]
Get out of my studio, Bub.

[01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:30.640]
All right, let's get this show back on track.

[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:32.240]
Can I just take a second here?

[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:33.420]
I'll give you a second.

[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.380]
I'll give you two seconds.

[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:38.580]
And you better use them to get the hell out of here.

[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.020]
I don't understand why they're there.

[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:44.440]
You don't understand what it's like working with professional broadcasters.

[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:45.260]
Is that it?

[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:49.960]
Well, they're calling yourself a broadcaster, but you're not really a broad.

[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.480]
I never wonder about that.

[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.120]
Thanks for within my show.

[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:55.340]
I enjoyed it.

[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:56.800]
Why don't you turn it a little bit?

[01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:57.720]

[01:26:58.260 --> 01:26:58.640]
Ah!

[01:26:59.500 --> 01:26:59.820]
Ah!

[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:00.440]

[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:00.780]
Ah!

[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:01.680]
Ah!

[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:02.040]

[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:02.300]
Ah!

[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:03.280]
Ah!

[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:06.700]
What?

[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:07.880]
Sure doesn't take time.

[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:08.720]
Oh, yeah.

[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:10.300]
Then why are you spooning me?

[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.360]
Doesn't take time for the word to get around.

[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:13.800]
There's a message board here.

[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:14.900]
Radio info boards.

[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:15.880]
Out.

[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:19.080]
And somebody asked, what became of Mo?

[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.760]
Under listing Mo Howard David.

[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:25.020]
It says, I was listening to the Aradgers today.

[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:26.660]
They mentioned something about him being fired.

[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:27.340]
Is this true?

[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:28.860]
What is the latest on him?

[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:33.580]
And somebody writes back, Mo was still doing film work on Sirius 124.

[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:35.680]
He was hosting late hits every Thursday.

[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:38.800]
How do you like that?

[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:39.780]
Huh, really?

[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.440]
In a matter of moments.

[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:42.160]
Mo?

[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:45.160]
In a matter of moments, that's correct.

[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:48.160]
On radioinfo.com.

[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:49.800]
You know what I like that?

[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:53.300]
At one point in time I heard he was trying to become a professional poker player.

[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:56.620]
Oh, he was doing the play by play, the blow by blow on the poker.

[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:56.980]
Remember that?

[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:57.840]
The World Series of Pokers?

[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.800]
Yeah, but no, but then he was going to be a player.

[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:01.420]
Yeah.

[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:04.220]
Kind of like George.

[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.420]
George here wants to play.

[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:07.000]
You don't want to be a spectator.

[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:07.900]
He wants to play the game.

[01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:08.460]
That's right.

[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.040]
I try to turn him on or watch him hockey.

[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.120]
He's in, I'm going to go play it.

[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:12.840]
I'm going to be the goole.

[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:13.880]
The goole.

[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.440]
Tampa Bay downs 22 minutes to post time for the first race of Tampa Bay.

[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:19.640]
I just love hearing that guy.

[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:20.900]
I don't know what his name is.

[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:22.380]
He's pretty good.

[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:24.880]
And there off.

[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.240]
He's just a wild man.

[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.460]
I like that woodbunk guy better.

[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.260]
Oh, you stopped.

[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.160]
Damn, Lloyd's L.

[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:31.920]
He's just boring his elephant poop.

[01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:33.820]
There off.

[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:34.680]
There off.

[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:34.720]
There off.

[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:37.060]
He's not as disinterested like, you know, like, he cracks me up.

[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.300]
Does it really?

[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:38.660]
Well,

[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:42.860]
I want to have a little excitement there for, oh, surely, Jan says.

[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.300]
How can surely be sending me emails when she brought you money?

[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:47.960]
I guess she moves fast.

[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:48.860]
Huh?

[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:52.340]
She was here earlier.

[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:53.340]
And now she's done.

[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:54.300]
That was two hours ago.

[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:55.540]
Oh, two hours ago.

[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:57.860]
It says I owed him that money.

[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.020]
On a ticket, I bet for him on the 13th.

[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:04.860]
I meant to keep it separate, but I got, it got cashed in with the others.

[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.360]
So I had to estimate his winnings.

[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:07.140]
Wow.

[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:09.220]
Also, I put a guy go cartoon in there.

[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:09.980]
He can't give it back.

[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:10.460]
It's his.

[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:12.220]
Cartoon.

[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:12.840]
What is that?

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.800]
What does that mean?

[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:16.940]
She put a, like, a cartoon in there.

[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:18.500]
No, no, I don't mean that part of it.

[01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:19.440]
I'm talking about the fuck out of you.

[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:19.600]

[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:20.620]
I can't give it back.

[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:20.980]
It's mine.

[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:22.380]
I guess she bet it on my behalf.

[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:23.220]
Very sweet.

[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:23.960]
She bet it for you.

[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:26.220]
Well, don't, hey, you're already 40 bucks to the good.

[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:27.040]
I just watched.

[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:27.360]
Woo!

[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:30.900]
I would just be a spectator.

[01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:31.580]
No, no, no.

[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:32.580]
That's no fun.

[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:33.320]
That's no fun.

[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:36.160]
Well, just make Phantom Beds, you know, pretend beds.

[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:36.840]
Nope.

[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.320]
I'm going to show what we're doing today.

[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:39.100]
I'm what I'm seeing.

[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.580]
The Francis says it's raining here in Florida.

[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:42.140]
I know how it is in the Helenville.

[01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:43.860]
Well, what happens if it rains during the race?

[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:45.100]
They keep running, Brandon.

[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:46.700]
Rain, snow, sleet.

[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:48.700]
Unless the track gets affected.

[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:49.740]
Is the raining hard there?

[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:50.380]
I doubt it.

[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:51.000]
Here?

[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:52.040]
Yeah.

[01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:52.960]
It's beautiful here.

[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:53.880]
Well, there you go.

[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.260]
It's hardly cloudy, beautiful, sunny.

[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:56.180]
It's not raining in the Helenville.

[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.840]
I don't think it's even raining here anymore.

[01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:58.840]
The sun is poking out.

[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.340]
And it's plus nine.

[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:01.120]
It's 48 degrees.

[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.560]
It's much too nice for me to be inside here.

[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:08.860]
Let me take my handheld mic if I had one and go out on the street corner.

[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:09.560]
How's it going?

[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:10.900]
Hey, Sparrow, some change, mister.

[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:12.060]
What?

[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:13.020]
Hey, you're laughing.

[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.920]
I just filled out my talent sheet for February and after Phil and that.

[01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:17.080]
And then Duff comes in.

[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:18.920]
Oh, we don't have any restaurant for next week.

[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:20.940]
Oh, gee, I think we're going to lose it.

[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:22.500]
Oh, boy.

[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:25.600]
He's a good guy and he means well, but he is so depressing, you know.

[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:27.280]
Muff.

[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:28.020]
Well.

[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:29.700]
Oh, and what are you eating?

[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:30.420]
Oh, you're having lunch?

[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:31.280]
Yeah, ma'am.

[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:32.700]
Steve Sloan Bartje launch.

[01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:34.060]
Did you tell my pick for the race?

[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:38.240]
Yes, but we're waiting for a confirmation.

[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:41.340]
So if you want to change your mind, a confirmation on what?

[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:43.100]
I'm still picking the 11 horse in the second race.

[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:46.240]
Well, that's my pick as of now, but I have right up till the post time.

[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:48.260]
I mean, suppose the 11 takes a nasty dump.

[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:49.320]
They're out on the camera, you know.

[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:52.220]
I told you had the one to and 10 over the 11.

[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:53.240]
Right.

[01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:53.820]
That's a double.

[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:54.320]
Very good.

[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:54.920]
You're getting there.

[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:58.600]
And of course Phil Arks is bet the chalk bet the chalk.

[01:30:58.620 --> 01:30:58.940]
Yeah.

[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:00.240]
Chalk my ass.

[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:02.200]
I got a new a new faker.

[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:03.120]
A new faker.

[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:04.460]
I don't know if you're going to remember this name.

[01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:08.040]
Will you listen to me and stop with the fake laughing?

[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:12.300]
Oh, yeah, I'm thinking a new fake emailer, the fake Steve Rodden arrow.

[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.620]
That's a vaguely familiar.

[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:17.260]
He was an anchor on channel seven in the eighties.

[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:19.500]
Remember him beast.

[01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:21.200]
No, Steve Rodden arrow.

[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:26.460]
You don't remember Steve Rodden arrow from channel seven used when was he an anchor in the eighties?

[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:27.240]
I wasn't here.

[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:31.920]
Oh, I mean, I would come down here, but I didn't live here.

[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:34.020]
Steve says hello, Neil.

[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:34.980]
I'm not sure if you remember me.

[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:37.260]
I was a news anchor on channel seven back in the eighties.

[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:39.320]
I listened from time to time on the internet.

[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:43.700]
I'm concerned about your feelings for two of my former co-workers, Sally Fitz and Rick Sanchez.

[01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:48.280]
Why do you have a lingering bad taste for these two fine news journalists?

[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:52.600]
So Sally likes to penetrate her rectum and Rick likes to booze.

[01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:54.340]
Does that give you the right to make fun of them?

[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:54.740]
Yes.

[01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:56.100]
What's next?

[01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:57.280]
You're going to make fun of Bob Soap?

[01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:58.440]
Next, no, I like Bob Soap.

[01:31:58.480 --> 01:31:58.960]
He's a good guy.

[01:31:58.960 --> 01:31:59.660]
He's a friend of ours.

[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:02.060]
What about Wayne and Toby reading the Sunday comics?

[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:02.620]
Yes.

[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:03.780]
Is that Wayne Chandler?

[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:04.200]
Yes.

[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:05.440]
I like that one.

[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:05.760]
I like that one.

[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:06.800]
I like that one.

[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:07.460]
I like that one.

[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:08.760]
He's one of the weather guys.

[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:11.040]
No, I'm not going to make fun of the people I like.

[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:14.460]
I'm going to make fun of the people who were like clowns, like ass clowns, like Ricky

[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:17.580]
Tiki Sanchez, and Sally if it fits stick it.

[01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:23.080]
Sir, please refrain from disrespecting two quality news journalists in junior day and the

[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:23.600]
Toronto weather.

[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.180]
You're truly Steve Rodden arrow.

[01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:26.940]
Actually, I'm enjoying the weather from inside.

[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:28.080]
It's like 48 degrees.

[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:31.820]
It's sunshine, although it's going to be colder and hell overnight.

[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:32.620]
The muddy sun.

[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.020]
It's going to be in this breeze way right now.

[01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:35.260]
Really cool?

[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:39.260]
Well, the sun never gets into this corridor here if you recall.

[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:43.060]
Now, I would think since it's 1208, let me take a puke and see if they got the eye.

[01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:44.660]
Now, they just got Tampa Bay and Aquino.

[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:45.980]
Don't let me forget about Tampa Bay.

[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.000]
Don't forget Tampa Bay.

[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.680]
Because I want to hear that guy.

[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:50.840]
I think he's maybe somebody knows his name.

[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:52.140]
The race caller with Tampa Bay down.

[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:54.800]
You think Flea might know it.

[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:55.680]
But Flea is a Tampa guy.

[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:57.320]
He knows although he doesn't go to the track.

[01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:58.140]
I don't imagine.

[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:02.060]
He only goes to the track there because it's our job.

[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:03.100]
That's right.

[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:04.120]
It's a job.

[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.820]
500 screaming teenage girls and right in the center of Neil Rogers with his 3D glasses on.

[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:12.640]
Where to pick shirt?

[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.860]
Oh, this is the first race at Tampa.

[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:15.800]
Now it's a replay.

[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:16.260]
Your picture.

[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.460]
This horse chases three wide the whole way.

[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.340]
But also this horse chases three wide.

[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:21.740]
All these experts, man.

[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:23.120]
All these experts.

[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:24.740]
They've all got an angle.

[01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:26.160]
They've all got and then they don't have the winner.

[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:27.200]
That's the thing that kills me.

[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:28.040]
If they're so smart.

[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.000]
Now what did Ron?

[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:30.820]
What's his name?

[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.280]
The guy that picks the Nickeletti.

[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:34.200]
What?

[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.140]
Oh, I looked it up during the break.

[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:37.860]
He picked the same horse I did.

[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:41.560]
Well, he did that last week and that didn't work out too well.

[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:45.440]
He picked a doctor, uh, Uga Buga.

[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:46.300]
Whatever his name is.

[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:47.540]
No, he's not running again.

[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:48.480]
He's still running.

[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:53.100]
Mr. Doctor Professor with the Kent the Sormal from the 11th grade.

[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.840]
He's not going to get squeezed.

[01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:57.920]
You know, he's got a clear shot from the outside.

[01:33:58.260 --> 01:33:59.940]
How long is that race seven and a half for a long?

[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:01.020]
Yeah.

[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:05.900]
Are you getting excited about the races now or what?

[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:06.660]
Like you don't believe.

[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:08.400]
George is out of costume.

[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:09.420]
Go bring him a bag of money.

[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:11.300]
Surely already bought him 40 bucks to steal.

[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:11.900]
That's a good start.

[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.280]
That's an excellent start.

[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:15.100]
I think I think we're on to something now.

[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:16.900]
Nobody the bag of drugs and an old bag.

[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:20.060]
What's your name?

[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:23.080]
Let's see how that turns out.

[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:23.080]

[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:23.080]

[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:23.080]

[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:25.600]
That poll is going just the top few 858 votes.

[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.560]
I think what maybe I get to a thousand today.

[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:29.240]
That would be really a feather in my cap.

[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:30.540]
Wow.

[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:34.060]
Another stupid expression of feather in your cap.

[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.200]
What does that mean?

[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:36.500]
Have we ever looked that one up?

[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:38.080]
No, I would think it's obvious.

[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:39.620]
It is.

[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:41.680]
I bet the day you were in your cap.

[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:42.620]
If you had a feather.

[01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:43.980]
Sounds really gay to me.

[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:44.580]
You got a feather.

[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:45.440]
That made a fancier.

[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:47.860]
Wonder if Tom Brady wears a feather in his cap.

[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:49.140]
Not in his cap.

[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:52.520]
I thought here was a nice clean cut boy.

[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:54.500]
And here he's been screwing his brains out.

[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:55.360]
All that other crap.

[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:56.400]
Remember that old guy?

[01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:57.140]
That old fossil?

[01:34:57.420 --> 01:34:59.400]
Back then, he really used to take those stupid phone calls

[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:01.300]
from really, really stupid people.

[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:03.860]
Really stupid.

[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:06.660]
Not just ordinary stupid, but extra stupid people.

[01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:10.380]
In honor of Black History Month, what Black entertainer?

[01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:11.520]
Which dead one you missed the most?

[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:15.940]
Jimmy Hendrix 154, Richard Pryor 137, Red Fox 82.

[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:19.240]
And then way down to Rachel's 49.

[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:21.160]
Marvin Gaye is in there with 40.

[01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:23.500]
I'm just picking and choosing.

[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:24.220]
Now I'm going through.

[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.440]
Let's see how James Brown has got nine.

[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:28.640]
Bob Marley's only got eight.

[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:31.840]
Do you know that Bob Marley got eight?

[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:33.320]
All the time.

[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:36.880]
Sarah Hawn don't have any of these Josephine Baker or Nina Simone.

[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.440]
We didn't put Tammy to her.

[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:39.780]
Oh yeah, well she got one, see?

[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:42.940]
If she'd been on there from the get-go,

[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:44.380]
she'd be doing a lot better than just one.

[01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:45.840]
Fats Waller's got three.

[01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:49.120]
You know, he was the inspiration for Fats Domino.

[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:49.680]
Did you know that?

[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:50.120]
No.

[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:50.880]
You do now.

[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.820]
And Con Fats Domino from New Orleans.

[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:54.460]
Walkin' to New Orleans.

[01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:56.800]
I love Fats Domino, man.

[01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:58.960]
That was my big thing when I was a kid.

[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:00.820]
That's the only big thing I had.

[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:04.140]
It was being the first one in the hood to get the new Fats Domino record.

[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.120]
Every time I would come out.

[01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:05.680]
Excellent.

[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:08.460]
I'd go down to Miller Music on Main Street in Canada,

[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:10.440]
in New York, and I'd get the new Fats Domino record.

[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:12.400]
I'm walking, remember that?

[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:13.860]
Yeah, Rick Nelson recorded that.

[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:15.740]
I really hated him for about two minutes.

[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:16.740]
By the way, something.

[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:20.280]
Did I hear you say before that you like Ibarcoa or...

[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:20.780]
As a jockey?

[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:22.460]
Ibarcoa.

[01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:23.880]
Ibarcoa, but I mean there's a lot of jockeys.

[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:26.360]
Well they got, since you've been here, they've got cutouts,

[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:28.920]
like really glitzy cutouts of all the jockeys all over the pillars.

[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.180]
Here, where we're at?

[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:30.800]
Yeah.

[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:32.900]
And where we're sitting right under Ibarcoa's.

[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:34.540]
Well I have no idea what he looks like.

[01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:35.920]
I don't think he's a good looking kid.

[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:36.340]
I don't know.

[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:37.240]
I don't think he would either.

[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:37.940]
No.

[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:40.680]
I mean there are some of the jockeys who look like

[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:42.140]
Javier Castellano, for example.

[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:44.360]
I think these cutouts are actually actual size.

[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:46.560]
I could stand up next to them to see how I measure up.

[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:50.040]
And Justin Stein, I wouldn't mind sitting under Justin Stein.

[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:52.800]
He could probably crawl right up on my shoulders.

[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.060]
These are midgits.

[01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:55.960]
You do understand that.

[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:56.260]
I do.

[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:57.660]
I'm in good company here.

[01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:58.500]
They're munchkins.

[01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:00.280]
What a party with them.

[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:00.960]
Make me feel tall.

[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.420]
So you're hanging out under Ibarcoa.

[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.200]
He used to be Ibar.

[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:05.020]
No, now he's Ibar.

[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:05.620]
You're saying Ibarcoa.

[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.020]
I'm sorry.

[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:06.520]
I don't know.

[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:09.380]
He used to be Ibar, E-I-B-A-R, and now he's Ibar.

[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:10.500]
He's wearing polka dots.

[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:11.960]
Oh, how sweet.

[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:13.280]
Evidence-based uniform.

[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.220]
See, tomorrow the race of the Triple Crown starts

[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:17.380]
at Gulf Stream Park with the $250,000

[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:18.760]
Fancy Tipped and Fount of Youth.

[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:21.660]
No misdynations, top three-year-olds battle for supremacy.

[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:24.160]
At Gulf Stream Park, experience unparalleled amenities,

[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:26.320]

[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.240]

[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.620]
and hundreds of seats under the teekies in the brand new

[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:32.980]
Jamison Jockey Club, just a few feet from the rail.

[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:35.080]
And enjoy the best drink specials in town,

[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:38.640]
$1,000,000, to a 24-7, and two-for-one drinks

[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:39.720]
and live entertainment every night.

[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:41.380]
Also, given on the gaming action,

[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:43.040]
where slots are so hot, they have a spread across

[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:46.200]
two casino floors, plus 21 live-action

[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:48.720]
no-limit poker tables means there's a game for everybody.

[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:50.600]
Don't miss your chance to watch and wait you're on the

[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:53.260]
Fancy Tipped and Fount of Youth tomorrow at Gulf Stream Park.

[01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:56.680]
First post-time 115, Gulf Stream Park on Hellendale Beach,

[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:58.040]
Boulevard, and US 1.

[01:37:58.180 --> 01:37:58.880]
Oh, Neil!

[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:00.400]
You're listening to Neil Rogers.

[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:03.080]
It's Friday, you bastard.

[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:10.080]
He's fine until all his big stimulus plan.

[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:14.200]
So we're hoping our future is bright.

[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:18.380]
They were all in mood for recovery.

[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:22.220]
But I'm still broken homeless tonight.

[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:28.000]
I love that.

[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.920]
Short and sweet, right to the point. Don't you love it?

[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:33.060]
Often.

[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:34.360]
Sorry, I had to turn it on.

[01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:35.100]
What?

[01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:36.340]
I forgot it.

[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:38.220]
Hey, Beast, I don't think he's paying any attention to us.

[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:38.700]
It's all right.

[01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:40.420]
It's not good.

[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.320]
No, I'm here.

[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:42.380]
My pot was down.

[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:44.080]
I forgot to turn him on.

[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:45.840]
There's a lot of background chatter.

[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:47.240]
He's got to keep the pot off during the day.

[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:48.260]
You're going to turn him on?

[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:48.900]
Sure.

[01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:50.100]
I sure so.

[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:51.140]
I don't want to be there to see that.

[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:51.880]
Oh boy.

[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:53.180]
Oh, you hear that?

[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.080]
Here come the sirens.

[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:56.040]
You hear them?

[01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:56.780]
They're coming to get us.

[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:00.520]
Now, it's one thing to be chronic and a real A-hole.

[01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:02.460]
It's another thing to be just a pest, Greg Budell.

[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:04.780]
No response, and he sends me the same email again.

[01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:08.380]
About if Brad Beasley was smart, he would do this in 790.

[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:08.600]
Yeah.

[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:10.640]
Same responses I gave you the first time.

[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:10.880]
Yeah.

[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:12.080]
You're a crazy person.

[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.600]
If it's as much we're candy and nuts, we don't have a nice or Christmas.

[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:15.280]
Oh, my.

[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:15.920]
No response?

[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:16.880]
No response?

[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:18.840]
Won't somebody please pay attention to me?

[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:19.620]
I'm Greg Mudell.

[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:21.580]
I used to be a big star and time to cause mine.

[01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:23.840]
No response?

[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:26.600]
Oh, here's the opposed for it for the first race of Tampa.

[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:30.360]
Yeah.

[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.020]
I don't hear anything though.

[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:31.340]
Do you?

[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:32.240]
No.

[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:33.580]
I don't.

[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:35.200]
Well, they're just showing the horses.

[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:36.220]
Maybe they're not playing the audio.

[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:36.740]
I don't know.

[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:39.700]
There's the six heavy chalks, three to five.

[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:45.320]
I guess they've already done the call.

[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:47.640]
Anyway, we got seven minutes to post on it, Tampa Bay.

[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:50.460]
And what do you got going on there?

[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:51.520]
Nothing.

[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:54.280]
Let's see if they're showing the...

[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:55.680]
Now, they're only showing Tampa Bay in Ecuador.

[01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:59.300]
If you're in the United States too early to show the early betting

[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:01.400]
of Gulf Stream for the first race, post on 115.

[01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:05.040]
Scott Levison says, you weren't Saginaw, right?

[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:06.200]
No, I was not in Saginaw.

[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:08.240]
I've never been there and I don't have any desire to go there.

[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:10.400]
I was once in Flint.

[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:15.540]
An old friend of mine used to be a DJ at this rock station in Flint back in...

[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:17.240]
Oh, I'd say, I don't know, late 60s.

[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:19.560]
Mid to late 60s.

[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:21.680]
Ed Christian was his name.

[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:22.880]
Yeah.

[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:23.680]
He was Jewish.

[01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:25.460]
Who did Ed like that?

[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:26.040]
Yeah.

[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:28.060]
But anyway, he worked for...

[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:30.940]
So he slept me up there to watch him do a show one day, you know?

[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:32.960]
To Flint.

[01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:37.820]
Now, if you think you've seen some really depressing places, you know how Michael Moore is always talking about how he's from Flint.

[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:40.180]
And everybody's got to work into places that go astound.

[01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:40.480]
Right.

[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:42.120]
It wasn't so great back then.

[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:48.040]
No, I have never been in Saginaw, but Scott wants to know, is this normal people...

[01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:51.020]
Is this normal people for people in that area?

[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.400]
Carter Novakium judged a sentence swan creek township man in carwash sex case.

[01:40:58.060 --> 01:40:58.660]
What?

[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:05.680]
Jason L. Savage pleaded no contest to indecenix boasha when a sex act involving a Thomas township carwash vacuum.

[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:09.560]
He stuck his goods enough.

[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:09.980]
Chew!

[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:11.460]
Evidently.

[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:12.240]
Yeah.

[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:18.180]
Savage 29 of 11615 swan creek in swan creek township entered the plea this week in Saginaw County Circuit Court.

[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:22.520]
No contest plea means a defendant doesn't contest the prosecutor's evidence and accepts the punishment.

[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:26.280]
Prosecutors greeted dismiss the charge of aggravated indecenix boasha.

[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:28.180]
I guess he was aggravated.

[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:31.580]
Circuit judge Fred Bortchard will sentence him on Wednesday, March 25.

[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.640]
He faces up to a year in jail for a screw in a carwash.

[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:38.480]
Maybe it wasn't consensual.

[01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:42.880]
Savage admitted and courty was on parole for fourth degree fleeing from a police officer.

[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:50.500]
October 14, 2004 Bortchard told Savage the department of corrections could find that he violated terms of his parole by admitting to committing a crime.

[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:57.880]
Court records also show his convictions for a second to get home in invasion, possessing contraband marijuana and yadiotic.

[01:41:58.800 --> 01:41:59.960]
He's done some stuff.

[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:09.100]
The report said a Thomas township resident saw someone acting suspicious at a carwash about 6.45 a.m. October 16 at 7362.

[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:09.640]
Graschard.

[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:10.740]
What?

[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:11.620]
What did you say?

[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:12.380]
Graschard.

[01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:15.180]
That's an even of a major street in Detroit and in Saginaw.

[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:15.740]
How do you like that?

[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:24.340]
A Thomas township police officer parked some distance away approached on foot and caught the man in the act, a sex act involving a carwash vacuum.

[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:26.940]
A real hose job.

[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:28.680]
Cue.

[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:29.480]
How do you like that?

[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:30.920]
That's what they do in Saginaw.

[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:31.380]
Really?

[01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:32.900]
Got a lot of time on her hands.

[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:33.860]
Oh, here's the abugula.

[01:42:33.980 --> 01:42:36.540]
You know, she has races that make her fast enough to win this race.

[01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:37.500]
Oh, he already finished the view.

[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.060]
I don't know the dynamics going to set up.

[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:43.800]
I don't know why they outside in the rail and if she breaks well and blah, blah, blah, and if she digs a big dump.

[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:45.280]
Oh, these are analysts, man.

[01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:45.960]
They just kill me.

[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:48.380]
All the analysts all the time.

[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.000]
That's aqueduct.

[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:52.440]
Only six minutes to the first night.

[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:56.160]
Who cares about aqueduct when we got Tampa coming up in four minutes.

[01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:57.660]
Don't let me forget to play Tampa.

[01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:58.840]
Oh, I wrote it down.

[01:42:59.000 --> 01:42:59.200]
Tampa.

[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:00.260]
And there are.

[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:01.060]
I just want to hear that.

[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.680]
And I still have nobody knows who that is.

[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:06.800]
That's how much of a horse racing a crowd we got out there.

[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:07.460]
Not.

[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:11.120]
Nobody knows the race call or at Tampa Bay.

[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.020]
Well, maybe they know it.

[01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:12.280]
Tampa.

[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:16.380]
Well, here's somebody though who knows about that expression feather in your crap.

[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:16.880]
OK.

[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:19.140]
Let's see what it says.

[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:20.980]
Oh, now is this the beast?

[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:22.900]
Yeah, email the definition.

[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.760]
Oh, you emailed me something before too.

[01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:25.960]
Yeah, it was red bone.

[01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:31.620]
The term feather in your cap is an English idiomatic phrase believed to be derived from a general custom in some cultures.

[01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:34.780]
Of a warrior adding a new feather to their head year for every enemy.

[01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:36.340]
It's like, oh, how is state book eyes?

[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:37.720]
Right?

[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:38.520]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:42.700]
Every time they make like a major play, a big offensive player, a big tackle or something.

[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:44.340]
They put another one of them stars on there.

[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:45.460]
Another book eye on their helmet.

[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:45.940]
Yep.

[01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:47.780]
Is that what they call them?

[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:48.280]
Book eyes?

[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:48.860]
Sure.

[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:50.060]
And they hate them.

[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:50.760]
Book eyes, man.

[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:52.380]
Hate the book eyes.

[01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:56.740]
So anyway, this is from Brian the Beast London on air talent.

[01:43:57.600 --> 01:43:58.320]
It sports radio.

[01:43:58.460 --> 01:43:59.200]
I am the beast.

[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:03.300]
Well, you share for a guy for a tubby guy like you.

[01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:04.540]
You sure about a massive ego?

[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:05.040]
I'll say that.

[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:05.320]
Ha!

[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:13.560]
What?

[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:14.640]
See, there he goes.

[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:15.280]
Good one here again.

[01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:20.440]
What is wrong with you?

[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:24.340]
Sir, sir, don't you feel like there's something wrong with him?

[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:27.100]
He does laugh easy.

[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:27.740]
That's for show.

[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:28.460]
Yeah.

[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:29.480]
Because he's got a bad thing.

[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:31.660]
Wow.

[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:36.340]
How's that pull coming by the way we got 876 vote?

[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:37.940]
I think we got a shot at, I don't know, something.

[01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:40.420]
The shot at the...

[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:42.320]
You are just a mess.

[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:42.980]
A wreck.

[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:47.040]
I thought that once you got married and had a kid and settled down, you might be a little bit more like he...

[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:48.660]
Yeah, that always improves people's situation.

[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:49.240]

[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:53.740]
Well, have you got a bad marriage like George?

[01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:54.260]
No.

[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:55.440]
Just the opposite.

[01:44:56.020 --> 01:44:56.960]
You got a great married.

[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:57.320]
Yeah.

[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:00.540]
In fact, I had anybody married you, I mean, that's...

[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:00.900]
Exactly.

[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:02.840]
I think my lucky stomach...

[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:04.080]
They all have to say that, by the way.

[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:05.500]
You know, all the married guys have to say that.

[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:07.600]
Have to say what?

[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:11.220]
That they have a great marriage and that they love their wives.

[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:11.460]
Why?

[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:13.720]
Trust me, my wife is not listening.

[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:14.520]
She's not your wife?

[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:15.280]
As somebody does.

[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:16.360]
Somebody listens.

[01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:17.280]
No.

[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:18.360]
They're all teachers.

[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:19.320]
They're working.

[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:20.780]
She knows people that listen.

[01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:21.600]
It always gets back into them.

[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:22.260]
What do you mean they?

[01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:24.240]
All of my wife's...

[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:25.020]
Everyone's wife.

[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:30.360]
If they don't listen directly, they have a friend who does and they tell them everything that you say on the radio.

[01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:36.600]
Okay, here's one from the fake Larry King again, who's just like I said, another groupie.

[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:39.320]
Another inside of business groupie.

[01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:40.260]
Some Iod...

[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:41.600]
And probably, I don't know.

[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:45.220]
I really, I really wouldn't even hazard a guest.

[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:47.140]
There's so many lifeless groupies.

[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:48.940]
Who is your favorite former colleague?

[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:50.700]
My guest is Bill Caltor or Phil Henry.

[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:55.320]
You're gonna take a poll.

[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:56.520]
Former colleague.

[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:58.660]
Yeah, let's take a poll on my favorite poll.

[01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:00.180]
And only you get to vote on it.

[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:01.360]
Right, that's a good idea.

[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:02.520]
I vote for Bill Caltor.

[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.300]
Because Bill Caltor was a personal friend of mine.

[01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:05.740]
A good friend.

[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:06.900]
We had a lot of fun at the track.

[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:11.400]
We went to dinner a lot of time with his wife and over at each other's house many, many tents.

[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:12.240]
We socialized.

[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:13.620]
We were friends on and off the air.

[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:16.260]
Phil Henry, I never had a cup of tea with Phil Henry.

[01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:18.680]
Did you?

[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:19.760]
Have you ever go to lunch with Phil?

[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:22.100]
Well, the time that we both did.

[01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:24.040]
We did.

[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:27.040]
Remember after that meeting when he told us some things that weren't true.

[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:27.920]
We were all there together.

[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.420]
He told us some things that weren't true.

[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:35.600]
After that meeting that happened.

[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:38.120]
After that meeting, I think I don't remember going to lunch.

[01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:40.920]
Did we meet next door, let that bar, that place?

[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.560]
Isn't that when that conversation happened?

[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:45.440]
That's when I read that.

[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:48.500]
There was a conversation on the phone saying that they never showed up that night.

[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:50.680]
I thought there was a meeting.

[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:51.720]
Unless I dreamed it.

[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:53.540]
Which was a lie.

[01:46:54.020 --> 01:46:57.100]
The Cox people never showed up that I'd Bob Neal and Bob Green or whatever.

[01:46:57.380 --> 01:46:58.120]
Oh, they never showed up.

[01:46:58.300 --> 01:46:58.800]
Which was a lie.

[01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:03.480]
I mean, you know, I had great respect for his talents back then.

[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:05.060]
And it said when I enjoyed working with him.

[01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:08.240]
But in terms of who is my favorite former colleague, Bill Caltor, not even close.

[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:10.240]
Oh, and here's the race.

[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:11.460]
I missed.

[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:13.460]
And you know who's all that enjoyed.

[01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:14.260]
I'm sure you're right.

[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:15.240]
That's right.

[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:16.480]
Oh, Neal.

[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:17.900]
You're listening to Neal Rogers.

[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:19.840]
It's Fucked To a Friday.

[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:21.140]
You best it.

[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:32.080]
Oh, taco.

[01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:34.500]
What are we gonna do?

[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.720]
I say taco.

[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:38.160]
We are all being screwed.

[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:39.460]
I say livin'.

[01:47:40.460 --> 01:47:41.760]
Why is this happening to us?

[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:46.840]
We want the MCC to get our fun truffles.

[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:50.680]
There's no place for us now, even DJs.

[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:52.760]
Are all down in the mouth.

[01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:53.880]
You can listen.

[01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:00.640]
But now you will find any words that will corrupt your mind.

[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:04.140]
No fun to be.

[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:06.260]
So sorry by the MCC.

[01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:07.820]
No fun to be.

[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:09.820]
That's more by the MCC.

[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.640]
There'll be nothing left.

[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:14.680]
Or else to enjoy it.

[01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:16.500]
We'll soon be playing with children.

[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:18.660]
For I feel fun to be.

[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:20.760]
That's more by the MCC.

[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.240]
No, no fun to be.

[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:24.380]
That's more by the MCC.

[01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:27.080]
They want us to be clean.

[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:28.960]
They think they know what we should feel.

[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:31.780]
They try to dictate to us what is real.

[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:33.800]
Young enough.

[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.240]
Please listen to us.

[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:37.640]
I say, young enough.

[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:39.720]
Please don't put up a fuss.

[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:40.980]
Help us put your hands.

[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:48.240]
The MCC, but you must help us with one thing you'll rather.

[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:50.620]
Can't do it all by yourself.

[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:52.120]
Let's all help him.

[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:54.200]
Don't put it up on the shelf.

[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:55.580]
Let the MCC.

[01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:57.880]
No, just how you feel.

[01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:01.140]
And maybe we'll get this under our square.

[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:02.260]
We feel.

[01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:07.920]
MCC, what are you doing to us?

[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:11.860]
MCC, what are you doing to us?

[01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:14.520]
Our rating was wide.

[01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:16.220]
In fact, I might die.

[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:19.080]
Because of the MCC.

[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:22.340]
You want to band what we can do.

[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:26.000]
MCC, you band what we can do.

[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:46.120]
MCC, you band what we can do.

[01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:55.980]
MCC, you band what we can do.

[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:55.980]

[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:55.980]

[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:55.980]

[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:55.980]

[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:55.980]

[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:55.980]

[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:55.980]

[01:49:55.980 --> 01:50:19.740]
MCC, you band what we can do.

[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:24.340]
MCC, you band what we can do.

[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:24.340]

[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:24.340]

[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:24.340]

[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:24.340]

[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:24.340]

[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:24.340]

[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:24.340]

[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:24.340]

[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:24.340]

[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:24.340]

[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:24.520]
MCC, you band what we can do.

[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:25.600]
MCC, you band what we can do.

[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:25.960]
MCC, you band what we can do.

[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:29.180]
MCC, get off my back.

[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:32.640]
MCC, let us live our lives.

[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:44.720]
MCC, go away.

[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.760]
I was fun at the time.

[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:50.140]
Back in the INZ days.

[01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:53.220]
That's what I learned by lessons, man.

[01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:55.860]
No more campaigns, no more any of that.

[01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:57.680]
I'm going to change the world.

[01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:58.780]
It's just it's a radio show.

[01:50:58.880 --> 01:50:59.220]
That's all.

[01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:00.940]
I'm going to change the world on the radio.

[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:05.380]
I'm like some people think, oh yeah, they're going to change the world.

[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:06.640]
We are the world.

[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:10.240]
Somebody says Ed Bill, where there's now green of the list, thanks.

[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:10.740]
No chance.

[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:13.520]
The list is closed that it didn't.

[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.340]
So, I've got canned again, huh?

[01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:18.320]
The word.

[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:19.100]
The word.

[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:21.760]
Now, is it official or is it like still?

[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:23.160]
We didn't get the press release.

[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:24.460]
Haha.

[01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:34.280]
God, what one would think that you harbor a grudges against the molman.

[01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:38.160]
This because he tried to get you fired and George and me and everybody else.

[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:41.740]
890 votes on the pool very soon will be over 900.

[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:46.020]
An honor of Black History Month, which late, great Black Entertainer.

[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:49.480]
Do you miss the most Jimmy Hendricks 160? Richard Prior 142.

[01:51:50.740 --> 01:52:00.600]
run away for them. After that, small potatoes, red Fox 88, Ray Charles 52. Let's see, let's look down. Two-packed shickers got 14.

[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:17.380]
Bob Marley is up to 11. Gregory's high knees got 11. And who else? Well, there's only 6000 names. I hear Syrovon still don't have one. Tammy Terell's got one.

[01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:29.900]
Eartha Kitt's got a pair. Her earth claim the fame was used to bite people on the lip. Really? Eartha Kitt? She was a crazy bitch. I heard this. I didn't know about that.

[01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:38.340]
I think she bit Johnny Mantras on the lip. You remember Johnny? I can see why he would have a problem with that. Yeah.

[01:52:40.600 --> 01:53:08.200]
He said it was the wasn't the first time he was vid, but first time by chicken, first time on the lights. Yeah. So what do you think? About what? By the way, Richard Grunder? Is that an answer? Richard Dundee? Oh, Grunder is an answer to Tampa. And we missed the start of the race that this is big. Sorry. I suck. Who told you that? Steve Steve's load. I see found out from inside. That's right. I'm sure Steve didn't know that. Actually what?

[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:38.180]
I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that

[01:53:38.180 --> 01:54:08.160]
I didn't know that I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I wasn't getting there and I didn't know that.

[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:12.580]
higher. I don't know. It is. It is. But especially now that it's only a ten

[01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:16.280]
hours feel I bet the one two ten over the eleven five dollar doubles and

[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:18.920]
then that's it and then if you're alive if one of your three horses wins a

[01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:22.300]
first race then you don't have to bet again the second race. Okay. So that

[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:24.980]
means your maximum punch and you'd still be ahead of the game because you got

[01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:29.320]
that money that surely slipped to you. Right. Well that's my budget. My budget

[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:33.580]
pretty box. Well she's a nice lady. What kind of crazy person would bring you

[01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:38.180]
money. I guess the crazy yes. God. She's a sweetheart. By the way your friends

[01:54:38.180 --> 01:54:43.760]
that check when in the mail yesterday regular mail. What do you laugh at about it?

[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:47.920]
Nothing. It went in a mail. He'll have it at the beginning of the week when he's

[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:51.820]
supposed to have it. Should have said it irregular mail. Yeah. Oh thanks for

[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:56.320]
air-nighting and it overnighting. Yeah. Thanks thanks this. He's lucky as hell I

[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:59.240]
didn't reduce him by 50%. That's what I should have done. Everybody else is

[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:04.420]
getting the cut. How come he didn't get a pay cut? Chicken neck. Yeah. How come?

[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:10.840]
Because I'm a hell of a guy that's why I'm meant for all ages and because I'm

[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:14.260]
trying to temper the amount of my cash it was a little dwindling amount I have

[01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:20.700]
left that the Paco can waste can throw down the toilet. Trading two children for a

[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:24.340]
bird land of three people in jail in Louisiana authority say what kind of bird

[01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:29.600]
We'll get to it. All right. It's important. The biological mother who was not

[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:32.020]
involved in the alleged trade is to be interviewed by authorities today.

[01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:37.100]
Investigations are going on and deferred the details about a case they say on

[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:42.020]
full to this way. Paul and Brandy Romero advertised they were selling their pet

[01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:48.660]
cockatoo for 1,500 bucks. Well you see how that yeah. A woman named Donna Greenwell

[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:52.680]
responded and she said she wanted to buy the bird. Greenwell then told Romero

[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:56.200]
that she was taking care of the three children whose biological parents were

[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.080]
going through a separation. Greenwell proposed selling two of the couples

[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:02.900]
children to the Romero's for two grand saying that her job as truck driver is

[01:56:02.900 --> 01:56:04.480]
and makes it hard to take care of the children.

[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:09.840]
So Captain Keith Duprey of the Evangelion Perth, Purrusha Sheriff's Office in

[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:14.560]
Louisiana. An honest tips to contact authorities after the children began

[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:17.860]
living with the Romero's as a result Greenwell and the Romero's were arrested

[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:21.900]
February 21 and charged with aggravated kidnapping. The children were

[01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:24.480]
well taken care when they were the were the Romero's who badly wanted children

[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:27.960]
to do. Greenwell said she needed the cash for a lawyer to handle adoption

[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:31.820]
paperwork. She had placed a third child with another Louisiana couple but

[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:33.520]
didn't know whether bartering was involved.

[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:40.700]
She traded these two kids for a cockatoo. The two children were ages four and

[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:44.600]
five according to CNN affiliate WGNO. Police didn't identify the biological

[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:47.280]
parents. The other information was available. Children were in place in

[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:53.840]
foster care. Oh everybody makes babies at the world in which we live. Everybody can make babies.

[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:56.860]
They say what they were planted to do with those children like eat them or something?

[01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:09.120]
No that's the cockatoo I thought. Oh Tampa Bay Downs I apologize profusely.

[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:15.400]
What happened? Somebody sent me an email. See sometimes there's a delay on these

[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:22.660]
we've discovered. Like there's a delay on this thing coming up at all. It's just now.

[01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:26.340]
You said you were looking for the announcer to have a bay down after checking Google

[01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:33.080]
the name Richard Grunder pops up a lot. Well that's because that's his name.

[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.500]
Joe Judge Gulfstream picks this out of me because this this outlook expresses really pissing me off.

[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:44.380]
Is there some reason why it slows down like this sometimes other times it's like like lightning?

[01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:49.460]
I don't know. What an effing blast your Friday second race is a Gulfstream.

[01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:53.900]
I'm probably biased about this because I'm a horse racing fan. I stayed in the car in the

[01:57:53.900 --> 01:58:00.560]
parking lot of Gulfstream because the one time I was there the bomb came in three out of four

[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:04.340]
fun stuff to do whatever whatever that must be when that one horse came in that thirty to one shot.

[01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:13.700]
Remember that? Yep. That was bad. And our horse the six horse that race came in second. What a

[01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:18.520]
trim tire pucker also gives me the name of the well that's not how he spells it but that's not

[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:23.980]
I don't think Larry King is back. He's got some comment about that FCC song. You should add what

[01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:29.600]
does it say? Must be very important. They must have been that must have been during the Sofar

[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:33.220]
campaign. 94 news W. I. Z. It would be nice. If you had a good technical guy riding you can

[01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:43.680]
transfer all those real to real tapes and made this to MP3. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The Nileys would

[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:46.300]
you have anfield year sister Nileys et Breeze paper

[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:47.500]
That ain't it.

[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:51.860]
I

[01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:55.860]
Hey!

[01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:38.040]
Somebody!

[01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:38.700]
Somebody!

[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:40.260]
Somebody!

[01:59:41.780 --> 01:59:42.280]
Somebody!

[01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:43.380]

[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:44.040]
Somebody!

[01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:44.180]
Somebody!

[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:44.540]
Somebody!

[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:49.420]
Somebody!

[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:51.700]
Somebody!

[01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:54.000]
Somebody!

[01:59:56.620 --> 01:59:59.940]
Alright, and now one single even a raspberry in that whole bit.

[02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:00.920]
And now are we proud of that?

[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:01.280]
Yes.

[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:03.140]
How are we embarrassed in the shame?

[02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:04.560]
14 to 11 at QAAM.

[02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:07.280]
We got the big first race from Gulf Street in a half an hour.

[02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:09.680]
And then race two, that's the one.

[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:11.940]
That's the pick the pony deal.

[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:15.200]
And what's our contestants name? Malcolm?

[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:15.920]
Morris.

[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:17.420]
Mauris the Cat.

[02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:21.320]
And we got 50 bucks to win on the 11th horse in the second race.

[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:22.460]
What's the name of the horse again?

[02:00:22.940 --> 02:00:23.920]
Dr. Bojangles.

[02:00:25.580 --> 02:00:27.100]
Mr. Professor Rushmenderick.

[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:27.820]
What is it?

[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:29.240]
I don't know, Mr. Mr.

[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:32.220]
I got it here in my Mr. Dr. Professor.

[02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:36.960]
That's like that Dr. Professor of Henry Finklstein that

[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:39.280]
waits to us all the time that I block, because I'm sick of his crap.

[02:00:40.860 --> 02:00:43.140]
Some of these people just, they just don't get it.

[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:44.600]
They do not get it.

[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:48.440]
They think that once you read one of their pieces of

[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:51.500]
direct, that it's just, it's an invitation to just keep sending

[02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:54.300]
4,000 emails, like being in a chat room.

[02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:56.400]
George.

[02:00:56.780 --> 02:00:58.280]
Oh, I'm sorry I was the appendicitis of it.

[02:00:58.280 --> 02:00:58.900]
Yeah, but you were.

[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:00.260]
I was reading the plan.

[02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:01.200]
What did you get from Longies?

[02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:03.780]
I had, I had a Maiden Oce.

[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:05.440]
A Maiden Oce?

[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:08.700]
A Maiden Oce, a Cuban saying what you know with all the pork and the hand.

[02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:10.140]
Do you have a Mojito with it?

[02:01:10.380 --> 02:01:11.480]
I did not have any Mojito.

[02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:12.120]
I kept it dry.

[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:13.140]
No.

[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.460]
Hey Steve Roddenero is back.

[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:17.580]
He says, hello sir.

[02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:19.940]
Sally fits once to the store on Earth a kid.

[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:23.560]
She told Sally about how she bit Bert Ward on the set of the Batman show.

[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:24.960]
I wonder where she bit him.

[02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:25.380]
Huh?

[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:26.540]
Bert did not bite back.

[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:28.760]
Sally also reported that Adam West had a sissy fit.

[02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:30.020]
I would, I wouldn't be surprised.

[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:31.360]
I'd have been jealous too.

[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:34.360]
Especially if she bit him anywhere near those green tights.

[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:38.960]
I mean, I've heard of that pistol packing mama stuff.

[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:40.660]
I think that was Ethel Merman, wasn't it?

[02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:42.380]
What was Bert packing?

[02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:45.420]
I don't know, but his sure wore those tights.

[02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:46.020]
So awfully tight.

[02:01:46.020 --> 02:01:47.680]
I'm pretty sure they had him stuffed, you know.

[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:51.180]
If you ever watched that movie that I gave you, which was horrible.

[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:55.800]
I don't know, I think the parts that are horrible, you got to sift through.

[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:59.260]
Because every time they do a flashback, then they do get into all of those things like, yes.

[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:02.600]
He did stuff his thing or he didn't do whatever.

[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:04.020]
The movie goes into it.

[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:04.460]
Really?

[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:08.900]
A lot back on years ago, you know, when Bert Ward looked really, really, uh...

[02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:11.820]
They had to pat it because it was very discreet when it wasn't.

[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:12.500]
Pat it.

[02:02:12.860 --> 02:02:13.220]
Really?

[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:15.000]
In other words, it showed too much of it.

[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:16.220]
Showed what his religion was?

[02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:19.600]
Tap a bait down second race in one minute.

[02:02:19.740 --> 02:02:20.420]
Now don't let me forget.

[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:22.020]
We got plenty of time before the break.

[02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:24.780]
So we can hear what's his name again?

[02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:25.840]
Robert Grundy.

[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:26.580]
Robert Grundy.

[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:30.580]
I wonder if he's kind to die in and see more Grundy from Michigan, who used to own a bunch of horses.

[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.340]
In the Gordy North Stable.

[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:33.200]
See my trivia?

[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:35.720]
I know stuff man that people don't want to know.

[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:37.460]
Especially the audience.

[02:02:40.660 --> 02:02:41.460]
Yoshi Schmendrich says...

[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:47.140]
This guy calls right before your show because he knows that when I'm always talking about stormy,

[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:48.340]
he calls everybody at the same time.

[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:50.540]
He says that's when most people listen.

[02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:51.600]
He never says anything.

[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:53.480]
Just block his big ass, big dog.

[02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:54.140]
It's embarrassing.

[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:55.280]
Go away storm cat.

[02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:56.180]
Says Yoshi.

[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:00.340]
He says good luck with picked the ponies today.

[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:01.760]
I'll be down there plunging my guts out.

[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:02.820]
So helping you, God.

[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:04.820]
PS Georgia, I just got some blaze, man.

[02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:06.080]
I can bring you a nug if you want.

[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:07.000]
I'm good.

[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:07.500]
Just thanks.

[02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:08.620]
Just let me know if you want.

[02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:11.920]
I know you're at work so it's, don't know if this is appropriate.

[02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:12.880]
Well why the hell not?

[02:03:13.420 --> 02:03:13.800]
That's alright.

[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:14.580]
I'm good.

[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:15.880]
You heard the old ropeadoop.

[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:17.580]
Why not the old smokeadoop right on the ear?

[02:03:17.700 --> 02:03:18.660]
Yoshi Schmendrich says.

[02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:20.060]
So keep an eye out for Yoshi.

[02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:24.860]
But unlike Shirley, he's not going to bring you no 40 bucks.

[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:27.360]
That's sweet.

[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:32.380]
All of the fake Russo aces has sent a news article.

[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:32.820]

[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.060]
Wow, that's a first.

[02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:38.160]
He says, high kneels, some of the queens in your audience

[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:39.400]
will know who Wendy Richard was.

[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:41.660]
In reference to the guitarist from Pylon who died,

[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:43.560]
Pylon was right alongside REM.

[02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:48.340]
In the birth of the college radio music scene in the early 80s,

[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:50.100]
both were Athens, Joe, Japan's,

[02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:53.060]
and REM has covered Pylon, Sons and Concerts many, many times.

[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:55.640]
For whatever it's worth, which is probably not much.

[02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:58.700]
British actress Wendy Richard, dead at 65.

[02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:00.380]
How do you like that?

[02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:01.240]
Alright.

[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:03.980]
I wonder if she's kind of Keith Richard.

[02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:05.280]
A little Richard?

[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:06.480]
Beer through a straw.

[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:07.560]
So I don't have to move my microphone.

[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:08.780]
Are you doing what?

[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:11.180]
I'm drinking beer through a straw.

[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:13.000]
You're drinking beer through a straw.

[02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:14.760]
So that I don't have to move with a microphone.

[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:16.120]
My headset.

[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:18.220]
I would have thought they'd brought you a mojito.

[02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:20.540]
I could.

[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:23.040]
Oh, here's the second racer to Tampa Bay Downs.

[02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:24.080]
Hey, don't forget.

[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:25.000]
Quiet.

[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:27.080]
They're all in.

[02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:29.440]
I think.

[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:32.000]
Looks like it.

[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:33.480]
And.

[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:34.520]
Come on, though.

[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:37.740]
They're not all in.

[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:41.140]
Mother close to all in the outside.

[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:42.060]
Hoss is going in.

[02:04:42.580 --> 02:04:43.940]
Quit dittling around and get in there.

[02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:48.200]
Oh, this is the part I keep telling you this all the time.

[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:48.440]
And I'll.

[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:49.100]
To go in.

[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:50.140]
Oh, two more to try.

[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:50.520]
Rich.

[02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:51.840]
I hate from the outside.

[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:53.200]
Extreme measure.

[02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:55.220]
Get him in there.

[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.660]
Smack him in the ass and get him in there.

[02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:02.500]
Rappen with some brass knuckles real hard and get him in the gate.

[02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:08.000]
Extreme measure of the last to move forward.

[02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:08.560]
Yeah.

[02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:10.380]
And.

[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:11.360]
They're off.

[02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:12.500]
They're about to post.

[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:13.720]
And.

[02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:14.460]
Come on up.

[02:05:18.700 --> 02:05:19.220]
And.

[02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:23.980]
And.

[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:26.760]
And.

[02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:26.900]
And.

[02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:28.020]
They're off.

[02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:30.560]
Control is the way.

[02:05:30.580 --> 02:05:31.420]
The usual.

[02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:34.400]
He lost a little bit of enthusiasm there, whether we're dittling around I guess.

[02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:35.340]
That was okay though.

[02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:36.920]
Bury cat.

[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:38.140]
Moves through.

[02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:39.860]
Okay, don't get all excited now.

[02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:41.860]
Morris or anybody else because this is Tampa Bay downs.

[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:44.300]
We wouldn't bet on these horses with Georgia's money.

[02:05:48.220 --> 02:05:52.080]
Anthony and Tamarack sends me a whole long thing about the school board in Broward County

[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:57.240]
and making a school day for four four days a week instead of a five days and

[02:05:57.240 --> 02:05:57.640]
et cetera.

[02:05:57.860 --> 02:05:59.340]
Nobody cares about education Anthony.

[02:05:59.480 --> 02:05:59.840]
I'm sorry.

[02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:04.680]
He says why are these same people who should be standing by the teachers in the

[02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:05.820]
time when our votes really matter?

[02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:11.140]
Whatever I'm missing all the middle parts here because it goes on forever.

[02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:11.860]
Yeah.

[02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:15.240]
This is why I hate sports as Anthony millions of people remember these super bowl

[02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:16.080]
commercials every year.

[02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:19.380]
But who remembers last time that when they didn't cut our school budgets annually?

[02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:21.240]
Well, guess what Anthony?

[02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:22.680]
That's the country in which you live.

[02:06:23.020 --> 02:06:24.120]
What's one got to do with the other?

[02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:27.560]
I just thought I mentioned this to try to stir up some support for our dying education system.

[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:29.040]
Hope you enjoy the great weekend.

[02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:30.600]
Well, we are simple.

[02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:30.860]
Wow.

[02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:31.920]
Anthony, we're all for you.

[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:34.220]
From the law for an educated populist.

[02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:34.640]
What?

[02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:37.220]
Trying to drum up support almost that my beer up.

[02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:38.200]
Did you really?

[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:38.800]
Yeah.

[02:06:39.260 --> 02:06:39.720]
I'll have to.

[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:42.320]
Yeah, drum up this.

[02:06:42.460 --> 02:06:43.340]
New York solution.

[02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:44.700]
And deep stretch.

[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:46.240]
It's trial, rich in front.

[02:06:46.780 --> 02:06:47.500]
Brave Troy.

[02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:48.920]
Trying to come back for a second.

[02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:50.340]
Here's a four wins by open line.

[02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:52.460]
By steel train, but down to the wire.

[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:53.420]
Down to the wire.

[02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:54.460]
To the reds to score.

[02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:55.560]
And the shadow of the wire.

[02:06:55.680 --> 02:06:59.260]
You know what really frost my ass about a lot of race most race announces?

[02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:00.040]
What's that?

[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:04.760]
They steal stuff from other announcers and the one line that almost all of them have stolen from Tom Durkin,

[02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:09.620]
which is from the great races between easy go and Sunday silence.

[02:07:11.060 --> 02:07:12.560]
One final acceleration.

[02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:14.220]
That's from that great comment.

[02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:15.080]
Will you stay up that on cart?

[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:15.600]
Yep.

[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:18.440]
And you could hear Durkin's cheer squeaking because he weighs 600 pounds?

[02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:19.440]
Really?

[02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:20.900]
Yeah, he's like the beast.

[02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:23.380]
So speaking of racing, is that what we're going to do?

[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:23.560]
Yes.

[02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:25.180]
Because Steve's going to go better in this next break.

[02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:27.200]
The one two and ten of the 11.

[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:27.500]

[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:29.120]
Do this next break.

[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:29.920]
You should be waiting.

[02:07:30.580 --> 02:07:31.400]
Well, I'll tell you right now.

[02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:31.900]
Okay.

[02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:33.560]
You're betting 15 bucks.

[02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:34.180]
Okay.

[02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:37.260]
Five dollar doubles, one two and ten over the 11.

[02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:37.860]
Got it.

[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:39.640]
Got it.

[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:40.680]
I'm waiting for the 11.

[02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:42.520]
Is that how it's, is that what I say?

[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:44.360]
One, two, ten.

[02:07:44.820 --> 02:07:45.580]
Over the 11.

[02:07:45.780 --> 02:07:46.520]
Got it.

[02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:49.540]
Which my confidence on the 11 is very, I don't know.

[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:50.920]
And you know something else?

[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:52.460]
Depends on how much you want to bet.

[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:53.400]
I do.

[02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:54.260]
I want to bet some more.

[02:07:55.160 --> 02:07:59.080]
Bet two dollar doubles, one two and ten over the eight is a saver.

[02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:01.920]
Now we can't do a saver for our contestant because I can only pick one horse.

[02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:03.320]
But for you, we can do it.

[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:03.520]

[02:08:04.220 --> 02:08:04.780]
Over the eight.

[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:07.220]
And then of course, if the eight wins, you'll collect and the more it will be upset.

[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:08.180]
But what am I going to do?

[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:10.780]
You know, confidence is very marginal in that 11 horse.

[02:08:11.780 --> 02:08:13.200]
Especially knowing that that knucklehead.

[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:14.720]
I mean, that great to the handicap or there.

[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:16.780]
Ron Nicoletti picked it a gallstream.

[02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:19.600]
He's got that real new yaw key thing.

[02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:21.720]
Yeah, that kind of puts me off in the yaw key thing.

[02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:21.900]
Yeah.

[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:23.860]
Like the ranges ranges.

[02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:28.640]
The ranges don't just lose, I mean, they lose every day.

[02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:35.340]
When you lose to the Leafs twice in three days, then you know you really are stinkin' the joint out.

[02:08:35.660 --> 02:08:37.040]
That's what John Tortellini told me.

[02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:40.480]
He said, and look at this.

[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:42.880]
Here's somebody with an attachment, a link, a whole bunch of stuff.

[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:43.780]
And guess what I just did?

[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:44.280]

[02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:45.840]
Delete, delete, delete.

[02:08:46.220 --> 02:08:47.000]
What do you mean, delete?

[02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:48.020]
When you click delete.

[02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:50.960]
I am bonus bandero.

[02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:53.680]
Since fearless leader has won the Tasha and I know,

[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:55.520]
I have to look for a motion squarer.

[02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:59.400]
Instead, we listen to the neo-roger's fairer and balanced one to two hour.

[02:09:03.820 --> 02:09:05.620]
The Middle Eastern world.

[02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:12.360]
We'll be exploded to dumb at people killed with the gas that we sold him.

[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:16.300]
First time aggressor nation and the only one that's growing.

[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:20.660]
Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing.

[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:25.640]
Forget about Korea and the nooks there toe to that butt.

[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:32.120]
Right wing is drilling it over and over and to our hips.

[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:38.500]
That Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:51.620]
3000 people killed.

[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:55.240]
Are now forgotten, let's exploit them instead.

[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:57.720]
Hey, there's oil to be gotten.

[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:14.680]
The Middle Eastern world.

[02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:16.220]
We're going to be destroyed.

[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:16.220]

[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:16.220]

[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:16.220]

[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:16.220]

[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:16.220]

[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:16.220]

[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:16.220]

[02:10:16.380 --> 02:10:16.880]
We're going to be destroyed.

[02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:17.860]
We're going to be destroyed.

[02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:18.920]
We're going to be destroyed.

[02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:19.780]
We're going to be destroyed.

[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:22.660]
We're going to be destroyed.

[02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:23.520]
We're going to be destroyed.

[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:23.760]
We're going to be destroyed.

[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:25.180]
We're going to be destroyed.

[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:27.640]
We're going to be destroyed.

[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:31.780]
Yes, some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:46.680]
The loss of civil rights is the rise that we're paying.

[02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:50.660]
We're all suspects now, not the ash croft is saying.

[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:52.660]
I have nothing to hide.

[02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:54.860]
Table talkers all are saying.

[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:58.780]
Blind obedience, cattle don't have any reservations.

[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:02.660]
Bout a provoked battle, that world annihilation.

[02:11:03.580 --> 02:11:06.920]
Old regimes must fall in half a virgin and skull.

[02:11:07.320 --> 02:11:09.180]
With no objection at all.

[02:11:09.540 --> 02:11:17.000]
Democraft don't have the balls and the right wing is drilling it over and over and over.

[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.340]
It's too operating, watch, head.

[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:24.720]
I rack has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:32.940]
You're fairly only I rack has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:41.060]
Well, I think I made three good choices for in that first race.

[02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:43.600]
Good. Everybody else.

[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:44.220]
Everybody here.

[02:11:44.300 --> 02:11:44.940]
That by the way.

[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:45.760]
I'm making fun.

[02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:47.840]
Everybody here made the same bets as I did.

[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:48.480]
Oh, great.

[02:11:48.940 --> 02:11:49.820]
The one is 10 to one.

[02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:52.400]
The two is six to five favorite and the what's the other one?

[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:53.900]
The 10 is a seven to two.

[02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:54.460]
Third choice.

[02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:56.820]
The 12 is getting action is three to one.

[02:11:58.120 --> 02:11:59.200]
Second time starter.

[02:11:59.460 --> 02:11:59.920]
Uh oh.

[02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:02.080]
With Josef Escano no less.

[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:02.840]
Uh oh.

[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:04.340]
Great red feather.

[02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:06.760]
Uh oh.

[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:08.160]
Yeah.

[02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:09.720]
Anyway, I don't like him.

[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:12.220]
Camp at him.

[02:12:12.220 --> 02:12:12.800]
I mean, you can.

[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:14.080]
You could bet him all, but you know.

[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:15.960]
We don't want to do that.

[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:18.740]
So everybody what do you mean everybody made the same bet?

[02:12:18.900 --> 02:12:19.320]
What does that mean?

[02:12:19.780 --> 02:12:20.500]
What does that mean?

[02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:20.500]

[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:21.500]
You stalker.

[02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:22.000]
Why is that?

[02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:23.600]
I know something.

[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:24.740]
No, nobody does.

[02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:26.080]
You think you've been hit.

[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:26.900]
This race.

[02:12:27.220 --> 02:12:28.840]
I'm shocked that the one is 10 to one.

[02:12:30.700 --> 02:12:31.060]
Macromy.

[02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:31.780]
Yeah.

[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:34.740]
Is that the one you said you like the name?

[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:35.280]
Yeah.

[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:38.380]
And look to me like he was going to be a kind of a short price.

[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:39.400]
But he's 10 to one.

[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:41.360]
Maybe win for a fun.

[02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:43.120]
Wouldn't a one 11 be a nice double.

[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:45.940]
Yeah.

[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:46.900]
It would be.

[02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:47.460]
Yeah.

[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:48.420]
Can't wait.

[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:49.020]
Huh.

[02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:50.180]
I'm all stoked.

[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:51.140]
Okay.

[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:52.160]
Well, let me get back to the emails.

[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:53.800]
Even though I know you hit them like poison now.

[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:55.740]
Beast is with us today.

[02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:56.700]
Flea is out there.

[02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:57.380]
A ditto and around.

[02:12:58.060 --> 02:12:59.220]
Did the flea flea flea.

[02:12:59.220 --> 02:13:00.040]
A flea man bet that too?

[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:00.820]
I don't know.

[02:13:03.220 --> 02:13:04.460]
He's running around like you said.

[02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:05.680]
He's what?

[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:06.920]
He's running around like you said.

[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:07.460]
He's running around.

[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:09.040]
Are they showing the horses?

[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:11.020]
He's watching the what he caught?

[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:12.020]
The little parade there.

[02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:12.820]
The post parade?

[02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:14.680]
No, the people walking in the walking ring.

[02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:15.120]
That's it.

[02:13:15.340 --> 02:13:15.720]
There he is.

[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:17.420]
Did you bet this with us?

[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:17.560]
Lee?

[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:20.140]
No, he did not.

[02:13:21.300 --> 02:13:21.980]
What do you bet?

[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:24.560]
He bet that we're all going to lose our ass.

[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:26.120]
Well, what do you bet?

[02:13:26.340 --> 02:13:27.080]
He didn't bet anything.

[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:29.280]
Oh, well, that's because he's cheap for Christ's sakes.

[02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:31.540]
That's because you got to take a paint cut to be the assistant PD.

[02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:34.180]
The assistant, you heard that?

[02:13:34.780 --> 02:13:35.480]
I heard it.

[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:36.140]
Yeah.

[02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:38.020]
Beast charting and puking.

[02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:40.660]
Assistant to his boyfriend.

[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:41.300]
Oh, my God.

[02:13:41.300 --> 02:13:45.800]
Does he have also duties involving the beast since he's the assistant PD now?

[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:47.280]
He's a backup.

[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:48.160]
Yeah.

[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:49.060]
Oh, I bet.

[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:50.180]
I believe it.

[02:13:50.180 --> 02:13:50.580]
Correct him.

[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:50.880]
Yeah.

[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:52.660]
Beast has the back that ass.

[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:52.960]
Whoa.

[02:13:56.520 --> 02:13:56.960]
Exactly.

[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:00.080]
Sal says last week, George said it.

[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:01.600]
Now, you said it this week several times.

[02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:04.480]
It is something that's a slap in the face to your listeners, Uncle Neil.

[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:06.120]
Slap in the face.

[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:07.880]
Sorry.

[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:10.380]
You said it now once but twice.

[02:14:10.380 --> 02:14:12.100]
Why would anyone listen to talk radio?

[02:14:13.340 --> 02:14:14.140]
Did I say that?

[02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:14.760]
No.

[02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:15.800]
I don't even know.

[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:17.800]
You don't have to have no life to listen to talk radio.

[02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:18.920]
That isn't what I said at all.

[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:23.780]
But then again, most of you are real experts and twisting our words and coming up with crap that we never said in the first place.

[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:27.320]
I was talking about chronics.

[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:28.140]
Chronics.

[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:28.460]
Right.

[02:14:29.220 --> 02:14:30.580]
There's a difference between listening.

[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:36.320]
It's just like the difference between the being a sports fan and watching ball games or talking games or whatever and being a chronic.

[02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:39.200]
And that's the, those are the emails I was talking about for what it's worth.

[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:39.840]
What?

[02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:40.760]
This whole thing.

[02:14:41.260 --> 02:14:41.420]
It's like, what?

[02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:41.920]
Yeah, all the things.

[02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:42.800]
But it's fun.

[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:45.160]
You take it so serious for crying out loud.

[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:45.360]
I do that.

[02:14:45.580 --> 02:14:47.180]
I take it so it boards the hell out of me.

[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:48.360]
What a slap in the face.

[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:49.500]
I tell you a slap in the face.

[02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:51.480]
You're audience who, by the way, supported you all these years.

[02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:55.280]
When you say the listeners suck and the emailers are dreadful, I think to myself, what the heck?

[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:57.060]
What am I doing with my life and time, then?

[02:14:57.580 --> 02:14:58.860]
When did I ever say the listeners suck?

[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:03.520]
Remember one thing, Neil and George, we are the mouths that feed you indirectly, maybe.

[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:05.080]
We are the mouths that feed you.

[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:07.500]
I thought only birds got fed by mouth.

[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:08.080]
Maybe.

[02:15:08.620 --> 02:15:09.780]
Your emails are terminal?

[02:15:10.100 --> 02:15:10.700]
No way, baby.

[02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:12.720]
The only thing terminal is you're reading polls and emails.

[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:19.360]
Whenever you blow money on skates and silly gambling, it's us to fans who are funding this by listening to, like, loyal fools that we are.

[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:21.760]
You're welcome, George and Neil.

[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:22.720]
Way to thank the fans.

[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:24.320]
No more listening to your show for me.

[02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:27.140]
After all, what kind of loser listen to talk radio? Right, Neil?

[02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:29.900]
No, what kind of loser writes a bunch of crap like this?

[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:31.220]
A bunch of phony crap.

[02:15:32.340 --> 02:15:33.980]
Well, here's the post-barrage, Shawke.

[02:15:33.980 --> 02:15:42.980]
There's not a whole lot standing in the way in this first race, which is a maiden clamor or $15,000 for Philly's Amers, that sees number two disperse.

[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:46.560]
Oh my god, the professor sends me a caustic email.

[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:48.560]
I didn't know Ed Kaplan was filling in for you today.

[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:49.720]
It's our regular Friday.

[02:15:49.820 --> 02:15:51.580]
It's a paid promotion on the show, okay?

[02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:52.280]
Professor.

[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:53.400]
At level on the dirt.

[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:54.660]
And that was really sharp.

[02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:55.680]
But that was against me.

[02:15:55.940 --> 02:15:57.760]
Professor Wade Competition on the turf.

[02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:03.140]
Ian Wilkes, ready to hope for this bullet mile out of the gate of Palm Meadows.

[02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:07.580]
Makes me think the horse is feeling well, certainly spotted at the $15,000 level.

[02:16:07.700 --> 02:16:12.580]
So it looks like the one to be currently on the board at a stroke for as we say in France.

[02:16:12.700 --> 02:16:13.300]
Even money.

[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:14.480]
And we're right.

[02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:18.020]
Of course Wilkes and let Peru will be looking forward to a big weekend.

[02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:19.540]
Perhaps in the fountain of youth tomorrow.

[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:23.000]
They'll send out Captain Candyman, can together.

[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:24.200]
But I mean, but I'm up.

[02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:24.960]
I'm up.

[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:26.920]
All these handicaps are all the time.

[02:16:27.460 --> 02:16:28.240]
So they're coming out there.

[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:28.820]
Are you seeing them?

[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:30.480]
Are you sitting where you can see the horses?

[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:30.860]
Yeah.

[02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:31.820]
Really?

[02:16:31.820 --> 02:16:33.520]
I mean, they're all out there.

[02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:35.620]
The one to still tend to win the two is even money favorite.

[02:16:35.780 --> 02:16:37.460]
And the 10 is seven to two.

[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:38.480]
Co-third choice.

[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:41.540]
So it's not like I picked you a bunch of stiffs.

[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:42.940]
I'll figure that out.

[02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:43.620]
No, I feel it really good.

[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:46.160]
Now two of the three choices and a little bit of a price there.

[02:16:46.260 --> 02:16:46.720]
It was a good price.

[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:47.700]
11 of one on the one.

[02:16:48.060 --> 02:16:48.760]
Two of six to five.

[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:50.360]
Who's getting the late money that damn 12.

[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:52.240]
The damn 12.

[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:56.300]
Now if you want to cover yourself, you might want to bet another two bucks.

[02:16:56.300 --> 02:16:57.160]
And I want to like a.

[02:16:57.760 --> 02:16:58.540]
Gleen you dry here.

[02:16:59.020 --> 02:16:59.340]
I'm good.

[02:16:59.340 --> 02:17:02.760]
You might want to have Steve go back to a $2 double 12 11.

[02:17:03.900 --> 02:17:05.160]
Just to cover your ass.

[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:08.340]
They got it if he were here.

[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:10.320]
He's not there.

[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:10.700]
He's not.

[02:17:10.900 --> 02:17:11.540]
I don't know where he went.

[02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:12.040]
That's all right.

[02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:12.620]
I'm good with these.

[02:17:13.940 --> 02:17:14.940]
I'm telling you.

[02:17:15.980 --> 02:17:16.860]
Taking late money.

[02:17:17.460 --> 02:17:17.780]
Yeah.

[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:24.180]
I don't know if I if I give money to what it means is when they start betting on it means he's alive.

[02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:24.540]
He's.

[02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:29.400]
I give money to Lee and tell him hey, go bet the 12 11 double.

[02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:30.840]
They'll know what he's talking about at the window.

[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:31.960]
Yeah, give him two bucks.

[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:32.460]
Okay.

[02:17:32.700 --> 02:17:33.120]
Hey Lee.

[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:39.560]
Go bet the 12 11 double $2 double $2 double $2 double $12 11 double.

[02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:41.300]
He can handle it.

[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:43.160]
Please a plunger on the first race, right?

[02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:46.880]
I'm a double on the double.

[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:47.340]
That's a double.

[02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:48.480]
They'll know what you're talking about.

[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:51.520]
Apparently the double is the first two races.

[02:17:51.740 --> 02:17:51.940]
Okay.

[02:17:51.940 --> 02:17:52.160]
I'm sorry.

[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:54.600]
I haven't even learned that all these weeks that you've been going out there.

[02:17:54.940 --> 02:17:55.680]
No, I haven't.

[02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:56.840]
And did we do this last year?

[02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:57.180]
Yes.

[02:17:57.540 --> 02:17:57.740]
Yeah.

[02:17:58.140 --> 02:17:59.020]
I'll get their eventual.

[02:17:59.100 --> 02:17:59.520]
Joe W.

[02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:03.760]
And cross brings us when were you on WALM 1965, Joe?

[02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:04.460]
Wow.

[02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:07.120]
Now this is good.

[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:09.920]
I even actually answered this guy, which I usually don't do.

[02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:14.240]
I went to Albion College, home of the Britons in the 62 63 school year.

[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:17.140]
I broadcast Albion College football and basketball in 65.

[02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:17.220]
I was on the TV.

[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:17.660]
A five.

[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:21.300]
Also, I found Winshulers cheese spread at public.

[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:21.820]
Mmm.

[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:22.640]
That's good stuff.

[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:23.680]
What?

[02:18:24.780 --> 02:18:26.660]
What's funny about that cheese spread?

[02:18:29.300 --> 02:18:32.480]
When you walk into Winshulers restaurant, you sit down at the table.

[02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:38.100]
And there'd be a big crock of that Winshulers cheese that you'd smell on bread and the crackers

[02:18:38.100 --> 02:18:38.600]
and stuff.

[02:18:39.500 --> 02:18:41.300]
And then they start selling it in supermarkets.

[02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:42.040]
It is delicious.

[02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:42.620]
Good start.

[02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:45.640]
Winshulers in Marshall's My All Time Favorite Restaurant says, Joe W.

[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:46.740]
The Prime Rib was great.

[02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:48.520]
You're showing Bob and Tom at the best he says.

[02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:49.440]
See, Joe's a good guy.

[02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:53.860]
And I worked in Marshall to a WMRR in 1966 and then it went off the air.

[02:18:55.100 --> 02:18:57.180]
I've worked at a lot of stations that no longer exist.

[02:18:58.440 --> 02:18:58.900]
Quits it?

[02:18:59.480 --> 02:18:59.840]
No.

[02:19:01.340 --> 02:19:03.160]
Oh, Tampa Bay, six minutes to the third.

[02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:05.720]
How many a minutes till the first race at Gulf Stream?

[02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:06.700]
Six.

[02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:07.960]
You know, we do have a betting interest.

[02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:09.800]
Six minutes till the first at Gulf Stream.

[02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:11.700]
All right.

[02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:14.520]
Yeah, and the professors give me crap.

[02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:18.120]
And he should know that the horse I used in the second race and I picked for our contest

[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:20.120]
is called Mr. Doctor Professor.

[02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:20.820]
How do you like that?

[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.520]
Not in his honor, but nevertheless.

[02:19:22.820 --> 02:19:25.380]
Oh, the fake Harry Carey's got an email.

[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:31.320]
This is good.

[02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:33.760]
If it levered pop up on here, hey, Neil.

[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:35.200]
Hey, Neil, you suck.

[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:36.680]
Love Harry and PS over the Cubs.

[02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:37.100]
That's cute.

[02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:40.960]
And the fake Steve Rodden arrow is just out of control.

[02:19:41.460 --> 02:19:42.140]
See what I mean?

[02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:43.700]
Once they get your attention.

[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:44.380]
Oh, yeah.

[02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:50.580]
And it says, oh, my God.

[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:51.720]
Neil, this is compelling radio.

[02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:53.000]
Somebody said that, but I don't know who.

[02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:56.120]
I got a call from Jim Berry.

[02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:59.840]
He said he and Chuck Dottler organizing a South Florida News Media reunion.

[02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:02.260]
They're playing a softball game as part of the festivities.

[02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:04.200]
Would you and Jim Maddish consider playing?

[02:20:04.440 --> 02:20:04.680]
No.

[02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:07.240]
If not, we hope you'd show up and say, hello.

[02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:07.560]
No.

[02:20:07.940 --> 02:20:12.120]
Jim and Chuck are planning to have at Brian Piccolo Park in Pemberg Park.

[02:20:14.060 --> 02:20:19.100]
I'm sure many of your old friends will be there, including Sally and Rick Sanchez.

[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:20.300]
I'm off to lunch.

[02:20:20.380 --> 02:20:23.200]
Busy day up here in the DC area says Steve Rodden arrow.

[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:24.520]
No, we're not going to be there.

[02:20:24.540 --> 02:20:25.040]
We don't care.

[02:20:25.420 --> 02:20:26.220]
And you're like that.

[02:20:26.480 --> 02:20:27.840]
I don't want to sound indifferent, but you know what?

[02:20:28.540 --> 02:20:28.900]
What?

[02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:29.400]
You're different.

[02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:29.840]
I am.

[02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:32.320]
I am very.

[02:20:32.620 --> 02:20:32.880]
Oh, yeah.

[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:33.320]
Here's one.

[02:20:33.380 --> 02:20:34.220]
This is riveting radio.

[02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:35.860]
This is from what's his name?

[02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:39.280]
Now, this is riveting compelling radio.

[02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:39.700]
I'm glued.

[02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:40.360]
Well, screw you.

[02:20:40.360 --> 02:20:42.760]
That's from LeBasterd, LeBasterd.

[02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:43.640]
Chronic.

[02:20:46.540 --> 02:20:49.300]
It's a paid promotion by Gulfstream Park.

[02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:49.640]
Okay.

[02:20:49.940 --> 02:20:50.440]
Pick the pony.

[02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:51.600]
It's something that we do every week.

[02:20:51.720 --> 02:20:52.040]
I'm Friday.

[02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:53.280]
You know, like it, go away.

[02:20:53.620 --> 02:20:53.760]
Right.

[02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:55.560]
Here's one.

[02:20:55.660 --> 02:20:56.440]
I'm listening on the archives.

[02:20:56.440 --> 02:20:59.080]
This might be a little late, but my kid gets this all the time.

[02:20:59.120 --> 02:20:59.800]
He's in middle school.

[02:21:00.180 --> 02:21:02.660]
They do a crappy job of keeping door handles and commentary is clean.

[02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:05.040]
He's talking about itchy skin.

[02:21:05.460 --> 02:21:05.800]
Oh.

[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:07.660]
Anyway, it's starting getting less one and sister.

[02:21:07.660 --> 02:21:12.220]
They wash more often, but when they do get any liquid antifungal, it does it.

[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:15.020]
Any liquid antifungal is a job.

[02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:17.580]
And I recommend swapping down that slot machine.

[02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:19.540]
I think that Jamaican lady licked it.

[02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:21.800]
The PSI guys burgers are made with people.

[02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:22.600]
They're people.

[02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:23.600]
Okay.

[02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:26.200]
Four minutes to the first.

[02:21:26.420 --> 02:21:27.060]
What is that?

[02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:27.820]
Oh, a Gulfstream.

[02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:30.460]
So I guess we better do the break right now.

[02:21:30.660 --> 02:21:31.500]
Oh, Neil.

[02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:33.000]
You're nothing to Neil Roger.

[02:21:33.260 --> 02:21:34.360]
Well, here we go again, man.

[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:35.660]
They're off.

[02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:38.600]
I need like that.

[02:21:38.780 --> 02:21:41.560]
Nice start for disperse who goes out to the front.

[02:21:41.720 --> 02:21:42.500]
Macgram and the inside.

[02:21:42.500 --> 02:21:43.420]
One guy we really do.

[02:21:43.420 --> 02:21:46.920]
Well, wild on boy right up with the leaders in third on the far outside.

[02:21:46.920 --> 02:21:47.760]
Great red feather.

[02:21:47.820 --> 02:21:48.260]
And the two.

[02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:48.580]
And the two.

[02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:49.240]
And the prominent early.

[02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:50.320]
Break of three.

[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:52.860]
Then comes Walker's beach toward the inside.

[02:21:53.100 --> 02:21:55.380]
So, my mom's right there on at the rail.

[02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:55.740]
Yep.

[02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:57.840]
And again, you don't want the two that go to the top.

[02:21:58.460 --> 02:21:59.280]
Heavy chalk, baby.

[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:01.180]
And tranquil bay trailed the field.

[02:22:01.180 --> 02:22:02.560]
Here comes the 12 on the inside.

[02:22:02.860 --> 02:22:03.880]
And three first quarter.

[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:05.400]
Two is going to win by the first.

[02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:09.220]
And Julian Leferoo lead the way by two lengths into the far turn.

[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:10.080]
One is piqued.

[02:22:10.140 --> 02:22:12.000]
And the second violin for the half.

[02:22:12.140 --> 02:22:13.380]
Macgram follows in third.

[02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:15.100]
Wild on boy fourth.

[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:15.780]
Dropping back.

[02:22:15.900 --> 02:22:16.960]
Now six from the front.

[02:22:17.340 --> 02:22:19.100]
And it's two lengths back to silver Ashley.

[02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:20.860]
Walker's beach on the outside.

[02:22:21.100 --> 02:22:21.360]
Two.

[02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:21.940]
And one.

[02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:22.760]
Secret.

[02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:23.960]
And that's three of three of five.

[02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:24.900]
And two is like five.

[02:22:25.100 --> 02:22:27.680]
And then disperse rolling right along here.

[02:22:28.340 --> 02:22:29.920]
45 and three to half.

[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:31.680]
And disperse is all alone.

[02:22:32.180 --> 02:22:34.340]
As they come to the top of the stretch.

[02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:36.120]
Disperse by ten.

[02:22:36.280 --> 02:22:37.380]
As they come to the A-fold.

[02:22:38.100 --> 02:22:40.120]
And then it's great red feather on the inside.

[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:41.380]
You guys can see the races over.

[02:22:41.580 --> 02:22:45.420]
Walker beach and silver Ashley down to the 16th.

[02:22:45.420 --> 02:22:45.600]
Full.

[02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:47.700]
It's a one horse race.

[02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:50.040]
Disperse.

[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:52.260]
Total domination here.

[02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:53.960]
Could not have won any easier.

[02:22:54.140 --> 02:22:54.680]
Okay, well, good.

[02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:57.600]
How do you like that to start the race there with that lucky timing or what?

[02:22:57.620 --> 02:22:57.980]
Yes, it was.

[02:22:58.200 --> 02:22:59.200]
Any and have time to say.

[02:22:59.260 --> 02:23:00.640]
Power for mocha to say that.

[02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:03.160]
Wow.

[02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:04.720]
Two wins by like 15 lengths.

[02:23:05.620 --> 02:23:05.980]
Sweet.

[02:23:06.520 --> 02:23:07.640]
Dropping is a good thing, right?

[02:23:08.660 --> 02:23:08.820]
What?

[02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:09.760]
That's a good thing, right?

[02:23:10.020 --> 02:23:13.000]
Well, it's a good thing only the only problem is that it's three to five favorite.

[02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:16.860]
So you're double if it comes in with the 11 is going to be a lot lower with the two.

[02:23:16.940 --> 02:23:18.140]
But at least you know, better to cash.

[02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:18.440]
Right.

[02:23:19.800 --> 02:23:22.300]
Better to cash than throw that ticket in the trash.

[02:23:25.060 --> 02:23:29.920]
Joseph, since you mentioned me a couple of times this week, Steve Ziegler's retired from radio and living on the west coast.

[02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:31.160]
Oh, that's the temporary.

[02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:33.000]
The last person away is Margie.

[02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:35.360]
And there are Mr David.

[02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:40.840]
Wasn't in the best of health a while ago, Steve Ziegler, but doing fine and happy now that he's out of the business and out of Miami.

[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:42.540]
One of the lucky ones.

[02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:47.180]
We need more like Ziggy says, Joe, you can drop online at the search and search.

[02:23:48.580 --> 02:23:49.400]
How do you like that?

[02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:50.100]
Steve Ziegler.

[02:23:50.180 --> 02:23:52.460]
Remember him with the big screwdriver that he always carried his back pocket?

[02:23:52.740 --> 02:23:52.880]
Yep.

[02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:54.840]
He was the pocket rocket.

[02:23:57.460 --> 02:24:04.560]
And anyway, Don says it is amazing that in this era of intellectuals that amnesia sit in on the same people who created the mess we're in.

[02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:06.040]
Intellectuals?

[02:24:06.100 --> 02:24:06.440]
Who are they?

[02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:07.160]
I don't know.

[02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:07.580]
I don't know.

[02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:16.440]
So the detriment of the country, the religious writer set upon a hypocritical mission to sabotage the efforts of President Obama and citizens of this country are trying to change things.

[02:24:17.260 --> 02:24:22.740]
Of course, the idea that everything was okay as W was leaving office is the very reason that they believe this country is going to be in trouble with Obama.

[02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:26.560]
When they told us to obey your President, they now tell us to subvert him.

[02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:31.280]
When they told us everything was done with meaning and purpose, they now state that everything that is done will ruin this country.

[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:38.940]
I only hope that the people of this country will always remember the ignorant criminal and preposterous Presidency of the Bush administration in Neil, we trust it said.

[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:39.620]
Neil, God!

[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:46.120]
Not that it was any great shakes with that three to five winner, but at least you were alive in the double.

[02:24:46.420 --> 02:24:46.800]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:48.520]
You were alive.

[02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:50.020]
But alive.

[02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:51.140]
Yeah.

[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.720]
Harry Potter says, oh, I haven't heard from her in a long time.

[02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:56.340]
Hey, Harry.

[02:24:56.500 --> 02:24:56.940]
You fairy.

[02:24:58.580 --> 02:25:03.200]
The follower who gave you the tip of cleaning your ear wax with a type of big pen is spot on. That was Brandon.

[02:25:03.860 --> 02:25:05.060]
I thought that was a joke.

[02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:07.380]
Clean the ear with a type of a big pen?

[02:25:07.620 --> 02:25:08.040]
That's what I do.

[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:09.520]
You do?

[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:10.700]
Yeah, take a pen cap.

[02:25:10.940 --> 02:25:11.020]
Yeah.

[02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:12.300]
Dangerous, man.

[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:12.940]
Man.

[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:14.740]
Harry says there's no better way.

[02:25:16.140 --> 02:25:19.100]
I thought I invented this myself, but it seems I'm really a co-inventor.

[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:21.880]
If you've neglected your ears and let wax build up until you can't hear well,

[02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:25.160]
well, sure you can go to the doctor and kill the day in the waiting room and spend your money

[02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:26.740]
while they extract the valve-fall of wax.

[02:25:27.380 --> 02:25:28.680]
But there's a much better way.

[02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:29.700]
Go swimming.

[02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:33.580]
Go find a pool spent about 30 minutes in there.

[02:25:33.900 --> 02:25:34.900]
Fuck third, man.

[02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:36.980]
Make sure your ears are underwater much at the time.

[02:25:37.260 --> 02:25:38.740]
Don't worry, you won't leak much in the pool.

[02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:41.900]
What's that racket there?

[02:25:42.180 --> 02:25:42.500]
I'm not sure.

[02:25:43.340 --> 02:25:44.980]
Hey, look behind.

[02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:45.860]
One moment please.

[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:46.760]
Surely.

[02:25:48.460 --> 02:25:49.160]
Is that surely?

[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:50.620]
All right, I'm back.

[02:25:51.580 --> 02:25:52.220]
Who was that?

[02:25:52.340 --> 02:25:52.560]
Shirley?

[02:25:52.800 --> 02:25:52.960]
Michelle.

[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:54.080]
Michelle.

[02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:58.380]
But when you're done, you'll notice a draining a bit for a day or two plus it'll soften up

[02:25:58.380 --> 02:26:03.060]
where you can reach it with your big top as you don't want to go very far down in your ear or you can damage your hearing.

[02:26:04.620 --> 02:26:08.280]
And then he's got some question mark about the stock market, which I wouldn't.

[02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:11.060]
I wouldn't even waste my time with a stock market, Harry.

[02:26:11.140 --> 02:26:12.260]
Okay, I wouldn't dignify my.

[02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:14.400]
Yeah, at least this kind of gambling is fun.

[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:15.800]
That's right.

[02:26:15.940 --> 02:26:17.000]
At least you get something for your money.

[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:18.080]
You get a little show for your money.

[02:26:18.180 --> 02:26:18.520]
That's right.

[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:20.560]
Here comes the bunny and there goes your money.

[02:26:20.660 --> 02:26:22.200]
Now is Steve there or what?

[02:26:22.300 --> 02:26:22.520]
He's here.

[02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:24.560]
And what's the two eleven double going to be?

[02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:26.140]
You've got a $11.5.

[02:26:26.340 --> 02:26:26.660]
What do you got?

[02:26:26.820 --> 02:26:27.480]
$11.5?

[02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:28.000]
$11.5 pays $11.

[02:26:28.420 --> 02:26:28.460]
Right?

[02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:31.480]
That's not very good.

[02:26:34.100 --> 02:26:34.920]
Might change though.

[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:35.340]
No?

[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:36.240]
No.

[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:37.380]
Okay, well, what do I do?

[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:38.720]
No, the double pool is separate.

[02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:40.980]
The double pool closes when the first race goes off.

[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:42.080]
Okay.

[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:47.700]
So if you win, you lose.

[02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:49.480]
How much did you bet?

[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:51.040]
Twenty-what?

[02:26:51.620 --> 02:26:52.900]
Oh, so you can make six fifty.

[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:54.260]
Oh, hey, whoo!

[02:26:54.260 --> 02:26:55.880]
And the forty bucks that Shirley gave you.

[02:26:56.920 --> 02:26:58.840]
What a good scam we got going here today.

[02:26:59.040 --> 02:26:59.660]
Well, that's my budget.

[02:27:00.380 --> 02:27:01.260]
That's what I'm using to play with.

[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:02.620]
We'll have the forty bucks.

[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:02.900]
Yeah.

[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:05.580]
Well, that's a good sign.

[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:08.800]
Now, the eleven opens at 99 to one.

[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:10.760]
Wait a minute.

[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:11.920]
Oh, that was from the first race.

[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:13.220]
But actually, it's given all of me.

[02:27:14.100 --> 02:27:14.460]
Wow.

[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:16.160]
That's still from the first race.

[02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:19.920]
I don't understand how's that possible.

[02:27:20.060 --> 02:27:20.400]
Oh, here we go.

[02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:22.000]
The second race, the eleven is five to one.

[02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:23.580]
Well, that's the morning line.

[02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:25.300]
He's the third choice.

[02:27:27.460 --> 02:27:30.020]
But the way the double is bet, that's a really good sign.

[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:31.300]
Good sign for you, asmon.

[02:27:33.020 --> 02:27:34.300]
Only $11.00 double.

[02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:35.660]
Chalk.

[02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:38.260]
Remember what your buddy Phil Arks says?

[02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:38.960]
Bet the chalk.

[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:39.540]
Bet the chalk.

[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:40.440]
He's an expert, man.

[02:27:40.860 --> 02:27:42.940]
He's an expert, expert pervert.

[02:27:43.960 --> 02:27:44.700]
So what do you think?

[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:47.500]
I think nothing.

[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:50.560]
Ida says, remember Ida AIDA?

[02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:51.080]
Yes.

[02:27:51.940 --> 02:27:53.200]
Is the beast still on the border?

[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:54.140]
Is he a disappearer?

[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:54.480]
I'm right here.

[02:27:54.860 --> 02:27:56.480]
I guess you're just not interested in the racing, huh?

[02:27:56.940 --> 02:27:57.060]
No.

[02:27:58.060 --> 02:27:58.780]
Well, why not?

[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:00.160]
Oh, I don't have any money on it.

[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:00.740]
Oh.

[02:28:01.380 --> 02:28:02.100]
Well, why not?

[02:28:02.460 --> 02:28:04.660]
Well, you're going to enjoy your hundred-eat-a-taken

[02:28:04.660 --> 02:28:05.360]
at the airport, right?

[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:05.920]
Play what?

[02:28:06.180 --> 02:28:07.580]
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll front you.

[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:08.760]
I'll be your bookie over here.

[02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:09.340]
Oh, great.

[02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:11.280]
No.

[02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:13.100]
Don't do it.

[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:14.320]
He's a married man with a family.

[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:18.500]
I know you are, too, but you just don't care.

[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:19.080]
That's right.

[02:28:19.940 --> 02:28:21.260]
Ida says, Neil, how are you?

[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:23.040]
It's nice to hear your manly voice again.

[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:25.900]
My manly voice.

[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:26.740]
You're fairie.

[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:27.560]
You're mad, man.

[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:28.860]
I had taken a trip to Georgia.

[02:28:29.020 --> 02:28:30.900]
That's why I didn't hear you for a couple of days.

[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:33.180]
The weather was cold, but the people are much nicer up there.

[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:36.020]
As opposed to here where the weather is hot and the people are cold A-holes.

[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:36.660]
Wow.

[02:28:37.100 --> 02:28:37.380]
Ida.

[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:39.080]
Hi, George.

[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:40.980]
And tell the big OISOM on TV last night.

[02:28:40.980 --> 02:28:43.800]
I have nothing against him, but he has a face only for radio.

[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:46.840]
Big O, grow back to facial hair, please, and get a suntan.

[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:49.820]
PSU forgot Isaac Hayes for the pool.

[02:28:50.180 --> 02:28:50.800]
Too late, Ida.

[02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:51.060]
Sorry.

[02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:52.220]
Oh, wow.

[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:52.840]
Yeah.

[02:28:53.460 --> 02:28:54.080]
That's bad.

[02:28:55.020 --> 02:28:56.660]
I've had a red that at the beginning of the show.

[02:28:56.720 --> 02:28:57.660]
What time did I just send this?

[02:28:58.060 --> 02:28:59.260]
150 yesterday afternoon.

[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:01.180]
Before the end of yesterday's show.

[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:03.240]
If I'd have read that, if I'd have been on top of things,

[02:29:03.460 --> 02:29:04.600]
we'd have gotten Isaac Hayes on there.

[02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:05.500]
We'd have gotten a couple of votes.

[02:29:05.500 --> 02:29:07.840]
And that in 40 cents will buy you a cup of coffee.

[02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:11.300]
Let's see how we're doing here.

[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:13.220]
We got 931 votes on the pool.

[02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:14.940]
We're looking for 950, I think.

[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:17.880]
Okay.

[02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:25.160]
John Wilson sends me a thing about the USA versus Canada Baseball Classic Saturday, March 7th, in Toronto.

[02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:27.780]
You may have already spoken about this or may not give it to me.

[02:29:27.980 --> 02:29:28.480]
Get the latter.

[02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:29.160]
I don't give it to me.

[02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:31.600]
I haven't spoken about it, and I'm not going to when I couldn't care less.

[02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:35.000]
The USA Canada Baseball Classic in Toronto.

[02:29:35.660 --> 02:29:36.260]
Wow.

[02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:38.360]
You care about it?

[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:38.860]
Nope.

[02:29:42.580 --> 02:29:46.940]
Here's one that says when I originally bought the soundtrack to a clockwork orange in vinyl,

[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:49.320]
the composer was listed as Walter Carlos.

[02:29:49.960 --> 02:29:52.840]
Years later, I bought the CD by Wendy Carlos.

[02:29:54.060 --> 02:29:57.440]
It seems that in between he became a she.

[02:29:58.140 --> 02:29:59.940]
And took a walk on the wild side.

[02:29:59.940 --> 02:30:01.920]
Water became Wendy.

[02:30:03.020 --> 02:30:03.960]
Everyone does its one.

[02:30:06.820 --> 02:30:08.960]
That sounds like goat by association to me.

[02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:12.040]
So the second race is, well, I don't know,

[02:30:12.680 --> 02:30:14.160]
90 minutes to post 144.

[02:30:15.020 --> 02:30:16.480]
And let's see how the early money is going.

[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:17.080]
Oh, look at that.

[02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:18.380]
The 11 is 3 to 5 favorite.

[02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:20.520]
3 to 5, it opens up.

[02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:24.900]
I'd get ready to go jump up and go cash that ticket now.

[02:30:25.540 --> 02:30:27.040]
You're listening to Neil Rogers.

[02:30:27.340 --> 02:30:28.220]
Well, here we go again.

[02:30:28.220 --> 02:30:30.740]
It's Friday, you bastards.

[02:30:33.540 --> 02:30:35.580]
Oh, may I be helping you today?

[02:30:36.180 --> 02:30:38.840]
Hey, would you please be having a blue-skinned VG?

[02:30:39.220 --> 02:30:40.580]
We are having a sale on camera.

[02:30:41.440 --> 02:30:43.380]
We have had about many flavors.

[02:30:44.220 --> 02:30:45.880]
I'm afraid that is not digital.

[02:30:48.900 --> 02:30:49.380]
No!

[02:30:49.380 --> 02:30:50.980]
Okay, I'm telling you everything.

[02:30:51.720 --> 02:30:54.200]
I just can make it happen inside that you think.

[02:30:54.400 --> 02:30:55.580]
Hey, yes, it's true.

[02:30:55.580 --> 02:30:56.780]
We're going to the women in bags.

[02:30:57.060 --> 02:30:59.360]
It is only because they smell so bad.

[02:30:59.560 --> 02:31:01.900]
You can play the group reactions of a group.

[02:31:01.900 --> 02:31:03.500]
But we don't all drink out of wee.

[02:31:03.700 --> 02:31:04.460]
It's been like our group.

[02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:06.720]
I can't excuse that drinking for no reason.

[02:31:07.180 --> 02:31:09.620]
I can't keep up my business with my face clean.

[02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:10.200]

[02:31:13.180 --> 02:31:14.220]
I can't.

[02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:15.520]
I can't.

[02:31:15.520 --> 02:31:15.660]
I can't.

[02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:15.660]

[02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:15.660]

[02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:17.400]
If you're too excused, I'm ready to choose.

[02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:18.340]
Hey, G.

[02:31:18.540 --> 02:31:19.300]
Hey, G.

[02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:20.620]
It's been ragged.

[02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:21.680]
I'm not done.

[02:31:22.120 --> 02:31:22.640]
I'm not done.

[02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:23.280]
I can't.

[02:31:23.440 --> 02:31:24.220]
I'm not done.

[02:31:24.220 --> 02:31:24.660]
I'm not done.

[02:31:27.340 --> 02:31:29.460]
I'm not done.

[02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:31.920]
I'm not done.

[02:31:32.580 --> 02:31:32.580]

[02:31:33.020 --> 02:31:33.360]
I'm not done.

[02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:33.600]
I'm not done.

[02:31:33.600 --> 02:31:33.600]

[02:31:33.600 --> 02:31:33.600]

[02:31:33.600 --> 02:31:33.600]

[02:31:34.860 --> 02:31:35.260]
I'm not done.

[02:31:35.260 --> 02:31:35.360]
I'm not done.

[02:31:35.360 --> 02:31:35.420]
I'm not done.

[02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.500]
Well, remember, we had to pull about minor injuries.

[02:31:38.520 --> 02:31:39.600]
And which one is the worst?

[02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:40.220]
And the Adi Adi Adi?

[02:31:41.280 --> 02:31:41.680]
What?

[02:31:41.740 --> 02:31:42.640]
Oh, that pole.

[02:31:43.460 --> 02:31:45.960]
So, as somebody says, bruised ribs which last for months,

[02:31:46.100 --> 02:31:48.140]
I can testify to that because remember that I fell in an

[02:31:48.140 --> 02:31:48.720]
hamster then that time.

[02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:48.860]
That's right.

[02:31:49.220 --> 02:31:52.340]
And I had broken ribs and man that goes on for an eternity.

[02:31:52.340 --> 02:31:54.040]
11 is 4 to 5, favorite.

[02:31:55.920 --> 02:31:57.280]
And the second way is the Gulf Stream.

[02:31:57.640 --> 02:31:59.800]
It says with ribs breathing, laughing, coughing, and just

[02:31:59.800 --> 02:32:02.460]
turning around, hurts for weeks, balls quid hurting an hour or so.

[02:32:03.300 --> 02:32:06.160]
So, if you have a choice between bruised or broken ribs or

[02:32:06.160 --> 02:32:07.780]
kicked into balls, take the kick.

[02:32:09.540 --> 02:32:10.720]
Take a kick in the nuts.

[02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:17.420]
Barry Jackass reminds me that today is Myron Cope Day in the

[02:32:17.420 --> 02:32:18.000]
city of Pittsburgh.

[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:19.840]
Who?

[02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:24.920]
Myron Cope, he's the was the color commentator for the Pittsburgh

[02:32:24.920 --> 02:32:26.320]
Steelers for about 100 years.

[02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:28.200]
Well, I'll wave our terrible towels.

[02:32:28.640 --> 02:32:31.480]
He did the terrible towels wielded by fans at Steelers Games.

[02:32:31.860 --> 02:32:35.200]
Color commentator for the Steelers from 1970 through 2005,

[02:32:35.200 --> 02:32:36.460]
35 years.

[02:32:37.940 --> 02:32:38.840]
He's still dead.

[02:32:40.580 --> 02:32:43.340]
But anyway, the Pittsburgh mayor Luke Ravenstalls making the

[02:32:43.340 --> 02:32:45.900]
official proclamation on the air he did it a couple hours ago.

[02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:48.400]
On WEE.

[02:32:50.340 --> 02:32:51.920]
Whatever happened to 4 KDK8?

[02:32:52.040 --> 02:32:53.620]
Didn't they just almost lose their license or something?

[02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:55.900]
They had some kind of a scheme going KDK8?

[02:32:57.140 --> 02:32:58.640]
Well, the business sharing what it was.

[02:32:58.780 --> 02:32:59.640]
Let's hear some Bob Prince.

[02:32:59.820 --> 02:33:00.440]
What are you saying, Neil?

[02:33:00.900 --> 02:33:00.900]

[02:33:02.140 --> 02:33:02.940]
For you stop.

[02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:06.260]
How about you, or Beast, don't even know from Bob Prince?

[02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:08.840]
No, you.

[02:33:09.180 --> 02:33:09.260]
No.

[02:33:10.360 --> 02:33:11.120]
Well, that's bad.

[02:33:11.580 --> 02:33:11.920]
Now, let's see.

[02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:13.660]
Who is doing the red star schemes when you were there?

[02:33:14.380 --> 02:33:15.240]
In Boston?

[02:33:15.700 --> 02:33:16.040]
Yeah.

[02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:17.300]
On TV or radio?

[02:33:17.440 --> 02:33:18.020]
Wait a minute.

[02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:20.500]
No, the red star schemes in Cleveland.

[02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:23.080]
What kind of a question is that?

[02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:23.700]
In Boston?

[02:33:25.100 --> 02:33:26.400]
On TV or radio?

[02:33:28.220 --> 02:33:29.180]
TV, Shymaktana.

[02:33:29.780 --> 02:33:31.280]
Oh, bald head of geek.

[02:33:32.380 --> 02:33:33.640]
He's awful. He's boring.

[02:33:35.020 --> 02:33:35.780]
He's horrible.

[02:33:35.980 --> 02:33:37.680]
And the guy that preceded him was pretty weak too.

[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:38.760]
Boring. What was his name?

[02:33:40.100 --> 02:33:41.060]
I forget.

[02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:42.520]
Dick Stockton did him at once.

[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:44.120]
No, please not Dick Stockton.

[02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:45.860]
Nobody wants to hear about Dick.

[02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:47.060]
Ned Martin?

[02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:47.480]
I don't know.

[02:33:47.480 --> 02:33:47.920]
Ned Martin?

[02:33:48.100 --> 02:33:49.320]
That's who it was. He was very boring.

[02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:51.120]
Ken Coleman was great.

[02:33:51.660 --> 02:33:53.660]
And Kurt Gaudi, but that's way before your time.

[02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:54.080]
Right.

[02:33:55.260 --> 02:33:56.520]
Way before your time.

[02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:58.940]
Who broadcasted the Patriots games on the radio?

[02:33:59.780 --> 02:34:00.520]
Gil Santos?

[02:34:01.180 --> 02:34:01.460]
Is he good?

[02:34:01.900 --> 02:34:03.640]
Yeah, he's been doing it for a gazillion years.

[02:34:03.940 --> 02:34:04.240]
Wow.

[02:34:04.980 --> 02:34:07.000]
And Gino Capilletti does the color.

[02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:09.300]
Gino Capilletti, are you kidding me?

[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:10.240]
Another dumb jock?

[02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:13.160]
That's like the Turk.

[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:16.000]
Similar.

[02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:17.260]
Yeah, similar.

[02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:18.320]
And the board goes back.

[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:19.580]
Wow, that's sad.

[02:34:20.820 --> 02:34:23.140]
KC says, oh, this is one of my very favorites.

[02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:26.240]
This got lost in the bottom of my pile,

[02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:27.920]
but better late than ever. It's the end of the week.

[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:31.540]
High Neal, it's no wonder that so many people

[02:34:31.540 --> 02:34:33.020]
have stated they're reluctant to write to you

[02:34:33.020 --> 02:34:34.240]
as you consistently misconstrued

[02:34:35.020 --> 02:34:37.940]
nearly everything I write and or jump to the wrong conclusions.

[02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:41.120]
It's annoying and disconcerting.

[02:34:41.300 --> 02:34:42.800]
I think this is the one of the guys that ripped you in

[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:43.340]
ass the other day.

[02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:44.480]
Remember when it was ripped to your jazz?

[02:34:45.500 --> 02:34:46.000]
All day.

[02:34:47.900 --> 02:34:49.500]
Then, loving by the way, still four to five.

[02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:51.900]
I try to work my sentences very carefully and clearly,

[02:34:51.900 --> 02:34:54.020]
but I'm sure you'll manage to take this the wrong way as usual.

[02:34:54.420 --> 02:34:55.920]
I'll stick to listening only as writing to you

[02:34:55.920 --> 02:34:57.020]
as an exercise and futility.

[02:34:57.160 --> 02:34:57.340]
Right.

[02:34:57.980 --> 02:35:00.060]
Go ahead and call me Yeyenta, say bye-bye,

[02:35:00.200 --> 02:35:01.540]
tummy to get a life all very predictable,

[02:35:01.900 --> 02:35:04.500]
and lacking creativity since you can't seem to follow what I write

[02:35:04.500 --> 02:35:05.280]
on the reason for it.

[02:35:05.540 --> 02:35:07.540]
Love you anyways and always KC, Mosher.

[02:35:07.540 --> 02:35:08.080]
Well, good.

[02:35:08.420 --> 02:35:11.740]
We actually wait your next fake email or the next fake date that you make.

[02:35:11.740 --> 02:35:12.380]
Right, that's right.

[02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:12.800]
Fake account.

[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:15.900]
C. Georgia is just a cynic and a skeptic.

[02:35:16.060 --> 02:35:16.260]
That's right.

[02:35:16.260 --> 02:35:17.320]
Your voice is four to five favorite.

[02:35:17.980 --> 02:35:18.840]
Confidence is high.

[02:35:19.020 --> 02:35:20.080]
And let's do the break because

[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:21.540]
I'll give you a little bit.

[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:22.360]
What?

[02:35:23.740 --> 02:35:25.960]
It's Friday, you bastards.

[02:35:27.780 --> 02:35:28.580]
Oh, Canada.

[02:35:30.580 --> 02:35:34.320]
Our home and needed friends.

[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:38.520]
High-pog and C.

[02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:43.560]
Will love you and your hand.

[02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:44.200]
Welcome.

[02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:48.320]
With the sugar, it's not too fire-side.

[02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:52.620]
We reclaim your good you see.

[02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:57.500]
It's illegal sugar-curdings you.

[02:35:57.500 --> 02:36:02.320]
Oh, you have an old eye, you see.

[02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:12.040]
The day that we courier than dreaming.

[02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:21.120]
Oh, Canada, this is as dumb to me.

[02:36:24.460 --> 02:36:31.660]
Oh, Canada, this is as dumb to me.

[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:35.220]
All right, got some good news.

[02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:35.620]
I forgot.

[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:37.300]
You got the Adelaide two in the double.

[02:36:37.540 --> 02:36:37.860]
That's right.

[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:39.080]
You got a two-aid.

[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:40.240]
Well, how much is the two-aid?

[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:43.120]
You wrote it down here.

[02:36:43.500 --> 02:36:43.760]
What's this?

[02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:44.420]
56?

[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:46.240]
56 bucks.

[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:46.860]
Yes.

[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:50.340]
Well, see, we got mixed emotions now because for your sake, we want the aid to win.

[02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:52.040]
But for a more, we want the 11.

[02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:53.780]
11 is four to five favorite.

[02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:54.540]
It's all good.

[02:36:54.980 --> 02:36:55.880]
The 8 is 7 to 1.

[02:36:55.960 --> 02:36:57.680]
Either way, he was 12 to 1 in the morning.

[02:36:57.760 --> 02:36:58.480]
9 is 7 to 1.

[02:36:58.520 --> 02:36:59.460]
He's taking some money, honey.

[02:37:00.940 --> 02:37:04.620]
We have four minutes to post down for the second race at Gulf Stream.

[02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:07.060]
Oh, this is captivating radio.

[02:37:07.180 --> 02:37:08.020]
And I screw you.

[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:09.940]
If you don't like it, go away.

[02:37:10.140 --> 02:37:11.060]
That's very simple.

[02:37:11.900 --> 02:37:13.980]
Instead of we do this once a month.

[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:16.920]
Once a month, what?

[02:37:17.340 --> 02:37:18.460]
This is how often we do this.

[02:37:18.460 --> 02:37:20.760]
Well, I do the pick-up pony thing every Friday.

[02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:24.520]
But I mean, as far as making the whole show into it, it's George is out there once a month.

[02:37:24.860 --> 02:37:25.020]
Right.

[02:37:25.500 --> 02:37:27.540]
And once a month, surely brings him 40 bucks.

[02:37:27.900 --> 02:37:29.040]
Make sure that he keeps it.

[02:37:29.180 --> 02:37:30.320]
11 is even money, by the way.

[02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:31.800]
Okay.

[02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:34.100]
Even money, honey.

[02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:35.740]
And the 8 is 7 to 1.

[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:38.940]
So you're rooting for the 8.

[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:40.840]
Morris is rooting for the 11.

[02:37:41.940 --> 02:37:44.800]
PR Rouse says George has just enough money for an 8th of an ounce of weed.

[02:37:46.420 --> 02:37:47.260]
Maybe his prizes.

[02:37:47.260 --> 02:37:50.480]
By the way, knowing that Monday's your anniversary and the masses of asses will be all over you.

[02:37:50.580 --> 02:37:51.580]
I'm wishing you a happy anniversary.

[02:37:52.020 --> 02:37:53.360]
I think I should have Monday off, don't you?

[02:37:53.500 --> 02:37:54.320]
For my 30th anniversary.

[02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:54.820]
No, no, no.

[02:37:55.100 --> 02:37:56.220]
How can you enjoy the celebration?

[02:37:56.220 --> 02:37:57.020]
I'm glad you guys enjoy them.

[02:37:57.040 --> 02:37:58.260]
Kisses and hugs, PR Rouse.

[02:37:58.320 --> 02:37:58.420]
What?

[02:37:58.680 --> 02:38:02.060]
The celebration, the outpouring of affection that you're going to get on Monday.

[02:38:02.220 --> 02:38:04.660]
How you can't enjoy that, if you're wrong.

[02:38:04.660 --> 02:38:07.520]
I'm going to go to lunch today and honor my anniversary.

[02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:09.500]
And that's quite an honor.

[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:11.280]
That is it, honor.

[02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:13.460]
And honor all the money of the winning of Woodvine, boy.

[02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:16.300]
I've been just kicking big smelly ash there.

[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:19.920]
Someone in Pooh and Jobby, man.

[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:20.820]
They think they own a place.

[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:21.840]
What is that all about?

[02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:24.340]
You said Pooh and Jobby.

[02:38:24.340 --> 02:38:25.020]
Pooh and Jobby.

[02:38:26.540 --> 02:38:27.600]
Because often they can't.

[02:38:28.100 --> 02:38:30.500]
Big Joe says, I'm a long time listener in a fan of yours show.

[02:38:30.700 --> 02:38:35.980]
I heard you talking yesterday about the Ashley Madison cheating website and said that women had a problem with the site amended not.

[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:40.500]
As a kid who watched his father cheat on his mother throughout his childhood and didn't have the courage to tell her,

[02:38:40.500 --> 02:38:43.900]
I'm disturbed at a website like this can be blatantly broadcast in a radio ad.

[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:48.240]
I'll always be a Neely, but I just wanted to let you know there's at least one guy who's got a problem with it.

[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:48.760]
Yeah, right.

[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:49.980]
Big Joe and Boyton Beach, what?

[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:51.400]
I said, yeah, right.

[02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:52.260]
Yeah, right what?

[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.500]
No guy can have a problem with it.

[02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:57.160]
Yeah, I just told you.

[02:38:57.220 --> 02:38:57.760]
Post time.

[02:38:57.820 --> 02:38:58.880]
I almost forgot about the race.

[02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:01.660]
Don't.

[02:39:04.820 --> 02:39:08.560]
Oh, yeah, here's the thing from the fake Tom Jicke about Michael Savage fighting the furnace doctor.

[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:11.720]
Even though Obama says he has no intention of bringing it back.

[02:39:12.780 --> 02:39:14.680]
Like a dog barking at the moon.

[02:39:14.820 --> 02:39:23.240]
That's people like Michael Savage and Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh comedian Rush Limbaugh's over in Coleson.

[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:27.200]
Getting right in there David Amherst, he's through the challenge.

[02:39:27.620 --> 02:39:29.680]
In deep stretch, it's Tom's turn.

[02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:32.280]
There's a lot in the mail and going.

[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:36.220]
He's going to be able to gain effort.

[02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:38.280]
He works with the Tampa Bay down.

[02:39:38.300 --> 02:39:40.840]
Good thing they got that over with though.

[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:44.920]
Because you only got one minute to post time for the second race of Gulfstream.

[02:39:46.060 --> 02:39:46.640]
Oh, right.

[02:39:46.740 --> 02:39:47.720]
Here's the Houses out there.

[02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:48.380]
They're going to the gate.

[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:52.040]
I should make up a call.

[02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:52.760]
Let's make it up.

[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:53.200]
Of course.

[02:39:53.420 --> 02:39:53.600]
It's a thing.

[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:58.900]
I would be how Joe Tannenbaum used to he used to predict how the race would go and he would call a fake race before the race.

[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:00.280]
Really?

[02:40:00.280 --> 02:40:00.940]
The feature race.

[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:03.340]
When you didn't notice back in those days, you weren't in all this too.

[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:04.320]
One minute or something.

[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:05.360]
What?

[02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:09.820]
I see your orientation in the first planet.

[02:40:10.060 --> 02:40:10.060]

[02:40:11.740 --> 02:40:12.800]
They're going in the gate.

[02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:14.340]
You know what that means, don't you?

[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:15.340]
That I can't wait.

[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:18.360]
The 8 is 8 to 1, 11 is 6 to 5.

[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:19.680]
7 to 5.

[02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:20.520]
Who's getting late money?

[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:20.880]
2.

[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:22.060]
Scotch on the rocks.

[02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:23.240]
Scotch on the rocks.

[02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:24.720]
I don't think so.

[02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:27.220]
He did win.

[02:40:27.220 --> 02:40:27.880]
Scotch on the rocks.

[02:40:27.900 --> 02:40:28.560]
Back in the 7.

[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:32.620]
He was claimed last start.

[02:40:34.500 --> 02:40:36.060]
Master castle going in.

[02:40:36.300 --> 02:40:37.340]
Tyring and Stebjud.

[02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:40.660]
He was you Tyring and also end excuse for the next.

[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:45.760]
This is the part that Mora's were pulling for you.

[02:40:45.820 --> 02:40:47.180]
We got 50 bucks to win for any 11.

[02:40:47.220 --> 02:40:48.880]
Ethan the monster coming out.

[02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:49.860]
I'm just pulling for the 8.

[02:40:50.060 --> 02:40:50.460]
I'm sorry.

[02:40:50.780 --> 02:40:51.400]
It's okay.

[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:53.600]
The 8 is 8 to 1.

[02:40:53.620 --> 02:40:54.260]
What do you call it?

[02:40:54.420 --> 02:40:56.140]
The 8 is 8 to 1.

[02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:57.200]
What do you call it?

[02:40:57.200 --> 02:40:57.820]
The 8 will take its-

[02:40:57.820 --> 02:40:57.960]
Right.

[02:40:58.320 --> 02:40:59.300]
Spinder mandate.

[02:40:59.300 --> 02:40:59.300]

[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:02.360]
And that other thing.

[02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:03.980]
Then what thing?

[02:41:04.260 --> 02:41:05.220]
12 and 11 double $2.

[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:06.100]
You had me back.

[02:41:06.340 --> 02:41:07.320]
Built to precision.

[02:41:08.020 --> 02:41:10.040]
And mandate image the next two-

[02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:10.040]

[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:12.420]
Whatever that last thing you told me about one.

[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:14.140]
12 and 11.

[02:41:14.340 --> 02:41:15.680]
The 12, 11.

[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:17.780]
You've got a 12, 11?

[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:19.400]
And the last 12 didn't win the first race.

[02:41:19.660 --> 02:41:20.820]
It's through your professor.

[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:25.460]
How much is this worth?

[02:41:27.100 --> 02:41:27.900]
Oh, Raspberry.

[02:41:29.820 --> 02:41:30.220]
Squatski.

[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:31.440]
And they're all in line.

[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:32.900]
All in line.

[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:33.280]
They're ready.

[02:41:33.700 --> 02:41:34.560]
Ready for a start.

[02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:36.160]
Ready for a break.

[02:41:36.260 --> 02:41:37.580]
Dr. Professor is backed out.

[02:41:37.820 --> 02:41:39.160]
Oh, the 11 backed out.

[02:41:39.580 --> 02:41:40.140]
Back in.

[02:41:40.260 --> 02:41:40.700]
Back in.

[02:41:40.900 --> 02:41:41.100]
Ready.

[02:41:41.260 --> 02:41:42.300]
In and out.

[02:41:42.540 --> 02:41:43.380]
I think you're going to get screwed.

[02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:44.840]
They're all in line.

[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:45.740]
The 11 broke great.

[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:46.900]
At a boy can't.

[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:48.380]
Mr. Dr. Professor came on.

[02:41:48.380 --> 02:41:49.480]
He's flying on the gate.

[02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:50.980]
He's hard sent for the lead.

[02:41:51.220 --> 02:41:51.880]
He's not being hot-hearted.

[02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:53.680]
Sent hired and right there too.

[02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:54.500]
Built to precision.

[02:41:54.500 --> 02:41:55.540]
All together on the way.

[02:41:55.700 --> 02:41:56.020]
He's late.

[02:41:56.640 --> 02:41:57.300]
Scotch on the rock.

[02:41:57.500 --> 02:41:58.560]
He's not too far.

[02:41:58.700 --> 02:41:58.920]
Can't.

[02:41:58.980 --> 02:41:59.680]
I'm moving down the back.

[02:41:59.700 --> 02:42:00.400]
Not out of the race.

[02:42:00.580 --> 02:42:01.020]
On the rocks.

[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:01.820]
Come to the lead.

[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:04.240]
Country Monarch is second.

[02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:05.020]
Go for precision.

[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:06.020]
Third, twenty percent.

[02:42:06.260 --> 02:42:06.540]
Fourth.

[02:42:06.940 --> 02:42:08.100]
Two six five four.

[02:42:08.220 --> 02:42:08.740]
There's no way.

[02:42:08.860 --> 02:42:09.340]
And you're alive.

[02:42:09.820 --> 02:42:10.180]
Sitting outside.

[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:11.480]
He's sitting.

[02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:11.920]
He's sitting.

[02:42:12.180 --> 02:42:14.080]
After that comes Mande.

[02:42:14.700 --> 02:42:15.420]
Spider Mande.

[02:42:15.780 --> 02:42:15.800]
He's fifth.

[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:18.340]
Master Tassel is right there too.

[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:19.260]
Hey, Morris.

[02:42:19.320 --> 02:42:20.080]
He's fifth.

[02:42:20.260 --> 02:42:21.500]
When he's right there in the strike position.

[02:42:21.620 --> 02:42:22.400]
He can't just throw it.

[02:42:22.420 --> 02:42:23.360]
I've been to first quarter.

[02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:24.280]
Writing this word.

[02:42:24.480 --> 02:42:25.300]
He passed the half-mide.

[02:42:25.300 --> 02:42:26.100]
Getting into the race.

[02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:26.980]
Scotch on the rock.

[02:42:26.980 --> 02:42:27.940]
Passing those two dead.

[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:29.140]
Country Monarch or one two.

[02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:30.280]
And there he goes.

[02:42:30.340 --> 02:42:30.700]
Five links.

[02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:31.540]
Clear of the rest.

[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:32.780]
Twenty-four-third.

[02:42:32.780 --> 02:42:35.580]
There goes Mr. Doctor Professor on the outside.

[02:42:35.620 --> 02:42:36.360]
He's up to 30s.

[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:37.400]
Climb.

[02:42:37.580 --> 02:42:38.240]
Four of the top two.

[02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:39.300]
Three for the long.

[02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:39.900]
Two for the minute.

[02:42:40.060 --> 02:42:40.380]
And a puke there.

[02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:40.600]
Good.

[02:42:40.740 --> 02:42:41.580]
Master Tassel.

[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:43.140]
Well, if I'm not precision.

[02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:44.880]
Mande hit him at John the Gold side.

[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:46.540]
Then gold's classy Oregon.

[02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:47.080]
Two six.

[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:48.580]
He does have a little bit of a delight.

[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:49.120]
Spider Mande.

[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:51.400]
Meanwhile, the 11th Doctor Professor.

[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:53.700]
He looks like he might be hanging a little bit.

[02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:54.920]
45 and 1 that half.

[02:42:54.920 --> 02:42:55.780]
Come on, Mr. Mollye.

[02:42:55.780 --> 02:42:57.420]
You've got to Scotch on the rock.

[02:42:57.420 --> 02:42:58.060]
Still the catch.

[02:42:58.680 --> 02:43:00.540]
Mr. Doctor Professor on the outside.

[02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:02.940]
Country Monarch has given away.

[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:05.160]
11 and 11th taking leave for the win at ease.

[02:43:05.380 --> 02:43:05.960]
Master Tassel.

[02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:06.640]
Got it.

[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:07.680]
And a more important.

[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:08.680]
Doctor Pro.

[02:43:08.680 --> 02:43:10.340]
And George the Sixth Box and Mande.

[02:43:11.020 --> 02:43:12.780]
What's going to give you surely a rich.

[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:14.600]
And Mr. Doctor Pro.

[02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:16.080]
I'm going to track every day for all of you.

[02:43:16.100 --> 02:43:16.720]
Look at that.

[02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:17.940]
Nice big man.

[02:43:18.100 --> 02:43:18.760]
You know something?

[02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:19.260]
What is that?

[02:43:19.460 --> 02:43:20.440]
Four wins in five weeks.

[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:21.600]
I think that's right.

[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:22.840]
You'll have to do it there.

[02:43:22.900 --> 02:43:23.440]
I am God.

[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:24.960]
You know what I'm saying.

[02:43:25.180 --> 02:43:25.960]
I am God.

[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:26.580]
Fire.

[02:43:26.780 --> 02:43:27.440]
I want to flamacy.

[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:29.740]
Easy.

[02:43:30.440 --> 02:43:32.060]
Jag Boiger is the saying of business.

[02:43:32.220 --> 02:43:32.720]
Jag Boiger.

[02:43:32.940 --> 02:43:33.400]
What does that mean?

[02:43:34.020 --> 02:43:35.320]
In other words, he jogged.

[02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:35.960]
He wanted to see.

[02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:37.480]
No little contendray, man.

[02:43:38.220 --> 02:43:39.220]
What does that mean?

[02:43:39.380 --> 02:43:41.040]
Will you wake up and how about the beast?

[02:43:41.100 --> 02:43:42.160]
Did you fall asleep yet or what?

[02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:42.940]
Are we still here?

[02:43:46.660 --> 02:43:47.600]
So it's this one, right?

[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:49.060]
Sorry, I'm talking to Steve.

[02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:50.980]
I'm talking to Steve about one.

[02:43:52.140 --> 02:43:54.280]
Okay, you got a $5 double, $211.

[02:43:55.820 --> 02:43:57.680]
And what do you give me this 12 11 crap?

[02:43:58.020 --> 02:43:59.640]
See, you don't understand the daily double.

[02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:01.140]
You have to pick the winners of the first two races.

[02:44:01.420 --> 02:44:02.000]
No problem.

[02:44:02.340 --> 02:44:06.260]
Once the two won the first race, all the tickets on the other winners in the first race.

[02:44:06.260 --> 02:44:07.560]
All learned in the first one, the 12.

[02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:08.940]
Burn them.

[02:44:09.180 --> 02:44:09.760]
Five or years.

[02:44:10.220 --> 02:44:10.960]
I'll have this down.

[02:44:11.180 --> 02:44:12.860]
God, you are slow as my last.

[02:44:13.680 --> 02:44:14.540]
So I love Steve.

[02:44:14.660 --> 02:44:16.060]
What do the horse finally go off at?

[02:44:17.340 --> 02:44:17.920]
The 11.

[02:44:20.020 --> 02:44:20.720]
Who would have five?

[02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:21.960]
So it's going to pay about $360.

[02:44:22.740 --> 02:44:23.400]
So let's see.

[02:44:23.620 --> 02:44:23.880]
$50.

[02:44:26.900 --> 02:44:27.540]
Is $90.

[02:44:28.220 --> 02:44:28.800]
Sorry, Morris.

[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:29.620]
It couldn't be more than that.

[02:44:29.660 --> 02:44:30.540]
But $90 ain't bad.

[02:44:30.820 --> 02:44:31.200]
It's better.

[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:33.020]
Considering it didn't cost him a dime, right?

[02:44:33.020 --> 02:44:33.860]
Right in the kick of the nuts.

[02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:35.980]
Four winners in five weeks.

[02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:37.060]
And a second.

[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:38.500]
Now is it five weeks or six weeks?

[02:44:40.140 --> 02:44:41.120]
We're going to have to have a meeting.

[02:44:41.220 --> 02:44:41.700]
Five weeks.

[02:44:41.980 --> 02:44:42.840]
Four winners in five weeks.

[02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:44.420]
You know, I don't know.

[02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:45.320]
Whatever it is.

[02:44:52.020 --> 02:44:53.040]
Then you get a 21.

[02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:53.560]
What is it?

[02:44:53.820 --> 02:44:54.140]
$27.

[02:44:54.660 --> 02:44:54.980]
$50.

[02:44:55.260 --> 02:44:56.420]
For 21 bucks.

[02:44:56.620 --> 02:44:56.820]
Yeah.

[02:44:58.020 --> 02:44:59.640]
Boy, this is a great way to get rich.

[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:00.740]
Let me tell you that right now.

[02:45:01.080 --> 02:45:01.620]
I you know me.

[02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:01.980]
I don't.

[02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:03.000]
I don't like I can gamble.

[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:06.340]
When we first came to QA,

[02:45:06.340 --> 02:45:07.220]
and I said, oh, we're surrounding

[02:45:07.220 --> 02:45:08.720]
by a bunch of gambling degenerates.

[02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:09.400]
That's right.

[02:45:10.540 --> 02:45:12.480]
I don't see anybody congratulating me on it.

[02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:13.440]
I'm incredible success.

[02:45:13.660 --> 02:45:13.980]
Congratulations.

[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:14.480]
I'm incredible.

[02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:15.940]
This is a fortified favorite.

[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:16.040]

[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:16.040]

[02:45:17.420 --> 02:45:18.220]
Nice going, Neil.

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.920]
Thank you.

[02:45:21.420 --> 02:45:23.180]
Here's one that says, I sent this to.

[02:45:23.700 --> 02:45:24.840]
I sent this to you.

[02:45:24.940 --> 02:45:26.240]
That means I know you're interested in

[02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:27.180]
dieting, rexancizing.

[02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:27.860]
But you know what?

[02:45:27.940 --> 02:45:29.520]
It doesn't even have my name on it.

[02:45:29.740 --> 02:45:31.620]
It doesn't even have my freaking name on it.

[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:32.220]
So go away.

[02:45:33.500 --> 02:45:34.820]
Like that FCC song.

[02:45:34.940 --> 02:45:35.220]
Go away.

[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:35.660]
Go away.

[02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:39.540]
So we made money for Morris.

[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:40.520]
We made money for you.

[02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:42.540]
Surely he's happy because she gave you 40 bucks.

[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:43.280]
What about my shelf?

[02:45:43.380 --> 02:45:44.160]
Did she bring you any cash?

[02:45:44.540 --> 02:45:44.940]
No, no.

[02:45:44.940 --> 02:45:45.580]
She brought me something.

[02:45:45.620 --> 02:45:45.960]
Wow.

[02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:47.280]
She brought you what?

[02:45:48.140 --> 02:45:48.480]
Herself.

[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:49.520]
Oh, yeah.

[02:45:49.700 --> 02:45:50.360]
She gave you your key.

[02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:51.200]
You're looking up at her after the show.

[02:45:51.760 --> 02:45:52.100]
Maybe.

[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:53.880]
George is making some money.

[02:45:54.020 --> 02:45:54.600]
He's getting laid.

[02:45:55.020 --> 02:45:57.780]
Probably somebody brought him a big bag of weed.

[02:45:58.040 --> 02:45:58.760]
It's waiting for me.

[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:00.180]
And the 11 horse and Kent.

[02:46:00.280 --> 02:46:00.900]
Nice ride there.

[02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:01.180]
Kent.

[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:03.000]
Boy, he wrote it like much of the best

[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:03.400]
and he was.

[02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:04.480]
You know what that means?

[02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:05.060]
No.

[02:46:05.400 --> 02:46:06.420]
I'm sure you don't.

[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:07.120]
That's different.

[02:46:07.420 --> 02:46:08.440]
Because you know nothing about it.

[02:46:08.540 --> 02:46:09.600]
You just made six and a half bucks.

[02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:10.520]
You know nothing about it.

[02:46:10.580 --> 02:46:10.800]
Let's go.

[02:46:11.580 --> 02:46:13.220]
Now, see if the beast would listen to me.

[02:46:13.220 --> 02:46:15.020]
I could have had you like a $50 double today.

[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:15.300]
How?

[02:46:15.420 --> 02:46:18.980]
You don't even ever been to the track.

[02:46:18.980 --> 02:46:20.480]
You said you'd been to Suffolk Downs.

[02:46:20.540 --> 02:46:21.060]
Like once.

[02:46:21.980 --> 02:46:24.040]
You should call it place broken downs.

[02:46:24.140 --> 02:46:25.740]
I used to get a flag there a lot when I was in college.

[02:46:26.280 --> 02:46:26.700]
Dog track.

[02:46:27.380 --> 02:46:27.600]
Yeah.

[02:46:28.160 --> 02:46:29.260]
First night I went to Flagler.

[02:46:29.260 --> 02:46:30.160]
I won 700 bucks.

[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:30.580]
Nice.

[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.120]
I had no idea what dog where I was on vacation in Florida.

[02:46:33.340 --> 02:46:36.860]
With my sales manager and his wife from Kalamazoo.

[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:39.680]
And I won 700 bucks.

[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:40.700]
And I thought, boy, this is easy.

[02:46:40.860 --> 02:46:41.440]
It's a piece of cake.

[02:46:41.440 --> 02:46:43.140]
Then the next night we lost our asses.

[02:46:44.060 --> 02:46:45.300]
Lost our asses.

[02:46:45.380 --> 02:46:49.600]
In fact, the dog guy that came where he got bumped and went flying up in the air and hit the ground.

[02:46:51.440 --> 02:46:53.520]
And I'm thinking there's all my money laying on the ground.

[02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:54.760]
What a piece of turd, you know.

[02:46:56.760 --> 02:46:58.500]
We need Eddie K back on the station.

[02:46:58.500 --> 02:46:59.320]
Now, that's the problem.

[02:46:59.420 --> 02:47:00.060]
The A has lost.

[02:47:00.340 --> 02:47:02.100]
The A has lost that whole gambling crowd.

[02:47:02.100 --> 02:47:04.780]
You know, all those old dead guys like Lester Green shirt.

[02:47:06.740 --> 02:47:07.900]
That's what Eddie used to have.

[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:09.880]
He used to have all those oldie, Jennifer Gambers.

[02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:13.180]
What is that?

[02:47:13.340 --> 02:47:14.220]
Oh, me play with my ticket.

[02:47:14.620 --> 02:47:16.780]
Oh, I thought it was a beast going into a coma again.

[02:47:17.460 --> 02:47:20.160]
When I realized this isn't for everybody, but it's a commercial enterprise.

[02:47:20.220 --> 02:47:22.620]
Okay, and Gulfstream pays a lot of money for this to somebody.

[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:25.360]
And you get paid extra for this, George.

[02:47:25.420 --> 02:47:25.960]
I'm sure you do.

[02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:26.520]
Yes, I do.

[02:47:26.540 --> 02:47:27.000]
Well, there you go.

[02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:32.180]
See, not only does it, do I pick him the damn daily double again and make him a six and a half bucks.

[02:47:32.500 --> 02:47:36.460]
Not only does Shirley bring him by for a box out of the blue, which he never expected to see in his life.

[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:38.740]
But also, he gets paid a couple of checkouts to go out there.

[02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:41.180]
Don't forget the free food and the free food.

[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:41.420]
Right.

[02:47:41.900 --> 02:47:43.220]
And the schmooze and the booze.

[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:43.380]
Right.

[02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:44.740]
My God.

[02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:45.780]
What's not to like?

[02:47:46.020 --> 02:47:47.100]
Win, win, win.

[02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:49.120]
Things are really, really looking up.

[02:47:50.260 --> 02:47:54.920]
Now, since March 1st is Sunday and my 33rd anniversary on the Irons out photos on Sunday, March 1,

[02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:58.360]
all weekend long, people can get pouring in with their happy anniversary greetings.

[02:47:58.700 --> 02:47:58.700]

[02:47:59.140 --> 02:48:01.060]
And then the Rogers dot com.

[02:48:01.060 --> 02:48:03.080]
What animated e-cards, things like that?

[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:06.400]
You think you think I'm going to get any response?

[02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:08.040]
I think you otter.

[02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:09.020]
Probably not till Monday.

[02:48:09.260 --> 02:48:11.240]
Monday will be, oh, everybody happy anniversary.

[02:48:11.660 --> 02:48:13.920]
33 is like a special kind of a number, you know?

[02:48:14.180 --> 02:48:14.400]
Is it?

[02:48:14.860 --> 02:48:15.200]
I don't know.

[02:48:15.480 --> 02:48:16.200]
It's a double number.

[02:48:16.500 --> 02:48:17.100]
Larry Birdward.

[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:18.680]
What?

[02:48:21.500 --> 02:48:22.220]
Say what?

[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:23.400]
Larry Birdward.

[02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:26.940]
Oh, how disgusting.

[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:31.420]
One of my least favorite people in the subhuman race, Larry Bird.

[02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:32.100]
What a turd.

[02:48:32.220 --> 02:48:34.080]
You're probably Larry Birdfran because you were from Boston.

[02:48:34.660 --> 02:48:35.880]
You're probably a havela check.

[02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:37.620]
Havela check stole the ball.

[02:48:37.700 --> 02:48:38.100]
Right there.

[02:48:38.100 --> 02:48:38.700]
We was robbed.

[02:48:39.020 --> 02:48:42.760]
Well, I'll tell you if anybody hated Johnny most more than I did, I'd like to know who that person was.

[02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:44.460]
I hated Johnny.

[02:48:44.580 --> 02:48:47.740]
That's why I lived in Boston in early 60s and he was doing the Celtics games on the radio.

[02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:48.900]
We was robbed.

[02:48:49.260 --> 02:48:50.220]
It's one thing to be a homeward.

[02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:51.740]
It's nothing to cry like a child.

[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:52.900]
Baaah.

[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:53.580]
Baaah.

[02:48:53.620 --> 02:48:55.040]
He'd been good in the South Florida Johnny most.

[02:48:55.260 --> 02:48:55.600]
Baaah.

[02:48:56.940 --> 02:48:58.460]
I'll tell you one thing, you know Jimmy Cifilis.

[02:48:58.700 --> 02:49:01.060]
So what do you hear about the Zagaki and Cifilis getting canned?

[02:49:01.620 --> 02:49:01.780]
Beast.

[02:49:01.780 --> 02:49:02.480]
Uh, nothing.

[02:49:04.140 --> 02:49:08.020]
You know, once upon a time way back when, well listen George, here's my best advice.

[02:49:08.140 --> 02:49:09.360]
Don't spend it all in one place.

[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:09.760]
Be wait.

[02:49:10.220 --> 02:49:11.800]
You're listening to Neil Rogers.

[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:12.980]
I got you, you're a gem.

[02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:14.100]
I'm still Rogers God.

[02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:16.140]
New from the makers of Tic Tacs.

[02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:18.660]
In association with antibiotics anytime enterprises.

[02:49:19.220 --> 02:49:21.900]
It's the new A-R-Tic Tacs.

[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:23.980]
A-R-Tic Tacs.

[02:49:24.100 --> 02:49:25.900]
You're homeward and that's the best.

[02:49:26.100 --> 02:49:26.540]
Hey Dad.

[02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:28.840]
I've been taking the new A-R-Tic Tacs.

[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:30.280]
I can't wait to little exarts.

[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:33.900]
We got those from our cousin in the Dominican Republic.

[02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:35.360]
Don't tell the other kids.

[02:49:35.700 --> 02:49:36.640]
Oh, okay.

[02:49:36.980 --> 02:49:38.500]
So it's a big secret, didn't we?

[02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:40.000]
Yeah, it's a big secret.

[02:49:40.460 --> 02:49:44.320]
So give me a new Xbox 360 there.

[02:49:44.580 --> 02:49:45.020]
What?

[02:49:45.580 --> 02:49:46.700]
Do it while it's still.

[02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:48.160]
Don't make me angry.

[02:49:48.580 --> 02:49:50.400]
You will want me to pay you.

[02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:53.020]
Okay, okay, whatever you say.

[02:49:54.680 --> 02:49:56.840]
Hey, Rod, take test.

[02:49:56.840 --> 02:49:59.000]
You're homeward and that's the best.

[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:00.800]
Hey Rod, Tic Tacs.

[02:50:00.820 --> 02:50:04.060]
Available now from a guy in the locker room of your local gem.

[02:50:04.420 --> 02:50:06.100]
But don't tell anybody.

[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:07.340]
You're the boots for inquiry.

[02:50:09.900 --> 02:50:11.800]
Oh, that sounded like the...

[02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:12.160]
Hey, great.

That's why we are South Florida Sports Leader.

[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:25.840]

[02:50:54.300 --> 02:50:57.140]
Senior Jack Ed from home.

[02:50:57.500 --> 02:51:00.820]
Here he is, our income suit and for dawn.

[02:51:02.880 --> 02:51:04.120]
You're fair with me.

[02:51:04.140 --> 02:51:07.320]
He's screwed a lot of people for things.

[02:51:07.840 --> 02:51:09.500]
Sometimes get count.

Seeing good Christian Thompson?

[02:51:30.020 --> 02:51:34.440]
Will he more or less be around their town?

[02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:41.660]
He's not too thick together but should be before he's gone.

[02:51:42.860 --> 02:51:46.360]
Taking a shower with his son.

[02:51:49.540 --> 02:51:55.120]
Averson Island is what the White House is playing for.

[02:51:55.720 --> 02:52:03.780]
A powerless Christian to know what's best for you and me.

[02:52:04.280 --> 02:52:07.600]
Aigre of all that is.

[02:52:09.180 --> 02:52:14.040]
He was in the sun, deep in the woods.

[02:52:14.040 --> 02:52:14.800]
He's the only one here.

[02:52:14.800 --> 02:52:14.940]
He's the only one here.

[02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:21.840]
He's the only one here.

[02:52:21.860 --> 02:52:23.100]
He's the only one here.

[02:52:23.100 --> 02:52:24.720]
He's the only one here.

[02:52:24.720 --> 02:52:32.060]
He's the only one here.

[02:52:34.760 --> 02:52:41.180]
Averson Island is what the White House is playing for.

[02:52:41.180 --> 02:52:42.920]
Bye!
