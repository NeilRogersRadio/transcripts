[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.900]
So I can't do the show, but I want to do it live?

[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:03.940]
No.

[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:04.920]
I will.

[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.800]
What do you mean you can't do in the show?

[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.940]
Well, I brought up the, you know, what do you call it?

[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.460]
The audio ball.

[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.860]
And like a show, it just played, it's gone.

[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.060]
And I have to go find it.

[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.760]
What do you mean it played, it's gone?

[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.340]
That's what it's looking like.

[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.540]
You know, but I don't even know what it's called.

[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.300]
So hey, well screw it, it's what I said.

[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.900]
I say a Roger show and don't call.

[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.080]
If you're okay, then you call it.

[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.760]
Don't call on school.

[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.240]
He'll be on the field and he'll like it that way.

[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.580]
If Owen, T-A-Y, S-R-C-K-S.

[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.680]
This portion of the show brought to you by Britney Spears, the J-J.

[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.760]
It's hanging out, y'all.

[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.440]
It's 10-0-1 at 5'60-W-D-Q-A-M-C. I played a short, real short bit.

[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.340]
I love that one.

[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.080]
I don't know why.

[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.060]
Because it says Mews.

[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.980]
It's amusing.

[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.920]
Right, I'm used rhymes with the Bews and let me just make a little bit of announcement here.

[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.400]
Play Mews use.

[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.240]
No, seriously, what I told you this morning is the truth and that is we do not show up here every day

[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.220]
to be abused by idiots.

[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.940]
Okay, that's not the purpose of the show.

[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.280]
It's to take abuse.

[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.920]
I know there comes a great shock to a lot of idiots.

[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.240]
Oh, we sure busted his balls.

[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.040]
We sure screwed up the show.

[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.460]
We don't come here to take abuse every day.

[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.740]
That's a management's job.

[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.140]
And there's a certain number of people out there who think that that's why we're here is to take abuse from them

[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.920]
on emails on the phone calls and speaking to the phone calls,

[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.620]
Ricky Tiki, shot of all people under my space.

[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.480]
And he's one of the very few who's using that anymore, I guess, at least with me.

[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.140]
He sent me an email that I'm going to, it's from the real Rick Shaw because it's under my space page,

[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.560]
which I will read in a couple of minutes and it just frosted my fat ass.

[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.500]
I mean, you know, he's entitled to his opinion.

[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.560]
Right?

[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.060]
Yeah.

[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.880]
I don't care about his opinion about the calls and the caller.

[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.180]
I'm not doing that.

[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.340]
I'm not doing the show to please people who want to abuse it.

[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.480]
There's no point in it.

[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.560]
And these people are trying to pretend that there's some redeeming value of my taking calls.

[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.140]
There's not.

[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.660]
There absolutely is not.

[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.800]
I've stopped.

[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.400]
I've started.

[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.900]
I've stopped.

[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.020]
I've shut it off.

[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.720]
I've opened it up.

[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.180]
And it's crap.

[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.020]
I'm your friend.

[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.360]
And then this radio station doesn't give a crap about it.

[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.740]
They think it's, you know, I don't know what they think.

[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.520]
They just don't care.

[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.080]
They don't care.

[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.480]
They don't care.

[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.540]
Well, we don't have the ability to either.

[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.960]
You don't have the ability to do anything.

[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.320]
And so within the parameters of what we've got to work with, we're doing,

[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.760]
or I'm doing the best I can.

[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.300]
When George is on, there's your calls.

[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.180]
He loves it.

[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.760]
And they don't abuse him as much as they want to abuse me.

[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.180]
They like George a lot better.

[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.640]
Yeah.

[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.840]
Well, I think they like you more.

[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.300]
And that's why.

[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.280]
No, they know those people.

[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.020]
No, those people don't like me.

[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.700]
Those people just want to destroy the show.

[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.080]
This is how they do it.

[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.100]
Anyway, for example, speaking of abuse, here's, here's one that came in on, let's see.

[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.520]
Well, this is from a week ago.

[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.940]
Wow.

[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.320]
At least it's dated a week.

[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.860]
You I'm sure it's not, that's not the right date.

[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.200]
Neil, we obviously do not see you eating.

[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.280]
We hear you eating.

[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.220]
And it is the insistent lips smacking tongue noises that are annoying.

[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.060]
It's kind of gross.

[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.780]
How often do I eat on the air, especially now that I'm here?

[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.600]
Maybe two, three times a year.

[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.500]
I'll look, we need, or something in there, very, very rarely.

[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.300]
And yet, here's, this is from Kevin, whoever Kevin is.

[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.240]
Would you like to just sit there and hear other people eat?

[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.920]
Do what you want, but it's like fingernails on the blackboard.

[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.020]
Well, you got the, the first part of that is right.

[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.100]
I've got to do what you want, and I will.

[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.780]
How do you like that?

[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.140]

[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.680]
Yeah, shocking is right.

[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.320]
Do what you want, but it's like, I mean, talk about making an issue out of nothing.

[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.400]
Then I eat a couple of weenies on the air a couple times the year.

[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.380]
Jordan, and the fact that George eats on the air with a food comes in on Thursday.

[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.300]
That's part of the show.

[00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.720]
Sure.

[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.020]
I'd try some nuts.

[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.300]
That's part of the promotion is that the George eats on the air.

[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.860]
Smacking, you know, that's a big deal with that.

[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.840]
It's because they don't have any material.

[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.460]
This is, this is it.

[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.780]
That's all we're going to get.

[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.240]
That was up to an 11 points.

[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.180]
Yeah, it's all we're going to get today.

[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.900]
I'll say that over the weekend and today's slim and grim.

[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.900]
I'm looking on there right now.

[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.280]
There was a long puff piece about Paul and old Ron,

[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.460]
which if anybody thinks I'm reading that, you're dreaming.

[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.380]
You're a crazy person.

[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.200]
Puff piece about castrenova and Ron Brewer.

[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.580]
That's another thing.

[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.840]
Do they think that this show is here just for the purpose of the show?

[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.480]
The purpose of promoting other shows in the market.

[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.480]
Is that what we're all here for?

[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.340]
That to take abuse.

[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.140]
Promote other shows.

[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.340]
Take other shows.

[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.380]
Promote other shows.

[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.380]
Jesus, God Almighty.

[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.800]
And today is the day that they're going to slip the Mickey to the people.

[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.360]
And you know something?

[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.740]
I've decided I don't care.

[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.660]
I don't live in Dave County.

[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.340]
I don't own a property in Dave County.

[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.320]
And you people in Dave County, good luck to you.

[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.460]
You get what you deserve.

[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.440]
You were like these crooks over and over again.

[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.660]
And then they keep slipping the Mickey to you.

[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.760]
And the first it was the Mickey arena, which we needed like a hole in the head.

[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.100]
See, we had each, each egomaniac had a have his own arena.

[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.680]
Wayne had a have his arena and Broward.

[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.340]
And Mickey had a have his arena and Dave.

[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.940]
The fact that you got two teams that play in an indoor arena,

[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.940]
like the main beliefs in the arachios, for example.

[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.420]
I couldn't play in the same arena.

[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.840]
Could they?

[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.940]
No.

[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.660]
I'm not sure about some of the other ones, like the Bruins and the Celtics.

[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.920]
I don't know where the Celtics play.

[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.500]
I'm sure it must be in the same arena.

[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.800]
A lot of major markets that have basketball and hockey teams

[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.740]
they play in the same arena.

[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.480]
Oh, no, we couldn't have that.

[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.600]
We got to have our own arena for the heat, the heat, hoops and heat and hoops and hoops.

[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.400]
Right.

[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.680]
Because there's such fantastic interest in it.

[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.140]
Not.

[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.500]
Well, there'll be another hundred years before the NCAA plays any basketball games in Miami.

[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.280]
I'll guarantee you that.

[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.820]
Boy, you talk about crowds.

[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.520]
Woo.

[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.680]
There's no interest in college basketball and stuff.

[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.180]
But I mean, betting on the NCAAs, everybody's got their card, everybody's, you know.

[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.700]
I got my brackets filled out.

[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.180]
What a racket, the brackets.

[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.120]
And George didn't get in on this year.

[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.300]
He has to do it.

[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.340]
That was up to 21 points.

[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.080]
What's that all about?

[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.520]
Or making a big comeback or what?

[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.360]
First of all.

[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.220]
It's just an aberration.

[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.120]
Hold in my breath.

[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.800]
Okay, here's the real richaw on my space.

[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.400]
Subject, happy birthday.

[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.720]
First of all, I don't know what that means, happy birthday.

[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.160]
Did he mean happy anniversary, too?

[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:44.240]
Did he also get suckered in by that idea that because it says in my space, the show's birthday is March 1st.

[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.540]
Must have.

[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.760]
I don't know.

[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.960]
You're confused, Rick.

[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.700]
I think the sonility is finally set in too many long talk-ups.

[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.260]
Hey, Neil and George, greetings to you both.

[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.060]
It's been a while.

[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.580]
Retirement is a wonderful thing.

[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.520]
I've continued to be a faithful listener and offer my two cents on the collar issue.

[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.220]
I didn't know there wasn't an issue anymore.

[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.320]
When's the last time I took a call on the show?

[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.860]
How many hundred years ago?

[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.280]
I don't know.

[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:08.640]
Long time ago.

[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.560]
Am I planning on taking any today?

[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.620]
No.

[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.360]
No.

[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.520]
Anyway, Rickie says I must admit that there's something missing when you show off the call's entirely.

[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.760]
There's something missing.

[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.000]
Oh, my God.

[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.460]
Yeah, aggravation and stress.

[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.820]
That's the only thing that's missing.

[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:31.120]
As inane as many of them are, the chemistry between you and the idiots is quite often hysterical.

[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.020]
No, no, it's not.

[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.260]
There's no chemistry between am you afraid or George is gay and hanging up the phone.

[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.700]
There's nothing to say there.

[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.900]
It's something that doesn't translate through emails in my space and now twitters.

[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.720]
I think people have become so enthralled with computers in the web they spend twice as much time

[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.100]
or more than it would take to pick up the phone and talk to each other.

[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.500]
There's something to be said for actually talking to somebody instead of just reading what they think they think.

[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.780]
If they're superarticulate, they've got an edge.

[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.380]
They can express themselves in writing.

[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.700]
If not, something important can't get lost in the translation and that puts them in a big disadvantage.

[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.700]
If they're superarticulate, they're callers.

[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.780]
I'm your friend.

[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:13.900]
Hi, Ron.

[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.580]
How about we be in a...

[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.300]
Here's the interesting part of what he says.

[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.680]
As though I'm asking him to consult programming on the show.

[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.960]
How about we meet halfway and do a few calls with a few emails.

[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.040]
Now I'm not meeting halfway.

[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.660]
I didn't ask you for a critique or ask you to program the show with all due respect.

[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.680]
As we both know, radio is an art form requiring constant tweaking and adjustment.

[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.520]
That's right and that's why I'm still on the air here 33 years later.

[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.440]
Because I tweak and I adjust. I adjust and I tweak.

[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.640]
I listen to some of my old air checks from the 60s.

[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.240]
I'm QA and I say, how the hell did that pull a 54-year?

[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.660]
That was then. This is now. What worked in those days is almost hysterical today.

[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.500]
I suppose that's progress.

[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.780]
At any rate, I continue to enjoy you and as a fill in Georgia is better than most people doing this every day.

[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.840]
My best to you both and next time you're in town for a weekend dinner's on me.

[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.620]
You pick the place, the real rich Shaw.

[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.580]
How about we meet halfway?

[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.920]
What does that mean? Like Boston or maybe?

[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.560]
No, no, just what does that mean? We meet halfway.

[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.880]
Like I'm negotiating with him to.

[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.020]
I'm negotiating with Rick Shaw to program the show.

[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.960]
I don't want to. I'm not saying I'll never take calls again, any but pretty unlikely.

[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.820]
And if we run out of emails any day and believe me, there's some days when I really have my doubts like today.

[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:50.580]
But if we do, I'll spend some wax like George. I'll play some marginal group that nobody ever heard of.

[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.300]
There you go. Or I'll just play the same bet.

[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.960]
This portion of the show brought to you by Britney Spears, the JJ. It's hanging out, y'all.

[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.500]
Over and over again. The whole four hours.

[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.420]
And still be more entertaining than I'm your friend.

[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.200]
It's interesting. He's making a great argument against his own argument.

[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.900]
He's saying that as time goes on, we have to change. We have to fine tune. We have to.

[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:22.460]
That's right. And over the years, that's one of the reasons I've survived as long as that I've had enough common sense to realize when some things are finished.

[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:28.860]
Some things are done. Like back when I smit canned the guests. Oh, God, those boring guests.

[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:37.900]
Same ponderous monotone boring people saying the same boring monotone crap. It got really ponderous.

[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.740]
And the same with the calls. The calls are finished. I told you a long time ago, the calls are finished.

[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:53.600]
Did I tell you that? Yes, you did. Just like sports talk radio. It's basically in spite of the fact that this market has got like a sickness.

[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.160]
Sickness with sports talk. It's done. It's been done for awhile now.

[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:11.140]
When you take the two major stations, us and the idiots across the street and the only sports show, a led sports show that's getting a number is the master.

[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:21.600]
Who doesn't do a sports show? Talk about the same boring ponderous drew Rosenhausen, Ira Windbag and Alex Marvez.

[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:31.740]
These people could put a Mexican jumping be to sleep. Oh, my God. Give me a breath. That's just my opinion. I mean, what do I know? I don't know much.

[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:40.840]
I don't know nothing about this business. We got experts like Rick Shaw and Charlie Joe Bell. Maybe they're the same person. Oh, sorry, Rick. That was a shot.

[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.420]
Maybe they got the same fat ass. I don't know.

[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:57.860]
I didn't check when Rick came by Gulfstream last summer, whether he had, you know, big fat ass. I didn't check. He's a great guy and we appreciate his coming by, but I'm not I'm not soliciting programming advice for him or for anybody else.

[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:06.660]
I mean, feel free to go ahead and send it. It'll kill some time to read that stuff. You know, let's meet halfway and you do this and I'll do that. Now everybody will be happy. Yeah.

[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:23.400]
It's shocking is what it is. Really shocked, especially coming from him. Now, maybe you can tell me after the break, you can tell me what the redeeming value is of these those calls that I get.

[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:35.520]
Okay. Think about it. All right. Put on your stinking cap. Okay. Come up with some real contrived crap. Okay. You got it. 1013 at 560 WQM.

[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.080]
Yeah.

[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.000]
Yeah.

[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.900]
Yeah.

[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:59.520]
Oh, man. I sure am.

[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.560]
Never saw that. I'm coming to me.

[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.480]
I think I can even do some poor.

[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:17.480]
Yeah.

[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.140]
Yeah.

[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:30.460]
Yeah.

[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.020]
Yeah.

[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:47.680]
Oh boy. 1018 at 560 WQM. And then if that's isn't bad enough to get Rick Shaw giving me programming advice, George during the break sends me a text message.

[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:56.700]
Did we miss a live spot during that first break? Well, I must have blinked. I did the costume spot about the Florida Derby on Saturday and about.

[00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:04.640]
Okay. What? I said, okay. What were you doing when I was doing that spot? I was right here thinking and answering my question about the redeeming value of those callers.

[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:12.580]
That's what I was doing. And what's the answer? Well, first of all, if you're going to argue with things that I never said, you know, go ahead because I never said that you should go back to taking calls.

[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:25.460]
You never just said you hate the email. You never know. No, no, no. I didn't say I hated the emails. I said a crank is a crank and a chronic is a chronic. Whether they're calling or whether they're writing. And why are you writing an email for reading an email from a chronic crank?

[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:34.980]
Might as well hear them reading their own material. No, or you. Well, to me, it's all the same. A crank is a crank and a chronic is a chronic. And I wouldn't humor them on the phone and I wouldn't humor them.

[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:42.240]
I got news for if I didn't read the chronics on the emails, we wouldn't have enough material to do to a sad commentary. Well, it is. That's the truth like this morning.

[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:49.500]
Neil at Neil Rogers dot com. We even have the link to the thing right on our website. And there's there's nothing right now.

[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:56.320]
I mean, I got a couple in my pile, not too many. And there's nothing on there right now. Just a whole bunch of poll suggestions from days and days ago.

[00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:03.200]
And that's it. There is nothing new. You know, for years, I think it regard to Ricky Shaw and that thing I read, nothing regard to anything.

[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:13.240]
Nothing in regard to the fact that the date County commission is going to approve that statement this afternoon and that the people in date County are going to get to shaft again. Nobody cares about that.

[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:18.860]
And I'm not going to get excited about anymore. The county in my mind is, you know, it's a lot of proposition.

[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:27.440]
I mean, a bunch of people have sit around a bunch of crooks who sit around. They decide what's going to happen and where the tax dollars are going to go and what's, but it will.

[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:37.840]
But it will. And that's it. That's the way it works. Just like at the airport, everything is crooked. Everything is corrupt. And that's why it's always been. That's why it always will be. And I can sit here and.

[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:51.360]
I'm going to change the world. Great. Now you're cutting out. And now you're going to. Okay. So I'm still waiting for you to tell me about the value of the colors when I do the show.

[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.920]
I never said that you should take calls. Yeah. I never said that.

[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:08.080]
What do you say you would think about and explain it to me? Yeah. Well, the difference is, see, when we started when I started between the difference between the calls and emails, I'm asking you the redeeming value of the.

[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:19.160]
The call value you take in calls as opposed to emails. When you take a call, you know exactly which mouth breathing idiot it is. And you hang up on them. When I started doing the show with you years ago, I didn't understand why you wouldn't take calls from these

[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:32.120]
chronics. The guy with the eyes and the fanny pet guy and Gilbert and all these people that you would just hang up on when you would first hear their voice. I didn't understand why they called all the time. It would fill the four hours on each any one of them would fill the four hours with their chatter.

[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:48.760]
If you let them and I didn't understand why you hung up on them. And I didn't understand why you would say things like chronics or the death. Nell of a radio show. I didn't know I would come to understand that. And you're absolutely right because they're idiots. And they don't have anything to say as sucking or talking about some other radio show or something like that. That's all they've got.

[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:58.860]
So of course I understood immediately why after a while. You know you wouldn't take calls from these people. But now you're reading the emails from these very same people.

[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:08.060]
How do you know they're from the same people? Because they're saying the same crap because they're saying the same crap that you would hang up on and you would say I'm not interested in that and you would hang up on them.

[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.980]
Obviously it's the same people.

[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:22.400]
Obviously we got a whole new audience because you're starting to read email now. So now we have a whole new audience and a whole new bunch of people participating because you're reading emails that it take calls.

[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:28.000]
You think that there's a different crowd of people out there because you're reading email. No, I think there's a different crowd. I think they're all different chronics.

[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:33.160]
The Pete know that the same chronics and the same cranks writing the same crap that you wouldn't listen to on the air when it was.

[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:47.520]
Let me tell you this. At the end of each day when two o'clock comes I have a feeling in my brain and my bowels in my body about whether the show was good, bad and different whether I enjoyed it, whether I wanted the show to be.

[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:56.440]
And since I've gone to the emails, I'm much, much happier about the way the show has gone and much happier about the January trend by the way, which was through the roof.

[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:07.020]
Yeah, now that I got Schmidt candy's callers once and for all and when a guy like Rick Schroster, it's something all the same old crap that Joe Bell talks about all the interaction between you and the callers is really special.

[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:19.200]
There is no interaction between somebody that you're hanging up on 100 times today. That's not interaction. Right. I couldn't agree more. I mean once upon a time I understand that when we had living, breathing people call.

[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:31.520]
Right. Most of them still idiots, but at least there was some way to interact when you're talking about something specific, something that they can respond to. Those people will be there, but then so will the other people. I got one for the poll. I got one for the poll building is boring.

[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:41.520]
There's no. How many of those do I delete on the emails that never make it to the air, by the way, is that yeah. Over the weekend, almost everything I got. Well, here's one for the poll.

[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:56.420]
Hey, then. Here's one from Bob. I agree with Rick Shaw. Some of the biggest lives in the history of your show have been when you respond to the indeed callers with your florid insults. I hope you reconsider.

[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:09.420]
Release take a few calls. No, Bob. No. The only people who want me to take calls are the chronic callers themselves and Rick Shaw and Bob. I agree with Rick Shaw. You agree all you want.

[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:20.740]
Call them up at home. Have a nice chat about how the show has gone to the gone to the dog since Neil stop taking those great calls. The call part of my show is over. It's finished. It's done.

[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:30.460]
And a big part of that is on the shoulders of a beastly broadcasting because they won't they won't support this show. They won't let the finger. No.

[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:46.840]
They do anything for this show. Nothing. Nope. And so we don't get any cooperation. In fact, I think Rick Shaw should have written to me. I'm not going to put words in his mouth or anything else. But we know it's a mirror. I don't need him to kiss my ass, but it is a miracle that we're still on the air.

[00:19:48.420 --> 00:20:07.960]
They've thrown every roadblock, every monkey wrench in a way of this show to try to destroy it, to try to ruin it. Right. Well, they want to play this and you can't say that and you can't do this. We won't help you with the phone. We want and whatever. And we're cutting your salary in half. And we're not going to guarantee any talent fees and blah, blah, blah, blah. And just screw you as much as we can. We're still here.

[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:29.460]
And we still have the highest ratings on this and with a signal signal that you can't hear it. You're sitting under the tower. You can't hear it. I think it's getting worse by the day, by the way. Yeah. Well, there you go. Everybody I run into. What the hell happened to your signal? What the hell happened to the signal? Why can't I hear the show? We are fading from the face of the earth. And yet we still manage to eke out. Some kind of a number.

[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:53.020]
So keep this in mind. Friday I said, AMC was slipping. We needed more Godfather. All we can long. Godfather. And I watched it. And you watched it. I watched it over and over and over again. And in our house, it's like the Rocky Horror picture show. We're doing like lines right along with the character and you know, she's got to scrap out.

[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:11.160]
Here's the award winning schedule. We got to big O at two. Mad Dog 4 to 7. Dolphin tonight. 708. Wow. DA 8 to 9. The 9 to 1. The WBC championship from the XPM radio. What is the WBC? World.

[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:32.260]
World. Volshmet championship. I don't know. Something. Something with a B baseball basketball. Bungie ball. The world baseball classic. Whatever that is. No, no, we're carrying that crap again. Oh my God. Wow. All you fenneth waylands and part of weekends get all whipped up about that. I don't know who's still playing.

[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:45.900]
I have no idea who's saying I'm sure nobody cares. Plus it's on TV for free. But we got it from ESPN radio 9 o'clock tonight. So we should have missed that 1026 at 560 WQ. Let me.

[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:59.440]
Neon God. Here he comes. We get off the street. Or you might have you. Like a piece of me. Oh, right.

[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:44.500]
Oh, right. Now I want him dead. Oh, no, it's a monkey. He's terrorized in my hometown. Someone break in a machine gun. And what the championship down. Oh, no, it's a monkey. A smaller version of old King Kong. Oh, why are they in my house? Can't imagine what could go wrong.

[00:22:47.260 --> 00:23:14.200]
1031 at 560 WQ and let's see tonight's the final game of the WBC the world baseball classic. Japan versus Korea informs the Rudy. He says PS don't take calls. And I won't. But Paul Smith says listen to Ricky Tickey. He's a great broadcaster. You could learn a lot from him. You need to funny up your show. It's Stale and needs fine tuning. Don't be a foolish old man. Listen to Rick. Yeah, Stale and needs fine tuning. I wonder which of the chronic callers Paul Smith is. Right.

[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:43.580]
Paul Smith Joe Bell at inbox dot com. Right. Right. Yeah. He's a great person. It's Jackie. Great. This Jackie legendary. And that's all well and good. Do you do a talk show? No. I think you should take his advice and wear a hat. Yeah, that's a good idea. Where were best. I get that one from Dion that he used to wear all the time. Right. Same genre. Like a captain's hat, although without the lint.

[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.700]
I'm trying to think when Ricky Tickey came, I'm sure he did. He had the cap on when it came by Gulfstream.

[00:23:52.260 --> 00:24:12.900]
Don't remember, Dan. I do. You do? He always wears that cap. I think he wears it to bed. Trade Mark probably. Oh, that does come off. How do you know that? I took it off of his head and posed with a picture of it on my video. Yeah, I did. You took Ricky Tickey's cap off his head. Yep. Rosemary says George needs to smoke a joint in chill out. Maybe he didn't get any this weekend.

[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:27.900]
That was up 268. See Obama bounce. Haven't heard from Maria B in a long time. Wow. Maybe she's turned on us to that bitch. That bag. I'd bitch. She's gone.

[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:37.080]
And of course, all of our chronic state disappeared. So you complained about the chronic. I like the chronic on the email. Okay.

[00:24:37.080 --> 00:25:05.640]

The fake Greg Vidal, the fake Larry King. That's all the same dude. Yeah. And. And. But it's material. Don't you understand? It's stuff. It's not. Jesus. Haven't you been doing this long? I know. If that's not something you can. You can. It's like Plano. It's stuff in nonsense. Well, that's this show. Man. Stuff in nonsense.

Nankosha Hotdog insights rage at Jewish eatery. Here's a good one. Restaurant order brandish electric knife to fend off outrage customers. This is a good story. You see, there's something worthwhile. And you're giving me crap about the name emails. Oh, no, the emails all suck. It's all the same. Yeah, that's what I said.

[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:59.160]
Here's one that says in response to George's assertion, we're all the same deep bag chronics that ruined your show with her. Incessant retarded calls. I am not one of them. I started listening to your show toward the end of the calls. Did not ever call in due to part to the shyness and part to intimidation. Now I can email whenever thoughts I have on a subject. And you can be the judge. If it's worth your not. Thanks, Neil God. Do Shnazzle Chris. See, there's a good guy. Do Shnazzle Chris. I didn't say all the emails were from chronic. Yeah, you said it. Obviously the same people. It's exactly what you said. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

Talk about other radio show that are You're not going to Christmas? How much time did you used to spend talking about the Steve K Hansch? All these other shows that nobody cares about. But all those the chronics. The. the Fakes. That's all they talk about. I talk about the Steve K chell. They do see. You don't you don't understand. I don't read those. Just like the one about the Paul Ron show. There was a.

[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:48.300]
The real swill. Thank God. Here's George again on a cranky Monday, man. I'm going back to bed

[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.440]

[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:13.360]
How much I won what I did but it beat and I screw these people with no lives who want to live I curiously through my boring life

[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.760]
Oh, Neil

[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:21.400]
Why don't you talk more about your life there? They're not that much to tell you okay? I'm doing the best I can for an old fool

[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.000]

You tell me about your boring life and here with the fake joy Reynolds has to say

[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.740]
Well, we haven't got anything from the fake joy Reynolds how do you like that?

[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:38.120]
Good Mr. Contrary Mr. Argumentative Mr. I didn't get any good weed this weekend or get laid. That's not true as a Rosemary said yeah

Here's one from Sam. Oh, not Sam

[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:47.720]
Over the years I've called in under 10 times in the emailing arrow within one year

[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:53.080]
I've emailed you about a dozen times seems that people would not call for any number of reasons choose to email to communicate with you

[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.740]
I think George is about 20% correct on this issue

[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.600]
PS George is improving you had Lucy Lopez in the background like the bird

[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.700]
Background filler and his voice kept a normal tone as opposed to the hyped out fast-talking helium voice

[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:12.500]
He usually has when she's present way to go at George. Thanks Sam see there's somebody like a little little pat on the back

[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.220]
Here's one from Barry Jackass. I've been listening just nothing to report lately

Thanks to the fake or real Barry whichever one it was there's a lot of information we've gotten about for example

[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:40.820]
We were I think first to tell everybody 940 was going all sports. We were on top of all this crap the bubble crap

[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.400]
Bubble crap. Yeah, the bubble a 93 point whatever it is

[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.900]
We've been at the forefront of a lot of crap because we're getting stuff whether it's the real well

[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:56.200]
What differences make whether it's a real Barry Jackass or somebody else on the inside who knows what's going on?

[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.720]
What difference does it make? Oh, none well there you go

Then grill it on an open flame with muskete smoked billowing into the atmosphere

[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:09.200]
Add some syslin habanero sauce so hot it can melt the polar ice caps all by itself

He was ponderous reminiscing about the old pantheres not as ponderous as the performance by your panthers

[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:58.200]
By the way losing the Columbus 3-1 two more points flush down the toilet

[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:17.320]
If only

[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.820]
They have nothing to say that would be the only other to my space whatever the medium anything and that's that's the problem

[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:30.660]
Anyway, here's the poor result from Friday boy sure took a long time to get around to this the now's up 261

Don't know. There's silly Canadians is any I

[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:10.140]
Thought there was a difference is it there's a difference between the Bob sled and the Bob slay and a sleigh

Bob sled Bob slay I sled is something that you just slide down hill with and I slay is for the reindeer slay is

[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.880]
Pulled by something like a reindeer or a horse

[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:42.480]
Oh

[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:47.640]
Barry Jackets said Sid was on with I miss this morning. He has interviews with stations in Vegas and Atlantic City

[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:53.020]
Well, isn't that great? Oh, and here's a picture of him in a bathing suit. Oh gross wow

[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.560]
Jesus said the kid in a bathing suit. That's from Sid

[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:03.460]
Oh, here's the fake Scott for well the real Scott for well said the texted Georgia smart said tell me I said

[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:03.740]
I

[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:11.460]
He was the beginning of the end for this radio station by the way for real. I thought it was Howard

[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:15.520]
No, Howard Howard was after for real. I wasn't I forget

[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:20.560]
After they got fined for for real and their license was in grave jeopardy

[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:26.340]
They came up with a brilliant idea endorsed by Joyce by the way. Oh, let's put the stern sure on here with 100 dump buttons

[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.760]
Have dust sitting in there have a nervous breakdown with 4000 dump buttons

[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.280]
like

[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:33.980]
that

[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.020]
And

[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.260]
That worked out real well too didn't it? Yeah

[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.620]
How many hundred years before we finally got our license back

[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:50.320]
Nice going Greg Reed and Joyce and and the whole beastly clan man you people are geniuses

[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.580]
It's like if you get a speeding ticket

[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:55.640]
for going 90 miles an hour

[00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:02.500]
In a 60 zone or 55 zone and then and then they lose your license and then see the side the next weekend

[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.600]
You're gonna go and go 120

[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.880]
That's what putting stern on here was like I remember I was at wood buying that day how unusual

[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:14.380]
And my blackberry was bzzzz buzzing and it was clearance

[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.040]
Clarence and I went outside so I could hear what he was mumbling about

[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.800]
Yeah, and that's the day told me about the stern thing

[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:28.160]
And of course at that point they had never even considered well

[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:34.640]
What are we gonna do about then the fast stern goes way over past 10 o'clock and some days goes to 11 and the kneels contracts as he's on 10 to 2

[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.740]
What are we gonna do about that

[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.980]
Remember the source the grief that was caused by that boy do we ever

[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:43.540]
Remember yep

[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:50.640]
But that's the way they do things not slow enough fast just absolutely half fast

[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.460]
That's the way the beastly people do crap

[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:59.420]
Oh, let's do it on there. I'm in and of course Greg was giving Barry jackass. I'm intrigued by the possibility

[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:04.780]
He's intrigued he's it was intrigued by the possibility of blowing the license down the toilet that would have been good

[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:12.520]
What did I tell him about stern and sure enough the first day that the show was on the year somebody had filed by before 10 o'clock

[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:17.240]
Somebody already filed three complaints with the FCC right the first day that we carried the show right yep

[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.880]
The same somebody we knew I knew was gonna be going nuts

[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.820]
I remember you warning them. I don't know if you do

[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:31.880]
What you warned them? Yeah, and of course their attitude was oh, well, what is Neil? No, you know, he's such a sour old fart fag everything

[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:36.780]
We've ever said they've had this stuff like hiring fat boy whatever we say they'll do the opposite wrong. It's wrong

[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.100]
Because they're the experts we know nothing

[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:47.140]
Well, this is sure been a real sour hour, you know what? What are you talking about? This is great radio

[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.480]
It's compelling

[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.240]
Oh, is it thank God I blocked him

[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.800]
Wow, where's the one where they're all been out of shape I'll get to the hot dog thing

[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:04.680]
oh, yeah, I got a whole bunch of stuff here good

[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.640]
Oh, yeah, here it is Rick and dear field beaches. I listen

[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.200]
I've noted more infighting between you and George if anything is going to destroy your show

[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.000]
It's the bickering between you two like tool hags

[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:20.140]
I know you don't like advice, but how about a bit more variety in the show through on some email some commentary and some live calls

[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:25.480]
Varieties more interesting. Glow out your ass Rick. Yeah. How about this? How about that? No

[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:30.280]
See in Rick Shaw start all this I never should have even read that read that stupid email. That's right

[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:36.780]
Everything was going along just fine and now they're starting with a call here. How about more variety do this do that? No

[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.780]
More show advice more critiques

[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:46.680]
How do you say it complaints and critiques complaints and critiques and show advice and life advice yep

[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.240]
This is the neo-roger show

[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:52.960]
This is your brain

[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:59.500]
Any question this portion of the show brought to you by Britney Spears the JJ

[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.740]
It's hanging out y'all

[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.220]
I love it 0 2 at 560. I'm just playing that every break I think

[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.540]
Please do

[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.860]
Over in fact, I what I'm going to do is just play it all day a whole four hours

[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:14.740]
Can I take some calls this portion of the show, but maybe not

[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:20.880]
Oh Justin says Neil the demise you're the demise of WQM with your pathetic bickering balschmit

[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:27.220]
That's why Justin's listening because I'm a pathetic bickering balschmitter. They love it. Yeah, that's your bell

[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.140]
Mm-hmm

[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:33.040]
Ignore mistake about it. That's jolly joe bell sending that in that would explain a lot

[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:40.680]
What do you mean by that joe bell writing a lot of these fake emails? Oh, what else you got to do right?

[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.500]
I

[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:48.120]
Mean he can quote chapter and verse everything that's on his show. So he obviously is like you know listening to the show for hours

[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.220]
I just don't get it

[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:56.920]
Getting paid to listen to this show or maybe he's the monitor there you are monitoring you I'm monitoring you

[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.120]
Who was that

[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:04.580]
The unmentioned one oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm monitoring you

[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.280]
I'm gonna call up all your responses. I'm monitoring you

[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.820]
The fake Scott for Rouse is Neil you're the best Georgia's okay as long as he doesn't do a four-hour show

[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.940]
The email format is okay, but I do like some calls once in a while fact fact is it's your show and who gives a flying

[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.360]
If what some people think that's correct

[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.540]
I do like some calls once in a while. I would too if we ever had any

[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:32.620]
Miss you Neil. I'm drowning over here on Howard 101 any chance you can get me back on the year to shake it up

[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:34.820]
The fake Scott for all no no chance

[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:40.060]
The Dow is up just a shade under 300 points. Wow

[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:46.480]
I think we ought to have a big big big-ass party get a bunch of food in there. Okay, and give them some free plugs today

[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.780]
Any day, okay tell Joe Bell to go to hell

[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:56.280]
Tell him when he delivers that trade-out car for you. That's when you'll start listening to his bullshit

[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:04.180]
Good plan. I think I finally threw out. I headed my pile of crap here that memo

[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:10.460]
About the food in the studio. Oh, yeah, I probably said that was I think the turning point

[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.980]
That was the beginning of the end

[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:20.740]
And then of course after that started this crap about eating on the year all this belonging all of a sudden after all these years

[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:25.220]
They decided oh eating on the air is gross and the lips macking and all that other crap

[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:28.640]
I wish I had a weenia go and he went up right now just just out of spite

[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.920]
Well his deal wasn't eating on the air it was the getting no no that that that has

[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.820]
morphed into that sure

[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:40.020]
The neurosis about us eating on the air I don't know in the middle of the day when people eat lunch

[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.360]
I don't believe a one of those people

[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:47.620]
No, they're all they're all fake. I'm right. Keep trying to tell you about these e-mailers. Oh, Jean-en provocatorum goyum

[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:51.620]
They're all about your fakers that I was definitely 292 now got too close to 300

[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.900]
Oh Walt was suggestion for a poll oh

[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:01.460]
God what's your take on hot and spicy? Oh my god

[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.920]
Huh and then it was so good. He said it twice

[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.780]
It was such a great poll idea Walt sent it twice. Why hadn't he deleted twice

[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:13.500]
Hot and spicy what you take on hot and spicy. I don't know

[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.740]
If that isn't tragic. I have no idea what is but but at least it was a different guy

[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:25.640]
See that that's why when you knock the fake this one and fake that one the chronic email like fakes yeah

[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:27.820]
At least their stuff I can read

[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.820]
The stuff from a lot of these people like Walt with this

[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:36.040]
pathetic poll. I mean what am I gonna do with that besides wife my ass? I don't know

[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:39.420]
Well

[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:43.100]
Well, let's move along. Kathy says subject bubble crap

[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:49.900]
Wester was something listen to other than him don't listen full time but tune back and forth among the other stations

[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000]
Can't wait to see Bubba's numbers next time though

[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.300]
Almost tuned about for good when he added another market to his network and proclaimed he was gonna run Bob and Tom

[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.900]
Those old men who just sit there and cackle out of town

[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:03.440]
He's stirring junior when it comes to that

[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.140]
No one and nothing is as good as him what it comes to his show

[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:15.700]
This morning because of his ADD they went from talking about the 16-year-old who fell from the balcony in Daytona to a radio

[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:20.100]
Stunt he did when he styled the skydive tandem and the school didn't harness him correctly

[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:26.640]
He suffered some kind of damage to his thighs because the straps were in the wrong place and went on and on about how awful

[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.540]
This was and how that if anyone on his staff was ever stupid enough to skydive he'd fire them

[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.700]
Then he went to commercials first one of which was a skydiving school

[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:43.360]
Again Mike Disney can we have our music back now or Bob and Tom please says Kathy please pretty please

[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.100]
Please no

[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:53.600]
Well, there's a few people that think uh Bubba's the greatest things in sliced bread. I'll tell you that

[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.100]
Not too many

[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:56.360]
I

[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:01.200]

Yeah, Bubba lost bunch is the greatest morning show in the history of mankind. That's my opinion. I'm Mike Disney and you're a red nose jerk

[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.040]
Jackass checkball

[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.080]

[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:51.440]
I don't know he was all bent out of shape because his wife had a miscarriage or something and blamed it on me

[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:57.380]
Didn't blame it on me, but was he was just in a sour drunk and moved at noon one day. I see

[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.640]
And so I had a confab with him. I figured what it was about

[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:10.620]
And boy giri had to come running in oh, I want a piece of this too. Uh-huh piece of this. Yeah. You're a piece of something boy giri a piece of shmit

[00:50:53.820 --> 00:51:00.640]
VDL right the other person we have a fake fake Greg VDL we have a fake oh you old faggot if you take calls

[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:07.620]
You'd know I ain't Joe Bell you bitter old faggot's is a Justin Justin who all of a sudden uh-huh

[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:11.660]
Was invented by probably John ZTR or one of the crime sure he just invented him

[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.560]
That's okay good. We that that spices it up a little bit

[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:21.300]
As opposed to I'm your friend. I'm your friend. We can have 40,000 emails saying oh

[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:25.020]
Spice it up with some calls and I'm still not taking any how do you like that?

[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:25.840]
Okay

[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:32.140]
This show has been so much better since I stopped taking the abuse from these four idiots on there and these people

[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:37.920]
Oh, if you just you know and Rick Shaw of all people who's supposed to be a broadcaster who's supposed to understand something about this business

[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.080]
I thought

[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:39.660]
And

[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:47.100]
Instead of just saying hey, I'm doing great retirement is wonderful. Bob Bob Bob Bob bomb still out here listening instead to just say no

[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:53.380]
He's got to give me advice. I don't need your advice. Okay, Rick. There's only one piece of advice

[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:58.240]
You should have given me a long time ago and that's retire and then you could send me a bunch of money so I could afford to

[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:06.400]
I mean one would have thought that you know with all the money I had accumulated over the years that I would be able to retire at this point

[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.580]
But guess what I have an expensive life

[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:13.960]
Got a lot of people out there who depend on those checks coming in every two weeks

[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:22.760]
And you know me yep, you're excited around although I did forget to send those checks dammit to um

[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.140]
Faso and what's his name skinny so

[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.160]
Spatso and so-so

[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:31.920]
Oh, yeah, Cordis he's so so

[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:34.580]
He is

[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:42.820]
Poor Joe. I know he's your buddy because you do drugs with him or whatever, but beside that whatever now because you had the hot for his Russian girlfriend had

[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.400]
And he was willing to share but then she dumped his ass in a heartbeat

[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:52.840]
When she discovered that it was like a stomp a fake penis

[00:52:55.260 --> 00:53:01.480]
Did you know that the judge cordis has a stomp penis? Uh, no, I know it's it not know that little bird told me

[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.980]
Were you drugs back in

[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.340]
Some

[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.200]
He insisted where is that causing now

[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.700]
I'm your friend

[00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:58.840]
Your friend

[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.660]
That's for the people want to calls

[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.700]
Thank you. Okay. You're welcome on their behalf

[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:13.360]
Joe howards is subject phone callers high-neil in George for many years of listening to your show since 91

[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:17.520]
I never called in because I stumble bumble and stutter when I speak on the year

[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:23.260]
I am much more fluent able to get the point across and contribute a lot more effectively to the show when I write

[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:30.580]
Plus the boss never hears my voice when I email and he thinks I'm working anyway, but that's just me

[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:36.600]
Sure, there are those calls where someone can discuss the topic and sound interesting, but that's a small minority of colors

[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:37.600]
Absolutely

[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:45.760]
Of course without phone calls there are no more people saying it is so hard or I don't know or I I I which are staples of the show

[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:49.340]
Good luck to the two you says Joe. Well guess what Joe when's the last time

[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:53.740]
And you can inform me when's the last time that we had a clip

[00:54:54.360 --> 00:55:00.540]
A drop-in from somebody on the phone from a phone call long time years ago

[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:01.720]
Mm-hmm

[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:07.200]
There are no drop-ins from people who just say I'm your friend a hundred times

[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:13.620]
A thousand times a million times a cosidian time. There are no drop-ins. There's nothing there

[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:14.700]
And

[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:20.020]
And maybe somebody in the audience will think of the last time we had somebody

[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:24.240]
Say something cutesy or interesting or amusing or whatever

[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.040]
Like for example

[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:30.540]
Since he mentions this and is a male

[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:36.240]
That's hundred years ago. Mm-hmm. The bridge tender 200 years ago

[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:42.500]
The tree lady 400 years ago all of that stuff your gay

[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.000]
Yeah, that may be the last one

[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.300]
Mm-hmm. That's from your boyfriend. I can't believe you played that actually well

[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:54.160]
Well, what it was all right. It was a funny call

[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.300]
Well, well, well, well, well, well

[00:55:57.940 --> 00:55:59.120]
What do we have up to 86?

[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:03.920]
Can't quite get to that 300 mark if it does boy. I'm going back to bed

[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:11.460]
What the hell W.I.W.D. listeners flood station with good news

[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:20.000]
The fake Tom jikers but this is a whole puff piece about Jimmy syphilis not interested Tom

[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.740]
We're not promoting the Jimmy syphilidic show, okay

[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.960]
George still has no car

[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:32.400]
He also had no car in Cuba and every day he saw his family drive around Cuba on bicycles his life is no different

[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:38.520]
In Miami. Please let him down easy on your capitalist tool in my cheer him up Yankee dog hater Fidel

[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:46.400]
Whatever the hell that all means just another another chief shot at poor George. I bet you that's from Joe Bell

[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:53.880]
That's a rationalization over the fact that they lied you they have no intention of trading with car or they even a bicycle

[00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:01.200]
And you really believe them did I ever say that? I think you did

[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:07.640]
Did I ever say that now got the impression that you did did you not believe them? I didn't I don't believe anything

[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:09.540]
In this place

[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:12.740]
It's Monday. I don't believe it Monday

[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.920]
Monday Tuesday Saturday. Let's do that again

[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:19.600]
Yeah, let's go back to what the what does that mean? We'll get like 20 different

[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:23.740]
Definition right of Monday and then we can discuss the different meanings of the word beach

[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:27.480]
I guess I could just ask Paco directly what does that mean Monday?

[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:30.540]
But then then he would assume I'm trying to like listen in on the phone calls

[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:33.800]
I think it's funny that he got all been on a shape that you wanted to take a Spanish class

[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:38.420]
He didn't get bent out of shape. He just you know was sour on it

[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:40.560]
That I thought it was a bad idea

[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:45.800]
I think it's a great idea a bad idea. No, it's not a great idea. I'm 66 years old

[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:49.260]
I'm gonna start taking Spanish lessons why not I'm gonna learn another language

[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:53.720]
Why not tell you why not because when you get old you don't have your brain doesn't have the

[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:58.160]
Retentive capacity that does when you're younger. You don't have the ability to learn like when you get true

[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:03.800]
It's a cop out. Well, what do you know about it? What do you know about being 66 years old? You should only live so long

[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.820]
I hope I do well good luck to you

[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:14.440]
And when you're 66 how about taking some Russian lessons so you can commute or come come first with a fidel I just might come in Easter come in Easter

[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:21.140]
There's that great scene where Batista is admitting defeat and bailing out

[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:24.560]
Salud salud salud salud my ass

[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:27.600]
Batista what a gangster

[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:32.320]
But they like them because he was their gangster, you know that that's always the way it is

[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:40.140]
It's like the old Jews on the beach they left my Arlansky because he was a their gangster. He used to walk his dog

[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:44.540]
I'm Collins Avenue was such a wonderful man. Yeah, he should live so long

[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:53.940]
All those old parts all those miserable old crabby bastards that used to just bug the crap out of me at WS news and KAT

[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:56.760]
They're all dead now. They're all pushing up daisies. They're all dead

[00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:58.460]
Every one of them

[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:04.180]
Rogers you'll never make it six months in this market bad. Yeah, they're all dead

[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:09.180]
Including there was one old creep

[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:14.940]
Used to call Larry Kent all the time and Larry would put him on here and send it just hanging up on him right away

[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:20.380]
Larry would put him on here. Let him go through his whole thing bashing me the faggla bag by me all this other crap

[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:22.680]
What that was his name and it'll come to me

[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:30.820]
Larry Kent he's also dead by the way big fat dead man. Yeah big and fat general leads to dead right

[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:35.980]
Oh, I got some dead people in my pile here. What the hell did I do with them? Wow you got a pile of dead people I'm really slipping bad

[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.940]
Before we get I finally do have a mcumulating a bunch of crap here today. Thank God

[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:46.780]
Better than revert into the calls. Oh, you're wrong. Neal. You're wrong. Ricky Tiki says you're wrong

[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:48.100]
Well, you know what screw Ricky Tiki

[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.920]
Let him stick to his talk ups into his 50s and 60s music

[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:56.100]
He's an expert on a show

[00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:04.940]
Non-coach your hot dog in science rage at Jewish eatery restaurant owner brandish electric knife to fend off and rage customers

[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:12.620]
It was all an all-out frankfurter frenzy this week at a popular Jewish restaurant in Brooklyn

[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.920]
As a certain hot dog caused a near riot

[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:23.120]
It's not what you'd expect a worker in New York City to record on tape fending off a group of Jewish patrons with an electric knife

[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:25.220]
Oh

[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:31.020]
I was petrified stuff was going through my mind a patron who didn't want his name you said I want to live

[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:34.040]
I don't want to get stabbed for a hot dog. What a weeny

[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:39.700]
Cute the long time patrons is the chaos broke out when he and a rabbi noticed the frankfurters on the grill

[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:43.760]
Were not kosher and a restaurant that's supposed to be dishing out the kosher variety

[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:47.920]
The package didn't look kosher the patron said it was the last piece in the package

[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:52.540]
Some customers were quick to defend the worker was surrounded by according to some witnesses

[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:57.460]
A hundred and rage people he just got angry at the patron said he wasn't about to do anything to the guys

[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:02.660]
The rabbi who originally certified the Shwarma King restaurant kosher

[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:07.620]
I thought Shwarma was a middle eastern like a Arab thing

[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:08.680]
I don't know

[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:15.260]
What is Shwarma? I'll look it up has written a letter to the community in the Jewish newspaper and letter

[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:17.320]
He calls the frankfurter mix up a terrible mistake

[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:26.300]
It was a one-time incident burrow park resident Yosey Stearn who translated the other's letter for CBS two said they cut it before was even served to the consumers

[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:28.920]
Thanks god

[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:31.300]
Can you imagine them eating trough?

[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.720]
The rabbi tells the community that a worker was sent out to buy hot dogs and that he went to the wrong market and bought

[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:39.800]
Non-coacher hot dogs neighbors say the owner is an honest man

[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:46.340]
He's a very religious man one neighbor says he studies every morning and he's not the type of guy to fool people

[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:53.800]
The popular spot on 13th Avenue was shut down for several days as rabbis examined the premises for non-coacher food

[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:58.200]
And throughout equipment that came in contact with the uncertified meat. Oh my god

[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:04.620]
Talk about a bunch of real geckys. They threw out equipment that came in contact with the uncertified meat. That's right

[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:05.960]
Oh

[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:10.900]
Customers and the restaurants owners say they're hoping similar incidents don't come up in the future

[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:18.460]
The restaurants owner says in addition to throwing out equipment utensils were cleaned with flame to purge any pieces of the non-coacher food

[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:22.360]
Thank you Delray Dan for a marvelous story an embarrassing story

[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:29.060]
I have a feeling in my life. I've come in contact with uncertified meat, but I'm not going to burn the hell for it

[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.900]
Maybe I am he might

[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.860]
That's okay. It was well worth it. Believe me

[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:37.480]
Uncertified non-coacher meat

[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:41.800]
This should be a worse problem you get you far missing lunatics you

[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.160]
What do I tell you about the orthodox man? I don't know what did you?

[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:55.940]
I think the last one the last drop in was from the crazy bastard Reverend Jones your gays is Fred Souter and Fred of course is a little bit late

[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:58.080]
You know a little bit late. Thanks Fred

[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.120]
Even that was an eternity ago colors are mostly my listening

[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.900]
So I have nothing whatsoever to add and then he writes Eddie

[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.700]
And he wasn't a caller. He was a voicemail guy

[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.760]
That's Fred Souter. Thanks Fred, but as usual a little bit late

[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:13.820]
Oh Anita Brian says

[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.520]
Whoo now we've really made it that Anita's back

[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:22.300]
Wonder how Bob Greens doing. He's still out hanging out with the guys

[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:29.340]
David says you're gonna take some calls old man and give us what we want we want the calls

[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:33.740]
You will cute no, I'm not he's giving me orders. He's giving me directions

[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:42.220]
Funny drafts Greg views the Greg mute L. writes where's they list

[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:45.680]
Where's they list not where's the list where's they list

[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.780]
You're illiterate besides being a hated by everybody Greg

[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:53.780]
Greg also says and now you're turning on the great Rickshaw because he dares to offer some show advice you are relentless

[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:54.840]
Yes, I am

[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.540]
I like him just fine. I just don't want him tell me how to do my show that's all

[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.840]
I never told him how to do his talk up so how to do his show

[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.400]
I treated him with the greatest respect and like him just fine

[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:08.140]
But don't send me long ponderous emails about how I should do this and let's meet halfway

[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:13.680]
Like where we're in some kind of a negotiation about how I'm gonna do my show

[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.740]
This is what happens when you retired and you have way too much time on your hands Ricky

[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:23.720]
Oh Shawarma somebody send me a picture you sent it me. Oh looks like crap. What is that?

[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.600]
Looks like a hero it says it's similar to

[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.680]
But what is that turd looks like a goal for sitting on the edge of it?

[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:35.100]
Shawarma

[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:46.260]
Is a middle eastern Arabic style sandwich like rat usually composed of shaved land goat chicken turkey beef or mixture of meat sounds really traith to me

[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:49.160]
Oh yummy. Does it?

[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:49.840]
Mm-hmm

[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.800]
I'll tell you something even better and that's quiznos

[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.320]
Yeah, you're right

[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:17.720]
Now the NASCAR season's back. I want to go to the race track

[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.820]
Where my Chevy T-shirt and looking cat

[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:25.800]
I'm gonna drink me lots of beer

[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:31.380]
I'm gonna open the hyalurant here watch my driver win and take his victory last

[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:37.780]
Then he's gonna smoke his tires

[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:46.860]
The rubber smell can make you cough the baby really gets me off can't be much

[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:47.320]
I

[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:52.740]
Think I'm tough, but it turns me into a cry

[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:55.840]
When the driver smokes his tires

[01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:00.520]
Yeah, smoke this are you smoking tires or what all the time?

[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:06.720]
How about the smell of berth rubber what does that do for you? Uh makes me want to run leave the room really?

[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.740]
Yeah, it's nasty smell you like that. No, I don't

[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.280]
Lots of aromas that I'm not too crazy about especially old shiny money

[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.400]
Ha, what are they going?

[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:18.580]
Old shiny mind

[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:24.240]
Well, guess where I'm going into a clock I just got the emmo

[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:28.020]
That somebody's gonna be pretty bezy today. We're gonna have lunch tomorrow

[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:35.280]
So today I'm free to get my beautiful Corvette and drive right on off to a wood buy em. Two o'clock. I will good

[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:41.360]
Paul Smith says stop using my good name in your angrily old way. Stop now joe bill

[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:49.900]
Okay, these people are just having some fun. Okay, and you take it also. Oh, it's the same chronic

[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:56.420]
Zababa. Who cares? All that's important is that you like you said get paid get laid. I'm getting paid

[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.200]
Let's get start

[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:04.000]
Not the other part here's one it says. Oh, it's an eater did already

[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.840]
Oh, you know if I don't get to it right away in two seconds

[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.500]
You don't have to send it the second time like the fake time jica about Paul Lyle

[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:17.540]
Could you add too many news channels to the pool? No, that's stupid too many news channels too many sports channels too many

[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:22.720]
You know, that's just stupid isn't it? Yes, and one thing we don't want to be like Mo would say stupid

[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:28.380]
Anita Bryant says I enjoy listening to your show a couple suggestions for you to mull over

[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.320]
STFU about what is that?

[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:36.920]
About glory holes and all the gay stuff. What is STF you mean shut the f up? Oh?

[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:41.220]
Really yes, hey, I learned something. It's not even noon yet. I learned something today stick around

[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:46.620]
We got more it's disgusting the only person gets off hearing that is George because apparently he's having some issues with his wife

[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:47.200]
Uh-huh

[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:48.480]
well

[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.480]
He's having some issues with his wife now. We know

[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.640]
What you're doing in your spare time?

[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.300]
glory hole. Yeah

[01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:00.180]
He's hanging out at Westland. Oh, yeah, what's that other mall?

[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.740]
It's a dog. He's a great. The dolphin mall the dolphin mall

[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:08.300]
It says I do like the emails as people can express themselves better than on the phone

[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:15.220]
I did like the phone calls the best phone call was meant some guy called in city was driving around on the highway and they go back to talk about something unrelated

[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:22.800]
During his conversation he starts screaming and played the sound audio of a car crash

[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:26.880]
I think he or

[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:28.700]
Or she

[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.340]
Did this a few times on the show do you remember that no

[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:35.700]
Playing a car crash sounds in the background

[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:42.000]
Wow talk more about movies. I

[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.020]
Trust you as a recommender of movies. I took your advice to see once upon a time in America a couple of years back

[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.360]
Please suggest more movies

[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:50.420]
Well, what about American

[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.500]
History X uh-huh

[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:59.340]
So all in all less clear stuff more movie talk dedicate plus or minus 30 minutes of your show to take calls

[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:05.300]
And let all the prank call us get out of their system. No the purpose of the show isn't for them to get it out of their system

[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:11.420]
That's not the purpose of the show and send George back to Cuba so we can't be bothered to do the show and continue to be

[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.740]
Wining about his wife or whipped by his wife

[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:20.840]
You can replace him with a real assistant like Brian Craig says they need a Brian. Well, there's a match made in heaven right

[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:25.180]
I need a Brian and Brian Craig. Oh my god. Talk about a gay obsession

[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:30.520]
Now guess what I know it's gonna come as a great shock two things one

[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.200]
We don't show up here every day to take abuse from people and number two

[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:38.280]
I'll talk about whatever the hell I want to talk about and I'll do the show however the hell I want to do the show

[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:42.720]
Oh, no, that's wrong. Neil. You have to you have to satisfy your customers

[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.720]
The thousand two seventy seven seventy seven. No, it's remember what I told you

[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:54.200]
So many times in life that just keeps popping up that seventy seven not forty four

[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.080]
Not sixty six not twenty two

[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.200]
but seventy seven

[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:02.140]
brings us back to the old days of radio baby

[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:09.940]
That he's still alive right chubby checker far as we know. Yeah, we know he's alive

[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.020]
Brandon says I can't understand why somebody like Bubba can be on the year

[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:19.480]
Not only is he unlistenable. He can't talk worth a damn. He stutters really bad to to to to to to to to 25

[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:26.900]
And he always talks about him and his staff are manly men because they go to strip clubs and drink beer and anybody who doesn't do these things are

[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:29.420]
And other manly things is a fag

[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:30.500]
Everybody

[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:39.220]
Everybody who isn't on their side is either a fag betcha or a hack bad radio shows his Brandon Bubba to love sponge. Oh

[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:48.840]
What a big impact yet almost as big as a man cow remember that experiment that was Steve left again and James crystal radio

[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.660]
Norma can't suspect specialty

[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.780]
By the way ask me if I've heard from Norma can't know

[01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:00.560]
I don't care if I hear from Norma can't ever again because he's just you know he he's obsessed with this fantasy baseball and his fantasy

[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.240]
Legal blog and fantasy life and whatever fantasy lunches with Joe Bell

[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.900]
When or somebody who doesn't follow through with their ass assignment

[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:15.480]
I don't I don't reckon that I'm gonna sit down or write a check and mail it out to anybody. No, they don't follow through their ass. I know

[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.560]
The fake Tom jikus is Bubba loves bunch versus octomom

[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:30.440]
I freely admit to being a pencil neck geek says fake Tommy whose brain is added by too much of the Diane rem show. Who's that?

[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:40.140]
Diane Reams maybe Ream who is that on NPR? I believe she reams. I think so still. I'm really shocked yet as I was flipping through radio stations this morning

[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:45.600]
I was taken aback by the on air pumbling that 93.1 Bubba loves bunch was giving to the octomom

[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:50.280]
Bubba was talking about how people like octomom just drain resources from taxpayers

[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:54.900]
How good people like himself should be allowed to have kids he said in the span of just a few minutes

[01:11:54.900 --> 01:12:00.600]
Bubba called the octomomah or at least five times and a bitch at least eight times killed a mom killed a doctor. He said

[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:01.560]
yeah

[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:07.300]
Judging by the FCC guidelines Bubba was pushing his luck on the agency's website

[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:14.000]
It defines profanity as including language so grossly offensive to members of the public who actually hear that is to amount to a nuisance

[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.340]
Oh in other words you couldn't turn it off

[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.140]
Profane speech is prohibited on broadcast radio and television between the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m

[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:28.800]
David Frisk the director of the FCC's office of media relations says his office very well if you don't like it complain to the FCC fake Tommy

[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:30.700]
Go ahead

[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:38.160]
Go at least Bubba exercise some restraint when he said of the octomom. I so want a blast to see word on her right now, but he didn't

[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:43.680]
Then he went back to his contest to see if any of his minions could drink a yellow green milk without puking

[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:44.340]
Oh

[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:47.540]
so Tampa

[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:49.900]
Temple terrorists

[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.040]
Loots

[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:57.920]
Dunnian Clearwater. What? Dunninen. Dunninen. Dunninen. You don't eat me. I'm Dunninen. All right. I haven't thought I'd think about anything

[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:03.580]
The refrigerator that could eat on here just to piss off those it is oh it's so bad man to do as you will do as you please

[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.020]
But yeah, but my ass

[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.880]
Assure but all these don't you got the ladies on this phony complainers

[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:20.620]
Oh Adam Oshmok over in Kitchener Waterloo sends me a story here about a kid in China who got killed by a chair.

[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.320]
Sounds like one of those horror movies.

[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.380]
Like an animated chair?

[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:29.160]
No.

[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:33.440]
Oh Frank Delvecchio who keeps sending me copies of these letters.

[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:36.200]
Oh my god Frank, good luck to you. Your intentions are great.

[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.220]
Good bug on me.

[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:44.620]
Now they're starting to come in man. Now they're starting to trickle in including one from the real suds.

[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:47.500]
I bet it's the real one because he occasionally does email me.

[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:48.220]
Yes he does.

[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:49.820]
Well let's see what he says.

[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:57.700]
A guy goes in for a checkup, is sitting on the table wearing his paper gown when the doctor comes in and says,

[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:01.200]
first you have to stop masturbating. Why ask the patient?

[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.980]
The doctor says because I need to examine you.

[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.860]
That's not bad. It's cute.

[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:08.600]
Old but cute.

[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:09.820]
And so old?

[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:10.380]
Oh yeah.

[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:12.420]
Well I never heard it before and you're always.

[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:14.220]
They don't come any older than me.

[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:15.440]
Thanks son.

[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:17.680]
Howard David's a bitch.

[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.660]
Oh what the hell?

[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:19.600]
They got a call here.

[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:22.140]
The number one rating they've been in a moholic in David and his show.

[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:24.380]
At least according to my aspirations.

[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:26.080]
They're your way from me.

[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.600]
I don't even know how you have children.

[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:28.760]
Mirabah hello.

[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:31.580]
I want to take on J. Feeble.

[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:36.020]
Oh well J. Feeble is a great quarterback and a good joke.

[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.700]
I like J. Feeble.

[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:43.040]
Well not to mention he's got extraordinary, never-least smooth but pops.

[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:44.060]
Oh yeah.

[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:45.860]
David's got to be careful what you say here.

[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.480]
Oh kiddop. Thank you mom.

[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.560]
Oh no no wait a minute.

[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:48.960]
It's all go.

[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:51.380]
But I have nothing else to say.

[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:52.520]
Look at how about this.

[01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:54.440]
How's the weather down there in Mirabah?

[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.280]
I'm right down the street from you.

[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:57.920]
I have to go.

[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:58.860]
Oh I know. Wait by the way.

[01:14:59.060 --> 01:14:59.260]
No.

[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:01.440]
No I have to go.

[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:02.320]
Look I tell you what.

[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:03.700]
I'll hold you open up break.

[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:04.140]
How's that?

[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.800]
I'll give you one of my old tank t-shirts.

[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:07.320]
How's that?

[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:09.000]
It's all right.

[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:11.260]
That's what the only color we had.

[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.900]
The things on your nose is growing again.

[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:14.620]
It's all right.

[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:15.180]
It's all right.

[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.160]
It's all right.

[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:20.140]
It's all right.

[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:20.900]
It's all right.

[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:21.360]
It's all right.

[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:22.800]
It's all right.

[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:22.940]
It's all right.

[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:23.640]
It's all right.

[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:24.020]
It's all right.

[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:24.460]
Wow.

[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.000]
You got things.

[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:27.760]
We both think.

[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:31.840]
On your nose and on your face.

[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.760]
And around those posing pimples.

[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.680]
You call my eye.

[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:43.040]
If you go look in the mirror, you'll see.

[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:46.880]
A road map of Yipsiland Sea.

[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.120]
You got your happy sun.

[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.100]
Way to die.

[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:54.500]
I know it's close.

[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:56.540]
When something stays.

[01:15:56.540 --> 01:16:00.160]
Almost every day I think.

[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:03.660]
And my veins are so thin they start to tickle.

[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.360]
My eye denies the door to door is yours.

[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:11.540]

And say it's kind of extraordinary.

[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:33.760]

[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.440]

[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:47.280]
Why would you say thank you very much for your call? Here's something that if this is true

You will have the biggest party in your pants in a history of the human race. Well, let me give my pants ready

High Neal and George Zilla bastard none of the panthers was why we don't care about that

[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:16.100]
I was wondering if you've gotten reports on who's gonna replace Sid in the morning yet

[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:18.000]
Well, if you have it I have news for you

[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:21.580]
Sadano doesn't want to leave his time slot even though you've beat him consistently

[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:25.760]
He's cleaning your couple of books or trends where he won on the ratings non-existent

[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:31.700]
Maybe there was a trend a month or so in there somewhere where they got some diaries wired

[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:37.460]
I think he knows that he's benefiting from low expectations when he's going against you from 12 to 2 p.m

[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:42.840]
If he were to move the mornings the expectations would be much higher and his job would be in serious jeopardy

[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:49.560]
If he didn't start getting higher ratings something above the ones the powers that be have finally begun to consider other options

[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:54.300]
In case they don't make Sadano move the mornings the rumor at the office is here you go

[01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:56.500]
Hold on tight, okay

[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:02.580]
You're strapped in I am I got it all out to know it loaded. Let me give you a clue

[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:13.260]
How about that

[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:20.960]
The rumor at the office is Jason Jackson coming at you. He's been a fill in for a few mornings and next week or two

[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:25.460]
Oh my god from your mouth through the Lord's ass right

[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:29.420]
That is the greatest news in the history of the subhuman race

[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:30.380]
Wow

[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:38.120]
That makes sense he failed badly over here both stations if it sucks if it has failed if it failed in this market if it failed in another

[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:43.140]
Market let's put it out twice. They love it. Let's put it on again. Let it fail. Let's see how that

[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:48.860]
Failer's yeah, if it first you don't succeed fail again. Sure. Isn't that how that saying goes?

[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:53.040]
Oh, apparently there's a lot of ones that subscribe to that philosophy now

[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:58.340]
Here's something I just learned because I looked up deep purple which is a great song not yeah, not by Mohawar

[01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:02.060]
Oh, I do love that bit where he says add no do do do do do do do do do do do do do is

[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:06.720]
Wow, that's almost as good as good as good hope with the goober and gubernatorial

[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:09.020]
Or whatever he says mm-hmm

[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:13.360]
Nino tempo in April see you Stevens had a very big hit deep purple

[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.640]
There we go

[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.400]
How do you do that so fast?

[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.760]
I got Russian fingers

[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:25.320]
You got what Russian fingers man Russian fingers

[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.600]
What do they call those

[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:35.600]
Um like tiramisu is made with a certain kind of thing

[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:39.340]
Copy no, I'm not talking about that certain kind of like

[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:45.400]
Like a pastry thing. Oh, I don't know somebody of them. Oh

[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:51.420]
What do they call those you know what I'm talking about they're like orange and filled with cream

[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:57.660]
Ooh sounds good whatever you're talking they are good. What do they call it? Well somebody will know so anyway

[01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:04.080]
Nino tempo napole Stevens which I never knew this before and I bet you don't know it either brother and sister rack from New York

[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:07.760]
No, I did not know that speaking of brother and sister acts. Yeah

[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:11.500]
Same song brother sister I mean Marie

[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.480]
Hey, Donnie how the hang

[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:18.300]

[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:25.020]
What do you got Donnie see who I couldn't hear a worse version?

[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:30.180]
Yeah bad really bad didn't need to be done like a lot of those remade movies didn't need to be done

[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:33.180]
That was up to 92

[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:38.440]
Oh look at this people are going to financial boot camp on CNN

[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:43.220]
Maybe they can bring back Sally Jesse and resurrect your crap. Are you thinking about lady fingers?

[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:47.300]
Lady fingers. That's right. I think that's what they call them. Is that thanks Lee?

[01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:52.740]
Oh, thanks Lee see Lee knows his fingers. Yes, he does and he knows his

[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:54.740]
Yes, that's right from your elbow

[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:01.680]
Formed in the early 1960s when you know tempo napole Stephen signed as a duo with ad co records

[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:07.300]
The group had a string of billboard heads earned a Grammy award is the best rock and roll record of the year for the single deep playful

[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:12.820]
Now who did the ability award the dominoes did the purple I bet you don't have that

[01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:18.560]
Uh, no, the dominoes. Well, why not they had a great recording on Liberty Records if it's out there. I'll get it

[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:19.480]
Same song

[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:24.180]
Deep what I just say deep purple well, I mean that might be a different song by the same thing

[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:29.740]
There's not another song named deep purple my god. What is wrong with you now? Who did the original deep purple back in 1940 something

[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:34.920]
Deep purple by hoggy Carmichael is that who it was?

[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:41.060]
Or did he just start us? I always think of those two songs in the same vein for some reason

[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:46.000]
That was up 300 points. Oh now it's back to 290. Uh six

[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:53.420]
I was up 300 points just as I looked at the screen and then it the receded it went back down real fast somebody sold something

[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:59.360]
Probably Maria nice hair and for me today Maria by the way this Friday we're starting that feature not

[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:05.800]
Did I was up 300 point 27 oh oh happy day 301

[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.340]
Now here's something also you didn't know

[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:12.200]
Nor did I

[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:18.620]
Deep purple was originally released as a B side by producer Ahmed Erdogan who was a who was dubious of tempo's belief

[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:25.480]
That would be a hit calling it the most embarrassing thing the two of them had ever recorded really when the A side of the record paradise flopped

[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:31.900]
Erdogan related in the song achieved notability as the longest running hit B side a title occurred for 21 years

[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:36.280]
I'm trying to think what was the other side of the Beatles ticket to ride

[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:37.860]
Yes, it is

[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.640]
Oh wait for chicken neck

[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.760]
Yes, it is yes, it is a great song you never heard though

[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.340]
That's very good. It is great. Yes, it is yes

[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:52.640]
Music journalist Richie Unterberger has described the later song all strung out as Nino tempo Napoli

[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:58.700]
Stephen's greatest triumph never heard of it declaring it one of the greatest Phil Spector inspired productions of all time all strung out

[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:03.880]
You got it? No looking for years following their charting singles the duo continued recording

[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:09.960]
But failed to achieve continued sales success in other words they became a big fat flop

[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:14.780]
Just like Josh treatment they became a big fat flop

[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:18.920]
Oh, what are setting news about the Morning Show across the street if true

[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.600]
Come on that child. Oh

[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:25.880]
You think that did had a bad number which he did this number will definitely start with a oh

[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:30.120]
And then the second number might be oh wow. It's a mad world

[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:33.000]
It's a mad sports world baby

[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:42.840]
I am Osama Deneden and whenever I am in Miami I listen to Nero Rogers for a tune out

New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans cause it's very sheep

[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:42.440]
Step up and shake the hand of someone you can't stand you can tolerate him if you try

[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:52.280]
All the Protestants hate the Catholics and the Catholics hate the Protestants and the Hindus hate the Muslims

[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.320]
Everybody hates the Jews

[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.400]
National brother to eat

[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.060]

Now wait till you're this wait before that

[01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:28.720]
What who was that original deep purple by that you were talking about

[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:30.300]
Hogan Carmichael

[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:36.720]
Okay, I'm still looking I think I think I could be wrong. No, and it was also that one by Billy Warden the dominoes

[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:40.880]
All right, that was great. I'm looking for every year. Well, saying the purple. I think

[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.980]
The platters are the racing start-ost

[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.920]
Hang on. Let me fire something off here

[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.300]
Fire it you're fired

[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:52.660]
Give it a yeah, give it a second

[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:55.860]
Oh my god

[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:59.740]
How much 40s craft to me. I don't know what it is

[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:03.160]
But it's what does that mean the name of it is deeper

[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:10.000]
That's it for really who is it party Sean Helen for us already

[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.040]
My god next to be playing already line

[01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:15.060]
Wow

[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:20.120]
I don't have a date on this but oh they don't make them like that anymore. Thank god

[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:26.820]
Okay, now I want to ask you a question sure. I've always wondered this on my life

[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:28.600]
But it's almost too embarrassing to ask anybody

[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:34.500]
But I guess if you watch those movies from like the 30s and 40s mm-hmm

[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:37.640]
And you'll notice that the way people spoke

[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.780]
Women in particular

[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:43.700]
Was very affected you know, I mean by that yes

[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:49.740]
Is that how people really spoke that's is great. That's a very good question because that you know

[01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:53.240]
Could have been just something they were doing for the movie obviously. Yeah, so I don't know

[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:58.680]
I'll have to ask some old guy that was alive in those days. Oh much older than me and if so

[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:05.900]
Like in Dracula Mina or Mina yeah, I'm pretty sure it was a dramatic melodrama. No

[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:11.000]
I don't think that's where they spoke nothing like me neither did they really wear those hats then to have a date with me

[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.940]
What kind of names of those me da and me na and I don't know

[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:21.140]
Foreign one of the parking spots I rented in this building was from a British lady. Her name was Mita

[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:23.340]
And she was looking at the parking meter

[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:25.280]
Yeah, that must have been it

[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:32.420]
And she's gone once she's gone. She's longer. I meant I had to go and rent another one from somebody else pain in the ass

[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.380]
Here's a guy that just oh

[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.540]
Although it does say ps great show last Thursday. I have two words for Rickshaw go to hell

[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.140]
That's three words

[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:45.920]
Jorge Hernandez

[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.680]
He says I heard you talk about watching the godfather movies this weekend

[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:57.780]
I'm probably one of the few people who has not seen godfather one and two. Yeah, you're the one why

[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:04.120]
I saw godfather three at a theater and hated it. Yeah, I'm afraid to waste another six hours of my life on the first two movies

[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:08.480]
I think you and I might have completely opposite taste in movies now wait when you hear this all right

[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.520]
You might slide a little bit off the edge of the chair. All right. Let me put my seat belt up

[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.160]
I

[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:20.800]
Think you and I might have completely opposite taste in movies are rented fatso and network based on your recommendations. It hated both of them

[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:23.060]
Cornish dolphin

[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:27.440]
How can you hate fatso or network and both?

[01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:33.160]
I was going to suggest really frost my ass in fact

[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:39.980]
I was going to suggest that this person don't let number three, you know

[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:43.400]
Ruined the other two for you. No, if he hated network and fatso

[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:47.240]
He probably wouldn't like godfather one too, but yes his taste is in his toss

[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:53.980]
He says I just heard the stadium deal is done only three votes against the site too bad that tourist tax could have been used for

[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:55.000]
Edge humocation

[01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:02.100]
Last night I went to eat at sweet tomatoes and pember pines and my kids saw two old ladies possibly from these century village brigade

[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:06.480]
Stuffing many muffins into their purses which had glad ziplock bags unreal

[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.780]
My kids felt sorry for them and said maybe they were poor

[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:13.140]
I told them they weren't taking the muffins because they're poor

[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:16.600]
They stole those muffins because they figure the world always them those muffins

[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.080]
At a boy or hey, you're right

[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:21.200]
First they start with a sweet and low they put all those people out of business

[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:25.420]
Pumper nicks and wolfies and all those other people they put them out of business and now they're working on everybody else

[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:29.220]
All you old this is a new generation of sweet and low Steelers

[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:33.540]
How do you like that? Mm-hmm see what I've told you years ago

[01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:36.260]
I've remember saying it many many times and I've kept to my word

[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:42.080]
That's when I was in my 30s and 40s and I said no matter how old I live to be

[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:49.060]
I'm never going to be like those people and here I am a senior citizen officially 66 and no way do I go to early bird dinners

[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:54.600]
Do I steal a stuff off the table and restaurants no way not yet no chance

[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:57.920]
No chance in my pants

[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:02.700]
Your friend PR Ralph says lady fingers. Oh several people. Thank you. So lady fingers

[01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:09.440]
Now is not what they use in making um tiramisu. I'm not sure. Yeah, okay. Ask our pony cheese

[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:13.660]
Lady fingers and whatever else they stick in her. Oh, man. It's good stuff. Mm-hmm

[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:19.140]
And PR Ralph says tell Ricky Tickey that a man in your position can afford to look ridiculous

[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:25.300]
Yeah, hey Ricky Tickey a man in my position can afford to look ridiculous

[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:32.420]
That's what what's his name said check waltz waltz

[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:40.240]
This is the business we have chosen I didn't ask

[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:47.460]
That man was mo green there's not even a plaque in that city with his name on it

[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:51.160]
He had an eye for the news though mo

[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:52.880]
momentarily

[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:59.660]
And I think it was just a coin a coin kidding that he put his glasses on to see who was coming in the door when he was getting massaged

[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:02.700]
I think they who wasn't that shot him

[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:11.260]
Which is what will he teachy? Yeah, that's right. I think it was awfully kind of willy to wait for motor put his glasses on so that he could see what was about

[01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:13.640]
So we can see the bullet coming hey chance mo

[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:18.200]
It's a look at the chance to turn away like push with the shoe you know in Iraq check this out

[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:24.920]
Too dead people working you believe it's

[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:30.440]
I'm all you to the dead people now must have had a powerful show the first two hours. That's right. Just flew by

[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.700]
Now up 307

[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:42.120]
There's Suzanne Malvo Suzanne she that's one thing about bush. He actually said that there used to be Susan now you Suzanne or used to yes Suzanne Malvo

[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:45.960]
Talk about affected talk about fake

[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:52.640]
Scott and panelists parks as Jackie Gleason did a good instrumental of deep purple as well

[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:56.680]
Jackie Gleason didn't instrumental what did he play it on I don't know

[01:32:58.780 --> 01:33:01.380]
He played the fat keys on the piano I have no idea

[01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:07.580]
See you don't have no hokey Carmichael no one nobody knows about that because we don't have anybody that old

[01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:10.540]
I'll keep looking. Well, we probably do but they don't have no computer

[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:13.940]
Book of Brian says it goes all the way back to the Glenn Miller days

[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:16.320]
Yeah, the forties like I said

[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:23.160]
Well, what about that when you play there by Arty Lang and the Howard Sternest forties if it was a minute. Yeah

[01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:30.760]
You could tell by the the opening bridge there you did try to ask that idea. That's right. Wow

[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:36.480]
That's right. That's exactly correct. How come they don't do that no more because it sounds awful. Oh

[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:42.520]
Now that they have all this techno pop crap and all this I mean some of it was pretty good for a while there

[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:45.300]
How about that Brittany

[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:52.480]
How about I'm telling one thing she's got that hot guy in that video. I'll say this portion of the show brought to you by

[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:56.240]
Britney Spears but JJ. Oh, it's hanging out y'all

[01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:58.740]
Oh

[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:03.900]
Well, I'm sure sad that I missed that concert. Paco said it was great sensational

[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:09.480]
They had seats right up right close by the stage like I think in the front row

[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:13.620]
Don't even ask how much they cost and I was up 314 points

[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:20.640]
People are starving to death and there are people spending fortunes on tickets to see some

[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:26.260]
Yeah, you marginally talented bitch what you want you are spending fortunes. Yeah, that's true

[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:31.560]
Well, that's okay. I mean, I make money. I got to spend it. I'm helping you know the economies of tourists man

[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:34.180]
People like me are still spreading around that cash

[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:40.860]
I think as far as my vacation time I'm starting this week's now

[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.080]
right

[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.520]
No, actually, it's been pretty good. We got off to a slow start there

[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:50.720]
But once thanks to Ricky Tiki for rekindling all that debate about those stupid phone calls

[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:53.240]
I think he was just looking to give me some material. There you go

[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:55.780]
I checked that was a big thing. He never re he never responded

[01:34:55.780 --> 01:35:00.500]
He's one of those guys who gets on he gets on the my space thing once about every three four months probably

[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:02.020]
Like most people

[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:07.360]
All the most of my my space people they don't get on at all anymore. That's okay

[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:13.820]
Oh, here's an attachment the forwarded message follows and it's an attachment

[01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:18.080]
And guess what I just did to it deleted did it yes, huh?

[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:24.760]
What part of that don't they understand? I don't open attachments. I don't click on links

[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:28.180]
I don't have the time to pochki around don't you get it?

[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:29.800]
That was up 32

[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:32.600]
order to make sure that

[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:35.960]
Families can get basic consumer loans

[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.200]
Auto loans you notice how they're trying desperately to make him a failure before he basically gets started

[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:42.280]
Immediately

[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:46.560]
Just like they did with Bubba. This is what the right wingers do man

[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:54.660]
From the minute they get in there in fact even before he got inaugurated. Oh, well he he's responsible for the failure and Tim Geithner did this and

[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:57.860]
Chris Dodd did that and Bubba I still don't understand it

[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:01.280]
Now they had a piece on date line last night. Do you see any of it?

[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:04.040]
No about the

[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:12.020]
About the housing bubble and about all these slippers that were getting these loans for that they knew

[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:16.440]
You just look at some of these people. There's no way they can make those mortgage payments. Right just look at him

[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:17.220]
Shleppers

[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:20.280]
So

[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:22.060]
709 votes on the pool. That's not bad

[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:28.660]
That is not bad. I think once they blew out Sid the kid across the street. That was a bad mistake as bad as he was

[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.260]
If they're gonna put on come and at you if they're gonna really do that

[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:37.980]
And I guess what they're doing is they're replacing him by committee. I don't you hate when they do stuff like that

[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:42.360]
I don't understand when they like audition people on the air and they try this one for a couple

[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:46.060]
They always that is such an admission. What are you what are you expecting real

[01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:46.840]
Management

[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:48.820]
In this town

[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:54.980]
God this business is in the toilet, but in this market. It's got its own special

[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:56.200]
phone

[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:01.100]
So tanks a lot. That's what they do across street. They tank a lot

[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:06.800]
What is the worst thing about television that that's a crappy pool? I want to change it if I got another one on air to change

[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.480]
Let me send one air to change it. You think Eric is there. Yeah

[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:14.760]
I doubt it. Oh Willie Chi Chi did not shoot mo green

[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:18.700]
Chi Chi shot the guy to revolving door in New York. Oh, yeah, the junior. Oh

[01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:22.840]
What oh, Kunio when that kuna who was who shot

[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:26.400]
Mo that doesn't sound right

[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:31.620]
Who shot that to bring it up? I thought it was Chi Chi

[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:33.180]
Who shot mo green?

[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:37.600]
That's the question. I bet you branded knows if anybody does maybe he's not to lunch

[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:43.060]
Anyway, let me let me pick a poll to replace this when I hate this poll

[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:51.040]
Ray says the main reason I stay with my husband is my wife or husband. Oh, that's a good one

[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:53.160]
The main reason I stay with my wife or husband is blank

[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.440]
I'm sure you'll find a choice on there

[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.420]
Excellent. Okay, Eric's got it

[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:08.900]
The worst thing about television today reality shows winning hands down

[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:14.380]
350 360 three votes over 51% of the vote reality shows my ass

[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:17.940]
Can you believe it

[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:24.480]
I'll tell you about all the reality shows you know what they share in common. There is no reality on any of them right?

[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:25.420]
Al niri

[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:32.080]
Neerie shot the in the novel. I'm verifying if they did it the same way in the movie

[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:36.880]
Well, of course they would why would they change that because they do things like that all the time not in the movie not in the godfather

[01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:40.280]
I know that the zord even loves neo-rodgers

[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:44.900]
Hey

[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:48.140]

[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:49.340]
on the chair he was sitting in exploded huh the accused chair I wonder if they're going to put the

[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:54.240]
chair on trial the accused here was one of those fancy types with a gas cylinder that's used to

[01:41:54.240 --> 01:42:00.400]
adjust the height of the chair up and down right like this one really does that have a gas cylinder

[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:04.740]

[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:36.560]
boys yes oh the death was marked down as excessive bleeding from his wounds a similar

to get a new chair this chair chair is like seven years old and I had to go and buy this and put

[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:28.940]

the spigot was running what do you call me you think freeway was there if the spigot was running maybe

[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:37.140]
the saline took off on the freeway George Weber was the lifelong fan of radio Jones said in

[01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:41.740]
the statement he was a consummate journalist successful radio career in New York at WABC Los Angeles

[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:50.940]
at where KTLK and KMPC San Francisco KGO radio which is a great station by the way and the Denver KOA

[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:57.040]
while in New York George was part of the highly successful Curtis and Kubi WABC Morning Show where

[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:03.040]
he remained until early 2008 it was then that he joined ABC News Radio as a freelance anchor his

[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:09.940]
last newscast was last Sunday March 15th and now he's dead Weber's blog was updated Friday morning

[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:17.420]
with a post detailing his past bouts with bedbugs and praising Mayor Bloomberg for creating a bedbugs

[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:23.560]
advisory council bedbugs now what's the difference between bedbugs and dust mites I'm not sure

[01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:30.360]
but why not I got dust mites I don't know and man they make you itch and you you can't see them

[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:37.460]
and then you like boy you're a bedding you know you change the bedding and you're like you're washing or real hot

[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:43.340]
wash boiling water and then they come back you know they come back for more dust mites I think

[01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:48.460]
they multiply faster than Chinese and maybe even faster than Muslims boy you talk about people to

[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:55.340]
multiply and and probably one of the reasons they put those burgers those things over the women's

[01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:59.560]
faces because so probably a lot of them are so ugly that they wouldn't be able to keep up the

[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:05.000]
reproduction rate if they could see the face but when the woman's face is I think they go to bed

[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:11.380]
with a covering over their puts you know I wouldn't know oh but I never never done no Muslim chicks huh

[01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:16.940]

God here's one that says I don't believe in God but I believe in ghosts to you oh yeah

[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:04.480]
and if I could read you the name that this person made up I can't do it

[01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:13.620]
it's funny but I can't read it here's one that says I watch the ruins on HBO the other day

[01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:18.540]
it was a little too gory for my taste it's gory I also found a little confusing about who was the

[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:22.900]
jury who was German who was Greek not that it made much difference I guess it was the ridiculously

[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:29.100]
fake accents that's true me I also caught the movie the skeleton key on USA Network you see that

[01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:33.700]
never heard of it no I thought it was pretty scary it was more of a suspense mystery horror movie

[01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:39.860]
with a surprise ending but the most disturbing movie I've seen years was the story of Ed Gahn on

[01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:51.000]
the ifc channel oh Ed Gahn yeah now which mass murder was he um he was the lotion in the basket

[01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:57.560]
yeah he he would skin his victims make skin suits things like this was a fact-based movie about

[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:03.100]
the infamous serial killer Ed Gahn he was the inspiration for Buffalo Bill Norman Bates and the

[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:08.460]
Texas chainsaw massacre they stuck to the actual facts of the story oh this is Cliff and Kendall

[01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:12.840]
in addition they were able to portray what Ed Gahn was thinking at the time based on the 30 years of

[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:17.740]
psychological evaluations he had been given while locked up in the loony bin I don't scare easily but

[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:22.480]
I had nightmares for three days after watching that movie very significant I think it was a

[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:27.820]
Ed Gahn is the name of the movie the story of Ed Gahn we're talking about the same movie yeah uh yeah

[01:57:27.820 --> 01:57:33.920]

Mo Green gets shot in the eye again good luck with that I googled it every which way I ask the

[02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:23.140]
question every way I could think of and and nothing a lot of references to it but nobody you know

[02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:29.100]
it's it's it's supposed to symbolize yeah yeah it's not a lot of conversation a lot of discussion a

[02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:37.040]
lot of forums it seems to be very significant this is on some chat thing I don't think Mo Green

[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:41.340]
getting shot in the eye symbolizes anything I think it was just a gruesome way of killing him

[02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:46.580]
the shot through the eyes based on the killing of a real life mobster in the mid 40s bugs

[02:05:46.580 --> 02:05:50.780]
he's seagull when he got killed he was shot no he was not shot through the eye was shot in a head

[02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:56.580]
who is not shot to the uh the wikipedia has a whole thing on that he was shot several times

[02:05:56.580 --> 02:06:01.200]
in the head in the back of the head one of the shots went out through his eye oh went out

[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:07.060]
to the front of the eye yeah wow I wonder which hurts more going out come out I don't know the

[02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:12.700]
picture the distinction is subtle bugs he's seagull of course he was you know hymen Roth was uh

[02:06:12.700 --> 02:06:19.540]

[02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:13.860]
Alexander is back he starts this one how are you doing Neil so in other words maybe this is what

[02:07:13.860 --> 02:07:19.080]
I was supposed to read before that I didn't read and I just got it you think it's possible

[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:25.800]
and he sends it twice just to make sure well after the break we're going to read it twice

[02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:27.960]
maybe we'll read it all the way to one o'clock

[02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:31.500]
it's the one to do our

[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:34.880]
hey we're watching the game they need another five points to come to the spread

[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:39.860]
may the best woman's win now here's how to win and it's easy I believe i'm gonna win

[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:42.760]
in a truck time you maybe you'll see the real fun

[02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:44.940]
you and the obvious crowd

[02:07:46.740 --> 02:07:49.680]
know the final floor is going down

[02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:55.420]
and you're hoping you're that's not one to grab the cash and clean the pool

[02:07:55.420 --> 02:08:00.200]
well I guess as you win Mula you did good for yourself

[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:04.220]
well some you'll start just think now

[02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:08.920]
and picking random could be why

[02:08:09.860 --> 02:08:15.680]
grappling experts is my tell you it's better to go and choose the option or just guess

[02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:19.340]
that might be smarter how it's worth a try

[02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:24.800]
you ain't done anything and work yet

[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:29.900]
you're too busy filming brackets out when much madness comes around

[02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:32.760]
no more pulling around I gotta get back to work

[02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:34.640]
what's wrong with you get busy

[02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:39.300]
one o'one and five six to to show you what a bunch of malcontents we got out there

[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:45.460]
the Stephen Alexander guy he I already had his previous email in my pile and I was going to get to it

[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:51.020]
oh you didn't get to it fast enough put that that's right that's why he assumes automatically

[02:08:51.020 --> 02:08:56.320]
oh you won't read it because and so he sends it to me two more times well good read it three times

[02:08:56.320 --> 02:09:00.540]
that now total and when you hear it it's just oh somebody says mama can't it's also same be

[02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:05.980]
purple well good for her have another sandwich honey wow collect them all

[02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:12.000]
so Stephen his original email was south Florida fishing in joebell how you doing Neil

[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:17.060]
couple of days ago you had joebell on the air for a few seconds I was pleasantly surprised because

[02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:22.300]
the man who came on the radio that day was a complete opposite of the vile beast that you've

[02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:27.540]
been portraying for years not only did he sound like an ice guy but he sounded humbled too and

[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:35.440]
something to say he sounded scared too scared of you just wondering if anybody else in the

[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:40.340]
audience picked up the same thing I did for years now I've been theorizing that you see things

[02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:44.460]
your way but this immense it I see things my way is that doesn't everybody see things their way

[02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:49.660]
that's lost on my check if you're alive you see things your way I don't say things your way Stephen

[02:09:49.660 --> 02:09:53.640]
because I don't know you and I don't really care I'll give you another example my biggest

[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:57.440]
right for you is a listener I disagree with your hate for south Florida you can complain about

[02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:02.500]
whatever you want you have that right but I don't think you get what south Florida is about it's

[02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:06.240]
like if someone goes to see the godfather and then complaints there in enough explosions

[02:10:07.580 --> 02:10:11.580]
when George told you last week that some people went to Florida to fish you were confused about

[02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:16.460]
it because I think in your mind you can't understand that someone would spend their time fishing

[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:22.600]
yes some people love fishing my my hate to break the news to you Steve but my father was in a

[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:28.640]
fishing tackle business enough state in New York on candidate will ache and we used to go fishing

[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:35.880]
all the time we had a boat used to go fishing all the time oh no it's a great hobby and

[02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:41.080]
requires skill Florida's a piece of land surrounded by water why not go fishing I don't want that's

[02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:47.220]
why I don't want to not my idea of sticking a hook in the in the water and waiting till some fish

[02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:52.240]
comes along and bites on it and it goes down into its throat and in addition to which I don't eat

[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:58.580]
fish anyway so I should I want to go fishing your perception of reality is just wrong I bet nine

[02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:03.700]
out of ten people would agree with me rather fish instead of gambling like you or so in other

[02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:07.320]
words if I don't agree with what I want to do with my spare time that makes me a bad person

[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:13.740]
we all have to go step in line with Stephen and of course that that line about for years now

[02:11:13.740 --> 02:11:18.100]
I've been theorizing that you see things your way but this immense it first of all Job Bell is a

[02:11:18.100 --> 02:11:23.780]
fat ass miserable person okay whose main goal in life is to make everybody else as miserable as he is

[02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:29.740]
I hope you read this because if you have a legitimate response I'll listen but when you when

[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:36.980]
people ask you why Florida is what it is you just say it sucks it does suck the shopping here is

[02:11:36.980 --> 02:11:42.080]
great yeah we took a poll on that today shopping at one vote everything is great the weather is great

[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:46.420]
I love it here you don't need to go shopping in Rome like you claim downtown Miami has it all

[02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:51.240]
nowadays the best shops the best food the best of the best you prove that merely inhabiting a place

[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:56.540]
doesn't mean that you have lived there well guess what I lived there for almost 30 years and I don't

[02:11:56.540 --> 02:12:03.760]
like it it's got a lot of natural beauty it has a lot of attributes but the people like you Steven

[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:10.480]
tell me what I should think and what I should do if you enjoy fishing gags into your head have

[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:20.240]
a wonderful time so fish your brains out yes you like it yeah just checking checking what if you

[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:25.780]
liked it no and because I don't like it therefore that makes me a bad guy or whatever makes me I don't

[02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:33.160]
know glad you understand good and here's another malcontent really I'm sure yeah hate for Muslims

[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:40.740]
question mark this has got to be a make believe sure Baydar Madani at life in slow motion oh

[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:46.480]
dear neo-rogers I've never listened to your show except for a brief moment last week I wanted to

[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:52.260]
let you know how much you are offending people like me it was on 31909 a person which I consider

[02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:56.480]
to defend till now was giving me a ride somewhere in your station was on the radio you were talking

[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:00.460]
about certain things which I will not even repeat here because my mouth is not as dirty as yours

[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:06.040]
I didn't have a problem with anything I was hearing until you started saying something about

[02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:11.240]
gas prices and oil that's when the name Carling started you mentioned the word towel head around

[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:16.840]
five times and less than the 10 seconds I don't say towel head I said rag head I don't say towel head

[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:21.620]
I am a Muslim and take great offense to this when you take great offense to everything no doubt

[02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:26.480]
even cartoons even my friend felt uncomfortable with me in the car and listening to the

[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:31.320]
filth that was coming out of the radio I'm a Muslim and maybe that isn't a big portion of your

[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:35.140]
audience because there's so few of us here in Florida but why offend an entire people like that

[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:40.420]
and obviously you have no sense of humor either my Muslim friend fake this is fake this is probably

[02:13:40.420 --> 02:13:45.540]
what's his name john ZTR probably and once sentence you offended our religion and our race if you

[02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:50.480]
don't know it's a turban not a towel as you call it when you say things like that it shows ignorance

[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:56.000]
and complete disregard for other cultures you know what's sad and a few months I've lived in the

[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:01.900]
west have encountered very little racism people sometimes stare but that's expected no one that

[02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:06.940]
was called me by any names so I found it said that my encounter with racism happened by listening

[02:14:06.940 --> 02:14:11.280]
to the radio you don't know the kind of harm you're doing to people when you get on the radio you

[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:16.460]
also call black people the end word I hope not maybe it's okay to make fun of me because so

[02:14:16.460 --> 02:14:20.640]
few people will complain I will never understand people like you I hope you realize the words you

[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:27.760]
put out there heard by real people who are hurt by them yeah real people with no sense of humor if

[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:32.940]
you're for real which I doubt as for my friend if someone listens to a program that supports racism

[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:36.940]
and hate for others I don't know how we can continue our friendship but I'd rather know who my

[02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:41.580]
true friends are I hope you read this letter and realize how your words have power and my ex-friend

[02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:45.080]
tells me this is standard fare on your show his ex-friend

[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:52.980]
or here's Stephen Alexanderigan hi how you doing the oh I just read that

[02:14:56.980 --> 02:15:01.760]
you know I get that all the time people send me an email and of course during the course of the day

[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:08.440]
I build up a fairly sizable pile here if I can say that and I get to them when I can and the

[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:12.200]
earlier they come in the later they usually get read because they go to the bottom of the pile

[02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:16.900]
Jack says the you're right and you know the people here in South Florida are the rudest anywhere

[02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:22.640]
well I don't know about anywhere but they sure are rude and crude unfriendly nasty angry hot style

[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:31.220]
that I was up to at a 97 point and if you love it I and then I got these people to keep sending

[02:15:31.220 --> 02:15:35.240]
me all these pictures you know of brickle and all and great it's not going to change my mind

[02:15:36.100 --> 02:15:40.220]
it's kind of like I have to come around to their point if you in love all of what South

[02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:48.260]
Florida is becoming or whatever it is or or else I love it here I like the people I don't like

[02:15:48.260 --> 02:15:53.740]
the weather in a winter time but the winter is basically over nothing is perfect I don't like

[02:15:53.740 --> 02:15:59.400]
the driving here it sucks but I enjoy it I like the restaurants I just like the whole ambiance I

[02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:06.920]
like where I live and that's it I think that makes a lot of people very unhappy sure that's

[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:11.620]
rather because there's an old saying that I think it fits South Florida to a tea misery loves company

[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:16.560]
right so if I don't want to be down there and share the misery I was there long enough believe me a

[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:24.560]
long long time a long time and there are a lot of the people who are there I don't want to mention

[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:28.640]
George by name who wish they could get out who if they could afford to would be gone tomorrow

[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:37.360]
if they suddenly had a sack full of money yep gone tomorrow I'd certainly snow birded a little bit

[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:46.040]
yeah but I wouldn't like live here all the time you'd snow bird it yeah

[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:53.040]
I think you see things as you see them what kind of a sentence was that what are you saying

[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:57.100]
idiotic you see things the way you see them like yeah that's right we only two

[02:16:57.100 --> 02:17:01.220]

[02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:07.580]
by who we don't know he suspected this for years though and now he's on to me

[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:13.040]

that I'm a homo they'll just say he's married you know

[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:21.420]

[02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:28.880]
here's one it says I don't understand if the tamaltigers are recognized as a terrorist group

[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:33.020]
by the Canadian government why do they allow their supporters to demonstrate openly when they allow

[02:22:33.020 --> 02:22:45.220]
a al-Qaeda supporters demonstrate openly probably yes probably yes probably not certain groups

[02:22:47.740 --> 02:22:54.540]
like what you call it in Afghanistan yeah like a Taliban and I can stand because it's

[02:22:54.540 --> 02:23:01.060]
killing too many Canadian soldiers so you know that gets him pissed off although they keep sending more

[02:23:01.060 --> 02:23:06.420]
and more of them over there to get butchered but nevertheless yeah see this this emailer doesn't

[02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:11.060]
understand the Canadian government loves terrorists my camp driver's always talking about that

[02:23:12.180 --> 02:23:17.420]
that if you're like a clean cut clean shaven upstanding a looking person and you come through

[02:23:17.420 --> 02:23:23.060]
immigration here all we're gonna grill you and give us 40 pieces of idea but if you look like

[02:23:23.060 --> 02:23:30.400]
you've got a suicide bomb taped your ass oh come on in welcome to Canada a yeah how's it going a

[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:34.240]
welcome to Canada go out and demonstrate in the streets and disrupt traffic and screw up the city

[02:23:35.020 --> 02:23:37.360]
they never met a terrorist they didn't like here

[02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:43.020]
Chester Copperpot aka Jason says happy Monday to you and George

[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:48.260]
I bought some blue bill ice cream this weekend it was on sale at public so I took the plunge

[02:23:48.260 --> 02:23:52.920]
I never had it before but I had heard all the hype I got the neopolitan oh what a horrible

[02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:57.100]
choice not an elotrocklet in strawberry I figured that way I'd be able to try three flavors with one

[02:23:57.100 --> 02:24:03.260]
purchase I was not impressed although it was fairly smooth and creamy and had good flavor and nice

[02:24:03.260 --> 02:24:09.860]
pieces of strawberry definitely not a mechanical category of hogging days the one thing I was really

[02:24:09.860 --> 02:24:13.920]
surprised about when I read the ingredient list it contained high fructose corn syrup and

[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:20.960]
corn syrup solids no real sugar I hope I killed some good time for you I know your fat Jewish

[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:26.980]
loves food talk and I'm sure Paco infested your place with fleas Mexicans are notorious for being

[02:24:26.980 --> 02:24:37.660]
covered in them Chester Copperpot yeah sure and chickens pee too how sad yep and especially

[02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:44.000]
what's his name morning train whatever how did you figure that out I mean they explained it in an

[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:50.760]
email and you read anybody could put the do with such deductive forces to work see so you must have

[02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:57.880]
been listening to his crap I was reading it but not was listening to you yeah sunny oh but it was his

[02:24:57.880 --> 02:25:04.720]
crap right Bob and Kate crosses oh this is good I was a listener back in the 90s and moved to

[02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:10.380]
Ford Myers back then your show was not so political what happened when's the last time we talked about

[02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:15.860]
politics on his show politics still loving the others we should stick to what's funny like comedy

[02:25:15.860 --> 02:25:21.300]
so Bob and Kate Coral must be a right wing not job or something yeah do the show his way

[02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:27.880]
what yeah that's right here's another guy with show instruction critique yadda yadda just wish

[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:34.040]
you'd do it this way I'll do it whatever to help I want Bob Kate Coral My ass probably a

[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:39.860]
Bluenos redneck right we are on speaking a redneck I'm gonna tell you I decided last night

[02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:47.340]
that beyond the shadow of doubt there's one type of individual who offends me more than anything

[02:25:47.340 --> 02:25:52.000]
and anybody else in the world you know what that is I get on that movie American history X

[02:25:53.340 --> 02:26:04.040]
skinheads the fat skinhead friend the real big fat yeah yeah now that was unacceptable yeah he was

[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:12.500]
just unacceptable on every level am I right oh yeah oh yeah what I meant to say was

[02:26:13.020 --> 02:26:17.080]
Bill says why not just screen of calls wasn't that George's job originally says Bill

[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:23.880]
because when you screen a calls it's the same people putting somebody else on the phone for them

[02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:29.040]
and then when we put them on hold I'm your friend it's it doesn't do any good so Bill must be

[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:32.740]
buddies with the Joe Bell in addition to which you're not gonna have the capacity to screen

[02:26:32.740 --> 02:26:40.120]
the calls anyway right can you do it now I don't think so no we don't have the technical ability to

[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:45.220]
do that anymore we used to the full dot pushing for the calls I'm not taking calls it's already

[02:26:45.660 --> 02:26:50.500]
124 we only have 35 minutes left in the show today and I got plenty of stuff piled up here we

[02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:54.880]
were doing this fine just so you were straight on it the phone is connected now it's over there I

[02:26:54.880 --> 02:27:01.160]
could rearrange some furniture pull it around here and and possibly possibly in my work possible

[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:05.540]
and that news today we're gonna have when you move down the street I mean God only knows what

[02:27:05.540 --> 02:27:11.880]

fishing you said it sucks it doesn't I suppose it's better to gamble and hope you win a lot of money

[02:31:31.780 --> 02:31:35.700]
this is a pattern with you at work for example you just sit there putting in no effort and expect

[02:31:35.700 --> 02:31:43.300]
to be paid oh I do get paid big money I just know this that I don't know who you aren't ashamed

practically begging listeners to send oh why you aren't ashamed practically begging listeners to

[02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:52.400]
send emails every day maybe you actually fear having to do work I guess you can't expect someone

[02:31:52.400 --> 02:31:57.980]

carne says what the hell is wrong with these people I can't believe the world has made it this

[02:33:00.580 --> 02:33:05.720]
far man listeners Neil and George offer a point of view that is friggin entertainment great entertainment

[02:33:05.720 --> 02:33:10.380]
nothing more a format that people like David Letterman others with shows copy and admire that's

[02:33:10.380 --> 02:33:16.300]
right letterman copies this show you bet only differences other shows don't let us participate so

[02:33:16.300 --> 02:33:22.140]
why the hate people stop wasting time bickering and sniveling about the bad in these emails it's the

[02:33:22.140 --> 02:33:26.060]
same hate ass point of view you have in your regular lives it's the same thing that makes your lives

wow rudy says I always find it funny when Muslims get offended by comments that you make

[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:08.840]
in regard to their race Muslims are possibly the people on the slope with the driest sense of

[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:13.020]
humor why should we even bother to understand them as they in their corane states that we are all

[02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:18.440]
infidels what muzzle muzzle and other fanatics seem to realize not to realize is that religion is

[02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:21.720]
the one thing through our history to bring the most amount of hate and responsible for the most

[02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:28.320]
amount of death I think we've all a little bit of hatred in us so in essence we all are a little

[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:32.780]
racist having said that have you ever heard a muslim leader speak openly against terrorism

[02:34:32.780 --> 02:34:36.160]
have you ever seen a muslim make an effort to have any other person of a different race or religion

[02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:48.420]
understand their beliefs the million dollar question is it true that not every Muslim is a

[02:34:48.420 --> 02:34:52.980]
ugly rag they walk around with how do you like that rudy says every terrorist is a Muslim how do you

[02:34:52.980 --> 02:35:01.140]
like that yeah I don't think that's the case but no no well that's what rudy says and yeah I have

[02:35:01.140 --> 02:35:05.880]
every terrorist how about the Tamil tigers are they Muslims right I have a Muslim leaders speak out

[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:12.760]
yeah well rudy is a bigot need is not admitted you know he is what the other fake emailer was

[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:18.560]
accusing me of being I would like nice muslims if ever made any I'm sure maybe right in this

[02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:23.220]

in a week yeah and transparently fake barber and sunrise whose for real says

[02:40:49.540 --> 02:40:53.320]
i looked at the book to godfather coined the book mo green was killed by al niri

[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:57.400]
i think al is the same guy that kills frito have a good one guys is barber and sunrise

[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:01.500]
well thanks barber but we already knew that al niri killed him in the book but not in the movie

[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:06.560]
right because in the movie al niri kills baudzini and since this was all happening

[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:13.040]
happening simultaneously while the baptism was going on he couldn't have been in two places at

[02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:20.640]
the same time that's correct but al niri did kill frito he went fishing frito but nevertheless

[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:25.040]
i guess whatever find out who killed mo green i'm gonna have to watch it again i guess

[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:29.700]
i don't know why because we've already had to confirm you don't see the person you just see

[02:41:29.700 --> 02:41:34.020]
somebody approaching maybe you'll recognize the back of his head or his ear

[02:41:34.020 --> 02:41:38.740]
yeah that might be something maybe it was that bodyguard that real creepy bodyguard that michael had

[02:41:38.740 --> 02:41:44.140]
right in havana he didn't do too good the bodyguard he got like

[02:41:44.140 --> 02:41:46.460]
hello didn't do too good black in the shots

[02:41:47.300 --> 02:41:50.700]
didn't soak up the bullet and then the same thing with the assassin the guy that shot

[02:41:50.700 --> 02:41:56.700]
