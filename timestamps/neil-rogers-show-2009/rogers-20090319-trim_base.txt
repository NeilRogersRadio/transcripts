[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820]
The music expressed on the video.

[00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.820]
That man didn't say I will win back in the Russian house cramps to your heart.

[00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.140]
Not for a day, I'll win.

[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.860]
I'll win that script.

[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.600]
Oh, no, I'm gonna cry and see you.

[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.120]
You're a boring little artist for a day.

[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:40.900]
5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7

[00:00:40.900 --> 00:01:04.920]
9, 9,

[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.440]
were on a control. There's so hungry. There are so hungry.

[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.960]
Madness. Madness. Crazy bitches out here.

[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.120]
Oh, there's some crazy bitches all over the place. There's no question about that.

[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.660]
Well, so Brittany was here. That sounds a little like the crazed Brittany fan,

[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.760]
doesn't it? Little tiny, tiny bit. Obviously, that was a chick.

[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.460]
I understand. That's what I'm saying. It's like a chick version of the crazed.

[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.480]
Well, at any rate, she did the concert last night. I got another one tonight here.

[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.580]
And I guess it was just fine from the spy report I got very briefly because they were like,

[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.220]
you know, after the concert, you go out with your friends and your party and get drunk and

[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.340]
whatever like that. Spend a lot of money before the concert after the concert during that concert.

[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.380]
That's right during the concert. That's what concerts are all about.

[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.220]
And that's right. No, just plastered, getting wasted. You bet.

[00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.380]
The douse down 34 points. And we got another dead celebrity. Oh, Jesus.

[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.000]
Who now? Tasha Richardson. Oh, yeah, yeah. It's all over the place. Yeah.

[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.860]
I don't know who she is. You've seen her. She's been in a lot of movies. And what?

[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.100]
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know the movies that you've seen. But if you saw her face

[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.560]
or something, you'd go, oh, yeah, that chick. Yeah, she's been in so many things. Tony,

[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.820]
winning an actress and Natasha Richardson died after suffering a head injury during a skiing

[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.060]
accident. The age of 45. First, it was sunny. Bono. And then who else was William Kennedy?

[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.820]
Smith, right. The other one. The other Kennedy. Wasn't it?

[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.820]
William, wasn't William Kennedy Smith the guy that was the other one? Yeah, the right.

[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.340]
Yeah. What are the other ones? One of the other Kennedy clan, Jess,

[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.980]
Dynastine, and Jess. I just don't, the whole thing with a skiing. I just don't get it. I'm sorry.

[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.960]
I mean, you know, I know an old funny dirty. I just, I don't understand it. It's fun.

[00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.720]
Yeah, going fast is fun. Well, I can go down, get my vent and go get on a highway and go

[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.840]
a hundred, a few miles an hour if I want to. That's illegal. And probably get me killed,

[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.700]
but nevertheless, there you go. It's not fun at less. You could get killed.

[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.420]
Oh, well, she's had must had a lot of fun. That's right. Right up until it was taken out

[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.980]
life support earlier yesterday. Alan Neera, the LA based publicist for her husband, Liam Neeson,

[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.640]
confirmed her death in a written statement. And it goes down with the statement. I don't want to,

[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.340]
I didn't give details of the cause of death for Richardson. It suffered a head injury when she

[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.160]
fell on a beginner's trail during a private ski lesson at the luxury mom trim boss ski resort in

[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.720]
Quebec. Oh, in Quebec, she was hospitalized Tuesday. I might say I'll later flow to a hospital in

[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.540]
New York City. Now, Gornesh, Telfan, Vanessa Redgrave, Richardson's mother. Did you know that?

[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:52.360]
Yes. I thought it was shocking news. No, arrived in a car with darkened windows was taken through a

[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.080]
gate when she arrived at the Lennox Hill Hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side around 5 pm

[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.360]
yesterday. But an hour earlier, Richardson's sister, Joly, arrived alone was formed by the media.

[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.620]
She entered through the back of the hospital by the paparazzi by these grave robbers. They're just

[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.900]
brutal. On Broadway, she won a Tony Award for performance in Sally Bowles in the 1998 revival

[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.220]
of Cabaret. She also appeared in New York in a production of Patrick Marbury's Closer.

[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:29.580]
Is that Closer or Closer? I don't know. God, you're as dumb as I am. As well as 2005 revival

[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.120]
at Tennessee, William Streetcar named desire in which he played Blanche opposite John C. Riley

[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:45.080]
Stanley Kowalski. And it goes on. She later co-starred with what? She played the title character

[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.560]
in Paul Schrader's Patty Hurst. And later co-starred with Nissen and Nell with Mia Faroe and

[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.380]
Widow's Peak. And with a preteen Lindsay Lohan to make a remake of Parent Trap. I didn't see any

[00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.260]
of these movies. She was born in London in 1963. Boy, 45 years old now she's dead. Her screen

[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.420]
debut came with the age of four. Good thing she got an early start because she got an early exit.

[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.680]
45 and she's dead. Skeeing accident. I don't understand that whole thing. I don't know, just

[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.920]
the agony of victory and the thrill of defeat. Is that how it goes? Yeah. Well people bash their

[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.800]
head just walking across the room, you know. Trip there's Dr. Bob, right? A little slip and fall.

[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.140]
Hit it said on the sidewalk and now long since you had to slip and fall yourself. See, you can

[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:37.480]
dive in and like die. Right. But you could have. I could have, I guess. Broke a bone in my hand,

[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.940]
though. In fact, I still got a scar. Sure, you could have broke your skull. Now I could have

[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.800]
broke my skull right there and I'm stood on. That would be a good place to break it.

[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.060]
Oh, look at this. Florida, Marlon, Sweden, Stadium, Deal from Imean, Dade County. They're trying

[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.260]
really desperately before that vote today. They're really sucking around very heavy duty and if they,

[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.100]
and let me tell you this, this shows you how many stupid, oh, I just, it makes me wild.

[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.120]
Should elected officials approve the stadium? The hero is running this poll.

[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.920]
Yes, we need new stadium for the Marlon's 52% know it's physically responsible 48%.

[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.280]
Let's just close the, let's close all the schools down to how with education, how with the kids,

[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.800]
and let's just build all kinds of stadiums and arenas and all kinds of crap. What do you say?

[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.520]
All right. Let's get our priorities in order.

[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.160]
On the eve of the most important vote in franchise history, the Florida Marlins

[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.340]
agreed to crucial contract changes. The team hopes will help secure its elusive permanent home

[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.860]
in South Florida. Well, pack your salami sandwiches. Okay, get lost.

[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.340]
Miami commissioners will decide today whether to approve a handful of contracts related to a new 37,000

[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.720]
seat retractable roof stadium in Little Havana or in nobody wants to go. Even they little have

[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.600]
unease don't want to go there. If the vote passes at the city level, the stadium is fate moves to

[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.680]
the Dade County Commission where the team's long running pursuit of a new facility could be settled

[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:07.000]
on Monday. Ooh, getting really tense ain't it? Oh yeah. That was down 26 points. No big deal.

[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.460]
No biggie. And Sirius is down to 38 cent. It was all the way up to 40 cent. Now it's 38 and dropping.

[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.520]
The most significant contract change with Guarantee. I'm going to sneeze this thing.

[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.900]
Eee. I will. Hey.

[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.200]
At least I gave you warning. My most significant contract change with Guarantee

[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.120]
substantially more money to Miami and Dade County should the team change ownership

[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:39.020]
after new stadium rises. Oh, it's going to rise like like a pie in the oven. Her cake is at a

[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:46.160]
cake or a pie that rises. Cake cake bread bread rises. Yes. I know some other things that rise to

[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.420]
another change includes a team commitment to pay half a million dollars year to local charities

[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.760]
with 125 grand going of the city and county for baseball related programs in their parks in the

[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.220]
first seven years. Those measures put into the working contract on Tuesday address some

[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.360]
concerns from elected officials, especially the fear that the marlins could sell the team for a

[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:11.800]
quick profit after getting a stadium built largely with public money. And it goes on and on and

[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.960]
consistently among the bottom tier of major league baseball and payroll and attendance.

[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.640]
The two time world series champion marlins believe the $634 million stadium project will cure

[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.620]
many of its ills. Well, why don't we just give you that I would give a $634 million to Jeffrey

[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:35.100]
and David Samson and Delilah over to that. I mean at this time when everybody is broke when we

[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.460]
got all these ripoffs and scams and birdie made off and AIG and everybody made off with everybody

[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:44.820]
else's money and a bank's city group. Everybody's a big crook. And in the meantime, oh, let's build a

[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:50.700]
stadium for these millionaires. Well, screw them. Screw them, but they won't do it. You know, the fix is

[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:57.980]
in right. It's always in the fix was in for the match the what you call the Mickey slip you the

[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:05.140]
Mickey arena there with mayor a wini pecania. They needed that. Doftus. In fact, it was interesting what

[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:10.800]
they said. Doftus, they be a locking cup. Yeah. That's what mayor a penny said. Teeny,

[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.180]
penny in his bikini. Whatever happened to him. He did. And whatever happened to our former close

[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:23.240]
personal friend. What that was his name? Who that went off to become his assistant. Juan

[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:30.460]
Mandietta. Juan Mandietta. Right. I forgot all about him. He was the parrot on the mayor's shoulder.

[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:39.660]
Licking and kissing and Juan Mandietta. We got a bit on that. Yes, you probably nobody remembers

[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:47.880]
who that is. Juan Mandietta. That's enough. Just to prove we got a bit. Not too many people we got a bit

[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:54.420]
about. I'd you hear that Jim Skyler stuff yesterday except some of those sound effects that

[00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:00.160]
got in there will be accused of playing in all like right on their raspberries. Okay. Raspberry.

[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:07.420]
That's a raspberry. Get it straight. Joyce. Oh, no, I can tell that sounded like somebody passing

[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.860]
flat. She lends to me. I will screw you. Go pass it in the hall yard and in the somewhere.

[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.640]
Go out there at the beastly headquarters and just waddle up and down the hallway farting your

[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:28.540]
brains out Joyce. I'm sure they'll be impressed big time. Do you think she ever fart? Yeah, I bet she

[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:35.700]
she does a lot. She's probably got like a thing about it. She's probably got to hang up about it.

[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.240]
She fart so much. Oh, we don't want any fart sounds on the radio. She probably parts into a whoopie

[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.320]
cushion and inflates it and then refarts. I wonder she farts in the shower. She probably heard me

[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:50.140]
talking about that. Oh, what a spectacular sensational sensation that is before everybody

[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:57.260]
croaks they must fart in the shower. I mean real aromatic in a hot steamy shower. I'm sure everyone

[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:02.480]
has. How do you know that? Oh, come on now. What are the? You're sure everybody is farted in the

[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:08.680]
shower and then how can one not? People take showers and the frequency with which people fart. That's

[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:13.520]
another reason not to take a bath. Oh, no, you're going to enjoy them in there too. No, not that's

[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:24.100]
the same. You make bubbles. Yeah. Oh, my God. No, no comparison. I didn't say there was but still.

[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.260]
And then of course, if you fart in the bathtub, then you're sitting in it. Yeah, you can also try to

[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:36.260]
bite the bubbles as they come up. Mm hmm. Or just sniff the bubbles. Mm hmm. Anyway, let's not

[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.200]
start getting it all at the excretory stuff because then we'll get slapped on the hand. No, we heard

[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:47.140]
you played a couple of parts and they were a raspberry. That's right. Get it right. Okay, let's do the

[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:52.880]
break because we got your poll. Is it your poll? No, yours. You're in. None of them are my polls. I

[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.020]
just I got so many of them lined up here from the audience. I don't know what got into them

[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.940]
last couple of weeks. But boy, every day I got all kinds of polls to choose from. I didn't say any

[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.840]
good ones, but what? Well, they don't have to be good. They just have to be. They just got to be

[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:10.660]
something. Right. I'm Mark Morgan. Now here's Neil Rogers on 560 Q8M.

[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.200]
The flagship stage in the floor please. Oh, no.

[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:24.520]
I'm now with Leia. It's time to change the station. Turn it off and turn on your iPod.

[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:30.800]
Some stupid sport host lives who don't care about their jobs. Are you laying off the audience?

[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:36.320]
Is it great? Is it struck? I want a phase fall. That's the brakes of me, Carol. You're right.

[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:38.540]
You're a

[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.420]
sportsman. It's a UAMs faggot sport.

[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.980]
Of hockey. He's in the list.

[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.860]
Welcome. They don't care if they did.

[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.900]
Yeah, they program for the sisters with their nose embedded deeply in job straps.

[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.860]
They kiss each other's thighs while oggling sport hold eyes and murdering the audience

[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:12.480]
for only what they like. It's Marlon's phase fall. They rape they all are numbers. Marlon's phase fall.

[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.200]
You can't get any dumber. The management here don't give a crap what you think.

[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:23.160]
They're busy dreaming bout an athlete's king. Speaking to me. He's fall.

[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.720]
With all the sports crap.

[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.140]
You'd be a baby. He's fall.

[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.860]
He's max of four whole ass.

[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.960]
Four whole ass. I don't think you better ask if we can say that.

[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:44.460]
1017 at 560 WQM. Happy 3G3. We got the big O at Boat Campers at 2. We got your

[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.920]
management Boat Campers at 4. A lot of stuff going on at Boat Campers. That's 7

[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.440]
of midnight. We got college hoops, baby. Oh yeah. College hoops. Hoops in Heaton. Hoops in Hoot.

[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:59.160]
And whatever. We got two idiotic emails. You surprised? Uh, no.

[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.180]
Here's one that says now let me ask you this. How many years have I been screaming about

[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.160]
even going back to the John Henry days when they were begging for new stadium? How many years

[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.220]
have I been screaming about that? What a waste of it. It's unacceptable. Absolutely.

[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:16.020]
No. Here's one says, oh nice of you to finally start talking about what a waste of stadium is.

[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.560]
I guess you finally decided to do a little local talk for a change. A little too late though.

[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.820]
Yeah. If I would have started talking about a hundred years ago, that would have stopped it.

[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.520]
Not at all. You're fault. I've been screaming about this crap for a long, long time.

[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:36.060]
Just keep pretending. And here's one from me, mirried a b-o-ch. Do you remember this idiot?

[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:43.560]
No. Oh yeah. Wait till you hear the content of this. The stadium topic is a great way to start

[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.680]
some listener calls, try and forgive and give your fans a chance. Screw you. This has got to be

[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:57.380]
one of the chronics. Me. No kidding. Really? Yeah. Great way to start some listener calls.

[00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.480]
Well, what's there to talk about? Well, what's there to discuss?

[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.120]
And the Harold Paul 52% of these idiots say, oh yeah, we need to stay here for the marlins.

[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:11.280]
You know who those people are, don't you? The sports nerd crowd, right? The lifeless. I have no life. Idiots.

[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.840]
Ball games come first. Everything else is secondary. Okay. Screw education. Screw the school.

[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:21.160]
Screw the kids. Screw anything else. Screw anything that moves.

[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.800]
So anyway, there's a two brilliant emails to get us started today. Oh nice of you to finally start

[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:33.100]
talking about the stadium thing. Yeah. Nobody has screamed and carried on and belly-aked in the

[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:42.080]
in the Gornestolphin. Now why are they sending me this again to nobody cared about this yesterday

[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:47.020]
and the the punk at the Harold, by the way, he screwed up the story the first time. He didn't know

[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.080]
the difference between quarter horse racing and harness racing. He doesn't know his answer

[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:56.680]
is elbow. So here's the thing. Highly okayed for quarter horse racing.

[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:08.140]
Meanwhile, state representative Steve Bovo Republican of higher Leah is there anything else

[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.200]
as introduced a bill that if approved by the Florida legislature could allow highly park to

[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.520]
resume thermo racing in the limited form under its quarter horse permit. The bill of

[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.880]
permit quarter horse tracks in Florida to hold thermo races from to 50% of meets races

[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.500]
even on a thermo track within a 50 mile radius is holding a meet and without their authorization.

[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.100]
Gulfstream parking call to race course are both within 15 miles of highlyah.

[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.360]
But a meat but a boop but about quarter horses. Boy, that's real crap. That's garbage.

[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.800]
And believe you me, if any place deserves doesn't need more garbage but deserves it, it's highlyah.

[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:50.140]
What a toilet. I mean, I lived at highlyah lakes way way back when,

[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:59.140]
77, 78. That wasn't too bad. There were good restaurants around all that.

[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.520]
And 49th street, all 103rd street, excuse me. Right.

[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:08.560]
Well, highlyah is one of the only cities in the world. It's got like every street's got two

[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.860]
numbers, two different names. Oh, they got more like that in this town.

[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.160]
They do? Yeah. Like where? 41 right here has got like five different names.

[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:22.480]
Stay road seven. Right. North West Avenue. The blue star memorial highway.

[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.780]
Blue star memorial highway. What the hell is that?

[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.720]
Something. I don't know. It's got like five different names on there.

[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:33.780]
Boy, it's about why why not open the phones up and let's get some input. Not your dreaming.

[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.380]
You are dreaming. I was just thinking about that this morning while I was sitting on the throne.

[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.400]
How much how much more wonderful life is in the show is and how we made that big comeback in

[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.620]
January. Now that we finally schmit can't all those stupid calls, the calls suck. The emails are,

[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.600]
you know, some of them are okay and a lot of them suck too, but at least at least it's more

[00:17:53.600 --> 00:18:01.220]
controllable. They're more malleable. That that was up 32 cents. Here's the pull result from

[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:06.020]
yesterday. 700 votes and then I chopped it off. Kind of like in that movie. What's the movie again?

[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.560]
Runes the runes the ruins.

[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.560]
Like I was on again last night on about 50 different channels on the cable and I just

[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.320]
it got to the part where he was slicing her leg because the plant was like in in her leg,

[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.880]
you know, right? He was pulling it out and she was screaming and yelling.

[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.180]
Looking at that bottle of booze though for you know to always carry booze.

[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:34.960]
Always carry booze to drink and also to like sanitize any operations you're going to do.

[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.840]
Kill the germs. Does that call really kill germs or is that just yes? Yes it does.

[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.340]
Not necessarily everything not like all bacteria or something but yeah it does a job.

[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.000]
Maybe I'll go bathing some good idea. When you get to be old like me you probably got all kinds

[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.660]
of stuff crawling around. You know, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that nothing surprises me

[00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:00.920]
anymore. 998. That was a cop out vote and it won hands down 298. And by the way,

[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:05.060]
Quits and me stupid the emails about Randy Molar. Okay. He's an embarrassment. He's an ex-joc.

[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:10.700]
He's not a broadcaster and nobody has to have the audience. The fans call in your a goal calls.

[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:15.980]
I mean, that's one of the dumbest ideas. It's a substitute for talent for being a real broadcaster.

[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:21.620]
Oh, let's take every ex-jocke. Let's make him. In fact, I noticed now the new deal is that every NHL

[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:27.880]
player coach players who retire coaches who get fired out of their all on TV. They're all on there.

[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.180]
They'll just stick a microphone in front of their face and all of a sudden they're a broadcaster.

[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.060]
Anyway, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Marlon's left South Florida 65 all not before we build

[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:42.780]
him that big expensive beautiful stadium. In Little Havana where nobody wants to go to.

[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:48.900]
George has an STD 44. Jimmy Cifilis was replaced into voice in the dolphins 40. There's another example.

[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:55.420]
ex-jocke. Horrible. George got his own show on QAM 34. Joyce decided that breathing while on the

[00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:01.680]
year should be prohibited 27. Neil won big on the slots in retire 26. The beastly sold WDQAM 25.

[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.300]
I would not be surprised to learn that Joyce is a virgin 22. Gas reached five bucks a gallon 22.

[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.560]
He had those ragheads man. They're going to start putting the pressure around again. You'll see.

[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.120]
Pressure. Maria hasn't chimed it with us all week long. Has she?

[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.540]
Maria B. Well, back to her.

[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.600]
Neil moved back to plantation in Randframere 21. Neil is hospitalized in diabetic coma 21.

[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.900]
There's finally peace in the Middle East 19. Joyce and Joe Bell are doing the nasty 10.

[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.420]
My son or daughter is gay 8. George moved back to Montana became a monk 5.

[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.520]
I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the US oil supplies cut off 5. My mother did heavy

[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:42.360]
drugs while pregnant with me 4. My wife or husband is having an affair 4. That's the pull from

[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:49.880]
yesterday. Yeah, what today would be a great day to open up the phones and discuss that stadium issue.

[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.060]
Yeah, that would have a tremendous impact on it. No question about that.

[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.140]
The die is cast. They've already smeared the right people and in the right places and that's

[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:08.340]
the way it works. Oh, Brandon's got a pull. The worst thing about television today. Okay, thanks,

[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:15.880]
Brandon. And I had another one on here and I just lost it. Oh, no.

[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:24.560]
Where is it? Oh, can Paul and the Q's get a shameless birthday request for something?

[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:32.800]
Oh, no, that's from yesterday. Get tarman. I lost it. Can you believe that? No.

[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:42.360]
Oh, this is just crap. That's most of what comes in on here. Crap. And then they then they then they

[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:47.000]
request to oh, they want to know if you actually read it. They want you to report back. That's right.

[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:58.700]
To see if you read their crap. Oh, my God. Anyway, moving along. Yoshi Schmendrick says Joe Rose must

[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:04.600]
be looking at his chops. He says I can't believe that South Florida talk radio is run by children.

[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.980]
These idiots across the street talk of a game. But other than Le Bastard, they got nothing.

[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.640]
And John Lee Jones clearance. They're too busy with the ball games. The Kane's shack.

[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.240]
GD on Pistoff says Yoshi Schmendrick.

[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.180]
790 wanted to know if Kenny Walker was still available. Think about it. Kenny,

[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:25.200]
Sadano, girl to be named and also Zazlo, great morning show. They don't even have a morning show

[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.920]
on their website. They haven't figured it out yet. So from 6 to 10, I guess they're off the year.

[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.400]
Oh, Neil. You're listening to Neil Rogers. Well, here we go again.

[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:39.160]
I'm South Florida. 24 years later. 560 Q AM. Neil Rogers, God.

[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:50.540]
Real American eight holes. Real American eight holes. We salute you. Mr. Peep show booth.

[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:56.700]
Mopper upper. Mr. Peep show booth. Mopper upper. You were dismissed from your last job as a high school

[00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:04.020]
custodian for leering at students in the girls locker room. Not a brother. But now it seems you found

[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:09.000]
your true calling as you punched the clock at Main Street adult book and video.

[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:17.240]
Night after night, you march into those private viewing booths onto the gills with cleaning

[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:26.420]
solvents, scouring pads and blind ambition. There are awkward moments when you accidentally walk in

[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:33.780]
other clients. But that's okay because Mr. Smith knows you're there to make his viewing experience

[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:42.380]
cleaner, safer and most importantly, clear. So we salute you. Mr. Peep show booth. Mopper upper.

[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:50.780]
Your paper towels. Your umni and your scraper. You are a real American eight hole.

[00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.980]
10 32 at 5 60 WQ AM. So here's really a promising email. We got almost nothing by the way.

[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.360]
Neil at Neil Rogers dot com for the emails. We got very little in there. We got enough to go to

[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:11.560]
about 10 40. And then they're going to spin some wax. All right. Or you just put on the audio

[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:18.160]
from the TV. There's always a push from new broad. What? Huh? Anyway, William says ever since it

[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:24.200]
started raining down here, your signal went bye bye. I can hear every AM station, but yours. What

[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:31.880]
gives? We're vanishing. We're vanishing from the air. We have no signal. We have no promotion. We

[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.740]
have no support. We have no management. We have no nothing. But we're still on the air.

[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.580]
Also, I plan on going to the Isle of Compre tonight. It says they say it's 10 times.

[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.900]
10 times the points Thursday. What is that? How the hell do I know what it is? Do you know what it is?

[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:50.360]
No. And is it hard to win that night? Like I know something about Alec Capri. You go there.

[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:57.020]
What they did to the horseman there, what they've done to the whole operation is just a butchery.

[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.840]
It's kind of like what Joe Bells done to this radio station. That's what the Alec Capri has done

[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:05.720]
in Pompano Park. So and then it says emailed back because I can't hear for craft. Thanks, William.

[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:10.640]
Oh, yeah, I'm going to email you back. Can you like that? Get to it. Would you?

[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:16.220]
Email back. Don't bother. I can't hear you for craft. Get lost, William. Hope you lose your ash

[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:21.700]
there with a stupid email like that. Jesus God. Well, the vote tally has changed a little bit. They're

[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:27.180]
on a hurled pole on the stadium. You think it's just coincidence or maybe since I mentioned it,

[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:31.860]
some people have finally decided like get pissed off and fired up. Yeah. Should elected officials

[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:39.860]
approve the stadium. Yes, 50% no 50% yes, 410 no, 410 the six out of 816 vote.

[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:46.320]
And those 410 people will say, Oh, yes, we need new stadium for the Marlins. Those people ought to be

[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:52.520]
shot. They ought to be lined up right on brick alive and to in shot. Put it on Channel 7 hysterical news.

[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.860]
God. Oh, and somebody also gave me a bunch of crap about all that thing yesterday. If you would go

[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:07.800]
to snopes.com, that thing about the chicken who wants to be a millionaire. Yeah. So, so who cares

[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.680]
whether it was real or not? I thought it was amusing. It's cute. Yeah, it was cute as hell. Oh, no,

[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:20.440]
you got to go to snopes.com. I think you're losing it. Old man. Yeah, screw you. Oh, no, another death.

[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.220]
Somebody you wouldn't know. In fact, somebody I know only because of an old like I said, an old goat.

[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.560]
An old goat. In fact, a lot of these emailers, that's what they want to do. They want to get my

[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:45.120]
goat. Right. Oh, the S&P is up here. A tad. The S&P is up near the S&P is up. I wonder what happened

[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:50.980]
on that guy. Probably blew his brains out. The Dow is down four and a half points. A fool in his

[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.860]
money are soon parted. And by the way, all that business about Jim Kramer, that part of it is true.

[00:26:54.860 --> 00:27:00.000]
However, he's only one. I mean, he, you know, at least he jumps up and down and he acts like

[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.200]
the jackass that they are. Right. As opposed to the rest of them who act like pseudo intellectuals,

[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:10.580]
well, the markets under pressure, and I'd still have an urge from Maria B. He's probably going into

[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:19.320]
hiding. Crazy bitch. Why do you lock men is dead? 90 or 82? Why do you lock men for a space and

[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.320]
outfielder? Would you let me finish and then you'll find out who is a baseball guy? Oh,

[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.260]
that's why you wouldn't know who that was. First of all, whitey Ford, whitey lockman. What kind of

[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.100]
other guy is he named whitey? Do you know anybody named whitey? Yeah. I do. Who?

[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.580]
Whitey bridges the former owner of Treasure Island. Good old boy. Good friend of mine. Well,

[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:43.080]
I ain't the only one. You know, other whiteies? Yeah. I know a few whiteies. Well then.

[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.640]
Whitey lockman, a first-basement outfielder, 15 Major League seasons best known for scoring a

[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.920]
head of Bobby Thompson on the historic shot herd round the world. The Giants win the pennant.

[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.080]
Home run in 1951 reportedly as Diedy was 82. That's all it says.

[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:02.480]
Says thanks for visiting MLB.com where baseball is always on. Well, in my house,

[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.400]
baseball is always off. I wouldn't watch you if you paid me by the pitch. And this from somebody

[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:16.380]
used to be a rabid fan, but oh, talk about boring and ponderous and mediocre. See, some of the

[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.800]
other sports like football, you can handle a rampant mediocrity because there's some intrinsic

[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.580]
excitement, but baseball is so intrinsically boring that when you've got all these minor league

[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:29.900]
players dressed up like Major League guy and all these ridiculous salaries. Well,

[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.860]
a medueling protest outside and with a packed chamber inside, Miami commissioners began

[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:40.260]
discussion this morning, whether the secure their end of the Florida, Marlon, $634 million

[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:45.520]
stadium plan. Almost a half hour after the meeting was started in 9 a.m. Marlon's representatives

[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:50.380]
including team president David Samson were still working the hallways to secure final votes. How do

[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:54.840]
you like that expression? They were working the hallways. They're greasing and smearing.

[00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:00.700]
If the vote passes in Miami City Hall, the stadium is fed as off to Dade County Hall on Monday

[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.780]
for what could be the final showdown on the franchise's decade-long search for a permanent home.

[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:10.580]
Yeah, they've had their hat in their hand all the way through. Oh, we got to have a stadium. Yeah,

[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.660]
and then the same people who don't care about it now, why it's right there at the Dade County

[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:18.200]
Dade Broward line right off the name Turnpike. They're going to schlep to Little Havana to go and

[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:24.320]
subsidize it, which they're not, which they are not. It'll be a novelty for a very short while,

[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.020]
and then after that like, oh geez, we don't want to go all the way down there and see that crap.

[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:37.100]
That this is a case of somebody just refusing to take no. The areas already said no to majorly

[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.080]
baseball for a line. Even when they had their big seasons, no, we don't care. We're not going to go.

[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:47.540]
We will not support the lowest attendance. And, and, you know, oh no, we want the stadium. That's

[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:52.260]
going to cure all the ills. Build us a stadium early this morning. City officials were passing around

[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:56.680]
the latest changes to the stadium contract plan. The Marlins had agreed to significantly increase

[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.680]
the share of profits. Miami and Dade County would receive should team owner Jeffrey Luria sell the

[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:05.340]
ball club within nine years of the start of construction. The new numbers began at 70% of any

[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.720]
profit and descend to 5% in the year nine. The old agreement that it echoes on with numbers. Do you

[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.980]
care about numbers? No, neither do I. Too many numbers.

[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:22.480]
So there you go. There's the poll on the whole website. It's amazing that the

[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.260]
girls actually got 816 people who read that crap.

[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.940]
Oishmoiju is back in. We got like we got branded in Oishmoiju and then we got me and we got

[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:36.560]
about five people. Right. Oh, brand new. I'm just going to give you a little heads up if you

[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:41.560]
should catch South Park. I know George watched it features the debut of a superhero known as the

[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.820]
Koon. I'm sure just like in South Park by the end of the week you'll be able to buy your own

[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:51.100]
who is Koon T-shirt. I see. The very week episode. Consider it. Consider it.

[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.840]
Consider it. Consider it. The last weeks which you must see if you have a look.

[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.360]
I still didn't see the one with a Jonas Brothers. You want to know why?

[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.460]
Wallphones ringing. I'll be back. Oh, please.

[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.620]
I'll be back.

[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:29.900]
More automated spam calls. This is Natalie in the yadda yadda yadda. This is a big scam.

[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.460]
About auto insurance and they don't even have a car that you want. It's just a scam. You know

[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:41.060]
that deal? Have you gotten those calls? Yeah. Natalie, if I could find Natalie,

[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:48.040]
we could solve all the problems. Oh, no. You're listening to Neil Rogers. Well, here we go again.

[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:55.760]
On some port is 20 years later. 560 Q AM. Oh, God, Neil. Do you have to take your daughter,

[00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.500]
Sissy? The new Jonas Brothers movie. Oh, my God. The Jonas Brothers. You need the Jonas Brothers

[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.640]
movie survival kit. Each survival kit comes with a sleep mask so you don't have to watch,

[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:09.600]
earplugs so you don't have to hear, and a sign I'd capsule just in case the mask and plugs don't

[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:16.620]
work. Oh, my God. The Jonas Brothers. The Jonas Brothers movie survival kit. You can make it. The film

[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:21.340]
is only 76 minutes long. I had a Jonas Brothers. You made those earplugs. Oh, my God. The

[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:28.420]
Jonas Brothers. And the sign I'd. Oh, my God. The Jonas Brothers 3D concert experience survival kit.

[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.960]
It's too late for me. Save yourselves. So do you think the signal is really like vanished

[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:38.680]
entirely? We've been working in that direction for quite some time now. Well, success then. All right,

[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:44.820]
let's hear it. We've been feverishly trying to like make the entire signal vanish from the

[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:50.360]
radio dial on 560. And I think we've got it today based on William's email. Although that's the

[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.560]
only one. Wouldn't you think if people were like having an extraordinarily difficult time hearing?

[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:59.460]
Well, we'll see. We'll see what? We'll see what other people say.

[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:07.960]
Oh, here's the poll. And somebody gives me a song to dance about. Where's the option for this

[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:13.380]
place sucks? I can't wait to leave. It's not that kind of a poll, okay? Justin missing a critical

[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:18.480]
choice on your poll. We're not missing anything on the poll. Justin, if you read the question,

[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:25.340]
the best thing about being in South Florida is. See, somebody sends in a pie. I got a

[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:33.740]
choice here in a minute. Really? Oh, yeah. Somebody sends in a positive poll. And right away,

[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:39.860]
here's the first suggestion is some crap. This place sucks. I can't wait to leave. Well, get on

[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:48.880]
a greyhound bus. Get on a trailways. Okay? And head for a loser city or leisure city. What

[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:55.060]
tell his leisure city? It's down yonder by. I know it is. I know. Kind of a name is that for a place.

[00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.960]
Where do you live? Oh, leisure city. That was up almost two points. Wow. The best thing about living

[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:07.740]
in South Florida is blank. We got 380 votes. The weather, 120. Can there be any doubt? I don't live in

[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:16.900]
South Florida. 74. The near Roger show 66. The beach 37 37 say the beach. My family is here.

[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:24.120]
34. My family is not here. 15. Oh, the Everglades 11. Now what's what's the big deal with the Everglades?

[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:31.020]
What's great about that? It's nice. It's nice. What? It's nice nature. They got crocks and

[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:36.380]
Oh my god. Well, you don't like nature. So whatever. I don't like nature. That's not my

[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:40.600]
idea of nature. That's like all evil stuff. Beautiful area. It's like that movie. What's

[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:46.680]
the name of the movie? Ruins. Oh, okay. The diverse culture. Nine. The food. Six. The sports teams.

[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:55.640]
Five. The job opportunities. Three. And the shopping. None. The shopping. None. Zero. How do you

[00:34:55.640 --> 00:35:03.540]
like that? Fred and Vocus is the state wants to tax porn to help balance the budget. We should

[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:08.000]
have a protest. It would be a gas. Can you imagine some of the signs? Yeah. Be a real gas, Fred.

[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:18.420]
Good life. Oh my god. Wow. Brandencers. I believe it if you're single. When I'll completely. The

[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:22.280]
weather is no really bad. But the power has been flickering here all morning. It's Florida flicker

[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:27.860]
in the loot. How do you like that? Wow. The douse down four and a half points.

[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.820]
Yeah, somebody and his friends went out and got plastered after the consular last. Now, I guess

[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.980]
that's what you do after you go to a concert. You go out and get plowed. Sure. Generally speaking.

[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:43.020]
Well, not if it's on a weekday and you're a working person. Oh, what if it's on a weekday and you're

[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:50.600]
not a working person? Well, if you're a sleeping person, then you party on someone else is done. I see.

[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.600]
Oh, good. I sure hope so.

[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:59.080]
Dade City. Here's a really, really thank you, Branden, for this bizarre story.

[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:05.600]
It all started about 7 p.m. Tuesday, 30, said when the mother looked outside and saw her 19-year-old

[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:12.440]
son masturbating in the backyard. The mother yelled, the son Antoine L. Grandbury, 19, walked

[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.700]
around the front of the house on 13th Street in Dade City, rang the doorbell, according to Dade City

[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:21.380]
Police report. The mother answered began cursing and yelling at Grandbury who then punched his mother

[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:27.160]
in the face. Grandbury, who's listed as unemployed, was arrested on a domestic battery charge,

[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:35.380]
being held in the land-o-lakes jail in Louis $500 bail. Punch mom in the and the pus. How about that?

[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.460]
And why was he doing this deed in the backyard? I'm a little maybe the bastard who was full.

[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:46.280]
Maybe he doesn't have a bedroom. How about that? Or maybe he just enjoys the outdoors. Maybe he's

[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.880]
one of those nature people who we're just talking about. He was trying to get close to nature.

[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:56.020]
Sure. That's why they do that outside sometimes. Is it? You bet. So the City Commission is

[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.080]
I'm going to keep checking that Harold website because I'm sure nobody's going to come running

[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:04.200]
and there were any news on it. They don't even know we're on the year. In fact, I'm not so sure we

[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:10.300]
are to be honest with him. Now, nothing new. I'm going to keep checking that Harold website because I

[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:15.100]
know damn well that if something happens, the Harold will be right there with their four employees,

[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:24.020]
right? Right. No emails. Nothing new. NeilAtNeilRodgers.com. I think this is the day. This is the

[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:30.840]
turning point in our lives. Do you know what I mean by that? No. I don't either. Okay.

[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:37.340]
Well, today is Thursday that we got our 50% off a Neil deal at noon. We actually have one this

[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:41.120]
week and we got one for next week too. How do you like that? I read. Put that in your pipe and

[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:48.540]
smoke a Josh Friedman. You fat type of garbage. See, I'm getting suckered into this crap just like

[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.760]
the other people on the station. I'm starting to pay attention to them across the street, which up

[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:57.600]
until recently I ignored them. I don't care. But what do we care about them? I don't. They don't

[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.120]
even make a dent in our audience in midday. They never have it. They never will. They talk a big

[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:07.420]
game. But then again, so did Sid the kid. Now he's gone. All these guys who talk a big game. Oh,

[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:11.600]
yeah, I'm the greatest thing that ever happened to radio and I'm this and my mom. It old Rodgers and

[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:16.800]
old funny, Dutty and we're young and breathing and living and out of work out of work. Loser.

[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:24.640]
Loser and abuser written all of his forehead. So, Oish, Moises, I remember when Mayor Martinez

[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:29.080]
elected to 87 terms. Remember where Raoul Martinez wanted a punchhank and a push at highly

[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:34.840]
it at the racetrack? See, wanted a level highly racetrack and built condos for his corrupt friends.

[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:39.600]
If Alcott is determined to attack again as Dick Cheney says, maybe he can ask them to attack

[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:44.960]
Hylia, please. Now that's bad. There are probably some nice people in Hylia. Wouldn't surprise me if we

[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:50.940]
have some listeners in Hylia. Well, no, it would surprise me. But what do you think we have any

[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.280]
listeners in Hylia? A couple. What a two. I'm trying to remember if we ever get any emails from

[00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:03.020]
anybody, any chronics or whatever is in Hylia. I don't think so. Now it's just coming up very soon

[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:09.100]
on 11 o'clock and I'm looking to see if there's any emails I haven't been going through here yet.

[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:16.840]
What do you think the answer is? No. I mean, I've got a bunch of stuff here, but it's, you know,

[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:23.400]
bedtime stories. And these people have run either the signal is unlistenable and we have nobody

[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:29.760]
listening now or they just have nothing to say. Both. I was down 16 points. More but endey pressing.

[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:33.060]
Maybe they're still hungover from St. Paddy's Day, although it's drunk at Irishman.

[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.940]
Son of Shinin here, man, it's beautyous. It's absolutely beautiful.

[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:45.880]
I know your audience is mostly old folks is this chronic complainer, but how about the night life

[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:52.140]
or the women for the pool? Also, the landscape is the nicest in the world. What landscape? I don't know.

[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:59.260]
The place somebody who's never been north of a brown County, obviously, the landscape. I don't know

[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:05.120]
the life or the women. Okay, Adam, on their night life and the women. Always with a with a

[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:11.960]
hussy with a stoch as you would say. Gold guns and whiskey start buying now before the

[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:18.140]
dollars worthless as a bob. Okay. Gold guns and whiskey. Here's one from the fake fake

[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:23.340]
Fatso Rush Limbaugh. What I like most about living in South Florida is the low taxes. Can I

[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:27.540]
save even more if I move up there? Maybe we could be rumies. That would be a riot. Love Fatso.

[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:33.440]
Yeah. Keep them coming. Keep all these dumb idiotic things coming. Wow.

[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.120]
Show us cancel that they did lack of interest.

[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:48.220]
Where's the love? Where is it? I'm going to have to play that. All they care about right now is,

[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:54.800]
you know, AIG and college hoops. That's right. You got your record. You got your,

[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:59.220]
you know, nobody passed the brackets out whoever is supposed to be doing that here at the radio

[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:04.800]
station. I think today or tomorrow or something this week is the last chance for that. And so whoever

[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:10.220]
is in charge of that, I think it's supposed to be cope. Hasn't put anything in anyone's box that I know of.

[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.920]
Yeah. Well, why not? I don't know. How are you going to win some money? Did you win some money on this

[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:22.600]
once upon a time? Yeah. Two years ago. I got it. I think based on what? Based on common sense. They put

[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:32.780]
the rankings in everything right there. Go Gators. Well, I'm not this year. It's really said,

[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:39.200]
now I know why they're not going to buy you that car. Right. Because they never meant to. No,

[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:43.760]
you rip and tear and all the sports nerd stuff. Well, but if you've got a chance to make a

[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:49.680]
couple of easy bucks, yeah, what's your point? My point is more power to you. Oh, here you go. Watch

[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.700]
the Miami Commission meeting on the Marlins live here and it's got a link. I'm not going to why. I

[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.400]
got to do a radio show. You think I'm going to sit here and watch a watch a damn commission meeting?

[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:05.920]
Jerry says, could you add the women are hot, the men are hot to the pool. No, we already put women.

[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:12.540]
Jesus God. You want me to put the men on there for the female voters? No. Your gay friends? No.

[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:22.380]
And Horace is in I hate our mayor. That's it. Well, I wasn't highly and I hate he and he hates the

[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:27.480]
mayor. Okay. All right. They they have got nothing today. Boy, this is going to be today. I'm

[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:33.800]
going to want today. At least most days since we started the email thing, most days there's a

[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:38.740]
dribbling of drab and stuff that keeps going along to get us all the way to two o'clock dribbling

[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:46.700]
that's right. A dribbling of drab. Let's go play scrabble. My God. But today, wow, today's the day

[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:52.060]
like the music stopped. Oh, that's because that city commission meeting is going on. Yeah,

[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:55.460]
they're really all whipped up to a frenzy about that. I'm sure. Let's take a look at the herald at

[00:42:55.460 --> 00:43:01.340]
that pool. Okay. And see how it's going. Not that that's got anything to do with anything where

[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:04.980]
it's going to have any influence. It could be 100% negative and it's still what have no influence

[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:09.700]
because once these deals get cooked up behind the scenes and they promised this and they promised

[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:16.320]
that. Here we go. Let me click on this thing. Should elect the should the blah, blah, blah, blah,

[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:21.160]
here we go. Where is it? Don't tell me they took the pull off of there. Oh, yeah. View results.

[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:29.240]
Okay. View results. And it says should elected officials approve the stadium. Yes, we need new

[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:39.860]
stadium for the marlins 458 50% know it's fiscally irresponsible. 455 50% three votes apart.

[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:54.720]
How do you like that? Who the hell's happened? Oh, my God. 1056 and 560 WQ and the last

[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.180]
edition of the New York Roger show I'm positive with that. I don't think I'm coming back tomorrow for

[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:02.660]
more of this. Yeah. If it's going to be like this, we got three hours yet to go and we got nothing

[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:07.960]
from our vast audience out there. They have nothing to say about anything. It's like her. What?

[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:12.700]
You better come up. Yeah. I'm going to listen. During this break, you're going to get a text message.

[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:17.400]
Oh, all of a sudden I just came down with the relapse. My throat is scratchy and my ass is,

[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:21.180]
and you know something I never did do that. Joyce. And now the moment is passed.

[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:30.720]
It was just there was just enough pressure building within my balls. You know what I mean? Yeah.

[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:38.100]
And now I have the moment passed and that's it. Maybe during the break, I'll go in there and give it a shot.

[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.840]
I give it a try. There you go. You'll give it a little talent. Yeah. College squeal.

[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:48.140]
Rara. Just boom bot. Let's hope. This is the Neal Roger show.

[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.960]
You you you you you you you you you you you you. This is your brain.

[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.900]
Any questions? No.

[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:02.220]
How may I be helping you today? Hey, would you please be having a blooser, big

[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.240]
We are having a sale on cameras.

[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.540]
R-H-G-G-G-G.

[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.980]
We have had a lot of many flavors.

[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:12.880]
R-H-G-G-G-G-H-G-H-A-D-A.

[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.380]
Okay, I tell you everything.

[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.800]
I just can't make it out for the inside I'm thinking.

[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.200]
Yes, it's true.

[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.500]
We're the women in magazines.

[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.200]
It is only because they smell so bad ass.

[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.500]
You can name a group reactions of a group

[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.020]
but we don't want to drink out of it.

[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.080]
We feel like our food.

[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.940]
R-H-G-G-G-G-G.

[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:59.920]
R-H-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G

[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.580]
a compact grid looking at th-impractive caps but getting тестed on a

[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:59.900]
table, a simple fed up Utah mitten getting US United States

[00:46:59.900 --> 00:46:59.900]

[00:46:59.900 --> 00:46:59.900]

[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.920]
care about at the moment you don't care how sick you're going to make yourself afterwards

[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.200]
it's what people do all the time.

[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:05.560]
Really?

[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:10.300]
People have a different drug of choice or sometimes several drugs of choice and they do

[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:10.960]
it with all of them.

[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.600]
I'll be danged.

[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:13.200]
So there you go.

[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.880]
I wonder how long your liver holds out when I, you know, he's doing that over and over again.

[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.240]
Not long.

[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.140]
Oh good.

[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:22.940]
Okay, here's an email from Zisco who I thought was our friend but obviously is not.

[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:25.580]
He, you know, he, he vacillates.

[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:25.800]
Really?

[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:26.880]
He turns out.

[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.380]
Sounds like you're going to have to take some calls today.

[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:29.100]
I'm your friend.

[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.660]
Not funny.

[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.080]
Let, let me say this to you, okay?

[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:40.100]
The chances of my taking calls today of my succumbing to the lack of response by the

[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.060]
audience to taking calls, there's no chance.

[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:48.240]
In fact, that should be a good warning to all you potential e-mailers, regular, chronic

[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:53.380]
and occasional that we need some input today because otherwise, you know, there's that

[00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:55.180]
temptation to just, you know, go to the phone.

[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:59.780]
If you know how long it's been since I've even turned that phone monitor on, I don't

[00:47:59.780 --> 00:47:59.900]
know.

[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.540]
Long time, long time, weeks.

[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:04.660]
Am I missing it?

[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.100]
No.

[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.720]
By the way, Carolina won last night.

[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.220]
I think the Panthers are going to like a boy.

[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.320]
It's a typical late season swoon they're going and do now.

[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.780]
Just when they gave it that playoff tease, now it looks like, oh, I don't think so.

[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.800]
I'm not to, you know, they got 12 games to go, I guess.

[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:25.720]
And the Leafs are in the town tonight to make the fake beliefs, but wouldn't it be something

[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:29.400]
if Toronto kicked the cramp out of the Panthers tonight, just like that miraculous come

[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:34.540]
from behind, shoot out victory in Tampa, the other than that improbable win in Tampa?

[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:38.300]
Yeah, Carolina 4 and, um, whatever.

[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:40.400]
New Jersey, New Jersey 2.

[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.760]
Saw a little bit of your friend, Rimmer on your last night.

[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:45.620]
He's no Randy Molor.

[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:46.220]
I'll tell you that.

[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.220]
But that who is?

[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.140]
Here's the way the pool shapes up right now as we speak.

[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:52.840]
And you haven't added the nightlife.

[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:54.980]
I thought I did.

[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:56.840]
I don't see it.

[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:58.380]
Well, do you see it?

[00:48:58.520 --> 00:48:58.680]
No.

[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.040]
If you see it, point me in the right direction.

[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:02.580]
There you, over there.

[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:03.340]
Yeah.

[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.440]
Oh, yeah, there's some nightlife.

[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:08.040]
There's some day life, some gay life.

[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:09.520]
Where's a lot of that here, I'll tell you.

[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:10.780]
Wow.

[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:15.800]
And the women, see, I used to think people made that up.

[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.520]
But it's true that Canadian women, I mean, there's a lot of beautiful women here.

[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:21.060]
Don't get me wrong.

[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:26.440]
But the middle-aged and older women, they're an awful lot of really daiki women.

[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.240]
And you want to know why?

[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:27.660]
Why?

[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.140]
Because they're probably daics.

[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:30.380]
Coincidence?

[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:31.340]
No.

[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.880]
But they're really are.

[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.320]
They're a lot of very butch-daiki women in Canada.

[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.260]
It's kind of a British thing, I guess.

[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.160]
They can't cut that damn umbilical cord.

[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.520]
The best thing about living in South Florida is the weather 137.

[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.900]
Can there be any doubt about it?

[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.560]
I don't live in South Florida 80.

[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.420]
The neo-rodger shows 73.

[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:52.080]
On those days, when the signal, when the wind is blown in the right direction, we can hear the signal.

[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:57.980]
The best thing about living in South Florida is my family is here, 38th, the beach 38th.

[00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:59.540]
My family isn't here, 16th.

[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.680]
The Everglades 11, I still don't understand that.

[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:08.680]
That's not nature, that's wilderness, that's like, you know, you want to get lost in the Everglades?

[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:09.920]
No, not really.

[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:11.780]
You want to go out there with the Crocs?

[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.100]
I think it's a croc, yeah.

[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:17.400]
The diverse culture, nine, the food six, the diverse culture, see, that's another fantasy.

[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:20.040]
I don't want to let turn negative on this very positive pull.

[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.680]
The diverse culture is nonsense.

[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:27.940]
You've got Hispanics, Anglos and Dark folks, and that's it.

[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.940]
Hey, don't leave the Jews out, anti-Sumite.

[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:36.780]
Anglos, yeah.

[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.940]
We, we had lumped in crackers, white folks.

[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:46.120]
The food six, the sports teams five, all like the Marlins, we've got to get that stadium for the Marlins.

[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:48.040]
And what are we going to do about D-4?

[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.540]
What's happened to D-4, Neil?

[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:51.060]
Oh, I got to think about D-4 in a second.

[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:51.820]
A joke.

[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:57.460]
The job opportunities for the women's tree, the landscape one, the landscape, what does that mean?

[00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:01.440]
The landscape, all those melalucatries that are all like, yeah, I don't know what that means.

[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:02.140]
Huh?

[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.240]
I don't know what that means.

[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:08.360]
All those chopped up melalucatries that are like, taking up a lot of space and empty lots that are all the,

[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.680]
the bark is peeled off and just, and the shopping none.

[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.420]
I guess our crowd don't shop at the sore grass.

[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:17.780]
What was that other mall that they were raving about the other day where all the,

[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.200]
people in Perverts go, what was it?

[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:20.760]
Dolphin mall?

[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.280]
Dolphin mall, that's the one, remember that?

[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:22.740]
Yeah.

[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.060]
The Dolphin mall.

[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.920]
Well, what's the big cynist with the Dolphin mall?

[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:27.820]
Maybe somebody can explain it.

[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:30.180]
And by the way, I was right about no listeners in Hylia.

[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.020]
You think I've had one email, for instance, I made that comment.

[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.120]
That was like half an hour ago.

[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:34.620]
No.

[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:37.160]
And we had one email from anybody in Hylia?

[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.520]
No, we don't have anybody there.

[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:40.300]
Oh, but a whole bunch of emails now.

[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:43.100]
Wow.

[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:48.940]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, city group plans to spend $10 million on new offices.

[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.880]
We know that you don't have to send me the newspaper, okay?

[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:57.620]
Joe says next time, please use your tongue to put in the light bulb socket to test if the power is completely off.

[00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:58.420]
Thank you, Joe.

[00:51:58.500 --> 00:51:59.340]
Oh, this is from Joe Bell.

[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.220]
And I believe it.

[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.520]
Don't you believe it?

[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:03.960]
Yeah.

[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.460]
I believe it.

[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:07.260]
What a douchebox.

[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.540]
Oh, Cuban George has got a real good reason.

[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:15.860]
You see this, this is reverse psychology.

[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.140]
He said the reason nobody's involved with the show days,

[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.100]
because it's a crappy day.

[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:19.760]
It's raining, etc.

[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:21.040]
Well, guess what?

[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.040]
That would seem to me would be just the opposite.

[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:24.580]
This is a beautiful sunny day.

[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:28.000]
And nice people would be, you know, living and breathing people would be out.

[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:29.980]
And doing stuff.

[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.520]
Pete says, I voted yes for the new ballpark, because I don't live there.

[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:40.220]
The internet is a great thank God for Al Gore for inventing it and inventing global warming.

[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.000]
Bye, bye, bye.

[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:41.780]
He invented both.

[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:44.140]
My God.

[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.620]
Now there's all kinds of stuff coming in.

[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:46.300]
You want to know why?

[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:47.260]
Why?

[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.600]
Because I threatened to take calls.

[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.640]
There's this guy said some stupid thing about taking calls.

[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:53.960]
Here's one says, all on.

[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:55.700]
You'll just want to say I'm one of your two highly listeners.

[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:58.140]
I also wanted two people in high league and speak English.

[00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:58.640]
Perfect.

[00:52:58.840 --> 00:52:59.400]
I love the show.

[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.220]
Eric, the highly a surveyor.

[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:03.020]
PS, my job keeps cutting hours.

[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.700]
Maybe I should start dealing drugs or killing for cash.

[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.420]
Yo, George need, need hash just holla.

[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.760]
He's got the cash if you need the hash or however that goes.

[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.020]
Oh my God.

[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:22.220]
What is this all about?

[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:24.020]
About the first race of Gulf Stream today.

[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.800]
That's tomorrow's our pick up pony thing.

[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:26.660]
And you know something.

[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.940]
I don't have anything on that either from what's the name Steve Sloan?

[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.860]
I'm sure you'll get no entries.

[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:32.620]
You're sure.

[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:33.280]
You know what?

[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:34.160]
You're sure.

[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.120]
Yeah, I'm sure you're not sure.

[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:39.960]
I'll call me.

[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:41.720]
I found the best nuts in the history of nuts.

[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:43.900]
Blue diamonds, soy and wasabi almonds.

[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:48.040]
I know you prefer sweet stuff, but give these a try if you see them really good.

[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:48.440]
Schmidt.

[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:49.740]
How do you like that?

[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.640]
Oh, by the way, guess where I'm going at two o'clock.

[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:52.540]
What?

[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:52.760]
Mine?

[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:53.420]
Yeah.

[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:57.040]
And you want to know why you want to?

[00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:57.800]
I want to.

[00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:58.740]
I feel like it.

[00:53:58.740 --> 00:53:59.700]
I'm in the mood for it.

[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.880]
And somebody I know is going to be sleeping off his hangover all day to day.

[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.140]
Wow.

[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:05.380]
That's really something.

[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.880]
What time was that message I got?

[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:10.020]
10.40 in the morning, way before rising time.

[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:12.780]
Wasted.

[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:17.580]
Because this is what you do after you go to the Britney Spears concert with your friends

[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:22.700]
you go out and you just drink and drink and booze it up until you just stagger back home

[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.700]
until you can barely remember where the hell you live.

[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.520]
Unfortunately, he remembered.

[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:29.860]
Let's see.

[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:33.480]
Here's one that says last I checked and correct me if I'm wrong.

[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:34.540]
We live in a democracy.

[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:39.100]
Why then is this stating not put up to a vote by the people to decide because they know

[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:40.020]
they'd get their ass kicked?

[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.040]
Who's making money on this deal?

[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.040]
Who's getting a smear?

[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:43.960]
That's the question.

[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:45.020]
Rosemary.

[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.940]
Neil, why would you think we lived in a one?

[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.020]
Yo, you would think we live in a third world country.

[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:52.760]
What do you do, honey?

[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:53.380]
You do.

[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:58.720]
One more thing my husband works as a retail manager and if he doesn't meet the goals

[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.220]
of the year, guess what?

[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.240]
He gets no bonus.

[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.400]
Maybe he should work for AIG.

[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:09.180]
I don't know why everybody's so surprised that there's all this corruption.

[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:10.160]
Everybody's a big crook.

[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:14.560]
Why they're surprised at that because they're stupid and if they offered you a bonus like

[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:17.360]
a million bucks or 1.7 million something like that, what would you say?

[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:18.680]
Oh, no, I don't want to take that.

[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:19.820]
The company lost money.

[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:20.800]
Oh, no, I don't deserve it.

[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.720]
Yeah, no, I don't want it.

[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:26.880]
I mean, I'm not justifying this rape of the public in this grotesque insanity, but nevertheless,

[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:31.020]
if somebody offers most people a chance to be dishonest and to take a bunch of crap,

[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:32.140]
they'll take the crap.

[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:35.080]
This is the most disgusting program.

[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.580]
I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:39.560]
That's my opinion.

[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:40.480]
I'm Mike Disney.

[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.220]
What a guy hears a new dance.

[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:45.780]
Some people call the barn dance.

[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.780]
I call it a dirty square dance.

[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:55.060]
Up with the beddy go down with the pants in with the bigger everybody dance.

[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:57.260]
Okay.

[00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:58.700]
Yeah.

[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.220]
I was gonna say.

[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:07.200]
Well, I guess I hit the button.

[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:07.500]
Did you?

[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:08.060]
No.

[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.080]
Oh, let me hit it again.

[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:10.720]
It was to be sure.

[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.400]
Hit it again, Sam.

[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:12.280]
Oh.

[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:14.480]
Well, I forgot that that was in there.

[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:15.500]
I thought it was amusing.

[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:17.040]
I thought it was very, it is amusing.

[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:17.420]
Right.

[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.780]
We can't talk about chickens anymore.

[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:19.280]
No.

[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.560]
We just can't play that.

[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:21.240]
Well, that was bad.

[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:23.340]
But here's something you, I'm glad that I had end day.

[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:23.940]
You want to know why?

[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:24.380]
Why?

[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.540]
I've got the entries from Steve Sloan.

[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:30.000]
Seven horse field, 10,000 claimer, six for a long, tomorrow, Gulf Stream race two.

[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:33.540]
And the five horse, when you hear the name of this horse, you are gonna plots.

[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:35.800]
Okay.

[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:36.820]
Joyce, Joyce.

[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:37.880]
Say.

[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:38.460]
What?

[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:39.660]
Oh, no, rejoice, Royce.

[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.380]
Oh, okay.

[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:41.820]
Rejoice, Royce.

[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:44.840]
Is that incredible or what?

[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:45.600]
Is that an omen?

[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:46.080]
Yeah.

[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:46.440]
Maybe.

[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.360]
And this horse has got a legitimate shot in here.

[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:54.980]
I believe turning back from a mile to six for longs.

[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:56.780]
And these are four year olds.

[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:57.920]
And up, this is the only six year old.

[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.160]
These are horses which have never won two races.

[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:09.520]
And this one had a pretty good second at Gulf Stream back on February 13th.

[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:11.660]
Who's D. Coa?

[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:13.500]
That must be a kind of A. Bar Coa.

[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:15.160]
Why do these jockeys?

[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.540]
I don't know who the hell they are.

[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:20.820]
That kid Rick, Kendri, whatever his name was, Castillo last week, he gave that seven horse

[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:21.600]
a really good ride.

[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:22.740]
He gave it a hell of a shot.

[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:25.280]
Just came up short to the five.

[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:25.860]
What a shame.

[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:27.560]
Rejoice, Royce.

[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:28.140]
Joyce.

[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:30.860]
How do you like that?

[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:35.760]
Yeah.

[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:36.160]
What do you think?

[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.260]
Well, I mean, I got a, I got a, I can't put based on the name.

[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:44.600]
Am I gonna wager somebody's a mythical $50 based on the name of the horse?

[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:44.980]
Maybe.

[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:45.700]
Yeah.

[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.280]
You would.

[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:48.240]
Yeah.

[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.420]
That's not a good name.

[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:49.780]
I don't know any better.

[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:51.060]
What else to choose?

[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:52.200]
Well, I don't know what to do.

[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:53.480]
You don't know about the speed ratings.

[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:56.860]
I don't know about the, that's why you're doing this and not me.

[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:57.820]
Well, what do I know?

[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:58.600]
What's all the vinyl?

[00:57:58.760 --> 00:57:59.620]
More than me.

[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.300]
More than me.

[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.940]
I mean, to those quarter horses, that's what I would have been on a record.

[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:03.800]
There you go.

[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:05.160]
Back up better, buck, and a quarter.

[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.680]
That was down 46 point.

[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.120]
Well, thanks to Zisco.

[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:11.920]
Zisco sent me a follow-up email.

[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:12.400]
He's right.

[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:17.920]
He said that because he, we're worried about how it's in here somewhere.

[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.480]
I got a pile of crap all of a sudden.

[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:20.200]
And he wanted to why?

[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:21.900]
He said, my reverse psychology worked.

[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.220]
Fear of calls got you your emails.

[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:24.860]
I guess I'm the best friend you have.

[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:25.240]
You're welcome.

[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.220]
Thank you, Zisco.

[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:27.080]
Thank you, Zman.

[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:31.960]
Well, I, man, you know, what's that guy's name Charles, whatever's name is?

[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:32.640]
The news guy?

[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.080]
Charles Dimeson.

[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.700]
No, whatever his name is.

[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:36.180]
Charles Dimeson.

[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:36.460]
That's not guy.

[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:38.400]
Such an ass sucking fool, man.

[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:39.200]
He's got a good voice.

[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:40.200]
I mean, he's a good news guy.

[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:44.720]
But other than that, just nauseating, revolting.

[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:49.980]
Well, I, man, I mean, you know, what's the point of that?

[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.440]
Here's one from Chef Sparky, who's across the street, by the way.

[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:57.800]
And he'll have been listening a little to the labaster show to see what the fuss is all about.

[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:02.200]
From what I can gather, he basically is doing a Paul and Ron type act in the afternoon.

[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.860]
He blends in some sports, but even in the interviews with athletes,

[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:07.680]
the talk is generally anything but sports.

[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:11.400]
He's definitely his entertaining as I found myself laughing out loud more than once.

[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.620]
Yeah, this is from across the street.

[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:13.180]
Yeah.

[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:17.400]
However, my original critique of that show was that the bastards and the two gods sound like

[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.200]
why need little bit school kids?

[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.120]
And this is what I can't tolerate for too long.

[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:25.120]
This kind of like George free mad dog that I'm expand his repertoire.

[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.520]
It says, yeah, free the mad dog.

[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:33.660]
Let's have everybody like the Sri Lankans, the Tamil tiger opponents.

[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:34.900]
I don't know.

[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:40.060]
I can't figure out the Tamil tigers are a bunch of lunatic terrorists who invented the whole suicide bombing concept.

[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:45.020]
And like the article said yesterday, they've killed more people with suicide bombs than Al-Qaeda

[00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:49.280]
and Hamas and all the other terrorist organizations combined the Tamil tigers.

[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.080]
So that's why we head on Monday here.

[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:55.660]
40,000 Sri Lankans demonstrating in the streets, closing down streets blocking off traffic,

[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:56.960]
being a general pain in the ass.

[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.380]
What the hell are we going to do about it?

[00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:02.380]
Everybody wants somebody to take care of their grievances, their problems.

[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.620]
What are we going to do about it?

[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.720]
Are you going to do something about it about the Tamil tigers?

[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.140]
Yeah, I'm going to smoke a bowl.

[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.360]
Yeah, well, you do that about anything.

[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.040]
That generally seems to solve the problem.

[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.280]
So like going out and getting plastered after the Britney Spears concert.

[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:16.880]
Same thing.

[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.240]
I mean, that's probably why I'm still alive.

[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.280]
That's I was just never a big drinker.

[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.780]
You know, I was just never a big get blitzed and right.

[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.040]
Stagger around and try to find my way home.

[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:33.080]
I think of that guy that lived right next door to me.

[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.560]
That I told you used to the drug dealer.

[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:37.860]
Up there on sunrise.

[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.040]
Yeah, he used to live right next door to me.

[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:41.960]
He would come staggering.

[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:45.520]
He would aim the key to his front door at the lock.

[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:46.740]
He would aim it.

[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.160]
And then he would take about a half a dozen like aim before he could finally stick it in there.

[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.560]
And the key to well, let's see.

[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.800]
Should like that officials approved the stadium is still 50, 50.

[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.900]
495 say, oh, yeah, we need a new statement for the Marlins.

[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:02.760]
No, it's physically irresponsible.

[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.360]
Oh, 496.

[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:09.220]
But it's still 50, 50 out of the first 991 votes on the Harold website.

[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.000]
Should elected officials approve the stadium?

[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.300]
No, F and way, man.

[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.740]
Commission prepares to vote on Marlins.

[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:20.840]
I keep checking this thing because I'm sure that even though we're supposed to be the big hot shot sports station.

[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:24.740]
That nobody from our, you know, sports department, which is the whole rest of the building.

[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.740]
Is going to come running and giving us any dope.

[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.060]
They never do.

[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.100]
Remember when Nick Sabin left town and high-tailed it off to Alabama.

[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:38.040]
And I was the one that found out because I went online on the Harold website of the Sun Central.

[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:38.860]
I was the one that found out.

[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.760]
And the rest of the building, oh, where did Neil get that?

[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.200]
Where did Neil get that?

[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.160]
Oh, geez.

[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.680]
Or one wants that left.

[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.560]
Whatever the hell it was.

[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:48.080]
Just go online and get some information.

[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:48.660]
That's all.

[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.060]
Or depend on the QAM news department.

[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:58.340]
I still can't, I can't get over that when we were at the Pax, NIO D.

[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.280]
And I turned on the station.

[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.360]
And it was the top of the hour.

[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.040]
I was thinking maybe they were going to do some real news.

[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:07.520]
And they did have what they called news, but it was a sports update.

[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.400]
Yeah, would you expect it?

[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.800]
And I thought to myself, these people are sick.

[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.780]
It was like today of 9-11, which I think was 9-11.

[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.120]
Wasn't it 2001, 9-11 and Geltie's on it?

[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:21.420]
Oh, what are we going to talk about buildings falling down?

[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:22.680]
Well, what's that bit?

[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.920]
Chicken and Quilt tell you, whatever that bit is where Geltie says,

[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:27.800]
what are we going to talk about?

[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.300]
Building, we're here to talk about sports.

[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.660]
You know the one I'm talking about?

[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:32.640]
Yes, I do. He'll tell us.

[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:36.800]
And that was his real take on a Geltie, being the simple to that he is.

[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.760]
What are we going to say?

[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.020]
I mean, he's going to be going down.

[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:40.400]
What?

[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.220]
Not just his take on it.

[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:46.140]
No, but he's the one that was dumb enough to say it on the ear.

[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:46.580]
Right.

[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:52.040]
Boka peets is one of your most loyal listeners who grew up in highly.

[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:52.780]
Does that count?

[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.840]
No, thanks to anyway, Pete, but no, highly a peet.

[01:02:58.780 --> 01:02:59.800]
He's in Boka now.

[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:02.200]
Well, he's hitting all the high spots.

[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.060]
You know, people would always ask me, have you gone to such and such a restaurant in Boka?

[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.240]
I don't think I've ever really, I mean, I've driven through Boka, of course.

[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:12.680]
But I don't think I've ever been in Boka like per se, you know what I mean?

[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:13.500]
Yeah.

[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:14.560]
Like hung out.

[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:15.280]
Yeah.

[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.380]
Well, certainly never went to any restaurant there.

[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:20.680]
Would you go, would you drive to Boka to go to a restaurant?

[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:21.260]
I have.

[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.500]
And what restaurant was that?

[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:25.560]
In the town center, I forget which one it was.

[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.620]
What the name of it was, it was a while ago.

[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:30.720]
And I'll be there.

[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:31.620]
Went to a concert there.

[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.000]
Also a while ago.

[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.100]
My, is near park.

[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:34.500]
Yep.

[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:35.820]
Really?

[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.800]
Yeah, I'm not going to do it again because soon as he's written, he spears.

[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:39.000]
No.

[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.480]
Did you go about and get plastered afterward and just, you know, crawl on your, during?

[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:42.660]
What?

[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:43.360]
During the concert.

[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.340]
I got plastered.

[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:44.580]
No.

[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.140]
How do you do that?

[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.080]
Well, you bring a cooler full of beer and then you drink it.

[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.240]
And they'd like to do that?

[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:51.060]
Yeah.

[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.580]
But then they make everyone leave right after the concert.

[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:56.620]
So it's like, dude, I just got so they can puke outside.

[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.880]
So they can clean up for the all the antiseptic, antiseptic blue noses the next day.

[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:10.320]
So in other words, you're saying that those of us who are not into getting drunk and puke in our guts on our antiseptic blue noses,

[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.940]
that's the ass club you are.

[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:12.700]
They're butt plugs.

[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:13.500]
That's me.

[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.200]
I'm a butt plug.

[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.080]
I'm a party pooper.

[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.040]
Remember Mr. Poopers?

[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:18.640]
Yep.

[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.000]
And there's always Anderson.

[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:20.620]
Kaka.

[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:21.440]
Poop.

[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.200]
Oh, yeah.

[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.500]
With Obama's present, now you can liberal up what you can say and play on the radio.

[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.480]
Says some idiot.

[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.340]
Yeah, right then.

[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:32.040]
You're more on.

[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.780]
With Joyce at the helm of this company, that is never going to happen.

[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.660]
Yeah, I already got your fake time jicke.

[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.940]
I already got your email the first time.

[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.540]
No need to repeat, okay?

[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.320]
Little Tommy, fake little Tommy.

[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:46.480]
No need to repeat.

[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.980]
That's one thing about these emails.

[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.880]
If I don't read it right away the first time.

[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:53.120]
Oh, if I send it two or three more times, I'm sure I'll read it right away.

[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:53.780]
Oh, Neil!

[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:55.820]
Nothing to Neil Rogers.

[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:56.240]
Yeah.

[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.440]
I'm just going to put it to you.

[01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.060]
Later.

[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.540]
560 Q-A-A-Bank for calling.

[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:03.400]
How old?

[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.960]
I'm Tommy from Tai Tami.

[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.860]
Saying for the best Thai food and the best service.

[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.760]
As long as you're not black, come on down to Tai Tami or some fish.

[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:13.340]
We ain't all like black people.

[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:14.480]
Stay on tip well.

[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:17.300]
Besides, why black people want to eat Thai food anyway?

[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.320]
We're not have fried chicken on the menu.

[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.280]
Oh wait, I forget.

[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.920]
We have spare ribs.

[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.220]
Look, Shane, I talk.

[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.480]
What are spare ribs on menu?

[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:26.240]
It's a battle.

[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:29.940]
So, if you're not black, come on down to Tai Tami.

[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.400]
Come to think of it.

[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:32.940]
Those damn gay people.

[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.360]
We ain't not like them either.

[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.460]
Should they keep food?

[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.660]
But they talk too loud with funny lists.

[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:38.900]
They stop all the customers.

[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:39.640]
No come back.

[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.720]
So, no gay, no black.

[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.160]
And while we're at it, ladden people.

[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.260]
You make reservation for 715.

[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.660]
Don't show up at 820 and expect your table.

[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.200]
We give to someone else already.

[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.100]
Ladden people are always late.

[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.920]
No black, no gay, no ladden in Tai Tami.

[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:57.880]
And Jewish people, you start bickering all of Bill.

[01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:58.940]
Who cares who have what?

[01:05:59.220 --> 01:05:59.940]
Pay with an angle.

[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:00.780]
Set it outside.

[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:03.660]
Take 45 minutes to try to divide up Bill.

[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.100]
We ain't all while you hear.

[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.400]
No Jew, no black, no black, no Cuban.

[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.560]
And white people, you think you better than everybody else.

[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.680]
Come play too much if we don't kiss your ass.

[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:13.860]
You'll not come back.

[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.860]
No white, no black, no Jew, no ladden or snow gays.

[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.540]
Everybody else for the best Thai food.

[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.060]
Come on down to Tai Tami on the beach.

[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.280]
Hurry before we have to close.

[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.000]
And no smelly old Chinese money, either.

[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:28.360]
That was down 73 points.

[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:29.160]
Oh, that's not good.

[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.240]
What happened to the Obama bounce?

[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.080]
Where is Maria B.

[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:31.840]
Well, we need her, huh?

[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.380]
And you know who's really also conspicuous by the rapsons today?

[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:35.900]
Who?

[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.000]
I wonder if this is just because she said the kid got canned.

[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:43.780]
Fake Barry Jackass, the fake Greg Budell, the fake this one and that one.

[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:45.720]
The only faker we've got is the fake Tom Jicke.

[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.780]
Who I know is a different person.

[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.240]
Okay.

[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.800]
CJ says, just wanted to write and tell you those Chris Matthew bits are hilarious.

[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.380]
I'm going to keep the rest of this email simple.

[01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:01.520]
You rock, George rocks, Clarence, girl, parent, health, the number one show on the station.

[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:05.560]
All the other yuppies that bash you in George can suck a fart out of a pig's ass.

[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:06.920]
Can we say that?

[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:08.640]
I just did.

[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:09.260]
Yeah.

[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:10.260]
What's wrong with that?

[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.340]
Here's another thing I can say.

[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:13.080]
Yeah, guilty pants.

[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.060]
Oh, guilty pants.

[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:15.420]
Okay.

[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:18.020]
It says, been a fan 14 years since high school.

[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.220]
Thanks for all the last Uncle Leo.

[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:20.460]
Gelly pants.

[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:21.160]
Jess.

[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:22.340]
Wow.

[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:24.260]
Gelly.

[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.280]
Gelly and Mish.

[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.100]
Oh, two different words, Gelly pants.

[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.880]
I ain't got anybody to tell me.

[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.180]
I'm not a whop-whop-whop-whop.

[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.640]
I say put them all on steroids.

[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:37.300]
Yeah.

[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.600]
It makes them big and sweaty.

[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:40.500]
Mmm.

[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:46.080]
I know I speak on behalf of all sport halls by saying the sweatier, the better.

[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:47.240]
Oh, wow.

[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.120]
It sure is death and carnage in the Middle East.

[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.120]
And I'm a Jew, but who cares?

[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:54.480]
It's not a sports related matter.

[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.140]
Right clearance here.

[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:01.680]
And to stand being a 15-a-vice re-enign 11, I'm proud to say that I was right here.

[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:02.640]
I'm the air.

[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:05.640]
Keepin' all of you subtated under her weekends.

[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.260]
Besides what that was happenin' with bearing bonds as a shame.

[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.940]
Even wasting what happened to ward bonds.

[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.640]
We'll get ridin' the US bonds.

[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.240]
Nier ain't no James Bond.

[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:18.000]
Well, in his face can you some bad dough.

[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.200]
How's Cam no good and called this show?

[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:20.780]
Huh?

[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.400]
I'm married, you know.

[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:25.420]
Despite my love-hate relationship with Mo.

[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.020]
For Mo.

[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.120]
At least he ain't got no hungry mouths to feed.

[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:32.780]
Put thing his family ain't got nothin' to do with him.

[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:33.440]
With you?

[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.280]
Well, I don't blame his wife for leaving.

[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:37.940]
I believe him too.

[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:39.260]
And you know him, I'm outta thing.

[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.160]
Oh, right.

[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.160]
Knock it off, buster.

[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:41.780]
Sonny.

[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:42.800]
Never mind, nut.

[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.820]
I don't like nobody making fun of my family, see?

[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:46.760]
Oh, yeah.

[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.220]
How do you keep all those people out of the zoo?

[01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:50.680]
What are you?

[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:52.920]
And I'm outta thing.

[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:54.140]
Oh no.

[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:54.820]
Huh?

[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:56.260]
You know what?

[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:57.440]
It's happening again.

[01:08:57.940 --> 01:08:58.140]
What?

[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:00.260]
Every time I get excited.

[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:03.100]
It's like the Hulk, you know.

[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.540]
What is it?

[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:06.900]
It's Mr. Pillow Pans.

[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:07.800]
Ow.

[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:10.280]
Do I hate you, Mr. Pillow Pans?

[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:10.680]
Whoop!

[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:11.380]
You know what?

[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.020]
You know what it is?

[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:14.800]
Stop it.

[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:15.580]
You know what?

[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.620]
You better get outta here.

[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.640]
I know.

[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.460]
That was tough now.

[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.400]
It's time for me to walk away slowly.

[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:26.620]
And very steadily.

[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.380]
Very sad.

[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:30.320]
The doors.

[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.560]
You know what's how nobody seems to pick him up in the local market.

[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.860]
That's because he's doing a big high-payed show on Sirius XM, whatever it is.

[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:38.500]
That's right.

[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:39.420]
Before they shut down.

[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:43.200]
Here's one from Steve from Parkland now in Las Vegas.

[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.560]
Dear Uncle Neil, I live in Las Vegas to listen to you with George's often as I can.

[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.740]
The show is still great, but listen and still listen to Big Head in the morning.

[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:51.380]
I'm the one.

[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.660]
And Mad Dog, but the other shows are unlistenable.

[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.700]
How do you like that?

[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:55.600]
Hmm.

[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.700]
This jolly Joe must be a real ass clown.

[01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:00.400]
He doesn't say clown, but I did because I...

[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.980]
I love the Friday Gulf Stream picks.

[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:05.480]
I run right down to the sportsbook to plunge.

[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.300]
It's March Sadness around this place with all the big casino companies going broke.

[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.840]
I'm glad I took your advice and got the allotted gods waiting room.

[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.860]
I miss hearing Fat Hank.

[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:17.000]
In closing, great job getting rid of Moe.

[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.780]
It was your best work since getting rid of Joey.

[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.660]
I think you're going to be the one of them.

[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:21.640]
What is that supposed to mean?

[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.560]
I got rid of Moe.

[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.900]
Hey, Mad Dog, I'll take the credit for it.

[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.320]
Okay, I got rid of Moe and Joey.

[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:28.460]
The hell does that mean?

[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.160]
But anyway, thanks to Steve.

[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:31.460]
Plunge your guts out.

[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:32.820]
Yeah, they're really hurting in Vegas.

[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.080]
So they say, and that what they say?

[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:35.960]
Yeah.

[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:37.220]
For certain.

[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:39.060]
They're hurting for certain.

[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.140]
Well, you know, when I can go right up the road to a woodbine,

[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:46.740]
why the hell should I get on a plane and slap all the way out there four or five hours to Vegas?

[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:48.840]
Huh?

[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:49.720]
Yeah.

[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:53.540]
Here's one from another Jorge.

[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.240]
Well, we sure got a lot of Jorge's out there.

[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:55.600]
Just.

[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:00.600]
It seems to be an incredibly common name among your people.

[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:01.140]
It is.

[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.380]
Is it?

[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:02.860]
Yes.

[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:04.720]
Neil, I have an idea.

[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:07.160]
You need to diversify your show by any more sidekicks.

[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:09.320]
You represent the whiteies Jews in a homo.

[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.120]
Jorge represents the Spics.

[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:15.820]
How about having the Chinese lady who doesn't speak English from the suracross the street to represent the Asian people

[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.000]
and adding storm cat for the dark skin folks?

[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.980]
Yeah, today's storm cats on this show be a cold day in purgatory.

[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:21.600]
Let me tell you.

[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:25.720]
Maybe you can even give footy a chance to enhance your show just an idea.

[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:26.240]
Right.

[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:32.100]
PSTL, Jorge, he has less than an hour left to fill the brackets because the NCAA turnies first came in around noon.

[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:32.360]
Too late.

[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:34.920]
Too late while you did it?

[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.880]
No, midnight last night was the deadline.

[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.600]
Oh.

[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:40.460]
Was it really?

[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:40.820]
Yep.

[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.460]
How do you know that?

[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.860]
Because I read you pretty sports intensive today.

[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:50.540]
Yes, I am.

[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:50.880]
Yes, hoops.

[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:51.620]
That's right.

[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:52.720]
College hoops, baby.

[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.020]
Ask me if I care about college hoops.

[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:55.700]
Ask me.

[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:56.180]
No.

[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.320]
Oh, you're so negative right?

[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:01.020]
You're so, yeah, I just don't give a crap.

[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:01.680]
Not interested.

[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.120]
Not going to pretend to be interested.

[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:06.700]
And I'm not going to make enough money betting on some stupid basketball games.

[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:09.300]
467 votes on the pool.

[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:12.720]
The best thing about living in South Florida is the weather, 151.

[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:15.880]
The shopping, by the way, and the nightlife both have zero.

[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:18.440]
How do you like that?

[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.960]
Saw all these people saying, oh, you got to put the nightlife on there.

[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:21.280]
Yeah.

[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.100]
Well, we did.

[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.280]
It has no votes.

[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:25.220]
Neither is the shopping none.

[01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:33.100]
Even at Westland Mall, even at J.C. pennies, where they do the lyricaly-crague totals.

[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:33.220]
The

[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:34.020]
totap in the tearroom.

[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:37.440]
The weather, 152.

[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.860]
I don't live in South Florida, 85.

[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:40.660]
The Neal Rogers Show, 85.

[01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:42.460]
My family is here, 42.

[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:43.800]
The beach, 42.

[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.560]
My family isn't here, 16.

[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.520]
The Everglades, 12.

[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:49.500]
The diverse culture, 10.

[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:50.140]
Oh, yeah.

[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.120]
The women's seven.

[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.120]
The sports team, 6.

[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.040]
The food, 6.

[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.400]
The job opportunities for the landscape, 1.

[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.540]
The nightlife in the shopping, 0.

[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:01.380]
The big, oh, or the big eight.

[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:03.300]
The big eight golden.

[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.360]
Let's play some oldies, English, will you say?

[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:07.300]
Eight.

[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:11.820]
Now, when you take those calls, do you ever get a call occasionally from a blind mic?

[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.320]
Not for a long time.

[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:15.160]
Oh, good.

[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.640]
Or the real one, either.

[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.060]
Will you start that again?

[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:22.940]
No, we have a fake blind mic in case you didn't know.

[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:24.620]
Yeah, I do not have for years.

[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.400]
Real in the sand.

[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:26.740]
Yeah.

[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:27.620]
Sand?

[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:28.180]
Yeah.

[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:30.960]
Mine, mine, mine.

[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.520]
The band has seven, seven.

[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:36.600]
Well, I don't want that.

[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:42.660]
How come I can't find that the big is it under CKLW?

[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:45.700]
Maybe I doubt it.

[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:48.820]
The big eight golden.

[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:51.040]
It's under CKLW.

[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.600]
Those are the days, man.

[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.660]
Those are the days when having a radio was a precious thing, man.

[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:57.980]
Something you treasure, your little transistor sister.

[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:01.280]
I had a little white Philco transistor radio.

[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:03.820]
That thing was great.

[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.620]
Man, man, nothing was powerful at night.

[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:08.600]
Of course, in Michigan State, you're like up there in the middle of the country.

[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:11.860]
At night, WABC would just come zooming and pouring in.

[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:14.700]
And CKLW from Detroit from Windsor.

[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.180]
And WLS from Chicago.

[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.520]

[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.760]
A WBZ from Boston Radio 103.

[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:27.260]
And WHAM from Rochester, one of the worst radio stations in history of this business.

[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.260]
Terminal, Ponderous Boring.

[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.860]
50,000 watts of pure unadelterated swill.

[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:34.660]
Oh, Neil!

[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.300]
You're listening to Neil Rogers.

[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:37.460]
Well, here we go again.

[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.640]
WWBA, we're in West Virginia.

[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:41.900]
WI-60 Q-A-F.

[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.620]
All right, this is G Gordon Liddy.

[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.180]
And they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.

[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.500]
They were watching the game.

[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.560]
They needed notified points in public history.

[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.520]
May the best woman win.

[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.700]
Now, here's how to win.

[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:53.620]
And it's easy.

[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:54.620]
I believe I'm going to win.

[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:56.480]
In a short time, you'll make your win.

[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:57.600]
You'll need a real win.

[01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:59.660]
You and the obvious crowd.

[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.440]
No, the final four is going down.

[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:08.360]
And you're hoping you're that soft on the ground.

[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:10.260]
The cash isn't clean enough for.

[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:14.940]
Well, I guess as you win, Moola, you did good for yourself.

[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:18.720]
Well, some you'll start just things now.

[01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:23.260]
I'm picking random, good boy.

[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.820]
Got my experts as my down.

[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:29.560]
You expect me to go and choose the dark set.

[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.820]
I'm just guessing that my piece is smarter.

[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.100]
How much worse are I try?

[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.260]
You ain't done anything yet.

[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:39.360]
And we're dead.

[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.500]
You're too busy feeling, bracket's out.

[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.580]
When March Madness comes around.

[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.040]
No more pulling around.

[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:47.420]
I've got to get back to work.

[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:48.980]
I'm strong with you.

[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:49.480]
Get busy.

[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:51.680]
Oh, yeah, get those brackets filled out.

[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.080]
I'm sorry.

[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:52.620]
It's too late.

[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:53.520]
What a shame.

[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.220]
You might have won.

[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.540]
Is the Cousinion dollars there?

[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.180]
George, you might have won enough to buy you that new car

[01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:58.520]
that they're going to trade out for you.

[01:15:58.620 --> 01:15:58.960]
What does that matter?

[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:00.480]
We have a giant plotter of stone crabs here.

[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:01.600]
Oh, excellent.

[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.920]

Maybe you don't want to take a bite of food.

[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:40.460]

[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:36.700]
The exchange was confirmed to the Boston held by Severin's agent

[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:40.340]

[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:51.200]

Get off the FN state.

[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.900]
Grumpy old curmudgeon.

[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.560]
Why did anybody feel sorry for him?

[01:17:58.620 --> 01:17:59.480]
Even though he did get screwed.

[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.500]

It doesn't get any fresher than that.

[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:28.800]
Normally stone crabs go from the fishing boat to the fish house

[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.560]
then to the wholesaler then to the restaurant but at Billy Stone

[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:34.840]
crabs they go directly from the boat to your table or to their

[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:36.140]
own seafood market on the premises.

[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:39.600]
You can't get any fresher get a slap in the face.

[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:40.840]

Now South Florida is not famous for shopping like you know

[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:29.480]
like Milan or Rome Beverly Hills.

[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.380]
Am I right?

[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:32.800]

[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:44.680]
In the case some of the people in the building are listening.

[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:52.260]
You better be real selective who you give amount to.

[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:54.380]
Like.

[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.000]
Like people you know nice.

[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:58.740]
But yeah Todd Todd Dreck is not invited.

[01:28:59.160 --> 01:28:59.520]
Good.

[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:00.740]
Todd Dreck stay away.

[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.240]
And Gary Sarner if you're back in the building for a minute or two stay away too.

[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:05.580]
It's all trayf.

[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:11.040]
I bet you he resurfaces doing something.

[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:12.360]
Maybe cleaning toilets.

[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:13.060]
Gary Sarner.

[01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:14.180]
Yeah right.

[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:16.340]
I'm telling you.

[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:19.180]
He never leaves permanent.

[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.400]
He goes away for a little while and then all of a sudden it comes in like a bad penny.

[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:23.540]
He keeps showing up.

[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:30.540]
So anyway here's this email from the fake honorable Julio Robina office of the mayor of Hylia.

[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:32.640]
Hello Mr. Rogers.

[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:35.680]
As you may already know I have the honor and privilege to serve as Hylia's mayor.

[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:39.400]
I was surprised to receive more correspondence yesterday than I've ever received.

[01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:47.400]
I have it on good authority that you had my name in your mouth yesterday and that you disapprove of my characterization of the harness racing coming to Hylia Park.

[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:51.020]
Well guess what fake email or it's not harness racing it's quarter horses.

[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:57.080]
What is chariot racing a man on wheeled contraption with the whip and spike wheels?

[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:58.700]
Isn't that what harness racing is?

[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:01.040]
Oh yeah relax Tico calm.

[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.220]
What does that mean calm.

[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:03.140]
Mate calm down.

[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:03.700]
Calm.

[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:03.940]

[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:04.860]
Yes calm down.

[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:06.500]
Calm.

[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:07.460]
Mate calm.

[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:07.960]
Mate calm.

[01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:13.600]
To put the accent on the first syllable you speak a very guttable Spanish better than you.

[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.420]
Well yeah better better than me because I don't know.

[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.860]
The accent on the first syllable man calm.

[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:19.160]
Calm.

[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:20.360]
Mate calm.

[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:25.320]
I hope you give credit for at least keeping your chariot racing alive.

[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:31.440]
In fact I hope that this move will help me lock up the degeneral camera vote which I summarise is very powerful and has deep pockets.

[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:34.800]
That should come in very handy next time I need campaign contributions.

[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:38.060]
See what Westland mall I'll be making an appearance this Saturday.

[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:41.280]
I didn't know that Hylia was a toe tamper.

[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:43.460]
Wow.

[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:46.860]
I'm choked up over this email.

[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:48.620]
All right.

[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:52.140]
And I know what Hylia is doing at Westland on the weekend.

[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:53.700]
You're looking for glory hole.

[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:54.800]
And I'm sure you'll find some.

[01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:58.360]
So all certificates are processing.

[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:02.200]
How long does that process generally take?

[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:03.340]
That's sure like five minutes or so.

[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:03.880]
Really?

[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:05.080]
Not more than ten I don't think.

[01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:07.380]
Well you're just making that up.

[01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:08.920]
Yes yes I have.

[01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:11.020]
Well if we only had if we only had fat Chris here.

[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:13.640]
You know.

[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:17.500]
Oh it sold out.

[01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:18.340]
It's official.

[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:19.080]
All right see.

[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:22.100]
You know how I know because you go to current offers and it's not there anymore.

[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:23.780]
Sold out.

[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:24.520]
Sorry.

[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.740]
That may have been a record.

[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:30.260]
Can you believe it?

[01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:32.480]
That was like a minute or less I would say.

[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:35.620]
Let me look it up.

[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:36.020]
Billy.

[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:36.300]
Right.

[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:37.580]
Or just as sold out.

[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:38.400]
It doesn't have a time though.

[01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:41.720]
A minute or less.

[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.340]
Why doesn't it have the time on there yet?

[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:45.220]
Well I guess they still like.

[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:46.960]
They're still extrapolating that.

[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:47.440]
Would you relax?

[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:49.680]
Well you are so damn pushy.

[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:49.900]
Yeah.

[01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:52.080]
You're still eating?

[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:53.020]
Yes I am.

[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:54.480]
Everybody else.

[01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:56.180]
Wow.

[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:59.580]
We ought to do this in Neil deal every day.

[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:00.760]
Yeah.

[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.820]
Then that way Joe Bell couldn't be talking about.

[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:04.560]
He wanted to be able to shout out high Neil to you.

[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:06.300]
Who's that?

[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:06.740]
On three.

[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.080]
Everybody shout out high Neil.

[01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:09.240]
One two three.

[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:11.040]
Wow.

[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:13.380]
Holy cow.

[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.820]
Just get a little food in there and all of a sudden they discover we're on a year.

[01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:16.620]
That's amazing.

[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:18.180]
Got a whole bunch of women and Joe Bell.

[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:20.660]
Oh Joe Bell is in there and you're feeding him.

[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:25.620]
Be sure to doctor that food a little bit before he puts his fat claws on it.

[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:27.220]
Is he really in there?

[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:28.620]
No I made that up.

[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:32.900]
I don't hear him.

[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:33.980]
Hello Neil.

[01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:36.300]
Boy sure is quiet.

[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:38.020]
I'm eating.

[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:39.820]
Oh okay go back to the food.

[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:43.160]
We put something special in the mustard sauce for you.

[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:44.560]
Mouse.

[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:46.040]
Third.

[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:50.280]
How come you must have the monitor up a real real loud or something?

[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:51.380]
Feeding back.

[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:55.140]
Let's get back to the sanctity of the show and not worry about all these hazards okay?

[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:56.080]
Okay.

[01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:57.380]
Well these hazards go in.

[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:00.500]
Cayman says recently a coworker came out of the closet.

[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:04.300]
Some people have been giving him a hard time but thanks to you I've broken the homo barrier.

[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:05.780]
He is still my friend.

[01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.800]
He just keeps his hot dog in a different bun.

[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:09.740]
Well are are.

[01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:10.340]
Yeah.

[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:12.980]
Yuck yuck yuck.

[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:19.020]
Thanks to a disco though boy he sure got these people off the ranch and then when you threatened to take those great calls.

[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:20.020]
I'm your friend.

[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:22.920]
All of a sudden the show came back to life.

[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:27.320]
So ask jolly joe when Gary Surner is coming back.

[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:32.460]
Mike W says oh now this is interesting speaking of these certificates.

[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:33.660]
Yeah.

[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:39.200]
Because we do have a bunch of them left from dockers and also from Tonys.

[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:45.920]
And Michael says I purchased a $50 certificate for 25 bucks a couple weeks ago to Tonys pizza in North Miami at $441.

[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:50.340]
It was great a tiny hole in the wall but an awesome stromboli in pizza.

[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:52.900]
Yeah it's a little place but the food is spectacular.

[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:59.120]
I just mentioned that because there are still a bunch of left for Tonys and that's because a lot of people don't know where it is or never heard much about it.

[01:33:59.440 --> 01:33:59.540]
Right.

[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:02.920]
They were bringing you fruit and me free food for years.

[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:03.640]
Right.

[01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:08.140]
Before somebody stuck his fat face in that and said oh no more free food on here.

[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.900]
Unless I get some of it.

[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.220]
We can arrange that.

[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:12.680]
Huh?

[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:13.540]
We can arrange that.

[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.320]
Yeah maybe can make a deal with him on that.

[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:16.620]
Cut him in.

[01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:17.540]
That's right.

[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:18.500]
Cut him in for a slice.

[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:19.700]
Kick a little bit upstairs.

[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:20.520]
A little slice.

[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:24.360]
Of course make sure he gets it before somebody else comes back and visits the building.

[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:27.440]
And isn't it amazing how nobody seems to be wanting to put him on the air?

[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:27.980]
Local.

[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:30.140]
No local, the local one.

[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:31.340]
Even the Steve Lapa.

[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:35.240]
Will work for a new hair piece.

[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:36.000]
That's what I'm hearing.

[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:37.580]
No takers.

[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:42.280]
Cuban George says the reason I know what is involved today because it's a crappy day down here.

[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:43.380]
The weather sucks.

[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:44.660]
The economy sucks.

[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:50.660]
Our elected officials in my begin rate attacks a few tourists who do visit to build a giant landfill with a retractable roof in little Havana.

[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:56.100]
I really got to stop emailing you yesterday was that bitch Lucy Lopez today this stadium.

[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:59.360]
Let me go get my water gun and put in my mouth so I can slowly drown myself.

[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:04.380]
Take the rest of the off let George do his three hours on the Darwin theory and then it says.

[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.840]
Like that Cuban George you know Cuban George.

[01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:08.420]
No.

[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:09.680]
You don't.

[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:17.680]
Ricardo says I voted for sports teams.

[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:20.400]
I've got blind led in today's first race at Gulfstream.

[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:22.540]
Tudor on written by Tru Helio.

[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:25.980]
The fake Jim DeFida says PSI saw George on Friday.

[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:31.940]
I went to pick up a contest winning Nintendo Wii game with my nephew and he called the slabs and crazy which is true.

[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:33.840]
Also what happened to D.F.O.

[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:36.800]
What happened to D.F.O.?

[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:43.040]
You know anybody who is asking what happened to D.F.O. needs mental health needs to be immediately be corrected.

[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:44.880]
Is there any doubt about that?

[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:45.160]
No.

[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.840]
What's going on with D.F.O.

[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:50.140]
He's been gone all week.

[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:51.900]
Oh, Steve D.F.O alone.

[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:52.680]
Yeah.

[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.360]
Leave D.F.O alone.

[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:57.180]
We've Britney alone.

[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.940]
She was here on and she's back again tonight.

[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:00.160]
Maybe I'll go to the concert tonight.

[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:01.640]
There you go.

[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:04.180]
And I'm going to tell you we're faster than you know.

[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:10.300]
I left with my lesbian East terrorist cab driver for wood by yesterday at 3.40.

[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:17.680]
The concert was at 8 o'clock and we went by the air Canada Center on the way to the highway.

[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:22.900]
And I'm going to tell you you have just ziggins of punks all lined up inside.

[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:28.400]
Inside the door inside the area where you're waiting at the doors.

[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:31.940]
Now when you go to a concert you've got a ticket already right?

[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:33.620]
I mean this thing was sold out.

[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:36.340]
Or you could go and buy one from a scalper.

[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:38.680]
No, no, but these weren't people waiting to buy a scalping yet.

[01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:43.120]
They were already in online waiting for the doors to open which they didn't open until 7 o'clock.

[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:44.700]
What is the point in that?

[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:47.180]
I don't get what you mean.

[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:53.440]
What's the point of going to a venue where the event is going to take place three or four hours later?

[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.300]
They're going to open the doors.

[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:57.300]
What do you accomplish when you've already got a ticket for a particular seat?

[01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:59.400]
You get loaded before the show starts.

[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:00.720]
Was that what they were doing?

[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:01.200]
Sure.

[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.600]
And also socializing, milling about, you know, seeing...

[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:06.580]
Milling about, that was it.

[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:06.800]
That was it.

[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:07.820]
Being seen.

[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:09.740]
That kind of thing.

[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:12.720]
Oh, Ben Schmiegel is back again.

[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:15.080]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:16.540]
Oh, this is good.

[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:16.960]
Remember him?

[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:17.500]
No.

[01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.560]
Some way back in the early days of the emailing.

[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:20.380]
Now we're getting...

[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:21.380]
Now we're making some progress.

[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:26.380]
One of these guys who claims he's going away, yadi yadi yadi.

[01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:27.280]
You know something?

[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:28.880]
The people who say that they're going away.

[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:30.440]
They're the ones who would never go away.

[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:35.060]
If we were on here for another hundred years and they could manage to croak it out, they

[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:35.820]
would still be here.

[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:36.740]
Am I right?

[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:37.220]
When in doubt?

[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:37.820]
Croak it out?

[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:38.220]
You bet.

[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:40.020]
Ha ha.

[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:41.660]
Oh, here's another one for the poll.

[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:45.100]
Poll suggests, the best part of Florida is the cheap weed in excellent nightlife.

[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:48.400]
Well...

[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.540]
Nightlife's got one vote.

[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:52.940]
Landscapes got one vote.

[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:54.240]
Shopping's still got none.

[01:37:55.880 --> 01:38:01.020]
You want to go shopping, go to Boston, go to the great department stores in Rome,

[01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:02.840]
in Milano, in New York.

[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:04.700]
You sure don't want to go shopping.

[01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:05.860]
I mean, where do you want to go shopping?

[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:07.080]
Here?

[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:10.000]
Benchmigo says, enough of the eating bits on the ear.

[01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:11.780]
Hello and goodbye.

[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.860]
Why do you and your pig sidekick consist on eating on the ear?

[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:15.520]
Because we want to.

[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:22.520]
As if this is so funny to hear two grown men smacking their lips and chewing like pigs.

[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:25.640]
What I don't get is why you do it.

[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.000]
You know they're all saying it takes more...

[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:30.780]
It takes more muscle to frown than to smile.

[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:33.060]
What does that mean?

[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:36.240]
Well, it takes less energy to eat right than to eat like animals.

[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:38.240]
Goodbye, we'll not be listening for the rest of the day.

[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:40.740]
Too bad.

[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:42.600]
Benchmigo.

[01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:44.700]
Sour old coute.

[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:46.520]
A phony sour old coute, of course.

[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:48.260]
That's your buddy, John Z. T.R.

[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.040]
Where in T.

[01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:52.060]
Yeah.

[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:54.960]
That's it, it's your turn.

[01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:56.200]
Oh, it's my turn.

[01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:57.060]
Greg H.H.U.

[01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:00.800]
This portion of the show brought to you by Britney Spears, the JJ.

[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:02.900]
It's hanging out, y'all.

[01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:04.520]
It's a 12-18.

[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.260]
I love that.

[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:07.840]
That was cute.

[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:09.360]
Do you like it?

[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:10.340]
I loved it.

[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:10.900]
Oh.

[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.120]
No, you didn't.

[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:14.360]
So is Joe out of there already?

[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:15.040]
Yes.

[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:15.740]
Good.

[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:19.140]
I hope you doctor did you pee on his food before you gave it to him?

[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:21.700]
I licked all the stone crabs that I had to tell him before I gave him.

[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:23.840]
I don't think that would stop him.

[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:28.280]
You don't get a big fan ass like him by turning on food.

[01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:29.440]
What?

[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:30.740]
About being picky?

[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:32.140]
Yeah, that's Karam.

[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:33.120]
From a lickie from a spiky.

[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:35.180]
Should elected officials approve the stadium?

[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.320]
Here's the Miami-Herald poll on their website.

[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:40.840]
1148 votes.

[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:42.580]
And boy, it's almost 50, 50.

[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:43.680]
It's almost exactly even.

[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:45.600]
Yes, we need a new stadium for the marons.

[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:46.560]
579.

[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:47.820]
No, it's physically irresponsible.

[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:49.060]
569.

[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:50.140]
10 votes.

[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:55.980]
How many times do you think that David Samson and Laurie and his crew have voted on that thing?

[01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:57.500]
I don't know.

[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:01.500]
A bunch of bullcrap.

[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.540]
Well, one of these minutes on a herald something will happen.

[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:06.940]
Or maybe somebody will email us.

[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:10.320]
In fact, don't we have somebody covering that commission meeting?

[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:11.700]
I don't know.

[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:12.900]
Somebody from the station.

[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:13.720]
I'm sure we don't.

[01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:16.300]
We can't afford to be doing that.

[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:20.560]
Even though we're supposed to be the sports leader and the sports maven and the sport, yeah.

[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.200]
So what did Joe say about Sid the kid?

[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:24.780]
When was he certain two to four?

[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:26.160]
He didn't say anything about anything.

[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:26.520]

[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:27.940]
Said something about the food.

[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:29.560]
Said it was great.

[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:30.680]
Yeah, let me add it.

[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:31.780]
Is that for me?

[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:35.120]
Oh, my God.

[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:36.860]
Yeah, in this business about eating on ear.

[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:38.220]
How many hundred years?

[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:39.440]
About 30, man.

[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:40.660]
We've been eating on ear on the show.

[01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:43.660]
Long before even you even on Zeta, we used to eat on the show back on I and Z.

[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:47.300]
We had on the show back on W snooze we ate on the show.

[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:48.940]
So what what's the big sentence with it?

[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:51.360]
Oh, it sounds so it doesn't sound like anything.

[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:52.580]
Big deal.

[01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:55.160]
All these prissy sissies.

[01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:57.260]
Oh, God, we can't stand it.

[01:40:58.020 --> 01:40:58.760]
We like it.

[01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:01.700]
In fact, I got me a weenie in the refrigerator.

[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:04.040]
Maybe I'll maybe I'll during this next break.

[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:07.660]
I'll heat one up so I can enjoy you and picking out on the ear.

[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:10.740]
Well, what's the big deal with that?

[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:11.380]
I don't know.

[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:12.540]
Just though it's a fake email.

[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:14.300]
Just something to know it's something to bitch about.

[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.900]
That's all something to bitch about.

[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:16.540]
Billy.

[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:17.180]
Yeah.

[01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:19.060]
Yeah.

[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:21.420]
God.

[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:23.940]
Keep those emails coming.

[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:25.320]
We got an hour and 40 minutes to go.

[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.760]
I think during the break I'm going to put my shoes on my shirt.

[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:28.480]
I got my shirt.

[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:30.160]
My pants.

[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.160]
Not my shoes too early for my shoes.

[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:37.060]
About 150 and I crank the shoes on.

[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:39.280]
Start turning stuff off in here.

[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:43.520]
Boy, you ought to see on wood buying days at two o'clock I am so ready to fly out of here

[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:44.380]
at two you wouldn't believe it.

[01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:44.980]
I believe it.

[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:46.880]
When the big hand hits the little hand I'm gone.

[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:47.780]
And once I'm gone.

[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:48.920]
Yeah, it's gone.

[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:49.160]
You're gone.

[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:51.960]
Can't believe how fast we sold those certificates.

[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:52.540]
I can't.

[01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:53.280]
I can.

[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:55.800]
I mean, it's a great place.

[01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:57.100]
Great food.

[01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:58.400]
Very, very popular.

[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:00.160]
But there's a lot of fact.

[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:00.640]
There are other things.

[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:00.720]
I can't.

[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:02.440]
The matter is it's a tough times man.

[01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:05.440]
And which is good people are saving half off the cost of a meal.

[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:09.660]
That's all the more reason why those meal deals make sense now.

[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:11.780]
And they always made sense before but not right.

[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.520]
And did Jolly Joe say, hey, great job with the certificates, guys.

[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:15.280]
No.

[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:15.960]
Did he say that?

[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:16.140]
No.

[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:16.840]
He did it last week.

[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:17.080]
No.

[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:19.960]
He's not second around this week like it was last week.

[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:21.140]
I wonder what he wanted last week.

[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:27.520]
Well, Neil, we've decided to give you another 20% pay cut off the, you know, something like that.

[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:33.760]
Now that I'm searching for a new agent, anybody out there want to be my agent?

[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:39.680]
Got to work cheap and got to communicate with me at least like two, three times a year would be good.

[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:43.960]
Unlike Norma Kent, who's busy with fantasy baseball and fantasy,

[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:45.640]
Faggery and whatever the hell he's doing.

[01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:48.840]
Probably riding around town looking for runaway strays.

[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:53.240]
The Kenny Rogers says, you rule, George two, subject Jonas Brothers.

[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:56.180]
Oh my God.

[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:57.900]
Are you kidding me when you get a chance?

[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:02.340]
Can you please play that Negro buffet call you play the other day where the priest calls into advice?

[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:03.900]
This guy don't even know that's Phil Henry.

[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:07.080]
You know which one I'm talking about?

[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:10.960]
Yeah, all you can eat Negro and it's five minutes long and I played like about once every six months, once a year.

[01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:11.360]
That's it.

[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:16.180]
I want a buddy of mine from the UK to hear it so we can get hooked on your show and you can get the new listeners

[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:18.140]
since you seem to be such an all right guy and such.

[01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:19.540]
All right, go ahead, go ahead.

[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:19.900]
No.

[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:22.620]
I'm somebody of his in the UK to hear it.

[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:25.200]
I'm playing bits on command for the fake Kenny Rogers.

[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:27.180]
Or maybe the real one.

[01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:27.560]
I don't know.

[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:28.020]
I don't know.

[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:28.920]
Nothing about that guy.

[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:31.920]
And if it only needed anybody else, he got candy across the street.

[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:35.500]
So we wanted him badly just like that twerp.

[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:40.380]
So when's jerks coming back?

[01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:41.740]
I don't know.

[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:42.960]
Any minute now.

[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:47.480]
Why did Mr. Freeze send me this twice?

[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:48.580]
The cheap weed in the air somewhere?

[01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:49.780]
Did you put the cheap weed?

[01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:50.960]
No, did you want me to?

[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:52.100]
No, it's up to you.

[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:53.160]
You're the a pole myster.

[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:54.440]
What do you mean do I want you to do?

[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.140]
You do whatever you want.

[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:55.880]
Okay.

[01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:57.660]
You can be as lazy as you want to be.

[01:43:57.860 --> 01:43:58.600]
We're mailing it anyway.

[01:43:58.980 --> 01:43:59.320]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:01.620]
We're mailing it in and we're proud of it.

[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.000]
Remember that crap from a John ZTR?

[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:07.220]
Those were some excellent emails, some of those early ones.

[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:07.920]
They were funny.

[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:08.660]
He put it effort in.

[01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:09.320]
I'll give them that.

[01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:10.880]
He's not doing any more though.

[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:16.800]
Your listeners can calm down says Harry, Carrie, the real one.

[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:19.920]
DFO is on WFTL this morning.

[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:22.360]
We can all listen to Joy Reynolds since he's dead up here.

[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:23.920]
And then hang over and listen to DFO.

[01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:24.640]
He'll be dead soon.

[01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:26.700]
Go Cubs says the dead Harry.

[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:28.600]
So me fo is back on.

[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:30.800]
Well, thank God we don't have to get any more of those hysterical.

[01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:31.820]
Let me.

[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:33.480]
Oh, what happened to DFO?

[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:35.260]
Leave him alone.

[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:39.860]
So I don't know whether he's going to take that deal with cheap channel

[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:40.980]
and do mornings of 940.

[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:41.880]
They sure got a signal.

[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:45.040]
Of course, the area did that Fox Sports Radio once before.

[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:47.080]
And boy, you talk about laying a gigantic egg.

[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:50.020]
Wow, even Henny Penny never leading egg that big.

[01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:51.300]
Remember Henny Penny?

[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:52.420]
Yep.

[01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:57.120]
She used to shop at the Westland at JC Penny.

[01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:01.140]
The best thing about living in South Florida is how many votes

[01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:01.440]
we got?

[01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:02.540]
537.

[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:03.840]
Not too bad.

[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:06.580]
The next act's down nine point.

[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:07.580]
How is the Dow doing?

[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.080]
We're not supposed to watch it.

[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:10.000]
Down.

[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:11.240]
Oh, 90 points down.

[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:12.240]
I'm a negative side.

[01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:12.680]
Ooh.

[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:14.760]
I'm sorry, ask.

[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:15.660]
Get required on it.

[01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:16.180]
I'm a case.

[01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:17.700]
He's a case.

[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.760]
Best thing about living in South Florida is the weather 176th

[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:22.920]
and E. O'Rodger show 99.

[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:24.880]
I don't live in South Florida 89.

[01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:28.260]
16.5% of the audience don't live in South Florida.

[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:29.780]
That means they're listening online elsewhere.

[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:32.200]
The beach 50.

[01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:33.840]
My family is here 47.

[01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:35.360]
My family isn't here 19.

[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:36.820]
The Everglades 14.

[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:37.760]
The women 12.

[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:39.440]
The diverse culture 10.

[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:40.780]
The sports team 7.

[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.040]
The food 7.

[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:43.600]
The job opportunities 5.

[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:44.820]
And they have the nightlife only 1.

[01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:48.980]
The landscape Salamente uno and the shopping 0.

[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:49.760]
None.

[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:53.840]
There isn't one person who says the best thing about South Florida is the shopping.

[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:54.460]
How do you like that?

[01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:55.320]
Yeah.

[01:45:56.820 --> 01:45:58.540]
Now, here's an email from Justin.

[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:01.620]
He says pool addition.

[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:02.440]
I don't think so.

[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:04.660]
Although it's a different kind of pool at P.O.L.E.

[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:07.380]
He says the only thing keeps me in South Florida fishing is the best.

[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:09.160]
He's got a fishing pool.

[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:10.240]

[01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:21.180]
the fishing report

[01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:24.180]

all he did yeah

[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:39.520]
how you know what he

[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:41.260]
nice to know you still alive

[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:43.320]
one of the good guys

[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:48.240]
we say that's a judge can get some free concert tickets occasionally that's

[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.920]
right i wonder for the grabers uh... hooked up with the joe and spru

[01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:52.540]
maybe

[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:55.540]
you want to go

[01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:56.420]
go what

[01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:59.420]
toward jones brothers of course not a crazy

[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.860]
yeah but i want to go back to the age

[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:04.640]
i want to go back to the shower with joe

[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:07.180]
take a shower and let me get you a job as a roadie

[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:10.340]

[01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:12.400]
shmir it around

[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:19.240]
that's a good question what do you think the jones brothers use body wash

[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:20.200]
soap

[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:22.540]
i don't think they did use the soap

[01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:28.340]
terrified some of the they probably all drop it

[01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:33.460]
jane and your field whom i love dearly is a regular contributor going

[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:36.400]
way back to the fact is before you talk to me into this email crap

[01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:39.920]
no i said the email stuff i love you don't like it that's a funny part was

[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:43.860]
your idea the first place right and i finally after the new years of a

[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:45.720]
resisting i said you know that's a great idea

[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:48.620]
my idea was that you should have an email address that uh... the public

[01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:49.720]
and send you emails on

[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:54.200]
was not my idea that you read emails from the guy with the eyes all day long

[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:03.460]
well sure that we

[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:11.720]
jays says when george carl was asked about his ponytail he answered was to

[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:15.400]
piss people off with the eating on the air business this seems to be

[01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:18.760]
right to this well i think with your recent low ratings you might want to

[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:20.140]
reconsider this all yeah

[01:51:21.540 --> 01:51:24.720]
i've only been you know what like it the ratings have a lot to do with the

[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:25.600]
word you know the year

[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:29.960]
all his one from the dead mic reary

[01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:33.420]
what's the matter with your memory neither was bouncer smith you're getting old

[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:36.820]
y'all hold with y'all god to y'all get what y'all want my

[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:40.440]
p.s. pa'll harvies up here now he doesn't like you

[01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:45.480]
how's Roger magulin doing by the way

[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:48.800]
have a long time he should check in with the fake Roger

[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:50.980]
faggle and magulin auto check in

[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:52.200]
when you're a producer

[01:51:56.100 --> 01:52:00.040]
who also wanted to be my producers would get your fired right have both jobs

[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:01.480]
so that you could get a raise

[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:24.820]
i'm just i'm just uh... i don't know what the word is

[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:27.640]
astonished

[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:32.780]
flabbergasted by some of the stuff that comes on there

[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:34.040]
into

[01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:35.460]
indeed

[01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:37.500]
so says

[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:42.200]
sorry to complain to you but i'm a black listener and took offense to a racist

[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:43.580]
comment you said last week

[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:47.960]
and come by surprise because you really make fun of blacks as you know rc colas

[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:48.980]
big among the black communities

[01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:50.300]
why did not know that

[01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:55.260]
this is not an opinion it's a fact that any black neighborhood and ask around

[01:53:56.520 --> 01:54:00.420]
so a shock when george asked you if you drank rc colin you said well i have an

[01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:02.160]
rc colin a koonz age

[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:04.700]
how do you respond to this does ain't cool new

[01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:12.000]
i haven't had rc colin a long time how's that make you feel better sound with

[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.040]
your fake uh... outrage

[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:17.880]
did you know rc colas big among blacks i never heard of such a thing

[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:21.080]
or see the rc thing that's about we heard it's easy high-r

[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:23.200]
yeah you're such a big it's not a bitch

[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:26.060]
probably don't like to figure this either

[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:27.800]
i did not know that

[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:29.980]
no i never heard of such a thing

[01:54:29.980 --> 01:54:32.920]
we drink it all up and i made a racial comment about that's probably from

[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:34.340]
oj mcduffin right i thought it was a

[01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:35.200]
but i'm not a thing

[01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:39.720]
yeah rc coli thought was something like a bc powder right rc colab bc

[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:40.440]
powder that's right

[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:41.740]
that's correct

[01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:43.660]
so take a powder sale

[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:45.720]
god

[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:50.000]
and if south park is doing that thing of what was it called mr. koon

[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:51.320]
the koon

[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:55.640]
the koon the koon that's even worse yeah also

[01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:57.040]
don't bother

[01:54:59.240 --> 01:54:59.600]
christ

[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:02.360]
christ knew i was just how big is that we need to be needed for a whole segment

[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:05.140]
well that's because you only take one bite at a time you don't have time you

[01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:05.480]
got to like

[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:07.620]
you know interrupt your eating with a little bit of talk

[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:13.040]
you know this is interesting because

[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:16.120]
russell the cocoa beach or whatever he called chronic

[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:19.520]
he sent me this email long time ago it's in my pile here somewhere would go

[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:21.300]
you to it soon because i'm almost out of material

[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:23.100]
and he sends it again

[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:24.660]
now this is a guy who is

[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:25.560]
supposedly

[01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:27.880]
like you know coherent

[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.800]
the signal is five by hearing cocoa today about 175 miles

[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:35.680]
what has changed is that in the past few days the Cuban interference

[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:38.620]
normally not an issue in central florida has been clearly audible

[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:41.200]
so i think your signal is probably unchanged

[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:45.420]
but there is it's gotten stronger fidel probably made we we on the tower

[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:47.100]
if it went out and peed on the tower

[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:49.000]
they're cranking it up

[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:55.300]
i think what we get some tremendous publicity if the beesleaves would like

[01:55:55.300 --> 01:55:58.160]
haran assassin for rauul and uh... fidel

[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:03.420]
they we send our people down there in shut off all those damn cubus at least a

[01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:06.700]

[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:08.240]

[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:09.100]
attachment with some sound the thing on it some audio crap

[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:12.000]

[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:16.740]
i don't know i don't think it was Kathy was chattie Kathy no it was some guy okay

[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:20.460]
because i got something from Kathy what was it a song

[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:28.520]
and what is it about a m radio you want to play it no it's not good it's okay but

[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:33.100]
it's a old pop song older a few years old

[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:39.060]
it's called a m radio yeah who's it by

[01:58:39.860 --> 01:58:46.120]
ever clear i think everqueer yes you are see there you go that the bed

[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:51.260]
but what's your name for Montana Heather yeah she's pitting you against me

[01:58:53.680 --> 01:59:00.640]
frank says hearing the cklw jingle earlier drags back my youth cklw drags back as you

[01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:18.120]
k-l-w yesterday oh so schmaltzi in it he says love that station was so powerful it was like a

[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:22.340]
local Cleveland station where i grew up yeah eight hundred down the down man with a signal

[01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:29.460]
that was just killer and right next to it at eight ten was a zillion watt station from bon air

[01:59:29.460 --> 01:59:33.440]
you know where bon air is just north of anathwaeila no it's like a little island just

[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:36.740]
north and the same thing like with fidelity you know they run a half a million watts

[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:42.500]
mm-hmm and so depending on where you were in the country in the east or midwest

[01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:49.580]
on depending on the weather and what are the conditions cklw would either come in really crystal

[01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:54.240]
clear or that damn bon air station would sometimes interfere with it really piss you off bon air

[01:59:54.240 --> 02:00:00.540]
was it was an all-religion paid religion crack oh anyway frank says there's a radio junkie i

[02:00:00.540 --> 02:00:04.660]
spend hours in the basement slowly dialing in the giant rc a radio to hear what far off stations

[02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:08.900]
would come in when i should have been paging through a playboy or doing something constructive

[02:00:09.740 --> 02:00:15.620]
it was cool when kmwxwcfl kdkwbzwbcn others came in depending on the weather

[02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:20.160]
a san Antonio texas station was the farthest i remember picking up

[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:28.660]
you didn't mention wwe33we or earlier as wkyc no i did not because i'm not a Cleveland guy

[02:00:28.660 --> 02:00:33.020]

[02:12:41.260 --> 02:12:44.160]
What I said was that I was looking up the TV.

[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:44.160]

[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:44.160]

[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:44.160]

[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:44.160]

[02:12:44.380 --> 02:12:44.400]
Mother.

[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:44.420]
Oh, my outline is beautiful.

[02:12:44.420 --> 02:12:44.420]

[02:12:44.420 --> 02:12:45.260]
I guess I've played it too much.

[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:47.740]
I said it was time to give it a rest

[02:12:47.740 --> 02:12:49.520]
when all the other people were saying that I agreed.

[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:52.900]
I gave it a rest and now it's back.

[02:12:53.220 --> 02:12:54.500]
You least expected it made a comeback.

[02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:55.120]
Let's hear it.

[02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:56.180]
It's whack, it's great.

[02:12:57.020 --> 02:12:58.220]
So a sal is back, he says,

[02:12:58.220 --> 02:12:59.640]
I'm as black as black and good.

[02:13:00.580 --> 02:13:01.780]
I heard someone on the email say

[02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:03.140]
there can't be a black man named Sal.

[02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:04.220]
Go educate yourself.

[02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:06.880]
Sal isn't as common as Lamar or Rashid,

[02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:09.020]
but there are sal's out there in the hood, so Sal.

[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:11.600]
And let me educate you a little bit, Sal.

[02:13:11.980 --> 02:13:14.300]
That expression about having heard such and such

[02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:16.900]
in a coon's age, that's a different kind of coon, okay?

[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:18.120]
Then what you're thinking?

[02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:21.880]
There's more than one way to skin a cat.

[02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:26.740]
Am I right there's more than one kind of coon?

[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:29.120]
Yeah, well there you go.

[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:30.560]
He's thinking it means black people.

[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:32.400]
Coon, I mean, did you ever see a raccoon?

[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:33.860]
Just this morning.

[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:36.140]
Oh, when you stop with that crap,

[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:37.640]
yeah, I thought we'd get through the whole day without that.

[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:39.060]
And by the way, speaking of getting through the whole day,

[02:13:39.100 --> 02:13:39.860]
it's only 105.

[02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:42.000]
Is it just me or what?

[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.820]
This seems like one of the longest shows in history.

[02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:47.840]
Not to make so?

[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:49.740]
Not any different than any other.

[02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:51.260]
Manish, Tama, Halala, Haze.

[02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:51.700]
Amen.

[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:54.120]
Maru, Khatod, Noi.

[02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:56.860]
Here's an update.

[02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:00.320]
Miami Commissioner Mark Sarnoff

[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:02.220]
is now giving a long speech about what a bad deal

[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:03.300]
this stadium thing is.

[02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:04.400]
Sarnoff for mayor.

[02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:05.180]
All right.

[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:08.280]
That's the only update we got.

[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:10.540]
And of course, I don't think we probably have anybody over there.

[02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:12.860]
I mean, what a farce that would be.

[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:14.500]
This is supposed to be your sports station.

[02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:16.360]
Not your Marlin station.

[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:17.120]
No more thank God.

[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:18.420]
We lost enough money on that crap.

[02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:21.720]
In addition to which David Samson and Jolly Jovelle

[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:23.140]
hate each other like poison.

[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:27.220]
I would say even more than Tom Jicke and Jolly Jovelle

[02:14:27.220 --> 02:14:27.720]
hate each other.

[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:28.560]
All that saying a lot.

[02:14:28.940 --> 02:14:29.680]
That's pushing it.

[02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:32.220]
So speaking of the ruins,

[02:14:33.220 --> 02:14:35.620]
many from Kendall says, this is the fake man.

[02:14:36.020 --> 02:14:37.440]
Who knows which one it is?

[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:39.020]
Armando, Kenneth Speron.

[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:41.760]
That one?

[02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:42.340]
Yeah.

[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:45.020]
He says, just wanted to let you know I help grow and develop

[02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:47.020]
those tourist eating vines and plants here in Mexico.

[02:14:47.340 --> 02:14:49.720]
As a matter of fact, they have a seem to have a real taste

[02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:52.700]
for fat old Jews, which was not reflected in the movie.

[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:55.200]
Come down to Al Capulco and I'll be happy to give you

[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:56.560]
a personal tour of the ruins.

[02:14:57.540 --> 02:14:59.260]
The girl who comes out of the shower with a towel,

[02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:00.720]
then on dresses was pretty hot,

[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:01.760]
but she got dressed right away.

[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:04.080]
I was hoping for some action with her boyfriend,

[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:05.100]
but it never happened.

[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:06.760]
He was right there looking at her.

[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:10.360]
P.S. last week I sent you an email asking

[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:11.640]
whatever become of young Neil.

[02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:13.100]
He must be in his 20s by now.

[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:13.700]
Have you heard from him?

[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:14.540]
What does that mean?

[02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:17.260]
The bit?

[02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:19.880]
No, I know the bit, but what is that?

[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:21.720]
And my vote for the poll is there's nothing good

[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:22.560]
about living in South Florida.

[02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:23.740]
Well, there you go.

[02:15:24.020 --> 02:15:25.380]
That's why you're not there and I'm not even.

[02:15:25.860 --> 02:15:27.060]
But it's not a negative poll.

[02:15:27.260 --> 02:15:28.540]
Try to be a little bit positive.

[02:15:28.700 --> 02:15:32.060]
People are depressed, A.I.G. and the freaking depression

[02:15:32.060 --> 02:15:35.060]
and everybody's got to work and the falling dollar

[02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:38.680]
and the falling dow all fall down.

[02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:40.720]
You still haven't seen that, have you?

[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:41.080]
No.

[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:47.940]
Now who's in that brand?

[02:15:48.020 --> 02:15:50.360]
She was in brand, well, I know brand of the will

[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:52.860]
to end Carl Maldon and Warren baby.

[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:55.360]
And what's your name?

[02:15:55.820 --> 02:15:57.640]
She was in on the waterfront.

[02:15:58.340 --> 02:15:59.460]
Eva, Eva Marie Saint.

[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:00.440]
I think that was a.

[02:16:01.660 --> 02:16:02.700]
Remember Eva Marie Saint?

[02:16:02.860 --> 02:16:03.040]
Sure.

[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:05.900]
She was in on the waterfront with Marlon Brando.

[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:07.780]
You know, the fact that he died, I don't know,

[02:16:07.860 --> 02:16:08.720]
there should have been like a big,

[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:10.380]
something a little bit more of a big

[02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:12.900]
simmiss about that when he died, when you think, right?

[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:16.340]
He was, he was pretty important guy, Marlon Brando.

[02:16:16.460 --> 02:16:18.900]
I'll say he was the Godfrey Confada, right?

[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:20.920]
He was Stanley Kowalski.

[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:21.940]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:22.940]
He was all of these things.

[02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:24.260]
And he died, that was it.

[02:16:25.480 --> 02:16:27.500]
Of course, he weighed like what, 7,000 pounds.

[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:29.680]
Well, people tend not to be really sympathetic

[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:31.460]
when you balloon up like that and then you croak.

[02:16:31.460 --> 02:16:32.900]
Well, they see a dead man walking.

[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:33.800]
Yeah.

[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:38.660]
Should elected officials approve the stadium,

[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:40.700]
latest vote, 1259 on the Herald website,

[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:43.380]
1259 votes, and it's 51 to 49.

[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:45.660]
The Marlon people are like jamming on this.

[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:47.640]
They probably got a conference table

[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:49.460]
with people sitting around tapping it out.

[02:16:50.420 --> 02:16:52.660]
Yes, we need new stadium for the Marlon 640.

[02:16:53.020 --> 02:16:54.780]
No, it's physical, irresponsible, 619.

[02:16:55.860 --> 02:16:57.900]
So it's within like 21 votes, but nevertheless,

[02:16:58.420 --> 02:17:00.700]
they keep pushing it ahead because they're, you know,

[02:17:00.700 --> 02:17:02.980]
they want to give the appearance of the public as for it.

[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:05.060]
If they want to give the appearance of the public's for it,

[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:06.140]
why don't they put it to a public vote?

[02:17:06.420 --> 02:17:07.020]
That's what I say.

[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:08.300]
Let the people of the county decide

[02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:10.340]
if they want to pee away their money for millionaires

[02:17:10.340 --> 02:17:13.180]
on this damn stadium for a ball club

[02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:14.540]
that nobody gives a crap about first.

[02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:17.840]
And in the non-sports town, it's got 15 different sports

[02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:20.040]
talk stations, but nobody cares about sports.

[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:24.060]
That's the, that's the real peel of the banana.

[02:17:25.500 --> 02:17:27.440]
Nobody goes to these damn games.

[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:28.780]
Nobody gives a flying crap.

[02:17:29.380 --> 02:17:30.400]
Or here's the fishing guy.

[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:33.120]
Captain Bouncer Smith, he, we know,

[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:36.640]
he still gives the fishing reports on another station.

[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:38.720]
I saw Jimmy Cifilis this month

[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:40.220]
at the Coconut Grove Art Festival.

[02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:41.840]
His hair is completely white.

[02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:42.800]
He looks like an old lady.

[02:17:43.140 --> 02:17:44.200]
Hey, does look like an old lady.

[02:17:45.140 --> 02:17:49.040]
Maybe you should call Cubans Jorge instead of Julio's

[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:50.520]
says Jorge and South Miami.

[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:51.520]
And that's an idea.

[02:17:52.180 --> 02:17:52.580]
Yeah.

[02:17:52.980 --> 02:17:54.500]
What do you think is a more common first name?

[02:17:55.340 --> 02:17:56.240]
Julio Jorge.

[02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:57.260]
Jose.

[02:17:57.440 --> 02:17:57.440]

[02:17:58.220 --> 02:18:01.720]
No, I'm talking of those two Jorge or Julio Jorge

[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:02.320]
without a doubt.

[02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:04.260]
Oh, without a lot of Jorge's.

[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:04.420]
Sure.

[02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:06.820]
Not so many Nelson's though.

[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:10.000]
No, but I'll, amongst the spicks.

[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:13.020]
More than more than any other group.

[02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:15.360]
What Nelson?

[02:18:15.660 --> 02:18:17.620]
Yeah, as a matter of fact, you're the only non-spick Nelson

[02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:18.440]
I've ever heard of.

[02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:19.200]
Get out of here.

[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:20.120]
What about Nelson Riddle?

[02:18:20.420 --> 02:18:21.160]
Oh, yeah, that guy.

[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:23.300]
Yeah, the music guy from Capitol Records.

[02:18:23.300 --> 02:18:23.440]
Right.

[02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:25.100]
What about Nelson Eddie?

[02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:26.620]
Cut the music.

[02:18:26.820 --> 02:18:27.000]
All right.

[02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:27.700]
Nelson Mandela.

[02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:28.960]
What about Nelson?

[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:30.520]
The Nelson twins Rick Nelson.

[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:31.780]
Oh, that's the last name, right?

[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:32.600]
Well, who cares?

[02:18:33.260 --> 02:18:34.140]
They're always right now anyway.

[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:34.520]
I'm sure.

[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:38.020]
Anyway, Sam says I know what people don't come for.

[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:39.400]
And that's the culture mix down here.

[02:18:39.580 --> 02:18:41.140]
The channel 10 thinks it's so wonderful.

[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:43.860]
If they were, they would be going to a little Havana.

[02:18:43.860 --> 02:18:45.740]
We know nobody is going to waste their time there.

[02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:48.700]
The best move by everybody I see down here

[02:18:48.700 --> 02:18:52.560]
was from Miami Beach officials letting the topless scene

[02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:53.340]
go on the beach.

[02:18:54.060 --> 02:18:55.420]
My experience with culture down here

[02:18:55.420 --> 02:18:57.620]
has been dead chickens at four-way stops.

[02:18:58.060 --> 02:19:00.120]
Live chickens go to another assorted farm animals,

[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:03.820]
running into the streets, road rage, short little guys selling

[02:19:03.820 --> 02:19:05.860]
four lemons in a plastic bag by the road set.

[02:19:06.220 --> 02:19:06.680]
Oh, yeah.

[02:19:07.980 --> 02:19:10.860]
In closing, any friend that ever visited me down here

[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:13.420]
has never made the request of going to see Domino Park.

[02:19:14.540 --> 02:19:17.760]
PS Big Fan of the Future of AM Radio, the GA show.

[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:21.840]
What does that mean?

[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:23.260]
Gamblers and honors?

[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:25.200]
No, I know what G.A. is, but what does that mean?

[02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:25.720]
I don't know.

[02:19:25.980 --> 02:19:27.180]
Maybe it's a joke we don't get.

[02:19:28.180 --> 02:19:31.040]
Rob says, I know you're gay, but it's fun to get a gay man's

[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:34.880]
opinion once in a while on what's straight men find attractive.

[02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:37.740]
What's your opinion on the following actresses in terms of

[02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:38.380]
hotness?

[02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:41.520]
Jessica Alba, Scarlett Johansson, Megan Fox,

[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:43.880]
Kim Kardashian, and Halfway.

[02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:46.660]
Scarlett Johansson gets my vote.

[02:19:49.660 --> 02:19:51.180]
No, I'm not arguing with you.

[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:51.640]
Let's go.

[02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:57.020]
And I'm supposed to know all the like Megan Fox, who now is that?

[02:19:57.180 --> 02:19:57.360]
Megan.

[02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:00.480]
Megan, Megan, Megan, the girl in the Transfigure.

[02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:00.940]
Megan Vedgin.

[02:20:01.300 --> 02:20:01.480]
Yeah.

[02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:05.880]
Who is this guy, this Martian guy on CNN?

[02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.220]
Places from a task area.

[02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:10.940]
I'm fishing, if they're hiring, calling places,

[02:20:11.180 --> 02:20:12.560]
seeing if they're hiring, going online,

[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:13.220]
and applying.

[02:20:13.380 --> 02:20:13.800]
Look at that.

[02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:17.320]
Turn on CNN and maybe in the past, what is that?

[02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:20.840]
I record a tile ever been in one interview.

[02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:22.780]
Avery, a mask-y-a-loys, looking for a job.

[02:20:22.900 --> 02:20:23.680]
No job, no hopes.

[02:20:23.940 --> 02:20:25.060]
I can't imagine why.

[02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:26.320]
I'm in a labor department for them here,

[02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:27.540]
listening to Neil Rogers.

[02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:28.020]
Wow.

[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:29.580]
What is it?

[02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:30.960]
I don't know.

[02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:31.500]
I don't know.

[02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:34.080]
Q-A-F-B-O-D.

[02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:34.140]

[02:20:37.380 --> 02:20:38.060]
That's absolutely.

[02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:45.280]
Everybody needs a fear, especially me.

[02:20:47.920 --> 02:20:52.220]
Not a good idea to appear like a mincing queen.

[02:20:53.260 --> 02:20:58.120]
You ferry, essentially, upheasing what the breeder's fear.

[02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:01.800]
By pretending that I'm not a queer,

[02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:05.900]
no one will ever know that I'm a homo.

[02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:09.240]
They'll just say, eat, marry, you know.

[02:21:12.060 --> 02:21:14.560]
Holding back my passion for sports,

[02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:16.240]
to now end in.

[02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:22.980]
Faking I like women more than watching men.

[02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:23.780]
Yeah.

[02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:29.300]
I've got a bit, but inside I'm dying.

[02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:32.580]
Living a life that nobody's buying.

[02:21:33.140 --> 02:21:36.700]
Now I gotta live a life and act apart.

[02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:40.920]
But it's been that every heart.

[02:21:40.920 --> 02:21:41.140]
Oh cannot go.

[02:21:42.820 --> 02:21:46.960]
I don't have the balls to admit, I pushing fall.

[02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:53.180]
I don't have the balls to admit I'm singing.

[02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:53.840]
Ball.

[02:21:56.620 --> 02:22:00.780]
I don't have the balls to admit I'm solving, I'm hitting false.

[02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:01.160]
Huh.

[02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:07.640]
I just don't have the balls to admit I play chin ball

[02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:15.880]
19 at 560 wqm happy Thursday or the weekends almost here my god life is

[02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:22.380]
Passing us by sometimes I feel don't you feel right now now Teresa says poor Teresa

[02:22:22.380 --> 02:22:25.760]
I wouldn't let the Teresa in the building or any of her kin

[02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:31.740]
Teresa says oh Neil bless you in your sidekick you are a great person you'll enhance them too

[02:22:32.460 --> 02:22:36.060]
I must admit that you are a very handsome man and very popular here where I live

[02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:41.560]
Me and some other women can't believe that you are gay to think the Lord would take such a handsome man away from women

[02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:43.280]
Life is to unfair Neil

[02:22:44.060 --> 02:22:44.820]
says Teresa

[02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:49.880]
See what I mean? Yeah, if she shows up there call a cops. Okay

[02:22:51.100 --> 02:22:54.200]
Oh, I speak out of call a cops. This is a very disturbing story

[02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:59.100]
Cleveland Brown's wide receiver Don A. Stahlworth was driving drunk

[02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:05.580]
Blood alcohol to show he was over the legal limit last weekend when he struck in Kilde pedestrian with his Bentley a

[02:23:05.580 --> 02:23:07.860]
Miami Beach Channel 7 reported today

[02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:14.300]
Miami Beach Police would not confirm the TV stations report that they had a blood level alcohol of alcohol level of 0.12

[02:23:14.300 --> 02:23:17.080]
The legal limit is 0.08 his was 0.12

[02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:18.980]
half again over legal limit

[02:23:19.800 --> 02:23:25.700]
We haven't released anything regarding the blood work said Jenny Velasquez a Miami Beach police spokeswoman. We're not confirming anything

[02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:30.820]
No charges have been filed against Stahlworth 28 who has seen on the video obtained by the hell being given a

[02:23:30.820 --> 02:23:33.380]
sobriety test by two Miami Beach police officers

[02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:39.920]
Stahlworth who is cooperating with police issued a statement yesterday expressing his condolences to the family of Mario Reyes

[02:23:40.700 --> 02:23:46.620]
My family and I are grief-stricken over the tragic accident which occurred Saturday in Miami Beach where Mario Reyes sadly lost his life

[02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:52.700]
Stahlworth said and they prepared statement my thoughts and prayers are with the Reyes family during this incredibly difficult time

[02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:59.880]
Reyes 15 I was getting off work as an overnight crane operator tried across the street to catch a bus home just after 7 a.m

[02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:01.140]
He died at the scene

[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:05.560]
Reyes was born in Cuba left as a teenager for a better life in the U.S

[02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:11.040]
He worked numerous construction jobs. He was an avid baseball fan, especially fond of the Florida Marlins

[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:17.220]
Reyes survived by his wife of almost 20 years Catalina and a company a couple's 15-year-old daughter Daniela

[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:21.260]
So a court of channel seven Donnie Stahlworth was a little

[02:24:22.420 --> 02:24:23.060]
very

[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:29.660]
Pi-eyed yeah when he hit the pedestrian

[02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:32.300]
But nevertheless we'll see

[02:24:33.900 --> 02:24:37.160]
Gravity guys says question on importance of early FM as

[02:24:38.260 --> 02:24:43.660]
As the kid growing up in Miami in the 70s I have fun memories of listening to Ricky Tiki on WQA. I'm on a.m

[02:24:43.660 --> 02:24:47.800]
This is while all my friends were hooked on FM to listen to their music. I don't think so

[02:24:49.780 --> 02:24:52.780]
When did Ricky Tiki leave this station?

[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:55.240]
Would you say

[02:24:57.600 --> 02:24:58.040]
Wow

[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:05.440]
I mean ballpark I'm not asking for a minute in the day like a 80s 70s

[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:09.980]
Oh, well, then that's possible 80s. I'm not sure

[02:25:09.980 --> 02:25:14.000]
Because I just was wondering when you started listening to FM for music and when do you feel?

[02:25:14.980 --> 02:25:17.960]
Did a m is the band listen music on lost its popularity?

[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:24.140]
When did you become aware of FM becoming available also during whatever would you say that FM became more popular than a

[02:25:24.140 --> 02:25:31.080]
I'm just wondering just wondering. I don't know. I would say like I don't know 70s

[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:35.240]
Okay, I

[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:37.320]
mean early 70s. I lived in Detroit and

[02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:40.720]
FM was already making a big impact in Detroit

[02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:50.420]
Trying to think of the underground station. It was really big and there were no recorded commercials on that station air every spot was a live spot

[02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:54.780]
What the hell was that station in Detroit somebody will remember

[02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:59.660]
Big big. I think Paul Winter had to show on that station, but nevertheless

[02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:05.020]
When you say 70s is when FM started to make it and of course once people heard out good music sounded on

[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:08.500]
FM as compared to a and they said oh, we don't want to hear a bunch of

[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:09.920]
On a I'm like that

[02:26:11.420 --> 02:26:14.300]
And that was the beginning of the end and then Joe Bell came to town

[02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:15.500]
well

[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:17.520]
speaks for itself

[02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:26.440]
Scott says gave you the day last week Prince spaghetti day being Wednesday the radio station in Bonair was transworld radio and they were on 800-910

[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:31.800]
You're absolutely correct Scott. That's why they interfered with CKLW because they were both on 800 on the dial

[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:38.080]
And CKLW was pumping out their legal 50,000 watts with a gigantic signal

[02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:41.080]
But if you were like in you know certain areas and

[02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:44.380]
Whether was the wind was blown in a certain direction

[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:49.880]
Bonair would interfere and you hear this religious crap over CKLW which really would piss you off, you know

[02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:53.000]
The big H

[02:26:53.620 --> 02:26:54.060]
Golden

[02:26:54.060 --> 02:27:00.400]
I mean I'm trying to you know, it's difficult to pick one

[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:07.180]
If you were to ask that question I think we've done that before pull question. What was the greatest AM station of all time?

[02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:12.000]
Yeah, well CKLW would have to be right in there a contender

[02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:19.160]
Oh definitely a contender and then there would be people who would say you know WBC KDK WABC 77

[02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:27.480]
What a signal they had like God can you imagine how many millions of people they were reaching with that signal at night couple

[02:27:28.700 --> 02:27:29.300]
3 4

[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:31.880]
Trillion three four trillion

[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:34.820]
So what's bigger elephant or the amoon oh

[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:38.240]
You got snuckered in on that you should check snopes. Oh

[02:27:39.180 --> 02:27:41.820]
You made a mistake you made who cares who cares

[02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:48.440]
Seriously if I had that much time on my hands that I was worried about nitpicking crap like that

[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:52.060]
I would I would definitely go to the balcony right now. It's a beautiful sunny day to jump

[02:27:55.100 --> 02:27:57.340]
And if you splatter it really don't matter

[02:28:00.340 --> 02:28:06.940]
Here's one this starts out very sad, but the end makes up for it and it's an attachment to something

[02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:13.140]
Starts out sad but makes effort. It's like some kind of an audio thing. I just deleted. Let me say it again

[02:28:13.140 --> 02:28:17.100]
I don't open the links and I don't do attachments. Okay period

[02:28:18.980 --> 02:28:21.300]
Oh God what part of that don't they get it

[02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:28.280]
Here's one from Frank about those hot chicks mentioned watch the movie havoc and you'll see more

[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:33.300]
What oh anathaway in a whole new light

[02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:36.960]
Yep, and you will move her to the top of your list and be sure Phillips

[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:43.340]
I'm so in love with anathaway says I make my woman wear a bride

[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:51.780]
Ride-war's poster when we have sex. What does that mean? I have no idea and he really spells where whre

[02:28:51.780 --> 02:28:58.040]
Oh, Teresa's back again stuff my grandson says he'd like to visit the state. He says he's emailed you before his name is Johnny

[02:28:58.040 --> 02:28:59.440]
John ZTR

[02:29:01.740 --> 02:29:06.060]
John ZTR is Teresa. Okay, you think there really could be anybody that's stupid

[02:29:06.660 --> 02:29:09.480]
Yeah, but no, it's John GTR. Yes

[02:29:11.340 --> 02:29:16.160]
Which is no surprise to me though that that's what I was thinking John pretty weak effort man

[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:19.540]
You know you know you start out really good and now you're slipping

[02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:22.380]
You like we got caught you're slipping

[02:29:22.380 --> 02:29:23.520]
For the

[02:29:24.820 --> 02:29:25.140]
Later

[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:33.780]
Jake me out to the ball game

[02:29:34.900 --> 02:29:38.540]
I want to see your marlins

[02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:49.200]
I'll have for love for an I run beer and pay 50 dollars to park my

[02:29:49.540 --> 02:29:54.820]
Here took some funds away from education

[02:29:56.500 --> 02:30:00.020]
To build a new stadium for the dumb

[02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:03.980]
But you won't seek no

[02:30:04.900 --> 02:30:07.560]
Monista ringos at the

[02:30:11.700 --> 02:30:14.960]
Game okay, so David emails and says

[02:30:15.480 --> 02:30:19.700]
Last night at the world baseball classic there were 13,000 screaming Venice Waylands in the rain

[02:30:20.260 --> 02:30:25.540]
These same fans come up with the excuse. They don't come to the marlin games because of even the threat of rain their copouts

[02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:30.900]
Why these 13,000 Venice Waylands and Puerto Ricans don't come out to a marlins game is amazing

[02:30:31.620 --> 02:30:36.780]
They support the world baseball classic rain or shine, but they don't support marlins baseball give me a break

[02:30:36.780 --> 02:30:41.400]
Says David another reason why we don't need that stadium because they're not gonna come build it and they won't come

[02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:45.120]
You believe it no

[02:30:46.280 --> 02:30:49.040]
Yes, you do you won't go no

[02:30:49.880 --> 02:30:50.660]
Well, why not

[02:30:51.620 --> 02:30:57.160]
What if they give you free food like you sit in the press box pay me and send a little and hang out with the what's his name's wife

[02:30:57.160 --> 02:30:58.820]
Then I'll think about it Dave and boring

[02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:02.840]
His wife hot that's what we hear

[02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:10.680]
He's not and she is he is so boring. Oh my god. I was just thinking about I heard clearance his voice to run at spot

[02:31:12.580 --> 02:31:15.600]
Yeah, and I was just thinking about him. I don't know

[02:31:18.700 --> 02:31:21.160]
As a as a person as a human being you know, I mean

[02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:23.820]
Yeah as a as a being

[02:31:24.980 --> 02:31:25.780]
as a being

[02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:30.560]
functioning breathing a kidney bean I just I just have difficulty

[02:31:31.080 --> 02:31:31.300]
being

[02:31:32.040 --> 02:31:32.900]
Coping with that

[02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:40.380]
Mark and Kendall says you read an email earlier from a guy whose co-worker came out of the closet his comment that he is still his friend reminded me of a similar situation

[02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:42.180]
Situation, I'm your friend

[02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:47.820]
I recently attended a family function of north and a family member of mine who I grew up with but only visit every now and again

[02:31:47.820 --> 02:31:50.620]
Pulled me aside and for me that a childhood friend of ours had come out

[02:31:51.720 --> 02:31:55.780]
After my reaction was yes, so he relaxed and proceeded to catch me up on his welfare

[02:31:56.900 --> 02:32:00.500]
I thought it was sad because I know my family member was torn is not a handle these situation

[02:32:00.500 --> 02:32:05.840]
And stated that one of the perks of hanging out with him was that the group that hang with get treated very well when they go to gay bars

[02:32:05.840 --> 02:32:09.420]
Because they hadn't turned their backs on a long time friend. Why do they go to gay bars?

[02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:11.440]
Why do straight people go to gay bars

[02:32:13.740 --> 02:32:17.300]
For the life of me I have never ever figured out the answer to the question is

[02:32:17.300 --> 02:32:24.880]
I was talking about a lesbian bar or a gay guy bar. I don't know if it's a gay guy bar. They don't oh

[02:32:28.380 --> 02:32:30.820]
I'm a devotee of Neil God on the DNH philosophy

[02:32:30.820 --> 02:32:33.140]
And think people need to stop being so stubborn

[02:32:33.140 --> 02:32:35.640]
Chances are they know someone who's gay whether they know it or not

[02:32:35.640 --> 02:32:39.580]
Chances are chance of large on a mattress the African queen. They're the one

[02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:42.240]
In closing, I'd like to apply to become your agent

[02:32:42.240 --> 02:32:45.280]
I have no experience, but figure that I could ignore you give you a

[02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:49.300]
Chromic contract sit back and collect your money for giving you some lip service every now and again

[02:32:49.300 --> 02:32:52.200]
Well, I'll put you on the list mark mark and Kindle

[02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:58.660]
Because my agent is just he's vanished into thin air. He's just uh, yeah, I'm not gonna call him. I'm not gonna email him

[02:32:58.660 --> 02:33:02.900]
And you want to know why you don't want to that's right. I don't want to waste my time

[02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:09.740]
I don't want to frustrate myself with just oh, but to be put a boop and boop and jose is this and jose that that but to be put a boop, you know

[02:33:10.440 --> 02:33:13.860]
Go play your fantasy baseball normal. Okay. Go pick up some runaways

[02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:17.040]
Gonna he leftover send one up here

[02:33:18.300 --> 02:33:21.460]
The internet could prove fatal the skinny Americans. This is a funny thing

[02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:25.980]
One of those angry letter to the editors was published in the March 16th edition of the hero

[02:33:25.980 --> 02:33:29.900]
The attributing the slow demise of newspapers to folly born out of liberal bias

[02:33:30.780 --> 02:33:37.080]
The minemakers writer said anything that does not you to the liberal politics or challenges the conventional wisdom doesn't get printed

[02:33:37.900 --> 02:33:40.420]
He wrote that as a newspaper reader for 45 years

[02:33:40.420 --> 02:33:44.060]
He had long taken his gospel most everything I read but long came the internet

[02:33:44.060 --> 02:33:49.160]
I found out how slanted some of the news is he then cited three examples of evidence for his thesis

[02:33:49.160 --> 02:33:52.800]
First he accused newspapers of printing news that supported the notion of global warming

[02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:56.840]
Opposing views are not aired even though there's a large body of evidence refuting this fraud

[02:33:56.840 --> 02:34:03.160]
He intimates that newspapers are behind the movement toward organic food while the department of agriculture can find no additional nutritional value in it

[02:34:03.160 --> 02:34:09.120]
And finally in most puzzling he charges newspapers with spreading around the idea that obesity is not healthy

[02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:14.500]
The ills of obesity get lots of ink while skinny people to die from heart attacks and diabetes he said

[02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:19.240]
Gracious takes the science supporting global warming is overwhelming and urgent and so frightening

[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:24.980]
Especially for low-lying islands or nations with arid climates. There will be nearly criminal not to report the unhappy consensus

[02:34:25.940 --> 02:34:30.340]
Just this week a scientific exhibition in the Arctic reported an alarming retreat of the great glaciers

[02:34:30.340 --> 02:34:35.760]
There remains a diminished minority among climate scientists who are not convinced that global warming has been caused by human activity

[02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:40.520]
But not the fact of global warming. I don't know how newspapers could dodge global warming

[02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:44.980]
Nor do I think newspapers can take credit or take the blame for their organic food movement

[02:34:44.980 --> 02:34:50.680]
I think the fellow from IMEsures can pin the blame for folks growing concerns about food additives and livestock hormones and pesticides

[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:53.260]
As much on the internet as the liberal news media

[02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:57.720]
Does he imply that conservatives like the idea of filming their children with preservatives and pesticides

[02:34:58.380 --> 02:35:01.460]
But fatties now that takes the 800 calorie cake

[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:07.100]
A not so very liberal outfitted the American medical association is worried itself sick over the obesity epidemic

[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.320]
Skinny people occasionally die of heart disease and diabetes

[02:35:10.860 --> 02:35:16.780]
Sure, but doctors liberal conservative and the utterly apolitical claim that excess fat increases the likelihood of premature morbidity

[02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:19.420]
I would say that algorithm russian limbo are at equal risk

[02:35:20.180 --> 02:35:24.080]
But the writer did eliminate however unwittingly the vagaries of the internet

[02:35:24.700 --> 02:35:25.740]
the vagaries

[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:32.000]
Where he sarnored where myth in fact and paranoid conspiracies and scientific findings get equal treatment

[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:39.100]
It's where George Bush mastermind denied 11 aware Barack Obama's a secret Muslim and the internet apparently is where skinny people go to die an early death

[02:35:39.740 --> 02:35:41.680]
Thank you cliff and candle good crap

[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:46.320]
Paranoid right wingers man so many oh see

[02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:47.780]
The builder burgers

[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:49.760]
The Illuminati

[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:55.380]
Wonder whatever happened to Shirley Spellerber. Hopefully she's dead by now. Yeah

[02:35:56.240 --> 02:35:58.260]
You don't know Shirley Spellerber. Nope

[02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:03.660]
Well, you didn't miss a thing right winger from Texas used to do the nights alternating with the Irv shinler

[02:36:03.660 --> 02:36:05.100]
Swiftie shinler. He's dead

[02:36:05.720 --> 02:36:08.940]
And if it's good enough for her, it should be good enough for that bitch right wing

[02:36:08.940 --> 02:36:15.960]
I wonder if Marba Studdley is croaked yet. Oh the Jewish people. I love my love. I love Israel. I just love. Oh my god

[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:19.660]
That whole deal she had going with Lucrone on W. Just knew to the most disgusting

[02:36:20.580 --> 02:36:21.020]
pandering

[02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:23.760]
Licking sucking. Oh my god

[02:36:25.140 --> 02:36:29.560]
The Jewish people I love my love my love they were planning to run her for office that bitch

[02:36:30.060 --> 02:36:32.480]
Really? Then a box of rocks

[02:36:32.940 --> 02:36:34.880]
Then an empty box of rocks

[02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:39.460]
Well, here's one from the fake time joker. Let's interject this for a moment of levity

[02:36:40.220 --> 02:36:43.920]
Steve Lapis whipped up about the opportunity of available radio free agents

[02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:49.920]
Steve is strongly considering hiring Sid Rosenberg and teaming him with Jeff DeForest calling the show two live Jews

[02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:55.180]
Jeff was not fond of the idea may take clear channels offered to do mornings in 940

[02:36:55.180 --> 02:37:00.720]
Steve is also considering Howard David from it days hang Goldberg to afternoon drive and fast Ed Kaplan for evenings

[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:06.260]
This will give the station an all Jewish lineup. Steve would love to have you once your contractors up with QAM

[02:37:08.220 --> 02:37:08.660]
Right

[02:37:10.060 --> 02:37:14.440]
Steve Lapis as Norma Kent once said and it's one of the few things he ever said that was true

[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:18.120]
Everything Steve Lapis touches turns to instant processed Schmidt

[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:23.780]
Oh, no, you're listening to Neil Rogers. Well, here we go again. I'm sounds for it is 20 years later

[02:37:23.780 --> 02:37:26.040]
560 QAM

[02:37:26.660 --> 02:37:31.380]
Yeah, get baby this portion of the show brought to you by Britney Spears but JJ

[02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:33.680]
It's hanging out y'all

[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:39.720]
All right, I wonder if it was hanging out to the air Canada Center last night or if it's gonna be hanging out tonight

[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:41.720]
Probably you're gonna be hanging out of the ACC

[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:46.700]
Sure, you'll be very pleased to know I got my shirt on my pantaloonies and my shoes

[02:37:47.380 --> 02:37:50.980]
All right. I mean all right shoes for old shoes

[02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:55.300]
Now let's see what is John ZTR have to say here something

[02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:02.860]
He says Neil it's true the quality of the fake emails are down. I mean way down. I rarely write it now

[02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:09.760]
I think I lost my drive however to restart car can't the only fake I emailed with today the other email was actually good

[02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:13.840]
He won't tell me what it was but the other one was actually good so he says

[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:15.700]
We shouldn't be for us to judge

[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:18.480]
Well, let's just take his word for it

[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:19.160]
not

[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:20.540]
What's not

[02:38:21.420 --> 02:38:22.020]
It's not

[02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:23.540]
It's not

[02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:28.540]
You think it's a fake email, but it's not

[02:38:29.980 --> 02:38:30.380]
Oh

[02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:34.480]
There he goes doing even more disgusting than eating on the air and now he's like snotting his nose

[02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:38.920]
Oh, then that's who it was that that's uh, that's the one

[02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:45.880]
About the eating on the aircraft right probably no for sure. Did I said bench me go or whatever that? Yeah

[02:38:45.880 --> 02:38:47.880]
That's John ZTR come on

[02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:52.460]
Somebody gets upset enough to write an email about eating on the air give me a breath

[02:38:53.600 --> 02:38:54.400]
Good god

[02:38:55.260 --> 02:38:58.580]
Wait to the year this speaking of breath you'll puke

[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:01.980]
Former evangelical pastor Ted Haggard and his wife

[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:05.420]
Are planning another TV appearance this time to talk about their marriage

[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:12.460]
The two are in LA taping an appearance on the syndicated 20th television show divorce court to be broadcast nationally

[02:39:12.460 --> 02:39:14.180]
April 1st no fooling

[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:20.600]
The shows presiding judge Lynn Toler is interviewing the couple about how their marriage survived after a male prostitute from Denver

[02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:26.560]
alleged a cash for sex relationship with that Haggard November 2006 executive producer Mark Coburg says

[02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:34.480]
The scandal prompted Haggard to resign as president of the National Association of Evangelicals and New Life Church in Colorado Springs

[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:40.700]
The Haggard say the marriage and Christian faith are stronger than ever and they want people to know that divorce is not the answer

[02:39:42.220 --> 02:39:44.820]
No finding a boyfriend for Ted that's the answer

[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:49.140]
This is part of Ted's journey gale Haggard said it's made him a better man

[02:39:49.140 --> 02:39:53.080]
I see what's happened as a divine rescue. Oh god

[02:39:53.760 --> 02:40:01.140]
She said she was helped through her darkest hours by the biblical principles of forgiveness compassion and steadfastness along with her husband's genuine repentance

[02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:07.760]
The couple will be paid and I'm just close to them off for the interview the latest in the series of public appearances that started in January

[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:14.300]
When Ted Haggard began promoting an HBO documentary the worst one of the worst pieces of swill I've ever seen about his time in exile

[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:20.760]
He's also appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show and Larry King live where he really got grilled and thrilled not

[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:30.700]
I wonder if he ever got as much tongue from his boyfriend as he got from Larry think oh Larry likes to get in his licks uh-huh

[02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:33.840]
Well

[02:40:35.100 --> 02:40:40.900]
That's also Cliff and Kendall. Thank you Cliff. Cliff is a filling Brandon shoes today sending some really interesting crap

[02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:45.300]
You got a few people out there that you know send us interesting crap

[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:51.800]
Good CJ who's becoming very chronic CJ from dear field beach

[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:56.100]
See when even you recognize some of the names that I know right now

[02:40:56.100 --> 02:40:59.900]
I know we're gonna have an additional spot on there today or not. I think not we didn't have anything written in

[02:41:00.780 --> 02:41:04.380]
No correct that really caught me with my plants down and they all over your mind

[02:41:04.380 --> 02:41:10.360]
You know I back time which is one of the reasons I play the same bits so often at the end of the show is because I got to find something

[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:14.480]
That's roughly like you know between a minute 50 and two two or five two ten

[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:16.300]
About a two-minute bit

[02:41:17.780 --> 02:41:23.080]
Now of course I don't have to start the break it to you know the same time. I could you know mix and match, but I don't want to

[02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:29.060]
We're just creatures are happy you know I'm saying oh if you don't want to take up any of the big old time oh

[02:41:30.020 --> 02:41:30.540]
Dewey no

[02:41:32.380 --> 02:41:37.940]
CJ says just wanted to write you and let you know that I can't stand what some of these right wing idiots say that vash are present

[02:41:37.940 --> 02:41:39.680]
But a beep but oh this is weak

[02:41:42.100 --> 02:41:47.240]
But a beep and tell clearance that just because he's getting married doesn't mean he's butching up anytime soon

[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:56.120]
Because once he's married he won't ever see his balls again. I think that's his balls. I don't know what I think she's gonna see him so

[02:41:57.120 --> 02:42:02.080]
Now why would you say something like that? You don't think he's screwing his brains out. I have no idea

[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:03.220]
with her

[02:42:04.180 --> 02:42:08.320]
I don't know I have no idea. Well, what do you mean with her with the beast?

[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:14.020]
The beast you know that that was practice practice makes perfect

[02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:21.340]
What's the wrong kind of practice or as they say directly practice makes prefect like no babies that way

[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:22.400]
really

[02:42:23.240 --> 02:42:25.500]
Really trust me. I know how

[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:28.560]
I

[02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:33.840]
Jane and dear field says I don't know if you mentioned it, but today is the sixth anniversary of the I may be mitigated disaster

[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:39.500]
That's the racquore. No, I didn't mention it because we're trying to keep happy today Jane. We don't want to get all morbid and depressed

[02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:43.580]
You want to get morbid and depressed? Yeah, sure. I don't

[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:50.120]
Although emails have made it easier to communicate with you at least an umscalcolors got you to read more bedtime stories

[02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:54.640]
Which the brain dead public needed to hear. Oh, yeah, they're really tuned into those bedtime stories Jane

[02:42:55.220 --> 02:42:56.020]
they're oblivious

[02:42:57.280 --> 02:43:00.480]
They're upset about AIG. They don't even know what the AIG is

[02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:05.100]
But they're upset about it. They're pissed off about those bonuses and they're pissed off about the bailout and yadda yadda

[02:43:05.100 --> 02:43:08.740]
They don't care about the racquore and all the dead soldiers and dead arachis. They don't care

[02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:14.980]
And that dog and pony show that bush put on that press dinner that night. Oh, no weapons over here

[02:43:14.980 --> 02:43:16.580]
You know making a joke out of it

[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:21.980]
Talk about an insult wow and the public is like oh, that was pretty funny George. Oh

[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:30.980]
It says I know yours is a fun show, but I think Americans should take at least a moment to reflect on the howling mob mentality that rusted into this horrible slaughterhouse or rack

[02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:37.460]
What what was the mob mentality was the neocons there was no mob it was a bunch of Nazis

[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:41.720]
I'm not see mob a small Nazi mob

[02:43:42.700 --> 02:43:48.820]
Of self-hating Jews all our dick chaniel at least a Jewish thank god all the dead and suffering not to mention our brave soldiers

[02:43:48.820 --> 02:43:50.580]
And either is a what's his name rummy?

[02:43:51.980 --> 02:43:56.580]
Been lawden city was gonna bankrupt us look how I looks like he understood America's general ignorance and succeeded

[02:43:56.580 --> 02:44:02.380]
Sorry for the downer love you jim do you feel no sorry left that to write about the end of the show I've had it for a while, but

[02:44:03.180 --> 02:44:04.140]
It's a downer

[02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:07.560]
John ZTR

[02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:13.500]
Isn't this something that we got a fake emailer who now communicates with us and tells us which fake emails he sent it

[02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:14.840]
They're really weak now john

[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:18.320]

[02:45:39.400 --> 02:45:39.880]
Maybe

[02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:45.900]
Here's this chronic phone number emailer. It's amazing how angloss are a two minority in Miami

They just voted in favor. They yeah, they'll pass. You'll see the dye is cast the fix is in

[02:46:32.620 --> 02:46:36.540]
That's how they slip through the metro rail the public voted against the metro round. They just fixed the vote

[02:46:36.540 --> 02:46:41.360]
They fixed the vote they rigged it. Yeah, I remember it was like yesterday

[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:45.900]
It was losing big time and then well when the vote came in from homestead

But my life in the past
