[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040]
For that reward, he even loves Neil Rogers.

[00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.540]
I'm gonna make him an opera again.

[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.900]
A rock!

[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.720]
We'll meet again if we don't want to die

[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.140]
From the bush cartel that left us all this way

[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.980]
Hoi!

[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.480]
We fall then to blind so cold it was our doom

[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.040]
As the bombs drop from the stars come far away

[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.900]
Gang rape is funny

[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.540]
Maybe we should have paid attention

[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.200]
A little bit more to the facts we chose to ignore

[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.780]
The price of galker's decal

[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.620]
But I'm afraid that the lime won't be very long

[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.720]
Tell us George

[00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.360]
We'll meet again with a hope that by then

[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.780]
Hoi!

[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.300]
Civil rights will be restored one sunny day

[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.620]
Hoi!

[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.880]
We'll meet again if we don't want to die

[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.840]
From the bush cartel that left us all this way

[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.180]
We'll meet again with a hope that by then

[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.600]
Hoi!

[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.160]
Civil rights will be restored one sunny day

[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.180]
Jesus Christ!

[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.660]
9.02.05.60

[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.840]
Nobody's QA, I'm happy you're Tuesday too

[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.420]
Well, quite a morning this morning already

[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.840]
I think we should go home right now

[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.100]
Complished so many things this morning

[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.360]
Mo and I had a bonding moment or two this morning

[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.680]
Oh!

[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.320]
That's correct, I went back on my ward

[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.140]
I said I would never speak to that creature again

[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.000]
And I came in this morning he was sitting in there

[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.100]
Where she seems to do a lot

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.280]
With Zach and Robert I think probably

[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.560]
Because other than Gildi nobody in the building will speak to him

[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.900]
But anyway he stays in there during the breaks

[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.200]
And as I'm coming around a corner there

[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.300]
He's waving at me like frantically like his long lost best friend

[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.080]
So being the old softy that I am I wave back

[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.020]
You know

[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.680]
About ten minutes later I go out to take a leak

[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.780]
And it's another break and sure enough he's sitting there

[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.480]
Again with Zach and Robert I think they got something going to three of them

[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.380]
And I come back he's waving again

[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.540]
So I like to take a look inside the window and I wave back

[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.280]
And I open the door because I hear him tortling

[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.040]
And I said what have I done to deserve a welcome like this

[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.960]
And that began a warm and fuzzy series of exchanges

[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.420]
The likes of which you've seldom seen

[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.700]
Then Gildi was the wanderer on the hall

[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.320]
Smell really bad I think Gildi I didn't realize it

[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.440]
There's one of his things that he's going to his functions in a morning show

[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.160]
He has to carry around most bag when most not in the studio

[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.380]
No seriously because something smells like death

[00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.520]
I mean oh good God Gildi

[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.880]
Maybe Gildi just farted

[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.400]
Or maybe he had like a float in his pants I don't know but good God

[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.960]
Huh?

[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.220]
Well you know when you're under the tremendous pressure that he is on that show

[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.740]
It kind of explains it to me

[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.320]
Huh? Maybe he's shm in himself I don't know

[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.440]
But it's a stunk I mean a stash like death

[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.360]
Or it could have been most peace you know it could have been that thing too

[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.160]
The dead muskrat on top

[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.340]
But we had a very very fine bonding experience this morning

[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.160]
Asked me about those you and baseball games

[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.120]
I guess maybe he's getting a little bit nervous huh?

[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.940]
And don't give me this Dave Ann Boring is great Gildi

[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.660]
Because Dave Ann Boring is just awful

[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.600]
He is to up and away

[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.560]
I don't want to get into the Marlon thing because it's part of the neurotic repetition

[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.040]
That is how Florida Bud

[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.560]
I had a spy report from one of our people that yesterday they didn't have programs

[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.000]
Because the place that made the programs had that was hit by the tornado

[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.540]
Oh but they didn't have the winters not enough to feed everybody

[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.520]
According to that Larry guy that called Mo on my way to work I heard that this morning

[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.080]
They didn't have enough winters for everybody

[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.800]
That's why 37,000 plus on opening day

[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.420]
Don't pee on their parade

[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.420]
And all I heard was negativity driving it

[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.640]
And about while Jeffrey Laurie is this and here's the interview with the mad dog yesterday

[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.800]
And he didn't say anything

[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.700]
I heard like nothing but negativity

[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.660]
I thought I was supposed to be the negative one right?

[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.860]
Negative, nearly, Nelly

[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.800]
But just an awful lot of negativity on that

[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.660]
And so they played a crappy game there's 161 more to go

[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.440]
It's part of the same neurotic repetition trying to force feed Hollywood to the herbs

[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.660]
They don't want it, they don't like it, they don't want to know from it

[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.600]
But see everything in San Florida has to be a soap opera

[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.640]
Other cities they have sports franchises that are successful

[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.780]
That are mediocre, that are not so successful, they have good attendance, bad attendance

[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.840]
And it's like you know that's what it is

[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.360]
But here everything is a soap opera

[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.840]
And it's just never ends, it's always the same neurotic repetition

[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.740]
And gee are they going to sell out? Well anybody show up? Does anybody care?

[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.200]
See the operative word is free

[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.200]
If they gave away some free crap every game

[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.740]
There would be a whole bunch of people there

[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.100]
They couldn't care less about the ballgame

[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.820]
In fact if George would know about the free winners you might have showed up

[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.560]
It's right down the street

[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.580]
That's right, actually we had a pass here at the station

[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.580]
Well there you go, you had a free admission and a free winner

[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.360]
What more could you want? No program because you don't care about that

[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.680]
A limousine ride

[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.080]
Then I would maybe thought about it

[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.560]
Carlos and his grand power there yesterday

[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.420]
And he's not showing up for work today

[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.700]
Called in his other obligations to take care of

[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.420]
He hates so many winners

[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.040]
Could have eaten not too many winners there

[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.620]
Too many winners is bad for it, that's what mode told me

[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.120]
1274 votes on our poor yesterday

[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.600]
Which of these best describes South Florida we asked?

[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.740]
1276 to be exact now

[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.660]
Banana Republic

[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.660]
470 out of 1276 votes

[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.980]
It's a banana republic, is it?

[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.400]
Yes

[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.880]
Intellectual wasteland 173

[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.640]
Land of Crooks and Schnooks

[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.880]
165

[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.880]
Land of Sun and Fun 123

[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.360]
9.6% sense South Florida is the land of Sun and Fun

[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.440]
Outdoor Funeral Parlor

[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.720]
109

[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.100]
Haven for rubber rafters 102

[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.800]
Magget Magnet, that's cited in vote for that but that is one of my favorites

[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.200]
I love that expression, my Magget Magnet

[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.280]
Michael Jackson, I see he's going to move here now

[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.580]
What I tell you, OJ Michael Jackson, it's a Magget Magnet

[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.640]
It attracts every low life piece of scum, every undesirable

[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.440]
Magget Magnet 75 and Paradise only 59, Maul

[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.040]
Jesus Christ

[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.900]
No, not too good

[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.360]
So Maul has a very small number of people out there who would agree with him that this is Paradise

[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.000]
Maybe it was that hair piece that smelled so bad

[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.560]
There was the odor of something in the hallway there, the legs

[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.800]
You have never

[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.180]
In your wildest nightmare smelled anything like that

[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.460]
Maybe it's our plum in

[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.680]
Again, is it because I don't know

[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.960]
No, I was in there, it smelled fun

[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.880]
I see

[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.760]
No, I was in there a couple of times taking a leak

[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.940]
In fact, I'm going to do that a lot more

[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.020]
In fact, I'm just going to go out there and pretend I'm taking a leak

[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.000]
And then come back so I can walk by and see if Moe keeps waving at me every day

[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.400]
How you doing, Moe?

[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.380]
You asshole

[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.720]
Anyway, here's our pool today

[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.500]
Oh, before we get to, well, I give the pool now

[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.380]
Because it'll allow Eric to put it on there

[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.580]
And then he can eat the rest of the morning unencumbered by obligations to do stuff

[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.740]
Here's the pool

[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.220]
And it isn't exactly what would Jesus do, but I notice in this letter to the editor that somebody sent me from Fort Myers newspress

[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.020]
Thank you very much, by the way, JR, whoever you are

[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.800]
There's a thing in there about what would Jesus do

[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.820]
Here's my question, how does religion permit the carnage of the war in Iraq?

[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.820]
The killing, the meaning, the bloodshed, all of these things

[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.840]
And I've got you six choices

[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.100]
God wants us to kill our enemies, there's choice number one

[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.400]
Choice number two, it doesn't, the Ten Commandments say thou shalt not kill

[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.100]
Third choice, itself defense of God will allow it

[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.580]
Fourth choice, religious fanaticism is at the root of the problem

[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.740]
Fifth choice, even the Lord loves needle Rogers

[00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.980]
I thought we just heard that

[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.800]
Jesus Christ, and last choice, God doesn't care he's busy with ball games

[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.340]
Which we've discussed many, many times all these athletes are always looking up in the sky

[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:14.480]
And there was the Lord done it and God, bababan, or praying to the God to be on our side and help them win the game

[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.600]
So God obviously is very, very concerned about point spreads and who's going to win the ball game and who's going to stay healthy

[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.180]
And who's not going to stay healthy?

[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.720]
All you athletes out there to get injured, like Derek Geter yesterday opening game for the Yankees

[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.520]
And he gets you to run off the bat

[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.680]
So to speak, and maybe he and the Lord have got to like commend their fences like me and Mo

[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.580]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:35.500]
Yeah

[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.300]
So there's your pull again, how does religion permit the carnage of war in Iraq?

[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.840]
God wants us to kill our enemies, it doesn't the Ten Commandments say thou shalt not kill

[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.880]
And self-defense, so God will allow it

[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:54.560]
Religious fanaticism is at the root of the problem even the Lord loves neo-roger's or God doesn't care he's busy with ball games

[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.000]
WQAM

[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.220]
Hey, you know, next speaker me right away

[00:08:59.220 --> 00:08:59.560]
Sure

[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.240]
I knew in this whole God crowd was fake because you knew what?

[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.280]
You knew what?

[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.480]
The God, the crowd people talking about how the players talk about God and everything

[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:08.940]
Yeah

[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:15.560]
Well, I knew a piece of crap when they said that he's everywhere and when they say he's everywhere at the same time

[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.440]
I thought about Santa Claus and everyone's Santa Claus

[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.880]
He's everywhere, he's everywhere

[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.160]
Yeah, he's everywhere, just like Santa Claus right?

[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:21.760]
Right

[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.200]
God kiss my ass

[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.740]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.900]
You understand that?

[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.320]
And they say God kissed my ass, and he say was that, was that, that's a Neil God kiss my?

[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.220]
I'm not really sure

[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.180]
He was kind of like a mumbling

[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.120]
Well, that's good though, we got a good, the first call to their get out of a system

[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.280]
New pool is up already, nice going to Eric

[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.440]
See when your fax Eric can pull like I do it about 7 30 in the morning, he gets it up there

[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.580]
And then he can like free to eat the rest of the day

[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.680]
Let's do the break and then we got some very important letters to the editor in response to that one for the first one of those three from last Friday

[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.900]
Thank goodness, by the way, that some people out there have the balls to respond

[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.060]
Because this is QAM where we have a little teeny tiny pair of them

[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.960]
We're supporting you 560, QAM

[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:13.160]
Just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just tell me what your problem is

[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.060]
Language tape number six

[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.700]
The convenience store

[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.620]
Follow along and repeat

[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.120]
Convenience store manager

[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.840]
Hello, may I be to help you please?

[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.780]
Repeat

[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.100]
Hello, may I be to help you please?

[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.040]
Customer

[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.020]
Yes, I would like a pack of Parliament lights

[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.780]
Convenience store manager

[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.620]
You wanna problem in late?

[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.600]
Repeat

[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.160]
You want a problem in late?

[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.160]
Customer

[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.460]
Yes, I would like a pack of Parliament lights

[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.520]
Convenience store manager

[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.300]
Uhh, this the Parliament Light

[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.280]
Repeat

[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.680]
This the Parliament Light

[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.220]
A, this one, Parliament

[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:57.320]
Customer

[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.560]
No, neither one of those is the Parliament light.

[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.720]
Wait, no, is it this one? No, it's not that one.

[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.860]
You want to Parliament light? Yes, I want the Parliament light, please.

[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.620]
Is it yellow heat? No, the Parliament light.

[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.660]
No, no, can't you see it's a...

[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.020]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, over there by the dirty magazines.

[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.160]
But can't you see it? Listen, Laundry Hand, it's the Parliament light!

[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.760]
Now, turn this tape over for language tape number seven.

[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.480]
Ordering Chinese food over the phone.

[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.720]
915 at 560 WDQ, I'm happy Tuesday.

[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.820]
So here's the fact that says George, can you have Neoplay convenience store Parliament lights operator?

[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:36.440]
Hey, Dean.

[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.980]
Should I play it? No. I guess I just did.

[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.480]
Couldn't find it on the web. Well, there you go.

[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.620]
We're like right on top of it today, baby.

[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.920]
Yeah, I want to lighten up a little bit.

[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.980]
Yesterday was very heavy duty and depressing.

[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.440]
And, you know, all needs to be said.

[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.620]
But I don't want to get like too heavily morbid and all of this stuff.

[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.040]
Because nothing I say is going to make a goddamn bit of difference.

[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.120]
Even though this is the only place in the universe,

[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.900]
and you'll find anybody saying these things except for what's your name?

[00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.800]
Who's in a dream world?

[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.940]
Just like Mr. Ego.

[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:06.080]
So we had a spy report moments ago, George answered the phone, which is a bad mistake on his part.

[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.460]
For some lady who said that Mr. Ego,

[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:14.200]
and his little cast of misfits, little Brian, and all the others, both of the others,

[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.360]
every time we do a poll having anything to do with the war, like today, I guess,

[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.960]
they creep the poll.

[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.640]
Okay, and of course we've noticed a tremendous impact not on those polls,

[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.360]
because with that vast audience that Mr. Ego's got,

[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.860]
first of all, the old cockers that are listening to the light bulb junior,

[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.060]
ultra light bulb, those people don't have computers.

[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.560]
Thanks Bob, there's Bob Eisenberg with my Halopaniac copy.

[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.020]
Thank you.

[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.220]
It's not.

[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:38.860]
Barbikis.

[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.780]
Well, where's my Halopaniac copy?

[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.520]
Bob Eisenberg?

[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.440]
It's the 1st of April, and that's the April Fool and Mr.

[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:45.600]
He better get with it.

[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.060]
You know, I'm going to talk about his hair piece again.

[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.760]
He looks pretty disheveled this morning, doesn't he?

[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.500]
Looks like crap on two legs.

[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.880]
I'm not confused with Mo.

[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.380]
Now, what was I just saying before he opened the door and interrupted our show?

[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.620]
Mr. Ego, Mr. Ego, creep and creep and those old cockers don't have computers anyway.

[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.580]
So he's obviously having a little or no impact, but if it makes you feel better

[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.220]
that you're involved with our programs, Steve, this is his way of trying to reach in

[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.580]
to like a real audience as opposed to like the point one or whatever they got over there

[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.260]
on light bulb junior, light bulb ultra light.

[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.580]
Speaking of Parliament lights, maybe that's what we ought to call,

[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.820]
do you think he's ever going to get over not being able to follow you?

[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.860]
Did you realize that I don't even know the colliders of that radio?

[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.360]
I don't even know if it has colliders.

[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.860]
Whatever that station is that he's on.

[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.620]
He's on the air.

[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:31.860]
Just barely.

[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.320]
I mean, if we're a radio-ish, what does that make them, you know?

[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.260]
21 quick votes on a pool there.

[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.460]
How does religion permit the carnage of the order rack like those seven women and children

[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.600]
that got blown up because they didn't stop at the checkpoint, huh?

[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:47.940]
10.

[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.360]
I beg your pardon?

[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.680]
There are two conflicting reports, but the latest...

[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.440]
Well, no, actually the one I got says that there were more than hell is it?

[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.860]
14? Right.

[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.340]
Seven of them were killed.

[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.460]
And then there were like three injured and then two that the...

[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.660]
I heard in another report that there were actually 10 killed.

[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.200]
I see.

[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.080]
So at seven or ten, take your pick.

[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.440]
It's just a more human life being wasted because of the fact that, you know,

[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.480]
the Bush-Chainy cartel has got to go in there.

[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:20.360]
And this is like I said, it's basically the only place in a world you'll hear anybody speak the truth on Radio or TV.

[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.660]
There's all the rest of propaganda.

[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.020]
They shouldn't have been doing that.

[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:23.780]
I see.

[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.500]
Anyway, don't get started again because then Mr. Ego will free-par pool.

[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.520]
It can't control himself.

[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.180]
I can't stop!

[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:29.500]
Yeah.

[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:31.760]
21 votes.

[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.800]
God doesn't carry his busy with ball games.

[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:34.220]
8.

[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.560]
Religious fanaticism is at the root of the problem of six.

[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.040]
Even the Lord loves Nearodgers 3.

[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.180]
It doesn't.

[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.340]
The Ten Commandments says, they'll shout not kill three.

[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.760]
God wants us to kill our enemies one.

[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.580]
And it's self-defense, so God will allow it as God.

[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:49.900]
Oh!

[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.720]
None so far on our very famous pool.

[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.200]
Come on, start that free-pin, Stevie.

[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.960]
Mr. Ego, get going.

[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.320]
Reach a real audience out there, which you're obviously not doing.

[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.480]
Stephen, his limming, his underlings.

[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.020]
Well, speaking of underlings,

[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.060]
our good friend, the mad dog.

[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:05.520]
Remember him?

[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:05.940]
Oh, right.

[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.280]
Really let us down yesterday.

[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.280]
Pretty wimpy, pretty wishy-washy if you ask me.

[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.300]
I challenged him.

[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.180]
I threw down the gauntlet.

[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.300]
I said, let's see what Mr. Mad Dog, this thing about any Jones in the

[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.780]
office protesting that we've got balls, QA and billboard.

[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.560]
We finally get some billboards.

[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.860]
The first time in five plus years that we've been here.

[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.200]
We finally get a little outside promotion.

[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.540]
Thank you so much, Greg.

[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.440]
Better late than never.

[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:27.940]
And what do we get?

[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.960]
We get a bunch of clowns out there responding to a miscreant,

[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.540]
which there are no words to describe.

[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.740]
Wacky, Jackie Thompson.

[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.560]
Why would anybody even pay any attention to him at this point?

[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:37.760]
Huh?

[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.680]
It's the right time for that.

[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.220]
I see.

[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:41.880]
I see.

[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.720]
I forgot about that.

[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.900]
But anyway, first down to Shalela, which, you know, we figured

[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:46.600]
why would a Shino.

[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:48.600]
Balls.

[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.840]
I mean, she'd probably never seen any anyhow down to Shalela.

[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.100]
But you of them, they got bent out of shape.

[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.760]
They wanted their name removed from that billboard.

[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.160]
They wanted her, she was a ball.

[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:56.620]
Okay.

[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:02.220]
Now any Jones in the dolphins is upset and wants the dolphin logo removed from that billboard.

[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.500]
The macho dolphins.

[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.180]
So I figured, man, dog being part of the dolphin broadcast,

[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.460]
being an ex-dolphin, Superbow Ring wearing dolphin, old number 88.

[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.460]
I figured he probably have something very heavy to do to say about that.

[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.800]
And so I sat here and listened for a couple of minutes and sure enough he did respond.

[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.260]
He says, well, Uncle Leo, blah, blah.

[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.540]
And it was like, whimpy.

[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.660]
You know, like, ah, geez, I mean, how could they be offended by something as silly as that?

[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.420]
And it was like about a 10-second thing.

[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.640]
And he just, you know, went zoom in right by and that was it.

[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.160]
I don't think that's an adequate response to you.

[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.240]
Now I understand he wants to protect his own little empire there.

[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.320]
He loves being the color guy in the dolphin game.

[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.860]
The audience loves having him there.

[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.120]
And I think it's great.

[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.280]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:41.840]
Oh, right.

[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.760]
But sometimes you've got to stand up and be a real man.

[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.600]
Be a real man as opposed to some of us, you know,

[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.800]
Kami Pinkofag, whatever the hell, dress wears.

[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:52.680]
Yeah.

[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:53.700]
Fakalous.

[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.900]
Yeah, things like that.

[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:55.700]
But you know, mad dog.

[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.320]
You're mad, I am a pussy.

[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.280]
And at least he admits it.

[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.380]
You know, he just don't have the balls.

[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.560]
So that thing about we've got balls at certain day parts on a station we've got balls.

[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.360]
Other day parts were just shields.

[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.960]
We're just shameless shields for the organizations.

[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.860]
And that's just the way it goes, you know, so I feel bad about that.

[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.960]
So anyway, before I get to that letter, WQAM.

[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.040]
Deal.

[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:18.600]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.820]
Actually, what he said was Uncle Neil Whiteen up.

[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.680]
He didn't say Uncle Neil Whiteen up.

[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:25.600]
Yeah.

[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.620]
No, no, no, he didn't know.

[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.300]
He didn't say that.

[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.980]
He was talking about the dolphins and the hurricanes.

[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.660]
I heard it.

[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.520]
Well, I thought he said Uncle Neil Whiteen up.

[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.820]
No, I'm already light enough.

[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.540]
Anyway, here's a, so Friday I read you those three letters today.

[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.540]
How do these people know I'm doing a screenwaste thing?

[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.320]
This is, this is, you think maybe we've turned the corner today?

[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.900]
I think most of you are so think that that bonding moment or two with more this morning

[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:52.260]
was the beginning of a whole new relationship with the audience with life in general.

[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.460]
Mark it down to, just marking it out of the counter.

[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.020]
See, they think it's an April fool.

[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.020]
Maybe that's what it was.

[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.420]
Got him, I slow him, I slow him.

[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.080]
Oh, what?

[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.140]
That must have been what that was with Moa waving and we had chatted a little bit and

[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.320]
that's how it's built it.

[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:12.660]
It says bonding moment, M-O-M-E-N-T-A bonding moment.

[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.480]
I think the audience isn't too happy about that.

[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.240]
I went back on my word.

[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:15.500]

[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:15.920]
Huh?

[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.040]
But you're not allowed to speak to him.

[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:18.320]
I know.

[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.300]
Under any circumstances.

[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.980]
I just thought it was amusing.

[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.460]
And he must figure in my old daughtering age, although I'm not nearly as old as he is,

[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:31.040]
but he must figure out I got Alzheimer's and forget about all the nasty evil things he's done to us and attempt to do and to where everybody else.

[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.280]
Lots of your back, Zack.

[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.080]
And then he goes in there and consorts with them.

[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.220]
That's the best part of the whole deal and he doesn't understand they hate him like poison.

[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.620]
Moa, you just don't get it, do it.

[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.220]
You're in denial.

[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.880]
Because the minute he walks out of there, they're making all kinds of cross the comments about him.

[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.160]
I shouldn't have said that.

[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.400]
Sorry, Zack and Robert, they love Moa a lot.

[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.320]
The Moa, they work with him, the Moa, they like him.

[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.120]
I'm just making that up.

[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:52.880]
I know you.

[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:53.640]
I must have means of that.

[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.500]
No, I mean the first part.

[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.140]
Which one am I making up?

[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.040]
I don't know. I'm confusing myself.

[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.380]
W-D-Q-I-M.

[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.880]
Good morning, guys. Speak to Neil.

[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:02.720]
Speaking, sir.

[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:03.960]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.620]
Good morning to you. It's half of the morning.

[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.420]
Half of the morning to you. You know Moa's listening. You know Goli's listening.

[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.120]
Please play a couple of seconds of your baseball play by play.

[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.300]
I don't have it.

[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.040]
I know you got it so far.

[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:16.660]
I got it so far.

[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.040]
I mean, if you'd like me to leave now, I can go home and search for some old cassettes.

[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.220]
I'd be delighted to do that.

[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.000]
I'll play some Philadelphia.

[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.340]
Do I have your permission to leave now?

[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:24.940]
Yes.

[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:25.880]
Okay, see you later.

[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:26.740]
Okay, sir.

[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.500]
Tell me no forbid some.

[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.580]
And what is that?

[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.020]
Let me just say this to you, okay?

[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.280]
I don't need to prove to Moa Howard-David or anybody else what a good job I did on

[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:37.920]
you in baseball.

[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.160]
I happen to be a very good play by play guy.

[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.860]
Also hockey, which he don't even understand what hockey is all about.

[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.140]
I'm a great hockey announcer.

[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.220]
But quite frankly, rather than compete with all the x-jocks to try to do play by play

[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.400]
and be a sports guy, I decided to do something else that I'm making a lot more money

[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.480]
than I would have had I tried to be a play by play guy.

[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.140]
See what I'm saying?

[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.220]
Well, no, what do you say?

[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.500]
I'm saying forget about it.

[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.480]
It's all in the past.

[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.560]
It's the ancient past.

[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.980]
And it's an ego thing with Moa, you know.

[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.960]
Oh my God, he might have actually been good at that.

[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.560]
That would be- that would bother him.

[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.440]
The fact that I would have been good at doing play by play.

[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.640]
That would disturb him greatly.

[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.180]
I know that.

[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.180]
And I know your list in Moa even though you lied and say that you don't.

[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.420]
On that long, long haul back up to Boka where all the old, old, farth slip.

[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.420]
Well, that doesn't count anyway.

[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.940]
Play by play baseball and hockey.

[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.600]
That's not like football, like a man.

[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.440]
Like a real man, right?

[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.180]
Who protested about the We Got Balls billboard.

[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:24.520]
Sure.

[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.200]
Real man like Eddie Jones, you know what I'm saying?

[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.040]
Hey Eddie, I think maybe you and Donna Shalayla got a lot in common at it.

[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.080]
Neither one of you have any balls.

[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.580]
Anyway, we'll get to these letters.

[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.920]
But I'm going to take a lot of calls here today because we're trying to lighten things up

[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.940]
just a little bit from yesterday when everybody was-

[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.440]
a little bit too intense, don't you think?

[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:40.860]
No.

[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:41.900]
I thought it was great.

[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.600]
No, I did, but I can't do that every day.

[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.580]
I'm going to have a nervous break.

[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.880]
Are you not going to change anything?

[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.060]
What am I going to change?

[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:48.940]
Intermittently.

[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.320]
Yeah, once in a great while when the mood strikes me because you know us here at QIM.

[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.860]
Jemandich, I am a pussy.

[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.540]
Yeah, we know that.

[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.780]
In fact, Eddie Jones probably has naked pictures of Mad Dog and Joe Rose at home somewhere,

[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.940]
which is why he just don't say too much.

[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.040]
WQIM.

[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.140]
Hey, Neil.

[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:04.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.420]
Absolutely love your poll today.

[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.840]
I was talking to a right-winger yesterday who tried to convince me with a straight face

[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.640]
that not only would Jesus be a Republican but he'd be a member of the NRA,

[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.280]
maybe in favor of the Senate.

[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.300]
Huh.

[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.580]
I always thought that the depictions of Jesus make him look like one of those hippies,

[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.140]
you know, like one of the peacenick kind of people.

[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.060]
Exactly.

[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:30.620]
And then I'm wondering, I'm wondering what the next generation of Army posters is going to come out where the Jesus

[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.860]
was a pointing finger we want you for the U.S.

[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.560]
I mean, with this current administration, how long can that be?

[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.680]
I can just see it.

[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.720]
I can see three of them.

[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.760]
I can see one of those billboards where like we got the one where it changes, you know.

[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.180]
And the picture starts out as Osama and then it turns to George W.

[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.980]
And then it's Jesus' head on the body.

[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.220]
Yeah, let's go kill somebody in the name of Christ.

[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:50.780]
What do you think?

[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.400]
There you go.

[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:52.580]
Yeah.

[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.580]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:54.740]
What do you say?

[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.360]
Let's go out and kill some people.

[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.600]
In the name of our good friend.

[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:00.340]
Jesus Christ.

[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.140]
Nice going, Neil.

[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:02.520]
Thank you.

[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.020]
I got a quick finger, baby.

[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.160]
Just ask Moe, he'll tell you.

[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.780]
Here's a fact that says, I don't know.

[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.920]
I just got a little bug up my ass today.

[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.200]
A little bug that is moe, don't get carried away.

[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.200]
What a homophobic asshole he is.

[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.180]
I mean, just obsessed.

[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:17.940]
I've said that time.

[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:18.180]

[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:18.280]
Huh?

[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.600]
Like Archie Bunker syndrome, you know.

[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.220]
Is that what an old fossil man?

[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.600]
Just a homophobic puss.

[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.140]
Lighten up a little bit more.

[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.980]
Okay, anybody that's been raped at it is many times by guys as you've been.

[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.420]
Well, they didn't have faggots in his day.

[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.020]
I see.

[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.220]
What's he smoking?

[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.760]
Here's the fact that says, I don't know if you've noticed that Phil Henry is a total right-wing asshole.

[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:38.640]
Are you sure?

[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.680]
That's what it says.

[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:44.440]
He likes to point out that he's a liberal who supports the war, but if you listen to him, which I've stopped doing,

[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.200]
you can tell just how much stardom has changed him.

[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.600]
He berates people who don't share his view of the war.

[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.420]
He does maybe one comedy bit on a show now, right down the crap, or it says.

[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.060]
I went to the PETA website, PETA.

[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.460]
I always call it that, but it's really...

[00:22:59.460 --> 00:22:59.880]
PETA?

[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.900]
And they have a picture of Moe on there.

[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.700]
It seems they're pissed about the skunk on his head.

[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.120]
Even skunks deserve better than that.

[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.000]
Yeah, it smells real bad, okay?

[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.800]
At least I think it was the hair piece.

[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.940]
Hey, I think it was guilty.

[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.100]
Maybe he was farting up a storm like you said.

[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:13.240]

[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:14.880]
Maybe it was his...

[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.140]
Heda.

[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.160]
20...

[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.820]
Maybe he didn't wash it.

[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.400]
26 past nine at 560 WDQM on a great Tuesday.

[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:25.900]
Oh!

[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.200]
Innocent men, women and children, little babies getting shot up and killed butchered.

[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.400]
And America's going around.

[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.980]
Yeah, we're number one, baby.

[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.060]
USA, USA.

[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.120]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.600]
What do you say, USA?

[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.760]
And like this, Lansky said, all the God squat out there,

[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.320]
oh yeah, Jesus would be a card-carrying member of the NRA.

[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.340]
He'd be out there shooting up a bunch of...

[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.180]
...smok to heads and he'd be a kickin' ass.

[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.900]
See, like, did I say that yesterday, religion and this whole thing?

[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:51.700]
There's no difference.

[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.540]
Same thing.

[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.940]
And, well, it's not the Shiites.

[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.520]
It's the Sunnis and no, it's the Kurds and the North and no...

[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.800]
And it's all...

[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.960]
It's like that thing out of a Monty Python, you know?

[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:01.480]

[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:05.580]
Which...

[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.000]
What's the bad one?

[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.760]
Which one is the bad one?

[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.340]
Is the all-onsar Islam?

[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.500]
What, which one is it?

[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:16.580]
And now, of course, we're frantically screwing around trying to make the connection between the Akhada and Sodom.

[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.280]
Frantically.

[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.460]
He or until...

[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.900]
Wouldn't you think we'd have done that before?

[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:24.420]
Shut up.

[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.380]
I just mentioned that in passing, father Pironoia.

[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.900]
I watched that again on DVD.

[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:32.480]
Yeah.

[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.460]
And it's got all the other, the extra scenes in it and everything.

[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.720]
Like when Linda Blair comes back, we're down the astereus and her head spins around.

[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.740]
Have you ever seen that with the extra scenes in it?

[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:41.980]
Yes.

[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.040]
I love it.

[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:50.980]
One of the great movies in a history of mankind, boys and girls, if you're wondering about all these grotesque things that are going on in the world today, get the exorcist.

[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.480]
That the power of Christ compels you.

[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.660]
The power of Christ compels you.

[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.760]
The power of Christ compels you.

[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.380]
28 past nine at five sixty WQA and hey, you know, this copy that Todd Dreck has got here for Fast Train is unacceptable.

[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.440]

[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.580]
You're a piece of crap, man.

[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.920]
You're a piece of...

[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.080]
Dreck.

Greetings for the last book!

[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.620]
Yeah, I know what that is!

[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.820]
Sure, good afternoon, yes.

[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.340]
Watch your back, the pack, where you won't wait for more.

[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.760]
Watch your back, the pack, where you won't wait for more.

[00:26:54.360 --> 00:27:02.180]
Oh, brother, all that blah, blah, I don't understand.

[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.240]
You can eat from a trough while you're in both ends.

[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.960]
That big fat patch you made a raining school.

[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.700]
You just like cleaning it all your thoughts.

[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.740]
And a straight dip, fat ass out.

[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.360]
Well, we'll take the food outta your mouth.

[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.760]
That's right, punch it back, fat ass out.

[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.180]
You won't wait for more, no more, no more.

[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.440]
No way, no way, no more.

[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.220]
Catch it back, fat ass out, what your own mouth is for.

[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.480]
Oh, no more, no more.

[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.880]
This is what we say!

[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.540]
Make it back, fat ass out.

[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.320]
You won't wait to more, no more, no more.

[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.380]
When you're back, fat ass out, what your own mouth is for.

[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.640]
Who am I?

[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:50.560]
I'm 30 to 560 wqa and here's a fax all the way already know about this thank you US troops made boot rvera

[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:57.440]
The Pentagon I thought they already got him out of there and then he claimed that he's more inside than he was before

[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.940]
They's moved to a different location and he's got to and anyway

[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:05.820]
It's kind of ironic because Fox News Channel is who he's working for and they were calling Peter our net a traitor

[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:11.220]
And just excoriating having an interest breakdown by the way Peter our net was hired by the British newspaper the daily mirror

[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.860]
I just thought I mentioned it and passing

[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:19.420]
But Fox who's on it with a Peter our net story about how we got came by MSNBC and by a national geographic and

[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:26.420]
Their own reporter herald a rvera may have endangered troops by drawing a map in the sand at detailed where the 101st Airborne Division was

[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.360]
Which was he was traveling wasn't embedded, but he was traveling with him in Iraq

[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:38.020]
How do you like that CNN MSNBC reported that river was being kicked out of Iraq. He says it ain't true. He says he's still in there

[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.520]
He said he tied a yellow ribbon to an old oak tree and

[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:46.900]
And then Tony Orlando are bonding you ever see them together same person right same person

[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.200]
Only Tony's got a little bit more of that good old time religion

[00:28:50.740 --> 00:29:00.020]
We're looking today for the answers on how God and Jesus and all of us other how they permit this carnage this grotesque crap all of this bombing and innocent people on all sides

[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:07.540]
Dying having their lives stuffed out having their limbs blown off. He likes it. Does he like it? Yeah, he liked it in the Bible in the good book

[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:11.380]
I'll tell you that he liked a lot of that stuff kill them all don't leave one standing

[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:20.100]
WQ I am yeah, Neil yes, sir good morning. Good morning to you know, I so curious happened to me this morning chronic

[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.540]
Did I talk to you yesterday?

[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.580]
Yeah, no, no, no, have a nice day

[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:30.080]
I mean, he's a good guy. I like him. He had some interesting stuff there yesterday about

[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.760]
GR which it took me I was thinking about that George Rodriguez

[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.660]
He just doesn't realize you spell it with a Jake right? He's he's probably reacon or something

[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:44.620]
No, no seriously, that's what you're talking about. I know you in Carolyn were that tight, but he's the guy to call this yesterday with a little

[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.500]
personal tidbit and

[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:47.780]
anyway

[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:54.120]
Well, what is wrong with you? Why are you like hyper ventilating in there? He's that's the guy in my I know my voices man

[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.300]
The temper and the fact that we like him a lot sir

[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.580]
Don't take it personally unless you want to your great guy used to be a wonderful caller

[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.600]
But the two days in a row is a no-no even though you know and I get a whole lot of action on it

[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:09.340]
That's okay because I feel a lot better today after my bonding with Mo and that's no April fooling

[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.180]
No, it was just it was like I told you as it was surreal

[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.660]
It was just I walked in the door and I look in there and he's like waving at me like

[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:21.660]
frantically like hey, how you been like he knows I've been here for a few days

[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.460]
Maybe it's national brotherhood week. Is that what it is? Oh

[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:29.800]
He said everybody hates the fags or something like that is that what by everybody hates Jew

[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.920]
Oh, I see is that include him? I wonder if that the raccoon on this head. I wonder if that thing is Jewish

[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.780]
It's kosher. I wonder if it's circumspect so anyway last Friday

[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:45.640]
There's three embarrassing letters to the editor ripping the protesters the anti-war protesters in the herald including one by

[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.560]
Alan Savitz and Coral Gables who says if we allow freedom of expression during a war will result in the deaths of many good Americans

[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:56.560]
So anyway, I was read that a couple of times. It was outrageous and in this morning's herald finally no April fooling

[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:04.920]
In this morning's herald here are two letters Jason in Weston says shock and awe is what I felt reading Alan Savitz's March 28th

[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:10.540]
Liter protest protested. I can't believe that an American citizen would put forth an idea that

[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:18.920]
Law should be enacted limiting freedom of expression under any circumstances much less support the thought that opposition to a war should be considered an act of treason

[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:26.060]
Consider two countries Iraq and pre-World War two Germany under this view will all start goose stepping and towing the party line

[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:31.680]
What's the majority has it say that that there's no room for the centers does or well come to mind?

[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.840]
Yes, the American flags still wave for all of us just because many people questioned the justification for this war

[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:43.840]
Doesn't mean that we don't support our military forces in love our country well said Jason in Weston. I like that part about goose stepping

[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:56.000]
Sarah and Miami Beach rights Alan Savitz accuses anti-war protesters of treason the U.S. Constitution explicitly defines treason as consisting only in living war against the U.S

[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.260]
Or in adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort since the anti-war protesters are not engaging in any of the above activities

[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.040]
They're not committing an act of treason

[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:11.180]
Furthermore, their right to assemble is protected by the first amendment which doesn't include any conditions prohibiting freedom of expression during wartime

[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:16.500]
Anti-war protesters have every right to protest the word that they believe is wrong even when the war is already underway

[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.740]
Being against the war is not equivalent to being against American soldiers

[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.220]
I have the utmost respect for America troops have mar them greatly however

[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:28.640]
I'm also against the Iraqi war nice going Sarah and Miami Beach very simple very common sense makes all the sense in a world

[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.820]
But people like Alan and the Gables though continue to write this swill this garbage

[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:40.880]
Let's just give up all of our rights and just dummy up and goose step in line as Jason said. Let's all of goose step and the answer is

[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.080]
No, we're not gonna go step. How do you like that? Huh? We're not goose step and baby some of us

[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.640]
Whether all these right wing Bible thump and hypocritical assholes like it or not

[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.200]
116 votes on the pool how does religion permit the carnage of the war in Iraq?

[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.720]
Religious fanaticism is after root of the problem 62 take that and stick it in your pipe and smoke it mr.

[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.240]
We go you jackass

[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:09.860]
You pathetic thoney baloney goofball. Hey, just wait till he mobile all phony body parts

[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.800]
Seriously, can you name me one part of his body? That's the original

[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:18.460]
I don't like them. I think that might be it. I bet you maybe he's even got a phony ass. You do that inventory

[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:20.540]
I don't want to I

[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:25.860]
already smelled some bad crap this morning in the hallway. We could ask Brian was it was it most rigor was in his a bag

[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:29.340]
Or was it just guilty drop the pitch to open his pants?

[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:30.580]
huh?

[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:35.320]
It was something man

[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.860]
Something really stunk out there in a hallway by guilty

[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.420]
Peta

[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:46.840]
66 say religious fanaticism a guy doesn't carry his busy with ball games 27 of you said that and of course

[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.760]
This is a sports station so an expense to me

[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:55.040]
All you jackass jucks out there pointing up to the sky and

[00:33:55.040 --> 00:34:01.240]
All I did it he helped me make that great play that great catch that great running what a what an embarrassment, you know

[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.180]
How is it that people watch that crap and they're just not nauseated by it?

[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.820]
Yeah, I mean I realized you don't watch any because you don't watch ball games

[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:15.280]
But even if you did to see some a little bit more on point. I was speaking of a little bit more on skipping just walked in

[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.200]
Oh, there you go get weathered skipping and by the well

[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.480]
Tell Bob Eisenberg that if you don't get me that new hallowed copy in the next hour or two that we're gonna rip him an ass

[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.680]

[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:11.580]
Oh God will allow it to and last and the least also with two God wants us to kill our enemies

[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.700]

Bastion

[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:10.940]
Why don't you go back to Canada you too fast? I might have to because at least my equipment up there works

[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:16.880]
You know, I noticed again during that bit just like yesterday we had some noise and now you think it's possible because I'm not really all

[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.120]
Familiar with what the maintenance on CD players

[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.340]
But isn't there a thing where you have to clean like the eye

[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.860]
Sometimes it can get on a line

[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.320]
What guilty I think need to do this one clean the brown eye

[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.300]
The leg is get dirty the what the lens the laser lens right

[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.160]
I think our lens is dirty. Holy well

[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.180]
He was in here asking this morning as he always does every morning as everything working okay

[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:43.340]
And I'm mistakenly I said yes because I thought it was a dirty disc yesterday. Why don't I call book a bride and have him um

[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.180]
Bring a when he brings his disc. Yeah

[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:47.660]
I

[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:48.820]
To reburn those

[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:54.040]
Let's see if that makes a difference. No, no, I but I well, why would it make a difference? I've played you and understand

[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.860]
Oh, this isn't a new disc. I play this is a zillion times all that disc and it sounded just fine

[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.660]
So obviously it's a it's a

[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:07.280]
Denon problem. It's an equipment problem equipment problem. A QA was like saying hey, guess what the sun is shining in Florida

[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:13.860]
You know, it's just part for the course. I may have to go back up there and you know risk my health with that SARS epidemic

[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.340]
Up in Toronto and Hong Kong and all around the world a strange

[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:18.380]
Pinomonia

[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.460]
It's not really all that bad, but people get freaked out. Yeah, right under one with mask on their push

[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.820]
Let's see here's the facts from oh there's who they all see he's right on top of things

[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:34.340]
Did you hear what I just said or did you just wander in now? Is it possible that the index that is because this is not the same when we had the problem yesterday

[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.500]
It was the upper one. Do they get like dirty? Is there something that needs to be different disc?

[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.400]
Not a bokeh Brian disc because he burns those at home, you know

[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.960]
You don't understand that discs don't degrade. Yeah, sometimes they do

[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.980]
Sometimes they can that short of a time

[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:55.940]
It's a breath. What's the date on this disc? It's only like about a month old the date is like well

[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.400]
You don't put the date on here because you're a puts yeah, it's like from the last month

[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.680]
It's like from March of 2000 tree mister try a

[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.540]
Factory disc

[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:14.260]
Jesus god almighty what is wrong with this man, huh? We still have such a classy show until this little bastard got involved in it

[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:22.160]
Of course, that was a long time ago. I've had homemade discs degrade on me. Okay. Well, let's try to clinton and dole on 60 minutes one

[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.360]
They can't degrade that badge they can maybe you can cheap crap

[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.580]
Here we go

[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:33.320]
60 minutes takes two former rivals and we can doles the claim

[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:37.940]
It's Quentin versus the point counterpoint month 60 minutes

[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.920]
I'm a lover not a fighter. I'm a lover too. I just need a little help

[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:48.160]
We need to political combat and square off nothing is out of bounds

[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:54.020]
Your life's fat. Hey, that's out of bounds nothing's out of bounds didn't you hear him just say that?

[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.200]
What? Clinton and dole on the economy more

[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:02.720]
The environment and Joe millionaire. I would not have pigs or a no-kin

[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.620]
Everyone knows your marvelous swear

[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:11.780]
Gulp gulp kind of guy Clinton and dole point counterpoint. I will open up a can of whoop ass on you Bob

[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:15.860]
I'll kick your butt with one hand bill, which is a good thing. I guess

[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.740]
Clinton and dole 60 minutes this spring

[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:23.040]
So you think that the book of rhymes this are degrading?

[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.580]
I've heard it said it has something to do with the burn rate

[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.320]
I've heard that they're humiliating and degrading

[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.900]
Especially that condolese one. That's what I heard. Wow

[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:38.060]
So that one sounded okay, and that was a factory thing if you use a fast burn rate

[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:42.420]
I've heard it said you increase the tendency that the disc will degrade well

[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:48.500]
Excuse me, okay. Well, if that's the case. Let's play another cut from the same disc because if the disc is degrading

[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.760]
Wouldn't they all be screwed up?

[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:55.000]
It stands to reason since you're the expert so they are standing like our tumors, huh?

[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.920]
Let's listen a little bit of this

[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.640]
If you'll ever play come on already. I think right graded

[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.120]
Right

[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:09.520]
Brian brother

[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:15.920]
One extra in okay, what I shmup burn them in real time Jesus Christ

[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:23.960]
Is that embarrassing or what? I'll call them now. Yeah, call them up and tell me's an idiot. Oh, he's listening

[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.480]
Tell me's a little lemon don't make him feel like all depressed though

[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.960]
I know don't I do that 179 votes on the pool

[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:35.420]
So thank you, Julio for being caring enough to send you very best, but it's us as usual

[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:38.800]
It's us worse screw it. It's Volka Brian not us. He's an idiot

[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.420]
What is he doing is he using this one that the struck like I'm mission impossible after you listen to the city

[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:47.540]
Mr. Feltzer will solve the struck is that what he's doing

[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:52.560]
Maybe he's using his backup computer. Yeah, maybe he's backing it up. Nobody Q. I.m

[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:58.300]
Hey, no, yes, sir. Oh, how you doing? Okay, great show. Yes, they was dynamite. It was sensational man

[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.860]
But we don't want to do that too often. I you're getting too old for that

[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:06.100]
Do it more often. Hey, I heard you ripping on how it turns on yet today about him

[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.200]
Being on the right wing side. Yeah, okay

[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.540]
I wonder where his fans was going to be if not one

[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:17.900]
I don't know he wasn't on the air during the Vietnam war. Yeah, and then did he um in list on the

[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:21.520]
Sir, let me ask you why why are you asking me this though? I mean what I don't understand

[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.320]
I just don't I just don't get him you know at one moment

[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:29.200]
He's um supposed to be peace loving on guy next minute. He's gonna be on their side

[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:35.400]
Well, I mean he just evidently has joined the parade everybody sold out Phil Henry and the Howard's during everybody was supposed to be cutting

[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:40.200]
Edge counter culture a real uh, you know radical and all of a sudden they've go step into the line

[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.680]
I don't get it

[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.500]
Pretty scary though, isn't it?

[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:51.880]
Okay, thank you. I mean I guess I'm the only guy who's stupid enough to keep you know, uh swimming upstream climbing up hill

[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:57.680]
Fighting against the tide all of these other stupid cliches. Maybe you have a conscience

[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:03.040]
That it's got nothing to do with that. I don't I don't ever come on here and give opinions based on what I think is gonna be popular

[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.240]
Good god almighty

[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:10.080]
You know the the eightiest Jew Fag. I mean forget about that react, you know

[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:14.800]
In fact, maybe we'll do the board again Christian thing didn't work too good for mr. Ego though all that pan

[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.720]
It's easy to be working too good for him and it was ten old Yenthas. He's got

[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:24.640]
Freep my pull my ass Steve. What are you kidding? Oh, hey, let's go to the computer and creep Neil Rogers pole

[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.520]

Thank you for the west Palm Beach, but I want to read it on here because we don't want to do a lot of marlin stuff here

[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:42.980]
I think mo and gildy cover that very very well in a great length this morning, you know, what else is there to say?

[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.280]
But he did the the facts you does have a good point

[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:51.100]
They had a suit. I mean the game stunt they you know give a bait runs early, but they clawed their way back made a game out of it late

[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:56.400]
When everybody was gone, but the point of the you know, at least they're making some kind of an effort is what he says

[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.360]
I uh remain I mean I'm yet to be convinced okay because this outfit

[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.980]
I think they're still just biting their time until they have to move the franchise in a couple of years

[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:10.360]
And a lot of people are just getting sucked in by the free winners, you know anything free bobble head dolls works for the panthers

[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:16.860]
Feel that play. Oh, it's a free bobble head doll. Let's go daddy, you know, free pins right ball cap day or whatever it is

[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:23.420]
This is a great time for giveaways man. You got something free just like this show out you watch all the people are gonna be calling in for free marlin tickets

[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:32.240]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line you mark my words man

[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.280]
They'll be lined up from here to Wokit Choby

[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:39.140]
All right now we only got one more on screen with some pretty depressed about that WQ AM

[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:45.900]
Neil yes sir hey I'm in here in Lake Worth how you doing to that you're in Lake Worth you don't sound old enough to be in Lake Worth mister

[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:50.580]
I know hey you know um I heard you mentioned Phil's name yeah

[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:57.140]
I'll tell you what man he's got to have the rush limbaugh blow up doll going. Yeah, but wait. Yeah, but wait a second

[00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:01.060]
He has taken so many steps to the right. It's unbelievable

[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:06.940]
It's unreal. Yeah, I mean and not only is he pro war but those of us

[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.580]
The pos it he

[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:15.000]
Just ridiculed us and and he just thinks that we're anti-American and this and that he's unbelievable pretty stupid

[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.040]
I thought that he was a pretty sharp guy, but I mean

[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:23.380]
And again, I don't think he really believes that I think he's probably saying it because of the fact that that's the clear channel company line

[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.860]
And he wants to be you know

[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:28.460]
He wants to be on the side of Fox News and all these other right-wing assholes

[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:31.260]
Hey, you know you brought up your point today about the

[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:37.660]
Religion and if it had anything to do with the war. Mm-hmm. They had a um I was watching world news last night

[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:41.760]
And they actually had bush on September 16th of 2001

[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:47.300]
Stating that the United States was going to undertake a crusade. Yeah

[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:54.280]
And the whole gist of the thing was whether or not the Christians were going to have a crusade against the Muslims

[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:59.100]
You know this whole thing now. I mean, I'm sure you've been watching the news as much as the rest of us and you've seen

[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:03.180]
People from Syria lebanon they're coming in by the bus loads

[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:07.860]
You know, they'll do anything for Allah. They're pretty good. They said they got five thousand them

[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:13.300]
So the Iraqis claim five thousand of these that would be a suicide bombers who want to go up their lives for a long

[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:19.240]
It's not off. It's not it's gonna be just like the Israeli

[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.620]
Palestinian issue. It's never gonna stop

[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:26.300]
Well like uh, Hosni Bavar from Egypt said yesterday said first we had a one-bid Laden

[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:30.420]
Now with thanks to this we're gonna have a hundred of them. I got one question for you. Yes, sir

[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:35.680]
We'll happen first and then to the Iraqi war or a Panther home win

[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:43.080]
We'll do a pull. I love you. Thanks, pali. Bye. Let's do a pull that'll make more happy is all bent out of shape about our pull

[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.800]
And then he has to spell it out home a phobia man

[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:50.140]
Everybody who points to fingers everybody who's worried about everybody else's who they're sleeping with to me

[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.620]
Those people are all a little bit suspect you catch my drift

[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:56.660]
No, I'm hit and of course keep in mind these sports guys who look to hang around the locker room a lot

[00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:00.600]
I don't know. I'm just I'm just thinking out loud at this point. I'm not making any accusations

[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:04.640]
I'm not pointing the finger at anybody other than clearance, but other than that what

[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:12.180]
Oh, Clarence still had a big smile on this push today. He's still pleased about that. Welcome close to personal encounter. He had with the beast

[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.880]
Always said he wish the beast would shave a little bit his breasts

[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:24.040]
Whatever was that he had contact with he wish he'd shave it his legs are out here. This is WQM where we have balls

[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:29.200]
By the way in spite of what Eddie Jones and what's your name? Donish and Shalali think

[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:34.040]
And wacky Jackie we don't give a crap. Okay. How do you like that? We don't give a flying crap

[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.180]
Greg read finally grew a little tiny pair just when he didn't think of what happened

[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:43.720]
And he finally said hey, we'll find out who really has the balls he said nice god air Greg. It's about time. Oh, Schmuck

[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.160]
957 at 560 WQM what's the schedule for today?

[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:54.600]
Neal since you always do such a great job of promoting everything and everybody on the station including even Mo and Gully and Mo Bandi

[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:56.940]
Jim Madd is your one

[00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:02.920]
Jim Maddog in the building I dare him to come in here and look me in the eye and say he didn't adequate job

[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:06.920]
I mean I realized it's not something if they spent a lot of time on especially he was out at the game yesterday

[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:13.080]
Trying to get a big crowd which they had thousands of people walk up you know by the tickets. That was good. They heard there was a free weeny

[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:19.280]
But now today that he's in the studio no excuses. Okay. I want to hear at least 60 seconds. I'm gonna get up to stopwatch

[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:26.420]
I want to hear at least a 60-second die tribe about how Jewel and Isle and Childish and embarrassing it is for the U of M and the Buch Miami dolphin organization

[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:29.580]
To be upset about us having a billboard that says we got balls

[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:36.120]
Talk about humorless talk about tragic talk about pathetic, huh? You know what I'm saying? Oh right. Yeah, so get with it mad dog

[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.420]
Quit being a pussy

[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:44.340]
At three o'clock we got Hank Goldberg from Vegas. Thanks got a better gig than I got he's not only see all over the place

[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.840]
But he's in places where he loves to be

[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:49.300]
He's a winter sports book right now plunging his guts out

[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:52.080]
Well probably not at seven o'clock in the morning. He will be

[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.740]
630 got the shittacle panther preview seven o'clock tonight the panthers at the Washington

[00:51:56.740 --> 00:52:02.300]
Capitals another road game although the caps are really desperate to win that game because Tampa big out of tie last night with the Bruins

[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:07.060]
How about the ranger Atlanta game last night? Ain't by see that no wow what a game

[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.900]
Those trashers look out for Atlanta next year in NHL. They're gonna be something

[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:12.280]
They are really exciting to watch

[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:16.780]
But the panther the arranger did get one desperately needed point. They still don't look like they're gonna make the playoffs

[00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:22.300]
To which we say oh good any cave to the panther hockey game in Joe and Mark overnight

[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:29.060]
To spew a bunch of anti-war propaganda now. What's their take on the war by the way? Do we know I I I

[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.460]
Don't want to say

[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.480]
Still reluctant about buying a bed over the phone

[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:49.160]
Don't be you can lie in bed on a real comfortable mattress listening to the Joe and Mark overnight show between two and six and just throwing things at the radio

[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.880]
When you call Donald mattress. That's how I've been doing it

[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.760]
Donald mattress carries only the best in the business

Way to A.M

Immaculon this is Joe ball in the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority Neil God

[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:10.340]
If you watch only one reality show this season

[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:15.420]
You'll want to watch the show where the kids finally get into the action tonight on Fox

[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:24.380]
The premiere of touched by an American idol young boys from all over the country will compete for the affection and fortune of American icon

[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:25.640]
Michael Jackson

[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.700]
Touched by an American idol. What's it doing now?

[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:37.280]
This is called growing and changing its reality TV like no other and you get to vote on who gets the sleep in Michael's bed

[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:43.460]
Honestly touched by an American idol Tuesday night at 10 on Fox. What's wrong with sharing alone?

[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:44.960]
But I don't want to share

[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:49.760]
10 out to a 560 WQM happy Tuesday to it some very bizarre factors here

[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.700]
That's pretty unusual in it. No

[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:57.380]
It says from Steve it says first time a fact or long time listener. I'm on AOL

[00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:01.160]
It's the worst in this week AOL put you on their not recommended website list

[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.180]
You following that? No

[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.940]
Who you talking to book a bride?

[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:10.040]
What time together time to get his act together. Okay and quit to giving us these degrading

[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:13.500]
Pieces of materials burning one now. Yeah, that's it is burning one

[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:18.880]
Not case AOL this week put you on their not recommended website list. I don't know what that means

[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:22.460]
Huh? It says and then trying to get to your side. I got these responses

[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.480]
Which I don't know what that means thought you'd like to know

[00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:28.340]
And it's just I don't I don't know what that means

[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.860]
Fox news is right underneath her well that's great

[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:35.820]
Don't give me a chance to check out what the right wing lunatics are doing okay at Fox news and news

[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:36.500]
Max.com

[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:40.880]
We don't really give a crap about AOL and they suck. They're the devil

[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.380]
They are the devil they're the evil doors

[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:46.040]
We got 217 votes on a poll and evenly it been up close to an hour yet

[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.800]
So we must be getting somebody going through under besides mr. Ego's

[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.220]
Freepers Jeepers creepers. It must be Steve's creepers

[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:53.380]
Huh?

[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:59.820]
How does ran we have had one call yet about the religion thing and about how God the just sits back and and is on our side

[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:02.780]
That's what the Georgie's always saying George W that is

[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:08.380]
Somebody faxes me this speaking of that German president Rao criticizes Bush's religious fervor

[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:16.160]
The German president says weapons inspectors were the right solution to the conflict with Iraq and the combat zone

[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.540]
US troops kill eight unarmed civilians at checkpoints

[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:24.420]
German president Johannes Rao has added his voice to the millions of others expressing harsh criticism of US president George W

[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:30.800]
Bush and that he's reading against the Iraqi regime reacting into whatever I get to missing a line in a TV interview broadcast

[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:35.960]
Yesterday last night Rao challenged Bush on a subject that's very close to the US president's heart religion

[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:41.140]
The German president whose position puts him above the daily skirmishing among Germany's political party said the Bible

[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:43.220]
Didn't call on anyone to conduct crusades

[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:47.760]
I don't believe that a people receives a message from God to free another people Rao said

[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.880]
He added that Pope John Paul II actually had the right religious approach to the conflict with Iraq

[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.780]
And the days leading up to the fighting the Pope's stress the world would be a defeat for humanity

[00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:02.200]
Whoever decides that all peaceful means available under international law or exhausted assumes a grave responsibility

[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:06.880]
Before God his own conscience and history the Vatican said last month. How do you like that?

[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.660]
Even though of course the Vatican is full of crap

[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:12.220]
But nevertheless even the daughtering old clown like the Pope says cut it out

[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:14.060]
W cut the crap

[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:20.480]
Here's another fact that says the favorite four-letter word down here is F-R-E-E

[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.920]
Absolutely correct

[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:29.100]
Even the grossers have it figured out when they say buy one get one free instead of 50% off restaurants give a free appetizer or dessert

[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:33.240]
Gas stations give free car wash with Philip these are just a few examples

[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:37.300]
You could offer on your show free tickets to the beach and lines would light right up

[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:40.400]
South Florida equals cheap says this faxer and let me say it again

[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:48.640]
Prices right on the phone calls by the way, which I don't see very many of I were doing scrimmous and I have one line flashing pretty embarrassing in it

[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.780]
Well it would be normally

[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:53.460]
Okay

[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:55.440]
W-Q-I-M

[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:57.280]
Hello

[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.960]
Now I would say that it is a rape at the zone

[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:02.640]
Oh

[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:05.100]
W-Q-I-M

[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:11.140]
Okay, there you go there's three in a row three good ones for you. That's the South Florida audience for ladies and gentlemen

[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:13.980]
That's the material you folks have today

[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:17.920]
Just pathetic. I thought we were gonna have a good time today. We did for the first hour

[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.120]
No, we're having a good time. They're not

[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:21.440]
They suck

[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:26.860]
Is there anything new about that? No, they just blow man really blow a big time blow chunks

[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:31.200]
Britain's mirror hires fired veteran Peter R. Net

[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:35.380]
Britain's daily mirror said yesterday at hired veteran US reporter Peter R. Net

[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:40.820]
Sack by American TV Network NBC after he told Iraqi TV the US war plan against Saddam Hussein has failed

[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:46.400]
I report the truth of what's happening in Baghdad and will not apologize for it. He told the tabloid all the way did apologize

[00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:47.980]
What does that mean right?

[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:52.580]
He told the tabloid newspaper one of the most prominent opponents of Britain's involvement in the war

[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:59.040]
I'm still in shock and awe at being fired the New Zealand board R. Net who won a Pulitzer prize for his Vietnam war coverage

[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:01.960]
wrote under the headline banner this war is not working

[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:07.220]
So I took him less than a day to get up a job. He's given his opinion into an ishting and saying his piece

[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:09.220]
Walter Cronkite has a lengthy piece

[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:14.980]
We did that appear by the way. I guess the New York Times and op ed peace which is on our website today. Near Rogers.com

[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:19.160]
I'm not going to read it speaking with the animates in New York Times at which he read I don't know

[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.540]
He's all over the place poor old Walter

[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:22.740]
But he does say at the very end

[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:25.880]
He you know, he says he made a mistake by granting the interview to Iraqi TV

[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:30.000]
But he says mr. R. Net S firing is more than a personal setback within gone from the airwaves

[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.240]
Americans have lost an eye on Baghdad that had proved a valuable addition to our knowledge of the mysterious enemy

[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:40.360]
In other words, he was right there in the middle of the action as opposed to CNN which got kicked out in a restaurant time ago

[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:45.300]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon line

[00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:49.420]
We want to hear about the marlins game yesterday about the free winners about the missing programs. Don't we?

[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:50.600]
no

[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:55.800]
WDQ I am yes, good morning. How are you today? Okay, sir?

[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:02.760]
Listen Neil you know you're you're you're talking this quote you're taking about God. Yeah, problem is God is right now

[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.940]
He's on vacation. Don't you knew that or not?

[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:09.660]
I think as the Kathy firm are you poor crotch at pb and sucking money out of the public?

[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.860]
God's name, huh? And that's why God's that wants to watch this world all

[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:18.860]
Okay, thanks. We didn't warn them. Where are that were you were that what?

[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:23.080]
Whoo

[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:31.020]
We're doing it. We are doing it. Oh, what am I doing here? You know I'd rather catch SARS. No you'd rather take my chance with a

[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:32.140]
Ha about this weather

[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.920]
What about it? You know

[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:40.660]
That's what I had a little what? No, I fear the other day. I'm not not that crazy another week or two. I can handle it right now

[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.620]
Let's get rid of that influenza outbreak up there. Okay, of course

[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:48.800]
That's only like in a couple of hospitals and then they had the quarantine one school

[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:55.080]
I was read across from Scarborough hospitaler because the kids reading of the cafeteria and they were all walking around with gas with masks, you know, yeah

[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.520]
None of them got it

[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:03.700]
But you know how people kind of like panic when something like this comes along especially at these times, you know

[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:06.120]
These times when everybody's a little bit on edge

[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.060]
Purple alert purple alert

[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:15.080]
Well, maybe that maybe that's what I had when I was taking the aspirin with my plavix my skin was turning purple

[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:21.960]
It was a purple alert. Yeah, yeah, it was from inside. Maybe it was the Lord telling me you're taking too many drugs purple alert

[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:25.920]
Yeah, oh my god. Look at that. It's the old purple people leader

[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:32.940]
W. D. Q. I. M. Yeah, I do have a little silver lining for you and

[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:37.900]
That is today's world as I was driving on the turnpike the other day

[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:43.260]
Yeah, as the sun was just starting to go down I looked up and I saw your billboard. Uh-huh

[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:43.960]
and

[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:50.300]
It was amazing that the reflection that the light gave almost looked like the Virgin Mary on your billboard

[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.420]
Oh, yeah, the Virgin Mary does frequently appear on my billboard. As a matter of fact

[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:58.240]
We've we've talked with a Virgin Mary to try to get her to go on to your QM generic billboard the one that says we've got balls

[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.700]
So the dolphins and hurricanes will be more impressed

[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:05.800]
No, actually I thought I saw Jesus and they were lining up at that one. I wasn't sure though. Yeah

[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:12.140]
Thanks for the good news. All right. See us. Oh here it is rich pacta always comes through for me

[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:17.600]
This is the Andy Rooney commentary from 60 minutes the other night. I'm gonna read it. It's not very long

[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.980]
Rich says I too was impressed with the Rooney segment on Sunday. I usually don't watch the show

[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:28.300]
Burned out years ago, but sought and didn't even know old Andy was still alive. Well, I'm not so sure he is

[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:33.860]
But the eyebrows tell you did you see the other piece by Bob Simon on the I told in waiting in a rant

[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:38.400]
No, somebody called us about they yes, they did not see it. Hope you're feeling well. Yes, I am rich a lot better

[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:45.380]
P.S. Phil's been like this since 9-11 his inner redneck has become dominant apparently that's sad

[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:50.460]
That's pathetic. Are you sure? We never even saw any inkling of that when we work with Phil

[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:52.260]
I thought it was a California sushi roll

[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.340]
Exactly

[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:58.000]
Well, there are a lot of people from California who like you know pretend to be one thing

[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.420]
Huh, I'm not gonna mention a name is a pretend to be one thing and then they turn out to be something all together different you ignorant

[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:07.080]
Slut. Yeah, there's another good example a redneck in hiding

[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.440]
With his pickup trucks and is all that crap

[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:15.780]
He's a redneck Rick Riley. I mean their California redness just go ever been to Orange County

[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.660]
I'm not talking about Florida. I mean California matter. Well, don't go back. Okay

[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:20.900]
Out of your smart

[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:27.020]
So well, don't let me forget Andy Rooney when we come back lots of heavy-duty stuff here on this end. Okay. We're prepared. We got our ammunition

[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:33.240]
There's Bob Corret the White House many Iraqis have been ordered to fight God. He sounds just like the president

[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:42.140]
It's 11 after 10 then I guess it goes to sure if you hang off hang off it long enough it starts rubbing off

[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:46.560]
Anyway, let me speak out of that where the weight is fallen off of your body with balance for life

[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.660]
Their food now is better than ever. I'm back on my little black sack. Maybe that's why I feel so good today

[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:55.460]
Maybe the Rubin wrap and the two-as-salad wrap. I'm wrapping it man. I'm an old rapper myself

[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:59.920]
They're delicious. Have you ever had the Rubin wrap? Yeah, I love the drama and

[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.980]
Cool slime and it doesn't have that mungy sauce, you know like in a room and sound

[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:08.860]
I wonder whatever the hell it is. It's delicious. Anyway with balance for life

[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:12.400]

[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.680]
There's no cooking no shopping no cleaning no worries no calorie counting no carbohydrate counting

[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:21.540]
They do all the figuring for you all based on the principles of the zone diet by Dr. Barry Sears

[01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:27.020]
No relation to Brian Sears, but he wishes he was anyway get with the real weight loss program balance for life

[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:32.160]
They bring in that little black sack air and that's where we can't say sack anymore your little black container

[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.520]
Well, if we say sack it sounds like balls, you know

[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.760]
Right pouch can we say we've got sacks?

[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.380]
We got sack

[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.840]
At least so far until Moe Kansas asked anyway little black sack has got all your food for today and then they bring it to you

[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.940]
They deliver right to your door by 6 a.m. At your work at your home wherever you want to deliver it and

The three gourmet meals are in there two delicious snacks and the food is fresh. It's delicious

Nothing is frozen nothing artificial no additives no crap just great and of course you choose between two choices each meal

[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.220]
Everyday that you run a program

So if you're tired of all the other diets that you've tried and failed if you're sick and tired of feeling no energy

She I hope but holy wait listen because you'll come in here with a vacuum cleaner and suck everything out

[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:30.860]
You know what I mean hear that?

[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.000]
That's not good. No, I want to see it's a good thing deaf came in here and said because otherwise

[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.120]
I wouldn't have played that when you see when you're playing a bit you don't hear that in the back

[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:43.540]
But the see even the audience can hear that what kind of crappy equipment you people using you're supposed to be radio-ish

[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.080]
Right, yeah, we're not even like a real like a good make-believe radio station

Well, I was clean that time. Yeah

[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:02.500]
Purple alert

[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:07.680]
Jesus God this whole this whole now what are we gonna do about that?

[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:15.100]
Because that's on a different pot. It's in this board. I think it's sabotage. I think there's sabotage going on here

[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:17.020]
Ladies and gentlemen the one station

[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:24.700]
That there's to speak out against all this insanity and all of a sudden everything's like all screwed up or as deaf was gonna say all

[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.400]
Up you hear that?

[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:29.320]
Let me crank it up. Oh

[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:34.220]
Man that'll wake those bastards up. Here's a couple of fasses

[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:40.480]
From an ashamed American one says well don't get too carried away, okay?

[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:47.180]
I was listening to eight sperm this morning and the caller started to land based him about his pro-war views and boy was how he upset

[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.960]
I guess the truth hurts the caller labeled how he a shill for the conservative right and

[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.920]
Question his political slant for a party that's continually trying to rule his guy from the airwaves

[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:01.060]
Of course how I put his foot in his mouth claiming he voted for Gore and therefore how could he be a right-winger?

[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:04.720]
Syria is sending suicide bombers into Iraq the US has proof of

[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:09.200]
Terrorist funding by Saddam and every other propaganda least news clip for

[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:14.200]
Fed to him by this bush dictatorship. He was quoting have you heard bushes setting his sights on Iran now

[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.480]
We're all doomed sign in the

[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.180]
Raya's name was

[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:21.480]
Who's getting a little carried away? He must be listening to Rumsfeld Syrian Iran must better watch out

[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.580]
And you better not pop because we're pretty in upset

[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.960]
Well, that I am upset now. I was feeling so good, you know, it's this it's this room

[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:36.160]
I got to go back to Toronto because this studio is unfit for our human broadcast. Yeah, it is piece of crap

[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:38.480]
It's it's in the board

[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:42.460]
How can I you think it's just in the speakers risen on the air?

[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.320]
You see what I'm saying?

[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.800]
There's no way to know for sure. Well would be if somebody would call in and tell us

[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.200]
WQ I am

[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:57.460]
More talk is for yeah, yeah, I'll get him out of here get out of our face

[01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.860]
See how can they tell how it sounds on the air sounds like this on the air?

[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.280]
Yeah

[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:04.800]
5 6 7 0 5 oh yeah, you know something yesterday

[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:08.800]
I'm driving home trying to listen to the mad dog and we got the old thing back on up 441

[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:14.220]
But the signal is like impossible. It's never been this bad since we worked here. It's like you're right

[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.900]
So how we have any audience left beats to crap out of me

[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:20.200]
WQ I am

[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.580]
Hey, Neil audio check. Yes, sir

[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:29.400]
Hey, uh, there's audio check. There's Orlando on the radio, but it's gotta be but anyway, I'm calling out

[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.940]
I'm not talking about the signal. I'm talking about the the

[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:37.080]
You hear that? Yeah, what does it sound like crap? Yeah

[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:45.620]
Yes, it's screwed up for a month. I got a web page and I have road runner

[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:49.720]
Yeah, and it connects the server and it buffers

[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:54.500]
That plays for about five seconds. It rebuffers not every 10 seconds

[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:59.840]
We are the only complaint we've had it's got to be you and I take the road runner and I chase his ass down

[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.920]
I get the only while he coyote

[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:07.780]
Well, when I go to Q a M one site and try to connect the listen it plays fine once it connects

[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:13.560]
Yeah, but it takes about 10 minutes for the player to connect our website screwed up George

[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.720]
Okay, thanks for the good news. So all the equipment is screwed up. Let's hear it

[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:23.180]
No wonder I have an arrest break down when I'm here. This place is just not fit for broadcast. This is unacceptable

[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:30.100]
Radiation yeah, not not even radio wish. I mean we don't even resemble the kind of crap we got in here. I still can oh

[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.580]
That's on the air man. That's not just in the speakers

[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.260]
Because you're waiting else. Why you just plan maybe it's a you're gonna test the pot

[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:43.180]
Well, what else are we got? How about you?

[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:49.800]
Understands of the stuff. Oh keep strats of everyone. Well, can't be just that one sound it could be I get out

[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.500]
I know you know why I'm it

[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.260]
That's the cleanest part I ever smell

[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:59.900]
You know why it could be just that sound because I took that beat from our shortcut

[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:04.980]
And I've played it a city in times. Maybe just never noticed it before get out of here

[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:10.920]
We got we got static on a CD. I know we got static on here and now it's one CD not the other crazy

[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:16.240]
You're in a mess. We can have hooliote here and pretend to do something with the big back of the show

[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.660]
Huh, let's just do that until the 1 o'clock

[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.700]
How could it just be a coincidence?

[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.260]
Do you hear that no

[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:40.100]
Clean as a whistle. Yeah, maybe you exercise the pot. Maybe I cleaned it out when it's out

[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.500]
I cleaned it out. Listen about it. It's just pretty neat during the show all day

[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:48.940]
Yeah, we're gonna do transmitter and equipment maintenance here during the arrived your show probably gonna 50 share

[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:53.500]
Okay, now test all the other pots individually. Yeah, okay, let's most some clean them. Oh, that's right

[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:58.260]
Muffling it all up sit again like he did with Anthony and glad about the story on that. What is the story?

[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:01.140]
The story is there is no story. What do you remember that didn't happen?

[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:08.240]
He saw them all coming out of a car all of a sudden smoke coming out of the car as they were exiting the car

[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:14.320]
The people the aforementioned people and possibly others that we don't know. Yeah, we're exiting the car

[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:21.360]
And a big cloud of smoke exited with them and Duff was going to his car and he just waved and like like hey, how you doing?

[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.340]
Yeah, I know who made up that story. Who made up that crap? I don't know who told you some of the sales people

[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:29.900]
I think was high boy that was in their gossiping with that fat piece of turd man that fat

[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:32.640]
There was no issue. There was no comment was all that

[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.220]
So anyway, Muff was in here and said

[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:42.020]
Yeah, he did say that and then he ran out of here. Oh, it's gonna be in trouble. I'm gonna be in trouble

[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:43.580]
Greg is listening. I'm gonna be in trouble

[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:47.020]
So there was no lecture no one was called into the odds

[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:52.500]
See it was just another fantasy story here at QM nobody called in anybody for smoking a little wacky weed

[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:55.260]
Okay, in fact, that's our middle name weed

[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:01.220]
Right, we're gonna put that up in the next billboard for managers last thing right right, right weed. That's correct

[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.340]
I know somebody who probably says that

[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:06.200]
But I don't want to mention no names now wait till you're this facts

[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:11.740]
This is the epitome here is Edward our morrow said the epitome of what's this town is all about in fact

[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:16.160]
I'm even though we got a short break. I'm gonna do it first because I want to spend at least four or five hours on this

[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:21.860]
All right mark in Miami mark you have set me off baby. All I can say is have a nice life

[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:27.520]
Neil where's the fun that that's how it starts now? Let me do the break and then we'll come back

[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:33.320]
I know you wait a season you'll love this because you cannot please this town no matter what

[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:38.240]
You do you can't please unless it's something for free. Maybe mark would like a one the mug

[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.360]
Can we give you a one the mug mark? How about a free weeny?

[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:46.480]
Oh, you can't please this crowd talk about hard to please but clean

[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:51.360]
Oh, it's nice and clean and pristine rhymes with silly old queen

[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:55.360]
10 25 at 5 60 WQM

[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:58.600]

[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:16.280]
I

[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:23.360]
Want to bang in the butt honey 1028 at 560 W3M

[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.600]
So I will get to that facts, but first Andy Rooney

[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:29.780]
With a big eyebrows remember I said I was gonna be the Andy Rooney if I don't do it now

[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:32.920]
I will put it off to the side burying the sea of these other important facts is

[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:38.620]
Rooney on a 60 minutes on Sunday night said we all find war a more and more interesting let me try it again

[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:44.360]
We all find war more interesting than peace anytime death is imminent life is exciting and we're watching this whereas though is a video game

[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:49.840]
On television it's hard to know where to look to find what you want to know there are pictures on top of pictures

[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:53.760]
Moving print on top of those there's more than the eye can see or the brain comprehend

[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:57.880]
The generals are giving us the play-by-play action from their Hollywood studio and Qatar

[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.420]
They're telling us everything, but we don't feel we know anything

[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:04.340]
Summer port is a detached military units and we're getting stunning coverage from them

[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:07.820]
We're seeing more first hand we're all asking each other what we think to

[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:12.740]
Strangers ask me what I think is if I was smart because I'm on television. I have opinions no information

[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.000]
Experts talk about precision bombing, but on the ground where the bombs hit

[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.940]
It's not precise people are killed history destroyed

[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:24.880]
We didn't shock them and we didn't awe them and bagged that the phrase makes us look like foolish Braggerts

[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.660]
The president ought to fire whoever wrote that for them just an opinion

[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:33.820]
We haven't caught been loved and so we're transferring the blame for 9.11 the Sodom who's saying there are soldiers who think that's why they're fighting

[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:37.480]
Who's saying is a bad man who didn't have anything to do with 9.11 just an opinion?

[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:41.700]
When I see president Bush with soldiers, I wish he'd been the one at war himself

[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:46.780]
He'd know more about where he was saying he was sending those soldiers just an opinion

[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:48.800]
It bothers me that America's hated

[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:52.800]
I don't like to be hated personally which happens and I don't like my country to be hated which has happened

[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:58.200]
I have one opinion. I don't like having we have stores of biological chemical and nuclear weapons in this country

[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:03.440]
If we were losing this world we as the last resort use them. I'm afraid we might who say and has chemical and

[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:06.540]
biological weapons if he's about to lose this world will he use them?

[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:11.320]
I'm afraid he might I wish my America had never gotten into this war, but now that we're in it. I want us to win it

[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:16.180]
What a great commentary by Andy Rooney man talk about balls. That was great

[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:22.340]
And of course, that's why nobody's watching CBS because they're in the tiny minority just like yours truly just on a show

[01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:25.020]
Well, you know, it's a good thing. We got that gigantic February in the ratings

[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:32.160]
Because from now on worth the mercy of all the war or the bullet huggers and the hocks and the abusher liquors

[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.040]
And that's why it goes I don't care like I started to say before before I interrupted myself

[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:41.120]
I don't come on here and give opinions or take positions because it's gonna be popular. Get me ratings

[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.240]
That's crap. That's garbage

[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:50.460]
And so some of these people are being very inconsistent now who are like obviously pandering to what they feel is the overwhelming majority of the public

[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:53.980]
Are you sure shame on them? I'm embarrassed for them and humiliated

[01:19:55.740 --> 01:20:01.880]
Anyway, Mark and Miami faxes and I'll say it again this fax to me represents 27 plus years on this

[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:07.500]
On a Uranus town. Listen Neil. Where's the fun? Three question marks? Yes, we know war is bad

[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:12.740]
We know that there are a gate priest in the church. We know. I'm always an asshole. We know that station management is useless

[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:17.780]
You keep saying you don't want to do topical radio, but yet you keep going on and on about the depressing war

[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:24.320]
Obviously the war is a major issue, but there's a million new channels and websites that we can get it info from let's have some fun

[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.380]
All your recent polls are so serious

[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:31.000]
What about having a fun pool during these depressing times? Let's go back to your face

[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:38.880]
Like yesterday we did a war pull about which statement is more relevant to sound like I thought there were some hysterical choices on here to sound Florida

[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:44.680]
Anyway, what about having a fun pool during these depressing times? Let's go back to your favorite movie favorite TV show favorite song

[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:49.000]
Gathering a list for those polls was fun it kept our mind off all the Schmidt happening in the world

[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.300]
I love your show. I'll listen regardless. I just wanted to share my thoughts as Mark and Miami. Well Mark

[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:58.320]
Yeah, we can't please you can't we sweet are we doing a heavy show today? No?

[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:04.980]
Have I talked about gay priest in the church today? No, in fact, did I talk about bonding with mole and kind of a yeah, right?

[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:12.880]
And let me also say for some of you simple-minded people the pool is not the show the pool is something we do every day at our website

[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:16.820]
Sometimes we talk about it sometimes we never even make reference to it other than read the results

[01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:22.060]
Not what the show is the show is about whatever you want to talk about I understand it's not too easy because you got nothing to talk about

[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:26.320]
It's a supplement. It's a set set. It's an appendage. It's part of the show. That's all

[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:31.060]
Like when you go to a lot of websites they got a poll on their free to vote out. What do you think about this? What do you think?

[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:34.100]
Right and those poll building shows while I

[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:39.500]
Need to do they hate them. Oh, they're totally took a poll on that and the audience said oh, we don't want to hear any of that

[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:43.260]
Those long likely polls where people call it and say like two words gone with a wind

[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:47.420]
Yeah, no, I'm gonna explain what you want. They call up with whatever they think you

[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:52.580]
Know, just name a whole bunch of things good golly miss Molly. What's your favorite?

[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.520]
I think your brain is gonna suck. Yeah, I think that's the problem

[01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:02.760]
So anyway, Mark and Miami were delighted that you listen, but they cut the crap, okay? Where's the fun?

[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:08.300]
In addition to which is our poll today like really super serious a couple of the choices on there

[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.180]
God doesn't carry his busy with ball games

[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:16.000]
Everybody serious even the Lord loves neo-Rodgers. Yeah, heavy duty and very serious

[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.980]
I mean light enough a little bit sweet art. Will you please? I'm trying to like trying to like pace it like yesterday

[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:25.520]
Was probably a very very serious most of the four hours. They were trying to have like a little lighten it up a little bit

[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:28.780]
And here's a guy right out. Oh, it's not keep it light Neil keep it light

[01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:32.040]
Where's the fun? Yeah, probably up his ass

[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:35.780]
Probably got a whole bunch of creatures crawling around in there

[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:37.900]
God almighty mark

[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:41.940]
You can't please these people for love or money and again

[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:45.140]
Let me say the price is right on this show. You like it great. You hate it so much

[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:47.680]
You can't turn it off great if you don't want to listen bye-bye

[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:53.080]
That's it. You can't stand somebody who's not a warmonger on a year. Bye-bye. You can't stand the truth

[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:57.360]
Bye-bye and I'll say it again ever since this war started and before it started

[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:03.220]
I am still waiting for the first person to call this show and give me any

[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:07.780]
Real justification of why this war is going on not that I want to discuss it every day all day

[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:12.060]
Which I'm not doing in their press. Let me show you the Jordan times. See I mean we could put that on all day

[01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:15.120]
I'm not doing that today. I want to give everybody a rest including me

[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:23.020]
But it's it's always the personal attack while I sure hope I'm glad the troops can't hear a faggot like you and the things you're saying

[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:27.460]
That's great. That's brilliant. All it does is show us your ass show us where you're coming from

[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:33.620]
Just like Moe. Aren't we attacked on 9-11? Oh God. Yeah, so let's invade Delaware

[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:36.100]
Okay, it's a lot smaller and a lot closer than Vade Miramar

[01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:41.800]
We know the terrorists are actually there. There you go. Let's invade Miramar. Let's not get too close to the track, but other than that

[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.620]
Blue alert near a mirror a Miramar purple alert

[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:48.540]

Well, I didn't know

[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:27.300]
Well, I never used that once so what the hell do I know about it?

[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.160]

[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:34.400]
That's really what I know on it. Oh

[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:37.140]
Here's a fast coming in as fast cover sheet

[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:44.720]
Don't you hate those why and look at that and the second page which is what it did nothing on it

[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:50.800]
He always one piece of paper when they can waste it. Yes, who this is from it's from Mark

[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:56.380]
Mark Mark who I just read the fact that first from hey, I hate to break the news for you mark

[01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:58.720]
But your second message is a blind sheet of paper

[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:04.620]
WQ I am yeah, yeah, sir. How you doing sir? I'm doing very well. Thank you

[01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:10.780]
You just made a Freudian slip a few moments. I'm sorry. You said that we're not gonna talk about the gay priest in the in the church

[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:14.380]
Yeah, well, you've always said that their pedophile priest not gay priest well

[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:18.220]
Whatever I mean I was just reading from his facts, but I at least said okay. Thank you

[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:22.060]
Don't be so uptight. Okay. Don't be so uptight because everybody knows

[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:25.120]
Right so they couldn't possibly be gay

[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:31.900]
So try to get Mark whatever I guess he's gonna do like a back-and-forth marker with a facs machine who finds it a lot easier than calling up

[01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:35.160]
There are a lot of people that don't want to call because they're afraid I'm a mean nasty guy

[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:39.160]
And I'll hang up on him and make him look like a jackass. They get nervous. They get tongue tied

[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:42.480]
And here's another facs but it's not from Mark

[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:45.900]
I guess Mark just they ran out of materials. He's just sending me blank pages now

[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:54.320]
Here's one it says it's not about oil or a rack. It's about the US in Europe going head-to-head on world economic dominance is what it says

[01:25:54.920 --> 01:26:00.840]
By Jeffrey heard in Australia down under I don't I don't want to get into it. I'm getting ahead. I just thinking about it

[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:05.180]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 and T and for rising

[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:11.160]
Wireless line. We're still waiting to hear from the God Squad out there about how you rationalize all the butchering of these innocent

[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:16.680]
Memblem and children on both sides including our military our poor young people who are sent over there for an unjust and

[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:19.840]
Acceptable conflict being put in harm's way

[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:27.700]
And the eight or ten or whatever the real number was of those people and and why we're picking it out just because it was one obvious

[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:33.080]
You know situation how about the four soldiers killed by the suicide bomber on Saturday? There's four more dead people

[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:38.800]
Mm-hmm and the numbers keep going up very slowly and it's 43 now in the 34 Brits

[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:43.420]
Which is 77 and then by the end of the week it'll be like a hundred and then it'll be a couple a hundred and of course

[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:47.960]
We don't know how many thousands of Iraqis and how many they are saying the red cross it by the way

[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:53.420]
Of course, we know what a bunch of Kami pink was there so I think that the Iraqis are right that and in Baghdad alone

[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:58.400]
Over a hundred people a day are being invented for a three-minute hospitals over a hundred a day

[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:00.840]
Those are the ones who are still alive

[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.740]
And all the humanitarian groups are saying ten times the combined casualties of the US and Britain

[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:11.140]
Die have died in civilians

[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:13.900]
Numbers of civilians how do you like that?

[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:19.640]
But I thought I remember they're deliberate them by liberation by elimination the ones that live there

[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:24.160]
You're gonna get markup set again because you're starting with a heavy worst of can we have some fun?

[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:25.820]
No, can't we have some fun?

[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:29.020]
Why don't you take a poll on your favorite toilet paper? No?

[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:35.680]
Boy talk about whimpering mark you're you he started he must hang out with a mad dog, you know talk about having no balls

[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:40.140]
Grow a little peer even Greg regrow pair. What pretty proud of around here

[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:42.920]
I mean we don't like him anymore than we used to but break hate you, you know

[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:47.280]
In fact, I know since I've been back as he's showing his head in this door. Have you seen him last few days?

[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:52.980]
Yeah earlier like Monday. Yeah, that's on didn't show his face in here

[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:56.240]
No, but I'm back briefly to see my smiling face to see if I'm okay

[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:59.500]
What does he have I recovered from my stroke, huh? What's new about that? Yeah?

[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:03.960]
Because he's a pussy. He's another one who's a scared to like look me in the eye because he knows he's full of crap

[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.420]
And the good news is he finally paid norm can't yeah

[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:11.080]
How do you like that finally what's goes to show you you know

[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:15.940]
Just because you don't get paid stuff and you got your bonus early this last time which course that'll be the last one

[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:22.800]
We ever get well, not don't say early. I got it not right here not late for a hear you got it very very early

[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:30.040]
You got it way way before you dreamed you'd ever even sniff it for the due date right before the doodah

[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.880]
Nice go on Greg you're really moving up Greg H. You now

[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:38.560]
We'll see who has the balls, you know, that's a good line especially for him

[01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:44.440]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound fight. I'm waiting for the facts for mark. I can't wait

[01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:50.580]
Now he can't do it. I guess he can't get it up and and oh here. Oh, he's faxing me this stuff

[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:53.400]
This must be a different mark. I guess I don't know

[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:58.180]
If you're more than one mark out there now with our slim audience we got now in fact

[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:01.760]
That's gonna be the limit one per name and we already know if your name is Dave

[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:06.700]
You'll have to tune out because we already got Jeff High's neighbor Dave right did you put that thing in here that song?

[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:11.480]
No, not yet, but we got it. Oh, yeah, probably don't have enough room left in the VCS for that

[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:19.660]

Maybe they have the smell cam I

[01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:58.760]

Nobody knows that under my clothes. I wear pantyhors, but that don't mean that I'm gay if you think my arms

[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.140]
I've had you ought to see my legs. I might as well keep on smoothing shave to show a little clasped the next time I'm raping

[01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:37.760]
I could go to a surgeon, but that gives me the shivers. I would not want the walk. I'm looking like John Rivers

[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:43.600]
Where am I? I buy a little beast the fat little freak. I did them a favor now

[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:49.560]
I can't afford it. The reason I dismissed that stink and fat bastard as big as he wouldn't shut up and he can't play

[01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:50.780]
Connected

[01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:54.800]
Nobody talk over there. Nobody talk from around. I rap then you talk

Look at me. I'm big. I ain't no square. I'm a thing done daddy man. I'm really dead

[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:07.760]
I buy a ready one I want. I don't care. Let's believe they make me flip my wig later smelly green hair

[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:10.920]
I got tired myself and even happens to the grapes

[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:16.220]
Westwood would send you get out of here. Oh, I'll sweep rake your legs. So now I sit by the pool life says good as

[01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:20.120]
Engendons with my paladin cocktail placing bets on the jinks

[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:23.740]
Paradise paradise. I don't kiss nobody's ass in paradise

[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:29.660]
I'll be sure to love the screw kids when I get the chance that the cleaners aren't ready with my lime green pants

[01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:30.600]
How long does it take?

[01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:33.980]
Kelly calling the plate. It was just a little thought so what I love this day

[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:38.580]
I think that's funny when I'm not gonna sell it's buddy. I can do what I want. The management loves me

[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:42.840]
But the longest time I wanted you to be my

[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:45.140]
Oh, you wipe my tight bow. Now I'll say hello

[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:10.780]
Head 45 at 560 WQ I am see one of the reasons that she's so intolerable from what I hear because I don't listen to where I haven't heard her in a couple of years

[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:17.360]
Is because she's on this rampage day after day. She's the left wing equivalent to what the right wingers are the one no Charlie's

[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:20.900]
And I find that like intolerable. I don't I don't want to do that. I'm not gonna do it

[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:24.500]
So those of you who keep faxing me all these articles I not that I don't appreciate it

[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:26.780]
But I do read the New York Times online every day, okay?

[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:33.000]
And we have stuff on our website every day like marine dogs calm and Paul Krugman and Nick Kristoff and all of these things and at a trills

[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:36.420]
But we do have that say and again, it's just like that facts

[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:39.940]
I read from Mark in the dark whatever that guy's name is you can't please everybody

[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:42.580]
But we're trying to we always try to ride the a fine line here

[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:46.660]
Between not getting too heavy duty and getting everybody depressed and suicidal

[01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:50.660]
And like trying to put out at least a differing up one of you which we do

[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:54.540]
But good golly miss Molly some of you people lighten up them

[01:33:54.540 --> 01:34:00.700]
If I wanted to be immersed in this I just I will just put on a goddamn networks all day reading like I said before right we can do that

[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:05.880]
And step on Saturday with the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit in Southern Iraq

[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:13.280]
One thing that is quite weird. Wait if you watch the cable system searing Kuwait system the Arab news now

[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:19.040]
I'm not gonna do it. Okay. I'm absolutely not gonna do. I don't want to sit there watching at home all day. Do you know?

[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:24.980]
Oh, here's here's Mark again. Oh, and you know something this must be a different mark who sent me and don't be sending me this again

[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:28.180]
You Jack one page one of 15. Oh no

[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.600]
Stop it you clown you

[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.760]
This has got to be a different mark. Yeah, it is

[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:40.100]
This is the other extreme. This is somebody who sent me a 15 page thing which I canceled on here

[01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:44.980]
Which I don't have the time nor the inclination to read when you stop it. You're just what I was just talking about

[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.980]
Oh, no, we want you to be the voice of reason. Well good go. Well reason this okay

[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:53.100]
I'd rather talk about data

5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:59.800]

Cranky nasty this time manage. Just tear your part tear your kishkis out

[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:11.860]
Yeah, we don't want that whatever you don't we don't want that we want to list them in we want to talk heavy duty about the war

[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:15.760]
We want you to do this. We want you to be that go on national radio show that rush limbaugh

[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:17.620]

Don't forget they want your tickets to an addition to which here

[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:26.620]
I am trying not to pat myself on the back again like most said I did about the baseball broadcast

[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:32.060]
But here we are in this show both of us trying desperately to like present this one alternative of

[01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:37.520]
You point one little voice in a wilderness on this one crappy station with a bad signal and is a poster like you know

[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:43.360]
These people want to be looking their radio for it. Yeah, we can never do good enough to please them no matter what it is you do

[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:47.860]
What game are we gonna play today uncle Neal? What game are we gonna play today?

[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:52.920]
Peta now you know what it feels like to be married. Oh wow forget about that

[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:56.520]
I'll tell you right now. That's one of the great things

[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:00.020]
Yeah, in fact, I have no idea all these people are want to get married all these gay marriages

[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:06.700]
Not that's one of the great things about being gay now having to worry about crap like that some painly as nattering nagging wife

[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:09.820]
Yeah, yeah, you know you know what I'm talking about

[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:14.560]
I'm just gonna get pregnant unexpected one day just as a way to like seal your fate for the rest of your life

[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:20.060]
I wasn't thinking of anybody specifically. I said that of course not here's a fact

[01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:24.340]
This is you are on today. Wow whatever that means am I I am on something drugs?

[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:25.880]
maybe we indicate share

[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:31.580]
It says we've gone to the point of this country that if you can say it's something against the war

[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:36.180]
You're on American and not a Christian. Well guess what I'm not on American, but I'm certainly not a Christian. Thank God

[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:37.240]
Thank

[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:38.160]
Huh?

[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:47.160]
Facts is just unbelievable. Oh, let's see. It's not me. I only say one fax is Mark and Miami now we know that mark

[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:48.600]
And thank you

[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:51.440]
In fact, I like this guy better than the guy that sent me to 19 pages

[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:55.860]
Mark and Miami says by the way, I didn't mean to ruffle your feathers. Don't feel bad. Mark. You didn't ruffle my feathers

[01:36:56.380 --> 01:37:02.120]
I wasn't giving you one listeners opinion. I'm sure you have thousands of others that disagree or he was just whatever he says

[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:07.220]
Alas or also I can't call it because my work beside that rather facts you'd probably hang up on me if I called you

[01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:12.620]
I'm a sensitive guy and don't know if I could deal with that one a lot of sensitive people

[01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:15.980]
I can just a radio show. What if I did hang up like what have you heard like

[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:20.140]
That okay, you heard that be the world just a dial tone

[01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:25.660]
What's the big deal with that? Okay, what's the matter with you got like a small pita problem?

[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.360]
Anyway, it says you're on today. Wow

[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:33.600]
Well, maybe because I'm feeling a little bit better although I'm starting to have a relapse after that bonding with Mo

[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.420]
I started feeling much better about life

[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:41.620]
That says we've got the point this country that if you say something against the war you're on American and not a Christian

[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:46.260]
The latter I can deal with but the link between Christianity and politics scares the hell out of me amen

[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:50.000]
Jesus has to be Republican. Could you imagine a Democrat claiming to be a Christian?

[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:55.500]
That means you have to have voted for Clinton and who could possibly be a court or Christian and vote for Clinton

[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.240]
But from what I've read Jesus was definitely not conservative

[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:03.660]
Out here in the trenches of society must either be prepared to fight to give your opinion as a liberal or settle

[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:05.480]
Be a closet Democrat and keep your mouth shut

[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:10.120]
I'm a Vietnam vet. That was an unjust conflict under a democratic prison

[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.340]
That's right at least in the beginning

[01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:14.680]
It was wrong to send us over there to be injured or killed for absolutely no reason whatsoever

[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:19.080]
In stating this I think I just don't flaunt the party line and repeat what I hear

[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:22.720]
This war is as unjust as in Southeast Asia

[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:26.600]
I'm an American but would not send a child of mine to serve in this commander in chief in this war

[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:30.900]
There are things worth fighting for and there are things worth dying for neither of which applied to this action

[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:35.520]
Guess what all but the right wing chuckleheads in the whole world agree that's right Darrell you're right

[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:40.500]
Where are the good old days when all we had to care about who was who was giving you bubble of BJ in a white house?

[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:43.060]
Oh right. How do we long for those days or what?

[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:50.380]
Those were bad times and by the way for certain right wing wackos out there who are upset about we've got balls

[01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:51.340]
I hate to break the news deal

[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:57.200]
But is anybody remember Kenny stars pornographic report? Oh, yeah, that was good. Yeah, and that was really heavy duty stuff

[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:00.940]
That was for Jesus in fact a lot of people said there was some of the most pornographic stuff

[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:06.020]
That ever appeared in a non-pornile website and it has given the internet. Yeah, how do you like that? That was good

[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:12.740]
That's what Bubba said he said was pretty good and this mark is starting to send me this graphic stop it

[01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:15.560]
I'm gonna give his number on an ear if he don't stop sending me this crack

[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:20.180]
Where's this idiot from oh six oh he's from out of town. What's six oh three area code

[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:25.080]
I don't know I could look it up. I don't know, but we're not taking his faxes. Is it idiot?

[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:30.520]
19 pages my ass you lunatic you stop it now you maniac

[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:34.440]
Before we get done rumsfeld on your freaking dumb ass

[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:40.100]
350 votes on the pool how does religion permit the carnage of this war in Iraq?

[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:43.300]
We're still waiting for the first call by the way to explain that to us haven't got one yet

[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:48.720]
Religious fanaticism is that through to the problem 185 people say that

[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:55.380]
God doesn't carry his busy with ball games 69 people say that George 69

[01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:57.300]
69

[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.760]
Even the Lord loves neo-roger's 54 said that

[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:07.100]
54 people who get it. I know that the Lord even loves neo-roger's

[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:10.560]
It doesn't the 10 commandments. Say thou shalt thou kill 25

[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:16.040]
It's self-defeiting God will allow a 13 and God wants us to kill our enemies 7

[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:21.340]
What a lovely thought even though of course it happens to me true for all you Bible flumters out there for the god squad

[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:26.640]
God says kill this one and kill the first born male children of the Egyptians and m-mah-mah-mah-mah

[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:30.680]
All this other crap well. He did that just to show you how it's done as a favor

[01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:34.540]
You mean like tell us how to uh deal with our slaves

[01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:38.560]
It is this mark jerk is you know stop it mark. We don't want your crap

[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.820]
I'm not talking about mark and my man talking about mark out of town geek

[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:47.660]
No case whack job lunatic fanatic

[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:51.360]
Send his fascism over to the Randy pita show

[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:55.080]
Randy pita Randy pita show right

[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:57.520]
WQ I am

[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:01.180]
Listen to that what's going on there man?

[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:05.680]
What's up? Listen to questions and just to be a friend. I did disagree with you

[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:07.720]
Are you coming to read over there? What are they waiting?

[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:08.820]
Yeah, I was some

[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:15.440]
Somebody's got some drug bust to me. You're not an old James house, right? No, I'm nearby though. I see there you go

[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:18.860]
Two questions for it. First of all, I did disagree with you on the war. That's fine

[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:20.720]
Yeah, good luck. Yeah, but but the

[01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:23.680]
Why do you and you're labeling people?

[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.200]
You know not to do if they disagree with you. I mean that's just neither

[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:30.920]
Everybody who disagrees with me is a Nazi if I ever said that

[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:34.000]
Everybody the right wing is enough. That's crazy. That's that

[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.620]
When did I when did I say that?

[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:38.560]
You in front of

[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:44.600]
No, no, no, you know what it sounds like it sounds to me like you got a guilty conscience. What I've never said that

[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:49.360]
You're reading into it. I've used the term Nazi and referring to the people who are controlling this country right now

[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:52.240]
The administration and I do not retract that. I believe that very strongly

[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:54.800]
I believe that before the election that I believe it now even more so

[01:41:54.800 --> 01:42:00.160]
Okay, but you do you do you have no follow people who just disagree with you and you know for different reasons

[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.680]
They don't necessarily have to be Nazis

[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:08.800]
Right or shift of course for those people who like to do castra like like the Pope

[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:11.920]
And you guys ever disagree you enjoy it

[01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:15.080]
No, not if he wants to get paid again

[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:22.940]
See you do we ever disagree? I don't think there's anything we do agree on other than polapal politics religion the godfather

[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:28.080]
That's about it. That's it. Polon thinks religion the godfather is the only three things that we agree on

[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:31.640]
Exactly

[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:38.220]
Everybody agrees on a godfather in fact if you don't like the godfather, you probably some kind of a moron

[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:39.940]
A Nazi

[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:45.080]
Yeah, I would agree with that and a communist right

[01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:49.420]
A communisty

[01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:51.940]
Well, let me tell you something my crud McFran

[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:57.440]
567 05 60 boy to godfathers where it's at you why are you depressed god?

[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:02.280]
I told you go out and get the trilogy get the a CD the DVD the DVD stick to godfather in your pants

[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:05.500]
And just sit there and kill some hours lock yourself in the house or with some good company

[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:09.500]
Maybe took a take a look at your data or somebody else's

[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:16.300]
567 05 60 we're having a wonderful show here today in spite of my a mark Mike whenever his name is

[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:18.980]
He's we got him straight now now. He was a little bit out of sorts

[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:24.180]
Where's the fun? Where is the fun? Look in your pantaloonies mark. Maybe you'll find some fun in there

[01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:28.100]
You know maybe like guilty. Maybe you'll find a loaf in there, huh some olive loaf

[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:34.220]
I'm not exaggerating you know me. I would never make up something like that. There was some kind of a stench

[01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:38.420]
Maybe they were farting, huh? Because I know I am right now. No, no

[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:43.340]
I've smelled farts in my life. I've been around a lot longer than you have. Okay. I've smelled including my own

[01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:49.020]
Some of which would kill it's partly Iraqi army, okay, but this was in a league of its own

[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:54.080]
Yeah, but have you smelled most farts before this wasn't mode. This was guilty. Mo was still in the room

[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:55.860]
Maybe this is bag they get seeped

[01:43:56.340 --> 01:44:03.700]
Oh, and what is this from mr. Lemieux? I wonder if he's related to Mario a letter. Oh, no, no

[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:09.560]
Not what it's seven pages. I don't want this

[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:15.860]
I don't want this crap. Are you a crazy person? There what? Oh these people are so good

[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:19.880]
You know something this is another good reason for me not to even get involved in any of this

[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:25.200]
Just yeah, you know what I'm saying. I know because they want me to be like a male Randy Rhodes now, you know, she's small potato

[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:25.800]
She's like

[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:30.340]
She ought to stick to her or something she knows about which ain't that

[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:32.080]
God

[01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:34.640]
Remember the good old days when she used to talk about

[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:43.200]
About boobs and pita. Yeah, yeah before she became a maven on world affairs and be sure before she became a wannabe a

[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.120]
Left-wing lard ass wannabe

[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:53.840]
Somebody who lives in a total dream world. Oh, let her to John rumsfeld in this one and now stop it

[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:58.900]
Don't say that to me. I can't do nothing for you. Okay. I'm just some silly old fag on a radio here

[01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:03.140]
Trying to eke out a meager living all right. Just leave me alone with all these silly stupid facts as God

[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:05.760]
Nothing make you want a puke

[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:08.640]
Nothing to make you want to chop off somebody's teda

[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.300]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:19.860]
pound 5 60 on a 18 t the very apologetic Jim Mandage will be here at one o'clock this afternoon in the studio. How do you like that?

[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:25.160]
How do you like that, mad dog? Who's gonna get Ricky up low? Well, you'll tell us I guess

[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:31.280]
And he'll be apologizing for his fated to really tell it like it is. I mean, is that what he's always saying

[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:35.160]
He's the guy that tells it like it is all of he admits that when it comes to the orphaned organization

[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:40.600]
He's a real pussy and he whips up and shuts down or shuts up and the whips down. Why Shula's not there anymore

[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.260]
He doesn't owe them anything anymore

[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:46.580]
He does Shula's a chula steak too very often as a matter of fact and so does the Humper oh

[01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:50.820]
So there's this rather incestuous relationship

[01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:54.860]
Let's see why we are racking attack from Sam

[01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:59.080]
Vorshlove the Iraqi people so much he's willing to spend more than a hundred million dollars

[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:00.160]
Hundred million

[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:01.640]
We're talking about

[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:08.980]
74 and a half billion so far just for starters give many of our troops and the wreckies of it is killed just so the rest of the Iraqi people be free

[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:13.560]
That's right liberation by emancipation. I's going Sam you got it, baby

[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:20.520]
That's why we love them so much. We love them to death. Yeah, just like the border game Christians. We love you to death

[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:26.320]
1058 at 560 WQA you know I'm starting to like Canada a lot more

[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.360]
Every minute of every day with or without that SARS, you know, I'm just starting to

[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.380]
Why don't you go back to Canada you do

[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:33.320]
Bastard okay

[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:40.380]
Let me tell you right now if you had a hair problem if it's missing if your hairs have gone down the drain and on the flow and all over the place

[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:45.820]
Gone with the wind you got a big ugly bald spot like Boka Brian for example and you ought to be ashamed blaming him for

[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:47.760]
being a degenerate or whatever was

[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:51.260]
Charles Alfie here is the guy can get your hair back for you and make you look great

[01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:55.620]
In fact, I noticed in my bonding moments with Mo this morning that that thing actually moves your mind on his head

[01:46:55.620 --> 01:47:00.100]
Yeah, I wonder why they sometimes laugh when he goes in or thought that he's telling any funny material

[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:04.440]
It's just a laugh when they see that piece starting to move around from side to side from front to back

[01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:10.320]
It's a panic if you don't want people laughing at you because you got a mousy looking piece on your head or because it looks like an animal

[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:14.980]

You go back to kill for you spent faster coming up tonight on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story

[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:21.120]
We take it good hard stiff looking to start

[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:25.660]
She took the inspiration for her music from the way she felt about life

[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:29.140]
And that's what gave us the happy go lucky stylings of

[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:30.500]
At Benatar

[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:41.240]
Oh my goodness yes one has to draw from life doesn't one

[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:47.480]
Hit me with your best shot was about this vicious bastard. I'm that who deserved to be castrated

[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:55.020]
That Benatar was clearly on a mission to bring light into our lives through the positive upbeat sentiments in her songs

[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:04.320]
Oh, yes hard breaker that was my way of giving to be

[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:06.020]
You'd all man

[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:08.480]
The lion the bags

[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:15.800]
Benatar's four Grammys for best rock female vocal seem to indicate that America was also infatuated with her

[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:17.700]
Gleeful wonders take on life

[01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:23.040]
Well certainly love is a battlefield

[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:30.380]
Honestly, I wonder why anyone bothers is it really worth it just to have a little ride on the baloney pony?

[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:32.720]
I fucking well think not

[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:42.160]
Finally Pat turned her adoring gaze from male female relationships to the joyous life-affirming subject of child abuse

[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:46.200]
Alice

[01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:51.100]
Well the scars do go back to childhood don't they

[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:55.940]
Oh, it's all a pile of useless life isn't it? Oh dear. Yes

[01:49:56.740 --> 01:50:00.680]
Pat Benatar she was the feel good artist of the 80s

[01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:01.720]
Not

[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:07.380]
It's a big juicy stopping went look at show business tonight but inside the behind

[01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:11.420]
1103 at 560 wqf so Greg Readison here was said we do have ball

[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:13.520]
Maybe that big yet, but they're growing your feet

[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:17.280]
Rick from tapas is having lived in South Florida certainly agree. It's a bitter

[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:21.820]
And this is a great line a bitter crusty place to live absolutely

[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:27.520]
Oh god, are you right Rick or what however? It's a breath of fresh air compared to Tampa and again

[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.000]
Two for two

[01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:36.100]
I was in a pub the other day went over to conversation between two stereotypical tampons who were watching the Fox news channel

[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:39.140]
Kind of planning how the Iraqis were gonna pay us back for their liberation

[01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:43.560]
I was in shock and awe that at this point they still don't get that this is all about the oil

[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:47.240]
Then they left separately one driving a hummer and they're the driving a Lincoln navigator

[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:50.680]
I can't wait to get the hell out of this second-rate city says poor Rick from Tampa

[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:54.120]
And you know what we say on this show Rick when it comes to our friends in Tampa

[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:56.520]
Not you personally Rick but the town

[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:58.980]
Yeah, you can just imagine can you imagine

[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:05.780]
The shows on FLA which of course they Schmidt-Meister is on over here that FL a rush light

[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.860]
But can you imagine a crap that there's be one?

[01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:12.660]
I don't want to boy

[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:14.520]
Look at the oh here

[01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:22.880]
This is seriously this started out as one of the most incredible days of my life and it's just continuing to get better and better

[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:28.680]
And stop passing me stuff from the god damn New York Times. I read the times that length online every day

[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:34.120]
I appreciate all your help, but you know, it's like helping the old lady across the street. You don't want to cross it

[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:36.520]
God

[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:40.180]
Here's a fact. This is a couple of things. I'll try to make them brief

[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:46.440]
Mad dog will never say anything bad about the pussy dolphins or moe for that matter as they get checks from Wayne

[01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:48.780]
All right, that's a good point

[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:56.020]
Unfortunately that gives them each absolutely no credibility when it comes to dolphins talk same thing with gildy and the panthers now gildy has

[01:51:56.020 --> 01:52:01.400]
He threw a little bit of a weak shot here in here. Oh, I noticed was it David Janeyle again on Sunday in the herald

[01:52:02.700 --> 01:52:05.080]
Second Rick Dudley's ass in there about what a great job

[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:08.300]
He didn't tap on how this team is in the right direction. I mean, you know

[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:12.120]
I would think that my fellow panther fans out there should be starting a little bit of an impatient

[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:15.860]
They got a lot of good young players, but this business with the youngsters in the organization

[01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:21.200]
We've been hearing that for about a hundred years already and missing the playoffs their 12 points out of it right now

[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:25.400]
And it'll be probably worse at the end of the season in the next few days. I mean, what are we talking about?

[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:27.300]
What's the point?

[01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:31.060]
Never less. He says whoever this is

[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:36.940]
As for the asshole who wants a fun pool. How about what is your favorite month of the year?

[01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:42.500]
And then he lists them all there. There you go. What did he list them? We could take calls

[01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:49.660]
Yeah, what's your favorite is this idiot fax me this crap again here this other guy. Oh

[01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:51.820]
Jesus god

[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:57.280]
He goes on to say it sure seems when I listen to the Mosho that gildy's getting kind of a sick of the pistol

[01:52:57.300 --> 01:53:01.140]
He's a maybe that's why he smelled so bad this morning. I'm seriously he smelled like he had

[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:02.460]
dumped himself

[01:53:03.340 --> 01:53:07.320]
His tone seems to be like get me out of here as quickly as possible. Is this just my imagination?

[01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:09.940]
No, or do you think there may be some truth to that? Uh-huh

[01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:13.740]
As you mentioned many times they hear players thanking God for the great game they played

[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:15.700]
I'm happy that God was in Ohio State fan

[01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:21.940]
But I wonder when there were days like yesterday with a bunch of games going on baseball basketball and hockey how God can pull all that off

[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:26.280]
Ha he works in mysterious ways. He's everywhere. Don't you know a lot of TV?

[01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:29.880]
He is everywhere. That's right. He's got more TVs than normal can't then rumor

[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:32.980]
In closing which beach are you giving free tickets to?

[01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:36.900]
Yeah, let's get free tickets to the new beach in adania

[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:42.200]
What about the new hellendale beaches that still air all their old perverts are up in the woods with their binoculars

[01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:46.260]
Yeah, is that they still doing that? Yeah, that's in date south of hellendale

[01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:53.160]
It starts with an h so I can see how you'd confuse it. Did I say hellendale? Yeah, I'm at a hell over

[01:53:53.160 --> 01:54:01.160]
Right, it's basically open all blends together plus I'm old. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T in Verizon

[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:04.040]
Wireless line. Let's get these phones going here, baby

[01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:08.720]
We're smoking on this end today. We're absolutely smoking a big fat one and you people are

[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:11.900]
Look at that. Yeah, please

[01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:19.400]
Very very sad. How does it just cannot keep it up? I used to it doesn't make it any better. No, you know that yeah

[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:27.220]
Expecting it yes, but not being depressed look at that one line bringing on a phone with a QIM I see our cool. There you go. That's him again

[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:30.100]
That's him again. That's it. That's our call

[01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:32.040]
He's a never die die hard

[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:36.960]
Meaning what if there's one line ringing? Oh, it's him. That's right. Then that's quite a commentary too

[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:41.620]
Okay, and that's why assholes like him get an over and over again because even on this high price show where we're

[01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:47.260]
Disposed trying to give an alternative to the same old right wing bull crap over and over again and they still won't call they still got nothing to say

[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:53.140]
This is the place that will give you nothing they give you nothing in return

[01:54:54.900 --> 01:55:01.760]
No matter how difficult you stand on your head and they give you nothing in return they give you good zets

[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:03.400]
Red and you old back them

[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:05.340]

[01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:19.860]
All right the fun stuff. Yeah, there's no such drop-in

[01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:24.420]
We have one where he says Howard David's a bitch. You have that one get out of here

[01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:29.440]
What are you looking for the drop? It's not called the fun stuff. What is it called? I don't know

[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:31.340]
I know what you're talking about I know the

[01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:33.460]
Teets and we don't need that

[01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:38.600]
Well, it's another one. He's requesting drop-ins. Yeah, that's the material we got from the audience

[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:43.740]
Can we please hear Howard David's a bitch again? The old Howard David's a bitch. Okay. There you go

[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:48.280]
There's that one and then you know what they probably also want to hear and see if it's today. How about the bleep? There you go

[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:53.140]
Good god and you're looking for that. I can't find it

[01:55:55.580 --> 01:56:02.260]
Because you're not looking under the right spot. Okay. I know exactly where to fall. Oh, no something just happened on here

[01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:06.800]
Oh, no that purple thing came up again. You're looking for caca poop

[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:29.440]
You know you just get old artsy fartsy and it's no fun anymore

I know the fun stuff when I see it. Okay, mister. You just know don't don't get it all pita

[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:48.320]
10 past 11. What do you and boy? I was quite a visit. I had a great visit with

[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:52.880]
Modus morning Greg Reid my close personal buddy came in here today. Oh

[01:56:53.620 --> 01:57:00.080]
Most of the straight in the eye. No seriously. He's actually I got look. I try to be fair. Okay. Most of the time he's disappointing

[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:04.800]
That's an understatement most of the time he lets us down and again

[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:08.020]
Some of that in all fairness is not him. It's his partners the bees

[01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:12.500]
You know the living in the treehouse crowd over there in Naples corporate but

[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.660]
In this particular case we have to give him a high mark

[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:19.220]
So I'm not sure it's gonna happen again anytime soon. We give him a high marks

[01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:21.420]
Which means maybe he's hanging around and healing a lot in the building

[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:33.600]
Jack Cuban airliner headed to Florida. All right. Hey, too. Well congratulations get alive

Know is the answer she wants to drink wine have conversations and basically explore our feelings for each other

[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:20.080]

So we've decided to just be friends who don't even speak to each other too much a lot

[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:30.200]
I'm doing some public appearances to the tune of 15 grand of pop

Tonight I got some women's book club meeting they'll pass those taxes in which I sit in a chair like at the Palmestore

If Bush is so religious why does he favor the big corporations and the rich while surrounding himself with corporate

[01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:30.160]
Multimillionaires is this what Jesus would do as time shut up

[01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:33.500]
Oh Jesus must have been a pretty good businessman look at the gigantic corporation. He's invented

[01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:38.000]
Roof or his disciples invent excuse me

[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:44.600]
A war of words over setting pornography to the troops says this uh, I don't I want to read all this stuff

[01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:48.880]
I don't want to do it. You know what I mean? I'm burned out for a day. I don't want to read all this important story

[01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:50.780]
It is we love our troops

[01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:57.420]
They're good enough to die for us, but they can't have any naked pictures before they die because we're Christians that's for damn sure

[01:59:59.140 --> 01:59:59.540]
Yeah

[02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:07.600]
Try to pollute the mines and the hearts of our service people overseas the same owners that are in favor of the war

[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:11.920]
Are opposed to them getting playboy. Yeah. Well, that's because the right wingers are running out

[02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:14.680]
They don't want to lose their copy

[02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:21.120]
408 votes on a poll today on neo-rodgers.com. We're having a pretty interesting day today. It's kind of a little disjointed

[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:27.880]
You hear this joint to me and you have your own joint over there. Thanks everybody's smoking in a building. They buy a word

[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:34.900]
Fat Greg was in here passing out big fat ones to everybody. I didn't get mine. Well except you. He hates you

[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:37.380]
408 votes. How does religion

[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:43.660]
Permit the carnage of the war in Iraq and even if you're in favor of the war if you're gungho

[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:49.340]
You must admit that there's plenty of human carnage already in the war's only a few days old and there's gonna be a lot more

[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:52.600]
Hopefully not, but that just isn't realistic

[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:56.240]
Religious fanaticism is at the root of the problem

[02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:01.220]
217 very perspicacious people see that just like they saw 9 11 and all these fanatical

[02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:05.820]
Muslims and fanatical Christians and fanatical everybody because fanatical speaks for itself

[02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:10.400]
Because they got the answers and they're gonna make this an offer we can't refuse

[02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:19.220]
Isn't that what the Sodom Hussein said and probably I think that's what bush said if we actually find the Sodom can't find it

[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:26.100]
Huh? Oh under the godfather. Yeah, I can't find it. Oh here. That's what we're gonna do. W is gonna go over there

[02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:29.380]
I want to make them an offer to go with you. There you go. I wasn't even worth it

[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:36.920]
Uh, even the Lord loves neo-rodgers 63 votes. I don't think I did this right. God doesn't care. He's busy with ballgame 78

[02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:38.980]
Even the Lord loves neo-rodgers 63

[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:42.520]
It doesn't the 10 commandments say they'll shout not kill 27

[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:47.480]
It's self-defense God will allow it 15 and God wants us to kill the enemies eight

[02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:53.300]
So the God squad ain't doing too good on our poll today even with the creeping and Jeepers creepers. It's mr

[02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:56.780]
Freeper how come they're not voting for that they have read their bible you think

[02:01:57.340 --> 02:02:02.900]
I know maybe they're too old and they can't they don't have a computer maybe that's my opinion all of steves 90 plus audience

[02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:07.700]
Hello Steve. I heard Randy Rhodes the other day enjoys Kaufman and they said you're a douchebag

[02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:14.180]
You know that that stuff. Yeah exactly stuff that makes you a tea-thick like hearing people talk about sports on a radio hours a day

[02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:17.760]
Oh, good to make you know I'm educated to that

[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:23.020]
Do you think we don't have two of them in the same marketplace that would be in salad be bad

[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:24.860]
W Q a m

I beg your pardon. Yes, sir. Speaking

[02:02:29.140 --> 02:02:35.900]
Hey, bad boy. No, how do I know it the moment I heard that's because he had his boyfriend in the back gay WQ a

[02:02:36.780 --> 02:02:39.160]
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to me. Oh, please speaking

[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:40.640]
me no

[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:48.000]
I'm one of those 95% you talk about that I listened to you for 10 years and never called yes, sir

[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:49.760]
Yeah, I'm eight percent

[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:55.500]
Well whatever the figure was I wanted to call you five years ago when you were a resident against

[02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:58.520]
Wayne Heisenga. Yeah, the worst

[02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:01.160]
corporate entity ever

[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:05.660]
But now I have another question for you. Oh, I didn't know there was the first question go ahead

[02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:06.740]
um

[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:10.160]
Yeah

[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:10.900]
um

[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:20.880]
How many tens do you think Saddam Hussein would kill if you had a chance to opportunity a nuclear bomb whatever

[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:27.860]
I mean, how many you think he'd kill if you had a chance how many Christians you think he would kill I mean Americans do you think he'd tell a

[02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:29.400]
So so so what does that mean?

[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:36.380]
Well, some some time maybe we got a straw line. What do you want what are you whining about?

[02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:42.260]
Well, I'm sorry that come across as whining like the first president bush you're whining

[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:43.880]
Well

[02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:49.800]
All right, well, let me ask you this how many Americans you think Stalin would have killed

[02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:52.960]
You yeah, did he yeah

[02:03:54.940 --> 02:04:03.160]
Sir, let me ask you again, sir. Let me say this to you. Okay, Joseph Stalin killed millions and millions of his own people, okay

[02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:08.760]
Ha 16 whatever the hell number was. I mean, I'm not counting at this point the fact of the matter is that he killed any Americans

[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:10.620]
Didn't he have weapons of mass destruction?

[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:14.400]
Didn't he have biological weapons? Didn't he have every kind of weapon ever invented sir?

[02:04:15.660 --> 02:04:16.440]
I'm not talking

[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:20.380]
Okay, good what kind of a call is that

[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:27.340]
Is that for serious or is he joking should have stuck with his instincts? Oh my god stick with a 95% pal

[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:33.660]
God, I don't mind listening to anybody, but when you start whining like that had to be a joke

[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:39.580]
How many peppers could Peter Piper peck don't start with that pecker stuff again, okay? What that was wrong with you

[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:43.320]
By the way fat boy what did he want? I

[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:48.500]
I tried to um help him by not passing along his

[02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:53.120]
crap what was it was certainly better not have been about food

[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:57.120]
No, I see and I can tell because you already listen to this

[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:02.660]
I want the audience to listen very carefully. This is the most important thing you'll hear all day except when Duff came in here and said

[02:05:02.660 --> 02:05:03.680]
In the background

[02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:10.020]
Although thankfully the mic was off you're okay, my Duff. I think the microphone was awful check the tape because if anybody hears that word

[02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:11.520]
It was Duff Lindsay

[02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:18.360]
But anyway, it has to do with food the reason I know that is because already you have asked me don't even ask

[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.620]
Okay, don't ask and I won't tell got it

[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:28.400]
Didn't I say very clearly while I'm here for these couple of weeks or three? How far I can stand it

[02:05:28.900 --> 02:05:34.980]
I'm not gonna be eating food when I'm in Toronto do you hear me eating on the air and the reason you don't hear me eating on the air is because I am not

[02:05:34.980 --> 02:05:37.980]
I think you're in a half I've been doing shows up there on and off

[02:05:37.980 --> 02:05:43.820]
I've had like two pieces of cheese combined the whole time I've been up there a raw weeny and one raw weeny

[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:48.600]
That's right the crystal near business. Yeah, but and that's it. Yeah, and you're in a half

[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:52.100]
I come back here. I just had a sir. You see I'm gonna tell you something

[02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:59.480]
I cannot stand most fat people I'll make exceptions because like fat rich is a good friend of mine and Zack's a good guy here

[02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:03.320]
We have anybody all in the beast that I don't I'm not he's now seriously. I'm like

[02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:03.780]
Uh

[02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:08.700]
Men's amends with him you know what I mean no yeah come see come saw

[02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:11.060]
I can take him or leave him

[02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:15.740]
But most fat people aren't satisfied just to be fat their food pushers

[02:06:15.740 --> 02:06:19.760]
How long are we talked about that on this guy damn show and it's so frustrating to me

[02:06:20.460 --> 02:06:23.760]
It's so freaking frustrating to me that we've got people like that

[02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:27.280]
This is a man who's wobbling around his place on a walker

[02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:33.000]
Whose hip is given out whose whole body is given up because he weighs 50,000 pounds. He's a fat tub of crap

[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:39.160]
When power 96 used to give away candy in promotional stuff they were doing he would break into the goddamn promotions

[02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:42.160]
Department and steal the candy and shovel it down his push

[02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:47.900]
Now I will grant you that I've all been eating disorders. I know as well as anybody else what they are but

[02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:54.400]
It's not important that you succeed and stay alive. It's important that other fat people fail

[02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:57.820]
Well, he wants to take as many people with him as right well. I'm not going with the fat boy

[02:06:57.820 --> 02:07:00.380]
Stay the hell away from me. PD Lenny's gone

[02:07:00.740 --> 02:07:05.100]
That's one god. Thank god for that. No wonder I mean he's noticed what a good mood I'm in today

[02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:09.480]
Bonded with Moe Greg came in with a big smile on his push. We had a wonderful exchange here

[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:13.320]
Talked about his that call we had yesterday. Was he found I guess I'm gonna be using

[02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:15.960]
By the way, do you know he's oh no?

[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:20.420]
Why does he think nobody knows that? I mean, I guess he doesn't really care

[02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:24.400]
But I mean, why does he think we don't know that? I mean, I'm never even here. I still know that

[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:29.880]
You know PD Lenny calls me up, but I mean, but he's gonna be all the information because he's a yenta

[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:34.700]
He's poison PD Lenny. We don't need a yenta like that in here. He's a he's a mole and a troll

[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:36.220]
He is

[02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:40.820]
With a big pie hole, but she can't shut a mole and a troll and a big pie hole

[02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:44.500]
But anyway with no soul

[02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:48.840]
Like the son of West Virginia to dig some coal

[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:53.560]
Anyway, what was that saying about Greg? No, it was about high point about fat boy

[02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:58.160]
I'm not putting up with your craft anymore. I don't want any goddamn food in here while I'm here

[02:07:58.160 --> 02:08:01.360]
This isn't Nelly's restaurant. It's a radio studio. So at least

[02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:03.280]
It's studio-ish

[02:08:04.380 --> 02:08:05.760]
Yeah, it's a radio-ish

[02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:10.520]
This isn't the place I realize a lot of other people get ready to eat lunch right now

[02:08:10.520 --> 02:08:13.460]
Not me. I can wait till one thirty when I get home. I can wait

[02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:15.400]
I got my black sack from balance for life

[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:17.760]
I got some beautiful stuff and air laid out in fact you know

[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:22.800]
I'm gonna have one I get home a bokeh burger. Hey, yeah with nice slice of onion tomato made out of people

[02:08:23.220 --> 02:08:26.480]
Yeah, it's made out of people and what's wrong with eating people for lunch?

[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:31.300]
You eat the butt eat the whole damn thing. Yeah, I don't start with him. Okay. He'd uh. Yeah. Sorry

[02:08:31.300 --> 02:08:35.580]
I was wrong with you. Good old days. Trying to remember when he used to be our friend. Are you sure?

[02:08:35.660 --> 02:08:37.340]
Well, he never was our friend. We found that out

[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:42.220]
And then of course you see you see how people show their true colors the way he turned off

[02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:44.220]
All I did is make one very light criticism

[02:08:44.220 --> 02:08:48.620]
I said I didn't like his syndicated show as much as when he was on we working with him on iod right away

[02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:53.940]
Turned on me like a rat. I can't deal with that. I can't deal with people like if you don't suck up to them every man

[02:08:53.940 --> 02:08:58.220]
Like like the goddess. Yeah. Oh, well, he didn't support me on that one thing that one time

[02:08:58.220 --> 02:09:02.560]
Whatever the hell it was that iod. I stood up for that bitch. I mean for her every minute of the way

[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:05.800]
Okay, even when she was bombing dying in the afternoon

[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:09.500]
dying a wicked death and I still stood up for her

[02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:16.140]
But because I didn't stand up for something she said or whatever. Oh right away. I let her down. I can't deal with people like that. Okay

[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:19.960]
I'll stand up for you when I think you're right and when you're full of crap

[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:23.720]
I'll say hey, guess what? I think this time they may be full of crap or maybe I just won't say anything

[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:25.940]
How dare you yeah

[02:09:26.700 --> 02:09:33.040]
So as far as our good close former friend uh, are you yeah pissed off and disgusted with your whole ambiance with your whole thing

[02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:36.620]
Just what they need is another large ass junior

[02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:42.560]
Just what they need very disartony. It's it's tragic

[02:09:43.340 --> 02:09:49.020]
Howard Stern Phil Henry the voices of reason the voices of amusement the voices with balls

[02:09:49.540 --> 02:09:52.840]
It's interesting now how all of a sudden Greg's got the balls and they lost theirs

[02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:55.200]
Maybe he stole their balls all the pendulum swings

[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:59.240]
Hey, well, that's right the sack swing right under your peda uh, huh

[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:02.080]
God

[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:05.440]
What am I getting all well and I'm not reading this guy's back

[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:07.660]
Tim in primitive finds I can't deal with you you're an idiot

[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:10.060]
Go away don't fax me ever again

[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:15.220]
The Dutch connection says French guys are beating everyone doing

[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:20.740]
167 times a year. Oh, this is in Dutch. I guess about how many times you have sex per year

[02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:27.460]
I can't because it shows condoms and you know the Dutch it's all yeah, let me tell you something about the Dutch. They're not sexy people

[02:10:28.580 --> 02:10:32.940]
Sexy as in wanting it or getting no, no either one. Oh, they're not like what I would call no

[02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:36.440]
It's like when you go to Amsterdam and forget about the Dutch which will be easy to do

[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:42.740]
It's the people who visit there to reach those who come from all over the world to cut loose and have a great time and wild and they're great

[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:48.620]
But as far as the Dutch are concerned they're about as sexually as exciting as a uh, uh, Josh Friedman

[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:50.720]
So let's see France

[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:55.440]
167 times a year they're screwing needle on see what I mean Netherlands 158

[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:02.960]
Denmark 152 Canada 150 a lot of sex in Canada baby. Oh, there that many straight people

[02:11:03.580 --> 02:11:07.120]
150 high-heavens in Germany great Britain 149

[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:08.980]
Deutschland 147

[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:46.280]
That's what we ought to resurrect. I like that thing. That was funny. It was a

[02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:47.800]
It was a good moment. We did have the one really

[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:51.260]
Pretty good looking young couple on here and they one hands down. We gave them a nice prize

[02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:54.400]
It was an impromptu the prizes just had a materialized. I didn't know what to do

Right. By the way, the Brits are taking a whipping in buster. They're a lot of casualties. Oh really?

[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:12.100]
Unfortunately, I had no idea. Yeah

[02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:13.820]
Have a number

[02:12:13.820 --> 02:12:18.640]
I don't have a number and even if we did have a number we know the numbers aren't accurate anyway

[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:21.000]
Oh god

[02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:24.880]
I don't know how many Brits have died. Maybe I'll give you a just make it up

Virgin Mary

[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:23.400]
Who's with the speed of bug the sound

[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:27.400]
Sector that dies straight to hell

[02:14:28.900 --> 02:14:30.740]
When the building starts to go

[02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:32.700]
We go even then we know

[02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:34.520]
Your crushing from it

[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:35.760]

Virgin

[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:44.800]
Virgin

[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:49.920]
Here's a message for Jeff. Hi

[02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:51.320]
Hi, a pally

[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:53.160]
Don't ever come in here again when I'm in this room

[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:55.760]
Don't ever come in here again. I'm serious. He just makes me

[02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:57.040]
He makes my skin crawl

[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:01.860]
Here is a man who can barely function as a human being

[02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:04.020]
And trying to spread his fats to everybody else

[02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:08.120]
The date of my stroke was February the 10th

[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:10.520]
Mark it down on your own tattoo on his ass

[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:12.960]
Right large letters

[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:14.000]
I have plenty of room

[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.880]
February 10th. Today is April 1st. No fooling

[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:17.360]
Okay

[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:19.860]
So it's like a month and a half later

[02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:21.960]
And this man is trying to force feed me crap

[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:23.320]
For his own fun and profit

[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:26.020]
Of course he what he's going to like grab on to some of it

[02:15:26.020 --> 02:15:26.380]
Naturally

[02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:28.280]
Probably most of it

[02:15:29.380 --> 02:15:31.300]
And then we'll give a bunch of plugs

[02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:33.980]
First of all, and either one of the places he's trying to bring food in here

[02:15:33.980 --> 02:15:36.300]
From our honest advertising on the show

[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:37.040]
Right

[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:38.640]
Am I right about that? Yeah, at the moment

[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:41.360]
Correct. As a matter of fact, one of them I don't think ever did

[02:15:42.380 --> 02:15:42.700]
Right

[02:15:42.700 --> 02:15:44.360]
So what's the point?

[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:46.640]
What is the point?

[02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:49.300]
Free food that I have to do him a favor to make myself sick

[02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:51.980]
To make Jeff high happy about his neurosis with fat

[02:15:51.980 --> 02:15:55.460]
You're a sick, disgusting fat tub of crap

[02:15:55.460 --> 02:15:56.400]
Okay fat boy

[02:15:57.020 --> 02:16:00.080]
And it's too bad the sabers didn't fold up just to spite you all the way

[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:01.060]
Do like Rick Generad

[02:16:01.060 --> 02:16:02.360]
And Jim Lorentz

[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:04.120]
You make me sick fat boy

[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:05.420]
You make me nauseous okay

[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:08.680]
Don't ever come near this studio okay

[02:16:09.300 --> 02:16:11.280]
You make Josh Friedman look like Robbie Benson

[02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:15.080]
You make a Julio look just like bad pit

[02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:16.540]
That's right

[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:19.980]
You make the beast look just like Tom Brady

[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:25.860]
So don't you dare bring your fat tub of waddling crap anywhere near my studio

[02:16:25.860 --> 02:16:28.580]
Ever again you sack a crap you

[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:32.420]
You big fat disgusting smelly turd burger you

[02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:34.080]
Don't hold back what do you try to say?

[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:34.900]
I hate his guts

[02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:38.060]
And boy that's a lot of hate to spread around

[02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:40.060]
That's about 500 pounds worth I hate

[02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:43.960]
And I don't hate much even moan I bonded briefly this morning

[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:44.900]
That's right

[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:53.440]
Anyway the reason I played virgin man I got a little side track on that tub of turd

[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:56.240]
A controversial new Vatican glossary of sexual term says

[02:16:56.240 --> 02:17:00.100]
Homosexuals are not normal in the countries which allow gay marriages are inhabited by people

[02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:04.760]
Which profoundly with profoundly disordered minds according to the Vatican cities new sex glossary

[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:10.760]
Italy's gay community immediately condemned the glossary of nearly 900 pages which hit the bookstores yesterday

[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:13.880]
It's part of what they call a new anti homosexual crusade

[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:18.860]
The glossary prepared by the Vatican's pontifical council for the family covers themes such as

[02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:22.760]
Sexuality condoms abortion birth control and genetic manipulation

[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:25.600]
Thank God there ain't any other other kind of manipulation cover

[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:27.120]
There's no fact in the church

[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:33.400]
A section on homosexuality in homophobia says homosexuality stems from an unresolved psychological conflict

[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:36.840]
Like fat people trying to force feed you food I think maybe they got a point

[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:37.800]
Fat boy

[02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:41.900]
It says those who want to give homosexuals the same legal rights in society

[02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:45.980]
Then I a psychological problem which makes homosexuality against the social fabric

[02:17:45.980 --> 02:17:49.120]
And you talk about the pot calling the kettle pink man

[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:53.300]
The Vatican the Catholic church with their swish guard

[02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:56.400]
Which is just overrun by nothing but a bunch of pansies

[02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:01.640]
This is just unbelievable and for the guy to call before I do separate the pedophiles the child molesters

[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:04.520]
From the other priest who happen to be gay but aren't child molesters

[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:07.880]
necessarily necessarily but the necessarily so

[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:15.820]
But talk about an institution that's just run and overrun with the fags man the Catholic church

[02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:20.240]
And here they are again pointed at hypocrites the biggest hypocrites in the world

[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:21.600]
Well it's part of the scam

[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:24.140]
And then again for the Pope to be talking about the killing in Iraq

[02:18:24.140 --> 02:18:28.720]
One institution what religious institution is killed more innocent people than all the others put together

[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:30.100]
Could be the Catholic church could it

[02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:33.840]
Oh millions during the crusades in the Inquisition

[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:35.480]
Millions millions

[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:37.820]
That's right

[02:18:40.140 --> 02:18:42.320]
Good golly miss Molly I'll find it this time

[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:44.720]
And of course how did they convert all those people?

[02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:46.240]
I want to make them an Alfred Gowdy

[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:50.900]
There you go that's right that was the first bunch of Catholics who used that line before Marlon Brando

[02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:52.300]
I want to make them an Alfred Gowdy

[02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:54.300]
Okay go have some lunch Marlon, it's too late for you anyway

[02:18:54.300 --> 02:18:57.380]
In fact why don't we send Fat boy off to Marlon Brando's joint

[02:18:57.380 --> 02:18:57.860]
Huh?

[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:00.720]
Can't hurt at this point and they can borrow

[02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:05.240]
They can both do that fatso routine together you know what the feeding friends eat together

[02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:05.940]
The two of them

[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:07.180]
They can have an orange

[02:19:07.180 --> 02:19:08.500]
I like lunch and cook them

[02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:10.120]
Yeah I like lunch and cook them too okay

[02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:16.600]
Oh my god what a pleasure it is to be back here in South Florida

[02:19:17.260 --> 02:19:17.580]
Not

[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:21.420]
Fine am I getting a little worked up here today?

[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:23.360]
No it's great because I'm starting to feel a little bit better right now

[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:24.700]
I'm starting to get my life back

[02:19:24.700 --> 02:19:27.140]
Had that great bonding with Mo and Greg all in one day

[02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:27.960]
Didn't eat no crap

[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:30.500]
Sorry by the way Greg I didn't mean to put you in the same category with Mo

[02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:34.700]
Here's a call on line 9 WQAM not there

[02:19:34.700 --> 02:19:36.880]
What a shame now I'd have been important I'd have been from Axtabula

[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:39.180]
I might have been from Solano Ohio

[02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:40.700]
Home of Jim Mad Dog Manage

[02:19:40.700 --> 02:19:42.560]
I might have been from Finley Ohio

[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:43.700]
Home of Joe Marsh Jr

[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:46.740]
What are you laughing about?

[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:48.560]
Nothing I'm gonna get that sight open up again

[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:49.280]
Joe Marsh Jr

[02:19:50.020 --> 02:19:50.420]
Yeah

[02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:53.420]
Might have been from Ashua Ontario

[02:19:53.900 --> 02:19:56.420]
Or Mrs. Saga Ontario Home of Don Sherry

[02:19:57.980 --> 02:20:00.380]
Might have been from Kingston Ontario Home of Doug Gilmore

[02:20:00.380 --> 02:20:01.340]
I can't come on let's go

[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:03.740]
Here is WQAM

[02:20:04.180 --> 02:20:05.260]
Neil yes sir

[02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:07.980]
That's a couple of operations at the bottom of the game last night

[02:20:07.980 --> 02:20:09.100]
There's a pretty good crowd

[02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:12.480]
You know why? You're giving away a free hot dog

[02:20:12.480 --> 02:20:13.640]
That's what I've been saying all morning

[02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:14.720]
Unbelievable right

[02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:17.720]
It was the lines of the snack bar were around the blocks

[02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:18.080]
Right

[02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:21.260]
They were on a pack that you went every day

[02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:22.860]
Free bobble head dolls, free caps

[02:20:22.860 --> 02:20:25.860]
And they can just give a bunch of crap away free to have thousands in every game

[02:20:25.860 --> 02:20:27.000]
And no one was there

[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:28.840]
But they have a new thing

[02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:30.380]
The waterless urinal

[02:20:31.420 --> 02:20:32.720]
The waterless urinal

[02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:35.120]
Big news I understand

[02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:36.900]
Everybody's talking about it in the building

[02:20:36.900 --> 02:20:37.960]
What is it?

[02:20:38.060 --> 02:20:39.840]
The urinal with no water

[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:41.200]
Just going there

[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:43.520]
And when they're leaking do not step near them

[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:44.280]
It was not water

[02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:45.960]
They were leaking in the last night

[02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:46.400]
It was gross

[02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:49.520]
But you have to go to the bathroom there's no water, you just pee in it

[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:51.900]
And I guess air and gravity takes it away

[02:20:51.900 --> 02:20:54.600]
So there's no water running in the urinal

[02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:55.480]
Uh-huh

[02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:57.720]
It's pretty gross

[02:20:57.720 --> 02:20:58.560]
Oh great

[02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:01.840]
Good luck guys, just wear our swissers in there

[02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:02.440]
Okay

[02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:08.020]
It was the talk of the town

[02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:09.120]
Was the waterless urinal

[02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:11.720]
Maybe that's why they called it PP Park

[02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:12.760]
Front page news, yeah

[02:21:13.420 --> 02:21:14.940]
Maybe they can change the name to

[02:21:14.940 --> 02:21:17.260]
Park taking a leak next to Gary Sarner

[02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:19.160]
He was all talking about it

[02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:20.100]
Big news

[02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:20.780]
But you mean here?

[02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:22.240]
Yeah, in our regular units

[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:25.540]
Oh Gary Sarner, you know he's a real jocsner for he's another one of those

[02:21:26.740 --> 02:21:28.180]
He's another one of that crowd

[02:21:28.180 --> 02:21:30.140]
The sports mafia here at QAM

[02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:33.860]
In addition to which beside the fact that he's one of those

[02:21:33.860 --> 02:21:34.660]
He's an asshole

[02:21:34.660 --> 02:21:35.360]
Yeah, besides

[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:38.160]
Haven't seen him since I've been back and you know what

[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:39.140]
Thank God

[02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:41.240]
PD Lenny we got rid of

[02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:44.020]
Gary Sarner, he stays in his cubicle back there

[02:21:44.020 --> 02:21:45.560]
It stayed the hell away from me which is fine

[02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:48.140]
If you're getting the feeling that most of the sales people get on my nerves

[02:21:48.140 --> 02:21:49.520]
You're right, no, no, don't miss it

[02:21:49.980 --> 02:21:51.460]
Adam's a good guy, saw him this morning

[02:21:51.460 --> 02:21:52.480]
And we like Adam a lot

[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:53.220]
Gary has an office

[02:21:53.780 --> 02:21:56.300]
I don't care what he's got an orifice, he's got a big orifice

[02:21:56.300 --> 02:21:58.480]
I'll hear it out, I'm one of those cubicle people

[02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:01.180]
I don't care what he's got, he's part of the inner circle

[02:22:01.180 --> 02:22:02.680]
Uh-huh, that's why he has an office

[02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:03.020]
Right

[02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:06.520]
And once I just started to say there was so much more important

[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:08.400]
Oh yeah, I'm trying to say Adam we like in sales

[02:22:08.780 --> 02:22:10.580]
Skippy, you know Skippy is a goofball

[02:22:10.580 --> 02:22:13.000]
But he's okay, at least he's not, he's benign

[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:14.360]
He's not malignant, right?

[02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:15.020]
See what I'm saying?

[02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:17.620]
Raymond's a nice guy but Tommy hates him because he can't write copy

[02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:19.340]
Raymond? Ray?

[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:21.540]
Who's Ray? I think you've met him one time

[02:22:21.540 --> 02:22:23.200]
That wasn't a guy that came in yesterday, the new guy?

[02:22:24.220 --> 02:22:24.840]
Different uh-

[02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:26.900]
The new guy is a sports, he's the sports sales guy

[02:22:26.900 --> 02:22:28.480]
He's not the one that she just, you know

[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:29.860]
I forgot his name already

[02:22:29.860 --> 02:22:30.620]
Do I know Raymond?

[02:22:31.340 --> 02:22:33.020]
I think you've met him once, it was a long time ago

[02:22:33.020 --> 02:22:34.320]
Time to tie Drek, see what I'm saying?

[02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:36.120]
Do I ever want to see him again?

[02:22:36.260 --> 02:22:36.360]
No

[02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:39.320]
And it's not me, I'm not just Hank will tell you the same thing

[02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:41.520]
Even Mo is starting to get on their case now

[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:44.080]
See, in the beginning all the sales people there are the best

[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:45.080]
You know he was sucking around with that

[02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:46.580]
He's onto them now, right?

[02:22:46.880 --> 02:22:47.720]
He knows what they're all about

[02:22:48.920 --> 02:22:50.940]
And then of course in a category by himself

[02:22:50.940 --> 02:22:51.900]
Hi, Italian!

[02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:54.480]
Right, who's busy talking about the toilet habits

[02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:56.880]
Busy splattering all over the walls in there

[02:22:56.880 --> 02:22:59.200]
And the handycrap compartment

[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:00.200]
Huh?

[02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:02.080]
Why do you think they call it a handycrap

[02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:06.860]
Oh god, I'm so glad I did not participate in viewing that scene

[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:09.340]
You're not the your back

[02:23:09.340 --> 02:23:10.400]
It's close to lunchtime

[02:23:10.400 --> 02:23:13.860]
Don't start regaining the audience with tales of fat boys

[02:23:14.380 --> 02:23:17.800]
And his little accident, his meat that door fell over the mind

[02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:18.720]
Oh my god

[02:23:19.260 --> 02:23:19.740]
Whoa

[02:23:19.740 --> 02:23:22.920]
Oh, you gotta play that did again now

[02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:25.060]
What the hell are you doing?

[02:23:25.060 --> 02:23:26.180]
Oh, okay, just calm down

[02:23:26.180 --> 02:23:28.420]
Just try to control yourself, okay?

[02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:29.340]
Hi, Italian!

[02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:29.980]
Get out of here!

[02:23:30.200 --> 02:23:33.080]
You tub a crap, go pedal your free food someplace else

[02:23:33.080 --> 02:23:33.960]
And not only that, but

[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:36.820]
Hey, all you homeowners out there

[02:23:36.820 --> 02:23:38.960]
There are a few things worse in life than a hot summer day

[02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:41.320]
Which is almost every day lately since it's an early summer here

[02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:44.140]
Then go out in the backyard for a nice refreshing relaxing swim

[02:23:44.140 --> 02:23:46.220]
You look into the pool and guess speaking of crap

[02:23:46.220 --> 02:23:48.320]
That's what it looks like in there, it looks like the end of the world

[02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:51.480]
Maybe it's stained, it's dirty, maybe it's cracking in your pool too

[02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:55.040]

[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:26.960]
Woo! I gotta get out of here, Pally!

[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:29.500]
Hey, how come the elevator won't work?

[02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:31.940]
Because you gotta use the stairs you stupid moron

[02:25:31.940 --> 02:25:33.840]
You're done fat-fasten you

[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:37.960]
Oh, hiya Howard! The stairs

[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:39.360]
That's right, Rotundle

[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:41.460]
I don't think I can...

[02:25:41.460 --> 02:25:42.700]
How do I wait, that's all?

[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:45.060]
Alright, so I have to go

[02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:47.240]
One step at a time

[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:53.780]
No, no, no!

[02:25:53.780 --> 02:25:55.420]
I will...

[02:25:55.420 --> 02:26:01.840]
My wheelchair...

[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:04.680]
Don't move, somebody help me

[02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:06.340]
Hey, how about you, Pally?

[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:07.900]
You wanna give me a hand?

[02:26:07.900 --> 02:26:08.660]
Of course, I...

[02:26:08.660 --> 02:26:12.400]
Please, I'm sorry, I'm gonna die

[02:26:13.180 --> 02:26:13.980]
Don't be...

[02:26:13.980 --> 02:26:16.240]
I might give me a hand, Pally, come on

[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:17.100]
I'm not sure

[02:26:17.100 --> 02:26:18.880]
Is there a port with the round?

[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:22.180]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[02:26:22.180 --> 02:26:23.540]
Maybe I can hide in your pants

[02:26:23.540 --> 02:26:24.620]
You mind me?

[02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:26.820]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[02:26:26.820 --> 02:26:28.940]
You can't wait, I know

[02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:30.440]
You can't save me, stop me, I know

[02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:33.040]
You can't eat some of my videos, I'm kinda queer

[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:34.440]
Hey, sorry

[02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:37.940]
Fine, nice knowing your high boy

[02:26:37.940 --> 02:26:42.020]
Just remember, Gaby, you can't put your arms around the memory

[02:26:42.020 --> 02:26:45.140]
I can't even put my arms around you

[02:26:45.140 --> 02:26:45.900]
Duh!

[02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:47.680]
Oh, no

[02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:52.560]
I think I...

[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:54.340]
I feel like

[02:26:54.340 --> 02:26:55.060]
The...

[02:26:55.060 --> 02:26:56.820]
I mean, this is part of my...

[02:26:56.820 --> 02:26:58.240]
In a Poseidon adventure

[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:01.060]
But at least he got to look up

[02:27:01.060 --> 02:27:02.460]
And tell his Steven's story

[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:06.060]
And shout it like this in a day

[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:09.060]
The King gave one hell of a laugh dance

[02:27:09.060 --> 02:27:12.240]
Oh, damn

[02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:14.020]
Oh, damn

[02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:14.340]
I made it

[02:27:14.940 --> 02:27:16.600]
All the way down the stairs

[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:18.260]
Mate, I have your attention

[02:27:18.260 --> 02:27:20.940]
This was a false alarm

[02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:23.180]
And it's been a real fire

[02:27:23.180 --> 02:27:25.420]
We've been spending 30 high boy

[02:27:25.420 --> 02:27:27.780]
And the next thousand tailgate party

[02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:30.580]

[02:27:31.220 --> 02:27:33.180]
Everyone back to your arvests

[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:35.060]
Fuck you, Patti

[02:27:37.020 --> 02:27:38.400]

[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:52.980]
U.S. Senator Bill Nelson accused the Bush administration yesterday

[02:27:52.980 --> 02:27:58.180]
They've intolerance by questioning the patriotism of those who publicly oppose the president's policies on the war or domestic issues

[02:27:58.180 --> 02:27:59.440]
Nice going, Billy!

[02:27:59.940 --> 02:28:01.680]
By the way, is it hot in here? Is it me?

[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:03.560]
It's boiling in here, let me go

[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:04.800]
Ah, no, I'll do it right

[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:06.360]
Right

[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:09.780]
Oh my God

[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:18.480]
Feels like they're cranking up the ovens in here if you catch my drift

[02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:19.640]
Speaking of this

[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:23.660]
There was an attempt to muzzle people who happened to disagree with specific policy, Nelson

[02:28:23.660 --> 02:28:25.900]
Said during a visit with state legislators in Tallahassee

[02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:27.980]
I have refused to be silent. Good for you, Billy!

[02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:28.240]
Oh!

[02:28:29.380 --> 02:28:35.320]
Senator Nelson cited the Pentagon's repeated rebuttals of remarks by the Army Senior Ground Commander in Iraq, Lt. General William Wallace

[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:39.320]
Wallace said last week that over extended supply lines in a combative adversary

[02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:44.500]
Using unconventional tactics had stalled the U.S. Drive toward Baghdad and increased the likelihood of a longer war

[02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:47.380]
That suggests an attitude problem, Nelson, said

[02:28:47.380 --> 02:28:53.280]
When a soldier makes a statement that is grounded in fact and an attempt has made the muzzle that soldier as if he's not speaking the truth

[02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:55.720]
That is dangerous precedent to set

[02:28:57.460 --> 02:28:58.580]
How do you like that?

[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:03.080]
Despite national polls indicating strong public support of the president and the war

[02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:07.500]
Nelson's comment, your way determination by the moderate Democrat to take a harder stand against Bush

[02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:09.160]
Especially on military matters

[02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:10.920]
Thank God for everybody named Nelson!

[02:29:11.180 --> 02:29:11.800]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:15.360]
Right on. I think that's where it's all at. Charles Nelson Riley, man

[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:17.420]
That's, yeah, while we're going to get rid of him

[02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:18.180]
Where is Nelson?

[02:29:18.460 --> 02:29:19.820]
We're going to deport him

[02:29:21.940 --> 02:29:23.220]
Tamikonos with the Greeks

[02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:27.140]
Lyndon Bokov-Faxes and said good faxes today by the way

[02:29:27.580 --> 02:29:29.560]
And we're interspersing with some call screenless

[02:29:29.940 --> 02:29:32.980]
Not too bad today, although we have another hour and 11 minutes to go, he is

[02:29:33.360 --> 02:29:38.580]
Anyway, Lyndon Bokov-Faxes, well I got to ease back into it, but you know not that I've bonded with Mobri for this morning

[02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:40.500]
Very briefly, don't get panicky

[02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:46.500]
Lyndon Bokov-Faxes, my wife's 13-year-old son told me that he was getting so upset with all the war coverage on TV

[02:29:46.500 --> 02:29:50.060]
It was disturbing him so much he announced he was not going to watch it anymore. Good for him

[02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:54.960]
He just wants to do his normal kid stuff like school, skateboarding and hanging out with his friends. Good

[02:29:55.460 --> 02:29:59.120]
The worrying about the war was too much for him. I thought about what he said and decided to follow it

[02:29:59.120 --> 02:30:02.240]
I don't watch constant TV news coverage. That way, Lyndon

[02:30:02.240 --> 02:30:04.580]
The night vision goggles would be a big hit out of here

[02:30:05.020 --> 02:30:06.460]
I don't quote every word to tale

[02:30:06.460 --> 02:30:11.260]
In the newspaper, talk about it at the dinner table. We are against the war. We support the troops who want them to come home soon

[02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:16.480]
But my son and I will not continue with his constant media barrage to our senses. It isn't healthy. And you're absolutely

[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:18.880]
Correct, Lyndon Bokov-Faxes.

[02:30:18.880 --> 02:30:22.720]
There's somebody better head on straight and her kid too. Wait till you hear this

[02:30:25.100 --> 02:30:27.940]
From the Australian. Is that that Adam bugging us again?

[02:30:32.580 --> 02:30:36.660]
Oh brother, I just want to make one comment. Okay, he's a pretty good guy but generally speaking

[02:30:36.660 --> 02:30:38.300]
Sales people are iceholes. Yeah

[02:30:39.480 --> 02:30:44.800]
US soldiers in Iraq asked to pray for Bush. Oh my god

[02:30:44.800 --> 02:30:48.520]
Exactly. They may be the ones facing danger on the battlefield

[02:30:48.520 --> 02:30:51.860]
But US soldiers in Iraq are being asked to pray for the president

[02:30:52.620 --> 02:30:55.780]
Thousands of Marines have been given a pamphlet called a Christian's duty

[02:30:56.740 --> 02:31:00.280]
A mini prayer book which includes a tear-out sex to be mailed to the White House

[02:31:00.280 --> 02:31:03.280]
Pledging the soldier who sends it has been praying for Bush

[02:31:03.280 --> 02:31:07.700]
And now I want you to stop and think about this okay because we have Jews in the military

[02:31:07.700 --> 02:31:11.140]
Right. We have atheists, diagnostics, and military have Muslims all of the time

[02:31:11.780 --> 02:31:14.900]
We have your hoavis witnesses. We have Buddhists and the Buddhists

[02:31:14.900 --> 02:31:17.700]
Traditional Native American voodoo

[02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:19.120]
Oh my god

[02:31:19.740 --> 02:31:21.800]
Talk about a Goyeshia takeover

[02:31:22.740 --> 02:31:27.220]
I have committed to pray for you, your family, your staff, and our troops during this time of uncertainty and tumult

[02:31:27.220 --> 02:31:32.300]
May God's peace be your guide since the pledge, according to a journalist embedded with coalition forces

[02:31:32.800 --> 02:31:35.940]
The pamphlet produced by a group called Intouch Ministries

[02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:39.720]
Offers a daily prayer to be made for the US president. They born again Christian

[02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:41.960]
Who likes to invoke his God in speeches

[02:31:41.960 --> 02:31:48.600]
Oh God. Sunday is prayed that the president and his advisors will see God in his wisdom daily and not rely on their own understanding

[02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:54.240]
Mondays prayer reads pray that the president and his advisors will be strong and courageous to do what is right regardless of critics

[02:31:54.880 --> 02:31:56.640]
Every day they got another one of these deals

[02:31:58.320 --> 02:32:00.800]
The pamphlet called a Christian's duty

[02:32:00.800 --> 02:32:05.120]
I want you people to understand what kind of group of people we're talking about running your country now

[02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:08.000]
Okay, don't you understand this, don't you see it? Are you that stupid?

[02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:10.020]
A Christian's duty

[02:32:13.740 --> 02:32:16.880]
What a slap in the face that is to every soldier

[02:32:16.880 --> 02:32:20.880]
All these people are putting their lives online for for these maniacs

[02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:26.880]
And again talking about total insensitivity lack of any kind of conscience whatsoever

[02:32:27.440 --> 02:32:29.080]
Shut up, he the yeah right

[02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:32.780]
Brother, what a disaster

[02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:37.360]
What a mitigated disaster for freedom in this country used to have some freedoms they're going fast

[02:32:38.260 --> 02:32:39.420]
I hear the stories

[02:32:39.420 --> 02:32:41.360]
Yeah, for offensive measures

[02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:43.040]
Now it's pretty offensive to me

[02:32:44.600 --> 02:32:45.040]
God

[02:32:45.900 --> 02:32:47.980]
Almost as offensive as one of our salespeople

[02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:48.880]
I don't want to mention no name

[02:32:48.880 --> 02:32:49.820]
I have how he

[02:32:49.820 --> 02:32:51.440]
488 votes on a poll

[02:32:52.140 --> 02:32:54.960]
How does religion permit the carnage of this war in Iraq

[02:32:54.960 --> 02:32:59.280]
Religious fanaticism is at the root of the problem 253 people say that

[02:32:59.900 --> 02:33:01.320]
51.8%

[02:33:02.020 --> 02:33:05.260]
God doesn't carry his busy with ball games 92 people say that

[02:33:05.260 --> 02:33:06.780]
Maybe his in Vegas would hank

[02:33:07.400 --> 02:33:10.820]
Even the Lord loves Neil Rogers 72 people know that for a fact

[02:33:10.820 --> 02:33:15.160]
It doesn't the 10 commandments say thou shalt not kill 39 people be saying that

[02:33:15.820 --> 02:33:21.180]
It's self-defense so God will allow a 29 and God wants us to kill all our enemies only 12

[02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:24.560]
I guess steepers creepers not too good a job by the creepers

[02:33:25.640 --> 02:33:29.420]
Right or they're in denial like to pretend the Bible doesn't say those I see

[02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:33.320]
About killing your enemies give pretty specific instructions

[02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:36.480]
And make sure you get every last one that just then that you can start with them

[02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:40.880]
Yeah, we don't wish any ill to any of our salespeople but if certain ones happen to stay home for a few months

[02:33:40.880 --> 02:33:44.160]
Hi, I thought we or at least until I get out of town again it will be very very pleasant

[02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:49.680]
The more I think about that it is I know the audience gets upset with me when I dwell on that but it's

[02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:51.820]
It's so unacceptable

[02:33:52.360 --> 02:33:56.380]
It is its behavior that is so outrageous and the fact that this radio station

[02:33:56.380 --> 02:34:00.560]
You know again we don't have any management here we just have a bunch of people wandering around sitting at desks

[02:34:01.300 --> 02:34:06.460]
The fact that they permit this is opposed to saying hey guess what you ask holes here in sales the man just had a stroke come up

[02:34:06.460 --> 02:34:09.480]
And I have a go his biggest problem is fat

[02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:14.460]
Quit trying to force feed him while he's here. Okay. He doesn't want it. You're funny

[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:21.420]
I'm serious that's the way that is the way a real place of business will operate

[02:34:21.420 --> 02:34:24.400]
I'm making the differentiation. I'm not talking about here

[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:29.060]
Okay, not a place that's radio wish or businesses issue. What does that have to do with closing and collecting?

[02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:30.480]
I see well first of all

[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:33.060]
We're not closing and collecting from any of the what do you have to do with sports?

[02:34:33.060 --> 02:34:39.500]
Let me say it again. It has nothing to do with sponsors or money because those people aren't spending a dime on this radio station

[02:34:39.500 --> 02:34:42.760]
Which makes it even more gallbladdering and I don't even have one anymore

[02:34:43.660 --> 02:34:47.060]
You jackass you fat tub of turd man you make me sick

[02:34:47.060 --> 02:34:49.060]
You make me nauseous

[02:34:49.620 --> 02:34:53.520]
You make me want to go on here and do hours and hours about you down to where to go to them treasure island

[02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:58.580]
Trying to get some bitch to touch any party your fat tubby body

[02:34:58.580 --> 02:35:01.060]
Down through the fence, right back when you go

[02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:21.260]
Hopefully without any success

[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.480]
Take your clothes off, you insist

[02:35:36.660 --> 02:35:39.740]
I'm gonna hold you down like a tuna fish

[02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:45.460]
Thinking of a big roll of this fat

[02:35:47.260 --> 02:35:51.580]
You know they buy the smell, which you can't wear it tight

[02:35:51.580 --> 02:35:53.320]
Paint dull

[02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:56.040]
Paint dull

[02:35:57.400 --> 02:35:58.680]
Paint dull

[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:00.540]
That's a big thing

[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:08.440]
Girls just depend on the little big fat guys

[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:13.580]
She know how to make the whole bed dry

[02:36:15.740 --> 02:36:18.360]
That men chase you to the shower now

[02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:23.680]
Who would leave the skin like on the towel

[02:36:25.260 --> 02:36:26.760]
Hands go

[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:29.440]
Hands go

[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:31.980]
Hands go

[02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:34.500]
That men get rid of

[02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:34.500]

[02:36:46.260 --> 02:36:47.640]
Hi, how are you?

[02:36:47.740 --> 02:36:48.440]
Oh brother

[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:51.880]
Here's some great factors

[02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:52.980]
I'll save them to life to the break

[02:36:52.980 --> 02:36:55.120]
I don't want to like law so good factors today

[02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:56.280]
God is here

[02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:58.100]
Audience really comes through big time

[02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:00.400]
And thank God

[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:25.080]
No God

To Steve Goldstein

[02:39:59.260 --> 02:40:00.480]
But you can call me Kelsey

[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:02.160]
Whenever I'm in town, I listen to

[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:03.600]
Wait a minute, I am in town

[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:05.440]
It's the 12th of one hour

[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:05.900]
Die!

[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:15.820]
We'll meet again

[02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:19.740]
If we don't wind up dead

[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:22.400]
From the bush cartel

[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:25.040]
Then left us all this way

[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:30.720]
We fall then to

[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:32.440]
Blind as a cold

[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:34.520]
It was our doom

[02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:36.660]
As the bonds drop

[02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:38.080]
From the stars

[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:40.060]
Going far away

[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:44.680]
Maybe we should have taken tension

[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:46.240]
A little bit more

[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:49.160]
To the fats we chose to ignore

[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:51.800]
The price of gas is declined

[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:56.900]
But I'm afraid that the lime won't be very large

[02:40:58.100 --> 02:41:00.220]
We'll meet again

[02:41:00.220 --> 02:41:01.800]
With a hole

[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:03.900]
That by the

[02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:07.580]
Civil rights will be restored

[02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:09.900]
One sunny day

[02:41:12.860 --> 02:41:15.460]
We'll meet again

[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:18.920]
If we don't wind up dead

[02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:21.120]
From the bush cartel

[02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:21.780]
Then left us all this way

[02:41:26.100 --> 02:41:29.200]
We'll meet again

[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:30.780]
With a hole

[02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:32.440]
That by the

[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:36.140]
Civil rights will be restored

[02:41:36.140 --> 02:41:39.060]
One sunny day

[02:41:39.060 --> 02:41:41.060]
We'll meet again

[02:41:41.060 --> 02:41:41.200]
If we don't wind up dead

[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:41.360]
From the bush cartel

[02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:43.320]
I'm getting out

[02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:48.060]
To the walls

[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:51.640]
A beautiful sized trunk

[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:51.780]
A beautiful kite

[02:41:51.780 --> 02:41:52.980]
It has just been easy

[02:41:52.980 --> 02:41:53.560]
The one, the big one

[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:53.560]

[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:56.380]
How is this creator good guy?

[02:41:58.040 --> 02:41:58.620]
How are the track guy?

[02:41:58.820 --> 02:42:01.440]
Well, he has many他

[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:03.000]
He is cool

[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:06.060]
But he is back

[02:42:06.060 --> 02:42:13.420]
I see he's a sales guy so I don't you know I don't generalize I deal with people as individuals the good ones the bad ones the evil doors

[02:42:14.820 --> 02:42:16.880]
The real real pains in the ass

[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:18.460]
Hi, I'm Ali like that

[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:24.200]
Here's one that says in honor of the pamphlet you talked about a Christian's duty. Could you please play the third phone call?

[02:42:24.460 --> 02:42:27.580]
A Christian's duty. Well, maybe we'll see

[02:42:28.220 --> 02:42:30.240]
We don't want to over we don't want to overwork that

[02:42:31.940 --> 02:42:38.480]
Tured and then one that says in touch ministries is Franklin Graham's organization needs the son of Billy Graham Franklin's been calling the religion of Islam evil

[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:43.280]
Remember that right after 9-11 he started with all that obnoxious crap and people said oh you doesn't do that

[02:42:43.280 --> 02:42:47.000]
That's an insult all the Muslims all over the world all one billion of them and he said well too bad, okay?

[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:48.360]
They're much of our business

[02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:52.840]
Shmata hands. He's right of course, but so are all the other ones. Yeah, right

[02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:56.080]
Well, I mean not not necessarily

[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:01.680]
How Buddhism's kind of benign benign as opposed to malignant I?

[02:43:02.940 --> 02:43:05.160]
Wouldn't say that any religions are Malignant

[02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:10.940]
It's the people who practice them the people who selectively take out the grotesque unacceptable obviously barbaric and

[02:43:10.940 --> 02:43:12.800]
Anti-human things and say oh yeah

[02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:16.000]
Well the Bible says this and the Bible says that those are the people who are evil doors

[02:43:16.980 --> 02:43:21.700]
Like the current crowd that we are that that thing about the troops if that doesn't frost the ass of a lot of people out there

[02:43:21.700 --> 02:43:26.640]
Kind of like you know come see come saw in the middle and take it where these people are coming from a

[02:43:28.340 --> 02:43:34.580]
Christians duty to our troops over there men women and otherwise hey converting to Christianity's for your own good

[02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:38.260]
I see it or don't well guess what W. Cox a hoist okay?

[02:43:40.260 --> 02:43:44.580]
Here's a fact this is hey Neil great. Sure was nice while last it, but looks like democracy is dead

[02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:46.040]
Absolutely

[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:48.580]
Correct sir, haven't I been saying it a long time?

[02:43:49.260 --> 02:43:54.740]
I've been since they stole the election that was the end of any a glimmer of democracy we used to have I've been seeing calls for censorship

[02:43:54.740 --> 02:43:59.680]
Orston in late 40s and early 50s some people are actually saying they want to bring back Joe McCarthy like it's a good thing

[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:03.260]
I rather bring back Charlie McCarthy Edgar Bergen and Mortimer snured

[02:44:04.100 --> 02:44:05.260]
What would Jesus do?

[02:44:05.340 --> 02:44:09.080]
It says he spoke out against the religious conservatives and protested frequently against the government

[02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:13.080]
He even participated in civil disobedience when he attacked the money changers in the temple

[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:16.040]
He overturned their tables and chased them with a horse whip

[02:44:16.900 --> 02:44:23.200]
Another misconception about Christianity is that it is just to kill in the case of punishment of evil one quote of Jesus

[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:26.620]
Forget about the splinter in your neighbor's eye and look at the beam in your eye

[02:44:26.620 --> 02:44:33.380]
We cannot criticize your act for their brutality when we're responsible for thousands of deaths here from questionable police shootings to selling arms to

[02:44:33.380 --> 02:44:37.420]
Desperate including Sodom all over the world. We have a truckload of four by 12's in our eye

[02:44:37.420 --> 02:44:44.680]
Christ also defended the prostitute about to be stoned by saying judge not less DB judge and those of you without sin cast the first stone

[02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:50.180]
I think that you I should clean up the injustice that is rampant here before we cast our stones in other countries

[02:44:50.180 --> 02:44:56.280]
Maybe I can have a big billboard with the president's support on it saying we got stones or we got stoned

[02:44:56.280 --> 02:44:58.660]
Yeah, he did he did

[02:45:01.980 --> 02:45:04.560]
Let's hope not okay, maybe that's what it's all about

[02:45:06.260 --> 02:45:13.080]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line on a smoking Tuesday here

[02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:16.760]
You know that mic in a mark of whatever else they was in Miami. You don't know what you're talking about sweetheart

[02:45:17.300 --> 02:45:23.900]
This show today is on fire. It's flaming light nut. Yeah, the hell's wrong with you mark

[02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:32.160]
Vading forces that is invading Iraq can describe this war you hear those runaway s's on the interpreter there and

[02:45:32.960 --> 02:45:35.560]
They hired toe to the ground. Trust me

[02:45:36.460 --> 02:45:37.300]
WQ I am

[02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:39.660]
That was a Gilbert

[02:45:40.820 --> 02:45:42.860]
There you go Clarence there's Gilbert again

[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:46.740]
Gilbert Solomon what's that facts number one more time? I got it here. Don't worry

[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:52.640]
Anybody wants to creep Gilbert who continues calling up scene phone calls on you and this radio station refuses to do anything about it

[02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:54.640]
And our program director comes in here this morning goes

[02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:56.320]
You know like that

[02:45:58.180 --> 02:46:03.460]
305 386 80 40 I want you to start writing it on rest of them walls. I want you to start getting everybody in the world to

[02:46:03.540 --> 02:46:04.700]
To creep the creep

[02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:10.460]
305 386 80 40 for the anxious Gilbert who just

[02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:16.700]
Out of control and this radio station won't do anything about it and the rumors we're hearing around a building is that certain people

[02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:20.580]
Oh, right. I don't want to mention no names have been concerning with this piece of turd

[02:46:20.580 --> 02:46:22.840]
This walking tragic missfit

[02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:26.660]
How do you like that a lot of people because he's retarded?

[02:46:26.940 --> 02:46:28.480]
I don't care. I really don't care

[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:33.880]
The fact is that what he's doing is unacceptable. Okay, no, it's this radio station. We did have balls

[02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:37.040]
He'd be the first one on the off the airless permanently, okay?

[02:46:37.860 --> 02:46:41.740]
And off the appearance list and like a banished banished for life

[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:44.940]
Wasn't that spot coming off second?

[02:46:46.180 --> 02:46:48.740]
5 6 7 0 5 come on. Let's get these phones going again

[02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:51.580]
We're smoking on this end and you people out there the same old crap

[02:46:52.780 --> 02:46:58.100]
One out of very four or five calls is the same knit which because the rest of you sitting on your haunches waiting for me to entertain you because the

[02:46:58.100 --> 02:47:02.260]
Price is right and it's for free like the weenies at the ballpark yesterday at P. P. Park

[02:47:02.260 --> 02:47:06.720]
God are you slow? Are you just an impossible you're an impossible bunch?

[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:14.920]
WQ a.m. Oh, yes, could I speak to Neil please speaking oh, oh, yeah, yes, man. Oh, hello

[02:47:15.660 --> 02:47:16.100]
I'm

[02:47:16.100 --> 02:47:20.920]
In Pompo-no, I'm Canadian I actually spoke to you about two weeks ago, right?

[02:47:22.900 --> 02:47:25.060]
You were talking earlier this morning about

[02:47:25.620 --> 02:47:28.640]
Christians and God and you know concerning the war

[02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:30.620]
Hi, I

[02:47:31.260 --> 02:47:37.780]
Have to be a Canadian Catholic I can I call myself a Canadian right because I'm not don't live in Rome

[02:47:37.780 --> 02:47:39.640]
I'm not a Rome Catholic

[02:47:40.380 --> 02:47:40.860]
but

[02:47:41.640 --> 02:47:46.200]
As far as I'm concerned God doesn't have really a role in this war

[02:47:47.060 --> 02:47:50.280]
God doesn't take in choose who he's going to

[02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:57.640]
You know stand behind is he going to be to the Israelis? Is he going to be for the Palestinians? Is he going to be American?

[02:47:58.980 --> 02:48:00.580]
I think it's fine to

[02:48:01.100 --> 02:48:07.300]
Pray for the safety of people for the Iraqis and for the Americans and you know

[02:48:07.300 --> 02:48:12.760]
I hate to say it but a lot of them don't have a prayer at this point. No true true, but I'm just saying that

[02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:17.040]
I believe in destiny and I think a lot of people

[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:24.140]
Choose their own destiny and like friends we can play that song you are my destiny by Paul Anker

[02:48:24.140 --> 02:48:25.260]
There's a good Canadian boy

[02:48:25.260 --> 02:48:33.300]
Yeah, you work there. How about your partner? No, but I lived in Detroit right across the river

[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:38.240]
In addition to which I went to school at Michigan State and of course all of them in West CKL

[02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:41.860]
W. Which used to be such a great station came in the night everywhere. How old you?

[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:46.040]
60 oh, okay, it's a matter of fact. I got something special for you

[02:48:48.460 --> 02:48:50.520]
Not every show in America could play this for you

[02:48:53.100 --> 02:48:54.400]
How do you like that?

[02:48:55.140 --> 02:48:58.600]
That's a miracle you couldn't have that happen again in a million years

[02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:04.100]
And let me ask you this question seriously because I really enjoy Toronto a lot in Canada in general

[02:49:04.100 --> 02:49:07.960]
Why is it that the religious and then they don't we have some religious nuts up there

[02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:11.980]
But the religious right as it's called in this country seems to have so much less influence

[02:49:11.980 --> 02:49:15.560]
And you don't hear that much about them and they don't bother the government very much there as opposed to here

[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:23.040]
You're saying the Canadians yeah, I can't it. You don't have that much religious fanaticism as you know you don't know true and

[02:49:25.060 --> 02:49:30.820]
Like my your natious I believe yes, I'm a Catholic and my husband is Catholic

[02:49:30.820 --> 02:49:35.660]
We have three children and one of my daughters is an atheist and so we have some

[02:49:36.600 --> 02:49:37.080]
interesting

[02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:43.640]
Discussions and you know like she says why does God let this happen? I said God doesn't let anything happen

[02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:50.240]
We were we were if you know if you are existing if you do believe in God I said we were born with a free will and

[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:56.060]
For instance if a child gets killed by a drunk driver that's not God's fault

[02:49:56.060 --> 02:49:59.360]
You know like those people yesterday that without the world on the boat

[02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:04.560]
Well, they made the wrong decision, you know, so it's or the people in that the truck in in Iraq

[02:50:05.780 --> 02:50:12.740]
Right, I mean I do think that was God's doing you know I of course not no, no, that's what I'm saying

[02:50:12.740 --> 02:50:15.660]
And you know something that people who believe that kind of thing. I mean that's really sick

[02:50:15.660 --> 02:50:20.940]
How could you believe in any kind of a powerful God who would in any way shape or form do these things?

[02:50:21.100 --> 02:50:27.660]
But on this by the same token those people for example who survived 9 11 or who survived a plane crash and then they say

[02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:33.820]
Oh, I pray to God the God heard my prayers. What about the other people? No, it's destiny is just it's you know

[02:50:33.820 --> 02:50:39.800]
That's just the way it is it's same with hurricanes tornadoes and all the rest of it that's it's nature and

[02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:44.900]
That's just the way the world is. I mean if God stepped in to stop every horrible thing happening

[02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:46.880]
Nothing would ever go wrong in the world

[02:50:46.880 --> 02:50:54.960]
But when I talk to my daughter I say okay if you don't believe in a God at least what about the forces of good and evil

[02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:59.960]
We have a lot of evil people in the world. We have a lot of good people and

[02:50:59.960 --> 02:51:03.660]
You know the the leaders that we have are making bad judgment

[02:51:04.080 --> 02:51:08.300]
Well, because that's because there are some of the evil doers in this country. Yeah, well, you know, so

[02:51:09.280 --> 02:51:14.500]
I just I can't blame God and I don't think the people should pray to God for

[02:51:14.500 --> 02:51:16.960]
Excellent. I said for the maple leaf fans. We need to pray to God

[02:51:20.820 --> 02:51:27.180]
Holy Skull see you around a okay, thank you. Bye. Bye. Oh, she just a flip when I play that CKW jingle

[02:51:29.260 --> 02:51:30.800]
Music CKW. Oh

[02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:36.560]
Let's see Uncle Nelson. I need some Mickey and Eisner the original places John and North Miami Beach

[02:51:36.560 --> 02:51:40.720]
But these people are sure all over him had a wonderful time here. I know we don't want to overdo it

[02:51:40.720 --> 02:51:42.320]
Well, which one is the original?

[02:51:43.700 --> 02:51:49.440]
Mickey calls Eisner. Yeah, well, they're all called Mickey calls. Let's well. I'll work on it during the break. Okay, I'll

[02:51:50.360 --> 02:51:53.120]
Take an attitude check and see what the ladle Anne says

[02:51:54.220 --> 02:51:56.420]
You know the Lord saved me he answered my prayers

[02:51:56.420 --> 02:51:59.760]
What about all the other people on the plane that died or the people in the car the bus or whatever?

[02:51:59.780 --> 02:52:06.240]
Well, you know, they're bunch of heathens right or he wasn't listening to them. Maybe he's maybe he's got a hearing problem. It was their time

[02:52:07.140 --> 02:52:07.500]
Oh

[02:52:08.060 --> 02:52:12.680]
I just I can't deal with it. That's why and it's not only in Canada where you don't get hardly any of that

[02:52:12.680 --> 02:52:18.800]
But any anyplace else you go. This is why people these parochial American people who never travel they don't get it

[02:52:18.800 --> 02:52:21.480]
Do you realize that only 20% of Americans have passports?

[02:52:22.760 --> 02:52:23.560]
20%

[02:52:24.800 --> 02:52:25.940]
So what do you want to do?

[02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:31.400]
In other words 80% of the people have never had a chance to travel to other countries and see what the world is really all about

[02:52:33.440 --> 02:52:36.340]
Haven to Canada and but listen, you know what I'm talking about

[02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:42.180]
That's just an Amsterdam where all the heathens are but all over Scandinavia all over Germany France Italy

[02:52:43.220 --> 02:52:48.020]
Especially Italy where you're expected to be like that. It's just the opposite. They're on to that silly old crap

[02:52:48.020 --> 02:52:52.920]
They're out of that scam. Well, they've had thousands if the Pope says far they they do it in his face, you know

[02:52:53.700 --> 02:52:57.380]
I'm telling you and does he sniff it he enjoys it

[02:53:00.660 --> 02:53:02.960]
He said wow that's a gas

[02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:10.800]
12 minutes after noon at 5.60 Q.A.M. It's a gas. All right. This whole world is a gas

[02:53:11.580 --> 02:53:12.720]
Well, there's Andrew Mitchell

[02:53:13.620 --> 02:53:16.960]
We are here who just happens to be married to Alan Greenspan by the way getting it

[02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:18.920]
They're really not sure whether or not he's alive

[02:53:18.920 --> 02:53:22.320]
There we go again as he dead or alive is it real or is it memory?

[02:53:22.500 --> 02:53:23.640]
It's every day

[02:53:24.180 --> 02:53:29.060]
Iraqi TV is showing more meetings with the Sodom and out the both sons and and well

[02:53:29.060 --> 02:53:33.640]
We're not sure if he's dead or alive. He's taped pre taped. Yeah, they pre taped it like 75 years ago

[02:53:33.640 --> 02:53:37.780]
In fact, you know something maybe all of this footage that we're seeing maybe that was pre taped

[02:53:37.780 --> 02:53:40.560]
Just like the landing on the moon. I was taking the desert

[02:53:41.120 --> 02:53:43.020]
That's not a balance see what he says

[02:53:43.640 --> 02:53:48.840]
I'll tell you what I say about losing weight do what the beast is doing and a lot of other people who are certainly doing better than he is because he's

[02:53:48.840 --> 02:53:51.820]
He's a f-off is what he is he really is he's just a puss

[02:53:51.820 --> 02:53:54.740]

Third Eisner mr. Mouse what the hell are you doing to me?

[02:55:14.320 --> 02:55:19.780]
What do you mean sir why am I reading in the paper you're gonna put a Disney theme park in Brooklyn?

[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:22.260]
Well, sir. We're just scouting locations

[02:55:22.260 --> 02:55:23.100]
Jesus

[02:55:23.100 --> 02:55:26.120]
Unscouting CEOs you are killing me

[02:55:26.120 --> 02:55:30.580]
But sir look what we've done with New York City Times Square point out I can speak

[02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:35.880]

Don't win a remus get that blue bird out of here

[02:55:40.780 --> 02:55:45.380]
Eisner, but sir look what we don't admit down man had 40 second Street is incredible

[02:55:45.380 --> 02:55:51.180]
I know what publicly I support at that, but you took all the point away. You're telling me I'm going through gavoscow

[02:55:51.180 --> 02:55:55.080]
I'm like kids. We're just scouting areas calm down

[02:55:55.080 --> 02:55:59.320]
Listen to me but much don't tell me to calm down. We got lucky with lead low in stage

[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:05.620]
128 million dollars now you're trying to ruin my whole network. What kind of programming are you running?

[02:56:06.780 --> 02:56:08.380]
Hang on a minute

[02:56:09.980 --> 02:56:10.700]
Remus

[02:56:11.540 --> 02:56:14.700]
Blue bird crap all over your shoulder

[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:18.140]
When you're so up for heaven sake

[02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:19.340]
And

[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:27.780]
God sir the network is fine. Why couldn't you come up with American Idol?

[02:56:27.780 --> 02:56:32.420]
Good God you're still running James Bob movies. They're 60 years old

[02:56:32.420 --> 02:56:38.140]
Why don't you just put steamboat willing on and be done with it? Please don't I make a couple of damn dollars?

[02:56:38.740 --> 02:56:40.800]
Well the movie division's fine

[02:56:40.800 --> 02:56:45.680]
You mentioned we were in fidget now we have the new M night shummel on movie coming out later this summer

[02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:50.320]

[02:56:52.640 --> 02:56:53.560]
Please

[02:56:56.240 --> 02:56:56.840]
Remus

[02:56:58.420 --> 02:56:59.020]
Remus

[02:57:00.560 --> 02:57:02.820]
I know you can't hear me

[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:13.380]
All right

[02:57:13.380 --> 02:57:18.740]
Yes, sir, I'd be very careful the next time I started my car. Why were you?

[02:57:18.740 --> 02:57:19.880]
What do you mean?

[02:57:20.180 --> 02:57:20.180]

[02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:24.700]
I put hand stone in your job

[02:57:24.700 --> 02:57:31.560]
But sir you're terrible. I'm sorry. Maybe I put Remus in there. I don't like it. They president of Disney Remus

[02:57:32.860 --> 02:57:34.800]
What a wonderful day

[02:57:34.800 --> 02:57:36.540]
I hear you nothing

[02:57:36.540 --> 02:57:39.860]
So 18 at 560 double-check we needed that you know that was great

[02:57:39.860 --> 02:57:41.920]
Thanks for requesting that by the way you silly person

[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:46.220]
Couple of facts is all in the Lynn Samuels emails me to check this out

[02:57:46.220 --> 02:57:49.740]
How did I miss this in the Sun sent a woman accused of having sex with boy 14 a

[02:57:50.740 --> 02:57:55.460]
32-year-old mother of three's been charged with sexual assault because of relationship she had with a 14-year-old boy

[02:57:55.460 --> 02:57:59.100]
She met while eating a church youth group in East Hartford connecticut

[02:58:00.540 --> 02:58:05.820]
Frish in the heart now five months pregnant with a child she said was spotted by the boy was charged in court

[02:58:05.820 --> 02:58:09.060]
Yesterday would second-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor

[02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:14.260]
I did not assault him the heart said yesterday after she returned to her East Hartford home after weekend and jail

[02:58:14.260 --> 02:58:17.960]
He's my very good friend. He told me he wants to marry me next year

[02:58:18.560 --> 02:58:22.340]
Ah the boy will turn 16 later this year old enough to marry with his parents consent

[02:58:22.340 --> 02:58:26.400]
But his parents were the ones who alerted authorities about the relationship late last year

[02:58:26.920 --> 02:58:32.700]
It started when the family began going to the hearts home to attend East Hartford mission a community church

[02:58:32.700 --> 02:58:34.340]
The heart said she started

[02:58:35.500 --> 02:58:40.240]
According to investigators the 14-year-old boy was in the youth group led by the heart that included overnight trips

[02:58:40.240 --> 02:58:45.360]
Her version of the boys involved in the group was that he was her assistant someone she considered a colleague

[02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:51.180]
He wasn't my student. She insisted he was her colleague kind of like Adam Kirschner was Brian Andrew's colleague

[02:58:51.180 --> 02:58:55.120]
He wished at iod. Yeah, he was trying real hard little Brian Andrews

[02:58:55.780 --> 02:58:57.360]
Tippy-toe on his way through the tulips

[02:58:57.960 --> 02:59:02.180]
Court documents detailed a November sexual encounter in her home at 49 Millbrook drive

[02:59:02.180 --> 02:59:07.080]
She said she was distraught over the death of her brother in Jamaica and the boy by then 15 had come over to visit

[02:59:08.340 --> 02:59:12.280]
He was comforting me the heart said it wasn't unnatural for him to reach out to me like that

[02:59:12.280 --> 02:59:18.220]
But the relationship began before then shortly before his 15th birthday corner polis the heart took him to Florida with her in East Hartford police

[02:59:18.220 --> 02:59:19.460]
And she had sex with him there

[02:59:20.420 --> 02:59:24.180]
His parents in Bloomfield didn't know he'd gone with her until he was reported missing from high school

[02:59:24.180 --> 02:59:29.520]
Which he began attending a month before his parents called Bloomfield police and investigation was begun and on and on a coast

[02:59:31.680 --> 02:59:35.300]
The heart says she hasn't broken the law wasn't a crime. She explained that a romance

[02:59:35.300 --> 02:59:41.500]
It's more like Romeo and Juliet. She said two people who can't be together because of how of house society views them

[02:59:42.020 --> 02:59:45.920]
Yeah, I was like Pat smart don't it sure does Pam smart whatever her name was

[02:59:46.640 --> 02:59:47.960]
Pam not so smart

[02:59:50.240 --> 02:59:53.560]
Here's a fact from John boat George in Miami Beach who says

[02:59:54.120 --> 02:59:59.800]
My mother escaped from a train to Siberia when she was 14 years old my father was given a small bag of coins and escaped

[02:59:59.800 --> 03:00:02.320]
Pull into Switzerland on Christmas night

[03:00:02.320 --> 03:00:05.520]
1939 when he was 15 he escaped on skis

[03:00:06.280 --> 03:00:10.060]
You'll find no one who supports a strong defense and respects the great sacrifices of our

[03:00:10.060 --> 03:00:16.000]
Professional military more than I do our first obligation of those troops is not to commit them to a conflict without solutions

[03:00:16.700 --> 03:00:22.060]
What happened the exit strategy that Colin Powell defined as a key in any war plan if we do go to war

[03:00:22.060 --> 03:00:26.260]
It's our obligation to occupy and defend the civilian population under the Geneva Accords

[03:00:26.920 --> 03:00:31.520]
Clearly we needed at least as many troops as the previous were impossibly more to be an army of occupation

[03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:35.460]
The Israelis have made bombing snipers in general to send a part of their lives

[03:00:35.460 --> 03:00:39.620]
Get ready America because what we are doing is heading diving headlong into an abyss

[03:00:39.620 --> 03:00:42.480]
Creating even greater terrorist threats and we already have

[03:00:43.840 --> 03:00:48.900]
Shock and all falls into the same categories letting the Chinese deal some of our most sensitive technology

[03:00:48.900 --> 03:00:50.560]
And not just during the plane moments after landing

[03:00:50.560 --> 03:00:56.020]
It flows with the decision to allow friendly ballistic missiles to be delivered to Yemen from a North Korean power chip

[03:00:56.020 --> 03:00:58.860]
We should have sank the ship and blamed it on Iraqi mines

[03:00:58.860 --> 03:01:03.740]
Maybe the administration is keeping the missiles as an insurance a case. They don't find any WMDs in Iraq

[03:01:05.140 --> 03:01:11.680]
I grew up in Missouri and they chose a dead man over Ashcroff for the Senate now this holy roller is covered statues of justice with dresses

[03:01:11.680 --> 03:01:14.300]
Because he's offended by seeing nipples on statues

[03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:17.300]
This is the chief law enforcement officer of the U.S

[03:01:17.300 --> 03:01:19.260]
Certainly, he's got more important things to do

[03:01:20.340 --> 03:01:26.880]
So now we get to watch Tom Rid speaking with that spooky 30 foot image of Misi rains over the most powerful civilian organization in the world

[03:01:26.880 --> 03:01:29.760]
Secret courts detention without legal representation

[03:01:29.760 --> 03:01:34.660]
What scares me is that we must also sacrifice our constitutional rights to question the need for war

[03:01:35.200 --> 03:01:37.040]
It is the duty of the Congress to declare war

[03:01:37.040 --> 03:01:42.940]
They circumvented the issue by issuing a blank check to conduct war preemptively just like Hitler's invasion of Czechoslovakia

[03:01:42.940 --> 03:01:49.880]
So now we find an unseen enemy in a secret war sounds like George or well the Misi's John Boat George and Miami Beach keep up the good work Neil

[03:01:49.880 --> 03:01:50.480]
like that

[03:01:53.540 --> 03:01:59.140]
If the people out there could just separate in their minds we support the troops all of us

[03:01:59.140 --> 03:02:04.040]
Do we support the war and I'll tell you one exception that asshole professor a kilometer

[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:09.620]
Do you read about him? No, you didn't read about that was one the right? No that idiot who said that he wished that

[03:02:10.260 --> 03:02:16.360]
The citizens more troops would die and it would just you know that this is what we should have happen in order to

[03:02:16.780 --> 03:02:18.520]
Show the people of our way. Oh

[03:02:19.780 --> 03:02:20.660]
Lunatic although

[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:25.520]
Although he must not be the only one has that in mind

[03:02:26.560 --> 03:02:28.420]
Reuters in the Washington Post today

[03:02:29.840 --> 03:02:30.280]
Yesterday

[03:02:31.060 --> 03:02:35.340]
The U.S. is prepared to pay a very high price in terms of casualties to capture bag

[03:02:35.340 --> 03:02:38.760]
Then an aust Saddam Hussein a senior official the U.S. Central Command said yesterday

[03:02:38.760 --> 03:02:44.520]
We're prepared to pay a very high price because we're not going to do anything other than ensure that this regime goes away

[03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:49.840]
The official told reporters adding that U.S. casualties in the 12th they old war so far had been fairly light

[03:02:51.620 --> 03:02:55.960]
Fairly light all the news of those that mean they've been lightly killed also fairly light

[03:02:56.500 --> 03:02:59.520]
If that means there'll be a lot of casualties then there will be a lot of casualties

[03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:04.320]
And the official is spoke on condition that he not be named you want me to read that sentence against and talk was just banging you

[03:03:04.320 --> 03:03:08.360]
If that means that there'll be a lot of casualties then there will be a lot of casualties you said

[03:03:09.520 --> 03:03:14.740]
Referring on that referring tonight's in WW2 when we lose a thousand people he added there will come a time

[03:03:14.740 --> 03:03:16.560]
Maybe when things are going to be much more shocking

[03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:22.200]
The official addressing reports at the central commands forward headquarters and gutters said the net

[03:03:22.200 --> 03:03:27.500]
Result of reporting by correspondence with the invasion force with creating a false impression of constant for OSHA's battle

[03:03:28.060 --> 03:03:31.580]
Such reports he said created the impression of a much more difficult campaign than it was

[03:03:31.580 --> 03:03:36.980]
That's not what's going on out there he added its military action at places primarily of our time in choosing

[03:03:39.580 --> 03:03:41.100]
But once again

[03:03:42.480 --> 03:03:47.440]
If it means there will be a lot of casualties then there will be a lot of casualties he said

[03:03:48.040 --> 03:03:52.820]
And how many members of the administration have children out there oh the big O

[03:03:55.420 --> 03:03:59.720]

We have open lines doing screenless, huh? And then embarrassing

[03:04:25.980 --> 03:04:29.100]
Typical typical and embarrassing humiliating degrading

[03:04:30.220 --> 03:04:34.680]
Degrading what this town gives back not just to me but to anybody that's why this town's in the shape that it's in

Bum about all this other bull crap

[03:04:41.920 --> 03:04:47.880]
People are manipulated as easily as a bunch of sheep like the flamingos at higherly when they start blowing a whistle. They still do that

[03:04:48.460 --> 03:04:51.700]
I don't know well when it's feeding time they do I say

We'll make it in your...

[03:08:18.500 --> 03:08:21.140]
You might mention my name to Wright's Master Gary.

[03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:27.360]
Okay.

[03:08:32.360 --> 03:08:33.660]
Not great.

[03:09:05.500 --> 03:09:08.540]
You always stand not stuck with the crack of everyone.

[03:09:21.760 --> 03:09:23.440]
At 7 o'clock tonight with Jugs and Randy.

[03:09:24.300 --> 03:09:27.520]
After the hockey game, you got the 80k show, gambling GA or 80k.

[03:09:28.140 --> 03:09:28.980]
And 10th, what is it?

[03:09:29.240 --> 03:09:30.440]
2-6 in the morning, Joanne Marks.

[03:09:30.440 --> 03:09:33.440]
So you were about to tell me earlier when I just took that long breakfast part.

[03:09:33.440 --> 03:09:40.440]
You were, I heard, was that they were again the war before the war, but now that it started, they're all...

[03:09:41.260 --> 03:09:41.620]
Dunghho.

[03:09:41.680 --> 03:09:42.060]
Why is that?

[03:09:42.120 --> 03:09:43.060]
It's the rumor that I heard that.

[03:09:43.800 --> 03:09:44.380]
So not that it's a joke.

[03:09:44.380 --> 03:09:48.500]
It didn't make any sense before it started and it was unacceptable and there was no justification for it.

[03:09:48.820 --> 03:09:52.100]
Once it started, we might as well sell out as the term that comes to mind.

[03:09:52.100 --> 03:09:53.500]
And sell out. When did that sell out?

[03:09:53.500 --> 03:09:54.260]
I haven't heard that from them.

[03:09:54.400 --> 03:09:55.480]
You know something, let me say it again.

[03:09:55.660 --> 03:10:00.700]
I have never in my life seen such a country of weak sisters, of lemmings of people.

[03:10:00.800 --> 03:10:03.000]
And I'm so embarrassed for the people in this business.

[03:10:03.100 --> 03:10:05.160]
Of course I'm always embarrassed, but more so than usual.

[03:10:05.460 --> 03:10:07.360]
For the people in the so-called broadcasting business.

[03:10:08.340 --> 03:10:11.680]
That everybody immediately has to cave in and go step into line.

[03:10:11.680 --> 03:10:13.460]
It's just pathetic, tragic.

[03:10:13.620 --> 03:10:16.200]
Now here's a fact that says, from Kenneth from Orlando.

[03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:17.620]
Hi, Neil and George.

[03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:21.040]
I'm factoring you from Orlando. I moved here last year and I love it hardly any Cubans.

[03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:22.060]
George, yeah.

[03:10:22.480 --> 03:10:25.500]
The only thing I miss about mine is you show the AM stations here are crap.

[03:10:25.680 --> 03:10:26.900]
They're all run by a cheap channel.

[03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:29.020]
But I do deliveries at Clear Channel.

[03:10:29.180 --> 03:10:32.840]
One time I mentioned your name and lady told me to shut up because the boss doesn't like you.

[03:10:33.580 --> 03:10:34.200]
No Schmidt.

[03:10:35.580 --> 03:10:37.800]
In fact, that's what we're proud of on this station. No Schmidt.

[03:10:38.540 --> 03:10:40.080]
We got balls and we got no Schmidt.

[03:10:42.980 --> 03:10:44.780]
That's just pouring in here today.

[03:10:44.900 --> 03:10:46.660]
Here's one from Tony who says,

[03:10:48.360 --> 03:10:49.620]
that's Tony as in a she.

[03:10:50.480 --> 03:10:52.600]
We just wanted to thank you again for this weekend.

[03:10:52.800 --> 03:10:55.300]
Oh, look at who this is. This is from our winners of that contest.

[03:10:55.880 --> 03:10:57.240]
Oh, I had in her back from then.

[03:10:57.500 --> 03:10:58.440]
Felipe and the Tony.

[03:10:58.920 --> 03:11:01.680]
See? We want to thank you again for this weekend, Neil and George.

[03:11:02.160 --> 03:11:04.480]
We had an awesome time. It was crazy as you can imagine.

[03:11:04.480 --> 03:11:08.540]
It was actually a couple of their Jim and Liz who are loyal listeners and recognize this from the pictures on the website.

[03:11:08.960 --> 03:11:11.460]
I'm sorry we didn't get back to you sooner, but we need a little time to recover.

[03:11:11.700 --> 03:11:11.840]
I bet.

[03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:15.280]
I tried to get out of work early Thursday to go see George at the hotel but wasn't able to.

[03:11:15.620 --> 03:11:18.880]
I guess we'll just have to take a trip to Treasure Island next time you there so she can meet you.

[03:11:18.880 --> 03:11:22.140]
She says, you guys are great. My husband loves your show. Thanks Tony and Felipe.

[03:11:22.380 --> 03:11:24.340]
You guys are fine in more ways than one.

[03:11:24.560 --> 03:11:28.300]
Yeah, it was while Troy went back over the weekend and said that what I saw,

[03:11:28.480 --> 03:11:31.080]
what we saw during the appearance was nothing.

[03:11:32.520 --> 03:11:33.240]
Was nothingness.

[03:11:33.820 --> 03:11:34.680]
What do you mean by that?

[03:11:35.420 --> 03:11:39.140]
In other words, it was it was happening Thursday when we went down for the appearance.

[03:11:39.180 --> 03:11:40.360]
But it was happening like time spent.

[03:11:40.640 --> 03:11:41.600]
Yeah, yeah.

[03:11:41.800 --> 03:11:42.560]
Have you liked that?

[03:11:42.680 --> 03:11:43.600]
So what were we looking for?

[03:11:44.040 --> 03:11:46.060]
No, I was looking to make sure he took those things out of it.

[03:11:46.060 --> 03:11:46.740]
Oh, yeah, try.

[03:11:46.740 --> 03:11:48.920]
Yeah, because I don't want him to be the next PD Lenny.

[03:11:48.940 --> 03:11:49.200]
Okay.

[03:11:49.720 --> 03:11:55.060]
No, I don't want to have wild diarrhea the rest of the day. I'm planning on spending the day in enjoying the last of the afternoon.

[03:11:55.380 --> 03:11:58.260]
I don't want to have like wild diarrhea for the sake of the sale department.

[03:11:58.260 --> 03:11:59.660]
Like I always have over again.

[03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:00.980]
No, thank you in the bathroom.

[03:12:01.040 --> 03:12:02.520]
No, and I don't have any bottle corks.

[03:12:04.500 --> 03:12:05.040]
556 votes.

[03:12:05.080 --> 03:12:07.660]
How does religion permit that we haven't had one call yet?

[03:12:08.380 --> 03:12:11.020]
As usual, and you want to know why because you can't explain it.

[03:12:11.120 --> 03:12:12.780]
And there is no justification for it.

[03:12:12.980 --> 03:12:15.400]
All you members of the God Squad who listen to the show.

[03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:18.580]
You know how many members of the God Squad listen to the show?

[03:12:18.600 --> 03:12:19.480]
Fuck third man.

[03:12:19.640 --> 03:12:20.220]
Well, there you go.

[03:12:20.320 --> 03:12:22.500]
I haven't heard from any of them.

[03:12:22.700 --> 03:12:25.120]
How does religion permit the carnage of the war in Iraq?

[03:12:25.280 --> 03:12:27.360]
And again, keep in mind, this isn't self defense.

[03:12:27.500 --> 03:12:28.620]
We weren't attacked by them.

[03:12:28.960 --> 03:12:32.320]
Oh, I have no problem with the what we didn't have.

[03:12:32.380 --> 03:12:34.280]
Afghanistan, all the as usual, we didn't finish up.

[03:12:34.340 --> 03:12:34.640]
Yeah.

[03:12:34.960 --> 03:12:37.960]
And we left them hanging, but but nevertheless, I mean, that was justified.

[03:12:38.100 --> 03:12:39.320]
The Taliban, they attacked us.

[03:12:39.320 --> 03:12:39.920]
We hit them.

[03:12:39.920 --> 03:12:41.160]
You know, like it says in the Godfather.

[03:12:41.300 --> 03:12:41.540]
Exactly.

[03:12:41.540 --> 03:12:42.640]
We were not attacked.

[03:12:42.780 --> 03:12:44.300]
We were not on the endanger of being attacked.

[03:12:44.420 --> 03:12:47.500]
They represented no tangible threat or provable threat to us.

[03:12:47.500 --> 03:12:50.020]
The Brits or anybody else are the Aussies down under.

[03:12:50.400 --> 03:12:53.840]
But nothings that he might have to somebody that might have been dead.

[03:12:53.840 --> 03:12:55.580]
So, that in mind, this isn't we attack them.

[03:12:56.480 --> 03:12:58.680]
And like I said yesterday in Jimmy Brezzlin and that,

[03:12:59.460 --> 03:13:01.360]
I still can't get over that column, you know.

[03:13:01.620 --> 03:13:04.060]
I read it twice and maybe it just struck me.

[03:13:04.700 --> 03:13:06.680]
But you can't wash away the blood on a hand.

[03:13:06.740 --> 03:13:07.100]
They don't care.

[03:13:07.580 --> 03:13:08.460]
Well, I do.

[03:13:08.820 --> 03:13:09.860]
Okay, I don't care if they care.

[03:13:10.100 --> 03:13:10.440]
I do.

[03:13:11.020 --> 03:13:12.420]
Because it's very obvious.

[03:13:12.600 --> 03:13:13.600]
The blood is on their hands.

[03:13:13.620 --> 03:13:15.160]
The blood of all of the people.

[03:13:15.640 --> 03:13:16.800]
Because there isn't a white star.

[03:13:17.120 --> 03:13:22.140]
There isn't anybody dying there now or starving or lacking for medication for their children.

[03:13:22.480 --> 03:13:25.520]
There isn't anybody there inhaling that as medical,

[03:13:25.780 --> 03:13:29.800]
that lead in polluted air that isn't responsible for this attack,

[03:13:29.960 --> 03:13:34.500]
which is exactly shock and all my fat ass money wipes the blood off.

[03:13:35.280 --> 03:13:38.860]
Religious fanaticism is that through to the problems say 291 people.

[03:13:39.500 --> 03:13:42.120]
God doesn't carry his busy with ball games 101.

[03:13:43.620 --> 03:13:45.540]
Even the Lord loves Nearogers 77.

[03:13:46.620 --> 03:13:49.220]
It doesn't attend commandments say that I shall not kill 45.

[03:13:49.860 --> 03:13:53.160]
It's self-defense so God will allow it 26.

[03:13:53.700 --> 03:13:55.740]
And God wants us to kill our enemies 15.

[03:13:56.080 --> 03:13:56.560]
Kill our enemies.

[03:13:56.980 --> 03:13:57.760]
There you go.

[03:13:59.780 --> 03:14:02.460]
Oh, and here's a, before I get back to your tremendous call,

[03:14:02.560 --> 03:14:03.660]
it has been okay today, you know.

[03:14:03.700 --> 03:14:04.260]
It's all right.

[03:14:04.500 --> 03:14:05.640]
And yesterday, how do you like that?

[03:14:05.820 --> 03:14:05.900]
Huh.

[03:14:07.140 --> 03:14:09.520]
Joseph and Lee Hayaker, somebody fasted this to me.

[03:14:10.020 --> 03:14:12.360]
Letter the editor in the Fort Myers news press.

[03:14:14.020 --> 03:14:16.120]
Be positive about war rights, Joseph.

[03:14:17.200 --> 03:14:19.380]
President Bush has started this war and will finish it,

[03:14:19.420 --> 03:14:21.000]
and all the protest will not change this.

[03:14:21.700 --> 03:14:24.300]
If you are truly against this war, then take positive action.

[03:14:24.820 --> 03:14:27.980]
If it's about the oil, give up your automobile and your electricity and make a difference.

[03:14:28.720 --> 03:14:31.680]
If it's about the innocent lives, go to a rack and volunteer medical help.

[03:14:31.920 --> 03:14:34.640]
If you can't go, send food, medical supplies, and money,

[03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:36.220]
although I believe the United States is doing that.

[03:14:36.420 --> 03:14:37.760]
So Joseph, I guess, is in favor of the war.

[03:14:37.880 --> 03:14:38.960]
Why he's not over there fighting it?

[03:14:40.080 --> 03:14:41.720]
Isn't that logical, according to the...

[03:14:41.720 --> 03:14:41.920]
Of course.

[03:14:42.340 --> 03:14:47.220]
He says, if we're such a terrible nation, boycott us and immigrate to the nation, we should emulate.

[03:14:47.720 --> 03:14:50.100]
Lastly, for those who are asking, what would Jesus do?

[03:14:50.420 --> 03:14:52.740]
I believe that you're forgetting that Jesus is not the man.

[03:14:53.240 --> 03:14:53.940]
God is the man.

[03:14:54.300 --> 03:14:57.100]
Jesus is the son through whom we get to God.

[03:14:57.460 --> 03:15:00.380]
So the question should be, what would God do or want or respect?

[03:15:00.800 --> 03:15:03.180]
I believe if you read your Bible perhaps to find another answer,

[03:15:03.180 --> 03:15:06.460]
one that does not sit well with your show them love and peace theory.

[03:15:06.940 --> 03:15:09.380]
God bless all of us and thank you to the men and women.

[03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:12.680]
And yes, the boys and girls who are still children, who were the uniforms of our nation,

[03:15:12.920 --> 03:15:14.080]
says Joseph and the High Acres.

[03:15:15.220 --> 03:15:16.300]
God's got another answer.

[03:15:16.680 --> 03:15:17.560]
Right. Read the Old Testament.

[03:15:17.760 --> 03:15:19.020]
The father of the son and the Holy Ghost.

[03:15:19.100 --> 03:15:19.400]
The Trinity.

[03:15:19.820 --> 03:15:20.940]
See, I hate to break the news to you.

[03:15:21.040 --> 03:15:24.040]
But even an old atheist like me knows that there is no difference, okay?

[03:15:24.560 --> 03:15:25.360]
There is no difference.

[03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:26.340]
They're all the same animal.

[03:15:27.300 --> 03:15:29.580]
The father of the son and the Holy Moly Ghost.

[03:15:30.200 --> 03:15:30.560]
Okay.

[03:15:31.400 --> 03:15:32.540]
Browns would pass the toast.

[03:15:32.680 --> 03:15:33.620]
Well, the wafer will do.

[03:15:35.320 --> 03:15:36.040]
Bloody waifers.

[03:15:36.900 --> 03:15:39.640]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60.

[03:15:39.780 --> 03:15:40.780]
Maybe they were neco waifers.

[03:15:40.820 --> 03:15:41.980]
I do like neco waifers, don't you?

[03:15:42.660 --> 03:15:43.000]
They're okay.

[03:15:43.400 --> 03:15:44.020]
Where do you get those, Canada?

[03:15:45.460 --> 03:15:46.240]
W-Q-I-M.

[03:15:46.660 --> 03:15:48.060]
This is former...

[03:15:48.060 --> 03:15:49.740]
Yeah, this is former human being.

[03:15:50.900 --> 03:15:53.400]
God, Almighty, do you think they're practicing their material or what?

[03:15:53.840 --> 03:15:54.120]
Not enough.

[03:15:55.320 --> 03:15:56.140]
W-Q-I-M.

[03:16:00.560 --> 03:16:01.200]
Sounds like Enrique.

[03:16:02.200 --> 03:16:03.140]
W-Q-I-M.

[03:16:03.360 --> 03:16:05.680]
Why don't you go back to Iraq, U-I-R-E-Factor?

[03:16:05.820 --> 03:16:05.980]
Woody.

[03:16:06.340 --> 03:16:06.760]
Yeah, it's Woody.

[03:16:07.220 --> 03:16:08.080]
Trying to be acute.

[03:16:08.240 --> 03:16:08.940]
W-Q-I-M.

[03:16:09.180 --> 03:16:11.920]
The end of God's so great was Blue Ball's hurt so bad.

[03:16:12.140 --> 03:16:12.840]
That's a good point.

[03:16:13.100 --> 03:16:13.200]
Huh?

[03:16:13.760 --> 03:16:14.340]
That's a good point.

[03:16:15.240 --> 03:16:17.980]
If God is so great, and of course this guy sounds like a voice of experience.

[03:16:24.700 --> 03:16:25.720]
Yes.

[03:16:26.340 --> 03:16:29.980]
I'm so horny for you.

[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:31.120]
Huh?

[03:16:31.560 --> 03:16:36.140]
Will you stop pricking and me?

[03:16:36.920 --> 03:16:38.480]
You want me, don't you?

[03:16:47.740 --> 03:16:51.360]
I'm so horny for you.

[03:16:51.520 --> 03:16:52.020]
See, there you go.

[03:16:52.080 --> 03:16:53.000]
I feel right in, didn't it?

[03:16:53.160 --> 03:16:53.840]
So to speak.

[03:16:56.120 --> 03:16:56.960]
56670560, Pompah.

[03:16:56.960 --> 03:16:58.100]
We got a bit for everything, man.

[03:16:59.240 --> 03:17:00.980]
As a matter of fact, when Duff came in and said,

[03:17:02.460 --> 03:17:03.440]
W-Q-I-M.

[03:17:04.960 --> 03:17:05.760]
Q-I-M, hello.

[03:17:06.220 --> 03:17:07.220]
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not going in.

[03:17:07.640 --> 03:17:08.160]
Oh, ha.

[03:17:11.420 --> 03:17:13.300]
That was the best call of the century, here.

[03:17:13.840 --> 03:17:14.940]
Yeah, likely story, honey.

[03:17:16.060 --> 03:17:16.960]
W-Q-I-M.

[03:17:17.140 --> 03:17:18.020]
Hey, Neil, what's going on?

[03:17:18.020 --> 03:17:18.340]
How you doing?

[03:17:18.600 --> 03:17:19.360]
Thank God, man.

[03:17:19.500 --> 03:17:21.240]
I can't stand so far.

[03:17:21.780 --> 03:17:23.520]
I used to live in California and move back here.

[03:17:23.520 --> 03:17:24.040]
Oh, that night.

[03:17:24.180 --> 03:17:25.820]
Listen, anybody lives in California comes here.

[03:17:25.860 --> 03:17:26.700]
A bad mistake.

[03:17:26.920 --> 03:17:27.280]
Bad move.

[03:17:27.480 --> 03:17:30.600]
Well, I used to live here when I was out there to do the music thing and came back.

[03:17:30.900 --> 03:17:33.740]
And I tell you, man, if it wasn't for you, I would pull it,

[03:17:33.780 --> 03:17:35.500]
I slept in my hair out, which I don't have much left.

[03:17:35.500 --> 03:17:36.920]
Yeah, me too, I'm pulling it right now.

[03:17:37.600 --> 03:17:39.360]
One thing, Doug, can we get up to say,

[03:17:39.440 --> 03:17:41.000]
Rack thing is just getting old.

[03:17:41.820 --> 03:17:42.420]
Meaning what?

[03:17:42.780 --> 03:17:47.240]
Man, it's just like, I know that you're up on it, you're against it.

[03:17:47.240 --> 03:17:48.060]
So let me ask you this.

[03:17:48.180 --> 03:17:50.640]
Have we talked about a multitude of things on this show here today?

[03:17:50.920 --> 03:17:51.320]
That's true.

[03:17:51.620 --> 03:17:52.980]
Are we dwelling on the war?

[03:17:53.120 --> 03:17:53.480]
Are we dwelling?

[03:17:53.540 --> 03:17:54.080]
Am I putting on it?

[03:17:54.080 --> 03:17:54.320]
You later.

[03:17:54.740 --> 03:17:55.000]
With more.

[03:17:55.120 --> 03:17:55.680]
All of that stuff?

[03:17:55.820 --> 03:17:56.420]
I don't think so.

[03:17:56.540 --> 03:18:00.080]
Can I dwelling just a tad, but I mean, I'd like to hear about your love life and who your days are.

[03:18:00.100 --> 03:18:01.480]
No, that guy, that idiot again.

[03:18:01.720 --> 03:18:02.840]
Oh, Jesus.

[03:18:02.840 --> 03:18:03.960]
How sad.

[03:18:04.940 --> 03:18:07.000]
How very, very sad.

[03:18:07.320 --> 03:18:08.120]
How tragic.

[03:18:08.380 --> 03:18:09.620]
Oh, my God.

[03:18:10.080 --> 03:18:12.620]
Oh, please, please free us from these people.

[03:18:14.100 --> 03:18:17.360]
We're going to declare the Emancipation Proclamation right here on QAIM.

[03:18:17.980 --> 03:18:19.360]
I'm guaranteeing one thing, sir.

[03:18:19.480 --> 03:18:20.080]
It's showing you.

[03:18:20.840 --> 03:18:22.420]
That's for God, damn sure.

[03:18:22.860 --> 03:18:23.500]
As in...

[03:18:23.500 --> 03:18:24.220]
Oh, God.

[03:18:24.420 --> 03:18:24.840]
Damn sure.

[03:18:26.460 --> 03:18:29.080]
20 to 1 at 560, WQAIM.

[03:18:29.200 --> 03:18:29.460]
What?

[03:18:29.740 --> 03:18:31.140]
If you can't be funny, at least be versatile.

[03:18:31.140 --> 03:18:31.980]
Yeah, that's right.

[03:18:33.060 --> 03:18:33.460]
Pathetic.

[03:18:34.160 --> 03:18:34.560]
Sad.

[03:18:35.200 --> 03:18:36.000]
You're tragic.

[03:18:37.120 --> 03:18:39.500]
Probably, uh, probably a year kicked his ass out of California.

[03:18:39.920 --> 03:18:40.740]
Probably got deported.

[03:18:41.440 --> 03:18:44.940]
You know, over a million people are about to mattress over the phone from our friends at Dalai Matris, including us.

[03:18:45.300 --> 03:18:46.440]
And hundreds more are doing it every week.

[03:18:46.640 --> 03:18:50.520]
So obviously, it's not like really a dangerous thing to like make a big investment over the phone.

[03:18:50.660 --> 03:18:52.840]
Because Dalai Matris are people you can trust.

[03:18:53.140 --> 03:18:54.600]
I've been talking about them for years.

[03:18:54.620 --> 03:18:58.980]
And through personal experience, I guarantee you, there is no better, no smarter, no more inexpensive way.

[03:18:58.980 --> 03:19:01.800]
They get you a great name brand, Matris, than making that one easy call.

[03:19:02.160 --> 03:19:03.040]
1-800-MATRIS.

[03:19:03.520 --> 03:19:05.400]
1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S.

[03:19:05.560 --> 03:19:07.760]
If you call them right now, they can be there knocking on your door by tonight.

[03:19:08.240 --> 03:19:08.800]
Take it from me.

[03:19:08.860 --> 03:19:10.240]
I've called them like I said in the Zendian Times.

[03:19:10.380 --> 03:19:14.020]
They carry C-Lease, Sura, Simmons, King Coil, Air V-Size, Air V-Style.

[03:19:14.280 --> 03:19:15.240]
And you don't have to be disappointed.

[03:19:15.360 --> 03:19:18.580]
No matter which one you want, and whatever size, they got it ready for an early immediate delivery.

[03:19:18.760 --> 03:19:19.300]
They're ready for you.

[03:19:19.640 --> 03:19:22.980]
Once you buy a Matris from Dalai Matris, you'll never go back to the show or misslepping again.

[03:19:23.260 --> 03:19:25.560]
You'll never waste your time and money in those betting and department stores.

[03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:30.280]
And don't forget when you buy your Matris from Dalai Matris, they set up the new and take away the crappy old smelly betting for free.

[03:19:30.520 --> 03:19:37.840]
I'll say it again, very unusual, but along with other other great service, Dalai Matris takes away the smelly, sour little betting and such up your great brand new and for you for free.

[03:19:38.140 --> 03:19:42.360]
So make the call now and guarantee yourself months and years of great sleep night after night.

[03:19:42.540 --> 03:19:45.380]
Call 1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S.

[03:19:45.660 --> 03:19:48.400]
And then you can talk to that last guy about his love life and all the people he's doing.

[03:19:48.800 --> 03:19:55.100]
Wishes. 1-800-MATRIS for Dalai Matris, the easiest, the smartest possible way to get you a great new name brand bid.

[03:19:55.560 --> 03:20:00.800]
Live and local. Here's Sports Radio 560, healing to you, eh?

[03:20:01.280 --> 03:20:01.280]

[03:20:02.640 --> 03:20:08.260]
The Book of Rides just came in and of course, you know, I got a stall for a second or two until this thing queues up.

[03:20:09.020 --> 03:20:11.060]
But don't you understand? I mean, these short breaks are a killer.

[03:20:11.460 --> 03:20:17.760]
A tower bitch on the radio, who found a niche with no life as holes,

[03:20:17.760 --> 03:20:25.420]
shuddened women, red necks and stands, and fed as frauds in cellulite pants.

[03:20:26.060 --> 03:20:32.880]
The constipation has been tougher phased, what the so-tallant knows a better way.

[03:20:33.460 --> 03:20:40.480]
Cell fading cataly, or the docks you, but she knows what is best for you.

[03:20:40.480 --> 03:20:48.480]
Dr. Laura, oh f*** her, she cast a spell for her.

[03:20:49.040 --> 03:21:00.480]
She's dispensing, sound advice, two morons with the brains of my beast.

[03:21:01.460 --> 03:21:08.840]
A Dr. Laura, by the way, has your mother feeling today?

[03:21:09.640 --> 03:21:16.840]
Laura, I would strongly advise to put your tongue in my brown eyes.

[03:21:17.660 --> 03:21:23.740]
Dr. Laura, oh f*** her, he sets the ice just in cover.

[03:21:25.140 --> 03:21:35.740]
The smell of Probelochise, oozing from her bony eyes.

[03:21:37.700 --> 03:21:42.000]
Look at a mad dog, I'll redden the face and emberst, I understand you gotta cover your eyes.

[03:21:42.480 --> 03:21:47.740]
I understand that he said I am a pussy and I'm proud of, but at least you admit it, you're honest about it, right?

[03:21:48.580 --> 03:21:51.840]
I'm feeling great, I've never had a bonding moment with mold this morning.

[03:21:51.840 --> 03:21:52.740]
Excuse me?

[03:21:52.920 --> 03:21:58.120]
A little bit of a bonding moment or two with mold this morning, we actually spoke, we waved at each other from a brief distance.

[03:21:58.860 --> 03:22:01.940]
No, no, had a little bit of a speaking thing in there.

[03:22:03.320 --> 03:22:06.180]
We spoke a little, yeah, a little number.

[03:22:08.840 --> 03:22:12.800]
Thank you so much, go on here and rip by Eddie Jones and ask, come on, he can handle it.

[03:22:13.440 --> 03:22:18.000]
Say no sir, I heard what you said yesterday, it is still in, but that's the point, that's the point.

[03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:24.060]
So we're not talking about the U of M and Donna Shalaley, we're talking about Eddie Jones and Amacho Dolphins with you and your Super Bowl ring,

[03:22:24.360 --> 03:22:29.120]
the Amacho players who take showers together and they're worried about we got balls and like I said yesterday,

[03:22:29.260 --> 03:22:32.000]
maybe that's why they choke in December or maybe they don't have any balls.

[03:22:32.300 --> 03:22:35.320]
I think you guys are a examine that, of course, Joe Rose already has.

[03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:36.960]
I am a pussy.

[03:22:37.300 --> 03:22:37.820]
Yeah, okay.

[03:22:38.060 --> 03:22:41.460]
Jim Maddys' is, I am a pussy, at least he admits it, let's hear it from the mad dog.

[03:22:43.060 --> 03:22:44.600]
Honestly, he counts for a lot of new show.

[03:22:45.180 --> 03:22:46.820]
He didn't hear what he called you when he came in here.

[03:22:47.240 --> 03:22:50.800]
He said it to me, he's not a backstabber, he said it right to my face.

[03:22:51.160 --> 03:22:52.040]
We already knew that.

[03:22:52.340 --> 03:22:54.440]
He said that I'm a fuck sucker, okay?

[03:22:55.120 --> 03:22:56.460]
What's the big news with that?

[03:22:58.120 --> 03:23:01.160]
So he's all whipped up into a frenzy, mad dog will be along between one and three.

[03:23:01.280 --> 03:23:05.200]
He wants to save his job, he doesn't want to get in trouble with the Dolphin organization, doesn't want to get Kandas,

[03:23:05.280 --> 03:23:12.460]
doesn't want to piss off Eddie Jones, doesn't want to piss off Pizz off Dave Onestat, doesn't want to piss off J. Feeler, all of these people.

[03:23:13.700 --> 03:23:15.440]
Like I said, at least he admits it, okay?

[03:23:15.560 --> 03:23:19.700]
He's not trying to defend the indefensible, he realizes it's silly, it's juvenile.

[03:23:20.560 --> 03:23:26.420]
Eddie Jones should be ashamed and embarrassed over this thing with we got balls with billboards, with wacky jacky Thompson get these people crazy.

[03:23:26.740 --> 03:23:31.420]
I mean, just when you consider the source, that alone should tell them just to cut the crap.

[03:23:31.900 --> 03:23:33.220]
Just consider the source, Eddie.

[03:23:33.940 --> 03:23:34.600]
You silly goose.

[03:23:36.300 --> 03:23:39.060]
I mean, and you know what should really be the proof of the pudding?

[03:23:39.380 --> 03:23:42.840]
When Greg Reed has got the balls to stand up to this, what does that tell you, huh?

[03:23:43.820 --> 03:23:49.460]
A man who makes beabies look like water balloons, with what he's got hanging.

[03:23:50.120 --> 03:23:53.340]
And even he stands up to it, he makes gelly look like he's almost got a pier.

[03:23:54.340 --> 03:23:58.200]
Well, I tell you, he smelled so rank this morning, I don't know what it was.

[03:23:58.440 --> 03:24:01.300]
I think that it's the pressure from that show, it's there to get to him.

[03:24:01.300 --> 03:24:03.420]
I think he's dumping his pants, seeping.

[03:24:04.100 --> 03:24:04.860]
That could have been it.

[03:24:07.080 --> 03:24:08.220]
WDQAM, seeping with the enemy.

[03:24:08.560 --> 03:24:09.200]
Yeah, with a nail.

[03:24:09.440 --> 03:24:10.340]
I beg your pardon? Yes, sir.

[03:24:11.160 --> 03:24:11.700]
This is a nail?

[03:24:11.920 --> 03:24:12.520]
It sounds like me.

[03:24:13.180 --> 03:24:14.640]
Oh, he sounds different than from Norega.

[03:24:14.720 --> 03:24:15.040]
Oh, sorry.

[03:24:16.200 --> 03:24:20.980]
Listen, I love your show and we can be friends in this degree on the war, okay?

[03:24:21.260 --> 03:24:21.260]

[03:24:22.240 --> 03:24:22.420]
Huh?

[03:24:22.700 --> 03:24:22.920]
Yeah.

[03:24:23.620 --> 03:24:28.720]
I don't think we're friends, I mean, you can call the show and we can, we can converse, but that doesn't make us friends.

[03:24:29.220 --> 03:24:29.560]
Yeah.

[03:24:29.560 --> 03:24:29.960]
Yeah.

[03:24:30.860 --> 03:24:34.740]
Well, you know, in the beginning, I was opposed to the war, okay?

[03:24:35.300 --> 03:24:37.900]
But I feel like we've got to do something about it.

[03:24:38.620 --> 03:24:39.920]
Do something about it.

[03:24:39.920 --> 03:24:41.140]
We have to do something about what?

[03:24:42.180 --> 03:24:45.240]
Well, for example, after 9-11, right?

[03:24:45.420 --> 03:24:47.620]
Two months later, we got another bombing just as that.

[03:24:47.960 --> 03:24:49.460]
And two months later, we got what?

[03:24:50.220 --> 03:24:52.440]
Another bombing or whatever, plane crash.

[03:24:53.520 --> 03:24:58.760]
Similar thing that happens to World Trade Center.

[03:24:59.500 --> 03:25:01.340]
You're talking about the plane that crashed in Long Island?

[03:25:01.360 --> 03:25:02.360]
That had nothing to do with that.

[03:25:02.480 --> 03:25:03.460]
That was an active terrorism.

[03:25:03.680 --> 03:25:06.740]
No, no, no, no, I'm saying if we had a bomb or something.

[03:25:06.740 --> 03:25:08.700]
But sir, we didn't, I don't know what you're talking about.

[03:25:08.720 --> 03:25:09.480]
We didn't have.

[03:25:09.760 --> 03:25:10.680]
I know we didn't.

[03:25:10.760 --> 03:25:11.940]
I'm saying if we did.

[03:25:12.020 --> 03:25:12.780]
But we didn't.

[03:25:12.900 --> 03:25:13.760]
We didn't.

[03:25:14.420 --> 03:25:15.640]
Don't give me what if.

[03:25:15.780 --> 03:25:19.400]
What if Iraq, what if Sodom came down and took a dump on your living room carpet?

[03:25:19.500 --> 03:25:20.680]
Okay, you'd be pissed off.

[03:25:20.920 --> 03:25:21.960]
What if the Martians attacked?

[03:25:22.180 --> 03:25:23.660]
Oh my god.

[03:25:23.740 --> 03:25:24.200]
Oh my god.

[03:25:24.200 --> 03:25:24.680]
Oh my god.

[03:25:25.060 --> 03:25:25.920]
Look, I'm sorry.

[03:25:26.320 --> 03:25:26.700]
I'm sorry.

[03:25:26.700 --> 03:25:29.080]
See, and then I'll say, will you see people disagree with you?

[03:25:29.200 --> 03:25:29.600]
They won't call.

[03:25:30.280 --> 03:25:31.420]
What's there to listen to?

[03:25:31.540 --> 03:25:32.820]
This man is making up Kaka.

[03:25:33.080 --> 03:25:34.740]
He's making up poops all they got.

[03:25:35.900 --> 03:25:39.480]
If chicken, if chickens, peed man, it would be a flood all over the place.

[03:25:41.280 --> 03:25:43.740]
If Moe was a good guy, we might be speaking to him.

[03:25:43.740 --> 03:25:46.720]
You know, I mean, all of these things that are just not happening and not going to happen.

[03:25:47.840 --> 03:25:50.900]
I thought maybe I missed something when he started at, well, two months later,

[03:25:50.960 --> 03:25:54.160]
there were, well, if, if, if he could go.

[03:25:54.160 --> 03:25:59.160]
Let me say it again, the attacks on this country were perpetrated by an organization

[03:25:59.700 --> 03:26:01.400]
a terrorist group called Al Qaeda.

[03:26:01.720 --> 03:26:05.340]
That's what we went, and why we went into Afghanistan and why most of their ass out,

[03:26:05.340 --> 03:26:09.300]
and we went around the world and secretly and not so secretly,

[03:26:09.480 --> 03:26:13.060]
convert, and overtly, we eliminated them and rounded them up and whatever we could do.

[03:26:13.400 --> 03:26:13.700]
Fine.

[03:26:13.860 --> 03:26:14.240]
No problem.

[03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:15.020]
All for that.

[03:26:15.440 --> 03:26:15.960]
All for it.

[03:26:16.080 --> 03:26:16.380]
A young hoe.

[03:26:16.480 --> 03:26:17.620]
Maybe go get him.

[03:26:17.700 --> 03:26:18.360]
Give him what for?

[03:26:19.540 --> 03:26:22.260]
But the idea that all of a sudden, because, like I said,

[03:26:22.260 --> 03:26:26.480]
if somebody down the street comes and takes a dump on your lawn,

[03:26:26.800 --> 03:26:30.000]
and you can't find out where he lives, so the next thing you do is you go across the street

[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:32.420]
and dump on their lawn to get even with, even though you know, it wasn't them.

[03:26:33.600 --> 03:26:35.520]
Well, what are we talking about here?

[03:26:35.640 --> 03:26:36.940]
Talk about irrationality.

[03:26:37.540 --> 03:26:38.620]
Talk about a stretch.

[03:26:38.800 --> 03:26:39.640]
That's what it's all about.

[03:26:39.760 --> 03:26:40.380]
They're stretching it.

[03:26:41.100 --> 03:26:44.820]
And that's why they're so desperately even trying to convince you and world opinion about it.

[03:26:44.820 --> 03:26:47.300]
Oh, well, you know, we know that they've got connections to Al Qaeda,

[03:26:47.420 --> 03:26:49.040]
and we know that they've gone this and they've done that,

[03:26:49.260 --> 03:26:50.900]
and that they've got weapons of mass destruction.

[03:26:50.900 --> 03:26:54.880]
So far, all it's still, even at this point, is nothing but conjecture.

[03:26:55.500 --> 03:26:56.500]
They found those suits.

[03:26:56.680 --> 03:27:01.640]
And you can be damn sure if they found anything they'd be preyed in around like the guy named Macy's Parade.

[03:27:02.220 --> 03:27:04.180]
They'd be on TV 25 hours a day.

[03:27:05.260 --> 03:27:06.840]
Stick it in your, and your push.

[03:27:08.400 --> 03:27:13.360]
Sir, all I can say is I feel sorry for us, for people as thoughtless as you,

[03:27:14.160 --> 03:27:16.260]
who are so willing to, you want to be a living.

[03:27:16.500 --> 03:27:17.940]
See, I mean, it's one thing to become a living.

[03:27:18.040 --> 03:27:19.320]
It's nothing to want to become one.

[03:27:19.320 --> 03:27:22.080]
And you want to be, you want to go step, you want to just fall into line

[03:27:22.080 --> 03:27:24.040]
and believe whatever bull crap they pedal to you.

[03:27:24.060 --> 03:27:24.800]
You know what I'm saying?

[03:27:24.940 --> 03:27:25.380]
Are you sure?

[03:27:25.460 --> 03:27:25.800]
Oh, yes.

[03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:26.380]
But what if?

[03:27:28.040 --> 03:27:28.680]
Chicken's peed.

[03:27:29.540 --> 03:27:30.460]
And can't be enough.

[03:27:30.460 --> 03:27:31.680]
You know where chicken pees and Massachusetts.

[03:27:32.120 --> 03:27:32.540]
It's in butts.

[03:27:32.680 --> 03:27:35.600]
And by the way, that's where we're going to invade next because we're telling all the liberals up there.

[03:27:36.300 --> 03:27:39.100]
So once we get done in Iraq, Iran and Syria, and maybe North Korea,

[03:27:39.100 --> 03:27:40.480]
then we're moving to do a Massachusetts.

[03:27:41.160 --> 03:27:43.960]
And all those other blue states you know around the Indian, they voted for Gourmet.

[03:27:44.380 --> 03:27:44.380]

[03:27:44.560 --> 03:27:45.160]
Well, see you.

[03:27:45.160 --> 03:27:45.460]
We're going to have to get that in order.

[03:27:47.420 --> 03:27:49.240]
1251 at 560 WQA.

[03:27:49.280 --> 03:27:53.020]
And if your carpets look like crap, man, if they've been invaded by grime and dust and schmutz,

[03:27:53.520 --> 03:27:54.180]
how's the answer?

[03:27:54.280 --> 03:27:55.580]
The answer is to make one easy call.

[03:27:55.700 --> 03:27:58.240]
You know how easy it is when you're smart, when you've got all these phone numbers?

[03:27:58.620 --> 03:28:02.860]
Call our good friends and drive concepts, and they'll make your carpets look and smell and feel just like brand new,

[03:28:02.860 --> 03:28:05.000]
like they've been doing my house for over 21 years now.

[03:28:06.300 --> 03:28:08.560]
Drive concepts are still around while the others have come and gone,

[03:28:08.560 --> 03:28:10.020]
because they do a stupendous job.

[03:28:10.020 --> 03:28:12.400]
They give you a guaranteed written price before they start the job.

[03:28:12.400 --> 03:28:16.000]
So unlike most carpets cleaning companies that specialize in ripoffs and scams,

[03:28:16.140 --> 03:28:17.720]
never have them with drive concepts.

[03:28:17.940 --> 03:28:19.580]
Written guaranteed price right up front.

[03:28:19.880 --> 03:28:22.160]
When they get done with the job, they give you a rose, you hand them a check,

[03:28:22.240 --> 03:28:25.480]
and everybody's got a big smile on their push, because you'll look at that carpeting and say,

[03:28:25.560 --> 03:28:28.900]
holy crap, it looks just like I've had brand new carpeting later to factor the price.

[03:28:29.360 --> 03:28:31.320]
And they also do a stupendous job of cleaning your poster,

[03:28:31.460 --> 03:28:34.980]
leather furniture, your area and rugs, and your expensive oriental rugs as well.

[03:28:35.300 --> 03:28:36.920]
Nobody does it anywhere like drive concepts.

[03:28:37.380 --> 03:28:41.060]
Problems with pet orders, milder orders caused by water damage, they'll make those go away too.

[03:28:41.060 --> 03:28:42.800]
Do yourself a humongous favor.

[03:28:42.980 --> 03:28:45.020]
What you got to do is do business with these people one time,

[03:28:45.380 --> 03:28:47.980]
and all your carpet cleaning problems will be done for the rest of your life,

[03:28:48.040 --> 03:28:49.360]
because you'll never use anybody else again.

[03:28:49.900 --> 03:28:53.800]
Call them tool free from anywhere, 1-800-248-5071.

[03:28:54.320 --> 03:28:58.820]
1-800-248-5071, or log on to their website at driveconcepts.com.

[03:28:59.080 --> 03:29:02.340]
Don't forget with drive concepts clean today, you can entertain tonight.

[03:29:02.580 --> 03:29:04.460]
My name is Engloucall.

[03:29:04.860 --> 03:29:06.060]
This is 420-516.

[03:29:07.080 --> 03:29:08.440]
You are a new way.

[03:29:29.240 --> 03:29:35.060]
Are you fudge back?

[03:29:35.060 --> 03:29:37.060]
No.

[03:30:14.820 --> 03:30:35.020]
I'm a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

[03:30:35.020 --> 03:31:04.960]
of a little bit of what is Sit and O A and have me stretch my feet, my hips and both my knees and my shoulders I have the arms, my knees and my lower shoulder, my hips and up my toes I have my toes and legs, my hips and green, my shoulders, my shoulders are the same.

[03:31:04.960 --> 03:31:04.980]
belly, my chin and my tummy I have my bum, my stomach make down my seated feet I have my $18 sportろies of cumasses from around myとouth

[03:31:04.980 --> 03:31:05.000]
to my head I have my produção of cor Technical University hardcore consequences of something like that

[03:31:06.260 --> 03:31:09.540]
593 votes on a poll. Look it up on eorangeers.com. I don't want to waste a

[03:31:09.540 --> 03:31:13.220]
valuable time to read that thing, okay? Because it's such a very serious poll.

[03:31:13.620 --> 03:31:16.580]
Such a heavy duty thing that's going to change the world. Why don't you do your

[03:31:16.580 --> 03:31:19.960]
poll on a lighter thing like what's your favorite day of the week? What's your

[03:31:19.960 --> 03:31:25.580]
favorite holiday? Huh? Robert. What's your favorite kind of cardio? A rear end.

[03:31:26.460 --> 03:31:30.400]
What's your favorite rear end? That other pay, it's in, this must be

[03:31:30.400 --> 03:31:36.180]
monumental whatever he sent in me, man. It's just, uh, here we go. Here we go. Let's see it.

[03:31:37.660 --> 03:31:40.080]
Great show today. Hope they didn't have anything to do with my not being there.

[03:31:40.160 --> 03:31:43.180]
As a matter of fact, Carlos, not that you mentioned that George wasn't so

[03:31:43.180 --> 03:31:45.820]
distracted the whole show. Actually, we were communicating here and now that

[03:31:45.820 --> 03:31:49.400]
man, huh? No, seriously, you made him into like George Jr. Now all of a

[03:31:49.400 --> 03:31:52.840]
thing just sits in there and pat pat pat the whole show. Just want to say thanks

[03:31:52.840 --> 03:31:55.360]
again for the tickets. We had a great time. Even though we lost the game greatly

[03:31:55.360 --> 03:31:59.060]
appreciate it. Maybe we can get a first hand report tomorrow from Carlos if he shows

[03:31:59.060 --> 03:32:02.660]
up for work unless his dogs got diarrhea again and find out about those

[03:32:02.660 --> 03:32:07.960]
water list urinals. Oh, I'm urinating to find out about that. Also, please take

[03:32:07.960 --> 03:32:10.900]
a look at our new cartoon page. He's working on it, but it's getting there and

[03:32:10.900 --> 03:32:12.820]
tell me what you think. Whatever you're doing, it's great. Okay,

[03:32:12.960 --> 03:32:17.820]
being a boy, you're doing a great job. Keep it up. Okay. He is. He's doing a great job.

[03:32:17.880 --> 03:32:27.540]
And of course, there's Eric WDQ I am. Allow me. Yes. How would you? WDQ I am.

[03:32:28.960 --> 03:32:32.080]
Yeah, yes, sir. Is this time to start the Neil still? I beg your pardon you

[03:32:32.080 --> 03:32:38.940]
go ahead you run right now. Okay. Hello. Yeah. Yes, sir. Neil. Yeah. Hey,

[03:32:39.060 --> 03:32:42.900]
just wanted to say I love that bit on the about 30 man. Do you?

[03:32:43.480 --> 03:32:48.140]
But 30 man. Okay. Well, I would play it, but if I play it in here then it's

[03:32:48.140 --> 03:32:51.920]
going to like. But 30 man. Oh, thank goodness. I don't you know what I'm saying? I

[03:32:51.920 --> 03:32:54.340]
want to like to carry over to that other crap at the end of the show. I have to be

[03:32:54.340 --> 03:32:57.140]
very careful to cue that stuff up for the end of the show so I don't get it wrong.

[03:32:57.140 --> 03:33:01.800]
Because when you get to be old and feebrile like me, when you get to be as old as

[03:33:01.800 --> 03:33:14.000]
Mo WDQ I am. Hello. Hello. Yes. Yeah. Speaking. Is this Neil Roger? Yes ma'am. Oh, Neil. Yes, I am.

[03:33:14.340 --> 03:33:19.940]
My neighbors next door. They put it. You want flag on top of the roof. Yeah. I'm upset

[03:33:19.940 --> 03:33:27.060]
about that. Where are you from? I have a yeah. Well, I think they did the right thing. How do you like that?

[03:33:31.440 --> 03:33:36.540]
Wow. That was sensational. I told you to see it. Just take the right. The number calls

[03:33:36.540 --> 03:33:41.640]
there at the end. Then you get the winner jackpot. How many calls would you have to take to get

[03:33:41.640 --> 03:33:50.920]
one like that? Yeah. 30,000. That was sensational. She's from Haley. So what else you

[03:33:50.920 --> 03:33:56.200]
complain into? Viva Cuba. Viva Cuba. Like to hell with Fidel. I say let's bring the

[03:33:56.200 --> 03:33:59.400]
troops back and go in and kick Fidel's ass. All right. Don't you think that's a good idea?

[03:33:59.800 --> 03:34:02.760]
Wouldn't take that many. How come they're not screaming about that little van? I realize

[03:34:02.760 --> 03:34:06.180]
it makes a lot of sense, which may be part of the reason. But how? Why aren't they screaming?

[03:34:06.300 --> 03:34:10.220]
He's an evil doer. He's done all these terrible things. He's a brutal ruthless dictator.

[03:34:10.640 --> 03:34:11.560]
They have no free elections.
