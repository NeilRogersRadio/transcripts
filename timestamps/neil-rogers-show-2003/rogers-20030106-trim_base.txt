[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.140]
Oh my!

[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.520]
What's the matter, pal?

[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.200]
Prozac not working.

[00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.180]
Lithium just doesn't seem to do it for you anymore.

[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.040]
Are you unable to cope?

[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.460]
Then you need to talk to your doctor about new faggot-all.

[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.280]
In laws coming for the holidays?

[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.980]
Faggot-all.

[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.600]
Boss writing you again.

[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.100]
Faggot-all.

[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.060]
Wife being a pain in the ass.

[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.820]
Faggot-all.

[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.800]
Faggot-all has been prescribed in Europe for years.

[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.760]
And thanks to a loophole and FDA regulations

[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.940]
is now available in the good ol' U.S. of A.

[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.820]
Patients using faggot-all should be aware of the following side effects.

[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.780]
Oil-edish charge, spontaneous air loss,

[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.440]
genitals shrinking, hysterical blindness,

[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.380]
kidney stones, unsightly nail fungus,

[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.760]
rectal bleeding and worms.

[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.740]
So, when the pressures of everyday life get you down...

[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.440]
I need this on my desk by seven o'clock!

[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.160]
The test came back positive.

[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.160]
I'm pregnant.

[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.100]
Mommy!

[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.420]
Just reach for that little blue bottle and say...

[00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.480]
faggot-all.

[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.680]
I can tell you right now.

[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.180]
Yeah.

[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.720]
Yeah.

[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.000]
That.

[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.300]
Anyway, come bad news, man.

[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.780]
It's a very sad news, and I'm extraordinarily depressed.

[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.820]
I don't know why I'm so depressed.

[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.640]
It's not like he was a close personal friend, but he was a good guy.

[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.400]
Yes.

[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.280]
We like Micronary.

[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.300]
Haven't I always consistently said that on the show?

[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.900]
Yes, I have.

[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.340]
And what a contrast in those great days at IOD coming on mid days following Micronarian

[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.280]
in the morning as opposed to what we got now.

[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.560]
On two legs.

[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.440]
That's what we got.

[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.320]
You tert.

[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.240]
Excrement on two legs is what we got preceding us now as opposed to a really good guy, Micronary.

[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.020]
Never, never created any waves, never stole a freight train, and Mike died on Friday.

[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.160]
In fact, I just amazing.

[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.920]
You look back at IOD and you know what, who I blame?

[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.200]
Bob Neal.

[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.180]
Bob Neal, Bob Green, Cox Broadcasting, killed Micronary.

[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.220]
All you young punks out there that want to go into radio, don't do it.

[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.760]
Do not do it.

[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.760]
I've been telling you that for a hundred years and my advice today is stronger than ever because I've seen it happen.

[00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.860]
If you work in this business long enough sooner or later, somebody in management will ruin your life and screw your ass over.

[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.060]
No, I don't believe you.

[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.360]
Or maybe somebody, you're not even in management.

[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.720]
Not to mention Mo again.

[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.440]
Because the Mo I think about him, the sicker I get.

[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.600]
Before I get back to my Neal, which I want to talk about him for a little while, like maybe four hours,

[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.960]
you people out there, you've got to grow up.

[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.140]
Are you ever going to grow up?

[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.420]
No.

[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.840]
I heard a call on this station on Friday that had to be all of the other ones, even the guy that talked about aren't we blessed here Jim?

[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.820]
This on a mad dog show.

[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.100]
Jimbo, where are we going to do?

[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.260]
I want to happen.

[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.320]
And this was before the Herkhooons lost that game.

[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.160]
This was still about the Miami game, which was five days before.

[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.480]
When you please, please, you sport nerds, get a goddamn life.

[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.340]
Get your priorities in order.

[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.820]
It's just a game.

[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.060]
If that's your life, it's time to like end it all.

[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.260]
F**k it all and end it all.

[00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.780]
That's right.

[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.160]
Pop a couple in your purse and then blow your brains out and save the fresh air for somebody else that might have put it to some good use.

[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.960]
Jimbo, why do we go?

[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.600]
I'd love to have that call on tape.

[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.200]
Oh, I'd love to have that.

[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.560]
Just a few lines.

[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]
I mean, sounded like his dog just had wild diarrhea all over the middle of his bed while he was in it.

[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.940]
Why do we go to jail?

[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.220]
And then that asshole who called from Ohio State called us, he calls Eddie Kaplan.

[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.640]
Same one.

[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.660]
Oh, well, we've been listening on the internet all day and how come you guys aren't talking about the...

[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.680]
...but all this other crap.

[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.160]
So if this town was that depressed before the Huracunz game, and I heard also people call it into the Mad Dog stand,

[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.880]
well, you know, that game's in a pass.

[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.020]
Let's forget about the dolphin because we got the national championship now.

[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.020]
Uh-oh.

[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.300]
Uh-oh.

[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.300]
Something happened on it.

[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.740]
And if anybody believed me that I was going to root for the Huracunz, did you believe that?

[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.240]
Were you buying?

[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.360]
Duff comes running in here with the U of M T shirt.

[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.020]
I just said that just to piss off those idiots from Columbus.

[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.920]
That's all.

[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.540]
Just to discourage them from continuing their abrid behavior and wasting our time with their calls.

[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.000]
With a disgrace.

[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.880]
The day I root for the Huracunz will be okay.

[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.380]
That'll be the day that I go in there and give a big kiss to Mo on his bald spot.

[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.360]
That'll be the same day when I start rooting for that outfit.

[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.500]
And they're going to be whining about the interference call.

[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.740]
And I see even the governor headed chime in on that.

[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.220]
You see that?

[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.480]
Even governor Jebsdor.

[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.820]
Sucking around for you.

[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.380]
You don't have to suck around for votes in the Gables.

[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.540]
He's got them all locked up.

[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.720]
Sucking their ass.

[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.500]
Anyway, getting back to this story, very depressing.

[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.360]
Micronary 60 South Florida radio personality for almost three decades.

[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.040]
Now, the great entertainers is what W.I.D. was during those days.

[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.140]
The heyday of that before we really went into another era.

[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.740]
Big Wilson, Bill Calder, my good close personal friend.

[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.920]
And the Micronary.

[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.980]
They were the great entertainers and now they're all dead.

[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.200]
Hello.

[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.040]
Welcome to Ving Radio.

[00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.020]
Right, they're all dead.

[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.540]
At all three great guys.

[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.540]
That's the thing that pisses me off.

[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.180]
The sports guys on a state at that time, Rick Weaver and Sunny Hersh, they're dead.

[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.580]
One of the two good guys.

[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.900]
Well, we've ridden the smell too good.

[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.080]
I got along fine with him.

[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.780]
Me too?

[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.100]
Yeah, we liked Rick Weaver as a matter of fact.

[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.280]
Let me, there's another good example for you.

[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.540]
Back in those days, we had Ranirias delete in.

[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.740]
And we had Rick Weaver doing it off a game.

[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.120]
A fan's beginning to blow the blow the, who the waste election.

[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.200]
How do you like that, Mr. Weaver?

[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.920]
Don't make mistakes.

[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.940]
So maybe it didn't smell so good.

[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.460]
But he liked to beat his feet on the Mississippi, how's that go?

[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.880]
Mud.

[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.380]
Mud.

[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.420]
Not when he retired, when they actually forced him into retirement.

[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.540]
He went out to Mississippi after his wife died.

[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.420]
Had himself a good time.

[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.020]
Maybe a little bit too good of a time, but then he died.

[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.020]
Mike Weaver, one of the first funny morning show personalities in the 1960s

[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.820]
in the popular voice in South Florida radio for 27 years died Friday after

[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.780]
a brief illness he was 60.

[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.400]
How come the Sunset will miss this story, Tom Jicca?

[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.160]
Oh, wait till I get to Tom Jicca.

[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.380]
And his big story Saturday about the end run movie that unless you got 18 satellite dishes like I do,

[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.860]
you don't see in South Florida last night because they preempted it for a stupid heat pass

[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.220]
to ball game where the heat lost by another 80 points.

[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.300]
Thank God for having 40 satellite dishes.

[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.200]
Tom.

[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.380]
Now, maybe I didn't miss it.

[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.900]
Maybe he wasn't a Sunset over the weekend and I just didn't see it.

[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.700]
You think that's possible?

[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.880]
Highly unlikely.

[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.380]
Renewary known for his folks he's style spent the latter part of his radio career on Waxi AM790

[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.620]
where he hosted the morning drive from 1993 to 1998.

[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.660]
But I didn't realize he was there that long, did you?

[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:33.580]
You did?

[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.500]
Yeah.

[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.000]
One is contract expired.

[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.200]
In the early 80s, he's been a popular host on WIOD610.

[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.880]
A supporter of a charitable causes in Miami over the years, Renewary raised hundreds of thousands of dollars

[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.120]
for the Boys and Girls Club serving on its board of directors for several years.

[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.900]
In November 2001, Renewary was inducted into the Ohio Radio and TV Broadcasters Hall of Fame

[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.460]
and recognized on the floor of Congress by a long-time friend and former Mayor of Cleveland,

[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.420]
U.S. Representative Dennis Kassinich.

[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:04.120]
Born June 9, 1942 in Pittsburgh, Kansas, not in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.300]
but Pittsburgh, Kansas, which I never heard of until this moment.

[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.920]
Renewary grew up mostly in North Carolina during his 46-year radio career.

[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.240]
Renewary worked in Chicago, Atlanta, Jacksonville, and Cleveland.

[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.180]
An addition was wife Barbara and children Mark Renewary, Jennifer Goldstein, Leslie Russo.

[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.480]
Renewary survived by daughter-in-law Robin Renewary of Atlanta and four grandchildren.

[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.260]
And we sent our condolences to Barbara and the whole Renewary family.

[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.580]
In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in Renewary's name to the Boys and Girls Club of Miami,

[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.600]
the charity of your choice.

[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.660]
Private services have already been held.

[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.320]
Breedy Pressing, Grace said, I blame the Cox people they ruined them.

[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.520]
And I also blame your good-fat friend, Henry Barrow.

[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.820]
And Mark Benson, bald-headed Mark Benson, who stabbed him in the back at Waxi.

[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.700]
How do you like that?

[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.680]
Nice going, Henry.

[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.720]
By the way, Henry, I don't think you're going to be around too long.

[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.520]
You're getting really fat.

[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.060]
He was in here like back in November with his lovely daughter.

[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.000]
She's lovely. He's not.

[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.440]
Yeah, remember when they stabbed the poor Mikey in the back here?

[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.520]
Took over that show. They took the show away from him.

i went over to fm first which is going to lead me to our pool today

[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.940]
i wonder if i'm you couldn't find a song you ever wanted to hear on fm in this

[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.520]
market if you went if you walked into the studio of the station with a god damn

[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.940]
uzi and stuck into the program directors head they'd still be playing

[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.180]

[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.980]
that i hope rich jobs less than right now can i know what time works on anymore

[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:38.800]

[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.340]
years

[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.520]

[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.860]
pd bulldozer he's an asshole worse than that

[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.680]
in fact when you call pd bulldozer an asshole it's an insult to every asshole on

[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.540]
the face of this planet

[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.380]
tragic so i'm i'm punching around i can't find a song i want to hear in our

[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.120]

[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.140]
what the shmitmeister is doing

[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.780]

[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.920]
smithmeister which i already told you the whiny self-hating right wing

[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:31.580]
mess drudge mad drudge is on there and i thought to myself oh no and his

[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.340]
guess though less was the even more anxious and culture

[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.840]
and all of a sudden i started getting this

[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.640]
smell this heavy smell from my radio speakers in the car i had like rolled on

[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.780]
the windows because it was nice and cool out anyway

[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.360]

miss grudge there's a great book in fact he inspired me when i heard his right

[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.580]

[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.460]
past three years i stayed out of the news news the tend to attempt to find a

[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:24.080]
sense of peace emotional balance and personal integrity that had eluded me

[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.840]
during my dozen years in the right wing i had no plan to desire to speak against

[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.820]

[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.320]
sent will totally blew it Harold bearing it back in the old bit section it would seem to me that when

[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:15.420]
you work on a radio in this market for nearly 30 years that you deserve a little bit better than

[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:19.820]
just to be back in the obituaries with a little tiny blurb like this and we i mean i mean maybe

[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:25.040]
i'm wrong but he was somebody in this market he meant something to a lot of people in this market

[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.240]
huh i'm more than pressed about his dying than i was bill caulder and bill was a good friend of mine

[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:35.240]
one of my best friends you know what i mean i don't know why i'm in bill i'm in bill uh huh i

[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:40.900]
always a great guy but i mean he had cancer and it was like not it was a shock that he died so fast

[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.720]
he went very fast but it wasn't that we didn't know he was going to die at least within a few months

[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.760]
but this just comes out of the blue

[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.560]
189 but i guess i better do the break before we get those poll results then we got the new poll

[00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:00.880]
about the FM stations you can't complain about the music on a radio in this time because

[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:49.380]
heard that news that that's just that's since did for me I had a lot of thoughts about this whole

[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:54.500]
most of over the weekend least 20 seconds worth and I thought you know what my response my whole

[00:32:54.500 --> 00:33:01.500]
conclusion of the deal f him f him that was my response screw him excrement on two legs

[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:38.620]
what should need to do regarding mode during 2003 we asked on friday and I must say this naive me

[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:42.480]
coming back Thursday and friday last week I should have just taken the rest of the week off what's

[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.220]
another couple they they wouldn't send anything what would they have said what I sure is a long

[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:52.400]
vacation yeah and and what about it everybody else here was going to step poor muffa was in

[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.700]
there working over that radio feverishly he sits in there with his hand on the dial during the whole

[00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:03.800]
show now he's cranked off the volume turning it down he's fine tuning well what else is he going to do

[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:11.560]
that back early a little macrame I think he does that with the other hand origami 1103 votes what

[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:16.540]
should need to do regarding mode during 2003 rip him some mo now the amazing part about this for

[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.520]
those who didn't listen friday which is almost everybody that was a late addition to the poll right

[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:28.580]
near the end of the show which is my own omission rip him some more 499 45.2 percent rip him some mo

[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:35.740]
oh and we will we will as the mood strikes us like maybe every 10 seconds steel is here piece

[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:42.760]
250 22.6 percent stick by his guns ignore him meaning I should stick by my guns 182 and then we got

[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:48.740]
these two other categories which total between them only 15.4 percent kiss and make up 90 and make

[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:54.800]
peace 81 that's only 15 point so 85 percent of the audience has got a hostile attitude toward the

[00:34:54.800 --> 00:35:00.760]
moe master and he can point fingers at me anybody else but he's got nobody to blame but himself

[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:07.020]
came in here alienated everybody even before he got on the air alienated all the sports nerds

[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:11.940]
came on alienated us by start with George and all that crap and then it's gone downhill from there

[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:18.520]
so the fact that reneary died over the weekend this is just just another reminder of what was

[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:23.500]
like in the old day because you know what we were having fun we were having fun we had a good time

[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:30.300]
I remember the day that my cat is what was it is 20th anniversary on a urine town something like

[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.080]
that and they asked me to go in here and I went in the studio he was just in heaven the fact that I

[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:39.200]
did that for him not that was a big deal was what was like a great deal of effort he was just a very

[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:47.520]
simple plain easy go a nice guy no pretensions no pompous ass routine no talking down to people no

[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.920]
brow beating the people that worked with him no blowing people off the show all the time because of

[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:56.740]
the fact they looked at him cross-eyed and it didn't suck his crack enough you know what I'm talking

[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.920]
about yeah you know exactly what I'm talking about you relate that one day the behind stuck

[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.300]
behind the bridge again or something like right that's where we got that scored scored that's

[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:08.920]
where that came from he may not be with us anymore but he left this scored score left is that

[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.040]
just the you know just the kind of guy who is a pleasure to work with

[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.780]
here's the facts from Carolinus says I saw Mike's obituary in the Sunday here I'll just

[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:23.340]
know a bit with the others no article I wondered if those idiots at the hero knew who he was

[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.320]
then a short article this morning which said nothing more than the old bit which I have right here

[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.960]
I made him once a great guy those were the great days of radio Mike you and Rickon said my

[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:35.420]
sympathies Carolin thanks Carolin those were the great days now we're just let's face it we're

[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:42.000]
just playing out the string here we get nothing thanks again to Greg like I told you off the year

[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:51.980]
when Greg read sent his application his resume to the beastly people years ago right at the top

[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:57.020]
of the resume it said I know how to run a radio station the only problem is perfect it was like

[00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:00.740]
a recommendation from somebody else it's his Greg knows how to run a radio station he airbrushed

[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:10.980]
out the eye in are you I N that's what he did everything was going great and it was like dizzy

[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:16.420]
all over again just like when Bob Neal came down from Atlanta they were getting ready to sabotage

[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:21.320]
when he read I said don't do it we had to launch up at some bogus place in Fort Lauderdale I said don't

[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:25.140]
do it Bob I said and while we did these studies and half of the audience once entertainment have

[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:29.020]
them want news and then they put on that awful Chuck Meyer news show with those awful phone interviews

[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:34.020]
and once they messed with their morning show that station was never the same again and they want

[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:39.540]
of selling it how do you like that a lot of work went into that and the same thing here every time

[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:43.120]
Greg would come in here and start mumbling about the worst team this and a worst team I'd say are

[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:48.620]
they making you money is that show making money well yeah but but but but but my ass and now you

[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:52.780]
screwed it up and we went through months of hell on this station we went through the D.F.O. and the

[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:57.620]
Gellie and the D.F.O. show and the World War what's it Ron Hershey highway show we've gone through hell

[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:03.080]
and now look what we got now look what we got a silly old man with bad verticals veins and 15

[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:12.000]
hair pieces although I do like the one he wears for sookas 18 till 10 well I got to get this

[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:21.280]
emotion out because of all it's all pent up I'm just psychotic psychotic you sit back you think

[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.560]
you know a little bit about this business you watch these other make believe the make pretend

[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.300]
management people who made their whole livelihood with other people's money who run around

[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:34.460]
pretended to be big shots with bad haircuts with other people's money screwing up people's lives

[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.840]
like the fact that this same clown that we're talking about Greg Reed was ready to blow George out

[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:44.500]
of here because of the women some other temperamental or fart I'm just trying to terminate George

[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:49.700]

[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:05.180]
childish nonsense and then he turns around and says the reason it was gonna fire you is because you

[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.240]
actually give me a little publicity well in this particular case it's got

[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.280]

anybody who was uh like the first one what did i say difficult to work with i don't know

most people are reasonably reasonable here's a fact that says did you hear mega one oh three

[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:10.800]
point five change their format it is now playing r and b hip hop you know that wmi v men and black

[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:15.000]
it's a piece of crap it says here it sucks what the hell is going on with cheap channel i hope the

[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.460]
new format fails miserably and so to wait what they're trying to do is destroy every single station

[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:25.140]
that they bought in this market and from coast to coast and all the ships that see as well

[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:30.660]
and do a magnificent job here's how to pull is coming so far the best FM station south floor is

[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:35.920]
they all suck is way ahead thirty nine and you folks are absolutely correct right on

[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:41.120]
wl rn five for the intellectuals in our audience who says we don't have some smart people in

[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:47.460]

[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:03.660]
magic is got five votes big is got three and then from down down and of course you know a lot

[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:06.900]
of these stations we're not going to get too many votes for our people because these are

[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:14.060]
punk stations like y100 and I even gave them a chance over the weekend they suck they blow

[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:22.120]
big oh my god their classic rock my ass in fact i've heard better sounds come out of my ass

[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:26.340]
that i heard coming from big one oh six if they didn't have Howard Spurman or radio they

[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:29.220]
might they'll seriously if they didn't have him anymore they might as well shut that thing down

[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:35.060]
shut it off do everybody a public service another cheap channel abortion by the way just mention

[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:41.780]
that in passing fine now what am I so worked up about today you know i might as well just calm down

[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:46.580]
good to see clearance came back in here shook my hand said they shared a room with the beast

[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:50.400]
said they never saw so in fact he said the beast made him feel better about himself

[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:55.820]
hey he didn't say the beast had a smaller penis but he didn't say that whatever size it is

[00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:59.160]
there's so many layers of fat hanging there you couldn't see it anyway the beast made him feel good

[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:03.640]
beast made him feel good is what he said especially at kneel time said they were ordering

[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:07.420]
room service like one after the other was just a constant parade right to that door you don't

[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:11.220]
think the beast is going to go off the deep end do you there's Miguel's got a bunch of crap here

[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:17.680]
what do you got oh thank you thanks Barbara like i said Miguel's got something good

[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:22.640]
my daughter Leslie phoned me this morning told me to put on your show you were talking about

[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:26.000]
Michael i want to tell you how much i appreciate how much i'm enjoying it it's really making me laugh

[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.660]
and we haven't had many of those these last few weeks but whenever any of us lost it

[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:32.960]
and invariably one of us would come up with what Michael would have said it was cut the crap

[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:41.360]
he didn't say that a lot cut the crap he was he was a funny in a very dry way he was really a very

[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:48.620]
funny guy you just had to uh had a known i've got a little tire to that crap i can tell you right now

[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:52.400]
you see in fact he was probably one of the first people on a radio long before i ever say to say crap

[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:56.820]
i mean there are a lot of people in this business for a crap at least he had the balls to say it

[00:58:56.820 --> 00:59:00.300]
it says i also agree with what you're saying all the people you were saying it about true that

[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:03.080]
you and Michael were never close friends i much didn't know how much you respected you and your

[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:07.380]
talent and you whenever you got into the car i didn't eat calls on my 25th anniversary i think you

[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:12.040]
called it yeah unsolicited whenever you got into the car after we show you put you on it thank you

[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:16.140]

[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:22.880]
in the whole family good guy and again just frost my fat ass that here's a guy i still say you know

[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:26.860]
you can say whatever you want i don't know the details of his death i don't need to know it what

[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:32.620]
but the fact is that it shortens your life when people screw you over the stress factor i mean here's

[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:36.560]
a guy now after all those years and i would do you need to go out and fend for himself i mean the

[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:42.360]
only good he got the last laugh on them though in one respect in december of whatever year that was

[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:47.700]
just before they can't in december they just signed a new contract for a year and they fired him

[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:52.380]
like in january or fibrary so they had to pay him off for that whole year so we could he also had

[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:56.460]
the luxury like some of the rest of us have had thank goodness of getting paid off not to work going

[00:59:56.460 --> 01:00:03.020]
and just going fishing and enjoying the uh yeah which is great so i hope that bob green and bob

[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:15.120]
destroyed see i mean i'm not saying this is a business where there are people deserve to get fired

[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:19.840]
people who don't have any talent people who've got terrible ratings people who like are impossible

[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:25.500]
to work with you know what i'm saying so in any business there people deserve to give can it's

[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:31.760]

[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.340]

[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:28.240]
they don't give a flying crap about North Korea

[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.560]
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Taliban they don't give a crap

[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.280]

[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:55.460]
story we take a good hard stiff look into start them

[01:06:55.460 --> 01:07:01.200]
their hit song is synonymous with the 80s and synonymous with crap they were

[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.380]
kaja goo

[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:13.240]
what's interesting is that in America you say kaja goo goo but in England we call kaja goo

[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.520]
this minor difference in pronunciation was the only interesting thing about the band

[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:23.360]
that lead singer Lamol could ever find as you'll see tonight in a 1983 interview

[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:27.900]

[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:51.360]
Lamol's real name was Chris Hamill but he had a change to Lamol after a psychic told him

[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:57.360]
where his music would one day take him to the mall to the record stores and eventually the

[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:03.320]
299 bin 99 cents for the cassette that's not really true but it wasn't worth asking on

[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:09.340]
how he came up with a fucked up name like Lamol it's a big juicy stopping wet look at show

[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:15.260]

[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:04.240]
when I hear the team at that point was only two points out of first place hotter and a firecracker on the road

[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:21.080]

[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:37.400]
the city is here

[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.400]
Let the whole man one of us take!

[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.040]
Oi!

[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.180]
10.32 to 5.60 W to QAM.

[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.800]
150 votes on the poll so far. The best FM state in South Florida.

[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.640]
Here we got several on head zero.

[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:55.720]
CMQ's got one, kisses got one, M-I-B, men in black's got one.

[01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:56.920]
There's your audience, Dennis.

[01:20:58.060 --> 01:20:58.500]
One.

[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:01.520]
I say Dennis David, whatever his name is.

[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.060]
Dave Ross, Dennis, it's the kind of the same person.

[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:07.040]
Loves got one, why 100 appear, life has got two.

[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:09.620]
Power three, party radio four.

[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:11.240]
There you go, Disney, you're really doing it baby.

[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.780]
When that crap you keep playing over and over again.

[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:14.560]
Safry duo and duo safry.

[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:19.960]
EDR's got five, what that's shocking isn't it?

[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.340]
WEDR be having five votes on it in this crowd?

[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:25.440]
But that's probably some white punk.

[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:27.080]
So you don't think we got no shfarts in this, do you?

[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:27.880]
A couple.

[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:31.700]
Yeah, a couple like old Joe and Joe Mama.

[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.000]
And like the car wash guys.

[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:36.460]
But they know listen to EDR.

[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:39.800]
Those are young punks, punks listen to WEDR.

[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.440]
Okay, they're jamming it.

[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:43.400]
Zed has got seven, magic.

[01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:44.880]
WMXJ has got eleven.

[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.220]
Big has got twelve and WLRNs 14.

[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.060]
They all suck 83.

[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.820]
They all suck is way ahead of everybody else.

[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:51.900]
In fact, I think they all suck.

[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.440]
Is that everybody else put together?

[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.500]
You're fine, I'll check it.

[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:55.880]
Absolutely correct.

[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:56.700]
That's right.

[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:57.900]
How do you like that?

[01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:00.180]
And if all the other ones put together,

[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:01.680]
your FM music sucks.

[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.600]
Why not try and play some real music?

[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:07.260]
Why not bring in a program director with an IQ larger than his penis, okay?

[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:14.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.200]
Here's a call from Bokeh, hello.

[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.360]
You're the best without you.

[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.860]
This one, and George is great.

[01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:24.480]
Let me tell you the whole staff.

[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:28.880]
You know I offer you a fast way in Rochester, New York, Andy Palumbo.

[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.480]
And listen, how do I handle my phone?

[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:33.040]
I don't talk to old Farts on a show case or get out of here.

[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:34.680]
Don't put old Farts on here.

[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:35.400]
Didn't sell that old.

[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:37.440]
I don't know Andy Palumbo in Rochester, New York.

[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.480]
I never heard of him and he's not an old friend of mine.

[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:40.900]
And you're an old old old.

[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:44.320]
Just get the goddamn toe jam out of your ears and go out and play some majrong.

[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:44.700]
Will you sir?

[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:45.940]
It's a nice brisk day.

[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:46.980]
Go out and have another brisk.

[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:48.680]
Get out of my face.

[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.760]
Well, speaking of get out of my face, so during the break, guess who calls us?

[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:52.340]
Right away.

[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:55.780]
Calls George was on the phone for about three seconds until I identified himself.

[01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:59.080]
Greg from Port St. Loosely.

[01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:02.860]
Don't you understand it?

[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:03.300]
What now?

[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:04.520]
What would it be exactly to be say?

[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:06.340]
I'm pissed off.

[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:06.640]
Good.

[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:07.800]
This is Greg from Good.

[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:09.120]
And you know what?

[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.100]
That's the idea, Greg.

[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:12.820]
I don't want to know from you.

[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:15.440]
If you want to listen to the show, it's like all the other people,

[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:18.920]
the overwhelming majority of our audience, especially this audience,

[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.560]
they sit back and they listen.

[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.040]
They don't call.

[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:22.680]
Okay?

[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.260]
They don't feel compelled to call.

[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.440]
They don't come to the track and get in my face.

[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.480]
They don't try to invade my space.

[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.460]
They listen.

[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:30.540]
It's a radio show.

[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:30.820]
Okay?

[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:31.700]
It's my livelihood.

[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.220]
It's free entertainment.

[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:34.320]
Take it or leave it.

[01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.480]
In your case, leave it.

[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:38.520]
I don't want to see you.

[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.460]
I do remember you.

[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:40.080]
Believe me.

[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:40.480]
I remember you.

[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.800]
I couldn't forget you if I tried.

[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:44.540]
If they give me a lobotomy, I couldn't get you out of my mind.

[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.380]
Because you're a no life.

[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:50.300]
Even Dick Feinberg said, if you don't come back to Pomfano Park again,

[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:51.160]
it'll be too soon.

[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:51.840]
How do you like that?

[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:54.340]
He said, he don't mind what's his name.

[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.480]
The Reverend Jones guy.

[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.900]
He's okay with a bad baseball cap.

[01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:58.640]
But in your case, he'll make an exception.

[01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:00.480]
Don't come back.

[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.420]
And if you do come back, Greg, don't come near me.

[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:04.300]
I don't want to...

[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.680]
How many times have I gone through this already?

[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:06.740]
A gazillion.

[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:08.840]
I don't want to know you.

[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:09.640]
I don't like you.

[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:10.400]
I can't stand you.

[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:11.640]
You give me the creeps.

[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:12.660]
Look in the mirror.

[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:14.100]
Look at yourself in the mirror.

[01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:14.660]
Okay, Greg?

[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:15.820]
I look at myself in the mirror.

[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:17.580]
I see a fat old balding of a fag.

[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:18.980]
And you know, I see it every day.

[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:19.540]
Don't bother me.

[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:20.620]
I'm okay.

[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.160]
But in your case, I look at you, Greg.

[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:26.140]
And I see a simple, tragic, wimpy, pathetic,

[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:28.420]
lemming and excuse for a human being

[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:30.820]
who wants me to validate your existence

[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:34.160]
as like something worthwhile by speaking to you.

[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:36.800]
By dignifying your presence there,

[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:38.320]
my table where you haven't been invited

[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.260]
and where you're absolutely unwanted.

[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:43.480]
And next time you come to my table,

[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:45.260]
I'm going to have am I good close personal friend,

[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:47.160]
Alan Cohen, who waits at Alphans even more than I do.

[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.660]
I'm going to have Alan Cohen come down

[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:50.500]
and personally pick you up with his thumb,

[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:51.700]
which he could do very easily,

[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.140]
and throw your ass right off the sixth floor of a roof.

[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:54.880]
How do you like that?

[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.980]
Greg from Boyton Beach, your ports, they lose me.

[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.480]
Wherever the hell you have and kick you out of yet.

[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:00.480]
You scumbag.

[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.840]
Oh, but jeez, I'm a part of your life.

[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.200]
Yeah, you know what, part?

[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:08.240]
The part that goes into bowl, that's the part.

[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.080]
The part that you flushed out with a tidy bowl, man.

[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:11.680]
That's the part.

[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:14.860]
God, do I hate him.

[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.060]
Well, this is a good break from that,

[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:19.960]
because here's my close personal friend, Suds.

[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.700]
You know, I hope Uncle Mikey has.

[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:25.480]
You all got, you all hold what you all got.

[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.120]
Right on his tombstone.

[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.960]
I heard he had a tattoo on his leg, those were hard.

[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:33.700]
I couldn't believe, you know, I read that in the paper this morning

[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:37.300]
about a pretty or so, and I thought, wow, jeez,

[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:38.680]
I couldn't believe it, you know.

[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:43.560]
I remember I had just moved the Naples down from Sarasota,

[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:46.860]
and I think it was his first week on WIOD.

[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:50.480]
It was him, Big Wilson, and Paul Golder,

[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:51.980]
right, the Great Entertainers, right.

[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.640]
Oh, that's a kind of a lyric.

[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.540]
King was part of that Great Entertainers too, right?

[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:55.920]
Yeah.

[01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:56.880]
Oh, yeah.

[01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:00.080]
Call her, he and Larry used to do that man on the street deals.

[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:00.280]
Right.

[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:01.800]
Oh, let me just say that.

[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:03.340]
There were the funniest things I'd ever heard.

[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:03.580]
Yeah.

[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:07.000]
And I thought, why these days, man, I'm going to work at that radio station.

[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:07.640]
Oh.

[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:10.220]
You know, I don't know, you know, it's funny you say that,

[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:13.640]
because when I was working at, um, I and Z.

[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:14.380]
Yeah.

[01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:18.000]
And I'm trying to remember the restaurant that we used to go up to there on,

[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.820]
and, uh, what the hell was the restaurant over there by IOD?

[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:22.820]
How'd they run a crossway?

[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:24.340]
Oh, that, uh, steak joint?

[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:26.020]
Well, my honor, I don't know what the hell was.

[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:28.740]
But anyway, I used to, every time I would drive by IOD,

[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:32.060]
I would think to myself, someday I'm going to be working in that building.

[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:34.880]
My psychic powers course, little did I know what was going to happen, but...

[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:35.080]
Yeah.

[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:35.680]
I knew that.

[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:36.320]
Yeah.

[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:40.500]
Well, when I remember when you, then I remember when you and Rick used to come and stand the doorway

[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:43.940]
until it turned out, and I was, and I would like walk right by and just walk out the door,

[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:45.920]
which I apologize, I apologize for that.

[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:49.260]
No, I might not have noticed that we weren't standing where we were on our knees begging.

[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:52.800]
Which paid off in a long run.

[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:55.780]
You know, that the Inron movie last night was very good.

[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:56.420]
It was excellent.

[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:57.080]
Very good.

[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.820]
Now, I'm, I'm, I'm wrong about that.

[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:02.200]
It was should times you could probably have put in the newspaper that it was going to be on Channel 33.

[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:02.920]
Oh, absolutely.

[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.720]
You know, I, I read the review he did.

[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:05.120]
Yeah.

[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:07.640]
And noticed it, uh, it said Channel 4.

[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:10.980]
And I knew a week before that that it wasn't going to be on Channel 4.

[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.680]
They put a stick and heat game on there.

[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:16.440]
And not only was it a heat game, a tape delayed heat game.

[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:16.820]
Oh, no.

[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:17.360]
Yeah.

[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.080]
Are you serious?

[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:22.880]
Oh, my God.

[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:23.020]

[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:23.920]
Oh, yeah.

[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:24.340]
Yeah, great.

[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:26.680]
Well, it's not going to run.

[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.620]
You know, I'm really busy.

[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:28.540]
Yeah.

[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:28.960]
Yeah.

[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:30.380]
Yeah, go, okay.

[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:30.780]
Go, okay.

[01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:33.560]
Spatx, uh, try to figure out how to turn on the dishwasher.

[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:34.560]
Don't spend too much.

[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:34.980]
Okay.

[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:36.520]
We'll see you.

[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.300]
Suds Coleman, what you heard from Terry Griffin.

[01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:41.660]
We were from Dave Slater and the Suds Coleman are three friends.

[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:45.720]
We don't, we hear from some other ones, but we don't have any left of the business.

[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:47.000]
They either hate us or they're dead.

[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:49.620]
One of the other isn't Chuck Meyer going to be calling in from wherever.

[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:50.340]
No.

[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:50.760]
No.

[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:51.820]
Roger.

[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.000]
Roger Magnum might call it.

[01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:56.320]
Although Roger would probably wonder what Chuck's doing these days.

[01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:58.560]
Hey, getting stoned in South Florida.

[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:04.020]
I wonder why, why are you getting not even a chuckle?

[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:04.540]
I know.

[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.280]
Why are you such a hard-ass about Chuck Meyer?

[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:08.400]
Just because he became such an egotist.

[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:09.840]
He was a brilliant guy.

[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:10.080]
Yeah.

[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.100]
A great voice.

[01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:12.160]
See, now there's another one.

[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.340]
Oh, no, no, that would be bad.

[01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:15.560]
I'm not going to put him in the same category with the other one with a good voice.

[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:17.760]
Because Chuck Meyer was a hundred times the guy.

[01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:18.560]
This loser is.

[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:21.080]
Chuck was a good guy and started blaming you for his failure.

[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.140]
Until his ego got the best of many.

[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:25.480]
Wasn't satisfied being a low-paid news guy.

[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:28.380]
He wanted to be a high-paid talk show guy, which he was not.

[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:30.060]
Actually, he was a high-paid news guy.

[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:31.360]
He was the news directory, never.

[01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:32.760]
But he, I don't think he was making a lot of money.

[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.660]
He envisioned the ad, you know, I don't, I don't big grudge you got wanting to make more money.

[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:40.360]
But that's show and then they have Mike blowing out for that.

[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:41.860]
And then to watch those numbers.

[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:44.380]
And then of course, then they're like you said to blame me for like,

[01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:46.380]
oh, well, if Neil would have just supported this show.

[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:47.080]
Yeah.

[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:50.520]
Like if I would have supported the music, I'd say that they'd had big numbers the rest of the day.

[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:52.120]
You people are in a dream world.

[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:56.980]
See, it's not good enough for management that they take my good numbers and they run to the bank with it.

[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.560]
And they help to sell the whole station with that.

[01:28:58.640 --> 01:28:59.440]
That's not good enough.

[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:04.020]
Now, I have to be able to spread my audience out over all the rest of the station to all the other shows

[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:07.040]
to listen to music that they don't like, to listen to personalities that they hate.

[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.040]
I can't do that.

[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:08.360]
Sorry.

[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:09.600]
Sorry.

[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:12.120]
You idiots.

[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.020]
Tim Williams.

[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:16.020]
Mike Disney.

[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:19.060]
Bob Neil, etc.

[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:20.680]
How's Bob Paxton doing?

[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.180]
Sure, man, he got out of radio.

[01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:24.960]
Was he ever in it?

[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.740]

[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:29.840]

[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.200]
You know the suds saw the Rene everything in the obituary column?

[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:15.940]
And when you got as much spare time as suds, you read the obituary column.

[01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:16.780]
It kills them good time.

[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:23.040]
We're supporting you at 560 WQM.

[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.740]
Yes, I am.

[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:27.160]
We got not auction coming up.

[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:27.740]
Oh boy!

[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.760]
That's where we auction off an item of great value.

[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:31.480]
You're slashing me, Mo.

[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:32.320]
Oh yeah.

[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:33.920]
They're holding it.

[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:34.640]
Okay.

[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:39.520]
Well, we got more auctioned these items off for a very, very good, good cause.

[01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:40.820]
Reach for the sky.

[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:42.140]
What's that mean?

[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:43.460]
It means stupid.

[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.840]
If they don't give up a goat, we take it anyway.

[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:48.220]
Oh, like Reach for the sky.

[01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:49.400]
Your money or your wing?

[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:51.320]
What's the matter, Mo?

[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:52.500]
I'm thinking.

[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:54.060]
Just a joke, Mo.

[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:54.900]
A joke, huh?

[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.620]
Yeah, I got a joke for you.

[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:57.800]
Now that's funny.

[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:00.820]
Now, where we got auction off this diet?

[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:02.460]
Why not auction off your paybed?

[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:04.400]
Say, that's not a bad idea.

[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:05.620]
I need to know when anyway.

[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.580]
Yeah, please.

[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.400]
But please let me tell my minions in paradise.

[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:12.780]
I'm about to look serious of a glades hotel and it's magnificent spa.

[01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:18.100]
That's where my close-place-dital-man friend Jake Feedler and I go quite often.

[01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:24.600]
He got in like two-minute-a-spire lined in naked with just the dull, steamy moisture,

[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:33.680]
aeroyntine balls, jays-soft hands, gently caressing my butt-ucks, then grasping them, drawing

[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:34.520]
me closer.

[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:36.700]
You can't carry the way, Mo.

[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:37.700]
You're squinting on me.

[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:38.360]
Stop it.

[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:39.480]
You are professional smook.

[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:41.820]
How dare you interrupt a spot.

[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.440]
But just press in me again.

[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:45.060]
How could you have splashed here?

[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:52.360]
You've been flashing me with your disparic-steed.

[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.040]
You want to see?

[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:56.280]
Squirt, Squirt?

[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:59.100]
The filthy get in my pants, clean.

[01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:02.520]
That smells like fox in his cash.

[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:06.280]
How time you got a brand new bag?

[01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:12.060]
The bag makes me feel good, isn't it?

[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:13.940]
Like an old Kaka-jut.

[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:17.500]
It feels nice.

[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:21.740]
Like when I melt the hot wax in my eyes.

[01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:24.940]
This old one here, thanks.

[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:28.320]
So I gotta get a brand new bag.

[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:31.060]
There.

[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.660]
We can splash me.

[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:33.800]
It stinks.

[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.240]
That's right.

[01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:38.700]
That's right.

[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:43.000]
14-11-560 WQM.

[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:46.720]
Not only does Tom Jikun not write anything about Reneerie Dine,

[01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:50.020]
but you remember what Tom does write that has to do with Rady on his town?

[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:52.800]
The last two columns that he wrote that I can remember.

[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:56.380]
We're both about the Dewop shop.

[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:57.200]
Oh yeah.

[01:32:57.480 --> 01:32:57.680]
Yeah.

[01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:58.620]
The Dewop shop.

[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.880]
Do you know how many people listen to Dewop beside Boca-Brine?

[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:04.020]
You could put in a phone booth the entire Dewop audience

[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:05.940]
and I remember when we left for the North Korean Army.

[01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:08.360]
How do you like that?

[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:09.440]
And Fat Boy's ass.

[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:11.900]
You could jam that in there too.

[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:15.080]
And he's writing big articles about that.

[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.960]
And all this guy got screwed over on Magic and the Dewop shop.

[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:18.820]
Yada yada yada.

[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:20.800]
That must be another New York thing, you know?

[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:21.760]
Hey, guess what, Tom?

[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:23.840]
You're not in New York anymore in case you haven't looked around.

[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.440]
Here's a call from Miami.

[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:27.700]
Hello?

[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:28.780]
Neil?

[01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:29.380]
Yes, sir.

[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:29.900]
How are you?

[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:30.260]
Good.

[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:32.120]
Long, long time listener.

[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.980]
I think I've called you twice in the last 15 years.

[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:35.320]
Okay.

[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:40.400]
You know, I've listened to you for that period of time, probably Mike Clawso.

[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:45.180]
And for years I would wonder and ask myself why I enjoyed Mike Reneerie's show.

[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.220]
And then I asked why I was so devastated by his death.

[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:52.460]
And I think it was, it was like writing in every morning with an old friend.

[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:55.360]
And when they're suddenly gone, you realize how much you miss him.

[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:55.740]
Right.

[01:33:55.740 --> 01:34:00.360]
And I tell you, he was also an inspiration as to how he kept coming back.

[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.280]
I mean, he would take his hard knocks.

[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:03.840]
He was a survivor.

[01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:07.580]
He was a survivor and he was always upbeat and cheerful.

[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:13.880]
I don't know what he was like in his personal life, but you never could tell over the year that he'd had such a hard time.

[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:15.600]
And he was an inspiration.

[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:22.140]
And, you know, what the tragedy was happening to radio now is all of these personalities,

[01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:23.760]
work in suds, micreneerie.

[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.840]
They're all passing from the scene and they're way or another.

[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:27.940]
And what are we left with?

[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:29.100]
Cookie cutter cramp.

[01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:32.320]
Yeah, if you're not a sports holder, there is nothing to listen to.

[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:36.160]
Hey, listen, I don't know how you feel about sports, but I really mean it when I turn in.

[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:37.300]
And I do enjoy sports.

[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:38.680]
I watch both football games yesterday.

[01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:40.000]
But I got to say this.

[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.000]
The George uses that term about it makes his teeth ache.

[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:47.480]
I feel the same way, listening to people dissecting ball games and carrying on,

[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.100]
getting all emotional and psychotic.

[01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:50.840]
It's one thing to be a sports fan.

[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:55.280]
It's another thing that have absolutely no life or any perspective on what's really important in the world.

[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:56.460]
I know you can take it for that.

[01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:56.820]
It's tragic.

[01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:58.860]
If you're a normal person, you can take it for 10 minutes.

[01:34:59.180 --> 01:34:59.720]
That's about it.

[01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:05.360]
But anyway, I just want to say, you know, how much your listeners value your company

[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:10.320]
and the way you've enriched our lives over the years, we felt the same way about micreneerie

[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:11.860]
suds and all the good guys on radio.

[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.580]
So keep doing what you're doing.

[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:14.440]
Thanks for the search, John.

[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:14.800]
Thank you.

[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:15.140]
Bye-bye.

[01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:17.100]
Here's a facts guess who it's from.

[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:17.880]
I give you one guess.

[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:19.220]
Oh, you don't have to ask me.

[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:21.760]
I even recognize the handwriting.

[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:26.600]
And the only reason I'm dignifying it is just to show the audience I'm not some hard-bitten old piece of crap.

[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:27.760]
Well, maybe I am.

[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:28.960]
He will be heard.

[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:29.700]
Oh, yes.

[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:30.500]
He will be heard.

[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:34.360]
And of course I could smit-can this like I do with most of this crap, like the guy with a tiny handwriting.

[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:37.260]
Neil, I saw you in the F and elevator.

[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:38.320]
It didn't say a word to you.

[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:41.960]
Now, you didn't say a word to me because you got on the elevator because that's the one I was getting on.

[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:42.840]
Who now you can?

[01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:44.600]
Lifeless piece of turd.

[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:46.220]
It says, who the hell would be?

[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:48.000]
Would you be without your radio show?

[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:56.540]
Now you see, this is a guy who just on Saturday told me how great the show's sounding and it was nice to see me again.

[01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:00.560]
But because of the fact that I hate him like poison, now I'm a piece of crap.

[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:03.780]
Just another fat old homo and sunrise lakes.

[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:04.740]
It says, who are you kidding?

[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:06.740]
I don't live in sunrise lakes, Schmuck.

[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:08.460]
And I also don't live in Port St. Lucie.

[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:11.740]
I haven't called your show over six years, which is a lie.

[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:12.860]
A lie.

[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:19.320]
I was in town for an annual meeting at Pompo-no Park and stopped by to say hello for all of 30 seconds that I was gone.

[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:19.880]
That's it.

[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:24.180]
The only reason you were gone in 30 seconds is because I kept looking down to my program and ignoring you.

[01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:27.140]
I don't want anything from you nor will I ever.

[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:29.760]
They're saying, hello once a year if I happen to see you mean I have no life.

[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:31.260]
Yes. And then I'm pathetic. Yes.

[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:34.260]
You're the one that looks pathetic. Screw off. Greg.

[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:35.780]
How do you like that?

[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:37.240]
I guess he told you.

[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:39.920]
Yeah, you told me off. I look pathetic. Right.

[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:43.100]
And you know what? What kind of card did you drive up in last night, Greg?

[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:43.620]
Huh?

[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:45.740]
And how much you pulling on this year's sweetheart?

[01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:48.880]
Plus, I wasn't there for a date last night, Greg.

[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:51.360]
How do you like them, apples? I wasn't there for a date with you.

[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:57.340]
He's just, he gives me the creeps. He makes my skin crawl.

[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:02.700]
And you'll be called the great union between him and the unmentionable one, Andy from Hollywood.

[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:03.560]
Remember that?

[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:07.060]
Well, the two of them were ganging up at the hockey games which you're up together.

[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:09.680]
Birds of a feather suck around together.

[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:12.960]
Chronic, we got to start a new organization.

[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:16.300]
It's going to be called C-A Chronic's Anonymous.

[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:22.540]
The guy with the eyes, the guy with the fanny pack, that jack guy with a big square hands.

[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:25.660]
This is a grittest loser, Andy from Hollywood.

[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:26.920]
All these guys, Woody.

[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:28.080]
Gilbert.

[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:31.100]
Gilbert, well, now you're getting carried away.

[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:38.600]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:40.660]
Here's Tamarack. Hello.

[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:45.160]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T.

[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:45.680]

[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:46.180]
What is it?

[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.180]
It's not my choice to call this radio show.

[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.780]
Good. It's my choice to go to hang up.

[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.340]
Oh, and it's going to be two in a row because this is Hi-A-Lia. Hello.

[01:37:58.320 --> 01:37:58.800]
Hello, Neil.

[01:37:58.960 --> 01:37:59.280]
Yes, sir.

[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:01.780]
A happy, belated new year, Neil.

[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:06.260]
I wanted to call you because I want to say happy new year, first of all, and secondly...

[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:07.280]
He just got to your standard, yeah.

[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.220]
Yeah, I know.

[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:12.620]
Mike Ranieri, I was on his show back in the early 90s.

[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:17.360]
I'm a local musician and they had a rock-and-roll showcase in the early 90s called Miami Rocks.

[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:21.480]
And I was on the show and I just want to say that I'm sorry that he's kind of...

[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:24.120]
He was a very nice guy, very, very accommodating.

[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.640]
He gave me a nice plug being a musician and performer.

[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:32.340]
And just, you know, I just want to go save the world of radio out there.

[01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:35.360]
There was a nice guy on the air that the guy had substance.

[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:37.660]
Okay.

[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:39.260]
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:40.380]
Neil, take care.

[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:41.760]
Okay, so you too, thank you.

[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:42.480]
Well, that was nice.

[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:46.080]
5, 6, 7, 8, of course, nice is not a word that this town knows too much about.

[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:47.300]
We don't want to be too nice.

[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:52.160]
No, we got a bunch of chronic, we got a bunch of whiners like Greg out there.

[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:53.860]
Oh, gee, you're the one that looks pathetic.

[01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:55.880]
You fat old homo should be living in sunrise lakes.

[01:38:56.540 --> 01:39:02.420]
But you see, the problem is Greg, I do have the radio show and I do put that big fat checkered

[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:06.940]
a bank airbie two weeks and I am driving my two Corvettes and I am living the life of Riley

[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:09.900]
in Toronto and here in wherever the hell I feel like it.

[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:14.120]
And you're running around like some kind of a living, schlepping up to me at the track.

[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:16.140]
Like a suckling.

[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:17.860]
Remember the ugly duckling?

[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:19.080]
This is the ugly suckling.

[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:23.340]
Not to be confused with your good friend Matt Sludge.

[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.160]
You know who he sounds like on the air?

[01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:28.020]
Have you ever heard him on the air?

[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:29.280]
No, I haven't.

[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.000]
I'll give you a clue.

[01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:32.120]
So I'm just like the sheep.

[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:32.860]
Hooked it in a way.

[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:33.120]
Oh, seriously?

[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:35.140]
He looks like he sounds like the sheep.

[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:36.220]
Corn, Neil, you need to better net.

[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:36.880]
Just like that.

[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:38.580]
Winey, whiny, right wing.

[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:39.900]
Here's the culture.

[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:40.760]
I had those liberals.

[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:42.200]
Ehh, ehh, ehh.

[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:43.080]
God.

[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:45.380]
You know, I probably never hear from Lynn Samuels again.

[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:46.280]
I love her.

[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:47.180]
She's a wonderful person.

[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.260]
But there's something, I don't know what that's all about.

[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:49.660]
Do you?

[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:51.280]
I'll never know what that's all about.

[01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:55.980]
I mean, politically there is far apart as it is possible to speak into James Carvell and the Murray Magdalene.

[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.540]
But there's, and you sure as hell know it ain't about anything else?

[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:00.860]
I don't know what that's all about.

[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:01.300]
Lynn.

[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:03.540]
Here's Sunrise.

[01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:03.880]
Hello.

[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:05.320]
Hey, Neil, what's up?

[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:05.940]
Yes, sir.

[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:07.000]
Hey, just real quick.

[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:08.540]
I was coming to the sky at him.

[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:10.860]
He wants to tell people I had some, hey, how much you make here?

[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:12.140]
He goes, why are you all new to that?

[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:13.440]
I'm like, what's up with that?

[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:15.500]
I mean, what is he going to be so offensive about that for?

[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:16.860]
That's my first point.

[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.600]
My second point is, then somebody's all going to leave.

[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:18.840]
I mean, come on, come on, come on.

[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:19.260]
Wait a minute.

[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:19.640]
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:19.740]
What?

[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:22.640]
Yeah.

[01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:24.760]
I didn't hear the last part.

[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:25.780]
I don't want to.

[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:27.200]
566705...

[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:28.040]
I think that the first part was fine.

[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:29.860]
...good, it's perfect.

[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:30.740]
It worked out great.

[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:33.520]
Would you just relax?

[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:34.400]
Just calm down.

[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:35.520]
I just wanted to make sure you know.

[01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:39.060]
Here's our close personal friend, Rick Shaw, who unfortunately has to work at a station where they play,

[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:40.720]
built me a buttercup 10 times an hour.

[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:41.220]
How are you doing, Rick?

[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:42.660]
Good, Neil.

[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:43.300]
Happy New Year.

[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:43.860]
Same to you.

[01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:44.880]
All right.

[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:46.780]
Sorry to hear about Mike.

[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:47.220]
Mike, oh my god.

[01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:52.280]
he was one of the old timers not many of us left man they're just a very few of us left that's

[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:56.760]
exactly right and and and the sad part of it is nobody's around the replacement you know nobody

[01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:03.680]
is doing it the way he did it I did it you did it and you know that it seems to be part of

[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:08.120]
something that's just kind of passing on and then going into the past no matter what

[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:11.700]
that's because you've got a government that you know has four companies on every station in the

[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:15.560]
world and all they want is put cooking cutter crap on there they don't care about personalities

[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:19.360]
you've got the same half dozen people on every station in every market in the world and that's it

[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:25.740]
yeah very sad it isn't he it's a sad time for radio and sad time obviously with Mike passing and

[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:31.740]
Mike and old just that he's and his family and all friends he really was a survivor though you

[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:35.580]
know they screwed him over there at Cox Broadcasting and then he got the last laugh on him by getting

[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:40.320]
paid off a year for not working and then he but he to his credit he put himself together the

[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:44.740]
thing over laxie he took Roger with him and Henry and you know he write right up and finally and he

[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:49.420]
made himself a living hey you know what he was a nice guy yeah really a great guy yeah

for balance for life the beast did it first how much did the beast lose over 60 pounds right

[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:55.460]

[01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:22.500]
sanctimonious gang

[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:24.300]
sourdough's right

[01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:26.560]
we radio hold

[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:28.540]
that's not the Lord of Mind

[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:30.480]
this video is a dough

[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:33.100]
psycho beach never be

[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:35.360]

[01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:37.820]
Laura's mother should know

[01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:40.220]
oh

[01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:40.380]
from the head

[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:40.380]

[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:41.800]
Laura's mother should know

[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:42.380]
oh

[01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:45.520]
from the head

[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:49.960]
on the floor

[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.780]
that's what the former said in cemetery village

[01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:54.660]
it's 11.01 at 5.60 WQAM

[01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:56.260]
on a very uh...

[01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:57.760]
I don't know, I'm kind of a marginal monday

[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:01.100]
I've got that kind of like thing hanging over us

[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:02.200]
it's like hanging over us

[01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:03.740]
we heard from Rick Shaw

[01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:06.200]
we heard from Terry Griffin our close personal friend

[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:07.420]
Dave Slater, suds Coleman

[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:09.420]
haven't heard from Henry Barrow yet

[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:13.700]
are you holding your breath?

[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:14.620]
yes

[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:17.240]
you don't think Mikey's not going to come

[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:20.200]
I mean, Henry's not going to come because he stabbed Mikey in the back there at Waxley

[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:21.880]
and took that morning show away from him

[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.580]
and chased Mikey and your close friend Roger Maggillin out of there

[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:26.340]
and forced him to go like

[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:29.440]
wasn't a cheap channel that he was working for there at the end

[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:31.860]
wasn't it in the own station to Jay and all or whatever Jay and A?

[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.020]
yes, they said

[01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:36.180]
I mean, I don't know why I asked because other than the three we got here

[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:38.100]
they won't just about every station in the universe anyway

[01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:39.300]
so why why you even ask

[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:40.700]
don't forget those cock stations

[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:42.120]
yeah, cock's a hoist

[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:45.380]
let me say it again, we're not letting them off the hook

[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:47.820]
okay, they're the ones who went to advance micrity

[01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:49.860]
put a foot in the grave, stabbed him in the back

[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:51.120]
just like Dave Lamont

[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:54.040]
and uh... PD Boulder's dad's sonny Hershey in the back

[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:55.480]
put him in an early grave

[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:57.880]
wouldn't tell him about his he doing a U.M. games

[01:47:57.880 --> 01:47:59.040]
and I'll tell you one thing

[01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:02.860]
about our good close personal friend sonny Hershey was also a great guy

[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:04.160]
not a good guy but a great guy

[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.500]
he was no Joseph Gackie

[01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:07.220]
oh my oh my

[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:09.780]
when he was voice of the hurricanes for about a hundred years

[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.960]
he may not have been the greatest play by play announcer in the world

[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:15.660]
but he was uh... he was

[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:17.960]
the hurricane people were comfortable with him

[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:19.900]
with sonny they liked him

[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:22.380]
and he certainly wasn't hysterical and psychotic

[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:23.860]
but I can't even imagine

[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:25.880]
I was telling the Carlos before the show

[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:27.220]
I can't even imagine

[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:29.780]
the kind of histoionics that were on his station

[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:31.220]
and Friday night during that broadcast

[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:33.360]
oh my oh my

[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.100]
oh my oh my

[01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:37.180]
567-0560

[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:42.160]
pound-560 on the AT and Verizon wireless line

[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:44.540]
now you remember I wasn't gonna say that would be bad

[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:45.980]
that would be very bad

[01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:48.200]
about that plane crash we do because we liked Joe personally

[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:50.940]
Joe's a good guy and people would take that out of context

[01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:52.580]
and say oh gee he wished that Joe would

[01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:54.100]
I know I don't wish anything bad

[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:56.020]
Joe is a good guy I like Joe's a gacky

[01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:57.640]
in fact you know something

[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:00.480]
I wouldn't mind if they put Joe on between nine and ten

[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:02.000]
and put us back on ten to two

[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.460]
they screwed me man I like the hours

[01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:06.220]
I made no mistake about that

[01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:08.000]
I'd be lying to you if I said I don't love nine to one

[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000]
I love getting off at one o'clock

[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.080]
but uh... they killed a show

[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:14.020]
they destroyed us ratings anyway

[01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:16.020]
another one of Greg's brain storms baby

[01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:18.500]
trying to goose up that morning show by once again

[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:20.360]
siphoning off from good old

[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:22.100]
new girl

[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:24.540]
the plan actually works little bit

[01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:27.700]
but yeah but but there's but there's siphoning from us though

[01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:31.500]
it doesn't work for us it may work for him but it don't work for us

[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:33.080]
but you know something who cares screw him

[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:35.720]
after five years of producing for them

[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:37.920]
that's for you okay Greg that's for you

[01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:39.340]
you didler

[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:42.020]
he should have been on Batman remember they had the riddler

[01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:42.940]
he could have been the didler

[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:44.800]
and I do love that show

[01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:47.680]
I've got that up there on action tv

[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:50.240]
oh that's another thing I wanted to talk about digital cable

[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:53.360]
I don't want to get you too depressed about being here in south Florida

[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:54.920]
because we are cursed down here

[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:57.340]
and one of the ways that were cursed is by AT&T

[01:49:57.340 --> 01:49:58.980]
uh... what do they call it

[01:49:58.980 --> 01:49:59.700]
broad band

[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:01.720]
AT&T AT&T Broadband

[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:04.440]
I wouldn't wish their cable on Osama bin Laden

[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:06.320]
a.l. fitler and Mussolini together

[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:07.460]
Benito Fonito

[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:10.460]
that's digital cable my ass

[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:12.500]
up in Toronto I got Rogers digital cable

[01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:13.200]
my own company

[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:15.260]
with a thousand channels

[01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:18.160]
I'm not saying they all come in but there are hundreds of channels

[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:20.200]
including all those great movie channels I told you about

[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:22.920]
and maybe I haven't told you about including the action tv ones

[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:25.460]
where they got shows like Batman on two three times a day

[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:28.520]
like they have back between four and five back to back half hour episodes

[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:29.400]
of the old Batman

[01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:32.040]
where Robbins got something stuff in his pants

[01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:34.180]
great stuff

[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:37.220]
that's one of the other reasons I get so depressed about being down here

[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:39.520]
even just what you watch on tv the choices are pathetic

[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:41.200]
when suds told me that that game

[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.580]
the heat game last night was on tape delay

[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:45.580]
that has got to be criminal

[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:47.800]
you people are channel four need a lobotomy

[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:48.800]
you're crazy people

[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:51.360]
we should know that when they put Angela Ray back on here

[01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:53.620]
but cackler

[01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:56.040]
any minute now she's gonna fall backwards in her chair

[01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:57.960]
no any minute now she's gonna lay a gigantic egg

[01:50:57.960 --> 01:50:59.920]
the size of my rush more in its here

[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:01.700]
a huge one

[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:03.900]
and they sure laid an egg with everybody else last night

[01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:05.140]
really

[01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:08.720]
and not only was it a good movie but it was an important movie

[01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:10.140]
the enron flick

[01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:11.160]
it was it was well done

[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:13.140]
even jicolike there was hidden like anything

[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:17.860]
and how many people do you think

[01:51:17.860 --> 01:51:19.540]
knew it was on channel 33

[01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:22.700]
about five

[01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:24.660]
you people are channel four man

[01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:27.060]
you make me sick you make me want a puke you suck

[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:30.360]
god there's an awful lot of sucking going on in this town

[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:32.740]
that's why the people are making maybe that's why so many people are here

[01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:33.740]
so ornary you know

[01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:35.940]
maybe they actually be nice people

[01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:38.000]
if there was like more nice stuff going on around them

[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.740]
as opposed to like AT&T broadband

[01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:41.380]
came where the signal blows

[01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:43.460]
there isn't a day that goes by

[01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:44.140]
that like

[01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:47.620]
the channels like kind of like fade out for a second

[01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:48.760]
then they come back on

[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:51.560]
see at CNN forget about it's been like

[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:53.900]
it's got a shadow of the station

[01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:54.800]
and real loud

[01:51:55.340 --> 01:51:57.220]
like that for days now

[01:51:57.220 --> 01:51:58.420]
once in a while it comes in okay

[01:51:58.420 --> 01:51:59.660]
so I go to direct TV

[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:01.760]
if I want to watch CNN

[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:04.280]
or one of my other 40 satellite dishes

[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:08.460]
here's Fort Lauderdale hello

[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:10.160]
hey Neil

[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:11.960]
yes sir hey my name is Eric

[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:14.120]
I was a microneer he's

[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:15.960]
bored out for the last three years

[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:17.340]
up in Palm Beach where he was

[01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:20.060]
and I was just listening to all the things he had to say

[01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:23.900]
and you're absolutely right the one thing that stood out about the guy was he was just a regular

[01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:27.400]
good guy he never has like a head trip going on

[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:30.740]
or any power trips he was always easy to work with

[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:32.740]
the first day I walked in there I asked him

[01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:36.360]
what are we going to do how we going to run this show he said just get me on the air

[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:37.460]
son and I'll do the rest

[01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:41.020]
that's right and he said just pot of my mic and make it happen

[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:43.880]
and from that day on in the next three years you know

[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:46.400]
they were full of fun and he was you know

[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:49.440]
unexpected turns at every corner with mic but uh

[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:52.360]
well one of the great things about mic is he could make more out of

[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:55.400]
less than anybody I ever knew he could make a show out of the

[01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:58.720]
Almanac and the weather report and then make a whole show out of it was amazing

[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:00.620]
well and the fishing report

[01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:04.140]
we're seeing his show prep every day that was about it

[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:07.840]
and he'd come on in and he'd just make it happen and be mic

[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:11.180]
and uh always nice always happy and uh

[01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:16.040]
never a problem and uh it was really fun working with him and uh he'll be missed

[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:18.180]
guys like him and you that's uh

[01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:20.440]
that shows you he's passed away

[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:23.460]
and we have more Howard so I guess that tells you where we're at

[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:25.220]
what does that tell you we're going to hell on a hand basket

[01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:26.980]
thanks Eric thanks Eric

[01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:30.440]
here's a fact from Mike the chronic who just can't help himself

[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:32.540]
it must be the overhead because

[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:35.280]
or maybe I've been shouting a lot today I've been shouting and screaming

[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:36.180]
and screaming and screaming outside

[01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:39.620]
little bombastic because I'm getting like a raw throat

[01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:42.260]
I think I'm going to be out sick for a few weeks I've got a sore but tall

[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:44.820]
probably till March I'll take one of those

[01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:47.960]
during the I'll come and get during the break because I don't want you to have to take that headset off

[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:49.240]
it's so cumbersome

[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:52.460]
Mike the chronic says I just logged out the QM's website

[01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:54.040]
and saw a picture of Moe Howard David

[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:56.680]
that is one ugly Moe foe he says

[01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:00.140]
no one reason out on camera he chatted the lens

[01:54:00.140 --> 01:54:02.360]
and he calls you ginger release ginger with someone attractive

[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:04.720]
all the best no he actually calls me Neo Rodgers now

[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:05.600]
and you know what two late

[01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:07.000]
two late

[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:10.720]
it would be like if OJ called up the goldmins

[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:13.180]
and says oh come on let's go to dinner this weekend I'm buying

[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:13.680]
you know

[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:17.180]
I just somehow I don't think they'd be too receptive

[01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:20.420]
and so if that's supposed to be his overture or his

[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:23.120]
his posture is being professional or whatever

[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:24.500]
whatever he's doing for the new year

[01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:26.640]
way too late you know

[01:54:28.060 --> 01:54:30.420]
be like Hitler showing up at a synagogue some

[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:33.860]
Friday evening and saying you know maybe I maybe I was a little bit

[01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:42.640]
went overboard my bad yeah right so did I mention I did mention about the same thing about it the movie The Austin Powers I saw Gold finger

[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:46.580]
Goldmins anything about it exactly Goldmimmer it was good it was okay the skin

[01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:49.720]
I like the skin it was wearing off a little bit

[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:52.060]
the mole that was funny yeah

[01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:57.980]
you're right it was pretty good well it's the kind of movie though that's great

[01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:01.980]
for killing time on a plane oh yeah because usually the movies you have a choice from on a plane are like

[01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:06.180]
oh so margital you know but that's kind of like a first run movie it's good stuff

[01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:08.440]
so I loved it

[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:14.140]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line

[01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:18.280]
which the best FM station in South Florida is our pool today also if you go to Neo Rodgers

[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:22.120]
dot com great job by the way Eric and Sputter what they're saying about you now they're not saying anything

[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:27.260]
just I don't want to get him worked up again okay that's my mistake we love you Eric okay

[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:34.340]
even though you're a little slow sometimes I don't I don't want to start kissing is asked too much

[01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:40.000]
because they'll think like you know I want to keep them on his toes and of course keeping Eric on his toes and be like anyway

[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:46.060]
the book David Brock blinded by the right the conscience of an ex conservative this is our new book that we recommend

[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:49.380]
enthusiastically I'm a little late getting around with this because suds gave me this book two months ago

[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:56.660]
but it just came out last year anyway so it's a here's a guy that was originally a liberal when he went off to Berkeley he became a conservative

[01:55:56.660 --> 01:56:01.760]
a rich in the book he'll explain to you how that happened a rabid hateful right-winger which I guess is being redundant

[01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:09.380]
and then finally uh fast up to all of it and the book is fascinating it's sensational including what he points out about Ms. Grudge

[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:13.520]
you mark my words there won't be no emails from my friend Lynn anymore

[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:20.640]
I went over the edge over the board on Ms. Grudge maybe they share the same wardrobe I don't know

[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:29.520]
why in local we're sports radio 560 she went to a yeah oh god

11.16 is 5.60 WQM, happy Monday, 2.

[01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:26.060]
The NeoRodger Show is still kicking ass after 600 years.

[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:26.760]
How do you like that?

[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:28.380]
Kicking Greg's ass right out of our face.

[01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:30.320]
What is it about that name?

[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:31.700]
Do we know any Greg that we like?

[01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:33.580]
Think about it.

[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:34.140]
I make love.

[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:35.780]
Greg Lusannis?

[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:36.660]
I don't know him.

[01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:38.680]
I don't know any Greg.

[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:40.540]
We know Greg Reed and we know Greg from...

[01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:41.040]
Greg Fade it.

[01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:41.460]
From Hunger?

[01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:43.100]
Oh yeah, Greg Fade it.

[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:44.500]
He's a good guy from WYOD.

[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:45.380]
We're not what he's doing.

[01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:46.460]
He's standing over there.

[01:58:46.700 --> 01:58:48.120]
He's just seen those flenigin spots.

[01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:49.720]
Yeah, that's him.

[01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:52.160]
Well, he must have balls like an elephant, you know what?

[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:53.300]
This is the Wizky.

[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:54.280]
This is the Wizky.

[01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:55.060]
Is that what it is?

[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:55.380]
Yes.

[01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:57.220]
So Henry Barrow hasn't called yet.

[01:58:57.740 --> 01:58:59.880]
I'm gonna keep mentioning that until we embarrass him to call him.

[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:00.360]
He won't.

[01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:03.120]
He won't be calling in either with that bolt-headed Mark Benson.

[01:59:03.500 --> 01:59:05.800]
Mark is still busy running around trying to force people to speak English.

[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:07.640]
Even if they don't want to.

[01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:09.900]
See, you don't know some of these crap.

[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:10.940]
I like I know, man.

[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:12.520]
You don't know, like I know them,

[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:14.700]
because I've been here a long time, baby.

[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:15.740]
I don't know them at all.

[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:18.560]
And the one thing about this town, it's like recycled Schmidt.

[01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:22.080]
They just keep popping up over and over and over again.

[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:23.440]
Never go away.

[01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:25.660]
Here's the fact that says,

[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:27.880]
you are absolutely correct, sir.

[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:28.680]
The radio sucks.

[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:30.400]
Except for you and Steer,

[01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:31.520]
and there isn't Schmidt to listen to,

[01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:33.160]
or should I say there is Schmidt to listen to?

[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:36.720]
Nothing but the same repetitive swill over and over day and end day out.

[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:39.380]
And it's been that way for at least 20 years.

[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:41.500]
It's amazing how much great music exists,

[01:59:41.820 --> 01:59:43.040]
and yet none of it has ever played.

[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:45.560]
I traveled two hours a day,

[01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:47.140]
commuting to work and have become so desperate.

[01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:48.920]
I listen to sports geeks like mad dog,

[01:59:49.020 --> 01:59:50.220]
moron and fat slob hammer.

[01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:51.580]
Come on, don't be picking on Hank.

[01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:54.420]
Because he's really a bit on the puddy side, okay?

[01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:55.060]
That was fun.

[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:56.040]
He says it's pathetic.

[01:59:57.580 --> 01:59:59.940]
I urge all four meetings to call these stations

[01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:01.240]
and bitch about the programming.

[02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:04.360]
Then station management might get off the race

[02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:05.360]
and change the entire format,

[02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:06.300]
but I doubt it.

[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:07.420]
PS floor to sucks.

[02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:09.460]
Well, doubting it is the correct way to look at it.

[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:10.180]
Okay, don't waste your time.

[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:11.860]
Stick with your CDs and whatever else.

[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:14.840]
Just like all those classical music people,

[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:15.520]
I keep telling you,

[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:17.520]
they'll have those amazing things called CDs.

[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:23.080]
Wining and crying and catching and carrying on about nothing.

[02:00:24.100 --> 02:00:25.800]
Every great piece of classical music

[02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:29.740]
is available on beautiful digital quality CD.

[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:32.120]
Just pop it right in your player in your,

[02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:33.700]
in your lectures in your Mercedes

[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:35.780]
in your Ju-Knu, whatever you're driving out there

[02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:37.560]
and quit belly aching so much.

[02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:39.880]
Oh, Jimbo, what are we gonna do?

[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:42.200]
The worst call in the history of the human race

[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:42.880]
was that call.

[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:45.700]
Even Transcendent of the guy who said,

[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:47.540]
aren't we blessed down here, Jim?

[02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:49.940]
About a couple of football games.

[02:00:50.060 --> 02:00:51.360]
Well, if we were blessed that weekend,

[02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:53.380]
well, we must be cursed something fierce.

[02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:55.080]
The devil must be sticking in our,

[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:55.780]
back to man.

[02:00:56.640 --> 02:00:58.320]
We're getting pitch-folked is what we're getting.

[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:01.740]
If it's all, if the barometer is all based on ball games.

[02:01:03.740 --> 02:01:06.580]
See, if that, and I also heard another call to Mad Dog on Friday.

[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:07.720]
Some guy talking about, well,

[02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:08.900]
you know what, it's really all about

[02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:11.500]
is my guys kick your guys, my town's better in your town.

[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:13.140]
Is that what makes a great town

[02:01:13.140 --> 02:01:15.000]
is having a sports team that wins something?

[02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:15.760]
What else?

[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:17.340]
Oh, yeah, that's a good point.

[02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:19.960]
I thought maybe if we have more early bird dinners

[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:21.840]
than everybody else, that would be nice,

[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:22.480]
but not as important.

[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:23.380]
More illegal aliens.

[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:27.180]
5, 6, 7, 0, and you notice,

[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:29.680]
you notice that last kid that washed up on short,

[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:31.480]
remember that there was never heard another word about it.

[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:33.200]
You want more kids, there was no custody battle, right?

[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:35.740]
So that was the end of that, took all the phone out of it.

[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:37.420]
I was planning for like another two years

[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:38.480]
with another alien on deal.

[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:40.480]
All a great bitch could have the phones lit up

[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:42.000]
and all those people that will never hear from again.

[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:44.880]
Remember all those hooliettes that were actually calling

[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:45.880]
old ones even?

[02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:46.480]
Oh, okay.

[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:48.080]
I think your mama called in.

[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:50.020]
Bada, bada, bada, bada, bada, bada, bada, bada.

[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:51.940]
Yeah, I don't listen to English radio.

[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.100]
Good for her, okay, no, good for us actually.

[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:55.820]
Who wants that old bitch calling us?

[02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:58.580]
And by the way, George says he don't want you calling him either.

[02:01:58.900 --> 02:01:59.440]
Not at the house.

[02:01:59.640 --> 02:01:59.960]
Your mama.

[02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:01.960]
Call him in a phone booth, okay?

[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:02.580]
He'll give you the number.

[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:06.080]
5, 6, 7, he won't be there with the phone rings,

[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:07.220]
but he'll give you the number anyway.

[02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:07.820]
Give it a shot.

[02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:10.720]
Maybe we can give the same number to Greg from 100.

[02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:15.440]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the ATT.

[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:18.400]
I will be at the Panthers Red Wing game this Wednesday night, Greg.

[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:20.520]
I just mentioned that in case maybe you would any want to stop by.

[02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:23.000]
Here is Boca, hello.

[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:24.060]
Hey, Neil.

[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:24.580]
Yes, sir.

[02:02:24.860 --> 02:02:25.300]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:25.780]
Okay.

[02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:27.240]
I hope you have a great year this year.

[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:28.880]
I've been listening to you about a year and a half.

[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:31.460]
I've been down here a few years and every time I get a chance

[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:32.280]
I'll listen to you show.

[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:34.180]
Thank God for always getting a laugh out of it.

[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:34.480]
All right.

[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:37.920]
And it really makes me feel good.

[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:41.780]
But I was living up in Canada for a few years and you're right.

[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:43.600]
They have kind of a hang up about Americans,

[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:46.880]
you know, the inferiority conference or something.

[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:47.820]
They worry about the way they live.

[02:02:47.820 --> 02:02:49.760]
I know something now that they lost, you know, the Canadian,

[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:52.020]
the junior hockey tour, the world junior hockey

[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:53.660]
that they lost to Russia last night, the final.

[02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:55.060]
They're going to be psychotic now.

[02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:56.000]
They're going to be committing suicide.

[02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:56.560]
I know.

[02:02:56.840 --> 02:02:58.400]
But they have a great country.

[02:02:58.540 --> 02:02:59.740]
But they don't, you know, they did it.

[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:02.280]
You know, they have this feeling about we should worry about them.

[02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:03.780]
We don't ever think about, you know,

[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:05.120]
the people down here never think about it.

[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:05.300]
Right.

[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:07.660]
Most of the people here don't even know where it is on the map.

[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:09.820]
Hey, could you do me one favor anything you like?

[02:03:10.620 --> 02:03:12.800]
Uncle Remus is a rendition of Condoleezza.

[02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:15.040]
If you get a chance, I love that ball.

[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:16.100]
OK, have a great day.

[02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:16.540]
Thanks, five.

[02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:20.100]
Oh, what a wonderful day.

[02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:22.540]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:24.440]
Pound 5, 60.

[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:26.940]
Before we play that though, I might have to talk to my good friend.

[02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:27.700]
Oh, I know.

[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:29.820]
And see what he thinks about it.

[02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:33.860]
Pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:36.160]
There are plenty of open lines there, which I can't understand.

[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:39.220]
It's our first full day back official after the new year,

[02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:40.600]
even though I was here Thursday and Friday.

[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:43.640]
And I know a lot of you are trying to put your life back together.

[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:44.960]
That's the excuse.

[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:45.980]
Now they're going to excuse.

[02:03:48.940 --> 02:03:50.420]
104, oh, it's just changed again.

[02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:52.100]
147.

[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:54.900]
The best FM state in South Florida, they all suck.

[02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:57.580]
147, which is more, I'm sure, than all of this put together.

[02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:01.200]
LRN 21, big 17, magic 15,

[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:03.640]
and spite of the foundations that build my S buttercup.

[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:07.540]
Zeta 10, EDR 9, Kisnana, way down from there.

[02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:10.020]
Wouldn't you think RMF would do better than that?

[02:04:11.700 --> 02:04:12.060]
No.

[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:13.440]
Why not?

[02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:15.800]
They got a great signal.

[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:17.140]
They don't get it?

[02:04:17.580 --> 02:04:18.120]
Nothing, dude.

[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:19.800]
Oh, it's kind of like the show. They don't get it.

[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:22.880]
Like our management, they just don't get it.

[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:25.040]
Oh, Scrooan's birthday is this week.

[02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:26.740]
You know what? He still smells the same.

[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:29.920]
That's what Troy told me this morning.

[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:32.280]
He said it may be her birthday, but it still smells the same.

[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:33.500]
I don't want to say what he's talking about.

[02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:39.920]
56670560, £560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:42.020]
Here's Pompato Beach, hello.

[02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:44.780]
Oh, my God. I can't talk in line for the same time.

[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:47.040]
Still cracking up about the Greg Lusainis line.

[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:48.380]
You are unbelievable.

[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:54.940]
Is there any newspaper in the country where the worst radio TV department in the Sun sentinel?

[02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:55.160]
No.

[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:59.480]
Two weeks ago, the Sunday TV book that came in yesterday's paper,

[02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:03.900]
and if people know the industry, they know that the TV book is printed two weeks in advance,

[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:08.020]
had it correct, which is the obvious because the TV book is usually raw,

[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:11.460]
but they had the heat game on Channel 4 and the end run movie on 33.

[02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:14.140]
So I don't know how Jic could didn't understand that,

[02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:16.320]
because it's in the freaking paper.

[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:17.480]
He's an asshole.

[02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:18.560]
Unbelievable, man.

[02:05:19.580 --> 02:05:21.620]
I wasn't going to talk because I heard you come at this morning about

[02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:25.160]
don't have a work and radio because sooner or later somebody is going to screw with your life.

[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:25.640]
That's right.

[02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:28.400]
And I got about 20 years experience in that, but I have to discuss,

[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:30.520]
I know you love direct television.

[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:32.200]
And I was happy.

[02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:34.660]
I last I moved to a high rise in Waterdale by the sea.

[02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:36.580]
That's why it only for direct TV.

[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:39.280]
I had it with cable companies.

[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:40.320]
I'm moving next to you.

[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:41.020]
Wait a minute.

[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:42.420]
Why do you say I love direct TV?

[02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:43.320]
I don't love direct TV.

[02:05:43.380 --> 02:05:44.400]
I was always raved about it.

[02:05:44.740 --> 02:05:45.060]
Why me?

[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:46.100]
Is it better than cable?

[02:05:46.580 --> 02:05:51.360]
Well, I have friends and relatives with AP and P digital broadband who rave about it.

[02:05:51.420 --> 02:05:53.760]
And the point is, when there's a freaking little rainstorm,

[02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:55.380]
it doesn't go out all the time.

[02:05:55.380 --> 02:05:56.620]
And I don't know.

[02:05:56.860 --> 02:06:02.900]
I had six months of nightmare between June and October with direct TV on a technical basis,

[02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:04.440]
on a customer service basis.

[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:07.240]
Their customer service department is useless.

[02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:10.960]
I wrote about full letters to the president of the right TV.

[02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:11.800]
I won't mention names.

[02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:13.120]
You know who I'm talking about.

[02:06:13.220 --> 02:06:13.540]
I'm sure.

[02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:17.640]
In Los Angeles, I get a response from somebody with a name of Kathy S.

[02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:19.340]
No less name, just the initial S.

[02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:20.220]
Yes, thanks for coming.

[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:23.180]
A corporate stationary with just a PO box.

[02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:25.680]
I still don't know where the doping is in Los Angeles.

[02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:26.940]
You can't get a phone number.

[02:06:27.020 --> 02:06:28.320]
You can't get anything accomplished.

[02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:31.880]
I had out of sync audio on the new stations.

[02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:34.180]
I had showtime, which was inaudible.

[02:06:34.940 --> 02:06:38.120]
Well, well, but you're obviously dealing with somebody incompetent.

[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:39.040]
I don't have those problems.

[02:06:39.380 --> 02:06:42.340]
Well, I mean, I did have some other problems, which I talked about last week,

[02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:43.660]
which I don't want to repeat all over again.

[02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:43.940]
Right.

[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:46.960]
But generally speaking, I have very little problem with direct TV.

[02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:52.020]
And certainly, I have 50 times the problem with a cable that I'll ever have on direct TV.

[02:06:52.020 --> 02:06:53.060]
My cable sucks.

[02:06:53.620 --> 02:06:54.380]
The only advantage...

[02:06:54.380 --> 02:06:58.540]
The cable sucks, 80-80, 80-80, broadband, they're the anti-Christ.

[02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:00.460]
Regular cable does suck.

[02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:01.240]
I agree with you.

[02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:05.920]
But they're peddling it as digital cable, and it's not digital cable.

[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:09.040]
But the only thing I'm saying you should get the same...

[02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:11.600]
At this point, at least you can get the same programming choices.

[02:07:11.860 --> 02:07:14.640]
You can get your 7HBOs, you can get your sports packages,

[02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:18.220]
and you don't have to deal with the weather problems that you get with satellite.

[02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:24.480]
I don't know, because I never had direct TV satellites as the more the dish network in a private house.

[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:27.280]
I do know some people that have gotten rid of it.

[02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:30.340]
Mainly because they're custom-made service support.

[02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:31.340]
You can't get anything done.

[02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:34.780]
We can go down the block to their offices and scream in the elevator.

[02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:39.340]
They must pay people like 50 cents an hour, because if you ever call 1-800-Direct TV,

[02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:43.240]
the people that you talk to have an IQ in a minus column.

[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:43.760]
Exactly.

[02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:47.320]
And they send me a letter back from their corporate office,

[02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:50.600]
and I told you this, and you said, well, the people that you're complaining about

[02:07:50.600 --> 02:07:52.060]
are not the right people to talk to.

[02:07:52.220 --> 02:07:55.620]
Well, if they're not giving me a phone number, tell me who I'm supposed to talk to.

[02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:58.880]
If those aren't the right people, that's the only number you're giving me.

[02:07:58.960 --> 02:07:59.960]
What am I supposed to do?

[02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:01.100]
They just come down a little bit.

[02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:03.820]
It's not worth it to get this hysterical.

[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:04.320]
I'm sorry.

[02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:05.300]
Just do it.

[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:06.500]
I'm doing it for the show.

[02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:07.180]
Oh, good.

[02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:09.380]
Like I said.

[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:10.920]
Okay, you two.

[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:13.840]
There's a kind of caller we like.

[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:15.780]
He doesn't really feel all that emotional about it,

[02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:17.400]
but he's putting on a little stick for us.

[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:17.980]
We like it, sir.

[02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:18.540]
Stick it.

[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:19.920]
Good guy.

[02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:21.980]
He's not going to sit back and take crap.

[02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:25.860]
He's paying for a quality product there, and they're jerking them around a little bit.

[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:29.180]
There's nothing wrong with a little jerking around, but it's supposed to feel good when it's over.

[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:31.180]
Here's the facts.

[02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:32.780]
You want like this from Gary.

[02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:35.220]
Another chronic.

[02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:36.800]
Same old stuff.

[02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:38.540]
This is probably a obvious boyfriend.

[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:41.860]
Says, why doesn't George talk about Palestine anymore?

[02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:43.580]
Did he get his ball circumcised?

[02:08:44.100 --> 02:08:46.000]
I didn't know they circumcised your balls.

[02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:48.520]
Do they circumcise your balls?

[02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:49.100]
Who?

[02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:50.180]
They.

[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:52.340]
Who are the brisk people?

[02:08:53.540 --> 02:08:54.980]
The people doing the brisk business.

[02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:56.220]
They circumcise your balls?

[02:08:58.340 --> 02:09:01.040]
We got people working with shave their balls like Joe Castello.

[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:04.920]
I wonder if he shaved this balls before their honeymoon since they've been living together for years now.

[02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:05.800]
He better have.

[02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:06.480]
Why?

[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:09.740]
If you're going to shave on any day, it better be through your life.

[02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:10.340]
No, it is.

[02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:11.600]
So, Janina, she into that.

[02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:13.220]
It was just his prior girlfriend.

[02:09:13.340 --> 02:09:13.680]
You know, we never.

[02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:14.980]
Never.

[02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:15.160]

[02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:15.620]
I know.

[02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:16.440]
Why don't you talk.

[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:18.840]
You always tell me that all you talk about would Joe is sex.

[02:09:19.340 --> 02:09:20.380]
You have it not with Janina.

[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:23.480]
Oh, the other babes.

[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:29.100]
Dave and Atlanta says, listening online in Atlanta, Joja, I heard you talking about Mike.

[02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:32.760]
I listened to both of you for a hundred years before fleeing that crap hole in 1996.

[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:34.640]
Congratulations Dave, you're getting out of here.

[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:39.000]
One of Mike's talents was doing a four hour show in two hours by saying everything twice.

[02:09:40.060 --> 02:09:41.060]
That's the skinny on that.

[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:42.740]
You're right Dave, we used to joke about that.

[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:47.180]
He used to do a four hour show that was really only two hours because he'd repeat everything a second time.

[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:48.640]
He'd repeat everything a second time.

[02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:51.680]
You know what things to say happen?

[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:53.920]
One thing he did not say a second time, it was UGA Buga.

[02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:55.780]
Well, that's what the Buga is.

[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:56.680]
Oh, I see.

[02:09:56.880 --> 02:09:58.280]
I used slight variation of UGA.

[02:09:58.620 --> 02:09:59.060]
Here's one.

[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:02.140]
It says, I was on a wonderful two and a half week vacation when I returned.

[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:06.300]
Sunday in red, the letter to the editor below.

[02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:09.380]
I knew it was back in South Florida, a mindless, lifeless sports hole.

[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:12.680]
This is from a Robert and Carl Springs wrote the letter that they're referring to,

[02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:14.700]
which they have on this thing on the effects.

[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:18.960]
It says, great games invariably mean the home team lost.

[02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:20.440]
Oh, I already read this. That's right.

[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:23.060]
You know something?

[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:26.500]
This, whoever faxed this to me, thank you so much Lauren.

[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:29.440]
Because I meant to cut this out, I forgot to clip it out.

[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:31.320]
Listen to this.

[02:10:31.940 --> 02:10:34.160]
Great games invariably mean the home team lost.

[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:36.040]
If they won, you wouldn't need to call it anything.

[02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:40.800]
Our season with all of it entails such as tailgating, cheering and drinking has ceased to be.

[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:43.480]
And that is the destiny of the South Florida sports fan.

[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:48.200]
The heat, Marlon's, Panthers and Dolphins offer the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat,

[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:49.120]
only more of the latter.

[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:52.200]
This was our first year of Dolphins season tickets and it was a hoot.

[02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:57.560]
Arriving three hours before game time and sharing that time with fans of all ages and heritages is enlightening.

[02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:00.680]
That we all share the dream of the ultimate test of Super Bowl,

[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:06.500]
makes us of one spirit and that spirit is hope and hope is cheap at $37 a seat plus parking.

[02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:11.400]
Hope at the heat games cost me $80 a seat plus parking and I can't cook my own stakes.

[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:16.940]
My thanks to Dolphins for a great year in the escape it had afforded for those eight game days a season

[02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:20.020]
that could dispense with the rest of the paper to just concentrate on the sports.

[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:24.680]
I could forget about the wars and meanness and cruelty and retreat to this game of giants,

[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:26.660]
rich giants, but giants nonetheless.

[02:11:27.020 --> 02:11:28.960]
By the way, how do you like the way that giants blew that game yesterday?

[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:30.320]
24-4 Leeth.

[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:34.400]
Rich giants, but giants nonetheless, and ones who share their joint disappointment with their fans,

[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:40.080]
when I fail at work it's between a law sale and me, when they fail at work there's no rationalizing on the way back to the office,

[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:41.680]
but there are cheers next time.

[02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:43.500]
See you next home game and thanks.

[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:45.440]
Right, lifeless Robert and Coral Springs.

[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:47.420]
Robert, get a life, get a search party baby.

[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:48.420]
I have no life.

[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:49.400]
Oh my god!

[02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:54.620]
I read the letter my reaction was exactly the same as the guy who faxed it to me.

[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:56.860]
You have to be schmitten me.

[02:11:58.300 --> 02:12:04.000]
These rich giants who can't afford it, you don't want to share the dream?

[02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:10.640]
I call it share the nightmares what I call especially after this last weekend when we found out that we were cursed after the last few days,

[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:17.260]
starting last Sunday, starting as a, yeah, and you know something that often fans out of feel a little bit better?

[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:20.700]
Because they only blew an 11 point lead with 5 minutes to play.

[02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:27.840]
The Browns blew a 14 point lead twice, and the giants blew a 24 point lead with about 4 seconds to play.

[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:29.940]
How do you like that?

[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:31.260]
Fat Rich Garcia?

[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:33.480]
Man, oh man.

[02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:36.180]
So what are you bitching about, huh?

[02:12:36.820 --> 02:12:39.780]
And then the Heracun's and the bad call and it was a fandom flag.

[02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:40.700]
So who cares?

[02:12:41.020 --> 02:12:43.020]
They get their own fandom call later in the game.

[02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:45.240]
They got first and go on a two yard line.

[02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:48.320]
First of all, the whole thing in college over time is ridiculous.

[02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:50.560]
Do you know how they play overtime in college?

[02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:51.340]
Have no idea.

[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:54.420]
Now you do know it overtime like in professional football.

[02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:56.260]
They go out there and they play another period.

[02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:01.200]
Just like they play the first four, well in college football they've got this great idea.

[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:07.720]
And they have the coin toss who's going to receive who's going to kick and they start with or they don't kick.

[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:08.740]
I'm sorry, they don't do that.

[02:13:08.860 --> 02:13:09.660]
Who's going to defend where?

[02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:12.140]
They start on the other teams 25 yard line.

[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:17.000]
And then they have four downs or whatever they keep trying to get a first down and they try to score.

[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.400]
If they get a field goal, they got three points.

[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:19.860]
They get a touchdown, seven points, they did nothing.

[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:22.760]
And then the other team does the same thing at the other end, 25 yard line.

[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:27.960]
And if they both get a touchdown for example, then they have a second overtime, which is what happened on the game Friday.

[02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:33.980]
So the Heracun's got the ball first and go on a two yard line and they can't punch it in.

[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:36.780]
You got nobody to belly ache about by yourselves plus the five turnovers.

[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:40.700]
And you should have known it was common.

[02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:42.280]
The game against Rutgers.

[02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:44.240]
It was like holding up a sign saying, hey, where were we?

[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:47.260]
See, this is what happens when you play girls teams all year long.

[02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:50.100]
No matter how good you are, it's like a racehorse.

[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:54.780]
If a race races against crappy competition, they tend to be lazy.

[02:13:55.180 --> 02:13:56.840]
They tend not to perform at their best.

[02:13:57.180 --> 02:14:03.020]
And then when the true test comes along, it's very easy to go back and fall back into your bad ways.

[02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:07.020]
Follow what I'm saying, because I sure don't.

[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:08.480]
Huh?

[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:10.620]
No, seriously, that's the way it works.

[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:14.740]
When you're playing all those girls teams, those big east teams, you win by 85 points.

[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:16.820]
And then all of a sudden you don't win by all those points.

[02:14:16.820 --> 02:14:19.040]
And some of the games you say, ah, maybe we stink, you know.

[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:20.720]
Maybe we suck.

[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:22.620]
Maybe we're a bunch of choking dogs.

[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:26.440]
And by the way, it was punks in Columbus.

[02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:28.820]
We already had one online that George unfortunately put online.

[02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:32.380]
I knocked him right off of there and we're not going to talk to you idiots up there.

[02:14:32.780 --> 02:14:33.740]
Get a life Columbus.

[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:35.880]
That's what Isabella told me. That's why he took off.

[02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:37.640]
You idiot.

[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:40.000]
Go to call here.

[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:41.480]
Oh, well, we kick you right out.

[02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:44.840]
Congratulations to Ohio State for at least not bringing the city down again this time.

[02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:45.300]
Nice going.

[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:47.840]
That's about the only thing we can say for you.

[02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:50.000]
Let me tell you right now, because I don't want to get sports intensive.

[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:54.440]
If USC would have played either one of those teams for today, they would have kicked their ass from here to Uranus.

[02:14:55.380 --> 02:14:57.440]
That is not, there's no debate about that.

[02:14:57.880 --> 02:14:58.760]
They'd have kicked their ass.

[02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:05.920]
We got a hundred open lines at this phone and I have no idea why, because we've heard from some very famous people today.

[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:07.180]
And some like kind of marginal.

[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:14.780]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:15:15.300 --> 02:15:16.580]
Am I doing the right spot here?

[02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:17.760]
Dial.

[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:18.800]
Oh.

[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:19.620]
And actress?

[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:19.940]
Yeah.

[02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:24.820]
Because I don't like this copy at all. I hate to copy.

[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:25.920]
Fatboy sucks.

[02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:28.500]
But he has lost 15 pounds and balance for life.

[02:15:28.540 --> 02:15:28.780]
Oh!

[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:32.880]
Anyway, if you want to get you a great night's sleep, do the same thing that I've been doing in McGail and Georgian.

[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:33.760]
Anybody else with a brain?

[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:34.660]
Even like a little one.

[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:40.300]
And get you a great brand new name brand mattress, an unbeatable price from Dial.Matrus.

[02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:45.640]

[02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:24.160]
Call 1-800-MATTRES.

[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:28.660]
That's 1-800-Matrus for Dial.Matrus, the perfect way to start off the new year.

[02:16:28.820 --> 02:16:32.820]
My, my, and local, this is 4.0-560.

[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:35.040]
Way to A.M.

[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:35.700]
But not the...

[02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:46.840]
Andolilla, andolilla, different ways.

[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:53.680]
And with your fucking yellow teeth so far apart.

[02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:59.820]
Call 2-LISA, Call 2-LISA, what you be doing.

[02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:05.980]
It's the opacious black head, token schmarts the top.

[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:13.400]
Is you take, cause you are at home, bootly, gloom?

[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:19.220]
Is you deflected and gymnami, who be smart?

[02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:27.400]
Does they like how you shot their shoes underneath the wall?

[02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:32.080]
All the way you watch and talk the white is cause.

[02:17:33.900 --> 02:17:38.740]
Georgia, Jr., say he trust you can't believe you.

[02:17:39.740 --> 02:17:45.060]
Do they lie lies on the greedy oil alone?

[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:51.620]
But then he make you clean all the white house bathrooms.

[02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:57.760]
The cup of scenes, the toilet, and then scrub the floor.

[02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:04.560]
They tell you don't wear sandals, can't believe you.

[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:11.100]
Your phone keeps on ill, makes them wanna wretch and you.

[02:18:12.460 --> 02:18:17.660]
Your napilanger, look as like it's evil throw.

[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:23.700]
It's your pee, what you to be, that token schoo.

[02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:25.700]
Huh?

[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:43.500]
That's when your head will move from side to side, from the Liza.

[02:18:45.140 --> 02:18:49.780]
It's your push and from here, they be cracked or at home.

[02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:52.560]
Here's another word of warning, all you potential blockheads people out there.

[02:18:52.620 --> 02:18:54.200]
Beware of bitchy right wing queens.

[02:18:55.380 --> 02:18:59.360]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 4. We sure got a lot of open lines now, like just about all of them.

[02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:00.660]
That's very sad.

[02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:02.380]
Is this way we're gonna start out the new year?

[02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:03.720]
Very sad to me.

[02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:07.440]
4th of January, 2003, 6th, whatever the holiday is.

[02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:13.620]
See one thing, because Norma would have called me if I would have been in Toronto yesterday and told me about Mike.

[02:19:14.780 --> 02:19:18.160]
And so I would have known about it and I would have gone online and we got in the article, the old bit from the aherald.

[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:19.360]
And I still would have had it.

[02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:25.500]
As opposed to Tom Jekko, who claims that I'm out of touch by not being here and I don't have my thumb on a pulse of it and he's right here in town.

[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:26.080]
Did he have it?

[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:26.320]
No.

[02:19:26.420 --> 02:19:27.000]
Oh, brother.

[02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:29.900]
Talk about the popcorn and kennel pink, Tom.

[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:30.800]
You're pathetic.

[02:19:31.380 --> 02:19:31.940]
You're tragic.

[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:34.240]
You're sad. You're an embarrassment.

[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:36.920]
I wouldn't wipe my ass with your freaking newspaper.

[02:19:39.600 --> 02:19:40.880]
Here's a call from Pemberpine.

[02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:41.200]
Hello.

[02:19:41.380 --> 02:19:42.520]
Can I apply for gold?

[02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:49.520]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 18 and 10 Verizon wireless line.

[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:51.540]
Point and V, chill out.

[02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:53.640]
Happy New Year, Uncle Neil.

[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:54.360]
And back to you.

[02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:57.840]
Hey, I wanted to tell you about a great book, so many bought it for a Christmas.

[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:00.740]
I think George would really enjoy it too.

[02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:04.100]
It's called Goliath, author named Steve Alton.

[02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:12.080]
It's really good because it deals with the victim of terrorism who ends up hijacking a nuclear sub.

[02:20:12.540 --> 02:20:16.940]
And he puts out a list of demands that read like George Bush's Christmas list.

[02:20:17.620 --> 02:20:25.860]
And it starts off with the execution of Saddam Hussein and a bunch of other figures like Castro and Kim Jong-il.

[02:20:25.860 --> 02:20:29.600]
And if the guy doesn't get what he wants, he's going to watch a nuke on Baghdad.

[02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:32.860]
And so you start rooting for the villain a bit.

[02:20:33.140 --> 02:20:37.460]
But I get them all the stories that Rosa Hell has paid with good intentions.

[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:39.960]
And things really get out of hand quickly.

[02:20:40.340 --> 02:20:45.340]
And it's amazing how many things the guy has in the book that are coming true on today's headlines.

[02:20:46.220 --> 02:20:47.000]
Really good book.

[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:47.800]
That's what I recommend.

[02:20:47.820 --> 02:20:48.740]
I'll check it out. Thanks a lot.

[02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:49.460]
Thank you.

[02:20:50.420 --> 02:20:53.500]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, five, where are the women here today again?

[02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:54.760]
Let's start the new year with that again.

[02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:56.020]
We had one, I think.

[02:20:56.520 --> 02:20:57.180]
One or two.

[02:20:58.240 --> 02:20:58.840]
Pretty weak.

[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:01.580]
Pretty weak response here on an opening day.

[02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:03.280]
January 6, 2003.

[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:04.640]
Get the new year off on the right foot.

[02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:05.420]
Can you guys do it?

[02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:05.620]
No.

[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:05.880]
No.

[02:21:07.340 --> 02:21:08.720]
Now this wasn't a hero this morning.

[02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:09.580]
Somebody faxes me.

[02:21:10.100 --> 02:21:11.560]
I guess we were, it's worth mentioning.

[02:21:12.340 --> 02:21:14.400]
Less than 24 hours after returning from the festival.

[02:21:14.620 --> 02:21:15.620]
You of himself were tailed back.

[02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:18.980]
Willis McGay, he had successful surgery on his left knee yesterday afternoon at Hellsoft.

[02:21:18.980 --> 02:21:21.680]
Dr. Suspital, the damage appeared to be less than like that.

[02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:25.980]
Well, he was going to be possibly drafted, you know, like high, first, whatever.

[02:21:27.020 --> 02:21:28.960]
And make a lot of money and buy a house for his mom.

[02:21:29.140 --> 02:21:30.320]
And it was a nice story.

[02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:34.400]
And it looked like it was going to be tragic because he got like just busted up his knee in that game Friday.

[02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:35.600]
It looked really nasty.

[02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:40.280]
It's not as serious as they thought it was going to be said Eugene Poole McGay, his older half brother.

[02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:42.020]
It wasn't reconstructive to me.

[02:21:43.500 --> 02:21:44.460]
So that's the good news.

[02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:46.260]
Okay, for all your hurricane people out there.

[02:21:46.260 --> 02:21:48.320]
And everybody else too, they want to see him like do good.

[02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:51.060]
Anybody out there want to see anybody do good?

[02:21:51.140 --> 02:21:51.280]
No.

[02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:52.000]
Not in this town.

[02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:53.280]
Not in this town.

[02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:55.020]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:58.060]
Our poll wants the best FM station in South Florida.

[02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:04.920]
And the reason I'm asking that is because I was trying desperately Friday and over the weekend to find a state.

[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:06.080]
Why do I keep doing it?

[02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:09.040]
You know, it's like I keep coming back here and expecting something to change.

[02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:09.860]
It's not going to change.

[02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:11.260]
The music's always going to suck.

[02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:14.460]
The programmers are always going to be a bunch of butt plugs.

[02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:16.320]
284 votes.

[02:22:16.460 --> 02:22:17.840]
I'll tell you the ones that have no votes.

[02:22:18.220 --> 02:22:19.660]
WSDJ, is that a spick station?

[02:22:20.380 --> 02:22:21.340]
I don't even know what it is.

[02:22:21.880 --> 02:22:23.820]
WFLC, the coast has got no votes, Disney.

[02:22:23.980 --> 02:22:24.600]
How do you like that?

[02:22:24.740 --> 02:22:25.180]
Ha ha!

[02:22:25.620 --> 02:22:26.600]
It's got zero!

[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:28.020]
It sucks!

[02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:28.900]
That's my opinion.

[02:22:29.180 --> 02:22:29.800]
I'm like Disney.

[02:22:29.980 --> 02:22:31.460]
W-A-M-R-W-R-M-A.

[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:32.780]
Each have no votes.

[02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:34.780]
I'll radio a romance, and radio a more no votes.

[02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:36.000]
I mean, we got no spiceless thing.

[02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:37.020]
Huh.

[02:22:38.720 --> 02:22:39.780]
Wonder what that's all about.

[02:22:40.900 --> 02:22:41.760]
Hot Scott won.

[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:43.180]
CMO, that's because George has been on.

[02:22:43.860 --> 02:22:44.760]
Hot Scott won.

[02:22:44.920 --> 02:22:46.780]
CMQ and radio, RITMO have got won.

[02:22:46.920 --> 02:22:48.540]
WMIV men and blacks got the same one.

[02:22:48.580 --> 02:22:49.560]
That's got to be Pete Boulder.

[02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:51.540]
Same one it's had all morning.

[02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:56.580]
RF3, Y103, Love4, L-Y-F, and P-Y-M tied with six.

[02:22:56.580 --> 02:22:57.380]
A match made in heaven.

[02:22:58.220 --> 02:22:59.860]
Power 96 got seven, kid curry.

[02:23:01.340 --> 02:23:03.080]
Boy, he was in here sucking around last week.

[02:23:03.200 --> 02:23:04.160]
Man, he just loves this show.

[02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:04.740]
He loves me.

[02:23:04.900 --> 02:23:05.960]
He loves George, and now he don't like George.

[02:23:06.900 --> 02:23:08.560]
Power 7, EDR9,

[02:23:10.020 --> 02:23:11.780]
KISS 10, Zeta 12.

[02:23:12.300 --> 02:23:14.020]
Magic's got 60 and Ricky Tiki.

[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:15.480]
Not to make Rick Flipp his cap.

[02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:18.880]
I should have asked him when he called in if he ever washes that thing out.

[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:21.620]
He, it's a part of him.

[02:23:22.620 --> 02:23:25.300]
When I used to see him at the dolphin games when I had my season tickets, you know.

[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:27.060]
And he used to sit a few rows in front of me.

[02:23:27.120 --> 02:23:28.360]
He'd always turn around and wave before the game.

[02:23:28.680 --> 02:23:29.920]
He always had that cap on.

[02:23:30.200 --> 02:23:32.380]
Yeah, but I have it, you know, seven different ones though.

[02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:34.800]
Ah, like most, like most peace.

[02:23:36.140 --> 02:23:38.380]
I didn't ask him if he has like a separate suckers cap.

[02:23:39.060 --> 02:23:44.260]
Magic's got 16, big is got 19, LRN 25, and they all suck 160,

[02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:48.400]
which is more than all the other ones put together on you programmers out there.

[02:23:48.500 --> 02:23:51.720]
All you fakers, all you may believe radio programmers,

[02:23:52.040 --> 02:23:54.080]
the audience says all your music blows.

[02:23:56.220 --> 02:24:01.820]
They wouldn't wish your music on Hitler, okay, and Sodom who's saying, and Yamama, Osama.

[02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:04.900]
And even George W, they wouldn't wish your music on.

[02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:08.600]
You think I'm going to get to the Dr. Phil's story?

[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:10.980]
Dr. Phil Nightmare made me a cripple.

[02:24:11.180 --> 02:24:12.060]
Don't let me forget that.

[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:14.860]
Anything negative about Dr. Phil we love on this show.

[02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:20.020]
And I keep forgetting to set my, speaking to my universal T-Bot, whatever they call my direct TV thing,

[02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:21.740]
I keep forgetting to set it for guiding light.

[02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:25.600]
See now you can't set it, so it'll tape it like every day at the same time.

[02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:27.100]
It'll take you two months, but you'll remember.

[02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:28.760]
Yeah.

[02:24:30.620 --> 02:24:35.580]
Oh god, to be able to pick up WVIB or whatever it is in Buffalo, CBS,

[02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:38.240]
and watch the guiding light of three o'clock.

[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:40.540]
I bet you I'm missing some pretty heavy duty traumatic stuff.

[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:43.680]
Although passions is, and if we ever have the wedding, I guess today is the wedding.

[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:49.340]
The weddings, Antonio, and Luis, and Beth and Beth's crazy mother.

[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:52.660]
Beth's crazy mother, whatever her name is, by the way, and passions is the best of the character

[02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:53.680]
of any soap opera in history.

[02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:56.440]
Even better than poor little Timmy, rest in peace.

[02:24:57.200 --> 02:24:59.820]
Now, when you give me a look, you don't watch that show, you know who that is?

[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:01.040]
It's a funny show.

[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:03.220]
It's a soap opera, that's a comedy, it's funny.

[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:06.360]
Give me a few laughs, and believe me, when you live in this guy's damn time,

[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:07.200]
you need a few laughs.

[02:25:07.460 --> 02:25:09.920]
Oh, Jimbo, what are we gonna do, Jimbo?

[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:12.520]
Did you hear that call?

[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:18.340]
This guy, I thought he was gonna reach, you know how they do that phony surgery, the Chinese?

[02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:23.360]
I thought he was gonna like try to reach inside his body, and he had his intestines out,

[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:25.080]
and just throw them all on the ground.

[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:30.300]
He was just so distraught because of a couple of, because of one at that point, only one football game.

[02:25:30.580 --> 02:25:33.000]
Now, after Friday night, this guy's gotta be dead.

[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:39.960]
He has got to, he has got to done the big slit from either that or maybe he had done it with OG over the weekend.

[02:25:40.260 --> 02:25:42.420]
Don't you think maybe OG out of bond with the Goldman's?

[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:48.840]
I thought that was a very apt analogy, him and Mo trying to suck up by mentioning my name now.

[02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:50.800]
Ain't gonna work, Mo, okay?

[02:25:51.060 --> 02:25:53.520]
You can promote this show 15 times a day, ain't gonna work.

[02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:57.220]
We already saw the color of your crap and here, peace.

[02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:00.420]
Fort Lauderdale, hello.

[02:26:01.420 --> 02:26:01.800]
Hello.

[02:26:02.100 --> 02:26:02.460]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:04.200]
Yeah, this is Marvin calling.

[02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:07.900]
I'd like to say a few words that I could have up my late friend, the micrenary.

[02:26:08.220 --> 02:26:10.480]
I learned the news sadly this morning.

[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.180]
I knew Mike for almost 30 years.

[02:26:14.060 --> 02:26:17.640]
I just wanted to say that Mike was one of the kindest, sweetest guys.

[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:19.960]
He was a real gentleman.

[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:21.880]
I never heard Mike ever bat mouth.

[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:25.440]
Anybody even after he got the Rob D.O. and IOD.

[02:26:25.740 --> 02:26:25.840]
Yeah.

[02:26:26.420 --> 02:26:27.940]
And I really miss him.

[02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:30.920]
And anybody that knew him will miss him too.

[02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:36.620]
So Mike, the next time I'm not addicted and I raise a glass of wine, my friend, my toast is to you.

[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:37.700]
We'll all miss you.

[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:38.180]
We love you.

[02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:39.260]
Amen. Thanks a lot, Marvin.

[02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:40.420]
Oh, I have to say.

[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:41.480]
I will say one thing.

[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:46.280]
I don't remember, because we got along great, but there was, I forget what I was talking about one day.

[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:49.080]
I made some little dig about something they did on his show.

[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:54.920]
And the next morning I'm coming in and his question of the day is, how do we make the near Roger show better?

[02:26:55.860 --> 02:26:56.860]
And it was his there.

[02:26:56.960 --> 02:26:57.820]
I came in and I looked at him.

[02:26:57.840 --> 02:26:59.080]
We both laughed our ass off.

[02:26:59.160 --> 02:26:59.520]
It was great.

[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:01.020]
But that's the kind of stuff he would do.

[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:03.120]
You know, like you're not, but not mean and vicious.

[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:05.100]
Not mean and vicious and malicious.

[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:07.840]
Like some people that we know rhymes with mo.

[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:08.700]
Okay.

[02:27:09.540 --> 02:27:10.740]
Malicious and hateful.

[02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:11.920]
Behind the scenes.

[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:12.680]
On the air.

[02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:14.620]
Hey, have a nice day and paradise everybody.

[02:27:14.620 --> 02:27:17.060]
You know, happy face in the public.

[02:27:17.420 --> 02:27:18.500]
But behind the scenes.

[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:22.760]
Ripping and stabbing and torturing and screwing over and effing.

[02:27:23.060 --> 02:27:24.840]
Like my good friend Roger, who wanted my job.

[02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:26.660]
Are you picking on Roger now?

[02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:27.260]
Sure.

[02:27:27.380 --> 02:27:28.820]
That's probably why he hasn't called him.

[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:32.120]
Because he's afraid I'll have to go through you first.

[02:27:33.220 --> 02:27:34.200]
Now, he don't want to tell me right on.

[02:27:35.540 --> 02:27:36.200]
How about Henry Barrel?

[02:27:36.420 --> 02:27:37.300]
Talk about that glider.

[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:38.120]
You'll notice him.

[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:38.560]
He won't call.

[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:39.940]
He's doing bear and he should be embarrassed.

[02:27:40.140 --> 02:27:41.400]
He, he up to a killer sky.

[02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:44.300]
He, he did.

[02:27:44.460 --> 02:27:45.720]
He helped him put the nailers cough.

[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:47.180]
I don't even know the details of his death.

[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:48.340]
I don't care what anybody says.

[02:27:48.460 --> 02:27:49.960]
Henry helped to kill the micronary.

[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:55.100]
I mean, wasn't it Mike that took Henry with him when he went over there to waxing?

[02:27:55.140 --> 02:27:55.960]
They put that show together.

[02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:56.440]
That phantom.

[02:27:56.440 --> 02:28:00.520]
They, they broker the time, bought the way back on the air, went out and sold his spots.

[02:28:01.980 --> 02:28:02.800]
All of that stuff.

[02:28:04.740 --> 02:28:07.880]
And then, you know, when he decided, well, maybe we aren't going to do that.

[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:11.380]
Henry goes behind his back with that marked Benson, with that anxious human name.

[02:28:11.380 --> 02:28:11.980]
And then, excuse.

[02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:17.380]
And they, they, they, it's like a sign of deal behind his back and take the show away from him.

[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:22.600]
Which is why he had a white up being out on the beach again for a short period of time before winding up with sheep channel.

[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:23.740]
A fate worse than death.

[02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:28.880]
That's why you won't hear from our fat friend Henry Barrel.

[02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:31.820]
And let me tell you, Henry, when you get as old as you're getting, believe you me.

[02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:32.840]
He's almost as old as Mo.

[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:35.520]
And you haven't been a fat tub all your life.

[02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:37.920]
And all of a sudden you start ballooning up like when we saw him back in November.

[02:28:38.300 --> 02:28:38.620]
Wow.

[02:28:39.700 --> 02:28:42.680]
You can start counting the days on one hand, I guess.

[02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:46.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 8th.

[02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:47.840]
I still can't get over fat boys ass.

[02:28:48.180 --> 02:28:51.100]
I mean, you know, if there's anything we airplane take over as well.

[02:28:51.100 --> 02:28:53.180]
If there's anything we need to picture of on our website,

[02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:55.200]
there will draw eight billion instant hits.

[02:28:55.700 --> 02:29:00.920]
If we could just have a picture of fat boys ass on our website and at the picture page.

[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:02.760]
Although, I don't know if we can get it all on there.

[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:04.040]
Maybe we'll have to have like segments.

[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:05.040]
Well, you can scroll.

[02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:08.140]
You can even scroll from the right cheek to the left cheek.

[02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:13.040]
You have never seen an ass, even Al Goldstein,

[02:29:13.860 --> 02:29:15.860]
it pales into its significance, a piker.

[02:29:16.020 --> 02:29:19.200]
His ass is like a baby ass compared to Jeff High.

[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:22.420]
Al's whole body is like one of his cheeks.

[02:29:22.660 --> 02:29:23.860]
Oh my god.

[02:29:25.200 --> 02:29:25.920]
What do you think?

[02:29:26.100 --> 02:29:26.800]
150 pounds?

[02:29:27.060 --> 02:29:27.940]
His ass alone.

[02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:29.100]
No, because he's 321.

[02:29:29.300 --> 02:29:29.760]
I got it out here.

[02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:30.680]
He got on the scale this morning.

[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:33.160]
The ass alone has got away 150 pounds.

[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:36.020]
Even Skippy agrees.

[02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:37.920]
He said, I've never seen such an ass in all my life.

[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.860]
The only problem is he was pointing at George when he said it.

[02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:41.080]
Watch yourself, Skippy.

[02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:42.160]
You can be replaced, okay?

[02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:42.600]
Easily.

[02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:45.400]
And a lot of you got 50 guys like Mad Doggo.

[02:29:45.540 --> 02:29:47.440]
He says, there's 50 guys out on the street standing online.

[02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:51.540]
We didn't take all those posh accounts you inherited from all those gimmies you inherited from Brian,

[02:29:51.740 --> 02:29:53.460]
who was a good guy and a real sales guy,

[02:29:54.120 --> 02:29:55.500]
which we can't say for you, Skippy.

[02:29:55.820 --> 02:29:56.860]
What was that all about?

[02:29:56.980 --> 02:29:57.280]
What's he...

[02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:58.540]
He's given Raymond the tour.

[02:29:58.700 --> 02:29:59.660]
Raymond, the new salesperson.

[02:30:00.020 --> 02:30:01.820]
Oh, Raymond, we got another new sales hole.

[02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:04.300]
Hey, Raymond, get out before it's too late, Raymond.

[02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:05.920]
Get out.

[02:30:07.740 --> 02:30:11.360]
We told that to what's his name, our good close personal friend Scott Schwartz.

[02:30:11.820 --> 02:30:12.500]
Wouldn't that his name?

[02:30:13.540 --> 02:30:14.500]
Scott Schwartz, what do we remember?

[02:30:14.660 --> 02:30:16.220]
How does Laura... Hey, Laura, how you doing, honey?

[02:30:16.980 --> 02:30:18.380]
Scott and Laura Schwartz, two good people.

[02:30:18.900 --> 02:30:20.620]
See, we worked with some good people in this business.

[02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:22.200]
I'm not such a hard-hearted bastard.

[02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:23.440]
I just tell it like it is.

[02:30:23.500 --> 02:30:24.740]
We've also worked with some assholes.

[02:30:25.460 --> 02:30:27.520]
And if you're going to be an asshole, I'm going to tell you, you're an asshole.

[02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:27.960]
That's all.

[02:30:30.300 --> 02:30:32.420]
If you're a good guy, we'll like P.O. over your leg.

[02:30:33.180 --> 02:30:34.700]
And maybe even help you wipe it off.

[02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:36.460]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[02:30:37.140 --> 02:30:37.960]
Nigger Neil guy.

[02:30:38.100 --> 02:30:38.860]
Yes, sir, speaking.

[02:30:39.160 --> 02:30:40.180]
Fred Wolf Jr. here.

[02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:41.500]
Oh, my God.

[02:30:41.500 --> 02:30:42.900]
Long time since we've heard from you.

[02:30:43.060 --> 02:30:44.660]
Yeah, I call maybe once every two years.

[02:30:44.840 --> 02:30:45.460]
Mr. Detroit.

[02:30:46.600 --> 02:30:48.740]
Right, WABX is still my favorite with Dave Dixon.

[02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:49.780]
How's the bowling coming?

[02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:50.500]
Oh, great.

[02:30:51.460 --> 02:30:54.340]
Actually, my dad used to... I'm not, of course, Fred Wolf Jr.

[02:30:54.560 --> 02:30:57.760]
But my dad did use to bowl with Fred Wolf, and I knew him pretty well when I was a kid.

[02:30:57.940 --> 02:30:58.160]
Really?

[02:30:58.500 --> 02:30:59.180]
That was pretty neat.

[02:30:59.340 --> 02:31:01.480]
I'll see, Fred Wolf used to be on WXYZ, right?

[02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:02.400]
WXY all the way.

[02:31:02.540 --> 02:31:02.660]
Right.

[02:31:02.940 --> 02:31:03.520]
Yeah, definitely.

[02:31:03.880 --> 02:31:07.560]
So, yeah, I was listening to you when you signed on this morning, and I was wondering

[02:31:07.560 --> 02:31:12.360]
why you were playing the Reneerie Betts, and I thought it had to be either really good or really bad.

[02:31:12.460 --> 02:31:12.920]
Yeah, it's bad.

[02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:14.360]
Unfortunately, it was really bad.

[02:31:14.700 --> 02:31:22.520]
And he's in the same league as Harry Carey, and even Ernie Harwell, just good guys.

[02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:25.960]
In fact, I put him in the same category with Fred Wolf or Herbert Oskar Anderson.

[02:31:25.960 --> 02:31:27.580]
It got us on for a very long time.

[02:31:27.760 --> 02:31:29.240]
He was like a legend and institution.

[02:31:29.240 --> 02:31:31.020]
People felt very comfortable listening to him.

[02:31:31.220 --> 02:31:32.240]
He was there all the time.

[02:31:32.380 --> 02:31:33.820]
I mean, he was like revolutionary, or anything.

[02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:35.900]
But he was just a good guy.

[02:31:36.080 --> 02:31:38.680]
Yeah, I tell you, I'm not very, not very great.

[02:31:38.860 --> 02:31:42.420]
But I met Ernie Harwell when he was down last summer with the Tigers playing tomorrow.

[02:31:42.580 --> 02:31:45.360]
And so, I've dragged him down and, you know, met him and all that.

[02:31:45.440 --> 02:31:46.120]
And what a great guy.

[02:31:46.260 --> 02:31:46.620]
You know what I mean?

[02:31:46.740 --> 02:31:47.940]
It's just like talking to a friend.

[02:31:48.060 --> 02:31:50.700]
He actually started asking me stuff about me.

[02:31:51.260 --> 02:31:53.520]
Like, he was interested in what I'm doing and stuff.

[02:31:53.720 --> 02:31:55.380]
And it was just what a great guy.

[02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:57.260]
And there's not many of those left.

[02:31:57.260 --> 02:32:01.060]
And, you know, the broadcasts these days, I know you were watching the football games just.

[02:32:02.020 --> 02:32:04.680]
And on Fox, they have Jimmy and Danny.

[02:32:05.220 --> 02:32:06.780]
And it's just, it's so pitiful.

[02:32:06.940 --> 02:32:07.300]
And these jocks.

[02:32:07.300 --> 02:32:08.020]
I see it.

[02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:09.380]
They can't even speak English.

[02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:09.780]
Yeah.

[02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:10.840]
And it's all jocks.

[02:32:11.160 --> 02:32:17.840]
And, and oh yeah, and they got this, this pathetic routine that they go through and they're all grabbing ass and laughing and puking and slapping each other on a bucket.

[02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:19.480]
It's just, it's just really tragic.

[02:32:19.480 --> 02:32:21.640]
And, you know, exactly the crowd that they're catering to.

[02:32:21.920 --> 02:32:24.380]
The same guys that called us radio station, the sports nerds.

[02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:25.240]
Right, it's disgusting.

[02:32:25.460 --> 02:32:26.640]
They're not professional broadcasts.

[02:32:26.640 --> 02:32:26.740]
Yeah.

[02:32:26.800 --> 02:32:27.600]
They're just shells.

[02:32:28.540 --> 02:32:33.680]
So anyway, I'm glad I really appreciate your letting people give homage to Mike on the era.

[02:32:33.680 --> 02:32:34.760]
He was one of a kind.

[02:32:35.380 --> 02:32:36.600]
And, and uh...

[02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:37.260]
At least we're out.

[02:32:37.340 --> 02:32:37.780]
Tell you one thing.

[02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:44.600]
At least we're getting a nice response on that, which is good because there have been many times over the years that somebody that we like or somebody been in a business long time has died.

[02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:48.840]
And we talk about on here and nobody has anything to say, which is sad.

[02:32:49.220 --> 02:32:51.200]
Well, they don't know from radio, unfortunately.

[02:32:51.400 --> 02:32:52.220]
They don't know from life.

[02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:53.060]
Forget about radio.

[02:32:53.180 --> 02:32:54.960]
They don't know from life from humanity down here.

[02:32:54.960 --> 02:33:00.020]
So, once again, thanks for doing kind of an on-ear wake for Mikey and he will be missed.

[02:33:00.140 --> 02:33:00.620]
Okay, Junior.

[02:33:00.800 --> 02:33:01.140]
See you, buddy.

[02:33:01.380 --> 02:33:01.620]
See you.

[02:33:02.020 --> 02:33:02.400]
Get the honey.

[02:33:03.180 --> 02:33:09.600]
Here's a fact that says Sympathase to Mikey's family also heard a bit of the sludge-coder lick fest self-hating queen, Alice Junior.

[02:33:09.800 --> 02:33:10.820]
Right, you got your thumb on it.

[02:33:11.820 --> 02:33:15.140]
Lastly, there was a fire in the area of West Hollywood and I...what?

[02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:16.840]
Is that Ives Derry?

[02:33:17.340 --> 02:33:18.300]
Oh, and I've seen her heard nothing.

[02:33:18.560 --> 02:33:18.980]
Do you know anything?

[02:33:19.140 --> 02:33:19.180]
No.

[02:33:19.460 --> 02:33:20.340]
Do we know anything?

[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:21.460]
Fire was about 1115?

[02:33:21.800 --> 02:33:21.980]
No.

[02:33:21.980 --> 02:33:27.700]
Are you kidding me, but our vast news resources here at WQIS, where the big news is that the final score was 3-2?

[02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:30.620]
We don't know from news.

[02:33:30.760 --> 02:33:31.400]
Do we have a newswire?

[02:33:31.520 --> 02:33:31.660]
No.

[02:33:31.660 --> 02:33:32.720]
Or whatever happened with that.

[02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:36.100]
Remember those days that Clarence was hawking me that we're going to get the AP newswire?

[02:33:36.300 --> 02:33:36.840]
We're going to...

[02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:40.020]
No, no, that always falls through after the billboards.

[02:33:40.500 --> 02:33:42.100]
Oh, after those big billboards, right?

[02:33:43.460 --> 02:33:44.840]
Here's another facts.

[02:33:46.700 --> 02:33:48.000]
Good thing he's not a sucessful.

[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:54.260]
The only reason that I'm reading these is to convey to the audience what it really means to be chronic and have no life and to be just sick.

[02:33:54.720 --> 02:33:55.100]
Sick.

[02:33:56.540 --> 02:33:57.340]
Another facts.

[02:33:57.740 --> 02:34:00.440]
Neil, don't invite me to visit you with the Panthers' game or anywhere else.

[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:01.100]
I was serious.

[02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:03.660]
Your personal attack went too far.

[02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:05.360]
You'll never have to see me again.

[02:34:05.540 --> 02:34:06.000]
All right.

[02:34:06.940 --> 02:34:11.780]
It's amazing how one hello can stir up hostilities from six, seven, even eight years ago.

[02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:13.760]
Don't classify me with those other freaks.

[02:34:14.260 --> 02:34:15.600]
Years ago, I contributed to your show.

[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:19.080]
You still play some of my cards, including Don Shula, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I.

[02:34:19.260 --> 02:34:21.200]
You don't remember there were good times you said...

[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:25.260]
If there were never any good times with you, there were good times on the show they had nothing to do with you.

[02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:27.020]
Yeah, there's a couple of cute things on there.

[02:34:27.260 --> 02:34:28.020]
So what does that mean?

[02:34:28.820 --> 02:34:29.680]
Where the hell is that?

[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:59.640]
Don Shula, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I

[02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:03.920]
I don't do my show any underwear and they don't smell. How do you like that? I'm not full of

[02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:09.880]
Schmidt like you are. Like he's concerned about where I'm from. This is the same guy who

[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:13.380]
with the track was telling me how great this show was sounded lately, okay? Well, it's mostly lately.

[02:35:13.540 --> 02:35:23.040]
I've been doing my country in my underwear that smell. And some smelly country. Who are you fooling, okay?

[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:30.740]
This is a man who will never go away. Never, never, ever go away. Compulsive. His entire life revolves around.

[02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:37.120]
This freaking sorry ass radio show. God. He's the poster child for I have no life.

[02:35:39.100 --> 02:35:44.040]
Did you ever, did you ever meet him? Yeah, when you used to do appearances. Oh,

[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:50.100]
matter of fact, what was the the Broward Mall? I think it was your birthday appearance or one of those.

[02:35:51.700 --> 02:35:58.380]
Yeah, a mall appearance. He showed up at one. And you survived the telebonder? Well, he didn't talk to me.

[02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:04.160]
Hey, George, don't like you, Greg. In fact, George, would like to invite you down and have lunch with him

[02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:07.980]
to money. He fills in next time on the next show right here in this country and this smelly country.

[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:15.200]
And you can even bring your smelly underwear. Four minutes till noon at 560 WQA. I'm on a great

[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:20.860]
Monday, man. Yeah, I can feel it. I can smell it. Oh, that's Greg's underwear. Sorry. Do you have any idea

[02:36:20.860 --> 02:36:24.340]
the sexual excitement he's getting from I mentioned his name and talking about this and reading the facts

[02:36:24.340 --> 02:36:28.240]
again? See because if you really wanted to go away, you wouldn't have sent another facts. Would you?

[02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:33.680]
Fuck plug. In fact, every fact that you sent, I'll read it on the ear. How do you like that?

[02:36:34.560 --> 02:36:38.280]
For the next four years, every fact that you send, I'll read it on the ear. In fact,

[02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:40.620]
send me one that says I'm not going to send you any more facts.

[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:49.400]
Right. That would be like if your mother said I'm never coming back for dinner again until the next time.

[02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:54.420]
Until the next time. Like if I told my mother, I'm never coming to lunch again.

[02:36:55.720 --> 02:37:00.880]
As a matter of fact, and if I catch her putting that paprika and black pepper on those ground brown

[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:04.720]
burgers again, man, I'm going to tell you something. The Schmidt's going to hit the fan or the bowl.

[02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:10.020]
One or the other. Maybe Jeff uses some of that at the loft. You know what? Some of that heavy

[02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:14.140]
duty paprika because boy, it makes you Schmidt your brains out. I mean, the and the results are almost

[02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:17.780]
instantaneous. If we have any old farce less than the audience who are like plugged up for the last

[02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:22.540]
few weeks or months or years, just get some of those ground brown burgers in my mother's house.

[02:37:23.260 --> 02:37:25.340]
They will like set you free.

[02:37:28.100 --> 02:37:32.440]
Saw Todd Dreck this morning speaking of to loose laddreck. Saw her in here this morning,

[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:37.900]
little Todd Dreck about three feet tall, three pounds of crap. I got a new copy. I got it right

[02:37:37.900 --> 02:37:41.060]
here as a matter of fact in my hand. That's why I'm thinking about him. Finally got a new piece of

[02:37:41.060 --> 02:37:44.380]
copy. No reason we got that is because they got this special seminar going on tomorrow.

[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:49.640]
They got this special scam. I mean seven are going on at Fast Train. That's the only reason we saw

[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:53.160]
Todd Dreck and he never did come back with the other copy that's supposed to start tomorrow. Never came

[02:37:53.160 --> 02:38:01.280]
back with it. A man who can't and won't and don't. Those are his middle names, Todd Dreck.

[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:05.960]
By the way, welcome to our sales department. The two new recluses we got in here today,

[02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:10.360]
whoever the LAR wonder where they got them from. Probably more of Todd Winick's rejects.

[02:38:11.740 --> 02:38:15.020]
What you think? I'll check his resume. Yeah.

[02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:19.900]
Probably work somewhere at Cheap Channel or maybe they worked over there at next to Chuck Sub-Sah center.

[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:24.440]
You know that nice little strip shopping center next door with the CVS? Oh that one.

[02:38:26.220 --> 02:38:30.680]
Probably in that convenience store there. The crowd liquor. Yeah. Yeah. The furniture shop.

[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:33.240]
Where they have that you make who in the store and a jerk chicken and jerk this.

[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:37.220]
Hey guys, the new year is here. If your new year's resolution is a high-paint computer career,

[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:42.580]

50 minutes of your life. Fast Train can have you certified ready for your dream job in just

[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:13.620]

[02:39:13.620 --> 02:39:17.860]
my computer at home? Get wet it. Well yeah. Instead of sitting in there talking to him all day,

[02:39:17.940 --> 02:39:21.720]
do something constructive. I'll write you got the other stuff done. That's good. That I work very

[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:25.600]
hard to get all those very important stories and the book and all of these things. But now write

[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:28.620]

[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:46.860]
My name is Michael. This is Fort Radio 560.

[02:39:47.500 --> 02:39:52.560]
You can't wait to weigh. Just Dave Goldstein. But you can call me Galzie. Whenever I'm in town,

[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:56.400]
I listen to, wait a minute, I am in town. It's the 12th of one hour.

[02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:05.720]
And Gold there is a party girl slut party girl slut party girl slut

[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:06.100]
Now do it likesad

[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:14.560]
And Gold there is a party girl slut party girl slut party girl slut

[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:23.800]
I Schla Then it

[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:24.320]
islin

[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:26.360]
She's good, man.

[02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:28.460]
She's good, man.

[02:40:28.460 --> 02:40:28.460]

[02:40:28.820 --> 02:40:29.540]
She's nice.

[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:30.600]
She's nice.

[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:31.660]
She's nice.

[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:42.640]
A devil, no, a devil, no, a devil, no, a devil, no, a devil, no, a devil, no, a devil, no, a devil, no.

[02:40:44.100 --> 02:40:45.320]
Hello, brothers, monster.

[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:48.760]
A good girl who wants to be a media home, prefers it on top quiver.

[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:49.640]
You want power?

[02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:50.620]
Only Slady?

[02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:51.760]
Here's what I'll give you.

[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:53.720]
She's got a book to read about Slammering.

[02:40:54.020 --> 02:40:57.100]
Nobody knows for about Slammering out with a big scoop of mouth.

[02:40:57.240 --> 02:40:58.880]
Anyone to the left of Mangala?

[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:00.280]
Such a good, christian girl.

[02:41:00.500 --> 02:41:01.580]
You want to strangle her?

[02:41:01.860 --> 02:41:03.420]
Fountain of vacating who she's hating.

[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:07.720]
Political funded, pontificating, Trump on the floor and masturbating.

[02:41:08.300 --> 02:41:09.780]
A Republican skanky home.

[02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:11.900]
She's a federalist, emote.

[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:14.320]
Plaking liberal is dirty work, you know.

[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:16.480]
In a mini-starcho and camel dough.

[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:20.560]
And culture knows what they can be.

[02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:22.620]
In a mini-starch that spells fish she.

[02:41:22.740 --> 02:41:25.880]
She's a tall drink of water on the side of a large order with a back alley look.

[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:31.060]
If you like your broad dollar, if you got the money, she'll spread those legs with a cigarette and a shark's name.

[02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:35.380]
And culture and culture, political funded, the angel of the right, energy's elated.

[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:37.900]
So here's the fact that this condolences to micro-intering in his family.

[02:41:37.980 --> 02:41:41.040]
I think Lynn Samuels, whom I love, is the screener for Miss Luges Radio Show.

[02:41:41.340 --> 02:41:42.780]
That is correct. She screens the call.

[02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:43.320]
Did you know that?

[02:41:43.740 --> 02:41:44.040]
No.

[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:44.560]
Oh yeah.

[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:52.020]
So I would imagine she was down to her IOD this past week when Miss Luges was filling in for the Schmidt Meister,

[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:53.300]
which I think is very appropriate.

[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:54.320]
You know, Matt Grudge.

[02:41:55.340 --> 02:42:00.640]
And anyway, the good news is we just got two, I just got two emails from Lynn, who says she is there.

[02:42:00.740 --> 02:42:01.260]
She's listening.

[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:03.240]
And she would never get mad at me.

[02:42:03.620 --> 02:42:05.040]
See, she's got a sense of humor.

[02:42:07.220 --> 02:42:12.400]
Unlike the right wingers who wanted to take stuff out of context like Kiss and Eager Good Morning and Condoleez and stuff like that.

[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:15.980]
Who pretend they don't have a sense of humor, but that's because they want to stab you in the back and destroy your life.

[02:42:16.220 --> 02:42:18.340]
As you'll find out in that book, what's the name of the book?

[02:42:20.500 --> 02:42:21.300]
Blinded by the right?

[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:24.180]
By David Brock? Excellent book. Go out and get it.

[02:42:24.340 --> 02:42:25.540]
Okay. Go out and steal one.

[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.740]
Also it says PS, can you play any of the learning to spell with our Nell Bits?

[02:42:29.980 --> 02:42:30.340]
No.

[02:42:32.420 --> 02:42:34.620]
This is learning to spell with Donnell.

[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:36.340]
I'll be Donnell Jackson.

[02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:38.760]
And today we're going to spell the word European.

[02:42:39.640 --> 02:42:40.580]
Spell it with me now.

[02:42:43.340 --> 02:42:44.060]
European EUROPEA.

[02:42:44.660 --> 02:42:45.460]
That's a big one.

[02:42:46.140 --> 02:42:47.820]
Now, let's use it in a sentence.

[02:42:48.420 --> 02:42:51.960]
So I said to the guy, I say, hey, get away from my car.

[02:42:52.380 --> 02:42:53.680]
European on my time.

[02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:56.320]
This is learning to spell with Donnell.

[02:42:56.880 --> 02:42:58.360]
I'll be Donnell Jackson.

[02:43:00.140 --> 02:43:02.100]
Just drop it in there this short. Why the hell not?

[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:04.860]
We're here to make people happy. That's it. That's our thing on the new year.

[02:43:04.980 --> 02:43:05.940]
Okay. In case you were out of time.

[02:43:06.180 --> 02:43:10.420]
We're not going to be sitting here doing bedtime stories and pontificating and try to save the world from itself.

[02:43:10.420 --> 02:43:11.540]
Can't do it.

[02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:13.180]
Entertainment. That's what people want.

[02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:15.120]
Like that one guy said, put a little smirk on his face.

[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:16.680]
That's the best we can do.

[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:18.760]
And we'll take the money right to the bank. Thank you.

[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:19.220]
And that's it.

[02:43:20.940 --> 02:43:22.540]
Oh, yeah, but you're going to be placed rush.

[02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:23.560]
You're going to be the right, yeah.

[02:43:24.380 --> 02:43:24.940]
Rush this.

[02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:26.940]
Even Miss Drudge is unscindicated.

[02:43:27.060 --> 02:43:27.760]
How do you like them apples?

[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:32.920]
We try to guess his proof that no matter how many markets you're in, it's still the same crap.

[02:43:34.380 --> 02:43:34.880]
Oh, Ann.

[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:37.660]
Ann, let's go tell some liberals.

[02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:40.760]
Anyway, here's now this is interesting.

[02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:46.720]
And I'm going to need your help here. It says, uh, check out the translation of this flyer passed out in the homes in highly and Miami.

[02:43:47.100 --> 02:43:49.820]
Board to pay a great deal by the cable and not to see anything.

[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:51.240]
This is an ad for dish TV.

[02:43:52.540 --> 02:43:53.660]
And here's the other one that says,

[02:43:53.860 --> 02:43:57.940]
Concentred de Picar Mucho, a aburido, uh, they know very not up for a cable.

[02:43:59.120 --> 02:43:59.460]
Cavalay.

[02:44:00.460 --> 02:44:00.820]
Okay.

[02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:02.500]
Would you still would say cable, right?

[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:03.320]
Cavalay.

[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:04.440]
Sure.

[02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:05.700]
Oh, no.

[02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:06.280]
Barred word.

[02:44:07.300 --> 02:44:07.580]
Cable.

[02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:10.240]
Anyway, it says our our TV TOR.

[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:11.060]
What is TOR?

[02:44:12.900 --> 02:44:14.940]
Le of phrase, they totally like who I can't say.

[02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:16.080]
I've heard of here a much more.

[02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:21.720]
It's not a bad, we're not a bad reading for me because I usually do put the emphasis in the wrong places.

[02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:23.880]
Well, I don't have a flow of it usually.

[02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:29.180]
In addition to which when I get to word like, of phrase say, I will say of phrase say because the sea is an Italian.

[02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:29.940]
Right.

[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:32.280]
And I can tell you much better.

[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:34.720]
Uh, gratis.

[02:44:35.860 --> 02:44:37.200]
Systema de TV por setelite.

[02:44:38.540 --> 02:44:38.900]
Setelite.

[02:44:39.020 --> 02:44:40.460]
Why is the ascent over the ee?

[02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:40.840]
Satellite.

[02:44:42.100 --> 02:44:42.460]
Satellite.

[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:46.500]
Instalacion, profecial, uh, standard.

[02:44:46.780 --> 02:44:47.300]
I don't know what that.

[02:44:47.380 --> 02:44:48.280]
So why what does that mean?

[02:44:48.380 --> 02:44:49.920]
It says the same thing there is does here.

[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:50.720]
I don't get it.

[02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:51.860]
I don't get it.

[02:44:51.900 --> 02:44:52.860]
Why are you sending me this stuff?

[02:44:52.860 --> 02:44:55.580]
I'm sorry. It must be Mark Benson again screaming about people who want to speak English.

[02:44:55.900 --> 02:44:57.100]
And god damn it's speaking English.

[02:44:57.380 --> 02:44:57.440]
What?

[02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:03.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[02:45:03.700 --> 02:45:05.140]
We got a million votes on the poll here.

[02:45:05.420 --> 02:45:05.700]
Carlos.

[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:07.960]
Pretty good response.

[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:09.740]
Now that George is off here, I mean,

[02:45:10.920 --> 02:45:12.560]
George just doesn't do good polls.

[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:14.700]
He's got everybody listening to just two things.

[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:16.260]
Number one, he doesn't do good poll number two.

[02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:16.860]
They don't like him.

[02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:20.160]
How can I get this damn mouse working?

[02:45:20.260 --> 02:45:21.580]
Boy, this is frosting my ass.

[02:45:22.060 --> 02:45:24.760]
We asked what's the best FM station in South Florida.

[02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:26.140]
347 votes.

[02:45:26.140 --> 02:45:27.820]
We didn't put this baby up till 10 o'clock.

[02:45:28.620 --> 02:45:29.020]
Right?

[02:45:29.980 --> 02:45:30.380]
Right?

[02:45:30.540 --> 02:45:32.780]
It's not too bad considering we're going to have to work our way back.

[02:45:32.860 --> 02:45:34.580]
I would say about two months we'll get the audience back.

[02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:36.940]
They all suck 200.

[02:45:38.420 --> 02:45:38.820]
WLRN32.

[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:40.580]
And that's a long cry from 232.

[02:45:41.580 --> 02:45:41.820]
You know what?

[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:44.800]
Even though of course the other ones are dividing themselves up, I do understand that.

[02:45:46.400 --> 02:45:47.780]
WBGG big 23.

[02:45:47.980 --> 02:45:48.540]
That's a joke.

[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:49.180]
That's a joke.

[02:45:49.180 --> 02:45:52.840]
If they took Howard off that station, like I said before, they could flush it down to toilet.

[02:45:53.660 --> 02:45:55.640]
It's a classic croc.

[02:45:55.920 --> 02:45:57.000]
Zeta 18.

[02:45:57.320 --> 02:45:57.760]
I'm not...

[02:45:57.760 --> 02:45:58.940]
Who are these people?

[02:45:59.320 --> 02:45:59.600]
Zeta?

[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:01.020]
Have you listened to them lately?

[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:01.760]
I tried.

[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:07.380]
And not only that, but I think technically they must have some kind of problems or something because they're like muffled.

[02:46:07.560 --> 02:46:08.640]
There's something wrong with their signal.

[02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:13.260]
They were playing the same crap from two years ago when I popped it back.

[02:46:13.320 --> 02:46:15.000]
Oh, just awful stuff.

[02:46:15.980 --> 02:46:16.460]
Magic.

[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:19.860]
WMXJ17, I guess those are the foundations voting several times.

[02:46:20.180 --> 02:46:20.860]
They'll be a buttercup.

[02:46:22.540 --> 02:46:23.240]
Kiss 11.

[02:46:23.500 --> 02:46:26.440]
11 people like Kiss country, country and those pickers.

[02:46:26.580 --> 02:46:26.920]
All right.

[02:46:27.500 --> 02:46:28.100]
That's our crowd.

[02:46:28.860 --> 02:46:30.200]
Power 9, EDR 9.

[02:46:30.540 --> 02:46:32.080]
Party radios only got 7 Disney.

[02:46:32.860 --> 02:46:33.400]
Life 6.

[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:34.200]
Love 4.

[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:34.780]
A 5.

[02:46:35.260 --> 02:46:36.040]
And from there, it's downhill.

[02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:37.780]
I'll tell you several, let's still have zero.

[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:41.400]
Radio WLMA has none.

[02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:42.960]
Radio Amor has none.

[02:46:43.380 --> 02:46:45.060]
WFLC, the coast still got a zero.

[02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:46.220]
It sucks.

[02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:48.000]
Although actually their music isn't that bad.

[02:46:49.140 --> 02:46:54.820]
If I were to have to rate them in order, I would put the RMA first and the coast second.

[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:56.100]
Of course, that's my taste in music.

[02:46:56.320 --> 02:46:57.520]
I don't want to hear the crap.

[02:46:57.820 --> 02:47:00.180]
I mean, I like classic rock too, but I just don't play any here.

[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:04.620]
CMQ1 or XD data doesn't have any either.

[02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:06.460]
CMQ and RTO.

[02:47:06.580 --> 02:47:08.100]
So we don't have any spics list in that, George.

[02:47:08.100 --> 02:47:09.740]
You chased all those spics away while you were on.

[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:11.420]
We don't have any.

[02:47:11.420 --> 02:47:14.320]
I mean, certainly if we did, they'd be voting for some of those Julio stations.

[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:17.000]
We don't have any Julio's listed on this show now.

[02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:18.200]
No.

[02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:18.880]
Boy.

[02:47:19.260 --> 02:47:20.140]
What is that all about?

[02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:22.200]
No, I don't know.

[02:47:22.300 --> 02:47:24.640]
No wonder our numbers are dropping like a rock.

[02:47:24.780 --> 02:47:26.200]
Not that we care anymore, quite frankly.

[02:47:26.780 --> 02:47:27.660]
We don't really care.

[02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:29.000]
We just try to build up Mo.

[02:47:30.220 --> 02:47:31.040]
Here's Coral Gables.

[02:47:31.220 --> 02:47:31.360]
Hello.

[02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:32.600]
Hey, Neil.

[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:34.980]
I'm pretty shook up over the death of Mike.

[02:47:35.980 --> 02:47:38.620]
He really was a JP McCarthy of Miami radio.

[02:47:38.860 --> 02:47:40.240]
Yeah, that's another good comparison, right?

[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:47.200]
Yeah, I mean, it's really upsetting because there's no one left from that ear of the bill caller.

[02:47:48.900 --> 02:47:50.780]
Well, the only one that would be left would be...

[02:47:50.780 --> 02:47:51.500]
Longing listed on this.

[02:47:51.500 --> 02:47:53.340]
He's gone on to a bigger and worse thing.

[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:53.720]
That's right.

[02:47:53.940 --> 02:47:54.960]
He's the only one still alive.

[02:47:55.120 --> 02:47:56.040]
Big Wilson is gone.

[02:47:56.560 --> 02:47:57.620]
And Bill and the Mike, right?

[02:47:57.660 --> 02:47:57.880]
Yeah.

[02:47:58.280 --> 02:47:59.900]
And Rick Weaver and Sonny Hirsch.

[02:48:00.220 --> 02:48:00.720]
That's right.

[02:48:01.060 --> 02:48:02.140]
They were a big part of the station.

[02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:03.420]
That station was great.

[02:48:03.960 --> 02:48:09.900]
That was a great radio station during the 70s, 80s, and even the 90s when you guys were on.

[02:48:09.900 --> 02:48:10.140]
Right.

[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:11.260]
With Rick and Sonny.

[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:11.440]
Right.

[02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:14.440]
And then the minute that they sold it to Paxton, that was the beginning of the end.

[02:48:14.740 --> 02:48:15.420]
That was tragic.

[02:48:15.540 --> 02:48:16.200]
That really was.

[02:48:17.240 --> 02:48:19.440]
You guys haven't heard from Aver Brown today, huh?

[02:48:19.620 --> 02:48:20.140]
I'm surprised.

[02:48:20.380 --> 02:48:20.560]
No.

[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:22.880]
Or Bob.

[02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:23.840]
Bob Green.

[02:48:24.860 --> 02:48:28.840]
The man that fired when he was going to call, that would be like expecting Henry Barrow, who stabbed him in the back.

[02:48:29.100 --> 02:48:33.920]
See, when people screw people over, then the people that they screw over die, they have nothing to say.

[02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:34.600]
Yeah.

[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:37.200]
But thanks for doing this, Neil.

[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:37.900]
He was a good man.

[02:48:37.900 --> 02:48:38.720]
He was a great guy.

[02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:39.300]
OK, thanks.

[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:40.900]
See, that's good.

[02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:42.680]
Mike Greenery passed away in case he'd tune in late.

[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:44.820]
He passed away Friday after a brief illness.

[02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:45.660]
The orbits in the hero.

[02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:46.040]
That's it.

[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:46.800]
There's nothing else in there.

[02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:50.200]
I think this is...it's tragic.

[02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:52.640]
Don't you agree with me?

[02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:52.980]
Yeah.

[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:53.840]
I mean, what can...

[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:54.360]
Did you see the story?

[02:48:54.420 --> 02:48:56.240]
Look at the size of the story on the obituary page.

[02:48:56.480 --> 02:48:57.220]
There's no picture.

[02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:00.080]
There's no, you know, it's just a little, a few paragraphs.

[02:49:01.220 --> 02:49:06.060]
I mean, it seems to me that almost 30 years on the year and the degree of success and popularity that it had

[02:49:06.060 --> 02:49:07.560]
should mirrored a little bit more than that.

[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:09.880]
And nothing in the Sun Sentinel.

[02:49:10.220 --> 02:49:11.120]
You know, I want to say it again.

[02:49:11.260 --> 02:49:16.800]
Tom Jicke, you can talk about me doing a show from Amsterdam, from Moscow, from the moon, from Uranus.

[02:49:17.100 --> 02:49:20.260]
I'm always more in touch with what's going on here than you'll ever be.

[02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:23.360]
Because you're in La La Land.

[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:29.720]
Your whole brain is just...is been taken over by a network propaganda about this network show and that network show.

[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:31.440]
And another one is going to be canceled in five minutes.

[02:49:31.620 --> 02:49:32.180]
And that's it.

[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:33.680]
That's what we read in the Sun Sentinel.

[02:49:35.340 --> 02:49:39.000]
You know, yesterday I go out and get my Sunday newspapers because I get them both.

[02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:46.880]
I bring them in a house and one of the great things I enjoy, like in Toronto, I get the star and the sun every day, especially on Sunday.

[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:49.800]
The other ones don't print on Sunday.

[02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:51.920]
And I read those papers.

[02:49:52.100 --> 02:49:54.100]
I can read them for two hours on a Sunday morning.

[02:49:54.800 --> 02:49:56.500]
I can read the Harold and the Sun Sentinel.

[02:49:56.700 --> 02:49:59.380]
In other words, what's worth reading in 15 minutes on a Sunday?

[02:49:59.380 --> 02:50:05.360]
There's nothing in there except the big Brandsmart ad section and 85 million other ads.

[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:07.180]
There's like 15 pounds of ads.

[02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:09.660]
So somebody's making a lot of money. That's nice to see.

[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:13.460]
So if you're making all of that money, how come you can't hire a real couple of journalists?

[02:50:13.660 --> 02:50:14.880]
Somebody would write like a real column.

[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:17.000]
What's that going to happen?

[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:19.460]
So sad.

[02:50:20.820 --> 02:50:22.600]
5, 6, 7...oh, now wait a minute.

[02:50:22.860 --> 02:50:24.460]
Is this for real call from Chicago? Hello?

[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:24.960]
Hello.

[02:50:25.380 --> 02:50:25.760]
Yes, sir.

[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:26.800]
Hi, how's it going?

[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:27.400]
Okay.

[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:30.720]
You know, I'm looking at your survey.

[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:35.440]
It's amazing that you have that about the radio stations.

[02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:48.320]
Because I was noticing, like when I go around different cities, there's no station that'll play something like the Talking Heads and then fall it up with Dave Matthews Band.

[02:50:48.920 --> 02:50:50.040]
Dave Matthews Band?

[02:50:50.620 --> 02:50:50.880]
Okay.

[02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:52.700]
The thing is that they...

[02:50:52.700 --> 02:50:55.420]
There's somebody farting there, by the way, because it's seeping in here, man.

[02:50:55.520 --> 02:50:56.800]
It smells like bad gang.

[02:50:56.920 --> 02:50:57.540]
That's yours, as well.

[02:50:57.880 --> 02:51:01.120]
From the...I think they're pumping it in. Probably a Mo has something to do with.

[02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:01.600]
Go ahead, sir.

[02:51:01.980 --> 02:51:06.340]
Well, they...you know, like DC, they have Q101 and San Francisco has Alice.

[02:51:06.800 --> 02:51:06.980]
Yeah.

[02:51:07.160 --> 02:51:12.660]
You know, where they'll play new stuff and old stuff, but in South Florida, they'll just play all the...

[02:51:12.660 --> 02:51:13.080]
World crap.

[02:51:13.600 --> 02:51:14.800]
Never anything brand new, though.

[02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:17.320]
Yeah, it's...well, yeah, it's kind of weird.

[02:51:17.420 --> 02:51:20.540]
Anyway, I guess that was it.

[02:51:20.540 --> 02:51:22.960]
Okay, well, Kista, Kista, ground that you're there and not here, okay?

[02:51:23.440 --> 02:51:25.100]
And I hope your lips don't freeze to the sidewalk.

[02:51:25.740 --> 02:51:28.080]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[02:51:28.160 --> 02:51:28.880]
That's a good time, man.

[02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:30.380]
Chicago, Joe Castella, go to go there?

[02:51:31.360 --> 02:51:33.840]
See, I don't want to start, because it's already over with them.

[02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:34.880]
I'm sure they had a wonderful time.

[02:51:35.260 --> 02:51:37.560]
If he would have taken, you needed to do Chicago, for example.

[02:51:38.360 --> 02:51:39.860]
That would have been a great...

[02:51:39.860 --> 02:51:42.360]
Honey, but the Vegas weddings are a tradition kind of thing.

[02:51:42.920 --> 02:51:43.480]
No, they're not.

[02:51:43.880 --> 02:51:45.720]
They're a tradition for scumbags like you.

[02:51:46.600 --> 02:51:47.200]
Not for...

[02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:50.520]
What do you care about big white weddings with addresses and the tuxes and goadins?

[02:51:51.280 --> 02:51:52.720]
That's what they're doing on passions.

[02:51:52.960 --> 02:51:53.320]
Yeah.

[02:51:54.120 --> 02:51:55.600]
And what that was the movie that I...

[02:51:55.600 --> 02:51:58.340]
Oh, and on the end-run thing last night, that was the thing too.

[02:51:58.620 --> 02:52:01.040]
Because he was trying to keep up with the Jones as well.

[02:52:01.040 --> 02:52:02.380]
All these executives in the company.

[02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:04.520]
And so his fiance was getting...

[02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:06.180]
She was a gas, if I can say that.

[02:52:06.680 --> 02:52:09.720]
Because he was like, you're getting the wedding consultant to come in

[02:52:09.720 --> 02:52:11.240]
and planning of a 200-guessing.

[02:52:11.240 --> 02:52:11.680]
Right, exactly.

[02:52:11.680 --> 02:52:12.480]
And all of a sudden, are you...

[02:52:12.480 --> 02:52:14.260]
What do you mean by that?

[02:52:14.420 --> 02:52:18.020]
I'm not talking about the nature of the wedding itself.

[02:52:18.340 --> 02:52:18.500]
Yeah.

[02:52:18.500 --> 02:52:20.000]
I'm talking about where you have it.

[02:52:20.120 --> 02:52:22.460]
And, you know, you can't just fly to Chicago and get married.

[02:52:24.960 --> 02:52:25.520]
Everyone else...

[02:52:25.520 --> 02:52:25.800]
Why not?

[02:52:25.980 --> 02:52:28.460]
Because you can get your license and get married five minutes later.

[02:52:28.600 --> 02:52:29.280]
That's the way it works there.

[02:52:29.340 --> 02:52:30.160]
Everybody else, you gotta...

[02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:30.900]
Well, I don't understand.

[02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:32.760]
They've been living together for, what, 15 years?

[02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:33.980]
Since they were like 10 years old.

[02:52:34.100 --> 02:52:35.140]
I don't think you're gonna mail order?

[02:52:36.020 --> 02:52:37.260]
Vegas is set up for it.

[02:52:37.960 --> 02:52:39.080]
That has all those chapels.

[02:52:39.100 --> 02:52:39.940]
Well, let me ask you something.

[02:52:40.220 --> 02:52:42.280]
How about if they would have gotten married here first?

[02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:43.600]
And then they would have gone to Chicago?

[02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:45.780]
Then they would have had to do the church thing.

[02:52:45.780 --> 02:52:46.440]
Let me sit again.

[02:52:46.440 --> 02:52:48.140]
No, they would not have had to do that.

[02:52:48.340 --> 02:52:48.860]
They could have done it.

[02:52:48.900 --> 02:52:49.940]
They could have both had to pay.

[02:52:49.940 --> 02:52:52.360]
They could have gotten the blind priest from passions could have come in there.

[02:52:53.360 --> 02:52:54.020]
I don't know.

[02:52:54.140 --> 02:52:54.960]
I would have arranged it.

[02:52:55.940 --> 02:52:56.520]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:52:56.520 --> 02:52:56.920]
Hello.

[02:52:57.800 --> 02:52:58.200]
Yeah.

[02:52:58.440 --> 02:53:00.000]
Father Nocee, I think you're calling me, sir.

[02:53:01.560 --> 02:53:02.160]
Winnery here.

[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:04.180]
It's true.

[02:53:04.760 --> 02:53:08.380]
Cookie, me and Mary Bence are always did wear cock rings on the air.

[02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:13.280]
Ah...

[02:53:13.280 --> 02:53:17.180]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:53:17.300 --> 02:53:18.680]
I think that was what a dance to its boyfriend.

[02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:21.360]
5 and a local, this is 65.

[02:53:21.360 --> 02:53:22.420]
All is fine.

[02:53:22.720 --> 02:53:24.000]
The radio is all yours now.

[02:53:25.060 --> 02:53:25.720]
You ain't.

[02:53:26.500 --> 02:53:27.160]
Kid, baby.

[02:53:27.580 --> 02:53:30.000]
When no one is a writer, is it?

[02:53:30.260 --> 02:53:30.780]
Uh, yeah.

[02:53:31.580 --> 02:53:32.020]
Uh...

[02:53:32.020 --> 02:53:32.220]
Right.

[02:53:32.540 --> 02:53:38.360]
Okay. As part of your 480 hours community service, we have you scheduled to work at this soup kitchen.

[02:53:38.620 --> 02:53:39.380]
It's pretty easy.

[02:53:39.580 --> 02:53:42.000]
We make the food and then give it to whoever wanders in.

[02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:43.920]
So, uh, do you want to do the serving?

[02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:45.240]
Uh, no.

[02:53:45.560 --> 02:53:47.060]
I don't touch my own food.

[02:53:47.060 --> 02:53:48.940]
I'm certainly not touching anyone else's.

[02:53:49.180 --> 02:53:49.660]
Okay.

[02:53:50.260 --> 02:53:52.600]
Um, how about cooking in the back?

[02:53:52.920 --> 02:53:54.040]
No. No way.

[02:53:54.320 --> 02:53:55.820]
I'm allergic to stainless steel.

[02:53:56.080 --> 02:53:58.480]
Um, how about washing dishes?

[02:53:59.020 --> 02:53:59.660]
Okay, sure.

[02:54:00.200 --> 02:54:02.120]
The soup has cocoa butter and hohoba, right?

[02:54:02.320 --> 02:54:02.960]
Uh, no.

[02:54:03.180 --> 02:54:03.820]
Aloe vera?

[02:54:04.040 --> 02:54:04.660]
Uh, no.

[02:54:05.080 --> 02:54:08.200]
I guess that means you can't help with the rest of the cleaning either, huh?

[02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:09.660]
No, I got you covered there.

[02:54:09.660 --> 02:54:11.240]
Just give me a minute to call Rosa.

[02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:14.280]
She keeps my toilet so clean you can sit on them.

[02:54:14.380 --> 02:54:15.020]
Hi, yeah, great.

[02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:18.680]
But you see, you have to do the community service yourself.

[02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:19.240]
Oh.

[02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:21.680]
Well, I do have a list of supplies we need.

[02:54:21.940 --> 02:54:23.760]
Um, how good are you at shopping?

[02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:24.700]
A bet's me.

[02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:28.320]
Uh, well, wait, you need the credit card to pay.

[02:54:28.740 --> 02:54:29.260]
Don't worry.

[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:30.560]
I'll take care of it.

[02:54:31.260 --> 02:54:32.460]
Uh, this is great.

[02:54:32.740 --> 02:54:35.020]
1218 at 560 WQAM.

[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:36.060]
This is the best.

[02:54:36.340 --> 02:54:37.460]
But before we get to that facts,

[02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:41.240]
now this is our chronic radio nerd, you know,

[02:54:41.300 --> 02:54:42.900]
the one you can recognize by the title or land of.

[02:54:43.400 --> 02:54:44.520]
But at least this is worthwhile.

[02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:46.360]
It says,

[02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:48.480]
Mike Vineria was part of the Golden Age of Miami radio.

[02:54:48.840 --> 02:54:52.500]
WYOD during the 70s, 80s, 90s was the most entertaining radio station I've ever heard.

[02:54:53.240 --> 02:54:56.660]
I grew up listening to them during the 70s when they were known as the big entertainers with Mike Vineria,

[02:54:56.760 --> 02:54:58.100]
Big Wilson, Larry King and Bill Calder.

[02:54:58.480 --> 02:55:00.880]
Larry King now on CNN is the only one still alive.

[02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:03.960]
Believe it or not, Larry and Bill Calder had a very funny show.

[02:55:04.660 --> 02:55:06.160]
They did a, yeah, that's because Bill was funny.

[02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:06.700]
That's right.

[02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:09.940]
They did a segment called Man on the Street that was very funny radio.

[02:55:10.320 --> 02:55:12.800]
The station was the voice of the dolphin since the inception of the team.

[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:14.560]
Rick Weaver, the original play by playman,

[02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:16.980]
would Larry King and later Hank Goldberg provide in color.

[02:55:17.460 --> 02:55:19.880]
They were also the long time voice of the Miami Hurricanes,

[02:55:20.020 --> 02:55:21.420]
with Sunny Hersh and Tony Segredo,

[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:22.980]
and later Joe Zagaki.

[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:28.240]
And later Joe Zagaki.

[02:55:28.380 --> 02:55:28.980]
Oh, Mike!

[02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:32.760]
Neil Rogers came to the station in the late 80s

[02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:34.540]
and brought the station to greatness once again.

[02:55:34.540 --> 02:55:36.140]
Mike Vineria was Neil's lead in.

[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:37.400]
Oh, yes, those were the days.

[02:55:39.220 --> 02:55:40.380]
Steve King did afternoon drive.

[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:42.060]
Rick and Suds eventually replaced Steve.

[02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:43.860]
King went up to New York and failed miserably.

[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:45.980]
Rick and Suds eventually took over mornings

[02:55:45.980 --> 02:55:47.960]
and Phil Henry was brought in to do afternoon drive.

[02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:48.540]
Are you sure?

[02:55:48.820 --> 02:55:52.300]
Rick and Suds, Neil Rogers and Phil Henry provided some of the best radio ever heard.

[02:55:52.940 --> 02:55:53.580]
You hear that?

[02:55:54.280 --> 02:55:55.000]
I totally heard it.

[02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:55.620]
I knew his crap.

[02:55:56.020 --> 02:56:00.180]
Neil Rogers, Rick and Suds and Phil Henry provided some of the best radio ever heard.

[02:56:00.340 --> 02:56:04.300]
Not just like in this market, not just between such and such and such and other date.

[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:06.180]
A few years in,

[02:56:06.340 --> 02:56:08.960]
Paxson Communications Inc. bought the station and ran it into the ground.

[02:56:09.620 --> 02:56:12.520]
Paxson became clear channel on the station today as for the most part,

[02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:13.860]
Schlock Radio.

[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:15.900]
And you are...

[02:56:15.900 --> 02:56:17.300]
Absolutely correct.

[02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:23.360]
Much has syndicated crap with Dr. Laura and flushed in his right wing paranoia

[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:27.420]
and then flushed Junior, the Schmitt show, the most appropriately named show in history,

[02:56:28.580 --> 02:56:30.640]
with the Miss Grudge filling in every now and in,

[02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:32.660]
with Linda screening the calls.

[02:56:33.260 --> 02:56:36.200]
Somebody didn't hang up on Anne Coder, that would have been the best radio you would have done,

[02:56:36.300 --> 02:56:37.260]
Linda screening them calls.

[02:56:37.480 --> 02:56:38.500]
Should have hung up on that bitch.

[02:56:39.100 --> 02:56:40.860]
Now, here comes the facts of the year,

[02:56:41.060 --> 02:56:42.660]
but it's only January 6th.

[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:44.220]
You strapped in?

[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:49.520]
Now, didn't I only moments ago where we defact that said this was my last facts ever?

[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:51.540]
Well, we never hear from it again.

[02:56:52.060 --> 02:56:54.240]
Neil, nice tone of the show again.

[02:56:54.460 --> 02:56:55.680]
Tone underlined in Big Kevla.

[02:56:56.420 --> 02:56:59.200]
You start out calling me every name in the book, attacking me personally,

[02:56:59.300 --> 02:57:01.520]
and within an hour you're egging me on and taunting me more.

[02:57:02.340 --> 02:57:03.700]
In other words, he must still be listening.

[02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:07.160]
Have your fun today because this is the end.

[02:57:07.560 --> 02:57:13.600]
No more calls, no more facts is not one of these facts is that I contradict myself as far as how good your show has been lately.

[02:57:14.060 --> 02:57:15.120]
I still feel that way.

[02:57:15.720 --> 02:57:16.320]
Do we care?

[02:57:17.100 --> 02:57:17.380]
No.

[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:19.480]
What I'm saying is you're a prick.

[02:57:20.460 --> 02:57:22.140]
You don't worry about my prick, okay?

[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:23.520]
And I won't worry about yours, believe me.

[02:57:23.700 --> 02:57:26.260]
I always be a fan except now it'll be from afar.

[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:29.420]
By the way, I'd rather have a forerunner, what's it to you?

[02:57:29.420 --> 02:57:30.760]
He drives a forerunner.

[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:32.480]
You know what I just have to say to that?

[02:57:32.620 --> 02:57:34.260]
Oh my, oh my!

[02:57:35.020 --> 02:57:35.840]
Well, it was in there.

[02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:39.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:41.900]
You know what I really have to say to a guy that drives a forerunner is that.

[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:44.260]
How about her?

[02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:46.380]
How come we haven't heard her under radio lately, huh?

[02:57:47.340 --> 02:57:49.760]
All the great broadcasters that cheap channel is brought in.

[02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:52.760]
I'll never forget that day.

[02:57:53.420 --> 02:57:55.700]
After Paxton paid me off those seven months and I came back.

[02:57:55.700 --> 02:58:00.500]
In fact, no, it wasn't the day that I nearly got killed over there on the return bike and you came and picked me up and took me to the hospital.

[02:58:01.780 --> 02:58:03.120]
Well, I skidded out, didn't you remember that?

[02:58:03.240 --> 02:58:03.520]
Of course.

[02:58:03.700 --> 02:58:06.560]
No, it was before that because I wasn't actually had my check.

[02:58:07.060 --> 02:58:11.880]
See, that was Norma Kettigan being a really bad agent, making an arrangement where I had to go get a...

[02:58:11.880 --> 02:58:17.900]
I mean, granted I was getting paid for nothing, but why should I have a schlep down there and nearly got killed that one day to pick up a paycheck like they couldn't mail it on time?

[02:58:18.160 --> 02:58:20.840]
See, they were good like the beesleys or they had an excuse all the time.

[02:58:21.160 --> 02:58:23.440]
Oh, and a pony got sick and it got lost in the storm.

[02:58:24.160 --> 02:58:24.660]
What's the Omaha?

[02:58:24.660 --> 02:58:27.980]
Oh, you know that check that Muff personally mailed me last year?

[02:58:28.260 --> 02:58:30.040]
I mean, a year before that, still I've ever got there.

[02:58:30.760 --> 02:58:31.860]
Still hasn't got there yet.

[02:58:31.980 --> 02:58:32.940]
The one that I had to make a replace.

[02:58:34.280 --> 02:58:39.120]
So at any rate, I walked to the building, to the Paxton building, which it was in those days.

[02:58:39.780 --> 02:58:42.980]
And Fat Boy, I think, was there in some of the other...

[02:58:42.980 --> 02:58:43.800]
Yeah, he was out there.

[02:58:44.040 --> 02:58:45.500]
And they're all telling me, oh my God, have you heard?

[02:58:45.740 --> 02:58:46.180]
Heard what?

[02:58:46.540 --> 02:58:49.200]
Paxton is completely getting out of ready who sold it all out to Chief Channel.

[02:58:51.100 --> 02:58:51.860]
That was the day.

[02:58:52.840 --> 02:58:53.780]
Right down the street.

[02:58:53.880 --> 02:58:54.400]
Now who's down there?

[02:58:54.500 --> 02:58:55.800]
Have we got a kiss down there in that building?

[02:58:55.980 --> 02:58:56.160]
Yeah.

[02:58:56.680 --> 02:58:57.560]
Now why is that?

[02:58:58.040 --> 02:58:59.500]
Why is kissing a building with IOD?

[02:58:59.980 --> 02:59:01.940]
Well, everybody was leaving that other building over there.

[02:59:02.320 --> 02:59:05.600]
They had this building, the other building, the one that they're at the right hand,

[02:59:06.080 --> 02:59:07.100]
the company, the beesleys.

[02:59:08.300 --> 02:59:12.360]
But they were already into this long ass lease over here with this building.

[02:59:14.740 --> 02:59:15.140]
Yeah.

[02:59:17.060 --> 02:59:19.320]
So eventually, so I hear...

[02:59:19.320 --> 02:59:21.840]
Oh, in other words, what your time is that we could be working in that building?

[02:59:21.840 --> 02:59:23.200]
I know, they're real nice big building.

[02:59:23.360 --> 02:59:24.700]
All good real, but parking in that building.

[02:59:24.700 --> 02:59:24.700]

[02:59:24.820 --> 02:59:26.880]
What is a police building with all the red and blue?

[02:59:26.880 --> 02:59:27.320]
Well, that's okay.

[02:59:27.480 --> 02:59:29.640]
Greg would have turned it into a toilet in no time at all anyway.

[02:59:31.880 --> 02:59:36.620]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on EAT and T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:59:37.960 --> 02:59:38.560]
Here's Miami.

[02:59:38.680 --> 02:59:38.880]
Hello.

[02:59:39.300 --> 02:59:42.940]
Hey, a long time, Lister, I never call, but I also like Run Area a lot.

[02:59:43.120 --> 02:59:46.480]
And I thought it was exciting when you went over there the first time,

[02:59:46.620 --> 02:59:48.980]
you used to beat up on them.

[02:59:48.980 --> 02:59:52.840]
And then when you got over there, that first morning was fabulous to listen to Run Area.

[02:59:53.100 --> 02:59:55.880]
And he was just a peer gentleman and everything else.

[02:59:56.200 --> 02:59:58.860]
And I don't know, he was a great guy.

[02:59:59.160 --> 03:00:02.680]
So I'd like to call to say that and keep doing what you're doing now.

[03:00:02.680 --> 03:00:03.260]
Okay, thanks.

[03:00:03.780 --> 03:00:03.920]
See you.

[03:00:04.640 --> 03:00:08.240]
Another thing about Mike Boat, I tell you, he had the blue jacket that he used to wear.

[03:00:09.180 --> 03:00:11.020]
And the blue one, Brad.

[03:00:11.020 --> 03:00:12.060]
And also the red one.

[03:00:12.140 --> 03:00:13.160]
He had a blue jacket and a red jacket.

[03:00:13.220 --> 03:00:16.200]
And not a sports jacket, what I'm talking about, just a jacket, a windbreaker.

[03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:20.540]
And he would, in fact, a lot of days he would do it, the show,

[03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:22.260]
and they always do it with their jacket on?

[03:00:22.480 --> 03:00:22.760]
Typically.

[03:00:23.220 --> 03:00:23.680]
Yeah, usually.

[03:00:24.420 --> 03:00:27.300]
And when it would get to me 10 o'clock, he'd pack up his stuff.

[03:00:28.660 --> 03:00:29.900]
And that would be it.

[03:00:30.360 --> 03:00:33.680]
Didn't hang around, didn't cause a lot of trouble, which is why you see here.

[03:00:33.800 --> 03:00:36.260]
When a clock comes, I'm out the door within two minutes, tops.

[03:00:37.700 --> 03:00:40.320]
I'd be out a lot faster, except Miss Carlos out there at the front.

[03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:42.260]
She's always stopping at the reception desk.

[03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:45.480]
Friday, she's telling me about, oh, I guess what I'm going to go see tonight?

[03:00:45.480 --> 03:00:46.920]
I said, I can't even imagine.

[03:00:47.180 --> 03:00:49.680]
So Kochi Kochi, he goes to see Susan Lucci.

[03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:51.340]
I said, what the hell is she going to be doing?

[03:00:51.560 --> 03:00:51.980]
I was singing.

[03:00:52.200 --> 03:00:54.200]
I said, well, I'm glad she knew something because she sure can't act.

[03:00:55.420 --> 03:00:57.260]
Man, Carlos, I want to tell you seriously.

[03:00:57.660 --> 03:00:59.940]
If anybody in the world looks up the word, faggot in the dictionary,

[03:01:00.600 --> 03:01:01.260]
they'll see your picture.

[03:01:01.260 --> 03:01:04.780]
Well, when there's nothing wrong with it, but I'm just saying you are the definitive faggot.

[03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:08.820]
I mean, between Tammy Faye and Susan Lucci and Joan Crawford.

[03:01:09.060 --> 03:01:12.340]
And I'm sure Diana Ross and everybody, I mean, get with it.

[03:01:12.560 --> 03:01:13.380]
Don't forget Hello Kitty.

[03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:14.880]
Hello Kitty.

[03:01:16.020 --> 03:01:16.660]
What a pussy.

[03:01:18.440 --> 03:01:20.300]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:23.180]
That's what...

[03:01:23.180 --> 03:01:23.760]
Roar!

[03:01:23.860 --> 03:01:24.400]
...used to say.

[03:01:26.200 --> 03:01:27.280]
Here's Orlando. Hello.

[03:01:27.500 --> 03:01:28.040]
Hello, Neil.

[03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:28.600]
Yes, sir.

[03:01:28.860 --> 03:01:30.020]
All of us talk about Reneerie.

[03:01:30.080 --> 03:01:34.220]
This might be a little strange, but, you know, everybody's saying that, you know,

[03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:37.180]
how terrific talent he was and everything.

[03:01:37.280 --> 03:01:39.000]
No, they're not saying that they were saying he's a nice guy.

[03:01:39.300 --> 03:01:39.560]
Okay.

[03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:45.040]
Well, here's my threatened job to you, I mean, I've never called him a stuck-around.

[03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:46.200]
I've called a show a bunch of times.

[03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:46.860]
You're right ahead, sir.

[03:01:46.980 --> 03:01:48.320]
This is the show where suction is allowed.

[03:01:49.080 --> 03:01:49.440]
Micronerie.

[03:01:49.600 --> 03:01:52.260]
Can't hear people saying what a nice guy was and everything.

[03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:54.720]
I've been listening to you for 12 years.

[03:01:55.360 --> 03:01:57.800]
I'm gonna throw my radio in the garbage the day you're gone.

[03:01:58.100 --> 03:02:00.000]
I mean, radio is...

[03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:00.740]
Four years, man.

[03:02:00.900 --> 03:02:02.080]
At least I think it's gonna be four years.

[03:02:02.100 --> 03:02:02.960]
I'm thinking more like two.

[03:02:03.060 --> 03:02:03.980]
I think two years would be enough.

[03:02:04.460 --> 03:02:06.220]
But once you're gone, you can't hear it.

[03:02:06.240 --> 03:02:07.800]
What do you know, Georgia Smile?

[03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:08.560]
Why are you smiling?

[03:02:08.560 --> 03:02:10.780]
You think I'm really gonna be here four more years?

[03:02:11.500 --> 03:02:11.780]
Six.

[03:02:12.120 --> 03:02:12.400]
No.

[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:16.460]
And another thing that...

[03:02:16.460 --> 03:02:16.560]
Yeah.

[03:02:16.740 --> 03:02:20.760]
Real radio that you played about two years ago or two years, two months ago.

[03:02:21.020 --> 03:02:22.000]
You know, the archives.

[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:25.880]
You were talking about slush limbaugh a while ago.

[03:02:26.180 --> 03:02:26.400]
Yeah.

[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:28.580]
Did you hear him when he was already put down?

[03:02:28.580 --> 03:02:29.840]
I don't listen to him.

[03:02:30.120 --> 03:02:30.620]
No, no.

[03:02:30.760 --> 03:02:30.980]
Ever.

[03:02:31.580 --> 03:02:34.780]
When he chased his name, he's on there.

[03:02:34.940 --> 03:02:36.300]
It's KQV Pittsburgh.

[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:36.700]
Really?

[03:02:36.700 --> 03:02:40.860]
Goes by the name Jeff Christie, 1971.

[03:02:43.400 --> 03:02:43.720]
Okay.

[03:02:43.940 --> 03:02:45.560]
I wanted to call you and let you in on that.

[03:02:45.740 --> 03:02:46.400]
Thanks for the bad news.

[03:02:46.560 --> 03:02:47.700]
Okay, listen, have a great week.

[03:02:47.940 --> 03:02:48.360]
You two nail me.

[03:02:48.420 --> 03:02:49.040]
See you.

[03:02:50.180 --> 03:02:52.700]
You're actually thinking we're gonna be here at we another four years?

[03:02:53.400 --> 03:02:54.080]
See, you're just...

[03:02:54.080 --> 03:02:54.820]
You're taking your name boy.

[03:02:54.920 --> 03:02:56.440]
And that's a very interesting question.

[03:02:56.500 --> 03:02:57.620]
Maybe we'll do that as a poll tomorrow.

[03:02:58.320 --> 03:03:00.820]
What's George gonna do when he'll retire in a couple of years?

[03:03:01.880 --> 03:03:03.720]
I'm gonna work on that Afghani pipeline.

[03:03:03.960 --> 03:03:04.640]
No, I'm serious.

[03:03:04.820 --> 03:03:05.720]
What are you gonna do?

[03:03:06.260 --> 03:03:07.380]
I've been thinking about that.

[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:09.280]
I never bring it up because I'm afraid to say anything.

[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:11.600]
Because I don't know what kind of delusions of grandeur you've got.

[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:14.020]
Or maybe at that point you just dump the family and take off.

[03:03:14.060 --> 03:03:14.180]
That's not so personal.

[03:03:14.340 --> 03:03:14.460]
Yeah.

[03:03:15.300 --> 03:03:16.580]
It'd be a good excuse anyway.

[03:03:16.660 --> 03:03:17.160]
Move to the mountains.

[03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:18.380]
There you go.

[03:03:18.420 --> 03:03:20.240]
You got that place it's all paid for up there, right?

[03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:20.600]
Right.

[03:03:20.840 --> 03:03:21.260]
North Carolina.

[03:03:21.580 --> 03:03:22.460]
Be a tobacco farmer.

[03:03:22.680 --> 03:03:22.840]
Yeah.

[03:03:23.240 --> 03:03:24.780]
With a big traw on your mouth all the time.

[03:03:24.940 --> 03:03:25.340]
That sounds good.

[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:27.120]
Five, six.

[03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:28.560]
See, he's making a joke out of it.

[03:03:28.640 --> 03:03:31.720]
I'm trying to be a little bit concerned, a little bit humane here.

[03:03:31.900 --> 03:03:32.540]
I don't know.

[03:03:33.320 --> 03:03:34.980]
You think that they're gonna put you on the air here?

[03:03:34.980 --> 03:03:35.920]
Not these people know.

[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:37.620]
But somebody will.

[03:03:38.340 --> 03:03:38.760]
I reckon.

[03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:43.460]
There are people that are hacks that don't get the kind of numbers that I get even with the tapes.

[03:03:43.580 --> 03:03:45.260]
Well, the numbers that you get on this show.

[03:03:45.700 --> 03:03:45.840]
Yeah.

[03:03:46.200 --> 03:03:46.340]
See.

[03:03:46.500 --> 03:03:46.640]
I know.

[03:03:47.360 --> 03:03:49.360]
I understand a sound a little like the bird, you know.

[03:03:49.500 --> 03:03:51.660]
The numbers that you get on this show.

[03:03:51.840 --> 03:03:57.320]
You think for example, like if you were on W, we don't have any like on the light bulb.

[03:03:57.900 --> 03:03:59.360]
Look what happened or no seriously.

[03:03:59.480 --> 03:04:00.920]
They look what happened or reckon suds.

[03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:01.220]
I know.

[03:04:02.260 --> 03:04:04.700]
Me and Boca-Brine will put some tape out there.

[03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:06.320]
And, you know, we'll do something.

[03:04:06.860 --> 03:04:07.740]
I think what he's trying to say.

[03:04:07.940 --> 03:04:08.540]
What is this?

[03:04:09.320 --> 03:04:10.680]
Why did somebody fax me this?

[03:04:11.540 --> 03:04:11.860]
Comments.

[03:04:11.900 --> 03:04:14.000]
Lisa, here's my article I told you about.

[03:04:14.140 --> 03:04:14.800]
Why am I getting this?

[03:04:14.880 --> 03:04:15.740]
Is this the wrong number?

[03:04:16.100 --> 03:04:17.400]
Mill body fat and trim it, huh?

[03:04:17.920 --> 03:04:19.200]
Most of the facts that this is wrong number.

[03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:19.840]
I see.

[03:04:19.900 --> 03:04:20.720]
Oh, no, you know what?

[03:04:20.860 --> 03:04:21.720]
We're getting those a lot.

[03:04:21.900 --> 03:04:22.360]
What is this?

[03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:23.280]
It's a fake advertiser.

[03:04:23.320 --> 03:04:24.120]
Oh, it's another ad.

[03:04:24.320 --> 03:04:25.220]
Another fax ad.

[03:04:25.300 --> 03:04:26.200]
Man, do I hate those?

[03:04:26.460 --> 03:04:27.140]
Or what?

[03:04:27.700 --> 03:04:30.100]
Quit sending ads and mess it up by a fax machine.

[03:04:30.220 --> 03:04:30.700]
I hate that.

[03:04:32.320 --> 03:04:36.100]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[03:04:37.080 --> 03:04:38.300]
And, Verizon Wireless Line.

[03:04:38.780 --> 03:04:39.460]
It's a new year.

[03:04:39.600 --> 03:04:40.460]
I know what a lot of you are thinking.

[03:04:40.560 --> 03:04:41.620]
How did I gain all of this weight?

[03:04:41.720 --> 03:04:43.280]
How did I get so goddamn fat?

[03:04:44.120 --> 03:04:46.680]
Well, don't despair because with the Atkins low carb diet,

[03:04:46.820 --> 03:04:48.380]
those pounds can be gone before you can say,

[03:04:48.720 --> 03:04:49.680]
the lights of West Boca.

[03:04:50.020 --> 03:04:50.760]
Before you can say,

[03:04:50.800 --> 03:04:51.900]
PD Lenny is a douchebag.

[03:04:53.060 --> 03:04:55.220]
The lights of West Boca, a megastore for the Atkins.

[03:04:55.340 --> 03:04:57.740]
Oh, by the way, if Lyn is still listening, asshole.

[03:04:58.240 --> 03:04:59.600]
Well, see, I said PD Lenny so asshole.

[03:04:59.600 --> 03:05:01.300]
She loves that when I say that.

[03:05:02.380 --> 03:05:03.880]
And she also says, I have a dirty mind.

[03:05:04.320 --> 03:05:05.060]
I'm thinking about she-

[03:05:05.060 --> 03:05:07.720]
I never thought that you were doing anything with misgrudge, okay?

[03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:09.020]
Maybe they're doing a lesbian thing.

[03:05:10.200 --> 03:05:12.960]
The lights of West Boca is a megastore for the Atkins diet

[03:05:12.960 --> 03:05:14.200]
or any low carb sugar free diet.

[03:05:14.200 --> 03:05:15.080]
It's the place to shop.

[03:05:15.260 --> 03:05:17.140]
See, now she's going to think that I'm saying that she's a lesbian.

[03:05:17.660 --> 03:05:19.740]
I don't know what she is, and it's her business.

[03:05:19.900 --> 03:05:20.840]
What I'm trying to say is,

[03:05:21.280 --> 03:05:23.700]
they have over 600 delicious low carb food products

[03:05:23.700 --> 03:05:25.480]
like their new control carb chocolate,

[03:05:25.620 --> 03:05:26.900]
brownies, and four scrumptious flavors,

[03:05:27.260 --> 03:05:28.380]
and only one and a half carbs.

[03:05:28.380 --> 03:05:30.600]
So whether it's carbolide ice cream, bread,

[03:05:30.820 --> 03:05:33.240]
chips, muffins, cookies, cheesecakes, pasta sauces,

[03:05:33.580 --> 03:05:35.820]
the lights of West Boca is the place where all your Atkins needs

[03:05:35.820 --> 03:05:36.840]
and don't forget it delights.

[03:05:37.080 --> 03:05:38.480]
You can always try it before you buy it.

[03:05:38.540 --> 03:05:39.760]
You can always pop a little in your puss.

[03:05:40.180 --> 03:05:41.100]
They have unknowledgeable staff.

[03:05:41.340 --> 03:05:42.200]
They really know their crap.

[03:05:42.320 --> 03:05:44.000]
They open every day, seven days a week, 10 to 10.

[03:05:44.260 --> 03:05:46.380]
And they carry the most complete line of Atkins brand products

[03:05:46.380 --> 03:05:50.480]
that always 25% off all day, every day of your life.

[03:05:51.240 --> 03:05:52.880]
So by now you've heard the reports where the studies

[03:05:52.880 --> 03:05:54.580]

[03:05:54.580 --> 03:05:55.980]

[03:06:28.460 --> 03:06:32.580]
Now another chapter in the sweet-dickily-sleeve drawn out saga continues.

[03:06:33.520 --> 03:06:35.020]
The first one was great.

[03:06:35.340 --> 03:06:36.580]
The second one was...

[03:06:37.300 --> 03:06:39.760]
Okay, three, four, five basically bit to the lonely,

[03:06:39.900 --> 03:06:41.640]
but now pushing 16.

[03:06:41.980 --> 03:06:44.280]
So Vestor Stallone, the Italian stallion,

[03:06:44.520 --> 03:06:46.980]
comes off of dialysis for another battle.

[03:06:47.340 --> 03:06:48.960]
It's Rocky, six.

[03:06:50.140 --> 03:06:52.100]
I don't punch so hard number.

[03:06:52.880 --> 03:06:54.420]
My muscles is all...

[03:06:54.420 --> 03:06:55.080]
That's right, that's right.

[03:06:55.700 --> 03:06:56.500]
That's a pretty good...

[03:06:56.500 --> 03:06:57.360]
Rocky, six.

[03:06:58.240 --> 03:06:59.120]
Hey, I'm Paul.

[03:06:59.820 --> 03:07:00.520]
Apollo's dead.

[03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:01.160]
What?

[03:07:01.460 --> 03:07:01.620]
Really?

[03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:03.120]
Hey, Mick, is that true?

[03:07:03.460 --> 03:07:04.260]
I'm dead rock.

[03:07:04.600 --> 03:07:06.880]
Don't let that lift in brisk commercial fully, Rock.

[03:07:07.400 --> 03:07:09.460]
I never saw that lift in brisk commercial.

[03:07:09.740 --> 03:07:10.520]
You're in it, Rock.

[03:07:11.160 --> 03:07:11.600]
Andrea!

[03:08:18.880 --> 03:08:22.700]

[03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:50.500]
I think we took care of pretty much everything we need to take care of today

[03:08:51.320 --> 03:08:54.200]
You know, I was just telling Georgia like a real newspaper on their website

[03:08:54.980 --> 03:08:59.080]
They add on breaking news or stories that they didn't have in time for the morning edition

[03:08:59.080 --> 03:09:00.320]
They didn't find out about in time

[03:09:00.320 --> 03:09:03.040]
And so like you go to their website and they'll have some updated stories

[03:09:03.040 --> 03:09:08.340]
So I go to the Sun Central website during the break and I noticed there is one is this breaking story which you whatever the hell it is

[03:09:08.340 --> 03:09:09.900]

Here's a lady in bokeh hello

[03:10:17.700 --> 03:10:20.140]
Hi Neil, I didn't know I'd be in the stellar moment

[03:10:20.740 --> 03:10:24.460]
You know the asshole hour, but what can I tell you anyway?

[03:10:24.800 --> 03:10:28.980]
Micronary gosh, I was gonna have for a long time on WIO day and

[03:10:29.840 --> 03:10:33.660]
One of the best time I mean I just I love him

[03:10:33.660 --> 03:10:40.740]
But what the best time was when I he actually I want sky box tickets from I'm gonna go see the green bay game

[03:10:40.740 --> 03:10:43.620]
And it was just the best time in my life and

[03:10:45.500 --> 03:10:50.020]
I'm really sad to hear these passed on okay. Thanks for calling. Bye. See you

[03:10:50.680 --> 03:10:55.700]
Well, there's a nice lady. We haven't had too many ladies on a show today. Have we had any ladies? No couple not much

[03:10:56.680 --> 03:11:00.840]
The usual same stuff, but the thing that's alarming is taking a look at that pool with a Julio stations

[03:11:00.840 --> 03:11:06.760]
We have no Julios anymore. Maybe all of our Julios listen to a power. I don't think service is only nine. They got nine votes

[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:12.620]
Look at that radio. Rancies got none a.m. R's got one. I don't think they know one from the other one anyway

[03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:18.100]
Now we got no specs anymore. I think George drove them all away. We better start working real hard

[03:11:18.100 --> 03:11:19.700]
Maybe by reading that ad there from

[03:11:20.940 --> 03:11:25.620]
Direct TV or whatever was maybe the people that listen to those TV actually listening to those stations

[03:11:25.700 --> 03:11:29.340]
No, but the question is what's the best FM station in South Florida?

[03:11:30.080 --> 03:11:33.140]
We have plenty of people listen to the show who don't listen to the sports segments

[03:11:33.140 --> 03:11:38.680]
Or I mean do you listen to the same station all the time no in this town no god forbid

[03:11:41.600 --> 03:11:43.140]
Here's Lantana hello

[03:11:43.140 --> 03:11:50.700]

I'm sorry. I'm cracking up for that Reverend Jones. You know you idiot. He is very funny

[03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:15.680]
When it calls because he's just a moan

[03:12:16.300 --> 03:12:22.880]
I don't want to like ask if you were listening to Mike like in the last couple. We've heard him at all or no

[03:12:23.620 --> 03:12:28.280]
I mean he sounded bad the last I wanted to call when everybody was calling last time

[03:12:28.280 --> 03:12:30.580]
Same he sounded drunk on the air. Oh

[03:12:31.300 --> 03:12:36.740]
But it's the same that he died. Well, doesn't that make you feel bad though now while calling and saying that?

[03:12:36.740 --> 03:12:41.360]
Yeah, we know yeah, sorry. Don't make you feel like crap. No, I mean I like them

[03:12:41.360 --> 03:12:46.020]
I just you know he really did sound like I understand what you're saying

[03:12:46.020 --> 03:12:48.420]
I don't know whether he had a stroke or what the deal was there at the end

[03:12:48.420 --> 03:12:52.520]
But doesn't make you feel like useless and like a real scumbag having called and said that

[03:12:53.620 --> 03:12:57.120]
I'm not trying to make you feel any worse, but yeah

[03:12:58.400 --> 03:13:01.320]

Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[03:13:06.780 --> 03:13:09.200]
Hello, Neil. I was listening to your show and

[03:13:10.160 --> 03:13:17.780]
I've been listening to Mike Reney for many many years. I was wondering if you would certainly know there used to be a lady on

[03:13:17.780 --> 03:13:21.100]
On the radio with Mike Reney named Sandy Casey

[03:13:21.100 --> 03:13:27.780]
Yeah, was apparently I got the impression they're very good friends. I was just wondering if you'd heard anything from her

[03:13:27.780 --> 03:13:33.180]
I'm her I got no idea. I think she ran off in her pickup truck with ambitious body is what we heard

[03:13:35.200 --> 03:13:38.080]
Well good. I'm here anymore. That's all I can tell you

[03:13:38.080 --> 03:13:41.440]
She wasn't one of my favorite people she was not no

[03:13:42.200 --> 03:13:45.400]
And in addition to what's now that you mentioned her name other than Mike

[03:13:45.400 --> 03:13:49.940]
She didn't have any friends inside that building may she was another one that put on a real good air on on the radio

[03:13:49.940 --> 03:13:53.120]
You know like goody two shoes and inside the building may hit it or like poison

[03:13:53.120 --> 03:13:59.920]
Well, that's interesting. All right. Well, thanks very much. Okay, and have a great day. Thank you five six seven oh five sixty

[03:14:19.220 --> 03:14:25.120]
Kind of devastated by the news about Mike Reney. He was like a very reassuring voice in the morning

You know the old timers. Yeah, seemed to be kind of just fading and fading off and I hope you're keeping away from those white hearts

[03:14:32.860 --> 03:14:34.520]
And I hope you stick around for a long time

[03:14:34.520 --> 03:14:38.780]

He always like leaves the opening for me to you know

[03:14:43.820 --> 03:14:48.280]

So anyway, my dog is bragging the ordinary cart there

[03:18:07.660 --> 03:18:09.660]
By the way, put the recorder in the slot on the way out

[03:18:10.960 --> 03:18:11.560]
Where's he going to play?

[03:18:12.220 --> 03:18:12.820]
Likewise, I bring your pardon

[03:18:13.760 --> 03:18:15.060]
I don't know when they're going to play it

[03:18:15.060 --> 03:18:16.760]
They'll play it when he feels good and ready to play it

[03:18:16.760 --> 03:18:18.760]
I'm loaning that out to our good close personal friend

[03:18:18.760 --> 03:18:20.160]
The mad dog who's you know

[03:18:20.160 --> 03:18:22.580]
So at least we can do for him to try to bring him back

[03:18:22.580 --> 03:18:23.900]
He looks a little bit better today

[03:18:23.900 --> 03:18:25.920]
Last week he was really down from last uh

[03:18:25.920 --> 03:18:27.600]
Last Sunday's game that often lost

[03:18:27.600 --> 03:18:28.540]
They choked you up

[03:18:28.920 --> 03:18:30.080]
And of course Friday night

[03:18:30.080 --> 03:18:31.860]
Of course he went to Michigan and they you know

[03:18:31.860 --> 03:18:34.020]
They wonder a game so he's not going to take the U.M. game seriously

[03:18:34.020 --> 03:18:36.000]
As he might claim he won't

[03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:39.400]

[03:18:39.400 --> 03:18:41.600]
Pound 560 on the AT&T line

[03:18:41.600 --> 03:18:42.780]
Fort Lauderdale hello

[03:18:42.780 --> 03:18:43.940]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[03:18:44.040 --> 03:18:44.920]
I'm doing good

[03:18:44.920 --> 03:18:48.600]
Hey uh just a couple of ordinary memories when I was a kid growing up

[03:18:48.600 --> 03:18:50.020]
You used to answer the phone

[03:18:50.420 --> 03:18:51.920]
Called a ordinary good morning

[03:18:52.480 --> 03:18:53.940]
And it just brought back some memories

[03:18:53.940 --> 03:18:56.720]
And then the other one was his restaurant down in South Dave

[03:18:56.720 --> 03:18:58.360]
We used to go there as a family and eat a lot

[03:18:58.360 --> 03:18:59.260]
Oh yeah right

[03:18:59.880 --> 03:19:01.520]
Yeah so he forgot about that

[03:19:01.520 --> 03:19:03.940]
Yeah Mike was a good guy as a kid growing up

[03:19:03.940 --> 03:19:05.520]
When he was in the restaurant we were there

[03:19:05.520 --> 03:19:06.700]
You would always come over and say hello

[03:19:06.700 --> 03:19:08.420]
And he was a good guy and uh

[03:19:08.420 --> 03:19:10.580]
And closing, we'll listen to George's uh

[03:19:10.580 --> 03:19:12.860]
We're out of every station he's on, whenever he comes on

[03:19:12.860 --> 03:19:14.840]
There you go, there's a vote for a George

[03:19:14.840 --> 03:19:15.780]
Thanks a lot Neil

[03:19:15.780 --> 03:19:17.280]
And thank you George says

[03:19:17.280 --> 03:19:18.500]
Good morning regards to Broadway

[03:19:19.920 --> 03:19:21.820]
See there's a start you gotta start with one

[03:19:21.820 --> 03:19:22.940]
That's what we do on this station

[03:19:22.940 --> 03:19:24.400]
Of course we're waiting for them billboards

[03:19:24.400 --> 03:19:26.660]
And all the other big promotion from the beastly people

[03:19:26.660 --> 03:19:28.300]
That's coming, that's what Greg says

[03:19:28.300 --> 03:19:28.860]
It's coming

[03:19:30.460 --> 03:19:31.760]

Yeah man it looks a little bit better today

[03:19:39.260 --> 03:19:40.880]
Fry boy he looked Thursday and Friday

[03:19:40.880 --> 03:19:42.880]
Like hell boy over

[03:19:43.360 --> 03:19:44.540]
From that dolphin loss

[03:19:44.540 --> 03:19:46.380]
Seriously he came in here last Thursday

[03:19:46.380 --> 03:19:48.080]
And he looked during the break where you know

[03:19:48.080 --> 03:19:50.480]
Bonding a little bit hadn't seen him for a month or two

[03:19:50.480 --> 03:19:51.680]
Have a little chat

[03:19:52.400 --> 03:19:55.480]
And he's asking me to analyze why the dolphins choked

[03:19:55.480 --> 03:19:57.440]
And how they fell apart and lost that game in New England

[03:19:57.440 --> 03:19:59.820]
And of course I'm sitting here with my Tom Brady picture

[03:19:59.820 --> 03:20:01.380]
On my thing here

[03:20:04.620 --> 03:20:05.820]
On my thing

[03:20:08.060 --> 03:20:10.260]
Here's a lady from somewhere is this Palm Beach

[03:20:10.260 --> 03:20:12.400]
I'm kind of lost here's a Palm Beach hello

[03:20:12.400 --> 03:20:13.680]
Hey Neil how you doing?

[03:20:13.740 --> 03:20:14.220]
Okay sir

[03:20:14.220 --> 03:20:16.600]
Long time listener I haven't called you in a long time

[03:20:17.840 --> 03:20:21.800]
And I wanted to throw my two cents in on my favorite radio station

[03:20:21.800 --> 03:20:23.740]
Since I can't get to my computer for a while

[03:20:23.740 --> 03:20:24.100]
Okay

[03:20:24.100 --> 03:20:29.620]
I like mpr aside from you and the Panther broadcast radio down here is the fifth

[03:20:30.780 --> 03:20:31.380]
Okay

[03:20:31.380 --> 03:20:33.820]
I like mpr because I played jazz at night

[03:20:33.820 --> 03:20:35.240]
There you go

[03:20:35.240 --> 03:20:39.540]
It's the only station that plays jazz you got elevator music on love

[03:20:39.540 --> 03:20:42.460]
And just a little time that you know

[03:20:42.460 --> 03:20:43.180]
Okay thanks

[03:20:43.180 --> 03:20:44.320]
Great everything else stinks

[03:20:44.320 --> 03:20:45.460]
Okay thanks

[03:20:47.880 --> 03:20:49.760]
Everything stinks folks okay

[03:20:49.760 --> 03:20:51.200]
Can you smell it

[03:20:54.100 --> 03:20:55.520]
Here's a call from Jupiter hello

[03:20:55.520 --> 03:20:58.360]
I don't get it man in here Jeff the two games away from the Super Bowl

[03:20:58.360 --> 03:20:59.760]
You guys are talking about your crap

[03:20:59.760 --> 03:21:00.780]
Good excellent

[03:21:01.240 --> 03:21:03.780]
Because we don't care about the jets or the Super Bowl on this show

[03:21:03.780 --> 03:21:05.700]
How do you like that? Go and in fact go to Columbus

[03:21:05.700 --> 03:21:08.380]
You can hang out with those kids and maybe they'll let you in their dorm but I doubt it

[03:21:09.340 --> 03:21:10.860]
It sounds like a pervert to me

[03:21:11.840 --> 03:21:13.600]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[03:21:13.600 --> 03:21:16.620]
Pound 5 60 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[03:21:16.620 --> 03:21:18.240]
Here's Miami hello

[03:21:18.780 --> 03:21:19.140]
Neil

[03:21:19.140 --> 03:21:19.780]
Yes sir

[03:21:21.680 --> 03:21:26.140]
I've been I've lived in Miami since I was 14 I'm 48 now

[03:21:26.140 --> 03:21:26.820]
I'm so sorry

[03:21:28.100 --> 03:21:29.580]
Yeah, I pray for me

[03:21:29.580 --> 03:21:33.620]
But hearing about Mike I was just reminiscing

[03:21:33.620 --> 03:21:39.640]
What I've been doing all morning is thinking about some of the really good things about this town

[03:21:39.640 --> 03:21:41.360]
And the area that have passed

[03:21:41.360 --> 03:21:45.600]
That my kids are never going to see or hear it's kind of sad

[03:21:45.600 --> 03:21:47.740]
You know so just sadness

[03:21:48.600 --> 03:21:52.920]
Is it true what you were saying about Henry Barrow and what he did to Mike?

[03:21:53.140 --> 03:21:53.420]
Yes

[03:21:55.600 --> 03:22:02.960]
You probably won't play it but I'm going to all just close by saying that it's going to take probably forever for that taste and smell to get out of his town

[03:22:03.780 --> 03:22:04.220]
Okay

[03:22:04.900 --> 03:22:07.800]
How would you say it's all right? Why don't I play that?

[03:22:08.380 --> 03:22:09.860]
You know the one he's talking about?

[03:22:09.860 --> 03:22:11.320]
Yep, where Henry says

[03:22:11.320 --> 03:22:15.540]
Takes forever to get that taste and smell out of your system

[03:22:15.540 --> 03:22:17.520]
Yeah, that's what Mark Benson said too

[03:22:18.400 --> 03:22:20.500]
Now maybe that smell was in another language

[03:22:20.500 --> 03:22:22.440]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[03:22:22.440 --> 03:22:26.280]
Oh listen he was like owning a shaded way from Amy Schaeffer as far as his psychosis

[03:22:26.280 --> 03:22:27.900]
And also Enes de Pina Shira

[03:22:27.900 --> 03:22:30.000]
All these good names are coming back to me now

[03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:32.340]
From those citizens of the United days

[03:22:34.580 --> 03:22:38.020]
Although I don't know why I'm picking on them now because all of our fix they've all disappeared

[03:22:38.020 --> 03:22:39.240]
Nice going George

[03:22:39.920 --> 03:22:42.700]
Whatever you do you get your next show don't get it on a spick station

[03:22:44.100 --> 03:22:45.820]
Okay, here's Fort Lauderdale, hello

[03:22:46.600 --> 03:22:49.840]
Yeah, he was fairly entertaining like for an area on the radio

[03:22:49.840 --> 03:22:52.600]
But shouldn't you really call it the Stephen Wiz and Paul Center?

[03:22:52.900 --> 03:22:56.020]
Because you know another Nazi that did was there a more anti-Semitic

[03:22:58.240 --> 03:23:00.460]
Oh brother, what is this man talking about?

[03:23:01.820 --> 03:23:07.560]
5 6 7 0 you know some of you people are so sick that it's just amazing to me that you can get out of bed in the morning and look in the mirror

[03:23:08.080 --> 03:23:10.540]
Maybe they just maybe they shave blind maybe they don't shave

[03:23:11.560 --> 03:23:13.080]
Maybe they have somebody shave them

[03:23:16.600 --> 03:23:17.560]
Here's Miramar, hello

[03:23:18.460 --> 03:23:22.640]
Leo, listen about this micro-nary and you mentioned he had a red cross down in Miami

[03:23:22.640 --> 03:23:26.760]
Is this the same one that had one there in Hollywood on the corner of Hollywood Boulevard?

[03:23:26.760 --> 03:23:29.960]
That was Rene Rio's it wasn't the same thing

[03:23:29.960 --> 03:23:30.800]
Oh okay

[03:23:30.800 --> 03:23:35.700]
That was the guy who started the Bokkerberger thing had that Rene Rio's I remember what his name was

[03:23:35.700 --> 03:23:39.120]
Oh okay, I was just wondering because I used to go over there a whole lot to eat

[03:23:39.500 --> 03:23:40.800]
And I was just wondering about it

[03:23:40.800 --> 03:23:42.340]
Is that place gone?

[03:23:42.980 --> 03:23:43.660]
No it's still there

[03:23:44.700 --> 03:23:48.380]
Okay thanks, what was his name? Do you remember the guy with the Bokkerberger's?

[03:23:48.520 --> 03:23:51.380]
Chef Chorts, whatever he was

[03:23:52.760 --> 03:23:53.040]
Wow

[03:23:53.480 --> 03:23:54.540]
You know what I'm talking about?

[03:23:54.660 --> 03:23:57.460]
Yeah, he came by, he's doing films now, he gave me his card

[03:23:57.460 --> 03:23:58.560]
Really? One of these appearances

[03:23:59.300 --> 03:24:01.860]
So there you go folks, I'm the guy to put all the workers on the map

[03:24:01.860 --> 03:24:03.740]
Chef Ronaldo, very good, he was a good guy

[03:24:05.200 --> 03:24:07.880]
And boy I'll tell you we really made that Bokkerberger thing

[03:24:07.880 --> 03:24:10.780]
But where's my check? You know if the Bokkerberger people would send me a check?

[03:24:10.940 --> 03:24:11.880]
A couple million

[03:24:14.200 --> 03:24:15.180]
Big old bites

[03:24:15.960 --> 03:24:17.460]
Ben and Jerry's

[03:24:18.020 --> 03:24:18.820]
Fish food

[03:24:19.740 --> 03:24:23.440]
You know if each of these organizations would send me what I have coming you know like

[03:24:23.440 --> 03:24:25.340]
Half a million here, a couple of million there

[03:24:25.340 --> 03:24:31.580]
I just let Chorts take over to show tomorrow, I'll say okay here you go baby hand in the keys over to you

[03:24:32.780 --> 03:24:34.740]
Now you think they might change the lock by Wednesday?

[03:24:36.740 --> 03:24:38.060]
Here's Pemberpine, hello?

[03:24:38.720 --> 03:24:40.080]
What's that Bokkerberger?

[03:24:44.420 --> 03:24:45.720]
Here's plantation, hello

[03:24:46.760 --> 03:24:47.500]
Uncle Neil

[03:24:47.500 --> 03:24:48.160]
Yes sir

[03:24:48.960 --> 03:24:53.200]
Did the Sunset and all the advertised the adepth of the...

[03:24:53.200 --> 03:24:55.320]
Did they advertise it? I mean did they announce it?

[03:24:55.360 --> 03:24:56.140]
I'm sorry, I know

[03:24:56.140 --> 03:24:56.900]
No they did not

[03:24:57.580 --> 03:24:58.120]
Not even today?

[03:24:58.380 --> 03:24:58.660]
No

[03:24:59.320 --> 03:25:01.980]
Did the Bound to Smith, kept the Bound to check in? No

[03:25:02.440 --> 03:25:03.080]
That bomb

[03:25:04.080 --> 03:25:05.260]
Alright, have a go with me

[03:25:05.260 --> 03:25:10.240]
Okay, like I said I checked and maybe I missed it if I missed it I apologize profusely

[03:25:10.240 --> 03:25:13.600]
But we got too many people listening to the show and if they would have headed in there over the weekend

[03:25:13.940 --> 03:25:17.260]
Certainly they don't have it today because I got my Sunset and my wife's basket here right now

[03:25:17.860 --> 03:25:20.320]
And I scoured it from cover to cover from pillar to post

[03:25:20.320 --> 03:25:22.660]
Maybe it's on the... I don't know

[03:25:23.560 --> 03:25:24.200]
What do you think?

[03:25:25.220 --> 03:25:25.900]
I doubt it

[03:25:29.620 --> 03:25:35.420]
Maybe it's on the inside front page, you know that sometimes on page two they have things like that

[03:25:36.480 --> 03:25:37.340]
Let me take a look

[03:25:37.340 --> 03:25:42.000]
Because I don't want to be ripping them and ass then fight out that it was in there and you know look more stupid than I usually do

[03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:42.920]
I don't see it

[03:25:42.920 --> 03:25:46.160]
I see Carl Gustav, the Swedish king

[03:25:46.620 --> 03:25:50.160]
I see George Clooney, which quite frankly if I see him again it'll be too soon

[03:25:50.160 --> 03:25:54.480]
I see Camille Parker-Bulls at Prince Charles with that ugly obnoxious push of his

[03:25:54.480 --> 03:25:55.920]
I don't see nothing about Mikey

[03:25:57.860 --> 03:25:59.020]
There's Tom Jicca

[03:26:00.720 --> 03:26:03.280]
Really on top of things baby, you're really doing it, not

[03:26:05.560 --> 03:26:07.960]
Here's a call from Miami, hello

[03:26:10.660 --> 03:26:16.180]
I just wanted to tell you that I worked with both UN-likey many many many years ago

[03:26:17.760 --> 03:26:21.160]
And I will never forget I was also with the Grand Prix

[03:26:21.620 --> 03:26:27.580]
And I had the pleasure of driving Mike on a paste car ride that was so bad he almost pooped his pants

[03:26:27.580 --> 03:26:28.880]
The guy was incredible

[03:26:28.880 --> 03:26:34.880]
He really understood what cool radio was all about and making people happy in the morning

[03:26:34.880 --> 03:26:39.520]
And I'm really going to miss him and thanks for studying on the area yourself, kiddo

[03:26:39.520 --> 03:26:40.300]
Okay, thanks a lot

[03:26:40.900 --> 03:26:43.740]
Speaking of that, you know I the first time I ever met Mike Rineri

[03:26:43.740 --> 03:26:46.620]
I was working at WKAT and he was an IOD

[03:26:47.600 --> 03:26:50.460]
So I was like in the little leagues to say I just come to the market

[03:26:50.900 --> 03:26:56.340]
And we both had the same sponsors, some kind of a carpeting company, something like that

[03:26:56.340 --> 03:27:02.260]
And I don't know how it worked out but the agency arranged for us both to be there to meet with the company at the same time

[03:27:03.540 --> 03:27:06.100]
And here I'm working at KAT and he was at IOD

[03:27:06.100 --> 03:27:10.380]
And he was just as nice to me as if we were on the same radio station, how do you like that?

[03:27:12.440 --> 03:27:16.600]
Which is quite quite different when you consider the fact that I'm working on the same radio station with Mike Rineri

[03:27:16.600 --> 03:27:19.880]
And with certain other people, I don't want to mention any names or singular name

[03:27:20.800 --> 03:27:21.600]
See the difference?

[03:27:22.160 --> 03:27:24.340]
Oh yeah, when you're supposed to be part of a team

[03:27:25.200 --> 03:27:27.760]
With psychotic, neurotic people with bad barricose veins

[03:27:28.620 --> 03:27:31.020]
And crappy wigs that keep falling off the one side

[03:27:31.020 --> 03:27:34.300]
That's what Mad Dog said during the game last Sunday that it completely fell off

[03:27:34.740 --> 03:27:36.000]
That's what we just told him, did you hear that?

[03:27:36.580 --> 03:27:37.360]
That's what he said

[03:27:38.200 --> 03:27:39.220]
Drop right on the floor

[03:27:39.980 --> 03:27:40.940]
Here's Hollywood, hello

[03:27:40.940 --> 03:27:41.920]
Hello, Nia

[03:27:41.920 --> 03:27:42.280]
Yes sir

[03:27:42.280 --> 03:27:43.700]
Hey, how you doing?

[03:27:44.380 --> 03:27:46.100]
Listen, can you play a request?

[03:27:46.660 --> 03:27:46.960]
Are you there?

[03:27:47.380 --> 03:27:48.140]
Maybe, possible

[03:27:48.680 --> 03:27:53.140]
It's my old grandfather, he's 90 years old, that old Jaime I told

[03:27:53.140 --> 03:27:58.300]
He wanted to hear sitting on a bus, sitting on a bench in Del Rey

[03:27:58.300 --> 03:28:01.220]
It's been so long since you played that, I forgot the name of it

[03:28:01.920 --> 03:28:03.960]
Yeah, it's been so long since I played it

[03:28:03.960 --> 03:28:04.940]
It's been a long time

[03:28:04.940 --> 03:28:06.240]
It sounds like it's playing now

[03:28:06.240 --> 03:28:08.020]
Okay, Nia, I love you so

[03:28:08.020 --> 03:28:10.200]
I don't have to stay right now

[03:28:10.200 --> 03:28:12.180]
Don't step on the bed, get out of here already

[03:28:12.180 --> 03:28:14.880]
My wife took their card or the mall

[03:28:15.900 --> 03:28:19.420]
She drives my viewer again, she's three feet tall

[03:28:20.900 --> 03:28:23.780]
I wouldn't ride with her no way

[03:28:24.840 --> 03:28:28.200]
I said I'd need it and later today

[03:28:28.200 --> 03:28:32.880]
So I'm just sitting on a bench in Del Rey

[03:28:33.740 --> 03:28:37.140]
Waiting for the early bus to take me away

[03:28:37.140 --> 03:28:41.800]
Only I'm just sitting on a bench in Del Rey

[03:28:41.800 --> 03:28:44.560]
With my friend Jaime

[03:28:48.860 --> 03:28:52.700]
Looks like it's time to check my chains

[03:28:52.700 --> 03:28:56.700]
First of all, Sators don't always stay the same

[03:28:56.700 --> 03:29:01.140]
All that God would do what Genneth tells me to do

[03:29:01.840 --> 03:29:05.240]
The private high-rides keep us being sane

[03:29:05.240 --> 03:29:09.160]
Just sitting here resting my bones

[03:29:10.020 --> 03:29:13.120]
Wondering why my wife won't leave me alone

[03:29:14.160 --> 03:29:17.500]
We've talked it over that I never went

[03:29:18.500 --> 03:29:22.480]
I just wind up schlepping through the mall again

[03:29:22.480 --> 03:29:26.500]
Oi, so I sit on a bench in Del Rey

[03:29:27.360 --> 03:29:31.060]
Waiting for the early bus to take me away

[03:29:31.680 --> 03:29:35.560]
Oi, so I sit on a bench in Del Rey

[03:29:35.560 --> 03:29:39.520]
With my friend Jaime

[03:29:39.520 --> 03:29:43.760]
There he is, about ten times

[03:29:43.760 --> 03:29:45.940]
I've been waiting the old damn day in this bitch

[03:29:45.940 --> 03:29:47.340]
For the hell of you bitch

[03:29:47.340 --> 03:29:52.540]
I will always go and stop the pack you smartly

[03:29:52.540 --> 03:29:54.560]
Profit the 8 and 5, 60 WID

[03:29:54.560 --> 03:29:56.540]
I'm just thinking about it because when Mandage came in

[03:29:56.540 --> 03:29:59.260]
And I loaned him that card with the Renerio theme on it

[03:29:59.920 --> 03:30:03.140]
Most of us on his station, in fact, especially when Diffo was here in the morning

[03:30:03.140 --> 03:30:04.680]
Before we got what we got now

[03:30:05.360 --> 03:30:07.120]
Almost all of us worked at our D-together

[03:30:07.120 --> 03:30:07.760]
Right

[03:30:08.620 --> 03:30:11.400]
Yours truly and Hank and Mad Dog

[03:30:11.400 --> 03:30:13.300]
And we knew that, Durban Diffo

[03:30:13.300 --> 03:30:15.020]
Yeah, Kimbo

[03:30:15.480 --> 03:30:16.660]
Kimbo, there you go

[03:30:17.660 --> 03:30:19.240]
Anybody else did you say Josie?

[03:30:19.960 --> 03:30:20.580]
And of course

[03:30:21.100 --> 03:30:21.860]
Joseph Gatti

[03:30:21.860 --> 03:30:22.840]
Yeah, him too

[03:30:24.140 --> 03:30:25.140]
Shocking, you know, amazing

[03:30:26.860 --> 03:30:28.280]
Here's a call from Miami, hello

[03:30:30.340 --> 03:30:31.360]
Miami, Buenos dias

[03:30:31.800 --> 03:30:32.200]
Hello

[03:30:32.200 --> 03:30:33.200]
Yes sir

[03:30:33.200 --> 03:30:35.760]
I think I know where all your billboards are

[03:30:35.760 --> 03:30:37.360]
You need to hire a G-pose agent

[03:30:37.360 --> 03:30:39.560]
Because he has billboards up on 9.95

[03:30:39.560 --> 03:30:40.880]
Yeah, we know that

[03:30:40.880 --> 03:30:43.660]
He sent him for a long time

[03:30:44.820 --> 03:30:46.200]
Lady, hire an agent

[03:30:47.380 --> 03:30:48.180]
Okay, thanks

[03:30:48.180 --> 03:30:50.000]
Yeah, let's hire a D-pose agent, huh

[03:30:50.000 --> 03:30:53.460]
Or at least get the hold of some of his friends with the Indians, that might do it

[03:30:54.080 --> 03:30:56.960]
But we got the big billboard campaign this month, isn't that what we heard?

[03:30:57.260 --> 03:30:58.440]
You know what they told us, huh?

[03:30:59.540 --> 03:31:01.140]
And as I told Norma Kent yesterday

[03:31:01.140 --> 03:31:02.760]
I'll believe it when I see it

[03:31:02.760 --> 03:31:05.060]
When I see the very first one, I don't want to hear about it

[03:31:05.060 --> 03:31:07.880]
I don't want to see pictures of it, I want to see it with my own eye

[03:31:08.480 --> 03:31:11.200]
Okay, I want to leave my eye right on it like Colombo

[03:31:11.760 --> 03:31:13.040]
And spy it for myself

[03:31:13.040 --> 03:31:14.780]
But that's the way it is here at QAM

[03:31:14.780 --> 03:31:16.980]
They talk a good game and they lie

[03:31:16.980 --> 03:31:19.260]
And they lie and they promise

[03:31:19.260 --> 03:31:21.440]
And they lie, but you know something that checks do clear

[03:31:22.080 --> 03:31:23.800]
Sometimes it's a little bit of a hassle getting them

[03:31:23.800 --> 03:31:25.780]
But once you wrestle them out of their hands

[03:31:27.140 --> 03:31:31.240]
But the good news is, Clarence said he and the beast had a really good time out there together in the Novakus

[03:31:31.240 --> 03:31:33.000]
Or in where now, in the Arizona-Tempi

[03:31:33.380 --> 03:31:35.140]
He said they took a good tempi together

[03:31:36.700 --> 03:31:38.540]
He said he's not really sure what he hit

[03:31:38.540 --> 03:31:40.160]
But he said it was like somewhere in the folds

[03:31:41.060 --> 03:31:42.540]
When they were like doing their thing

[03:31:42.540 --> 03:31:44.660]
He said not exactly sure where he buried it

[03:31:44.660 --> 03:31:46.200]
But we're like somewhere in the folds somewhere

[03:31:46.200 --> 03:31:48.440]
Anyway, the mad dogs, the mad dogs coming up next

[03:31:48.440 --> 03:31:51.020]
We got the humpback from vacation from Shulahsett 3

[03:31:51.020 --> 03:31:53.180]
The big O at O 7

[03:31:53.180 --> 03:31:57.840]
80k at 10 and Jo and Mark back from their honeymoon together at the 2-6 and a more

[03:31:57.840 --> 03:31:58.860]
Bye bye bye

[03:31:58.860 --> 03:32:02.300]
The new Roger Show on 560s on QAM

[03:32:02.300 --> 03:32:03.460]
Might be for Larday

[03:32:03.460 --> 03:32:04.380]
Where's the ladies room?
