[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740]
Hey, by the way, Moe quit sucking around Joe. He says you don't want no party. He hates you like poison

[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.700]
But I'm listening

[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.380]
Hey, Moe, Joe hates you like poison

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.940]

[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.220]
Contact you

[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:56.940]
Row in my life. You said it's world potato

[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.900]
Because I've been looking around

[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.160]
When excuse to explain my words

[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.380]
Hey

[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.600]
You can't recognize me

[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.380]
Hey, great

[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.980]
My daughters have leached out my endless need

[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.160]
And I keep children around

[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.840]
And they sleep inside my bed

[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.080]
Are you sure?

[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.100]
People say that I am gay

[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.220]
That is why I marry you

[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.420]
Some are really

[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.660]
It's great to wait to come and take

[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.020]
With this song

[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.860]
That's really bad

[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.120]
Blame it on my child

[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.280]
You've turned out all those toys

[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.260]
That I never had

[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.640]
The only chance I show in my life

[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.440]
With my children and I'm using them

[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.620]
Before you judge me

[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.140]
And call me free

[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.380]
Let me find and hug

[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.200]
And say

[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.560]
Let's go, Muria, look at me

[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.720]
I blame it on my child

[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.800]
That damn fat guy, I can't stand it

[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.560]
10-03-560 WQM Happy Wednesday to you

[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.180]
Boy, I'm going to tell you there are certain little group of people

[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.180]
Without whom we'd never have anything to talk about

[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.620]
You know what?

[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.700]
Yeah

[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.380]
We didn't have Boza to clown there as president

[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.600]
Who just made that embarrassing speech in London

[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.120]
To a fixed house

[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.880]
If we didn't have Michael

[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.600]
Michael

[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.360]
Talk about

[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.500]
We didn't have Rosio Dona

[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.820]
Right, there's only about like 10 people

[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.840]
It's always been this way

[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.960]
Our good friend Howard

[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.940]
I didn't know which Howard you were talking about

[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.180]
And then of course

[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.260]
Don't forget

[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.160]
Recent

[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.260]
Helmines

[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.120]
Helmines

[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.040]
Okay, that's enough for you, Rach. Good on you.

[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.900]
Small potatoes

[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.700]
Michael Jackson reportedly sought for arrest on child molestation charges

[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.680]
Popstar Michael Jackson has been accused of multiple counts of child molestation involving a 12-year-old boy

[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.780]
And a ward has reportedly been issued for his arrest, says ABC News

[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.640]
The official documents in the case have been sealed

[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.660]
Because it involves a minor insensitive charges

[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.280]
But court TV says, citing anonymous sources, that a Santa Barbara County, California judge cited a rest warrant for Jackson

[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.840]
Between 60 and 70 investigators from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department of the DA's office

[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.180]
Carried out a search warrant yesterday morning at the 45-year-olds

[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.920]
45, can you believe that?

[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.400]
Yeah

[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.480]
Well, here's the queen, seriously, if she don't look like the mad hat or where that hat or the purple hat

[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.720]
No, I'm serious, nobody wears that hat like that

[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.860]
It's a real nice hat, come on

[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.100]
Oh, come on, all the mad hat or in Malice and Wonderland wore a piece like that

[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.020]
There's the queen with George

[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.740]
She says, oh, if you think of the only queen in this house, you've mistaken. Anyway

[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:47.100]
Between 60 and 70 investigators and the DA's office, carried out a search warrant yesterday morning at the 45-year-old singer's home in the Santa Inez Valley official

[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.780]
Said they spent several hours at the ranch

[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.140]
Court TV's Diane Diamond said law enforcement sources told her and the rest warrant had been issued

[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.140]
Which would allow Jackson to be put in handcuffs in all 50 states

[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.980]
Oh, right, yeah, don't we want to see that?

[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.540]
Yeah, I do

[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.480]
The search was part of an ongoing criminal better late than never, land

[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.520]
The search was part of an ongoing criminal investigation sergeant Chris Papis said in the statement

[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.400]
But authorities declined to elaborate they plan to hold a news conference today

[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.520]
Papis denied an arrest warrant had been issued but if court TV says it, you know damn well, right?

[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.700]
They don't mess with the truth, right?

[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.180]
Brian Oxman, who was represented the Jackson family members, the pastor of the investigation involved a molestation allegation

[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:33.440]
He said the investigation is about a 12-year-old boy devolves a molestation allegation and maybe masturbation at the station

[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.400]
Oxman said in the statement sheriff deputies have been investigating the case for musters in an ambulance that's already come and gone

[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.760]
Well, what's that all about an ambulance?

[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.780]
I don't know. Maybe bubbles are ruptured something. Did he die?

[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.700]
No, actually bubbles got too old for him. See if anything gets...

[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.220]
I'm not joking about that. I was in that book the unauthorized biography of a pitiful

[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.220]
There's a forensics van on the scene. Here we go again. He said this is insane, said Mr. Oxman

[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.620]
Jackson spokesman steward backerman told ABC News that Oxman was not authorized to make official statements on the singer's behalf

[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.620]
And a statement released the last night Jackson officials represented said he didn't know what the investigation was about

[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.440]
But that the entertainer would cooperate with authorities backerman can then the malignant hoard of media hounds

[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.740]
Those brownie hounds who claim to have the inside pooped scoop

[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.680]
A rogue's gallery of hucksters and self-styled inside sources have dominated the away-sense reports of a search in Everland broke

[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.380]
Speculating and by the way, I don't think there is any search all those pictures we just seen I think it's like we're the head of the man on the moon

[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.580]
Don't you? Sure, why not?

[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.940]
It's a hoax. Hoax. This is the big hoax

[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:47.740]
So anyway, Michael Jackson may wind up in handcuffs to which we say, yeah, long long overdue

[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.680]
Anybody buying that he's the daddy of those baby? No. No. The him and Lisa Marie ever. No, no chance. Not a Chinaman

[00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.920]
Chance and I noticed Johnny cock me now. It didn't take this story wasn't even Luke warm yet

[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.720]
Before already there were starting like a king last night on channel surf and there's our good buddy Larry

[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.540]
And he's got his panel there's what's your name Nancy Grace and all these other regrave robbers are there?

[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.400]
Well, you know Michael listen Michael and they're starting all over again. So like I said, thank you Betty Betty Muff

[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.680]
Thank you to Ilyon and Maris Grissiass and all of those people

[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.380]
Because otherwise what though would we have to talk about right? Hey man?

[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.700]
Because the public doesn't care about all the important stuff and we know that like a rack like that

[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.460]
Like the fact is all these innocent people dying every day of all shapes and sizes and varieties for no reason at all

[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.040]
Based on a bunch of bull crap lies. Yeah, they're Arabs

[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.380]
Now I'm talking about the herbs and the Americans and the Brits and whoever else and innocent people

[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.680]
Anyway 1229 votes now. I want to say this Eric

[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.800]
You're doing a great job on our website, but I have a feeling I could be wrong

[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.660]
I have a feeling either Eric there's only one or three possibilities

[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.460]
Okay, all right because it started on Saturday

[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:01.900]
I noticed either Eric has done something different on my stats page there so that the measuring that hits on our website

[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.960]
Everything is like a different thing which he hasn't have it at doing that when at least expected

[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:11.580]
Either that happened or after for well God can the audience is gone. That's the number two possibility

[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.760]
Or number three everybody's bailed out of town because of the FDA a

[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.440]
Everybody's just left because you keep telling me that when you're driving in there's no traffic normal this week

[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.640]
No, there hasn't been a lot of it and it's too early for people to be going away for Thanksgiving

[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.680]
Now I do notice in the October trend that we talked about yesterday that the sports nerds man today rule or what?

[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.580]
Absolutely wow six three in the morning

[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:41.280]
In men we had a six five afternoons a seven nine so our run has I mean we were number one in our time slot

[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:46.560]
But our run is rule of the worst on the station is over and I'm glad I'm glad to see that I hope it continues

[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.980]
You know what I mean? Okay, no, it's too I mean as long as we're number one we get the bonuses what are we care?

[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.520]
It's too much for us to let the man dog in a hopper are curious for while let them mode do it then we've been said let for well

[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.720]
Nobody can't do it. He's not here no more. I'd be nice to get that station overall bonus time

[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.640]
Well, we're still number one and men right still a five six number one and men baby Q a m

[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:14.040]
So that's the rest of the world we know I think it's time to do take a moment catch your breath. Yeah, that's it. Don't you think?

[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:21.360]
What's that from? Huh? Is that one of those jingles? The next group is more great stuff from Pam's that yeah, that's that jingles thing

[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:31.920]
But I like the way he says take a moment catch your breath. Yeah, that's what Greg ought to do before he hires anybody else. God. Just take a deep breath and sit back before he gets so carried away with your sports craft.

[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:38.080]
We asked yesterday what was the number one bad idea of last century now we're getting a ton of votes on our polls because the first one we did yesterday

[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:47.500]
What was the first one about Joe Rosen and it wasn't even worded properly. We left out we're I'm listening to both I like to for all that I'm listening to Joe

[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:53.140]
And let me say to get more Joe hates you quit sucking around Joe is complaining bitterly in a hallway

[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.780]
And George can verify this he was a spy that Moe keeps coming in there sucking around it doesn't get the message

[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.900]
He don't want nothing to do with the mole my street doesn't want to smell him. He doesn't want to see me doesn't want to pet his muskrat

[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:10.980]
He don't want to any part of that old part he invaded the show. Yeah, he invaded the show. He don't want you in there. He's only got two hours for Christ

[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:16.320]
He will coot stay the hell out of there quit inviting yourself in man a man who came to dinner and wouldn't leave

[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:26.240]
We asked what was the number one bad idea the last century 1229 votes United Nations creation of Israel in the middle of a billion people who hate them

[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.200]
213 that was the worst idea

[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.660]
But I think that road map is

[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:37.560]
Then we had a really good battle for second place the supreme court stopping the Florida whole count the 2000 election

[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:43.120]
192 people said that was a bad idea and the mole my steer gave him a nice run for their money

[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.480]
Absolutely

[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:49.440]

[00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.730]
better hello hey now sir you let off one main thing on your poll yesterday what was our

[00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:59.350]
creation of the irs yeah that's a good a good bad idea yep all next time yep next

[00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:04.970]
already thanks pal and hey up yeah let's see now see it and took a thing on our website a

[00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.830]
poll last night which ordinarily pay no attention those because they're a dime a dozen but they

[00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:13.930]
had over two hundred and seventeen thousand votes just a little more than we usually get and the

[00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:22.210]
question was crap do you well my other question now whether you agree with the should not and

[00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:26.830]
here's the question I remember it now should the Massachusetts legislature pass legislation to

[00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:34.490]
make game-merge legal 217 thousand plus votes 44 percent said yes 56 percent said no so these

[00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.770]
stats that they're giving you nationwide about well only 30 a 5 percent and like 60 I think

[00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:44.730]
they're saying 34 to 65 percent like two thirds of the country are against it now granted 44 to 56

[00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.270]
isn't that close but it certainly a lot closer than they would lead you to believe they lead you

[00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:51.850]
believe that most everybody lives like an abelene Texas or something and some kind of a

[00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.570]
the end of the thought big it you know or everybody lives in Dave County in the country

[00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:01.550]
and as a result is pointing fingers at bullgarons and madacos and all this other crap you know

[00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.970]
obsessed with that factory they're not because most people are too worried about their own goddamn

[00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.550]
lives right if you ask me I could be wrong here's our first poll today what's your take on game

[00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:19.610]
marriage is a no way god didn't create Adam and Steve why should I care absolutely absolutely

[00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:25.150]
everyone should have equal rights civil unions are okay but not marriage and only for members of

[00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:30.990]
the priesthood while I had to put a little bit of a very little boy we don't want to get too heavy

[00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.970]
duty do we they don't want to marry each other and we certainly don't want to put nothing about

[00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:39.830]
neverland and they're because that would be bad taste it gets my grip michael says it's really bad

[00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:45.090]
taste especially if they're over the age of 12 that michael's action thing man that should have

[00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.950]
people just foaming it them out long overdue so you can get away for a while michael you can

[00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:54.330]
fake your way through but the bottom line is we're on the other one I heard nobody wants any more

[00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:58.750]
of your stupid records nobody wants to go buy your crap that your peddler nobody wants to see that

[00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:04.830]
grotesque push and so I started to say before that the johnny cock ring was sticking his nose into

[00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:09.590]
this again every time michael jackson services johnny cock ring force a habit I guess has to open

[00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:14.990]
up a push the only difference being that I guess he forgot to take a look recently see because johnny's

[00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:20.430]
always coming to the defense of black guys usually who are guilty is like oh jay yeah but oh jay's

[00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:25.970]
a little bit blacker than michael if you catch my drift like a black on the inside is that what it is

[00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:31.990]
he's dark on the inside I guarantee that I won't say it's like what evil he's evil is what he is

[00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:37.350]
well let's see we got a few votes on there already this is pretty promising 21 votes popped up

[00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:42.290]
immediately what's your take on game images absolutely everyone should have equal rights nine

[00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:47.710]
only for members of the priesthood four why should I care three civil unions okay but not

[00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:52.990]
marriage three and no way god didn't create adamant thief two I love the people to say that that's

[00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:58.130]
why I put it on god didn't create adamant thief it's always the ones who are the most

[00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:02.290]
limperisted who are talking like that more like adamant eddie would be good you know adamant eddie

[00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:09.630]
little problem over here in england or don't have palace wants to investigation today and how it

[00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.670]
hired a journalist with a fake reference to be one of the servants assigned to serve president

[00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:19.670]
bushes party boy don't sound of it isn't no it doesn't get the daily mirror newspaper claiming

[00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.870]
you have exposed a security breach it buck and i am pala said its reporter be given full access

[00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:29.810]

[00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:34.730]

[00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:38.370]
three in the afternoon over there it said perry quit his job as a royal footman at midnight

[00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:43.570]
twos day we're keeping told this is the biggest security operation of all time it seems to me

[00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:47.910]
to beg her belief oh don't you love the way they talk bugger it seems to me to bugger belief

[00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:52.370]
that we could get to a situation as we did last night where our journalist was detailed with serving

[00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:57.670]
breakfast on the presidential floor this morning and at the state banquet tonight i'll see

[00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:01.430]
that i think they got the bushes confused one and two because this this bush hadn't been on the

[00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:08.070]
floor yet the first one he had a little little problem i hate like that brine brine greasy

[00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:12.730]
syndrome when he was in japan the other problem fallen down i'm desperately looking for this damn thing

[00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:18.630]

[00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:29.770]
where i'm looking for good a gap f up i see we have airy confidence in the british security white

[00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:34.030]
house spokesman clear bucans they see referred all of the questions to british officials in other

[00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:38.770]
words we don't want to touch it i guess you all heard that we don't want to touch it

[00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.150]
bucking and palace was conducting a full investigation of the incident a raw spokesman sent

[00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.730]

white house in the pentagon how is that possible if you thought about that have you wondered

[00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:12.390]
yeah briefly how the hell it's possible that they weren't scrambling just like a media of it i mean

[00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:17.130]
they knew that one plane had been hijacked and then of course within just a matter of minutes they

[00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:21.570]
knew that at least another plane had been hijacked how come there was like all kinds activity going on

[00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.210]
they were coming up with a present he was sitting there with that stupid look on his

fart right now after neighborhood would go up

[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.480]
you know what that reminds me of what he says he doesn't want to be seen with him it's kind

[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.860]
like Joe Rosan about Moe he don't want it if people see him that Moe is in the studio with him

[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:04.440]
because he doesn't want him there speaking of Moe yes he's real pissed off about those best

[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:11.300]
anneal uh things that were running why is that because in some of them uh they're

[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:19.060]
they're you know you're playing excerpts right of bits that are right about him and and he don't like it

[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:24.340]
well you know what he can blow it out his old ass i think he is well what do you mean he don't like

[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:30.180]
he doesn't like it first of all let me ask you this question did we put those promos together

[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:35.520]
no evil evil Tommy did evil Tommy and production did it which Tommy is a great guy and Tommy did

[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.940]
because he knows that those are some of the audiences favorite bits see if you're really behind

[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:44.120]
our charity drives since since you didn't donate a dime moe and supposedly your your help on

[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:50.560]
the salvage by letting us use your likeness your voice your uh centurion tones on our uh the key

[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.860]
chains uh then just dummy up okay don't be bitching and belly it can about you don't like this you

[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:59.040]
don't like anything that's why everybody hates you Moe that's why you're damn near beat out the

[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.960]
hanging sheds you came in a strong third in that port yesterday on the worst idea of the past

[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:08.740]
century i have never and the fact that they had that six three in the morning that has to either

[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:13.440]
be an aberration or the a handful of moe liquors they got the pulled or it was all for real you know

[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:18.960]
it was all for real it was all me me me me me me me me me me could have been who now how long is

[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:24.320]
but regardless whether he's got a six share or a point six share which he's had those and they

[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.920]
make any difference he's still the same piece of crap okay we don't care whether you like the

[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.640]
promos or don't like him and by the way if we've had a for real key chain would have raised a

[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:35.400]
hell of a lot more money for abandoned pet rescue than we're doing with your steps in fact i think

[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.300]
even a mad dog one all right the old ones from a couple of years ago are going better all right

[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:44.740]
Miguel they are he uh had to go to a meeting yeah absolutely a Tommy here right now we got Tommy in

[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:50.360]
there yeah I'm not that I'm complaining Tommy's fine but uh you I mean I'm gonna put all the stuff

[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.940]
on the five families and Miguel had to run off and well what kind of a song otherwise once again

[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.680]
I mean Tommy's got another job there in the building so once again what they do with his oh is there

[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.640]
anybody is there a body here we got going there and push the buttons and play the goddamn spots

[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.860]
what kind of crap is that I say we kidnapped Miguel and redefine no I say we kidnapped a Greg

[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.840]
Reed is what I say okay we get nothing but leftovers on this station we're making a more money

[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.560]
than God that bitch scruan who sitting back there with somebody's a toes in her you know where

[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:25.380]
yeah she likes the toe job toe jam toe jam yeah jam it jam it honey skanky bitch

[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.440]
but I mean seriously what kind of business is this it's bad enough that they brought in for

[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.920]
else boyfriend there who was like uh I mean wow uh if the audience could only know

[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:40.340]
that was the strangest piece of work I've ever encountered he made beater boys seem like a rocket

[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.220]
scientist he made me he made beater boys seem almost human you're close personal friend

[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:53.100]
man oh man the strangest looks and expressions and just oh like uh just it totally incompetent on top

[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:57.340]
of that but nevertheless so we had Miguel for a little while now we got Tommy and probably next

[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.100]
hour will be like maybe Robert Gryper will come in at which point I'll get up and walk out I'll go

[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:05.020]
out my living room let me know if he percomes in okay all right all right I want to I won't do

[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.520]
the show with that prick on the I just don't want to part of him he should have been fired a long

[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:13.420]
time ago in fact this this coming year you know how we make new years resolutions it's only the

[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:17.580]
middle of November but I'm starting right now for 2004 that's gonna be my I don't try to get

[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:21.580]
anybody can't I don't like like Moe is always doing I'm not interested in depriving anybody

[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.920]
else of a livelihood even Moe but in Robert Gryper's case that's where I draw the line I'll make

[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:32.180]
an exception oh what you never saw he said can he said dickhead he's a troublemaker in a backstabber

[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:36.660]
and he does more damn things wrong and shows up on whenever how he feels like it because he's a

[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.160]
professional student has been going to school for a hundred years and now the rumor is he's got a

[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:45.680]
girlfriend that's the rumor the girlfriend's name is Ted I believe I heard a confirmation on that

[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:53.760]
on what Ted oh give me a break what is that what does that look like what could that possibly be huh

[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:59.320]
I heard actually not not bad looking get out of here get out of town maybe you better

[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:03.600]
worry about your date yeah that's right maybe you better on jade maybe your name is Clarence

[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:10.100]
he's not real bad looking well pan-frican voka faxes and says how about a countdown clock on your

[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:14.800]
website with zero day being the day that moe Howard David Dodd-Ozzi contract is up what do you think

[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.360]
absolutely yeah I don't even know when that is plus he's I think his contract he must be extending

[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:24.160]
it farther out than I am because I got three years and a month and a half not that I'm counting

[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.020]
but the one he extorted them and we're standing yeah we all know about that Moe we love the way

[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:33.540]
you try to pull this crap and then keep it behind the scenes behind closed doors he can't stand it

[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.920]
in fact I wonder he and Jack Thompson get along so well because they like to pull all their crap

[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.080]
behind the scenes and then oh well don't play me for that don't talk about that I have nothing to do

[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:46.400]
with that you know but I'd like to give both of them all the credit for all of the dirty deeds that

[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:53.860]
they do so Moe you're right in there in the same category same smell so he and his agent extorted

[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:59.280]
Greg and we're sending his contract to what they're 25 25 something like that so we don't know

[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:04.800]
also what says last week you said nobody don't dislike our carny I did say that at least that's

[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.680]
what I think you said yes Patrick that is what I said how about a pull see the problem with Patrick

[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.580]
is he hasn't been listening either long enough for you mr show which is unacceptable how about a

[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:26.380]
guys he says love you show them websites so we love you to Patrick but you really really

[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.620]

[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.160]
Another great Michael Jackson classics.

[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.840]
Mike Billy's jeans, D&O out of self-rime, and of course smooth criminal.

[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.400]
Yes, it's Michael Jackson's tour to benefit the Cardinal Clancy School for Wayward Boys.

[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:44.160]
Get your tickets now, boys under 10 of it and free when a cup of wine no one.

[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:47.140]
They're back, they're white, they're really really tight.

[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:51.160]
They're back, they're white, they're really really tight.

[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.060]
Oh, that's a 10 before 11th.

[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.480]
Thank God for Michael, you know, what that would be, I mean, like I said, they're people dying

[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.540]
all over the world, people bowing each other up.

[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.020]
We're sitting on pins and needles waiting for the next shoe to drop.

[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.160]
And Michael's a pedophile.

[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.520]
Wow, canoville, huh?

[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:05.980]
What a surprise.

[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:06.920]
What a shock.

[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:08.820]
161 votes.

[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.980]
So anyway, Eric says he hasn't ditto with our thing.

[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.760]
He's ditto with his own thing right now.

[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.960]
But so that's a bad omen.

[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:20.500]
I mean, everybody's left town since Friday, I guess, or our audience is bad moves.

[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.700]
Once for our left, that was the end of QAM as we used it.

[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.180]
Once knew it for a brief few months.

[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.100]
Glorious months.

[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.060]
Think that's possible?

[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.020]
It's possible.

[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:31.420]
And I think now that Tommy is there, I think it's very apropropriate for Tommy to apologize

[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.920]
to Moe for making those promos.

[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:35.000]
You know what I mean?

[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:35.500]
Absolutely.

[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.580]
That had excerpts from us ripping him an ass and making fun of him.

[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.320]
Promos?

[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.480]
Do you want to apologize?

[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:43.840]
Tommy?

[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:44.680]
I want to apologize.

[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.120]
He don't want to apologize because he hates him like point two.

[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.180]
I don't want to put words in your mouth, but he hates him.

[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.160]
Like everybody else does.

[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.340]
Why should Tommy be any different?

[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.520]
Especially now that he looks like human with his hair back.

[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.460]
Like, you know, like a guy.

[00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.800]
161 votes on a poll.

[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.440]
What's your take on game marriages?

[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:03.220]
Absolutely, they said.

[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:03.700]
Absolutely.

[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:04.980]
Everyone should have equal right.

[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:05.280]
64.

[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.980]
Seems like a no-drainer to me.

[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:07.420]
Right?

[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:07.700]

[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.380]
Like I said, 67 out of 168 now.

[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.620]
Why should I care 43?

[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.660]
In other words, my own business sounds good.

[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.180]
Civil unions are okay, but not marriage.

[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.140]
25.

[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:18.620]
26.

[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:19.580]
Whatever that number says.

[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.700]
No way God didn't create Adam and Steve 16.

[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.020]
And only for members of the priesthood 16.

[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:25.740]
I don't know.

[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:26.820]
We had 16 priest listening.

[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.180]
Did you?

[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:28.640]
Love.

[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.120]
I think we have more than that.

[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.660]
I think that's a beautiful thing.

[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.560]
Oh, they're all listening right now.

[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:33.420]
They're hanging on every word.

[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:34.840]
How's it going, father?

[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.760]
Pulse who does public evenly split on what the gays can change sexual orientation.

[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.440]
This from the A and P.

[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.380]
Every shot at the N P.

[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.560]
Tommy doesn't know what he had up with.

[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.900]
The call on line nine.

[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:48.620]
That's his Miami.

[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.240]
No matter who we have in there, whether it's Tommy who just was dragged in there,

[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.680]
kicking and screaming or McGill or a Scott or anybody else.

[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.460]
It doesn't make any difference because they still put line nine is in Miami.

[00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:58.780]
See?

[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.660]
You see that on the screen?

[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.220]
Let's go to line nine in Miami.

[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:03.580]
Hello?

[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:06.620]
There he is.

[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.280]
It's always him.

[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.100]
It's always making a difference what it is.

[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.680]
Nobody in day to brow is going to call on line nine.

[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:12.920]
It's like a toll free number.

[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.140]
They already got a free number.

[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.260]
So it's kind of like holding up a billboard saying,

[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.320]
hey, it's me again.

[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.860]
The misfit, the professional crack, the worst of all of them.

[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.260]
The one with like four different voices with the a all the crap.

[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:22.960]
It's me.

[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.880]
But it's a good thing we get him on here because we keep him off the street.

[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.260]
For a few minutes anyway.

[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.280]
Oh no, for four hours.

[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.640]
Here's Miami on six, which is always an adventure.

[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:34.980]
Hello?

[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:41.260]
Hey, you might really consider those my numbers for the six to ten hour.

[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.520]
That was back when the four of Marlins made their run.

[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:45.140]
Right.

[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:46.620]
We've discussed that.

[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.780]
October was a humongous sports month because it was the playoffs in the World Series.

[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.500]
And so the sports shows did huge.

[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:52.740]
And we did like less well.

[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.980]
I mean, we were still number one, but we were like small potatoes.

[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.220]
The sports shows had huge months in October.

[00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:02.000]
Yeah, but that's because people don't want to stay up for two o'clock in the morning watching a Florida Marlins game.

[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.940]
So, you know, the sports halls, that's what they do is they tune in first and then on the way to work.

[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:06.420]
Right.

[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.920]
Yeah, that's when all the of front running phonies, the bandwagon, Jeppers, were hopping aboard and getting all whipped up.

[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.500]
Hey, let me ask you a question.

[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.640]
I'm your poet the other day, the about obscure movies.

[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.320]
Let me ask you, what about Glengague, Glen Ross?

[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:21.040]
Would you consider that obscure?

[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.120]
I mean, I don't remember here anything about that one.

[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.460]
I mean, it's fairly obscure.

[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.300]
I mean, it's, it was a pretty well known movie.

[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.080]
Plus, when you look at the people who were in it, I mean, Huck and Epi of Scare.

[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:30.880]
True.

[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:31.680]
Is it great?

[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:32.560]
It's great.

[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:33.640]
Fabulous.

[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.080]
I'm going to watch you again this weekend.

[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.040]
You just inspired me.

[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.180]
It's just the fabulous effect.

[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:38.740]
Yes, you're right.

[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.200]
When you have a sale department like we do a QA, and you got to watch it every day.

[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.960]
Any how far along are you in, dude, where's my country?

[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.320]
How far along?

[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:48.200]
I've finished it.

[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:49.040]
How you finished it?

[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.980]
I'm doing the, I'm doing the Al Franken book now.

[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.140]
Nice.

[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:52.540]
Nice.

[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.320]
We're having a good one.

[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:54.100]
Thank you, too.

[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:55.960]
Yeah, dude, where's my country?

[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.080]
Everybody's got to read that.

[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.920]
Everybody's going to watch bowling for Columbine.

[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.000]
Everybody must read, dude, where's my country?

[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.640]
And everybody read you ought to be reading or listen to me read it on the ear.

[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.160]
See, I don't think they like that.

[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:07.320]
Who do they hate?

[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:07.700]
What?

[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.120]
The audience, I think they hate it.

[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:15.360]
No, seriously, we had such a poultry turnout of a hits on a website yesterday, 152,000.

[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.040]
It's like at least 60, 70,000 sure to what we usually do.

[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:23.060]
So like I said, you either, no, seriously, because I take these things, it's very important, isn't it?

[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:23.300]
No.

[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.500]
Well, I mean, you know, I got to do something.

[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.300]
Something to pretend that is still here.

[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.660]
You know, it can't go on forever, right?

[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:32.580]
Why?

[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:33.560]
We can't be the king of the hill.

[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:34.360]
No, no way.

[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.200]
It can't be a forever.

[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.820]
Let the mad dog do it.

[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:37.600]
Let the Humper do it.

[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.120]
It's his...

[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.040]
I can't show it.

[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:39.920]
I'm talking about him.

[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:40.800]
He liked the hop on it.

[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:42.240]
Yeah, it was hilarious.

[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:47.840]
But it's just, I think, and of course, when it's for real God, can, now all of a sudden we've got a major turnaround there, you know?

[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:48.980]
You know what I mean?

[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.480]
Ah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.940]
And we got Joe, which we love Joe.

[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.020]
And he did pretty good.

[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:55.640]
I don't know how to interpret that poll yesterday, which was my intent.

[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.000]
Keep it real confusing, because it might have turned out bad.

[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.680]
Poll suggests public evenly split up other gains can change sexual orientation.

[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.800]
See, I mean, where did that come from?

[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.500]
What does that have to do with the price of peanuts?

[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.520]
I mean, that's so stupid.

[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.060]
Mm-hmm.

[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:10.560]
God, are you...

[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.880]
Some of you people really need some serious help.

[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.420]
And this is what's wrong with America.

[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:18.600]
One of the main things that there's so many ignorant, ignorant people who just are...

[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.600]
I don't know what kind of a planet you're living on, man.

[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.100]
What kind of a cave you're hiding in?

[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.480]
Why would you choose that?

[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.020]
Why would you choose that?

[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:24.860]
Of course, it's like...

[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.300]
It's like, it's just to be black and people...

[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.220]
Right. That's a bad comparison, because you're born black.

[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.680]
Well, you're born whatever the hell you are, too.

[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:30.560]
They know that.

[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:31.760]
There's no question about it.

[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.120]
It's in your genes, baby.

[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.220]
It's in them genes.

[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.680]
Just open up that fly.

[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:37.880]
And there are pops right out.

[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:38.700]
It's in your genes.

[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.560]
Usually when I say that, they run.

[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.860]
The public is evenly divided on whether gays and lesbians can change their sexual orientation.

[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:49.920]
And white evangelicals are the most likely to think homosexuals can change their ways.

[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.620]
Again, what is the prize? What is shock?

[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:52.760]
Too bad they can't change theirs.

[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.720]
Yeah. Too bad they can't become like part of the human race.

[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.660]
Oh, but the Bible says, and Jesus says, is an abomination of the eyes of the Lord.

[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.860]
Yeah, blow it out your ass.

[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:01.380]
You silly.

[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.160]
I'm telling you, the religious people are the dangerous people.

[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:05.860]
Look all over the world, not in history.

[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.380]
Just today, right now, this minute.

[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.100]
We got that born again, Bufo over there in the London.

[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:14.260]
They're all laughing, they're asking, they're running around protesting, screaming and carrying on.

[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:18.260]
And in America, what we heard about Michael Jackson, all right, we're talking to this.

[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:21.020]
The BBC has made a big, semi-subout, that story, too.

[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:22.960]
The Michael Jackson story?

[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:23.860]
Good.

[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.380]
You know what I'd like to make a big, semi-subout, is Todd Dreck.

[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:30.120]
I think next time I come back to town, he needs to be hung like Mussolini.

[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:34.180]
And believe me, from what I'm hearing from the sales department and screw in, he definitely ain't hung.

[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:35.280]
But he should be.

[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:36.700]
What a piece of crap, man.

[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.880]
Seriously, this guy is making money from all that phony agency stuff.

[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.440]
He's got an all commission from these accounts.

[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:45.600]
And he must have naked pictures of these people because he doesn't do anything for him, you know?

[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.120]
Right.

[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.120]
Man, we hate you, Todd.

[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.680]
In fact, you're a close second to the mole man.

[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:51.700]
Even Tommy would agree.

[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:52.280]
Absolutely.

[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.620]
Todd Dreck is the anti-Christ junior.

[00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.580]

Here's the answer for you.

[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:03.960]

This is for 20 or vice-cater.

[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:05.340]
You weigh out.

[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:08.320]
Wait in gentlemen.

[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:12.820]
Michael Jackson reveals the secret behind the pitch of his voice.

[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:13.940]
And downcrotch.

[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:15.060]
And downcrotch.

[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:16.220]
And downcrotch.

[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.300]
And downcrotch.

[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.460]
And downcrotch.

[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:19.040]
And downcrotch.

[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:19.620]
And downcrotch.

[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.760]
And downcrotch.

[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.320]
And downcrotch.

[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:21.520]
And downcrotch.

[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.520]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.260]
All right.

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:34.180]
A met up priest when I was a lever.

[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:40.200]
He said he would save my soul.

[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:46.520]
But we made a detour on the way to heaven.

[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:52.300]
That into his bedroom we did take a stroll.

[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.440]
Well, he was standing in his underwear.

[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.560]
Told me to bend over and say a prayer.

[00:48:59.000 --> 00:48:59.440]
I told him.

[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:02.220]
Pulled up his rope and went, then thank you, ma'am.

[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:07.080]
I got my lesson by the preacher man behind the rectory.

[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:17.220]
The next day I felt like a sinner.

[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:22.380]
And I showed up to get communion.

[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:29.460]
But on my tongue that was in wafer.

[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.980]
And it wasn't while a tripping up my chin.

[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:36.720]
What should I do?

[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:36.720]

[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.460]
He was standing in his underwear.

[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:41.780]
Told me to bend over and say a prayer.

[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.220]
Pulled up his rope and went, then thank you, ma'am.

[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:49.980]
I got my lesson by the preacher man behind the rectory.

[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:54.040]
He was standing in his underwear.

[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.240]
I told me to bend over and say it prayer.

[00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.280]
Pulled up as Roman, man, man, thank you, man.

[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.940]
I got molested by the preacher man being a directory.

[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:09.360]
You know, that Michael Jackson tour bit, which is a several years old, it's one of our

[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.760]
oldest best of me old disc.

[00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:11.260]
Right.

[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.840]
That has to be the best of all time.

[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.940]
You know, I listen to that and the, it's just brilliant.

[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:16.520]
You know what I mean?

[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:16.760]
Right.

[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:21.680]
I mean, vocal Brian stuff a lot of it is brilliant, but that, that thing is just phenomenal.

[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.380]
Is it just me?

[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.200]
No, it's great.

[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.380]
Doesn't it just blow you away?

[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:28.880]
I was speaking of blowing.

[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:34.340]
The ceremony was held unusually in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace inside the

[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.280]
fortified security.

[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:38.020]
It was the Charliewood lady where it is.

[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.920]
Beyond it, there were some demonstrations, but they were small and scattered.

[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.520]
Some just a lone voice of protest.

[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:48.360]
If you think there was a, oh, you'll know.

[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.000]
Opposition is expected to build.

[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:57.280]
But so far, day one of the visits can be, yeah, the big stuff is going to be on Thursday.

[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.180]
That's going to be going to all hell's going to break loose.

[00:50:59.400 --> 00:50:59.720]
A rat.

[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:02.260]
Here's the fact is, what chapter are you reading today?

[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:02.860]
Love it.

[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:03.980]
Well, and they're serious, too.

[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:07.220]
They like the, because I read this week, two chapters from the Al Franken book,

[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.640]
lying liars and liars who tell them.

[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.480]
And the one chapter was about Ann Cotter, that's Skanky bitch.

[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:17.240]
And the one yesterday was about Bill O'Reilly, that line piece of turd whose whole life is in the spin and dry zone.

[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.840]
They were both great and funny.

[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:19.440]
Yeah.

[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.100]
But I'm telling you, the audience hates that. They don't like it.

[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:24.920]
What do they know?

[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.320]
I'm just saying it like those seven months.

[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:30.620]
Just ask Tommy. He'll tell you. He hated those seven months while I didn't take any phone calls.

[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:32.280]
He's one of those people likes the calls.

[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.680]
If he's happy to be listening in between doing all of the great spots.

[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:36.820]
That interest. Huh? That's not true.

[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.840]
Hates that. Miguel hated it.

[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.080]
Duff hated it. Clarence despised it.

[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.400]
Guaranteed didn't tell me that to my face because naturally,

[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.480]
none of them have the balls to say the name of my face being a hot shot that I am.

[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.820]
You know why Clarence hated it?

[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:52.660]
Because I didn't read no stories about points.

[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.300]
That's the deal right there.

[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.080]
If it's not about points, those guys don't want to know from it.

[00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:00.240]
And muff, I mean, she don't really give a crap on what they're about points.

[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.400]
But because the station is supposed to be a station.

[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.620]
Therefore, he's got a pretend that she cares, which is why she shows up at the dolphin games and the Marling games.

[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:08.560]
Yeah, she's got to be real.

[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:09.580]
Talks nipper.

[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:10.440]
Was she likes that part?

[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.520]
So that's the deal.

[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.720]
We'll find out today.

[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:14.480]
In fact, let's do it.

[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:15.320]
Don't answer the phone time.

[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.740]
We'll do a screen was real quickie.

[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:17.140]
Okay.

[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.080]
You got it.

[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:18.700]
And we'll find.

[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:21.960]
Oh, they always like the toughest assignments.

[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:22.320]
Yeah.

[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:24.380]
I don't even know why we answer the phones on the show.

[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.160]
It's what my wife and father anymore.

[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.140]
Damn good question.

[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.200]
Why do you answer the phone?

[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:30.800]
It's like me being here.

[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:31.860]
Why do I even answer the phone?

[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.940]
It's almost always something I don't want to talk to.

[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:35.260]
God.

[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:37.780]
Hey, Izzy, you're a good guy.

[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:39.160]
I hope you're a thing heals up.

[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.200]
But don't call me up here anymore.

[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:40.560]
Okay.

[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:41.300]
Just leave me alone.

[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.960]
And the same for PD Lenny.

[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.600]
Don't be calling here.

[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:47.120]
I mean, people that have no business even have the phone number are calling here.

[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.040]
God.

[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:49.880]
Try to get away from that place.

[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.120]
And they still won't leave you the hell alone.

[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:52.900]
Okay.

[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:55.120]
So that's a quick, we'll take like a quick survey.

[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.640]
Before we go on.

[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:57.000]
Yes.

[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.600]
And I'm not exaggerating.

[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:03.960]
This is the fifth time that we've gotten the five page George Bush resume from the same asshole.

[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.780]
Oh, stop sending us the George Bush resume.

[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:07.680]
It's older and still we already had it in the first place.

[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.780]
Anyway, we already know about it.

[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:10.120]
It's not that we don't want to stop.

[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.400]
Every day from someone who don't want it.

[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:13.220]
You idiot you.

[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.680]
You schmuck you in your, you schmuck.

[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:17.560]
Well, as soon as it starts coming, just press the stop and cancel.

[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.040]
Oh, you know, I've been.

[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:20.520]
God.

[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.540]
What kind of crap is that anyway?

[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:23.340]
You're dimmer with us.

[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.080]
Okay, we don't want it.

[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:24.940]
It's not funny.

[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:25.980]
Oh, look at this.

[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:28.380]
Here's a guy with a beard made up and dreaded.

[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:30.420]
You can see it Prince William's 21st birthday.

[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:34.420]
Now the home secretary has announced this to be a review of palace security.

[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:37.480]
Oh, that was the guy who had to crash the Prince Wills of the birthday.

[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:37.920]
Remember that?

[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.800]
The guy with the lovely pink outfit.

[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:44.600]
So we'll do like a quick screen listing on the reading those chapters, the Alfred.

[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:45.600]
WQIM.

[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.580]
I guess it's okay for you to chase 14 year old kids around.

[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:51.880]
Now I'm chasing 14 year old kids around, Reverend Jones.

[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:53.900]
WQIM.

[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:56.440]
Okay, good.

[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:57.820]
This was a good idea, wanted it?

[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:57.980]
A-huh?

[00:53:58.120 --> 00:53:58.740]
WQIM. Hello.

[00:53:59.400 --> 00:53:59.620]
Luca.

[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:01.520]
Luca.

[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:02.140]
Luca.

[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:02.380]
Luzza.

[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:03.520]
Luzza.

[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.540]
Here's a candle when I was already unhold.

[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:06.720]
Hello.

[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.560]
How you doing, sir?

[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:12.060]
Hey, um, okay, about these same sex marriages, you know?

[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:12.660]
Yeah.

[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.440]
You know, I don't know like, I mean, okay.

[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.200]
Now we know what the American public knows and everything, right?

[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.620]
But the gay, I know what?

[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:20.320]
You're gonna know what?

[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:25.980]
Well, we know that let's say a little more than half is opposed to the, you know, to the other side, which is the, yeah.

[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:27.760]
I can say the 55-45 deal.

[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:28.460]
Yeah.

[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:29.720]
But what about the gays?

[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:33.120]
Now what is they, uh, you know, how do they feel about the gay sex marriages?

[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.700]
I don't know, I don't know, like do most gay men want to marry by the gay?

[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:36.620]
How do they feel?

[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:37.220]
Yeah.

[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.200]
With their hands?

[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:40.720]
5670560.

[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.400]
We're going to a tremendous response on it.

[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.060]
See, I told you, they don't even want to talk about it.

[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:45.680]
They, it's so we've all lived them.

[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.660]
They don't want to hear me or read those books.

[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:48.280]
What?

[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:48.900]
You think they do.

[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:49.640]
You like it?

[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:50.240]
I love it.

[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:50.720]
I love it.

[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:50.740]
I love it.

[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:51.460]
That's what it was great.

[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:52.520]
I don't like it.

[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:52.940]
I don't really like it.

[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:56.840]
They don't really want to hear all these great calls like these last year for we had so far.

[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.300]
WDQAM line one is working.

[00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:58.540]
Hello?

[00:54:58.820 --> 00:54:59.840]
Mo, like, Steinpack.

[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:01.620]
WDQAM.

[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:02.720]
Yeah.

[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.440]
Have you heard that Rick Sanchez has his own talk show in the afternoon now?

[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:05.820]
Yeah.

[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:06.320]
Who cares?

[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:07.200]
Yeah.

[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:07.500]
I don't know.

[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:08.360]
I just thought about it.

[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.280]
Do you want to know?

[00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:11.680]
Do you want to know why the things in Iraq aren't going so well?

[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.980]
One of the, uh, he had charato's over there.

[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.100]
His name is Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez.

[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:16.700]
Did you know that?

[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:19.920]
He's squatting on it.

[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.020]
Were you aware of that?

[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:22.240]
He went away.

[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:23.740]
I'm not talking to him.

[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:24.900]
He went away because I punked the button.

[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:26.000]
I'm talking to you, not him.

[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:27.360]
I think I want to talk to him.

[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:31.760]
Anybody calls me about Rick Sanchez in the middle of a very important survey that I'm doing here?

[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:32.780]
You think I want to talk to this?

[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:33.840]
Boozel?

[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.120]
So Rick Sanchez is a general?

[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:35.780]
Yes.

[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:37.560]
General pain in the ass.

[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:39.140]
WDQAM.

[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.040]
Hey, I like huffing nails, please.

[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:41.560]
Speaking.

[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:43.100]
Neil?

[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:43.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.580]
How come it doesn't sound like Neil?

[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:46.960]
That's amazing.

[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.540]
I don't know why it's me.

[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.140]
Believe me.

[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.440]
I'm looking at it and it's mine.

[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:50.940]
Trust me.

[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:51.720]
Nobody else would want it.

[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:52.040]
It's me.

[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.220]
Neil, have you finished the Al Franken book?

[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:56.700]
No.

[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:57.400]
You still read it.

[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.300]
I'm still in progress.

[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:00.560]
Have you gotten to the supply side, Jesus?

[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:00.860]
Yes.

[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:02.520]
That's awesome.

[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:03.840]
It's a cartoon near the back.

[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:04.520]
It's fantastic.

[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.620]
Also, I think the reading's great.

[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:07.680]
It's humorous.

[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:08.780]
It's enlightening.

[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:09.400]
It's awesome.

[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:10.540]
Okay.

[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.180]
I'm Mark Kiedhanna.

[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:11.960]
You and me, enjoy.

[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:12.500]
That's it.

[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:13.280]
Thank you, everybody.

[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:14.380]

[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:15.780]
See, there's three of us we like it.

[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:19.680]
But the general audience out there, that's not what they tune in to the world famous Neil Rogers show for.

[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:21.940]
They want to hear a bunch of assholes on the phone and believe me.

[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.000]
We're not going to let them down today.

[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:23.720]
Are we?

[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:24.140]
No.

[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:24.680]
No chance.

[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:25.680]
No way, Jose.

[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:28.480]
Anyway, Brittany says I'm a fine rule model.

[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.680]
Let's go to our second poll.

[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.320]
Once we get off that fag stuff.

[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:38.160]
Brittany Spears and Sishie's rule model for young girls, despite her revealing outfits and her new album would sexually explicit lyrics.

[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:41.700]
The BBC said a couple of days ago, and I got to write my hand now in the story too.

[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:45.640]
And a picture of Brittany showing her big, not anywhere in Lug J.

[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:47.200]
But she's got a ample ass.

[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:47.880]
Mm-hmm.

[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.320]
And she's got a big smile on her purse.

[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:51.980]
It's a generous amount.

[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:52.880]
And she thinks she's a rule model.

[00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:57.760]
So we'll find out if you people out there have daughters or if you had a daughter, who you think would be a good rule model for them.

[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.740]
You think it might be Brittany?

[00:56:58.820 --> 00:56:58.980]
No.

[00:56:59.240 --> 00:56:59.400]
No.

[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:00.620]
Why not?

[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.700]
She brings a lot of money, George.

[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:03.840]
She brings your home a lot of cash.

[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.140]
You okay?

[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.520]
So could a lot of people.

[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:07.520]
Dollar a holler.

[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:09.760]
Deputy QAM.

[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:10.160]
Hey.

[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.380]
Hola.

[00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:13.740]
Ah!

[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:15.700]
Deputy QAM, though.

[00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.900]
Let's talk about the bullfighting.

[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:19.440]
Ah!

[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.060]
Wow.

[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.220]
Deputy QAM.

[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:27.160]
Yes, Neal.

[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:27.540]
How are you doing?

[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:28.600]
I'm doing pretty good.

[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:32.780]
I personally found those eight months when you did all the stories.

[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:33.520]
Seven of them.

[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.300]
I'm so glad you're ready.

[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:35.280]
Do I ever heard you do?

[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:35.860]
Really?

[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:36.560]
Absolutely.

[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:38.380]
Now let me ask you this question.

[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:39.100]
How old are you?

[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:39.880]
50.

[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:41.160]
Say that's the problem.

[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.060]
You're an old fart like me.

[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:42.580]
Well, yeah.

[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:43.720]
But you know what?

[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:48.640]
As far as I'm concerned, this is a pivotal time in the history of our country.

[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:49.340]
Yeah.

[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:51.140]
Don't get too carried away.

[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:52.140]
I'm not going to change nothing here.

[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:52.980]
I will say this.

[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:56.440]
The Florida election, I think, in 2004 is going to be the pivotal deal again.

[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.000]
Exactly.

[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.880]
And you know, you have a voice that we don't have.

[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:03.560]
And you can get out there and you can tell us what's going on.

[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:04.340]
Okay.

[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:06.300]
You know, I have a full-time job.

[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:09.740]
I don't have time to scour and read all these articles.

[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.960]
And when you were reading them, it's awesome.

[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:15.920]
The fact that you're reading the Michael Moore book is fantastic.

[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:19.120]
And I enjoy it every day in our listen every single day while I work.

[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.120]
Thank God for us, Pally.

[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:23.040]
Thank God for us with a brain larger than our small toe.

[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:23.880]
There's a few of us.

[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:24.520]
You're the man.

[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:24.660]
Yes.

[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:25.500]
Have a great day.

[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:25.780]
Thank you.

[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:26.640]
Today we go on our second.

[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:29.580]
Here's one of those in between all the other, 40 or 50.

[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:30.340]
You're gay.

[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.200]
You're a pervert.

[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:32.200]
You know, all this other stuff.

[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:32.580]
You know.

[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.780]
From when it's after 11 and 560 W.D.C.M.,

[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:39.140]
and don't try to like use me or any other faggot there to cover up the Michael Jackson business,

[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:43.340]
don't try to play that game, okay, because the fact that it matters is that we're talking serious here

[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:48.280]
between Michael and the priest, Samuel Crabbe, Dylan around 8 and 10 and 12 year old boys,

[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.540]
and the answer is unacceptable.

[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.700]
Unacceptable, Michael, there he is now on a BBC.

[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:56.820]
While his supporters claimed there were so many friends and staff at the ranch,

[00:58:56.820 --> 00:59:01.860]
any impropriety would be noticed, the singer used a TV address to proclaim his innocence.

[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:04.620]
These statements about me are totally false.

[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:05.320]
No.

[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:09.880]
Today, the Lisa expected to give more details about this latest investigation.

[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:12.620]
The singers promised them his full cooperation.

[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:13.940]
Don't you love the BBC?

[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.060]
I mean, it's opposed to that.

[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:17.140]
I'm not even watching CNN normal.

[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:20.420]
Because if anything happens, the world BBC heaven right away.

[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:24.140]
We won't miss anything, but at least at least though, when there's a story they like, you know,

[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:28.020]
no matter what it is, as opposed to like, I don't want to hear about Scott and Lisa.

[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:29.860]
Peterson, no, Mo, do you want to hear about that?

[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:30.460]
No.

[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.440]
No, Mo, he did it in Fry's ass.

[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:32.900]
That's all.

[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.320]
I don't you think he done it, Tommy?

[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:35.920]
Yes.

[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:37.860]
I think so, George thing.

[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:38.420]
So that's it.

[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:40.700]
You're convicted by a jury of your queer peers, and that's it.

[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:41.080]
You're done.

[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:42.420]
Scott, Fry's ass.

[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:44.480]
See how simple I was?

[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:45.800]
Didn't cross the taxpayers a dime.

[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.320]
1113 at 560 WDQM survey.

[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:49.020]
You like the reading?

[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:51.200]
You like that Al Franken book and colder?

[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:52.100]
Bill O'Reilly?

[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:52.900]
What do you say?

[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:54.180]
What say you folks out there?

[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:55.140]
You got anything to say?

[00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:55.440]
No.

[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:55.980]
We know that.

[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.040]
Give it a ball.

[00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:57.520]
Give me the ball.

[00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:02.860]

You a...

[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:14.700]
Music

[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.600]
Music

[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.560]
The freak going Debbie Rowe got married down under.

[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:25.240]
Did they make hot monkey love?

[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.700]
I can't help but wonder talking about wacko.

[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:29.780]
Chaco.

[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:30.400]
Chaco.

[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.000]
Michael, Michael, got wet.

[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.840]
Megan loved to Debbie Rowe with a lullaby in their bed.

[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:46.140]
Debbie's been ejected with a seat from Michael's loin.

[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:50.900]
When the baby pops right out, he'll have a drop tan on his groin.

[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.360]
That's because wacko.

[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:53.380]
Chaco.

[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:53.940]
Chaco.

[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.500]
Michael, Michael, had sex.

[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.420]
Debbie said she'll be his wife.

[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.140]
Just keep writing those checks.

[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:01.420]
Love an 18.

[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:02.420]
He might have to write it.

[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:03.760]
I guess he didn't write the real big one.

[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.200]
Is that the problem with this 12-year-old kid?

[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:06.680]
Well, they're still working that out.

[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:07.780]
They're still negotiating.

[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:09.500]
Maybe that's why they're cops in there right now.

[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:11.260]
They're going to use it like as a lever.

[01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:11.740]
Right.

[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.160]
These people say they won't be bought off.

[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:14.840]
Is that what they're saying?

[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:15.340]
That's the guy.

[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:16.860]
There wasn't a guy at Dennis.

[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:19.380]
The other kid said, he wasn't going to be bought off either.

[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:22.220]
But then when he saw all of them zeros on there, he said, oh, wow.

[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:23.500]
Now we're talking business.

[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:25.880]
Okay, what do we got on this first survey?

[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.500]
Which Whitney Schmidt candidate here pretty soon?

[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.500]
283 votes.

[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.940]
What's your take on game marriages?

[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.080]
Absolutely.

[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:32.240]
Everyone should have equal rights.

[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.760]
123.43.4%.

[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.660]
Why should I care?

[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:37.500]
71.25%.

[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.280]
So you put those two together.

[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.920]
You got like 60, almost 69.

[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:41.800]
Uh-oh.

[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.360]
Civil unions are okay, but not marriage.

[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:46.380]
39.

[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:49.300]
I think what they're trying to say to her is marriage sucks.

[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:50.300]
And I'm sure you can probably.

[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:53.560]
And the marriage is not a civil union, by the way.

[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:55.820]
Now, it's uncivilized against no question.

[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:58.100]
No way God didn't create Adam and Steve.

[01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:58.800]
29.

[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:02.020]
10% of the audience says God didn't create the Lord didn't create Adam and Steve.

[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.100]
It was Adam and Jack.

[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.260]
And only for members of the priesthood, 21.

[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:08.860]
How to tune in 83 votes.

[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.200]
So that's, uh, fairly, I don't know what, what do you call it?

[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:13.720]
Pinellar.

[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.140]
Anyway, here's the, yes, it's done.

[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.740]
I want to get to the second poll.

[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.280]
Britney says I'm a fine role model.

[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:23.220]
Despite all her nudity and her ravine outfits and her new album with sexually-exposalers,

[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:25.500]
she said, all little girls ought to be just like me.

[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:26.380]
She's fine.

[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.580]
Hot and rich.

[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.340]
In a regular interview to be broadcast, the 21-year-old pop star said parents should not be worried

[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:33.600]
if their children want to copy her.

[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.900]
They like to be just like Britney.

[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:35.940]
I'll be honest with her.

[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.020]
This picture here, her push-down look all that good.

[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.100]
She's got bad angles.

[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:41.620]
Does that it?

[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:42.220]
That ankles?

[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.380]
We can't see your ankles, but you can't see your hands.

[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:45.200]
So that's just fine.

[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:45.700]
Bad ankles.

[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:48.260]
I probably have more older fans than the younger ones.

[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:51.240]
She said, yeah, probably one of the 70-year-old guys in there.

[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.600]
Look at this picture, just go on crazy.

[01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:00.860]
Probably a little older fans than the younger ones, but I think the reason why everyone talks about the younger fans so much is because the parents are concerned.

[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.040]
And in the end.

[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:02.960]
In the end.

[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.580]
You can't say that sweetheart.

[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:08.880]
In the end, they shouldn't be concerned because they should trust their kids.

[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:09.980]
Spears said.

[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.720]
Something about spearing in the end.

[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.120]
Five minutes, I think.

[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.560]
The five-minute major in a game is conduct.

[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.820]
She also defended recent magazine photos.

[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:21.460]
I was saying I just recently done some covers that are a little bit explicit and sexy.

[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:24.580]
A lot of people do think this is very overexplicit, but that's their opinion.

[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.320]
And some people think it's under-explicit.

[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.700]
Right. Some people want you to be at all, sweetheart, like right now.

[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:34.580]
Spears who kissed Madonna at the MTV video music awards also talked about her relationship with the singer.

[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.460]
She's like my godmother in a way.

[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.740]
I don't listen to that many people.

[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.940]
I'm a very stubborn person when something tells me not to do something I do it.

[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.340]
That's just my rebellious nature.

[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.260]
She said, that's why she stuck her tongue deep down, her down is true.

[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:49.600]
Even after Christina Aguilara had hers and they were in her tongue too.

[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.700]
Exactly. And after Dennis Rodman had something there as well.

[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.700]
You can ponder on that for a while.

[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.240]
Not all the list green in the world could read.

[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:01.760]
Even forget about list green. How about Mr. Clean?

[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:02.740]
Even that wouldn't do it.

[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.620]
Here's our second poll of the day, which I think is kind of interesting.

[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.760]
Tomorrow we'll do the guys, so to speak.

[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.940]
Can I say we'll do the guys and I'll just listen.

[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:11.380]
Okay.

[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:19.100]
Paul, see I would put on playboy TV, but we got so unlucky that time.

[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.100]
Yeah, I don't want to practice on your finger.

[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.680]
Oh, see? No, no, that was okay.

[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.080]
Wasn't that fine?

[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.660]
Don't put your logic on here.

[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.540]
Like she wants a swirl or tongue around the head.

[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.460]
Okay, and that's fine.

[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.320]
He does it.

[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.840]
No, she didn't say easy does it.

[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:34.260]
I know.

[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.580]
Heavy, heavy duty is what she's doing.

[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.460]
She's twirling that thing around in her finger too.

[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:42.180]
Anyway, what famous living person would you like to think is a role model for your daughter?

[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:45.020]
If you had one, in other words, if you have daughters, fine, but even if you don't have one,

[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.720]
that don't exclude you.

[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:50.900]
Just pretend that your daughter was Brittany and she was about 25.

[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.520]
And she, anyway, here's our list so far.

[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.200]
Brittany Spears.

[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.480]
Obviously we got to put her on here because she says she's a fine role model.

[01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.440]
That's what she says.

[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:00.220]
Oprah?

[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:06.540]
I don't think most people want their daughter to look like Oprah, but they like them to be a billionaire, right?

[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:06.900]
Sure.

[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:13.420]
And very famous and admired and unmarried and fat and fat and disgusting and neurotic.

[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:14.800]
Maria Schreiber.

[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:16.920]
She's the wife of the governor of California.

[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:19.140]
Hillary Clinton.

[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:20.780]
Hillary Clinton, the ice princess.

[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.920]
Who won't want their daughter to be frigid?

[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.600]
Georgia's choice was Jocelyn Elders, the former secretary of H.H.S.S.W.

[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:29.860]
whatever the hell it is these days, right?

[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:33.840]
Who had a resign because the right wingers got all bad out of shape just because she said

[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:39.400]
that masturbation wasn't so bad and talked about condoms and stuff like that and talking honestly to kids about sex and they said,

[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.760]
oh no, you can't do that.

[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:42.900]
All right, wingers had an nervous breakdown about poor Jocelyn.

[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:49.180]
And columnist Maureen Dowd, who of course puts a lot of tough words in her stories just to screw me up, but we love Maureen Dowd.

[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:51.280]
We are proud of Ms. Dowd.

[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:53.840]
I also wrote on their Natalie Maid's and Susan Sarandon just because...

[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:54.780]
Susan?

[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:58.860]
Well, don't put too many on here because you'll steal the audience's thunder.

[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:01.460]
Susan Sarandon and Natalie, who?

[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.080]
Means the Dixie Chick.

[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.600]
Oh, well, I don't know their names, the Dixie Chick.

[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:06.880]
Well, she's the one with the mouth.

[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:07.920]
Is she the main one?

[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:08.680]
That's right.

[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.880]
Okay, Natalie means...

[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:11.480]
She got fat.

[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.800]
And Susan Sarandon.

[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:13.320]
That's all right.

[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.260]
She still got that.

[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.220]
And Dixie Chick, we're going to show them a thing or two.

[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:24.140]
Okay, then, Dixie Chick, we're going to take off all their music and not sell them under them records in the store and MCDs and stuff and then we're going to show them a thing or two.

[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.300]
Not going to our president.

[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:26.760]
Yeah.

[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.680]
Not going to our president who just left London.

[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:32.440]
He's back up in the tree in Aintry now playing the strumming of Anjo.

[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.100]
Oh, you talk about the usual deer in the headlights look he's got.

[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:36.520]
Oh, brother.

[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:37.960]
The stuff that they've been showing here.

[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.180]
He talked about a fish out of water.

[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:40.840]
Wow.

[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:49.420]
He doesn't know whether the strut or put on his goulashes or his fedora or is killed for that matter.

[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:50.700]
Wouldn't that be great if...

[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:51.820]
Ooh, don't say it.

[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:52.780]
No, not...

[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:53.440]
Oh, right.

[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:54.320]
Just let it go.

[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.200]
Now, walk away.

[01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:56.440]
Here's a couple of facts.

[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.080]
This one says, you might be surprised there are a lot of people love when you read those articles.

[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.100]
I'm surprised.

[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:01.780]
I am.

[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:02.500]
I can't believe it.

[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:02.960]
I'm at work.

[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:03.520]
Two jobs.

[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.360]
Don't have time to read.

[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.000]
Keep up the good work.

[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:05.300]
Thanks.

[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.120]
And what is that name?

[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.160]
Javan.

[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:07.680]
Javan?

[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.000]
Oh, it's...

[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:11.440]
No, it is.

[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:13.160]
It's a Jamaican because it says at the bottom.

[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.520]
It does say that.

[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.400]
So it's Javan, the Jamaican.

[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:17.880]
Javan, thank you.

[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:19.640]
Also, this other one, which you...

[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:23.100]
Are you just going to send me all the facts that the same person sends you to keep looking my ass?

[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.860]
Only if they promote the reading.

[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:25.460]
Oh.

[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.860]
It says, oh, I see.

[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:30.220]
So in other words, this is going to be a skewed, a helter-skeltered skewed pole.

[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:31.600]
Hate the calls.

[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:32.740]
Love you, Neil.

[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.380]
Keep talking.

[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:34.140]
Don't retire.

[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:34.860]
Is what it said.

[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:36.260]
I'd like to retire this week.

[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.220]
I'm tired of it.

[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.380]
You're retired.

[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:39.860]
Actually, I'm not.

[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.660]
Actually, I feel pretty good because I'm hearing I'm not there.

[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:42.460]
The week that I was there.

[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.860]
Well, I picked the right week, I guess, with all the crap going on.

[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:45.780]
You know how to do it.

[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.240]
I sure know how to pick a man.

[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.560]
My timing has been impeccable.

[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:52.540]
I come down here and for all gets canned and all this other crap is going down.

[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:55.140]
Oh, brother, what a loony tune plays that was.

[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.600]
And then, of course, sitting there for a week without other Scott.

[01:08:57.940 --> 01:08:58.240]
Wow.

[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.640]
The audience, there's no way we could explain it.

[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.900]
Unless you've encountered sometimes somewhere in your life, a creature of that nature, of that origin.

[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:10.240]
You just, we just can't explain it to you.

[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:13.540]
One of those people, you say, where are they hiding the ship?

[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:15.080]
We don't clap, can't hide it in the basement.

[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.700]
Where are they hiding the ship?

[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:17.980]
And when did they get off it?

[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:18.920]
And when did they go in the back?

[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:20.060]
Man.

[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:21.080]
Scott Jr.

[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:24.600]
He was, he made Bina Boy seem like Emily Post.

[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:26.180]
Tope.

[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:27.100]
Refined.

[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.080]
Oh, she was like the...

[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:28.660]
That's the idiot lady.

[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.480]
Yeah, she also was on a serial box.

[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:34.040]
26 past 11 at 560 WQM.

[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:34.560]
So what do you think?

[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:36.640]
I think we'll get some of names on that list, don't you?

[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:37.180]
No.

[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.240]
And don't answer the phone time we were doing screamless now.

[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:41.000]
Is Miguel coming back or is he just walked out?

[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:43.400]
He threatened to come back as soon as Todd's done with him.

[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.520]
As soon as Todd's done doing him.

[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:47.860]
Hey, Todd, I know about the other stuff, but I know about that.

[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:53.780]
I didn't know Todd was into those things.

[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.520]
Todd did say he'd like our polo.

[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.100]
Hey, imagine this, speaking of Todd Dreck.

[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.320]
Zero closing cost on your next mortgage.

[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:05.240]
Zero application fee, zero credit bureau fee, zero discounted points.

[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:06.960]
It's the last mortgage you'll ever need.

[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.720]
The revolutionary only one mortgage from financial group.

[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:13.860]
Now with an interest rate, amazingly astonishingly breathtaking the low of just 1.95%.

[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.760]
That means if you have a $200,000 loan, your payments are a mere

[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:19.660]
$738 a month.

[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.200]
Once you be financed, you're getting a new home mortgage from financial group.

[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.920]
I guarantee you, you'll never pay closing cost again.

[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.260]
You want to find out more about it?

[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:27.980]
Call 1-800-940-Lind.

[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.860]
Grab yourself real financing power.

[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:30.360]
Grab it.

[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:33.500]
With the low rate mortgage, you can move to your next property with a further cost of expense.

[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.280]
Only one mortgage from financial group is what we're talking about.

[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.460]
For details, it's 1-800-940-Lind.

[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.500]
It's a whole new way to buy.

[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:46.000]
Zero underwriting fee, zero doc, fee, zero prepayment penalty, zero closing cost, even when you move to another property.

[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:46.800]
How can you beat that?

[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.740]
So get financing at just 1.95%.

[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:54.320]
Call 1-800-940-Lind and never, ever, never pay closing cost again.

[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.760]
Call 1-800-940-Lind.

[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:03.000]
Either an equal housing lender, restrictions apply, rates subject to change monthly 5.19 APR.

[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:04.820]
My life and loss.

[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:07.220]
This is 420560.

[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:08.960]
The way to weigh.

[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:12.700]
Gementich, I am a pussy.

[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:17.960]
Still a king of power.

[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:20.200]
I'm telling you.

[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.120]
I can still get down.

[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:26.020]
I can still say, oh, to where that glow.

[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000]
I proud of it too.

[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:30.840]
And the little kid.

[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:32.300]
Cause we love them too.

[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.980]
But now it days it's different.

[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.180]
Especially when I dance and move on.

[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.060]
Cause if I move around too much.

[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:41.200]
Take the place you're spending far off.

[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:42.300]
And say, I'm back.

[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:43.380]
I'm back.

[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:45.260]
Still move to the prove you know.

[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.500]
Oh yeah, I'm back.

[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:47.580]
I'm back.

[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.420]
Do the spade in my lower back.

[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:50.680]
You know I'm back.

[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:51.740]
I'm back.

[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.140]
Get a king of power.

[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:53.720]
Cause back.

[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.260]
When a pamphlet rim begins to run back.

[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.880]
Cause in my free month days, we're back.

[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:58.440]
I'm back.

[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.380]
Number 32-560-WD-Q.

[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:02.320]
I'm a bad dog at 2.00-A-Humper at 4.

[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.940]
And then you got your panthers preview at 7 o'clock tonight.

[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:08.160]
Cause the panthers are home against the New York Islanders.

[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:08.680]
New York.

[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.900]
The Islanders, not who are not that bad this year.

[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:11.280]
They're okay.

[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.960]
At 7.30 and then 80K after the hockey game.

[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:14.720]
Jo and Marco were night.

[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.240]
And of course my close personal friend.

[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:16.660]
Absolutely.

[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:17.620]
Yolte in the morning.

[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:19.880]
Let's see.

[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:23.480]
Lorelistner faxes and says tonight at 9 o'clock on the Sundance Channel.

[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:27.720]
A documentary about the 2000 presidential theft will be on.

[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:30.060]
I found this to be as chilling a documentary as I've ever seen.

[01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:34.140]
While I didn't see the CBC broadcast, I heard it on your show and feel a bit of the same quality.

[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:38.040]
Please urge as many people as you can to see this tape it and pass it on.

[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:40.460]
Hey, see it tape it and pass it on.

[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:42.080]
Glad you mentioned that.

[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:43.560]
What?

[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:44.700]
Glad you mentioned that.

[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.060]
That tape that you played.

[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:46.720]
Yeah.

[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:47.520]
Twice.

[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.520]
I'm still writing comments on that from people.

[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:49.960]
Positive.

[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:50.400]
Are you really?

[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:50.600]
Yeah.

[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:51.180]
I'll see.

[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.120]
I thought they hated that stuff.

[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:54.880]
Well, I don't know.

[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:55.880]
It's hard to read this crowd.

[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.700]
I just think that one for all of our can on Wednesday.

[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.500]
The QM just.

[01:12:58.720 --> 01:12:59.580]
That was the end of us.

[01:12:59.580 --> 01:12:59.940]
We're finished.

[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:00.860]
They're not hard to read.

[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:01.360]
Huh?

[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.240]
They're not hard to read.

[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:02.640]
Remember?

[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:04.220]
Whatever.

[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:05.180]
I suggest the latter.

[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:05.700]
I don't know.

[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:05.700]

[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:07.360]
It's just because so few people get the sun dance channel.

[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.260]
Everybody needs to see it.

[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:10.600]
I sure is how long I don't think I get no sun dance channel.

[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.500]
I don't even know what that is.

[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.120]
I don't think so.

[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.840]
It's one of the movie channels actually.

[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:14.200]
It's.

[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:14.520]
It is.

[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:15.220]
I don't know.

[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:15.440]
It's.

[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:15.680]
Yeah.

[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:17.700]
Do I get the sun dance in my pants?

[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:18.320]
Probably do.

[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:19.000]
We get it.

[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:19.460]
I get it.

[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:21.540]
What do you mean you probably do?

[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:25.200]
Because it's a movie channel that you get most of the movie channels like HBO Showtime.

[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:25.500]
No.

[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:26.640]
No, we don't.

[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.180]
No, I don't.

[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.040]
I got a whole bunch of other movie channel like Bravo.

[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:31.720]
Sundances like the independent film.

[01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:54.060]
I get it.

[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.700]
I get it.

[01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:56.820]

[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:57.420]
I get it.

[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:57.920]
I get it.

[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:58.020]
I get it.

[01:13:58.020 --> 01:13:58.480]
I get it.

[01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:58.600]
I get it.

[01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:58.640]
I get it.

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.640]

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:58.980]
I get it.

[01:13:58.980 --> 01:13:59.300]
I get it.

[01:13:59.300 --> 01:13:59.560]
I get it.

[01:13:59.760 --> 01:13:59.940]
I get it.

[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:01.560]
I get it.

[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:01.720]
What is this?

[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:02.080]
He's just died.

[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:06.500]
Oh no.

[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:16.660]
My TV just throws up and the whole thing just the whole mechanism here just you know what I'm

[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:16.820]
saying.

[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:18.920]
That's not a good old man.

[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:19.700]
Anyways, all fine.

[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:21.160]
If I had this sun of hell or not.

[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.080]
That might be the beginning of a communist plot.

[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:23.580]
You think so?

[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:23.980]
Come on.

[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:24.600]
We're going to the end of the world.

[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:25.400]
Okay.

[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.380]
Let's smit-can this other.

[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:27.960]
A poll here.

[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:28.700]
Eric.

[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:36.120]
We have three hundred and what three forty six and I see that the alunis out there got to a red

[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:39.340]
The other good thing we're getting to solve it there. What's your take on game marriage?

[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:46.920]
Absolutely everybody should have equal rights 147 42 and a percent why should I care 88 25 and a half percent put those two together

[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:48.640]
They got about 68 percent

[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.760]
Civil unions are okay, but not marriage mr. 45

[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:58.680]
No marriages no way God didn't create Adam and Steve 38 and only for members of the

[01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:02.200]
priesthood 28 of 353 they're pouring in now

[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:09.480]
God didn't create Adam and Steve okay Adam and Steve he created a man and a woman which of course is why we want all our women to like

[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.820]
Bend over a doogie style and back home. Yeah

[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:15.740]
Okay, see that argument. I think went out the old window you know, I mean

[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.100]
Once all you guys started getting obsessed with that anal crap

[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:22.100]
I never argued the point and there's nothing worse than anal crap

[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:28.060]
Mark says I want to thank you for your reading list and thoroughly enjoying Franken's book on lies and lies to tell them the chapter on

[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:33.380]
Bitch slapping Goldberg. That's not Hank. That's Bernard Goldberg on his book and like a facts

[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:36.460]
I hope you keep reading excerpts from it each day. I'm a little ahead of where you are

[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:37.960]
So it's fun to go over it again

[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:42.820]
Every Democrat and government should be required to read this book the way they can go into talking to chose arm

[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:47.260]
It's time to go after the lying right wing my next book to read is hey dude. That's not hey dude

[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:54.480]
It's hey Jude dude. Where's my country? And that's the the what is it? The book on the house of South and how we protect them

[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:59.540]
It says Oprah had her book club. Why can't you have yours? You're not even as fat as she is says Mark

[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:02.960]
No, I'm not as fat and not as rich and nobody. Oh listen to the show no more

[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:07.440]
Hector says this is cute on the subject game marriage as a friend of mine's a divorce attorney

[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:11.020]
He's thrilled about gays getting married not because of my friend being open-minded

[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:13.880]
But he can't wait for the divorce procedures to start good point Hector

[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:20.880]
It'd be a cottage industry as they say at the old cottage in cottage country anyway getting back to the story I started a half an hour ago

[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.080]
Yeah, W.I.M.

[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:27.300]
Yeah, sir. How you doing?

[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:33.220]
I'm why you don't know how franken's book I've already read right when you get to this part about

[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:37.800]
This about Bob's news and British, right? You know they try to try to

[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:43.300]
This was Indian guys that every time you bring up the subject that Clinton had a chance to get been live and then do it

[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:45.380]
Mm-hmm. Just got named Margaritza

[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:49.600]
With box call of them on affairs experts

[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:54.860]
When you get to that chapter in the book about that reason the answer to your audience about this guy

[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:58.480]
This guy's so full of crap that he wouldn't believe it. How did he?

[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.620]
It's probably a pseudodemean government and

[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:06.960]
This reason I just want to pray that little sense because I really don't have that much material

[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:10.520]
But I want to begin to that sense about my three jobs. That's the same

[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:14.740]
Okay, you can let your listeners know about this guy that Bob news right to parade out there

[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:19.120]
Asked a foreign affairs expert and he's the one that saying Clinton had a chance

[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:24.280]
That I was trying to broke up there between the suit needs government and Clinton to bring in been live

[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:29.020]
It's a home to the hard watch man. So you're not saying that Fox is unfair and unbalanced or you

[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:34.220]
You can read that past and see your girl your listeners

[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:37.320]
I'll only look for it during the break. I look for maybe I'll do it today

[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.780]
Okay, all right, thanks pali. Have a great time

[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:46.960]
Even gelacles are for more likely to stay homosexuals can change

[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:52.520]
Catholics and mainline Protestants fall in the middle and more secular people are most likely to say they cannot change since Scott

[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:57.240]
Keter a poster with Pew Research Center for the people in the press the people in the press

[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:03.040]
The survey reinforced the finding that religious attitude sharply affect feelings on gaze and gay behavior

[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:09.680]
Those are the high level religious commitment opposed gay marriage 80 to 12 percent the poll found that opposition to gay marriage has grown since mid-summer

[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:15.680]
With 32 percent in favor in 59 percent opposing in July 53 percent said they oppose the now 59 quarter this

[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:21.860]
Political attitudes sharply affected beliefs about gay marriage. What a surprise. Aren't you shocked? No

[01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:29.640]
Four and five of those who say they would vote to reelect president Bush opposed gay marriage while those who prefer that a Democrat when the presidency are evenly split fitty-fitty

[01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:37.200]
Younger and I see here's what I don't understand about young people 18 to 30 really young compared to me. I mean

[01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:44.380]
60 percent are bush liquors. Okay. They're the biggest demographic of people who support Bush great watch

[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:48.880]
But on the no but on the issues they don't agree see if they make any sense to me

[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:56.000]
Younger adults were far more likely to say they favor gay marriage and those between ages 20 and 30 about evenly split on

[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:57.800]
favoring or posing it

[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:04.080]
Opposition grew steadily as people age increased among those they waited here this among those in the 60s and 70s

[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:09.520]
Opponents on number supporters by more than four to one the old fogees man setting their ways. Oh

[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:14.980]
No, we can't have them faggots getting married enough to children stuff like that. We're gonna go to hell and I had basket

[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:20.520]
That's hand basket rhymes with casket you'll be seeing one soon

[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:25.820]
Americans with college degrees were closely divided on a question of gay marriage 49 percent oppose 44 percent in favor

[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:31.300]
In other words a younger and more educated people say a lot of hell not and older and stuffy or in more right-wing people say

[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:38.660]
No, no, the Bible says this and you're gonna write in hell is what they say much like what they say kind of like for out you're gonna write in hell, baby

[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:41.280]
Let's bring them back for a couple of weeks

[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.940]
I'll go get it the survey now what we need him because we're a tourist man

[01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:47.640]
I'm telling you we got some real problems here

[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:51.600]
And I don't think that the powers that be are aware of it. They're they're still basking the glory of that marlins month

[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.380]
That October that phony month, you know all the sports shows man sports talk is where I said I don't think so

[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.520]
I don't think so it's pretty damn boring

[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:04.320]
The survey found the public is moved toward widespread opposition against discrimination generally against homosexuals

[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:09.840]
Despite the opposition to gay marriage now. Here's another good when I love this and I feel so guilty now

[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:12.800]
Not you now you understand I've ever done anything I

[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:18.920]
Just think about it. I say most Americans 55% say they feel that homosexuality is a sin

[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:25.000]
While 33% disagree 55% of America, which is why America continues being in the stone age

[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.060]
Far far behind the rest of the civilized supposedly civilized and educated world

[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:35.360]
55% it's a sin 33% say nay. What would you get if you asked those same Americans about lesbianism?

[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:38.660]
Oh, they like it. All right. Where can they see it? Mm-hmm?

[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:42.420]
10 highly committed. Oh, here you go 9 and 10 highly committed

[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:48.480]
They should be committed white evangelicals and nearly three quarters of black protest and say homosexual behaviors are sin

[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:51.760]
Oh the Lord done it the Lord done it. He saved me from my self

[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:57.020]
How do you like that? I mean America you just look at what it's made up of man

[01:20:57.020 --> 01:21:02.640]
I don't want to use the word morons, but they're sure a lot of running out of the loose. Okay. We got that other pull up there now with

[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.620]
I say Brittany if I had a daughter I

[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:09.220]
Like to have her just like Brittany. Hey, we'll only one exception. Don't bring Justin home

[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:11.300]
right

[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.380]
No, can you imagine all the hot looking?

[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:18.340]
You can't pick a shoes. You got to take the good with the bad. I see well

[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.960]
Accompanying but I don't know I'm starting to do that was money. That was funny stuff

[01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:52.320]
What the book the Al Franken's okay now? What is the one? He's talking about Fox something with

[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:56.080]
What one is that I?

[01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:58.960]
Attend the White House correspondent dinner with and

[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:03.620]
Annoy Carl Roe v. Pearl Paul Wolfitz and the entire Fox News team, but that's not it

[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:09.720]
I'm looking at the various chapters near to try the our friend that called earlier the chapter on Fox that might be it

[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:12.200]
Chapter on page 58. Let me just take a look

[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:19.680]
What nothing well? No, I was whole thing about Rupert Murdock and Roger Ailes and all of these other far buss and a right wing assholes

[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:24.980]
But there might be a thing in here that he's talking about about the Indian guy the Indian guy

[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.400]
Then he had on his the guest talking about the

[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.620]
Chainscape of Osama Yamama

[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.680]
Don't don't say what's Dodd

[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:38.500]
If any program on a Fox line up represents the network's credo fair and balanced

[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:41.360]
It's got to be what has been called the highest rated show on television

[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:46.660]
Hannity and combs. He's got handy in big print and combs and little teeny tiny letters

[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:56.080]
Every everywhere he presented here. He's got handy with big letters and combs and little tiny letters and for example

[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.700]
His chapter on Hannity and combs, which is after the little righty one

[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:06.720]
He says he says Colmes rhetoric and every time he writes to Alan or Colmes, it's in little tiny letters

[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:12.760]
Colmes rhetoric may not be fiery, but at least there's not much of it and the state of the Union show team Frank and did a little

[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.140]
rudimentary content analysis

[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:17.280]
They counted how many words and it he said and then they counted how many words

[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:21.360]
Combs said in tiny letters then we compared them Hannity and huge letters

[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:25.380]
2086 combs and little tiny letters 1261

[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:30.920]
So there you go. I haven't found the other thing and I don't want to do it on here

[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:36.460]
I'll do it while I'm playing all I'm bit stirring I wanted to our dean leads carry a new Hampshire Democrat primary

[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:43.420]
Howard Dean extended his double digit lead over rival John carry among luxury voters in New Hampshire's Democratic presidential primary

[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:46.320]
Accorded away pulled a choked Wesley Clark losing ground

[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:51.220]
Oh general if he'd hang out more with the mainstream people instead of the old Jews at the delis

[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:52.760]
He might be getting a little more support, you know

[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.080]
Although they're primarily our committee delis in New Hampshire

[01:27:56.780 --> 01:28:01.920]
Dean the former Vermont governor was favored by 39% of Democrats and independence planning to vote in the January 27

[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:08.860]
Primer Carrie had the back in the 23 39 23 and the pull by Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion

[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:12.860]
The other candidates were in single digits 14 undecided 14 percent

[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:21.040]
Single digits so when New Hampshire's a tourist race 39% for Dean and 23% for the scary John Kerry

[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:28.240]
Oh, I love this story. Well, I don't love this story, but I mean just I wonder I wonder who wrote the book of love

[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:34.280]
Palm Beach this is from the Sun Sentinel no less which we rarely even waste our time with us two fish rappers in South Florida

Palm Beach County woman faces eight to 16 years in prison for having sex with a 13-year-old boy. Are you familiar with this story? No?

[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:49.860]
Now obviously it's you know not kosher having sex with a 13-year-old boy even a 12-year-old boy is Michaels about to find out but eight to 16 years in prison

[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.720]
You think that might be just a little heavy duty a

[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:59.040]
Little bit a mother of three. Well, how much what would you say six or seven?

[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:08.540]
Okay, a mother of three pleaded guilty yesterday to having sex with a 13-year-old boy and supplying alcohol to other teenagers who regularly hung out at her house

[01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:11.800]
Wester Lake worthwhile her husband was at work. Oh

[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:12.760]

Amy Dwayne 37 agreed to a plea deal at a leave her in the fate in the hands of Palm Beach County circuit judge Jack Cook

[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:25.420]
She faces eight to 16 and a half years in prison under state sentencing guidelines

[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:32.260]
Sheriff detectives arrested Dwayne a data entry processor in elementary school and her friend debris far of a

[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:37.720]
Girl Scouts register in May after both women admitted having sexual contact with boys at Dwayne's home

[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:38.960]
According to court records

[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:44.180]
Neighborhood junior high and high school students told authorities that the two women allowed them to drink and smoke at the

[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:48.320]
Pinyon Drive House when Duane's husband a firefighter wasn't around but wait there's more

[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:57.060]
Yeah, what does that mean the drink and smoke and we'll get to it just relax

[01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:02.080]
It's calm down. You're like her husband right here. You're holding that hose too tight

[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:07.160]
Dwayne first told investigators that she and the victim were really good friends but later professed her love for the boy

[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:11.460]
Dwayne maintained that she had sex with the victim this business like a throwback. What was that brought in?

[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:14.540]
Very Kate let her know there you go

[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:20.860]
She maintained she had sex with the victim once but the teenager indicated the sexual relationship might have started up when he was 12

[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:28.140]
According to BS oh reports are not Palm Beach County the teenager told authorities they had sex at least three times

[01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:29.400]
But who's counting?

[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:34.380]
Apparently he was the victims mother set Tuesday that Dwayne a woman they had considered a good neighbor had an ongoing

[01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:39.220]
Sexual relationship with her son the family is still trying to heal from the damage done by Duane the mother said the

Sun sent was not publishing the name of the mother prevent identifying the victim a juvenile

[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:47.640]
The mother said she approved of the plea deal because she's sent in one to go to court and she didn't want him to go through the

[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:48.780]
embarrassment of a trial

[01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:53.600]
Duane didn't speak at any length at her court hearing as she pleaded guilty to a single kind of ludor

Drinking agent Ontario here is 19

[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:08.880]
I just mentioned that in passing okay as part of the plea deal probably don't you think it's a little more realistic than 21?

[01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:13.600]
Yeah as part of the plea deal prosecuted is agreed to drop a second kind of ludor Lasbias

[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:17.080]
Behave battery she declined to talk as she left the courtroom with her attorney

[01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:24.780]
Let's see well there you go. It's got some more comments the attorney said this and this one said that but that's the story

[01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:28.660]
I mean obviously a grotesque unacceptable act but

[01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:35.400]
8 to 16 and a half years now if it comes to fight out Michael Jackson is convicted of having sex with a 12-year-old boy how many years

[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:38.520]

[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:46.800]

Yeah, any special reason

[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:54.360]
No, I just think that any any more of the way

[01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:58.460]
Society's gone. She's a typical prototype woman

[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:02.580]
Okay, husband cheats on her taking care of her kids

[01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:08.380]

Okay, there you go

[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:24.120]
Nicole Kidman for you know kind of like mixed reason nothing too exciting. It's not like all that enthused about a day

[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:30.220]
No, oh five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T. Let's build this list. Let's go

[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:33.780]
Let's go. I know that date counties all out of business this week. Everybody's out of there

[01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:37.420]
They're all hiding. That's why one of the reasons we're not getting the usual response we get on our website

[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:39.520]
All the people in data like gone in hiding

[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:46.420]
TV they're famous to Broward and stay in hotels. Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised at most of the hotels the motels in the broward

[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:52.460]
The hotel's we yeah, no, certainly when you imagine that they're loaded. I would imagine because tons of people are like working in

[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:57.300]
Broward who ordinarily are working and living in day. They're just they got that loud and anticipation of government

[01:37:57.300 --> 01:38:01.340]
It was what a at the FDA a lots of visitors from out of town

[01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:06.880]
You know with the media that's covering it lots of people there to get their push on TV and make a big sauna dance

[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.680]
And they're all I'm not knocking them because I happen to agree with them

[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:14.060]
But the fact of the matter is the way that they want to accomplish their ends ain't going to get the job done

[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:16.900]
Right right and my main

[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:21.520]
Feelings are what those poor bastards who are in business trying to equal living out who had a clothes down their shops

[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:25.620]
And board off the windows and the van moves to Broward or Palm Beach where would he'll he went and

[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:29.700]
Hope that when they come back to fight everything's still in one piece. That's that's not a way to live, you know

[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:31.940]
If you want to protest go

[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:37.980]
Throw a rotten tomatoes at the government do so go to Washington don't let come to Miami. We already got enough to risk man

[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:38.660]
We survived alien

[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:45.380]
We survived the hang in chads. I've got that t-shirt. We survived the joker rollo. I mean for Kranala

[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:48.760]
We're even surviving me or pinga picanha. Why do you want to do this to us? Huh?

[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:50.660]
So I feel for them people

[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:52.780]
W Q a m hello

[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:54.060]
You knew

[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:59.040]
Yes, sir. Why would you let me let him clear and put that on your website during the 14 year old kid?

[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:01.760]
No, were you cut the crap cut the baloney

[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:03.740]
W Q a m hello

[01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:04.380]
Yeah

[01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:06.520]
Talk to me. Oh speaking

[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:15.080]
Yeah, yes, sir. Have you seen that five-part thing that's going on the history channel about the possibility of

[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:17.760]
Lvj kill Kennedy. Yes

[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:24.040]
I don't know if you're mentioning it has been over the last couple of days and that it really leads to the fact

[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:30.040]
Ha, we're not here controlling our own destinies in this country. That's for damn sure, man

[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:37.120]
And um, I just want to want to bring it up because in case some people have a scene that is the fact that

[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:42.240]
We can't trust none of them. Well, there's there's a book on that I forget what the name of the book was

[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:45.480]
It was really just uh not that long ago. I'll find out

[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:46.580]
Yeah, well

[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:51.140]
And I learned you're reading the story because when the idea working

[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:57.040]
You gotta try to catch the reels during any place you can and I know I can turn to you and hear it

[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:01.240]
All right, thanks five five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on it

[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:04.880]
You wouldn't remember the name of that book about Lvj it was like a strange name no

[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:06.760]
We'll figure it out

[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:09.040]
We'll put it on our website eventually

[01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:12.920]
Get a lot of names to this list. No WQ a m hello

[01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:16.360]
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, let me turn my radio down

[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.220]
I haven't talked to him and let's see all day I just got in the car

[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:24.920]
But I wondered has anybody brought up the I know you're in the kind of the conspiracy thing like I am

[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:32.500]
Why is it that Michael Jackson's house was invaded on the same day that Massachusetts brought up the gay marriage thing

[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:38.360]
Yeah, I'm sure took a that did cross my mind they were talking about that last night that if there was anything that could take

[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:44.220]
George W and all the protesters in England off the front pages of the newspapers and off the top of the newscast

[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:49.500]
This was it these two stories. Well, what I'm thinking the illicit is a lot of I think mainstream America

[01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:52.300]
Probably has never met a gay person or they don't realize they have

[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:56.180]
They associate Michael Jackson with being gay because he's a child molester

[01:40:56.700 --> 01:41:01.400]
That's right and and and they're so that's so far, you know, removed from each other. It's pathetic

[01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:07.200]
And I think that's what they did it for to bring out the Michael Jackson thing to overshadow and get

[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:12.440]
You get public opinion against the gay man. I think I think outside of the priesthood. I don't know too many gay child molesters

[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:15.100]
I think you're right there, buddy

[01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:17.740]
I'm gonna go and you two good point

[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:21.840]
5 6 7 0 5 60 yes the America, you know, and of course another

[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:25.140]
Democrats are gonna have to deal with this and everybody's ringing their hands. Well, why not?

[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:25.780]
Okay

[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:30.520]
Quit beating around the bush if you've pardoned that expression. Let's get right down to it. What do you really think?

[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:36.720]
Okay, I mean are you like really a hundred percent or you're like 50 percent? I mean, uh, you know, what kind of you will have to start?

[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:43.300]
Oh, but gee, this is the last thing we needed the audio audio and all that other bolt crap, you know

[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:48.920]
You know, it reminds me of reminds me of Bubba although Bubba sure got elected in 92 by a pretty good margin by a huge margin

[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:53.800]
Right even though he said the first thing he was gonna do was like get rid of that whole thing in a military

[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:59.440]
Right with the ban in case of military and then of course the right winger said not so fast Bubba that lasted for about three minutes

[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:02.680]
They said well not so fast. That's when we got Don't Acts don't tell

[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:06.520]
Okay, I won't

[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:10.620]
Don't ask don't tell because we're watching in the back and we'll like drag your ass out of the closet and then

[01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:12.720]
You know, embarrassing disgrace you

[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:15.800]
Now what's this stuff you send me about Bernard Goldberg

[01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:21.460]
I just was of his readers in bias now his new book. He's added again. Yeah, Bernard Bernie Goldberg's an asshole

[01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:29.600]
5 6 7 0 5 6 you let's get some names for this poll for this poll. Let's get some names on it. Okay, let's hop on it

[01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:32.160]
You think okay?

[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:34.200]
W Q a m. Hello

[01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:36.180]
Yes, sir

[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:39.620]
I got a question about this same thing marriage stuff

[01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:45.360]
Yes, you know, I've been hearing this about months and months months people talking about how

[01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:51.820]
Marriage is ordained as far back as history can find in religion for appropriation

[01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:52.920]
well

[01:42:53.880 --> 01:43:00.580]
If you put the religious argument into it and say that you can't allow things such marriages because it's against a certain religion

[01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:04.500]
The first amendment to the Constitution state the Congress shall make no law

[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:06.440]
Respecting the establishment of religion or

[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:11.920]
The what else do you expect religious nuts to say they're always going to use the religions excuse for their bigotry

[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:19.040]
Now always done it. But the thing is Congress can't create any law respecting any you know if you're gonna put religion into it

[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:24.780]
Then it's a question of what religion there are freestyles out there that think the same thing marriage is fine

[01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:28.520]
So if you're gonna put religion in that law you have to say

[01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:34.160]
Any ordained religion has the right to choose for themselves whether they're going to sanctify a thing

[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:38.840]
I think what you're gonna see is a real ugly thing now because now right off the bat as soon as Massachusetts rode yesterday

[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:42.020]
They're calling for this constitutional amendment which of course is gonna take

[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:46.620]
Two and a half years because it's got to be ratified by two-thirds of the states

[01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:52.980]
And it's gonna be really divisive and hateful and full of crap and all the usual old evil stuff and a you know be rattled back and forth again

[01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:54.100]
It's it's really sad

[01:43:54.100 --> 01:44:00.840]
Sure, what do we make us win through all that waste all our tax dollars and waste all this time to be used for right much better legislation

[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:07.920]
It's gonna go before the Supreme Court be struck down because I remember I asked me of blowjob gate all over again about all that impeachment crap

[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:11.180]
Well, the government cannot create any law that is

[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.020]
discriminatory against the person

[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:19.460]
It's easy to say that but for example an abortion which you're not doing their best to overturn roe v

[01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:21.960]
Wade and we just got this partial verse birth abortion bill

[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:27.580]
It's the same thing and of course the courts step in sometimes and then when it goes to the Supreme Court

[01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:31.540]
God only knows what they're gonna do because he's got it stuck with his right wing buddies up there which gave me a

[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:36.280]
Understand that but the whole question before the courts on abortion is not

[01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:41.420]
Completely religious. It's based on sure. Sure. Sure. Absolutely. It is

[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:46.100]
The question is based on what things are when you leave

[01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:49.920]
I mean, I'm not gay, but I just I think this whole thing is much to do about nothing

[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:54.580]
It's wasting every one's time and pissing off a lot of people. I'd rather be it's a red herring man the red hair

[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:58.920]
I'd rather see my tax dollars be wasted on something else that could actually affect people well

[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:02.620]
They're doing a good job with that too believe me anyway. You have a great thing and you too

[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:08.340]
They're doing a great job of wasting our tax dollars over a hundred billion pumping into a rack their pump in it

[01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:14.540]
People dying every day in the public is sitting back. We're like that. I'm serious man. It's just it's scary

[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:18.900]
Yeah, it's really scary how many stupid brainwashed mindless people are out there

[01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:22.700]
Just no interest in anything else outside of their own little narrow lives and that's it

[01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:27.120]
By the way on you up gay people up there you want to get married hop on a plane come on up to Toronto

[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:33.600]
Come on up to Ottawa you'll be right out here come up to London, Ontario go to Detroit and hop on the uh old

[01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:36.880]
Bridger the eternal and head over to Windsor

[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:40.140]
And tie the old knot you'll be sorry by the way

[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:45.300]
Speaking of red herrings you know one of the best out-floor to dining secrets best kept secrets is right in curl springs

[01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:50.860]
The gold co-cephaloo grilled is celebrated. They're one year anniversary. They got three and a half stars from the Sun Central Showtime Dining Review

[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:54.280]
They get ten stars from George because when they brought food in a couple weeks ago

[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:57.280]
He said it was so good. It was almost obscene. It's fantastic

[01:45:57.820 --> 01:46:03.200]
The gold co-cephaloo grilled got lots of great specialties that sound great and taste great including mango plums salmon

[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:08.220]
almond-crusted mahi mahi orange honey glazed sea bass and crab and shrimp stuffed trout

[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:12.200]
There's a great bar atmosphere at the restaurant with an extensive wine and martini list too

[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:16.060]

[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:43.420]
Okay

[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:47.600]
Yeah

[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:59.420]
And well, let me ask you something. Why do we care about that?

[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:04.300]
I mean what would be the cash all the fame for that right

[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:11.260]
Oh, that was my bed. That was the best call you right there all I can say is

[01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:16.620]
Chris be cream donuts our kosher with our tax dollars are subsidizing it

[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:21.260]
How do you like that them Dan Jews are ready to get well? I want my feet donuts got damn it

[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:29.240]
So probably worse for Duncan donuts, you know, by the way your donuts suck pal. Okay. I like crispy cream a lot

[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:33.060]
Well, that's okay. So get your coffee at the Duncan Donuts and then hop in a car

[01:49:33.060 --> 01:49:37.260]
Why do you drink it just write on down a road a few blocks and go to crispy cream and get some great donuts?

[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:41.800]
Had some Duncan Donuts coffee this morning. Duncan Donuts blows. Okay. Their coffee may be the greatest

[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:46.260]
But I don't drink coffee number one number two. I shouldn't be donuts anyway. No, you should not that was a great call

[01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:48.100]
Let's say I told you if you go through about three thousand

[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:57.100]
Sooner or later WQ I am hello. Hey, Neha. How you doing? I'm doing okay. Hey listen. I'm still just about for real

[01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:04.660]
Yeah, I love that show. I love it. It pissed off my Republican boss beyond belief which made it better

[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:06.960]
Well, what does Pearl have to do with politics?

[01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:13.840]
Nothing just well with my boss is we're going right wing bush liquor or whatever is family value

[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:18.740]
Oh, I see the family values. You's a little bit too risque too over the top for your boss. Yeah

[01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:22.380]
He I mean he got Christmas even heard me listen to it. I work and all the stuff

[01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:26.920]
I want to tell you something really bothers me and maybe I'm maybe I'm reading something wrong of this

[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:28.220]
But I I'm Thursday and Friday

[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:33.080]
Unlike some of my colleagues if I could use that term. I told exactly what happened

[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:36.800]
Whether they like their not knew the audience with most of our listeners who unhappy with what happened

[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:41.200]
And I told it exactly the way it was and there are a lot of people didn't want to hear exactly the way it was

[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:44.420]
They wanted to hear me go on and say oh our management's out of their mind

[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:46.560]
The blah blah blah blah and just rip grid read again

[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:49.140]
Well, I did rip him for what he deserved and that was hiring a guy

[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:53.060]
Which he knew what he does in the first place and then firing him for doing what he knew he should have done

[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:56.480]
You see what I'm saying? I'm sure Greg deserves to be ripped for that

[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:01.360]
But in this other case when somebody tells you you know the real world when somebody says hey

[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:04.320]
We're taking a lot of heat because of you like last year it was me

[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:08.800]
How was the one it was my turn with that kind of ease of business and they tell you look you can't do this again

[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:12.220]
Or you're gonna lose your job. We're gonna fire your ass unless you're on moron

[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:16.460]
Let's have some kind of a death wish you say okay. I don't need to do that. See what I'm saying

[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:18.420]
Yeah, stupid with an awesome show

[01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:21.080]
Right exactly that that's right

[01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:26.240]
It was an awesome show with but the problem was you dealing with a guy who just has a death wish

[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.660]
What if he like went way in with like

[01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:32.380]
Such someone to call him fast down with that help now

[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:35.380]
Well the word the word is out of control

[01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:37.200]
Well, he's not coming back not on this station

[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:40.080]
So he didn't buy city and let me say it again

[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:43.620]
He he was not going to be fired. He was going to be suspended

[01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:48.080]
And when the two guys when clearance and dub called him up on that Wednesday a week ago

[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:52.700]
And the guys who've been supporting him and saving his job for a couple of months because he keeps going over the edge

[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:55.920]
And they call him up to try to tell me he's going to be suspended for two days

[01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:58.880]
And you can stick it up your hand up about you miserable

[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:02.920]
Faggot about all this other crap. Well, you think you're guys going to keep his job doing that

[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:09.920]
I just got just voted my arbitrarity got diarrhea to him and you him and you and how I think my vote doesn't count

[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:11.500]
What do you need to help?

[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:20.000]
Well, it helps you yeah, it's gonna help great get a higher revenue for that time spot because I'll have a higher reading right

[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.020]
You know my guy's gone well

[01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:25.680]
I'll I'll continue as we enjoyed working with him

[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:28.500]
He was a lot of fun. He was a hoody was getting big numbers in there

[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:29.820]
Which obviously shows in October

[01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:33.360]
But you have to have a certain sense of survival. You know what I mean in this world

[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:37.520]
You just can't go off and do whatever hell you want and like eight in between eight and ten

[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:39.140]
I don't want to hear sports. I want to laugh

[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:41.480]
Hey, well, what can I tell you?

[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:47.040]
I think he has tolly we love you. Thanks a lot. All right. Go ahead and get married. Okay. I'm gonna do it

[01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:48.320]
This week

[01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:52.720]
Anybody out there in the street. Hey, come on up. You look pretty good. Let's get married

[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.600]
I mean the for a week at you know dwell on that

[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:58.780]
I mean what I just said I have the feeling that there were a lot of people

[01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:03.200]
A enormous numbers of guys out there who are really unhappy with what I said. There's the infride you know something

[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:05.700]
I'd say it again because that's just exactly what happened

[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:12.100]
And for me to like go and the defendant defend and defend you know what reminds me of back in the Randy road days

[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:15.260]
Yeah, here's another person if you defended her

[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:19.760]
95% of the 98% of the time, but if there's two percent of the time you said what no

[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:23.120]
I think she was wrong about this or or whatever it was oh my god

[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:27.120]
I thought you were my friend that who uh all I remember those days sure do

[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:31.960]
Nobody supported her more than I did at iod and yet I still wasn't good enough

[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:38.260]
Because if you don't support me 100% 100% of the time then you're a piece of crap and you're a backstabbing phony

[01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:39.080]
Well, that's full crap

[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:42.200]
And we had a good thing going here

[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:47.160]
But I I was aware of all the stuff that was going on behind the scenes and how long can it go on and I told here's

[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:49.580]
I'm the one guy. This is what really frost my ass

[01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:54.040]
The one guy in this market who's got the balls and to talk about jack Thompson by name on friday

[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:56.840]
Which I have no compulsion with doing because there's nothing to prevent me from doing it

[01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:01.160]
Why should anybody who's pulling all this crap behind the scenes can get some kind of an exemption?

[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:02.080]
I don't know

[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:05.800]
He's a public figure for years and years now. He's been pulling this kind of a crap

[01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:12.180]
And I told it exactly the way it was and when somebody is on your ass and on the stations acid on your license

[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:15.380]
There are things that you have to do to survive because if we don't have any license

[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:19.860]
There is no Scott for well showing there ain't no neo-rodger show there ain't no no show okay. They're ain't nothing

[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:23.760]
It's a matter of staying in business. It's it's not rocket science

[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:29.640]
And if you're that much filled with you filled up with yourself and that got that kind of kind of gigantic ego

[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:32.040]
Then there's a problem there and a problem there

[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:35.240]
Obviously is following this guy from one place to another because he gets canned everywhere

[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:40.300]
He goes because he cannot stop he cannot stop going way over the line and like I said last week

[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:41.640]
He doesn't need to do that

[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:48.000]
He's off the wall. He's entertaining. He's funny. He's unique. He's all of these things. He doesn't need to go there

[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.240]
But he can't stop

[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:52.940]
And to me it's kind of like childish, you know

[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:56.000]
It would have been like if I came on here the next day after meeting like a year ago

[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.240]
November when a year ago now and would have started playing the unexpergated condolese in the next day

[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:03.840]
I mean it has to be a crazy person

[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:05.760]
What would be the point

[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:08.200]
Yeah exactly

[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:12.740]
George you're fired. Yeah, I've heard that before. Yeah, I know

[01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:14.680]
That's what the most said right?

[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:22.040]
Yeah, nice going most so far. Yank had anybody fired you just a just a waste of time and Joe Rose says stay down out of his studio

[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:26.700]
Yeah, he does and now he died now. I see people think I'm making them that up your witness

[01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:30.740]
Joe doesn't want anything to do with it. He made it very very clear crystal clear

[01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:34.160]
Okay, Mo stay down out of there. He doesn't want to conserve with you. He don't want nothing to do with you

[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.300]
It can't stand your ass

[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:40.620]
So don't come in there pretend to suck around now after after in fact he went so far Mo

[01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:45.340]
Well, Neil. I now I realized I shouldn't own sooner was all Joe stick Joe roses the real ass hole around here

[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:50.460]
Yeah, he goes from one to the other trying to deflect because of the fact that everybody hates him

[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:54.360]
You know, so trying to like suck up to me that didn't work either Mo you're still a piece of crap

[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:59.220]
The most I'm sure is the most unacceptable human being I've ever met in my life in her outer radio

[01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:02.820]
I just never encountered anybody so full of himself and full of crap

[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:07.180]
In addition to what you show a soda and boring man. It's just ponderous

[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:08.800]
Unbelievable Mo

[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:14.840]
Anyway, let's see Rudy says it was great listening about Bill or Riley, but one person is more obnoxious is Sean Hannity

[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:18.500]

[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:29.480]

[01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:31.180]

[01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:43.580]

[01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:46.600]
Which I'm sure it's not that great since they can't control their lives

[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:51.280]
They want to control ours if guys want to marry each other and it's supposed to go to hell then that's their problem right

[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:54.300]
Maybe they want to flame in hell if they're flaming

[01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:58.120]
They're not taking me with them for what they do. I live my life the way I want net freedom

[01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:11.900]

Every good Christian knows a game

[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:40.700]
To play

[01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:43.840]
If it's not so very hard to do

[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:47.400]
The name of the game is the Bible

[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:52.320]
I said if you were to put it to where we do tell people you know the way

[01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:56.580]
Invite them to your house

[01:58:57.620 --> 01:58:59.720]
They're possessions away

[01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:03.260]
And then you burn it down

[01:59:06.060 --> 01:59:08.880]
You can get somebody to believe that

[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:12.160]
You make the Bible say it's true

[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:15.740]
You can be

[01:59:15.740 --> 01:59:20.680]
Will always work if you pick up the poison is

[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:26.560]
Oh my god

[01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:47.980]
She

[01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:49.700]
Speech to crop out of her kids

[01:59:50.180 --> 01:59:50.620]
Yeah

[02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:13.580]
And only nine days away from another big anniversary speaking of a rinse and a cool aid

[02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:17.620]
Jim Jones, and I know they tried it out. Some of these survivors from Jones, don't you see that?

[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:21.480]
Yeah. I mean, why are we commemorating that? Is there any special reason?

[02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:26.520]
Well, we should remember it if not commemorate. Why is that? Because it was a bad thing. And this

[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:31.600]
is what can happen to you if you believe a preacher. Oh, in other words, if you believe a cult like any of the other religions.

[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:37.560]
I know. I can't say it's always a bad thing to me. And I got sucked in years ago back in those boring days when I used to do shows with guests on KAT

[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:43.400]
and WS News. And wow, we have to deprogram kids from these cults because they get brainwashed. And they take away their

[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:49.820]
ability to think. And I remember asking in those days, because I used to like argue with all the priest and the rabbi's and all the mother goyum.

[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:59.720]
You know, well, what's the difference? What constitutes a cult? And the answers were just shocking, mind-boggling. Well, you know, something with a strong,

[02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:10.820]
you know, like a father figure. And I'd say you mean like the Pope? Oh, yeah, like that. Oh, no. And taking people's ability to reason for themselves away from them.

[02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:16.120]
Oh, you mean like all the other means they so-called Judeo Christian and all the other Muslims. Of course, all of these things.

[02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:25.080]
Every religion is a cult. Okay, it's just that some do a better job of it. And some are more accepted by the guy, their mainstream media, who I don't have the balls to take them on. That's the problem.

[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:36.640]
So all of this business about gay people and gay marriages and the straight people and slavery and all this other crap. And women are like, see, when you're looking all the religions of the world and see the way that women are treated,

[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:42.480]
how dare the so-called Western religionists point their finger at the Muslims and talk about the way that they treat women.

[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:48.620]
Huh? Right. It's all the same crap. It's all the same. Cravitch is a different way of doing it. That's all.

[02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:56.800]
The Judeo Christian tradition has a long rich history of subjugating women and making them 10th class citizens. All those Middle Eastern religions. All the same. Right.

[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:04.760]
All of them lunatics. Crazy people. And if you don't believe me, take just take a look at the news. Just take a glance at your pants.

[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:16.300]
Airbeade, they're busy. Get on each other. Well, here's another illegal settlement over here. And because we think that one of the terrorists might live in this block, let's just blow some houses up. And maybe some of his relatives will die too. And that'll teach them a lesson.

[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:25.980]
At least they won't be doing no suicide on them. Yeah. And of course we're doing the same thing now in Iraq. There's a good story on our website. There's a lot of good stories on our website. Nobody's going to it anymore. That's okay. They're busy.

[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:48.040]
But there's a great story about that about how we're doing the same thing in Iraq now as part of our desperation to try to find a way out. Just wholesale laying waste. Yeah, laying waste. Well, so in other words, if a bunch of houses are turned to rubble and are happened to be some innocent bystanders, some panoramas innocent bystanders, and some bunch of kids in there. Well, that's just the way it goes. It's more collateral damage. And we don't count them anyway.

[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:51.600]
We make sure that there's nobody in those groves that we're cluster bombing right now. Right.

[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:57.520]
This in this cute. I want my daughter to grow up to be just like Richard Simmons.

[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:04.580]
Oh, okay. Oh, man. Maybe a little bit more macho than that.

[02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:08.880]
He's a real asshole. By the way, if I mention that in a long time, I know what I've heard.

[02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:19.940]
5.6.7. Oh, look at this. Look at this. Oh, man. This is really something. This is more. Huh? There's more coming. Yeah.

[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:22.460]
Okay. This is from a Google search.

[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:31.060]
Coral Gables attorney, Jack Thompson is filed a letter complaint objecting the renewal of clear channel's license for classic rock station WBGG.

[02:03:31.060 --> 02:03:36.700]
9 before lottery, big 106 on the basis of the station's carriage of Howard Stern's syndicated morning show.

[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:44.240]
So you see, it isn't just Scott for well. It isn't just this station. It's any station that wacky Jack, he doesn't approve of.

[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:51.700]
He's appointed himself as the moral censor of what you people out there can hear on a radio and watch on TV and see on video games.

[02:03:51.700 --> 02:04:01.040]
Any other damn thing. Thompson provided notay tapes or transcripts with the complaint, but asserts that the FCC cannot disregard this informal objection on the basis of some of the rules.

[02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:10.540]
It's a legislative to provide transcripts or audio recordings as these have been provided the FCC by the undersigned and supportive past formal decency complaints about the Howard Stern show only to be ignored totally by the FCC.

[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:18.720]
This in itself is an abrogation of legal duties of the FCC. Don't you like the tone of that? Yeah. How do you do this? Yaudi, yaudi, yaudi.

[02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:25.280]
And what I thought there's more of this. There's another page coming. It's coming.

[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:38.480]
So it's I hear it clicking back there already. So there you go. That's it. I think it's time that you people should go behind the scenes rather than all this going on quietly, which is why it's a damn good thing that I exposed the momyster a long time ago like last year for all a crap.

[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:43.560]
He was trying to pull or getting George fired interfering with this show. Stirring to pot the try to like interfere with everybody.

[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:51.480]
He can't whether it was everybody on that show the beast and what calls her name Carolyn Carolyn.

[02:04:53.180 --> 02:05:06.740]
See out of sight out of mind. Well, this is just a little bit more on this. More on. More on. Oh, look at this. This is a letter from this is a response from the FCC attorneys, I guess.

[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:19.020]
Concerns the captioned application for the renewal of license of big for Lauderdale followed by clear channel for the reasons set forth below the informal objections are denied and the application is granted.

[02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:31.580]
How do you like that? The informal objections led to the biggest broadcast in decent programming and violation of 18 yaudi, including the Howard Stern show and the near Roger show and argue that such broadcast.

[02:05:31.580 --> 02:05:41.400]
Now, how do you like that? The near Roger show is non big radio WBGG and argue that this broadcast warranted an aisle of bigs or license free new application.

[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:48.260]
I sure hope that wacky Jackie didn't mention my name in regard to his complaints because the near Rogers is not supposed to be mentioned by a self-same.

[02:05:48.680 --> 02:05:54.020]
For you to agree with the he signed or revoluntarily ten years ago or more than that.

[02:05:56.280 --> 02:06:05.380]
However, because none of the objections included audio tapes or broadcast transcripts, the commission cannot determine whether they provide a basis for further inquiry or denial of the renewal application further examination.

[02:06:05.380 --> 02:06:19.040]
The renewal application reveals that a grant they're able to further the public interest can be in necessity in light of the above and pursuant the audio to the informal objections are denied and application to renew the license of big FM for Lauderdale are granted.

[02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:25.640]
Why, everybody good at the FCC didn't even have that got WBFF instead of BGG and this one per gram.

[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:35.580]
If that's interesting, including the Howard Stern show and the near Roger show, the near Roger show is non big 106. What the hell did my name get involved in that again? Jack?

[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:40.200]
There we go. I'm saving that. Look at the US sincerely.

[02:06:41.720 --> 02:06:45.220]
Since early what? Linda Blair?

[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:51.820]
Holy cow, the name of the broad that wrote this response was Linda Blair.

[02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:54.600]
That's the power of Christ who pays you.

[02:06:54.700 --> 02:06:57.900]
The power of Christ who pays you.

[02:06:58.600 --> 02:07:06.480]
Audio services division. Mass media bureau. Linda Blair. How do you like that? She's a real head turner. I'll say to that.

[02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:11.600]
I'm saving that and pass that along to the proper authorities. I'll tell that right now.

[02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:17.420]
Get my name involved on a station. I don't even work for them. Which my program may even heard. I wish it was though because it's FM with a big signal.

[02:07:18.580 --> 02:07:23.640]
There's a fact. What? Wouldn't that be nice? Yeah, it wouldn't be. Wouldn't that be nice? That's what Brian Wilson said. Look what happened to him.

[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:29.540]
Here's the fact it says the suction from always just pathetic and desperate as he tries feverishly to backtrack and back pedal.

[02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:34.700]
Now Neil is okay and Joe roses a buddy. You won't work. We all hate you. Mo everybody. We hate you.

[02:07:34.860 --> 02:07:46.880]
I was going to be the benefit of the doubt says the facts are but listen. You're gloating and backstabbing last week after your friend Scott was canned showed everybody your two covers as a nasty talentless bitter old piece of crap. Very well said. That's the best facts we've had all year.

Hello. How much?

[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:31.200]
He said the administration looking for a leader in Iraq who can control the religious fanatics and control the ethnic from killing each other.

[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:33.880]
Who is going to control the religious fanatics in the USA?

[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:43.100]
I am saying that what she said and have respect of the people and a very recognizable name.

[02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:47.260]
You know, I just think of it. Before we were in that, they had a guy like that.

[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:48.060]
Yeah, right.

[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:13.500]
Hey, who's going to muscle?

[02:13:13.620 --> 02:13:17.720]
He was a brutal dictator, but in the meantime, they had like a law and order and the...

[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:18.040]
If he had a child and he could have...

[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:21.760]
Did you hear the new West?

[02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:23.940]
They cannot produce gasoline.

[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:31.840]
So, Hollywood and vice-gazolin from one of its subsidies in Kuwait for $2.57.

[02:13:32.180 --> 02:13:34.160]
And then they sell it at a huge level for $25.

[02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:38.480]
And $2.25 a gallon, the American taxpayers pay for it.

[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:39.800]
That's really nice.

[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:41.800]
That's...

[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:43.180]
We're in a wrong business man.

[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:43.640]
We're in a wrong business man.

[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:44.560]
Oh, yes. That's right.

[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:47.520]
That's right. The Hollywood and the United States made that like bandage.

[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:55.080]
And all the, you know, the weapons, you know, a bunker-busting bomb cost $18 million.

[02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:58.260]
A lid out of defective cannon barrels.

[02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:02.740]
Hey, if I were making cannon barrels and I would have to...

[02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:09.080]
I screwed one up and I would have to sell it to a junkman for $500 or the taxpayers for $18 million.

[02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:11.660]
Hey, I would sell it to the taxpayer for $18 million.

[02:14:11.980 --> 02:14:12.800]
There you go. Why not?

[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:15.060]
Just as much fun as a price.

[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:17.220]
Thanks a lot, Kelly. That's what you have when you get another...

[02:14:17.220 --> 02:14:18.480]
Another dick in the White House?

[02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:20.460]
Couldn't have said it better myself, Terry.

[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:22.340]
We miss Terry Griffin. She's a sweetheart.

[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:23.240]
Yes, she is.

[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:26.120]
We worked with a lot of nice people over the years, and then we worked with some assholes too.

[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:29.840]
You know, this fact you sent me, this is a great idea for a pull which we've never done.

[02:14:30.060 --> 02:14:31.180]
I didn't, I don't think we have.

[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:32.240]
This is good.

[02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:35.220]
Because they sure don't like today's pull, but yeah, I'm going to show you something.

[02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:36.140]
In fact, I'll bet...

[02:14:36.140 --> 02:14:37.080]
No, I don't want to see it.

[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:39.440]
No, listen. I bet Mo's life on it.

[02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:39.900]
Okay.

[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:43.060]
Tomorrow for part of the show, you know, a lot of these we do two pulls.

[02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:45.080]
I mean, why not do two pulls? It's more fun than doing just one.

[02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:47.360]
But that's what I always say.

[02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:53.060]
Where if we do the same pull with your son, who'd you, you know, who'd your son like the old model?

[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:54.160]
Do you understand?

[02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:56.140]
I guarantee there'd be a Zidane Morvots.

[02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:57.760]
You'll see. You'll write a lot more names on it.

[02:14:58.620 --> 02:15:00.720]
It's part of that same thing I was talking to a little while ago.

[02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:01.480]
Who the hell is my husband?

[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:04.320]
I mean, people, you know, want to do something with him.

[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:06.280]
They want to do him. They want to use him and abuse him.

[02:15:06.580 --> 02:15:07.480]
It'd be better than that.

[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:09.100]
It's more compatible women out there.

[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:09.700]
Right.

[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.600]
And anyway, maybe I'm wrong about that.

[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:14.000]
Maybe there won't be any names on it either.

[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:14.900]
Maybe it's just a bad idea.

[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:15.540]
But I don't think so.

[02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:16.320]
I thought it was kind of cute.

[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:18.000]
But this thing is good.

[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:24.460]
The American Phil Institute hums the top 100 movie songs, which is just a cute headline.

[02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:29.800]
Anyway, they're going to honor the songs of Hollywood and it's ongoing celebration of American movies with AFIs,

[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:31.000]
100 years, 100 songs.

[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:32.740]
America's greatest music in the movie.

[02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:34.520]
The three hour speciality broadcast next year.

[02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:36.060]
And we never done nothing like that.

[02:15:36.180 --> 02:15:37.620]
So I'm putting it in my TV thing.

[02:15:37.820 --> 02:15:38.340]
It's been not like that.

[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:40.900]
I'm putting it in my pool pile.

[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:44.900]
I have an old pile of pools over here and I'm sticking it right on top.

[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:45.520]
That's a good idea.

[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:49.980]
Maybe we can get some more names on this pool today before we close this sucker out.

[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:50.740]
Because it's not good.

[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:52.840]
Here's Orlando. Hello.

[02:15:53.380 --> 02:15:53.720]
Hi, Neil.

[02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:54.480]
Yes, sir.

[02:15:54.700 --> 02:15:55.420]
How's it going today?

[02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:56.360]
Pretty damn good.

[02:15:56.900 --> 02:15:57.400]
That's good.

[02:15:57.740 --> 02:16:00.860]
Hey, the last couple of days you've been reading Al Franken's book.

[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:03.040]
Two days ago it was Ann Coulter.

[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:03.780]
Yes, it was.

[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:04.920]
You, Riley.

[02:16:05.300 --> 02:16:05.460]
Right.

[02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:12.300]
Man, you're reading his, he said next chapter about the O'Reilly yesterday.

[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:14.820]
He said, we'll get the Sean Hannity later.

[02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:16.580]
Next chapter.

[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:18.220]
I would love to hear that.

[02:16:18.460 --> 02:16:20.040]
I don't think you have time today to read it.

[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:20.900]
How about Tamara?

[02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:21.580]
How does that sound?

[02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:22.520]
Tamara sounds good to me.

[02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:23.580]
That's what man.

[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:24.240]
He's an asshole.

[02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:25.580]
Okay.

[02:16:26.060 --> 02:16:26.520]
Thank you.

[02:16:26.860 --> 02:16:27.160]
Thank you.

[02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:28.760]
Mother so many assholes and so little time.

[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:30.980]
He's talking about Sean Hannity by the way, not Al Franken.

[02:16:31.620 --> 02:16:34.720]
You know what I didn't get one call or one facts from anybody who said,

[02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:36.460]
oh, don't read that stuff on here.

[02:16:36.660 --> 02:16:40.280]
And of course, I know if we take the polls, it's a different story because a lot of people like to pile on our poll.

[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:41.860]
Yeah, and load it up.

[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:43.120]
Hannity.

[02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:49.220]
In fact, the heading of chapter 14 in Franken's book, it says Hannity and then it's much smaller letters and combs.

[02:16:50.060 --> 02:16:51.480]
This guy is a panic.

[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:57.020]
He's right on target and he can take the most depressing grotesque stuff and give you a little chuckle to his grade.

[02:16:58.400 --> 02:16:59.200]
I'll say it again.

[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:03.620]
Michael Moore and Al Franken, president and vice president, and they can like alternate.

[02:17:03.620 --> 02:17:04.200]
You know what I mean?

[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:06.720]
Like for six months a piece, then we'll like switch positions.

[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:07.820]
That's a balanced ticket.

[02:17:07.940 --> 02:17:08.940]
I shouldn't say switch position.

[02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:11.820]
Sixth and four say Hillary.

[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:14.400]
They'd like their daughter to be just like Hillary, frigid.

[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:19.100]
Twenty five, Joyce, a Jocelyn Elders, Susan, Surrend, and twenty four.

[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:20.980]
I'm telling you who I loved all of she's dead.

[02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:24.440]
And then people are going to say, you know, the usual homophobes and right wingers will say,

[02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:25.800]
oh, that's because she was a dyke.

[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:27.220]
It turned out was Barbara Jordan, man.

[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:27.840]
I loved her.

[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:29.660]
She was brilliant.

[02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:30.380]
She was articulate.

[02:17:30.460 --> 02:17:31.460]
She had balls.

[02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:32.240]
Well, she was.

[02:17:32.420 --> 02:17:33.540]
But I mean, she was great.

[02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:34.340]
Remember Barbara Jordan?

[02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:35.060]
No.

[02:17:36.020 --> 02:17:37.500]
The Congresswoman from Texas?

[02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:37.940]
No.

[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:41.380]
I wasn't into politics, uh, whenever that was.

[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:42.520]
It's not that long ago.

[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:43.860]
You have to be schmitting me.

[02:17:43.940 --> 02:17:45.220]
You know who Barbara Jordan was.

[02:17:45.380 --> 02:17:45.620]
Barbara Jordan was black.

[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:46.400]
Right.

[02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:51.480]
Big, heavy, real outspoken, liberal, great, no take, no crap from anybody.

[02:17:51.780 --> 02:17:52.900]
Barbara Jordan was great.

[02:17:54.140 --> 02:17:55.700]
I can't believe it.

[02:17:55.880 --> 02:17:56.860]
I've heard the name and stuff.

[02:17:57.020 --> 02:17:57.740]
I just never heard of the chairs.

[02:17:57.740 --> 02:17:58.460]
I was sitting in the other chair.

[02:17:58.620 --> 02:17:59.480]
You can't sit over there.

[02:17:59.500 --> 02:18:00.040]
You can't sit over there.

[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:00.040]

[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:00.040]

[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:00.040]

[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:00.040]

[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:00.040]

[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:00.040]

[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:00.120]
Get me.

[02:18:00.260 --> 02:18:00.360]
I'm a little goat.

[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:00.360]

[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:00.360]

[02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:02.220]
I shouldn't know because you put clothes on hole.

[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:03.280]
I didn't have to, but that's good.

[02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:06.240]
But, uh, now Miguel's heard of Barbara Jordan.

[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:08.820]
Right.

[02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:09.420]
Not.

[02:18:10.100 --> 02:18:11.980]
I'm working with a couple of banana boat people.

[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:12.880]
I can't believe this.

[02:18:12.980 --> 02:18:14.500]
I bet you if Tommy was still and he wouldn't hurt him.

[02:18:14.580 --> 02:18:15.240]
He's the end of drugs.

[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:18.200]
I'm sorry for, I mean you've got to be kidding me.

[02:18:18.700 --> 02:18:19.400]
I've heard the name.

[02:18:19.420 --> 02:18:20.760]
I just never sat through one of her speeches.

[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:21.920]
I didn't watch C-SPAN.

[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:26.240]
Oh my god, you don't have to watch a C-spander who Barbara Jordan was

[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:30.020]
Boy that just it just leaves me limp

[02:18:30.820 --> 02:18:37.420]
My whole political interest is relatively recent. Oh here speaking of a stone. We got somebody in Miami. It's his stone. Hello

[02:18:37.420 --> 02:18:40.480]
Yeah, yes, sir. How you doing? Are you stone?

[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:43.860]
Yes, don't I go excellent?

[02:18:43.860 --> 02:18:49.160]
Well when I heard you read they got Jake Thompson name I could stand Jake Thompson's that Thompson

[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:54.940]
If this is the same jerk who is a chronic writer to the land here

[02:18:55.860 --> 02:18:59.480]
At a real page right he is a jerk

[02:19:00.220 --> 02:19:03.700]
I mean these guys think I think you're being very kind

[02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:05.220]
Okay

[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:07.280]
Anyway

[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:14.780]
They're telling that we'll be fine. Oh exactly. Oh, we're fine very well

[02:19:14.780 --> 02:19:19.080]
So and you'll listen to what you like listening to and he ain't got enough of us about it and have a great thing

[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:23.440]
Yeah, it's very simple Jack if people have listened to this show or Howard Stern or whatever

[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:27.780]
They'll listen to it and we still have for real if it weren't for you. I want the audience to know that very clearly

[02:19:27.780 --> 02:19:28.120]
Okay

[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.300]
Because there were no other outside agitators

[02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:35.320]
There was nobody else trying to get the guy came and that's the whole reason that he was taking all that heat and taking all that

[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:39.620]
Flack and crap and of course you'll notice nobody writes about that because everybody in the newspaper including jick and all

[02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:43.120]
Yeah, there's not understand. They're also intimidated. They're terrified to put the guys name in the newspaper

[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:48.260]
Less heat come after them again, plus they don't have the agreement like we got against him with me

[02:19:48.260 --> 02:19:52.140]
Which he can't touch me and by the way, I sure hope they didn't mention my name in that big one

[02:19:52.140 --> 02:19:55.060]
Oh six because he might have to pack a toothbrush and some other

[02:19:55.060 --> 02:19:56.880]
Cootraments very soon if he did

[02:19:57.660 --> 02:20:02.200]
Talk about in clear violation, but then again, it's the kind of hanky-panky you expect happens behind the scenes

[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:04.060]

Peace a sense of well-being a sense of self-worth

It comes from the inside out. It doesn't come from the outside in

[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:29.800]
Suke

[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:31.460]
Is there at all

[02:21:31.460 --> 02:21:32.940]
Text is matter

He's a misdi noticing no et al

[02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:46.880]
Never one should see

[02:21:47.880 --> 02:21:48.840]
Crazy

[02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:51.220]
That's crazy.

[02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:53.100]
Dr. Phil, why?

[02:21:55.300 --> 02:21:57.560]
Do your eyes do that?

[02:21:57.900 --> 02:21:59.420]
Dr. Phil, try.

[02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:04.480]
Do some of your own fans.

[02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:18.820]
What makes you think that you do have the right to judge him for gain a few penalty

[02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:39.020]
of your money?

[02:22:39.340 --> 02:22:42.000]
What's the point?

[02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:42.860]
What's the point?

[02:22:42.860 --> 02:22:42.880]
What's the point?

[02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:42.880]

[02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:42.880]

[02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:42.880]

[02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:42.880]

[02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:44.180]

[02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:44.560]

[02:22:46.300 --> 02:22:47.080]
What's the point?

[02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:47.760]
What's the point?

[02:22:47.780 --> 02:22:47.780]

[02:22:47.900 --> 02:22:48.660]
What's the point?

[02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:52.820]
You're not up, just leave and take your son in case

[02:23:02.220 --> 02:23:04.540]
You decide and watch the TV

[02:23:04.540 --> 02:23:06.440]
Put the finger up their butt

[02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:08.200]

[02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:11.380]
White bump to know what Christians do for fun

[02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:13.360]
Venus being violent in the corners

[02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:15.460]
Whilearming their nuts

[02:23:15.460 --> 02:23:18.280]
Whoa, white love to know, white love to know

[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:20.060]
When Christians do perform

[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:23.600]
Posting white and tasty from the faculty

[02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:29.560]
It's hailing back to macaroni and cheese

[02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:33.540]
Gun holes in the digi, just in case they reproduce

[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:38.080]
That's just about all they're allowed to do

[02:23:41.740 --> 02:23:44.020]
White love to know, white love to know

[02:23:44.020 --> 02:23:48.580]
White love to know, white love to know

[02:23:48.580 --> 02:23:50.080]
White love to know, white love to know

[02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:59.120]
Do they get it swollen, putt, while feeding out their guns

[02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:01.900]
Whoa, white love to know, white love to know

[02:24:01.900 --> 02:24:03.720]
When Christians do perform

[02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:06.020]
Do they polish up the fish

[02:24:06.020 --> 02:24:08.040]
I'm tailgating of their truck

[02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:10.920]
Whoa, white love to know, white love to know

[02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:12.700]
When Christians do perform

[02:24:12.700 --> 02:24:17.700]
See that standing heat and sit back down, I can't get you

[02:24:17.700 --> 02:24:21.680]
And my shirt all down with a twelter like a fru

[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:26.240]
Live a life of boredom up to heaven, you go

[02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:31.180]
I'd only smile the bun, pouring at home

[02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:36.720]
Whoa, white love to know, white love to know

[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:38.680]
White love to know, white love to know

[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:41.140]
Yeah, I'd love to know, white love to know

[02:24:41.140 --> 02:24:42.420]
White love to know

[02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:54.000]
All right, back to my next video

[02:24:55.020 --> 02:24:56.880]
New this fall on Fox

[02:24:56.880 --> 02:25:01.000]
It's a late night talk show unlike any other you've ever seen

[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:05.000]
Thicking a pop snuggles into his king-size bed with war milk and cookies

[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:08.260]
And interview some of Hollywood's hottest young celebrities

[02:25:08.260 --> 02:25:09.860]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey no

[02:25:09.860 --> 02:25:19.280]
This is Michael Jackson in bed with an Oscar nominee who was currently starring as the voice of Movy and Disney's New Animated Adventure, the younger book 2

[02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:24.320]
Please welcome my special guest in my bed, Hayley Jordan Azman

[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:26.480]
Oh, do we have to do this in your bag?

[02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:28.940]
It's innocent. It's very charming

[02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:31.660]
I let my children sleep with very good.

[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:34.620]
Oh, so tell me, Harry, Joe, Osmond.

[02:25:34.940 --> 02:25:37.480]
How was it working with lovable bear balloon?

[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:41.200]
He's not real, Michael. He's a cartoon voice by John Goodman.

[02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:43.700]
Hey, look what I could do with this.

[02:25:45.260 --> 02:25:48.280]
You never know who's going to be sleeping in Michael's bed.

[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:52.560]
I'm here with my next guest, Snuggler Love in my bed.

[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:54.620]
It's a big TV star.

[02:25:54.620 --> 02:25:58.520]
The child will play simple, which is son and n.y. p.d. blue.

[02:25:58.740 --> 02:26:02.320]
Hello, child, will play simple, which is son and n.y. p.d. blue.

[02:26:02.380 --> 02:26:03.520]
Bye, my heart.

[02:26:03.940 --> 02:26:05.360]
Would you like to play a game?

[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:08.040]
Child will play simple, which is son and n.y. p.d. blue?

[02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:08.680]
Sure.

[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.480]
Put put on this mask.

[02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:11.720]
I'm here with you.

[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:16.300]
Having so much fun, me and my children play this game with very good all the time.

[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:18.080]
Put the mask on.

[02:26:18.140 --> 02:26:19.180]
I'm here with you.

[02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:21.160]
Touch this one time.

[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:29.280]
So grab some more milk and cookies and join Waco Jacko for some late night TV like you've

[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:30.540]
never seen before.

[02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:32.120]
It's sleeping with Michael Jackson.

[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:34.080]
We can't eat son-falks.

[02:26:34.820 --> 02:26:38.300]
Down there, get down there, you're moving wild.

[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:45.300]
I dropped in on the floor.

[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:48.340]
I was turning blue.

[02:26:48.540 --> 02:26:49.800]
I'm bad right after you.

[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:54.600]
I never thought that I would die at the same time that Johnny has to do.

[02:26:56.060 --> 02:26:57.480]
Shuffee, ambulance door.

[02:26:57.880 --> 02:26:58.900]
Shuffee, ambulance door.

[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:00.600]
Where's nothing else you can do?

[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:07.020]
Johnny and I are three food of pickups that come in and pass away with the boy named Spoon.

[02:27:08.340 --> 02:27:13.200]
I think I may have thought something when I think to pass on with that day.

[02:27:14.580 --> 02:27:16.640]
I always thought you were a fool.

[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:19.400]
Well, every show I could believe.

[02:27:20.780 --> 02:27:25.360]
Oh, there was Italy, it's all from the alcohol and in the cocaine.

[02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:28.360]
I was a star of the two.

[02:27:29.660 --> 02:27:31.420]
And that was both of the two.

[02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:34.540]
So ladies and gentlemen,

[02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:36.120]
I'll break it down now.

[02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:38.360]
Have you been introduced to?

[02:27:38.780 --> 02:27:41.420]
Tell me something called the RIA.

[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:42.500]
Break it down.

[02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:46.980]
I knew one Saturday it would all come down on me.

[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:52.080]
Although there's been three years and I got off the whip for breath.

[02:27:52.220 --> 02:27:56.660]
So I'm saved goodbye to those songs I've promised.

[02:27:57.100 --> 02:27:59.500]
So they said three songs on a loud.

[02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:01.440]
So I'm paying for them now.

[02:28:01.700 --> 02:28:02.440]
Mama, listen.

[02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:06.500]
Senior reader, RIA, soon lost.

[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:09.200]
Now the fun is over.

[02:28:09.740 --> 02:28:12.560]
And now we are soon no more free soul.

[02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:16.140]
Sharing our music isn't too many hard.

[02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:17.420]
It ain't heard no one.

[02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:19.560]
Now everything you discover,

[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:21.620]
All complaints and everything.

[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:25.560]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:32.660]
When summer rolls around,

[02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:35.660]
there's nothing I like more than sitting on the front porch

[02:28:35.660 --> 02:28:38.800]
with a nice cold glass of country moment lemonade.

[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:45.500]
The only thing they could make it better would be a pretty little girl sitting next to me.

[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:46.800]
Now I'll wait a second.

[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:48.380]
A pretty little naked girl.

[02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:49.700]
Yeah, that's what I meant.

[02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:50.700]
No, no, wait.

[02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:55.600]
A pretty little naked girl who puts a hand on my thigh and starts rubbing real gentle like it.

[02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:56.780]
No, no, no, I got it.

[02:28:57.060 --> 02:29:00.340]
A pretty little naked girl rubbing my thigh, talking dirty in my air,

[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:02.420]
throwing me on the porch and has her way with me.

[02:29:02.540 --> 02:29:03.380]
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

[02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:06.340]
She just starts pounding me man, riding the hog screaming,

[02:29:06.340 --> 02:29:07.740]
do me baby, do me.

[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:08.920]
Give it to mama.

[02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:11.660]
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:29:11.660 --> 02:29:14.320]
Oh, forget the damn lemonade man, just give me a naked girl.

[02:29:14.460 --> 02:29:15.820]
Come on, I need for a ride.

[02:29:17.860 --> 02:29:19.500]
He's a super star.

[02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:20.120]
He's a super star.

[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:20.120]

[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:20.120]

[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:20.120]

[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:20.300]
He's a super star.

[02:29:20.380 --> 02:29:21.340]
He's a super star.

[02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:31.380]
He's a super star.

[02:29:31.380 --> 02:29:35.260]
He was hanging in the tree, he was speaking in the ring or in the bell.

[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:37.040]
He was in his pants, can't keep it in his pants.

[02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:40.820]
So he ate the food and they had a kiss.

[02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:43.000]
That's what things got in real.

[02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:45.300]
He said, look, I'm pissed.

[02:29:46.260 --> 02:29:48.120]
And it seems that when she said,

[02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:51.500]
if they both look back on the outside,

[02:29:51.840 --> 02:29:54.360]
she's not being worth it to strive.

[02:29:55.120 --> 02:29:57.100]
Can't keep it in his pants.

[02:29:59.420 --> 02:30:02.320]
Can't keep it in his pants.

[02:30:03.260 --> 02:30:05.580]
That day in Eagle Carrow,

[02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:08.580]
he won't look back but not old.

[02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:11.100]
But now he's chasing my home.

[02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:15.160]
No more words he could speak.

[02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:17.500]
No more words he could speak,

[02:30:17.820 --> 02:30:19.660]
unless it's here's a word she.

[02:30:20.840 --> 02:30:24.300]
Now, COVID knows he's got a good lawyer

[02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:28.240]
to paint the cheerleader on these two.

[02:30:29.100 --> 02:30:31.300]
His wife won't say a thing

[02:30:31.300 --> 02:30:34.980]
with a field of honking ring on these two.

[02:30:38.980 --> 02:30:42.420]
Yo, you will put the ring on.

[02:30:44.060 --> 02:30:47.100]
Who's gonna be next girl before you come on earth?

[02:30:48.180 --> 02:30:49.360]
I don't know.

[02:30:50.220 --> 02:30:51.920]
The stings are so crazy.

[02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:56.820]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:31:02.040 --> 02:31:04.300]
I'm so deep in your eyes

[02:31:04.300 --> 02:31:06.620]
The poll shifted more and more every time

[02:31:06.620 --> 02:31:08.680]
When he leaves his house as a recover,

[02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:11.320]
And Booster Runny is gaining info.

[02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:13.900]
Such funny things for me to try to plain.

[02:31:14.180 --> 02:31:16.280]
The emphasis is that three days, the tips to plain,

[02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:18.600]
Cuz I know I don't understand

[02:31:18.600 --> 02:31:20.920]
Who the hell's supporting, Gary Coleman.

[02:31:41.460 --> 02:31:43.240]
I think you're not just fine, didn't they?

[02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:44.540]
No, they were great.

[02:31:44.840 --> 02:31:45.700]
Come on to chapter one.

[02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:48.140]
I love the way that baby ends, don't you?

[02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:50.140]
Man, real abrupt.

[02:31:50.140 --> 02:31:54.240]
Come back to one at five, 60, WNVQM, we got the mad dog stand by, he'll be here two to four.

[02:31:54.640 --> 02:31:57.080]
Hank Goldberg at four, we got Panther preview, any interest?

[02:31:57.600 --> 02:32:02.380]
Panther's against the islanders tonight at the Macarena, preview at seven again, time seven, 30 with jugs into the clown.

[02:32:03.100 --> 02:32:06.720]
And then you got after the game, Eddie Kay and Joe and Mark overnight, two to five in the morning.

[02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:09.500]
You know what, it comes to having your carpets cleaned in time for these holidays coming up.

[02:32:09.860 --> 02:32:13.840]
Thanksgiving is just a days away and then of course you got Christmas and Shannuka, New Year's, all of these things.

[02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:15.000]
Why not do it now?

[02:32:15.300 --> 02:32:16.660]
Call our good friends and draw concepts.

[02:32:16.660 --> 02:32:20.480]
When you make that call, ask them how you can say 15% on your next carpet cleaning.

[02:32:20.500 --> 02:32:22.520]
When they get done, you'll be amazed. I guarantee you.

[02:32:22.780 --> 02:32:23.820]
I'll bet you most life on it.

[02:32:24.140 --> 02:32:27.320]
You'll look down on the floor and say they just look like brand new carpeting just laid on the floor.

[02:32:27.420 --> 02:32:30.760]
And that's exactly what they do, which is why I've used them for over 20 years in my home.

[02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:35.560]
They make even the schmutziest looking carpets look just like brand new, because they dry clean your carpets.

[02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:40.120]
They leave them sparkling, clean, vibrant and color, soft to the touch smelling lemony fresh, they grind a couple of hours.

[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:43.700]
It's like somebody came in with the magic wand and performed a miracle on your floor.

[02:32:43.700 --> 02:32:46.480]
They're doing it right in town for like I said, a coons age.

[02:32:46.980 --> 02:32:52.040]
And not only that, but they do a spectacular job on your oriental rugs in your drapery and a pulse for all of these things as well.

[02:32:52.460 --> 02:32:55.420]
And to give you a written guaranteed price up front before they start the job.

[02:32:55.580 --> 02:32:59.260]
All the way around, you can't beat these stupendous jobs that they do for you at dry concepts.

[02:32:59.740 --> 02:33:02.540]
Call them today, tool free and get your house looking really great for the holidays.

[02:33:02.860 --> 02:33:06.040]
Call 1-800-248-5071.

[02:33:06.460 --> 02:33:08.860]
That's 1-800-248-5071.

[02:33:09.240 --> 02:33:11.700]
Clean today, entertain tonight with our friends at dry concepts.

[02:33:12.620 --> 02:33:15.920]
And love calls. This is Forth Real by Sixty.

[02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:18.120]
The Way to A.M.

[02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:22.920]
Part of the same old seafood restaurant.

[02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:23.320]
Here.

[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:27.180]
Skip the red lobster and come on in to Erica's Red Snapper.

I'm going to give you an update of what took place just now off the air.

[02:34:19.540 --> 02:34:20.940]
Because I think it's important to hear this.

[02:34:21.340 --> 02:34:25.220]
Howard just called the radio station Howard David, who I get along with great.

[02:34:25.700 --> 02:34:30.500]
I thought he called me an asshole saying I was trying to stir it up.

[02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:32.820]
My point back to Howard is don't listen.

[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:34.840]
Listen to 101.5.

[02:34:34.940 --> 02:34:35.760]
Let me see what age group.

[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:37.640]
101.5 for Howard.

[02:34:38.020 --> 02:34:39.740]
Maybe 102.7.

[02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:42.920]
Some easily listening love music.

[02:34:43.220 --> 02:34:50.860]
So you could focus on your wife and your family and the grandkids instead of listening and always calling the radio station.

[02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:54.460]
He's becoming Howard, the caller, like Howard from Boka.

[02:34:54.820 --> 02:34:55.460]
Howard from Boka.

[02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:59.040]
It's like it, you know, it's okay.

[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:01.920]
So anyway, he's listening.

[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:05.680]
So just wanted to get the message out and don't call my show to just for a record.

[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:08.380]
Don't call off the air because I don't want to talk to you.

[02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:11.400]
And I don't want to hear you on the private line.

[02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:13.960]
Congratulations. You know the private line number. That's great.

[02:35:14.260 --> 02:35:16.320]
But don't call because you're not coming on this show.

[02:35:16.880 --> 02:35:19.120]
You've got your three hours five to eight.

[02:35:19.860 --> 02:35:20.800]
Monday through Friday.

[02:35:21.140 --> 02:35:23.860]
You can talk all you want, but you're not coming on this show.

[02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:25.500]
And we'll leave it at that.

[02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:28.080]
All right. I got nothing against you.

[02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:30.100]
You seem like a decent person.

[02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:36.660]
And I know you've been getting that taking a big hit on the radio station from everybody else, but it's over.

[02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:37.520]
Me and you done.

[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:43.380]
There's my story. It's sad but true.

[02:35:44.020 --> 02:35:47.820]
I'm a sex addict and I want you.

[02:35:48.660 --> 02:35:50.660]
I love sex.

[02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:53.100]
Every way.

[02:35:54.660 --> 02:35:56.660]
So grab some lotion.

[02:35:56.660 --> 02:35:59.840]
Come on. Let's play.

[02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:00.600]
Hey.

[02:36:01.660 --> 02:36:02.380]
Oh.

[02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:07.940]
Hi. How you doing?

[02:36:10.300 --> 02:36:11.380]
Who's your daddy?

[02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:12.160]
Who's your daddy?

[02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:13.720]
Oh.

[02:36:15.940 --> 02:36:16.660]
Oh.

[02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:17.300]
Oh.

[02:36:19.220 --> 02:36:19.780]
Oh.

[02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:20.420]
Oh.

[02:36:24.260 --> 02:36:26.920]
I used to think it was a crazy thing.

[02:36:27.220 --> 02:36:30.220]
My mind was always on my thing on my way.

[02:36:30.220 --> 02:36:32.960]
But there's no answer. I'm fired from jail.

[02:36:33.740 --> 02:36:35.920]
I saw a president around around mail.

[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:38.860]
I love to get it while I'm hard at work.

[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:41.740]
Grab my zipper, give it a little care.

[02:36:42.620 --> 02:36:44.360]
I don't get it from my wife.

[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:45.420]
I'm a man.

[02:36:45.420 --> 02:36:48.000]
That's why they call me president around around mail.

[02:36:48.280 --> 02:36:50.840]
There's nothing sexually out of new.

[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:53.900]
Come on out there bring a friend out there.

[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:56.940]
I'll see if I'm a window sail.

[02:36:57.440 --> 02:37:00.040]
And come to Mr. Sexy around around mail.

[02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:02.120]
I can't see if they got a mob.

[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:08.380]
I can do you two words where I don't get yourself into a mob.

[02:37:08.940 --> 02:37:12.900]
Cause I knew all the cakey stuff I'm a hobo.

[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.220]
I'm not a prey and I can please say yes.

[02:37:15.700 --> 02:37:18.020]
I'm a sexer like I can't face.

[02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:21.040]
You've got heavy good up sale.

[02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:24.160]
You've had it from run around mail.

[02:37:25.340 --> 02:37:26.460]
How you doing honey?

[02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:29.220]
How you having a mind on fire drinking food?

[02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:30.760]
Hey look I'm on a safe shirt.

[02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:31.940]
It says I'm the president.

[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:33.560]
I love hugs and jokes.

[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:36.280]
I love you.

[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:36.860]
I love you.

[02:37:38.300 --> 02:37:41.560]
If anybody has a opinion

[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:44.880]
dissenting from all way

[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:49.200]
we'll place your name into the system

[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:53.520]
and send a me out the stage.

[02:37:54.260 --> 02:37:56.540]
Don't even bother to question.

[02:37:57.820 --> 02:37:59.880]
Just follow and don't fade.

[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:04.280]
Everybody's turning classes.

[02:38:05.620 --> 02:38:07.200]

you're watching all of you.

[02:38:16.620 --> 02:38:19.940]
Everyone does a speech on.

[02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:23.260]
So what do you do?

[02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:26.960]
This does this forlations.

[02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:30.120]
And all you might let go.

[02:38:31.720 --> 02:38:34.660]

[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:41.500]
You've got to hate those Jews.

[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:45.300]
And Clinton's liberals too.

[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:49.780]
Believe everything we tell you.

[02:38:51.140 --> 02:38:52.580]

We don't mind to see our jobs go.

[02:39:13.660 --> 02:39:15.660]
A side of Canada is good.

[02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:19.480]
We're passing painted by jail.

[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:24.180]
We know, don't need no stupid books.

[02:39:24.860 --> 02:39:27.500]
All that war is crazy.

[02:39:28.540 --> 02:39:30.560]
The tax is arisen with.

[02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:34.900]
Everybody's turning classes.

[02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:37.440]

Prozac not working.

[02:40:28.420 --> 02:40:30.720]
Lithium just doesn't seem to do it for you anymore.

[02:40:31.420 --> 02:40:32.600]
Are you unable to cope?

[02:40:33.180 --> 02:40:35.700]

So, when the pressures of everyday life get you down.

[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:12.980]
I need this on my desk by seven o'clock.

[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:14.720]
The test came back positive.

[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:15.720]
I'm pregnant.

[02:41:16.100 --> 02:41:16.660]
Honey.

[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:20.360]
Just reach for that little blue bottle and say,

Fug at all.

[02:41:24.660 --> 02:41:25.220]
Alright.

[02:41:27.780 --> 02:41:28.340]
Oh.

[02:41:31.300 --> 02:41:33.660]
You and I went to the bar.

[02:41:34.060 --> 02:41:36.060]
We drank some whiskey from the jar.

[02:41:36.420 --> 02:41:38.540]
We got drunk all over town.

[02:41:38.980 --> 02:41:40.920]
Then I asked you to go down.

[02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:42.240]
You go up to it.

[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:44.560]
Like a master but soon there.

[02:41:44.960 --> 02:41:45.560]
Was disaster.

[02:41:46.020 --> 02:41:47.780]
The food sure went down easy.

[02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:50.220]
Now you're saying you're queasy.

[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:52.600]
It felt good just like it should.

[02:41:52.820 --> 02:41:53.780]
But then it's done.

[02:41:53.940 --> 02:41:54.680]
Cause you were drunk.

[02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:56.040]
You spilled your guts.

[02:41:57.160 --> 02:41:58.460]
Puking on my guts.

[02:41:59.700 --> 02:42:02.120]
This drunk in horror is really quick.

[02:42:02.380 --> 02:42:05.580]
I looked down to see her last snack at come right back.

[02:42:06.780 --> 02:42:07.960]
Puking on my sack.

[02:42:09.900 --> 02:42:13.240]
I thought I could get a decent hammer.

[02:42:14.620 --> 02:42:18.100]
But dinner on my boner is a bummer.

[02:42:19.140 --> 02:42:21.380]
And now my laugh is full of crap.

[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:23.640]
Cause my monster take off your console.

[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:24.880]
Spill your guts.

[02:42:25.780 --> 02:42:27.140]
Puking on my guts.

[02:42:28.860 --> 02:42:32.400]
I was hoping for a decent BJ.

[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:37.040]
But now I am wearing Chinese buffet.

[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:40.680]
All my bones were getting louder.

[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:42.920]
Now my laugh looked like cramped chowder.

[02:42:43.100 --> 02:42:43.880]
Nasty slut.

[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:46.460]
Puking on my guts.

[02:42:57.760 --> 02:42:59.940]
I should have held back my froth.

[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:01.020]
You will laugh your lunch.

[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:03.240]
Now my laugh turned to disgust.

[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:05.600]
Puking on my nuts.

[02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:10.780]
Puking on my nuts.

[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:13.440]

Who would you like to have your daughter admire?

[02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:21.740]
Be a role model for your daughter if you had one and maybe you do.

[02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:24.900]
Hillary Clinton, the ice princess, got 83.

[02:43:25.300 --> 02:43:26.500]
She wins hands down your pants.

[02:43:26.500 --> 02:43:27.120]
You ready for that?

We're talking today about why men cheat.

[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:54.340]
I've just done it because it felt good at the time.

[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:57.760]
I didn't think about it and I didn't concern myself with my wife.

[02:49:58.200 --> 02:50:01.480]
She just got boring so I got to run and around.

[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:03.400]
And I'm above reproach on that.

[02:50:05.100 --> 02:50:07.840]
If you want to chase women, go do it.

[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:10.120]

[02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:11.620]

Are you willing to allow him to cheat?

[02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:26.880]
Do you believe that you can look your fiance in the eye and say,

[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:29.140]
I want that instead of you and go do it?

[02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:29.600]

I'm kidding.

[02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:30.980]
I filled my tank up.

[02:52:02.820 --> 02:52:04.620]
I just spent every per joint.

[02:52:05.120 --> 02:52:07.700]
Now I'm way past you know.

[02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:10.820]
For now I will jump out this window.

[02:52:12.600 --> 02:52:16.140]
This message made for by the community to keep the market in the dark ages.

[02:52:16.520 --> 02:52:17.740]
And they're doing a great job, by the way.

[02:52:17.820 --> 02:52:21.360]
22-2 at 560 WQM 221 votes on a pool.

[02:52:22.460 --> 02:52:24.180]
And Hillary is untouchable.

[02:52:24.360 --> 02:52:24.880]
When you touch her?

[02:52:25.040 --> 02:52:25.620]
No, that's awful.

[02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:26.440]
I rest my case.

[02:52:27.140 --> 02:52:31.100]
What famous living person would you like to think is a role model for your daughter if you had a daughter?

[02:52:31.940 --> 02:52:33.080]
Hillary Clinton 89.

[02:52:33.800 --> 02:52:33.940]
Woo!

[02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:37.780]
Susan Sarandon 36, Marine Dowd 31.

[02:52:38.040 --> 02:52:40.160]
They'd be proud to emulate Marine Dowd.

[02:52:40.440 --> 02:52:41.440]
She's a little out.

[02:52:42.420 --> 02:52:45.240]
To asshole in elders 31, Britney Spears 30.

[02:52:45.540 --> 02:52:46.920]
Don't they always say you respect your elders?

[02:52:47.200 --> 02:52:47.960]
How many's Britney God?

[02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:49.020]
About 30, man.

[02:52:49.880 --> 02:52:53.920]
Oprah 29, San Rodeo Carter 27, Howdy Pressing.

[02:52:53.920 --> 02:53:00.500]
Maria Travertine 19 Natalie Mainz 15 and Nicole Kibben has still got that same wrinkled dozen.

[02:53:01.720 --> 02:53:03.420]
22-Till Mad Dog time at 2 o'clock.

[02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:04.820]
If you're fat you've tried them all.

[02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:07.700]
You've tried the watermelon dyke, the atkins dyke, the skatkins dyke.

[02:53:07.740 --> 02:53:10.480]
You've tried stillman and the swillman, all of the others.

[02:53:10.660 --> 02:53:11.260]
And you're still fat.

[02:53:11.980 --> 02:53:15.560]
If you fail them all of the others, maybe because you're like not too smart.

[02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:17.220]
Maybe you just don't understand it.

[02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:20.960]
And that's why balance for life will help you out because they do all the figuring out for you.

[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:25.160]
They don't have to let you worry about carb counting or calorie counting because they do it for you.

[02:53:25.220 --> 02:53:28.860]
Like I said, all you have to do is worry about reaching down and grabbing your black sack.

[02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:33.380]
And what's self-respecting guy don't want to reach down and grab their black sack?

[02:53:33.680 --> 02:53:36.780]
Or just, anyway, just reach outside the door by 6 o'clock in the morning.

[02:53:36.880 --> 02:53:38.380]
Every morning it's there waiting for you.

[02:53:38.660 --> 02:53:44.780]
And inside your black sack from balance for life are three gourmet meals, two delicious snacks, everything fresh and delicious.

Nothing frozen, no chemicals, no pre-fabricated crap in a box.

[02:53:48.420 --> 02:53:49.340]
Just really good stuff.

[02:53:49.700 --> 02:53:54.300]
And plenty of food in there to keep you full and happy and to satisfy it all day long so you won't have to be cheap neither.

[02:53:54.680 --> 02:53:58.240]
And don't forget, balance for life is the only company that should pick between two choices.

[02:53:58.660 --> 02:54:02.140]
For each meal every day that you're in a program, you fill out a menu once a week, you fax it back to them.

[02:54:02.400 --> 02:54:03.860]
And exactly what you want, it's in there.

[02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:06.960]
So let balance for life finally help you lose that weight.

[02:54:07.100 --> 02:54:10.120]
If you're overweight out of shape, if you're disgusted, we've earned pub tense.

[02:54:10.240 --> 02:54:13.800]
If you're diabetic around a verge of it and I beg you, believe me, you don't want to go there.

[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:18.920]
So call balance for life at 9.54, 568.32.29.

[02:56:56.040 --> 02:56:56.040]

[02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:56.060]

[02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:56.060]

[02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:56.060]

[02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:56.060]

[02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:56.060]

[02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:56.060]

[02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:56.060]

[02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:56.060]

[02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:56.060]

[02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:56.060]

[02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:56.060]

[02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:56.060]

[02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:56.060]

[02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:56.060]

[02:56:56.380 --> 02:56:56.460]
Oh.

[02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:29.940]

[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:31.400]

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:32.020]

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:32.020]

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:32.020]

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:32.020]

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:32.020]

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:32.020]

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:32.020]

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:32.020]

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:32.020]

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:32.020]

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:32.020]

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:32.020]

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:32.020]

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:32.020]

[02:57:32.180 --> 02:57:32.180]

[02:57:32.180 --> 02:57:32.180]

[02:57:38.260 --> 02:57:40.940]
You pointed all your life for them to return.

[02:57:41.700 --> 02:57:44.820]
Okay, maybe you haven't waited all your life and don't give a rat's ass that they're

[02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:48.340]
together again, but they're playing just for you.

[02:57:52.900 --> 02:57:54.760]
Simon and Garfanto.

[02:57:57.500 --> 02:58:00.480]
One night only, one hit only because they're tired.

[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:10.920]
It's the return of Simon and Garfanto, barely live and on stage.

[02:58:32.260 --> 02:58:34.600]
Get your tickets now.

[02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:37.720]
For Simon and Garfanto on their live, which is fairly tour.

[02:58:38.260 --> 02:58:41.280]
Come to think of a future self of baby Sidermen go to a movie and stand.

[02:58:48.820 --> 02:58:51.460]
Alright, who's that group of Muslims?

[02:58:53.840 --> 02:58:54.880]
Helping terrorists.

[02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:02.000]
It's a bunch of backward thinking continentalists in the Taliban.

[02:59:04.460 --> 02:59:06.460]
Who are those Panadi?

[02:59:08.620 --> 02:59:10.100]
They're not filled with hate.

[02:59:12.220 --> 02:59:16.760]
If you're caught stealing it's your handle and you take the Taliban.

[02:59:19.080 --> 02:59:29.340]
The Taliban, the Taliban, because they rule Afghanistan, but they're up to no good.

[02:59:30.720 --> 02:59:37.300]
A Taliban man, he doesn't give a damn about his country's starving masses.

[02:59:38.520 --> 02:59:44.900]
He shows where the driver passes, so we can go and kick their asses.

[02:59:44.900 --> 02:59:45.460]
Welcome.

[02:59:45.660 --> 02:59:51.220]
Who keeps all the women covered at the toe?

[02:59:53.060 --> 02:59:58.220]
It could be Osama under there, you'd never know the Taliban.

[03:00:00.900 --> 03:00:09.880]
The Taliban can, the Taliban can, because they rule Afghanistan, but they're up to no good.

[03:00:15.120 --> 03:00:18.300]
So I want to meet a BBC news there on the sports segment.

[03:00:18.540 --> 03:00:21.500]
And I see a bunch of Brits acting like real assholes, which of course they always are.

[03:00:22.020 --> 03:00:24.720]
And it looked to me like they were a Namdaam square in Amsterdam.

[03:00:24.740 --> 03:00:26.980]
I said that can't be in Britain, that's an Amsterdam.

[03:00:27.880 --> 03:00:31.300]
And then there you have back the way, there was like the world palace and it was Amstadam.

[03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:33.820]
They're getting ready for some big soccer match or some cramp like that.

[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:34.380]
I said.

[03:00:34.640 --> 03:00:36.340]
And I said Goddamn, that's Amsterdam.

[03:00:37.120 --> 03:00:40.760]
And it was, I just mentioned that in passing and you'll be interested in know they're acting like assholes.

[03:00:40.860 --> 03:00:41.340]
Did I mention that?

[03:00:41.480 --> 03:00:41.880]
Yes you did.

[03:00:42.200 --> 03:00:45.740]
151 at 560 WDQM, hey listen, you're an idiot if you don't get you a new actress.

[03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:49.320]
So the older one is lumpy and bumpy and not doing you good and your back is hurting from it.

[03:00:49.360 --> 03:00:50.260]
You're not getting a good night's sleep.

[03:00:50.540 --> 03:00:51.220]
You feel like crap.

[03:00:51.380 --> 03:00:53.420]
You'll feel a lot better with a great mattress and dollar mattress.

[03:00:53.880 --> 03:00:57.820]
George knows it, Miguel knows it, Bill Cabrara knows it, fat boy knows it, I know it.

[03:00:58.020 --> 03:01:00.060]
And the reason I know is that it's been calling them for years.

[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:02.880]
Every time it's time to replace the mattress, you make them one simple call.

[03:01:02.880 --> 03:01:06.920]
You don't get sucked in by those betting in departments stores that rip you off because they got a big overhead to pay.

[03:01:07.280 --> 03:01:09.060]
You call 1-800-MACRUS, that's it.

[03:01:09.180 --> 03:01:09.660]
That's all you do.

[03:01:09.800 --> 03:01:11.040]
You tell them what time you want them to show up.

[03:01:11.380 --> 03:01:14.300]
Any tour window between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. 7 a.m.

[03:01:14.300 --> 03:01:14.880]
and they'll be there.

[03:01:15.220 --> 03:01:22.620]
No shell games, no phony claims, no phony promises, no bait and swish, just unbeatable discount prices on the best goods in the world every day, including now,

[03:01:22.980 --> 03:01:23.960]
Steer and Savannah's Foster.

[03:01:24.300 --> 03:01:28.740]
So don't get sucked in by those so-called giants in the mattress industry because they rip your ass off.

[03:01:28.740 --> 03:01:30.740]
Pick up the phone right now, call dial a mattress.

Projects could I could hear the word asshole?

[03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:59.200]
Have you ever turned on the radio and said, that song makes me sick.

[03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:05.200]
Girl, well now, KOPEC-TAKE Records presents, songs that make you wanna throw up.

I've got the dots, a goner, a chuck on you, I've got a head case, a spew in you.

[03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:14.680]
Stand away from the door, pick this up like I...

[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:18.320]
Yes, I'm songs that make you wanna throw up. You get to sting.

[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:18.480]
I'm a king.

[03:02:19.640 --> 03:02:23.300]
A firefly, whoo, my Lord, call me.

[03:02:23.580 --> 03:02:27.200]
A complete bar for rum, and who could forget their classic?

[03:02:27.460 --> 03:02:30.380]
Puk, puk, puk, puk, puk and whoo?

[03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:32.780]
Puk, puk, puk, puk and whoo?

[03:02:33.080 --> 03:02:35.460]
Puk, puk, puk, puk and whoo?

[03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:36.560]
Puk, puk, puk.

[03:02:36.660 --> 03:02:39.320]
You know you make me wanna blow with my groceries.

[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:43.580]
I pour my chalmal, I pump my puk, puk, puk, puk.

[03:02:43.580 --> 03:02:45.940]
I pump my new girl, I keep on human.

[03:02:45.940 --> 03:02:50.660]
If you can do the puke it, sounds that make you want to throw up.

[03:02:50.700 --> 03:02:52.360]
Bye, bye baby!

[03:02:57.920 --> 03:03:02.480]
Coming next year, the King of Proph, heard it for your hometown,

[03:03:03.160 --> 03:03:07.000]
touring to benefit the Cardinal Classy School for wayward boys.

[03:03:07.180 --> 03:03:09.440]
It's Michael Schatz.

[03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:14.320]
You know my girl, ladies and pinkies, I've got a very fast but tight.

[03:03:14.840 --> 03:03:15.740]
Michael Schatz!

[03:03:16.200 --> 03:03:17.240]
You know what?

[03:03:17.860 --> 03:03:22.780]
Because I've found a lady child that's gonna marry a physical wife.

[03:03:23.100 --> 03:03:24.460]
Michael Schatz.

[03:03:24.920 --> 03:03:27.660]
Yes, Michael performs all of his great hits,

[03:03:27.960 --> 03:03:29.840]
from oldies with the Jackson Five.

[03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:34.420]
Still learning the ABCs, I'm getting down on my knees.

[03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:37.860]
Removing the younger age ABCs,

[03:03:37.960 --> 03:03:40.220]
taught on me, baby, you and me.

[03:03:40.320 --> 03:03:42.860]
That's right, from the time the students of the Jackson Five,

[03:03:43.020 --> 03:03:46.620]
to the Classics' filler work, Michael Jackson's benefit to her aims to please.

[03:03:46.960 --> 03:03:50.120]
The people that surround myself, we're not too bad and I'll

[03:03:50.120 --> 03:03:53.140]
to call me big brother, so I'm a better file.

[03:03:53.520 --> 03:03:56.940]
And I know what to do, file, I just sit for a while

[03:03:56.940 --> 03:03:59.280]
and beat it, beat it, beat it, fuck it.

[03:03:59.500 --> 03:03:59.940]
No, pop.

[03:04:00.420 --> 03:04:02.280]
I ain't beat it, beat it, beat it.

[03:04:02.280 --> 03:04:03.560]
Michael Jackson.

[03:04:04.020 --> 03:04:07.320]
Sometimes I'm so depressed that I just sit around so

[03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:10.900]
can't wait before a call, from a calling call again.

[03:04:11.280 --> 03:04:14.360]
When I'm home alone, sitting naked by the phone,

[03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:15.800]
I ain't beat it, beat it.

[03:04:15.900 --> 03:04:20.480]
And be one of the five lucky boys to receive backstage passes

[03:04:20.480 --> 03:04:23.600]
to hang out in Michael Jackson's dressing room.

[03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:26.120]
Michael Jackson's benefit to her.

[03:04:26.400 --> 03:04:28.780]
Hey, yeah, Michael, yes, Bobby.

[03:04:28.780 --> 03:04:31.160]
See, is that your real skin color?

[03:04:32.060 --> 03:04:35.840]
It's inside with cats, but I know a game that we can play

[03:04:35.840 --> 03:04:38.140]
to find out, and simply fly.

[03:04:38.700 --> 03:04:40.120]
It's time to free Willie.

[03:04:40.460 --> 03:04:45.560]
Say, say, say what you want, that you know who I

[03:04:45.560 --> 03:04:50.560]
give a affection, but maybe don't know how to read.

[03:04:51.080 --> 03:04:54.560]
But then don't boys give me reaction.

[03:04:54.700 --> 03:04:56.200]
And here the rousing finale.

[03:04:56.200 --> 03:04:58.180]
Yes, Michael sings the song he wrote for the show

[03:04:58.180 --> 03:05:01.740]
or the world with the Vienna voice choir backing him up.

[03:05:01.740 --> 03:05:04.520]
I don't like girls.

[03:05:05.060 --> 03:05:07.660]
I like me of children.

[03:05:09.440 --> 03:05:13.300]
They are the ones who turn me on and hate.

[03:05:13.820 --> 03:05:15.380]
I hope they win.

[03:05:18.180 --> 03:05:20.720]
It's a choice of making.

[03:05:22.500 --> 03:05:24.220]
I like school.

[03:05:24.680 --> 03:05:27.460]
But it's true.

[03:05:27.880 --> 03:05:29.500]
We make the greatest name.

[03:05:31.900 --> 03:05:34.760]
Here are other great Michael Jackson classics.

[03:05:35.540 --> 03:05:36.640]
White Billy's jeans.

[03:05:37.100 --> 03:05:39.600]
And of course, smooth criminal.

[03:05:39.940 --> 03:05:43.080]
You have to Michael Jackson's tour to benefit the Carmel Clancy School

[03:05:43.080 --> 03:05:44.220]

Get your tickets now.

[03:05:45.380 --> 03:05:47.960]
Boys under 10 have been in free when a cupid bind no one.

[03:05:48.520 --> 03:05:49.300]
They're white.

[03:05:49.580 --> 03:05:51.100]
They're really really tight.

[03:05:51.540 --> 03:05:55.140]
They're really really tight.

[03:05:55.360 --> 03:05:55.520]
Oh.

[03:05:57.360 --> 03:05:58.540]
Bye bye bye.

[03:05:59.180 --> 03:06:01.140]
The middle-wide show I'm classic.

[03:06:01.420 --> 03:06:03.500]
I'm going to be playing for my hair.
