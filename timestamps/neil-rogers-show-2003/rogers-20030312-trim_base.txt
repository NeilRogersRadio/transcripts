[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.700]
oh

[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.680]
When I'm watching basketball on TV

[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.500]
One man is annoying me

[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.340]
yelling words of nonsense

[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.600]
tick-a-vee-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e

[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.640]
And when someone goes baseline, he starts screaming things don't age to leave

[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.180]
Screaching like a fetchy, tick-e-vee

[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.380]
Tick-e-vee, tick-e-vee, tick-e-vee

[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.520]
And tick-e-vee, he should shut his pie hole, tick-e-vee

[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.380]
Err...

[00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.500]
When he is on camera, the player from his head is blindly me

[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.380]
Where did this guy come from? Tick-e-vee

[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.300]
Everything is awesome, and everyone's his BTP

[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.880]
Wish he'd keep his traction to give me

[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.180]
Tickky-vee, tickee-vee

[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.040]
Tickky-vee, tickee-vee

[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.540]
Tickky-vee, tickee-vee

[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:38.240]
Tickky-vee, tickee-vee

[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.300]
Here's an example of you put somebody in the way of the way of knowing on TV a whole bunch of videos will say he's really great

[00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.200]
919 at 560 WQ AM. You know we have so much crap. I don't even know where to begin that

[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.400]
That one huh?

[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.460]
Oh, we'll get to it just relax about the facts. Okay. We'll get to the facts just like Jack Webb

[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.180]
Where we have all these calls when we don't really need any right here's Miami. Hello

[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.380]
Miami. Oh

[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.940]
Good morning and back to you

[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.340]
I'm sorry I wasn't able to catch all of your program yesterday morning

[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.320]
I finally got to work and had to get out of the car. Yeah, I was

[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.100]
Tempted through the tool was by tiny Tim on that list. No, that would have been a good one

[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.120]
Oh, okay, and even though this wasn't actually a commercial song it wasn't commercial

[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.760]
It was the screechy B.I.N.G. or the Florida Florida lottery about two years ago

[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.440]
It kept me away from the Florida lottery for six months. You don't have a nice day and back to you

[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.100]
I guess what we're gonna do is pick up for the

[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.320]
Apparently, you know what I don't care. I don't care. Whatever makes them happy

[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.480]
That's our job here to entertain the masses out there make them happy

[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.140]
Now here's a fact from a chronic a fact from West Palm who loves me like crazy by the way

[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.060]
So good we like him a lot anybody it sucks around

[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.980]
Especially if they suck real good. It says I tuned into mole for a little bit this morning hurt

[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.360]
His Percy like comedy routine, but the funniest part was moments before

[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.480]
Nearly as so nervous that his trigger finger was really jumpy. Oh, I heard that a

[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.660]
Caller I heard that a caller called in with the deep voice and said Goldie

[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.800]
What do you think about the Kansas-Chances night and right away Mo

[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.140]
Went click and cut him off got the events that he was asking about Miami's basketball game tonight in the big East tournament

[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.100]
It was hysterical Mo beg for the guy to call back and got to know give up the number about three times

[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.060]
He's a nervous fellow with Disney should be well

[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.740]
He must have seen that article by Greg read with very jackass

[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.500]
It was a mistake. Sorry. I didn't mean to do that. Yeah, I heard that. Yeah, that was very amusing

[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.820]
Yeah, in addition to which I mean, why is he begging the other guy to call back were they that desperate for calls?

[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.960]
Come on. I mean, what's it all about Mo who gives a crap about that?

[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.740]
God butch up a little bit you silly old man

[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.540]
And I probably do have pants that are older than the beast and older than Robert Griefer

[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.900]
By the way, you're not gonna get the beast laid. I'll tell you that right now

[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.600]
If you would start up a Helen Keller school for the blind

[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.600]
Hey, that's a good idea you there you go leave it to me you might have a chance

[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.720]
You know, I've got a really interesting question speaking of the beast

[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.340]
Yes

[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.980]
Now I'm thinking if you could find a woman. I'm not gonna say okay a woman of any

[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.800]
Just what he may so far. Okay woman who looks basically like him

[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.880]
Oh, yeah, what do you have sex with her? You see what I'm saying in other words?

[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.400]
Um, you had no seriously listen to me. Yeah, cuz I'm asking myself the same question

[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.300]
What I have sex with somebody who looks like me other than myself. Of course, and the answer is obviously no chance

[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.560]
No way right right would

[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.020]
Carlos have well, I mean let's fix it even know what they are. I mean he's an indeterminate origin

[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.980]
You find a one of the sand. Yeah, no, that's a very good part. Huh?

[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.180]
I'll ask him. I mean for example what hey do you think Hank would have sex with a woman who looks just like him?

[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.180]
No, no chance he knows better, huh?

[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.080]
Seriously stop and think about that. I think it's a magnificent point

[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.440]
No, it's like that old guy would have sex with somebody. I'm talking about people. I want to go screw around

[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.360]
I'm talking about happily married people

[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.980]
Happy horse like George like that old adage

[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.000]
I would never belong to a club that would have me as a member in another words if you're a big fat grotesque

[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.240]
Smelly ugly guy would you have sex with a big fat smelly ugly woman now? We do have somebody in a building

[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.060]
I'm not gonna mention his name on the air, but well, it would be a very poor taste

[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.300]
You follow what I'm saying you would never in fact he has his whole family is big and fat. It's the a fat family

[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.300]
So I guess that answers that question and maybe once upon a time nobody in that family was fat

[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.660]
You know, although I think when the kids were born they probably weighed about 60 pounds in that family

[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.340]
But I'm not saying which one I'm talking about right now. Yeah, and where's my mattress fat boy?

[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.680]
He sure talks a good game. You know as he waddles around on a walker

[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.160]
He's he's a graduated to a cane now all right. Let's hear it for fat boy

[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.740]
He's gonna be down there. I don't see him on your list

[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.860]
He's always there treasure Island he ought to be on this celebrity list

[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.040]
Oh, here is a West Palm Beach. Hello

[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.680]

Of re-west military radio communications he intercepted he's regarded as the leading communications monitor in the middle east and works for israeli radio and tv

[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:25.540]
He's broken numerous stories because of his ability to intercept and understand foreign language civilian and radio broadcast and communications

Music of stuff. Yeah, and what they're going to do. I'm not sure if they're gonna do it or not

[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:05.580]
Is they're gonna put up themselves music on those sites and when you click on it to download it

[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.840]
They'll get your IP address

[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.180]
Go play

[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.920]
Internet provider like a well and all these other

[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.120]
People and get your name and address out of there. You're that call. She better cut it out

[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.280]
Yeah, there'll be knocking on his box up under the overpass

[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.120]
Hey, you got it man. What's you guys are talking about man. Yeah, he has no clue. But when I share all about

[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.160]
Thank

[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.780]
Yes, I'm hoping I'm getting one of the books

[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.960]
I hope you can get about half a dozen and I'll put your name all over it. I listen to your 24th step of my friend

[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.340]
Thank you, sir. No problem. See you

[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.740]
There you go. We need about a million like him. Yeah. What are we gonna do to get those ratings back up George?

[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.820]
Oh my god see if I was mo I'd be not worried about my ratings or hangs or man, do anybody else

[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.640]
I'd be worried about the February trend myself, see

[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.480]
I mean ours is gonna be terrible because we know that we're losing the big November and it's gonna be

[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.440]
I'm not making excuses. We know it's gonna be pretty weak

[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.520]
But in his case

[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.240]
He has you know, he's got to live up to like two good months in a row

[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.320]
Not just one month out of the blue that you know like an aberration see what I'm saying

[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:12.020]
He's gonna need a big February so I get that shift ready sharpen up real good if I were you just in case

[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:17.780]
Okay, well, where'd that come from? Why has he resurrected that? That's the second time this Maria heard that right

[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.920]
And he was like he was sharp enough and being the backstabber

[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.060]
I guess he's he's gone the whole gamut of everybody else on the staff

[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.460]
In the one year

[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:30.480]
So now we're like back to the beginning guys you were the you were the first one that he started with and now I guess

[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.780]
Doreen may have been the last one that had ripped an ass yet

[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.920]
So now we're all way back to the beginning and now he's gonna go after your ass again

[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.720]
So you better watch yourself mister

[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.380]
I'll watch my back

[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.200]
Because when he drops the bomb

[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.740]
It's gonna make that mother look like crap man gonna make her look like grandma

[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.880]
It's gonna be one mother moan uh maybe that's what that stands for

[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.320]
Moe of all bombs, huh

[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.700]
Here's our poll question today

[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.760]
Who do you and this is somebody again? We we always enjoy when they facts and good polls

[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.280]
This is the second one I think the last couple of weeks. Who do you think will be the next celebrity to die?

[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.140]
That's you know, it's kind of interesting. It's just speculation. We're not putting a hex on anybody

[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.780]
Although it would be kind of a bad taste if we have somebody on this list in the like

[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.580]
By tomorrow morning. Oh my god. You'll never guess who croaked. You know now that would be bad right

[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:25.240]
Who do you think will be the next celebrity to die and here's my short list so far the the facts here had most of these don I miss

[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.940]
Of course my question there would be how could you tell

[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.900]
He's Ronald Reagan

[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.400]
Jerry Lewis

[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.800]
Bob Hope

[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.540]
Catherine Hepburn which I didn't realize she was still alive and now that we know that she's gotta be right under the

[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.900]
Edge yeah and on this borg nine

[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.780]
Which also we checked out and found out that he's still alive at the age of 142 and so there's the short list now

[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.260]
See the clones are always starting to ring the cousin and of course if you want to put me on there

[00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.160]
That's okay because I think you got a shot you know after that stroke and after working for these people

[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.860]
I guess I'll put myself on there. Why not you're a spring chicken

[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:09.520]
We're not talking about age. We're talking about people are not in the best of health necessarily handled and maybe on the edge

[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.700]
edge of death

[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.480]
And last night on smallville another repeat

[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.860]
You see it

[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.840]
No, I saw that it was a repeat so I averted it but it was the good one where he had the red rocks where he got his rocks red

[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.360]
Oh, David and he became real horny and he was kissing in the and uh

[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.440]
Freedom kissing Lana

[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.980]
How was that French kissing he was feeding kissing on don't say that

[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:39.140]
And then at the end John Schneider had to take that big huge mallet and it a whack that red

[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:45.260]
Thing the red rock yeah, good thing you didn't try to block it with the other hand. Yeah, that would have been almost the time

[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.760]
He just he just very uh, yeah

[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.240]
Cooperatively right right hand out there whichever hand it was and there you go

[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.840]
Just bust my thing and bust my ring and but I'm being in a whole thing fell apart and Clark came back to life

[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.180]
And everybody was hugging him and squeezing him. I'll tell you that that the scene of him there at the end

[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.260]
We're sitting there at the table real close-up was just it made me want to cry

[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.480]
You want to know I wanted to cry?

[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.740]
I don't like because he was so far away. Mm-hmm

[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:16.040]
Anyway, so here's this facts of a letter that was sent to great read general manager of wqa m

[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:22.640]
And of course it's unsigned Greg past it along to me yesterday of course my first impression was just like yours

[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.580]
But then after talking to the muffmeister muff always has to be like Greg's agent, you know, he's always got to be the buffer

[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.040]
You know what that's like he's got to be the buffer the interceptor

[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:36.580]
So anyway, he explained to me what this was all about this was sent as as good comic material which it was nice go on Greg

[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.740]
And by the way, uh, duff also told me to pass a message along

[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.520]
To George, which I'm sure you already know Greg hate you. Yeah, yeah

[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.660]
But anyway, so here's the letter

[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.040]
Dear mr. Read

[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.700]
As a long time listener of your radio station it is with deep regret that I'm compelled to inform you that

[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.140]
I've had it with the Neil Roger showers. Shall I say the Neil and George show

[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:03.900]
Let there be no doubt that Neil is a great talent. He is bright funny, articulate, entertaining, etc

[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:09.900]
What makes him so good is that he's totally unpredictable a lot of use to find myself trying to anticipate his next line

[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.820]
Notice that I said used to because I just can't listen anymore

[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.920]
The reason is quite simple that obnoxious producer of his Jorge George Rodriguez. He's got it spelled both ways

[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.700]
I see I respectfully now wait and wait what to do here the dates that he mentions in here and then start

[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.160]
Thing and put on your thinking cap and think of the week that this was and what was going on that week all right

[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.880]
I respectfully request that you listen to the tapes of the week of February 24th to 20th especially the 10th

[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.900]
11 hour which is when I used to listen

[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.220]
Rodriguez took over the show for our practical purposes to borrow a line from Neil

[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.840]
Rodriguez's as funny as a bleeding hemorrhoid well, that's right

[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:48.880]
He's as predictable as an afternoon thunderstorm during the summer and south Florida sounds gay and that's absolutely nothing to the show

[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.940]
Neil will say got it and he'll respond got it. Ha ha

[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.220]
Need that go on. I think not it's too bad, but I just can't take it any longer

[00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:02.800]
It goes without saying that when Neil retires that I hope and pray that you don't even consider this no talent asshole for a permanent position

[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:10.000]
Please let Neil know how I feel. I'm sure that a great portion of his listeners feel the same way except that they don't take the time to express their views

[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.820]
I'll come back as soon as George is gone in the meantime

[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:18.740]
I'll continue to listen to the rest of your host by the way as George likes to see ad nauseam my favorite host is Ed Kaplan

[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.580]
Good luck. You'll need it signed and ex-listered in the orarger show

[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.740]
No name even

[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:27.500]
Yeah

[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:33.200]
Now if you put those dates in your mind February 24th of 28th when you had the the stroke and you were out

[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:33.780]
Don't know

[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.300]
No, that was a February about the 10 though

[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:40.220]
This is when I already came up here and remember I did the first week and I was getting a little bit better every day

[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.880]
And then on that Saturday night

[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.300]
I didn't have the heat turned on high enough and I woke up Monday morning and say you a note on the 24th

[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.440]
Which is the week he's talking about that I wasn't a beyond that day and you wouldn't even expect me to be on

[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.500]
I could barely talk I had sore throat bad head cold the whole deal was a hundred below zero here

[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.840]
And all of that week as the trooper that I am I showed up

[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:03.800]
And squeaked my way through but again depended on you to carry the show because it would thank goodness that George was there

[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.100]
Because I could barely talk with it with a raw nasty throat like a piece of liver

[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:13.700]
Right and here's this miserable nasty son of a bitch this obnoxious piece of third

[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:18.960]
Pix that oh it's that week a George took over the show. Thank God. He took over the show because I can barely talk

[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.240]
You nasty asshole you hey

[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.760]
I offered to call rimmer up and get in and and this type writing in fact

[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:30.560]
I'm gonna fact you a copy of this during the break I so you can see the typing because it looks very very very

[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:36.700]
Familiar okay another one of our antagonist out there who's listening right now who listens every minute of every god damn

[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:42.780]
They but let me say it again that was the week how amusing it is that he picks out that George basically had to take over the show a lot of part

[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.040]
Because Neil was sick as a dog, okay? Like he didn't know that

[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.740]
Now he didn't know these two god damn stupid spewing his venom and try to sharpen it knife

[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.000]
For you I'm gonna be surprised if he sent it you know what

[00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:00.220]
One of his one of his boyfriends moe. It sounds like the moe myster to me him in one of his cohorts any crap

[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.540]
Let me just tell you right now any crap that happens

[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:07.480]
Even in irractor saying this to any crap that happens don't blame w blame mo

[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.860]
See what I'm saying if you should get hit by a bolt of light that that's right

[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.300]
If something happens if you have a hang nail if you pop a bad hemorrhoid

[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:20.620]
Whatever it is that happens moe and there's a good reason to suspect based on his behavior of the last year

[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:25.120]
For he might have his finger in it somewhere that's right. That's my personal feeling

[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.080]
942 at 560 W. D'Aume don't let me forget to fact you that to letter

[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.540]
Okay, now you're supposed to say see the guys right you're supposed to say be sure to fact me that letter during the break

[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.660]

Next morning, something's not quite right

[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:44.460]
Something feels on the outside of me

[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.960]
The beer wasn't green and so is nothing

[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.120]
Staring at the bathroom, making green water

[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.440]
I went to the doctor to see once the matter

[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.880]
The X-ray showed that I got a green liver

[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.780]
Oi, ow

[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.400]
So down the panaceball, I spent the day old

[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.200]
He's a little bit jealous, we got all those billboards up

[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:51.180]
He's got one and we invited him to come on a show and give the location of his billboard

[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.260]
I, I, I, I, I, come on Mota, you can do better than I, I, I, I

[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.400]
948 at 560 WQAM

[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.880]
All these facts is just pointing out you got that facts right?

[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.180]
Yeah, yeah, I got it

[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:03.980]
That doesn't look familiar

[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.180]
I'm referring to it

[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:05.740]
It does look familiar

[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:10.360]
It looks real familiar to me because this is a, we need child outcomes in Miss Marple on this one

[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.340]
Here's the fact that it says he'll be the next celebrity to die and it says

[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.420]
Oh, now see this isn't bad taste because this is...

[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.620]
Hopefully, not who would you like to sneak croak

[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.180]
But as long as I put me on, they will put Moe on there too, okay?

[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.500]
We don't want any of these people to die

[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.400]
We want them all to live forever

[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.900]
Anybody believe George?

[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:31.180]
No

[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.480]
No, we know, we can hear you sharpening up your knife

[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.240]
And Bert Lancaster is still alive, I don't think so

[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.560]
Yeah, he is?

[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.220]
I'm pretty sure

[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:45.740]
Get outta here, Bert Lancaster, I mean you got me on a couple of those other ones like Catherine Hepburn

[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.680]
Bert Lancaster can't possibly still be alive

[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.820]
I'm pretty sure he's still alive

[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:54.480]
No, he's not, he was doing all of those things on TV where he was like sitting and doing his one-man show

[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.860]
and mumbling about politics and this and that

[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.780]
And I'm sure he's dead, also Maureen or Herrick can't be alive

[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.960]
I'm looking them up

[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.340]
Look, both of those up

[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.100]
Now here's an excellent one, Johnny Cash

[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.340]
Absolutely, I already wrote it down

[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.240]
He, in fact, Rick from Tampus is Johnny Cash and it always looks like he's got both feet in it Rick

[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.120]
And another one perfect one, how could we not have gotten already?

[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.840]
It's just amazing to me how stupid I sometimes am

[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.220]
And the reason I remember it because I saw his promo on CNN

[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:20.780]
During the break

[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.280]
Yeah

[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.380]
Let me give you a clue

[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.020]
Oh, of course

[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.560]
Larry King, I got a couple

[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.820]
Oh, I got a couple of them

[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.960]
He looks like he's right on the edge, you know

[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:36.600]
In fact, you'll notice now he's so hunchbacked that he's almost going to fall over the edge of the table now

[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.200]
When he's interviewing these stiffs, he's like, the hunched right over to the edge of the table

[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.860]
One of these days he's just going to fall right over

[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.080]
Maybe he has Rickets

[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.520]
What about art link letter?

[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.140]
No idea

[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.720]
I don't think anybody remembers who the hell he is except for Vokabrion

[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.820]
Do you want to put him on?

[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.200]
Why not?

[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.400]
I guess, why not?

[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.300]
I got a couple

[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.420]
You do? Choices?

[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.020]
Yeah

[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.060]
Charlton Huston

[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.840]
Oh, now that is so in such bad taste you're going to get almost all upset

[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.160]
Do you son of a bitch?

[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.020]
Charlton Huston

[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.080]
And just because of recent health problems, Jerry Lewis

[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.680]
He's on there already

[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.960]
Oh, wait, there they have

[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.000]
George is worse than the caller

[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.440]
I was just going to say that

[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.620]
You're getting worse than he's caller

[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.500]
Oh, hi, could you put the Macarena on that list?

[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.080]
And speaking of yesterday's poll, there's still vote 9 yesterday

[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:23.680]
With the songs

[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.140]
Yeah

[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.800]
We could have dragged that off for days

[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.980]
Why didn't you tell me about that?

[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.480]
Did you find about Bert Lancaster or Moreno Harrier yet?

[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.960]
Yep, Bert Lancaster is dead

[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.840]
I told you that, he's dead

[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.760]
Oh, but Moreno Harrier is alive

[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.680]
No, yep

[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.020]
She's got to be

[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:38.640]
He's dead?

[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.280]
Yeah, he's dead

[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.240]
And she's alive

[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.320]
Well, one out of two in bed

[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.580]
In fact, they had her out of biography last night, Moreno Harrier

[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.540]
It's funny somebody should mention it, but I didn't watch it

[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.840]
Because I don't really give a flying crab about Moreno Harrier

[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.640]
You know, she's a little premire era, Moreno Harrier

[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.180]
Well, let's put her on there, Moreno Harrier

[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.200]
Don't be putting a Francis over here on there, he's already dead

[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.500]
You know, Francis over here?

[00:27:59.620 --> 00:27:59.740]
No

[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.920]
How about Walter Case, Jr.?

[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.000]
Who?

[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.640]
Just a joke, anyway, I think the most annoying song of all time

[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.920]
It says is the one by Lee Greenwood, proud to be an American

[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.080]
That song makes me want to puke

[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.320]
It said it was good propagated during the Gulf War, but those days are gone

[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.420]
I wish the song was as well

[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.080]
Congratulations to me, my wife and I had a son on Monday

[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:19.920]
We're going to name him Neil

[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.080]
But the religious writer of the hospital wouldn't have lost his original thing

[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.440]
Congratulations, Pally

[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.100]
And yes, Pally, I got your facts too, Fatboy

[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.940]
You see that thing about the story about his friend, Neighbor Dave?

[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:29.320]
No

[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.760]
Which I'm not going to read on the air

[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.020]
I'm not giving that kind of publicity, okay?

[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:36.020]
That's an effect that Fatboy was out eating dinner somewhere with somebody

[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.420]
Recently, you know, oh, in fact, what?

[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:40.380]
He's a celebrity?

[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:41.900]
Fatboy?

[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.040]
Yeah, Jeff High

[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:43.760]
I said that earlier

[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.000]
Jeff High, and in parentheses, Fatboy

[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.960]
Since we're putting local celebrities too, as far as on the station, you know

[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.480]
I mean, if I'm good enough to be on air and mo then why don't we help out Fatboy?

[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.400]
Don I miss Ronald Reagan, Jerry Lewis?

[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.240]
Who do you think will be the next celebrity to die?

[00:28:59.160 --> 00:28:59.960]
The Death Watch?

[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:05.460]
Bob Hope, Catherine Hepburn, Ernest Ward 9, Neil Rogers, Larry King, Johnny Cashmo, Howard Davided

[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.020]
Art Link Letter, Trout and Heston, Moreno Hara, or Jeff High, aka

[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:11.760]
Fatboy

[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.620]
Well, since we're doing people in the building, we got a lot of fat people in the building that might belong on here

[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:19.100]
Yeah, but most of the fat people in the building aren't old enough to be that ready

[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:23.900]
I mean, I realized that isn't always a, you know, criterion, but how about Hank?

[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.380]
Well, why do you want to put a Hank on it?

[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.540]
It's so odd, okay.

[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.080]
How about the Shady 2 Guest for the day at Hank?

[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.320]
I think there's something going on that we don't know about.

[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.960]
The Shady 2, George?

[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:33.880]
I took a Shady at Hank?

[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.220]
Well, by accident, I think he even took it at Mandage.

[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.180]
Oh, yeah, that's right about him.

[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:38.280]

[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.320]
I'm making some comment about Grace Kelly.

[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.900]
Yeah, no, I was confused.

[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.260]
Yeah, you were very confused.

[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.560]
You're just way off this week.

[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.500]
I'm going to read that facts again and start agreeing with it.

[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.400]
I think I could make some really good points at the lengthy facts that I read before.

[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.060]
In fact, reading it again will kill some really good time.

[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.800]
9.53, 5.67, 05.60, 05.60, only 18.

[00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:58.780]
And he don't forget its Wednesday.

[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.300]
Means our big noon to one hour is coming up.

[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.040]
All comedy bits.

[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.480]
Which we will take requests for that by the way, by notice that they've been very kind and generally.

[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.540]
Once in a while we get somebody who will fax one in here and there.

[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.880]
And that's okay, because I think I usually use very good, if you ask me.

[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:11.420]
George?

[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:11.860]
George, man.

[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.180]
Here's Opalaka.

[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:14.660]

[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.840]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:16.380]
Great.

[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.180]
I got a couple suggestions for your poll.

[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:19.860]
Okay.

[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.260]
Not that I hope it doesn't happen because I like them, but I think it's like 86.

[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.380]
It's Rodney Dangerfield.

[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.400]
Okay, he's on the edge.

[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.860]
And how about...

[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.660]
People like Rosanna Ben Laden?

[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.320]
Can you say that?

[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.880]
No, no, no, no. He's not a celebrity.

[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.020]
He's just a scumbag now.

[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.920]
Okay, then I was going to take you out to Johnny Cash.

[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.920]
So I guess that's it then.

[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:41.820]
Okay, so thank you.

[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.300]
One out of three in bed or two out of three.

[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:43.840]
Whatever you got.

[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.280]
Rodney Dangerfield.

[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.860]
In fact, remember the story in the Attabloids when we were doing Attabloids Tuesday sometime back?

[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:49.420]
Mm-hmm.

[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.780]
About how he was smoking up big fat ones in a hospital while he was in here from right on the edge.

[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.060]
He was right on the edge of death and he was smoking big fat ones.

[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:56.600]
He's a pip.

[00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.280]
Five, six.

[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:04.680]
And fact, I told you that time at the MGM Grand in Vegas when I saw him in a little cart.

[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.180]
You know, there's little carts like golf carts they had that you drive around, whip around real fast.

[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:15.080]
They hit him on one of those and they let him use because I guess just in order not to be bothered by people.

[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.460]
And he was just whipping up and down the hallways and up to the elevator and whatever else.

[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.060]
That was him.

[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:21.820]
Okay, I got a question.

[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:22.820]
And you're not impressed.

[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.600]
Yes, no, is the Pope a celebrity?

[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.040]
I would say so.

[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:27.900]
I would say so.

[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.140]
I would say he's a major celebrity and I...

[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:35.640]
And you know, I actually even liked that suggestion he had to give us out of 72 hours to cut the crap to go into a asylum.

[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.460]
I thought that was a pretty good plan they had at the Vatican.

[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:38.960]
Yeah, but he won't do that.

[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:47.320]
And then they also said the Swiss guard are getting a little old and the Pope said that if you also promise to send all the cute young rackies here for a altar boy work.

[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.360]
Remember that?

[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:49.900]
No.

[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.300]
Wasn't that part of the deal yet?

[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:56.140]
72 hours to go into a asylum and also put the Pope and his followers into a asylum.

[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.340]
I think it was like that.

[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:03.640]
No, it's sure as how beat this crazy war that W is getting ready to whip up here now and the public is just, you know, it's interesting.

[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.660]
You look at the polls and I don't want to even get into this thing because what's the point?

[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:13.540]
But you watch the polls around the rest of the world and almost every goddamn country 80, 90% and the polls are going more and more that direction.

[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.920]
There's no need for war at this time.

[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.440]
A record had nothing to do with 9-11.

[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:22.240]
And in this country now because the public is so easily lit, oh, they're getting impatient with the UN.

[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:27.440]
And we got to go in there. We got to do this and he gassed his own people and he, oh, please.

[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.300]
Talk about monkey, see monkey, do talk about a bunch of lemons.

[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.360]
How fast can we jump over that cliff?

[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.000]
You know, just tell us how fast to jump and we'll give it our best shot.

[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:38.620]
God.

[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:45.540]
You can never complain about the intelligence of the American public like collectively because it's scary.

[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:46.620]
It's a scary.

[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:52.920]
9-50. How did I get out of that when we're having such a nice wonderful time talking about dead people?

[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.860]
Four minutes till 10 to QM. Now what's on the agenda?

[00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:59.220]
They know ball games and crap. I sure hope not to later on.

[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.760]
Mad dogs on it one.

[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.240]
Thanks on three to seven a whole four hours in a studio where you can defend yourself against your intembrate comments.

[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:12.560]
Chico Panther people at seven because the Panthers host the Montreal Canadiens at the Macarena 7-30 tonight.

[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.280]
Eddie K from GA after the hockey game in Jo and Mark overnight.

[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.700]
Nice pristine schedule with the hockey game thrown in between.

[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.620]
Dougy Gilmore and Phil Howesley would leave now.

[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.100]
What do you say?

[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:26.500]
I also heard that we're bringing back Tim Horton and Alan Stanley.

[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.200]
Hey homeowners out there.

[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.740]
There's anything worth venturing out of the backyard to get a nice refreshing swim in a hot,

[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.880]
self-resouffle or today.

[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:37.180]
Looking at that once beautiful pristine pool of yours and saying, holy crap.

[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:37.720]
Oh my god.

[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.920]
What the hell happened here?

[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:39.840]
It's stained.

[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:40.340]
It's dirty.

[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.860]
It might be cracking in the pool too.

[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.620]
But you don't have to look at that mess anymore.

[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:47.940]
Just say no mo ugly pool and call our good pizons at Atlantic Marseille.

[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:52.240]
These guys are the couple of pool guys who sit in the pickup truck and went on a cleaning service.

[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.540]
Diamond Bright do it right because Diamond Bright's a pool's best friend.

[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.920]
Diamond Bright in local time.

[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.540]
Here's Sports Video 560, she'll be a UAM.

[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.280]
You got me.

[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:50.000]
He's an American music icon, the original country punk.

[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.920]
And now he's reaching across the Atlantic to pay tribute to England's greatest punk band.

[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.880]
It's the best of Johnny Clash.

[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.660]
Busy-reave, don't like him.

[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.720]
Flocking the Casbah.

[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:11.860]
A man in black is back on track with a very special version of Train in Bane.

[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.460]
Did you stand by me?

[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.860]
No, not at all.

[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.080]
Did you stand by me?

[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.220]
No way.

[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:26.080]
Yes, London's calling and they're saying hello to the best of Johnny Clash.

[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:29.020]
If I go there will be trouble.

[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.540]
And if I stay it will be double.

[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.380]
Hello, this is Johnny Clash.

[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.140]
And I shot this commercial in Reno just to watch you buy.

[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.920]
My brand new record.

[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.920]
So you've got to let me know.

[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.300]
Should I stay or should I go?

[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.020]
The best of Johnny Clash.

[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.500]
Look for it in the Combat Country section of your local record store.

[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.220]
Hey, Johnny.

[00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:58.780]
Hey, Johnny.

[00:35:59.060 --> 00:35:59.860]
Bye, bye, bye.

[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:00.900]
Yeah, he's on the way out.

[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.980]
And he's taking a long road home, you know what I'm saying?

[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.320]
Yeah, the slow, long road home.

[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.160]
I hear that train of color.

[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.120]
Paul Harvey's got to be on his way out.

[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.700]
Says Dan and we got him on there.

[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:16.160]
And Carlos, I think we're going to add some others because I noticed their votes are pouring in on there.

[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.920]
But we only got like five names, the original four or five or six, whatever.

[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.400]
I want to be pushing.

[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:21.840]
I already sent the last group to Eric.

[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:22.860]
Who's sick by the way.

[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.840]
Yeah, I feel better Eric, but get with it.

[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.900]
I emailed them the last group at the beginning of the break.

[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.780]
So feel a lot better real soon, Eric, but get with it.

[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.880]
No excuses, okay?

[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.140]
No slack and off.

[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:36.740]
Anyway, let's see.

[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.960]
Hank Goldberg Rodney Danger Field, the Pope David Brinkley somebody while somebody headed on here.

[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:41.600]
They didn't know the name.

[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.300]
The news guy who just about burned up in his house.

[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.300]
Poor David Brinkley is 82 and he's bedridden and he's in Lala land.

[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.660]
I guess he's got Alzheimer's.

[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:48.920]
Okay.

[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.160]
Very sad.

[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:55.840]
The first thing we had about David was when his eyeballs started falling out of their sockets right on ABC news.

[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.740]
Of course, you never watched that show this week with David Brinkley.

[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.140]
No, I'm going to start it.

[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.000]
It's following the W.A.K. you knew that there was real service there.

[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.060]
I'm serious.

[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.940]
And he probably still I still think he ate too much of that phony food that they make at Archudangels Midland.

[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.900]
So anyway, David Brinkley is on air.

[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.080]
Robert Blake somebody says which is a very good.

[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.560]
Did you see him at all?

[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.480]
Have you been watching the hearings?

[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.380]
A little bit.

[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:24.140]
My God, he looks like he's undergoing chemo and he's in bad shape.

[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.580]
His hair is like a skinhead now.

[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.420]
He's in bad shape.

[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.160]
And just because of that miserable bitch, I'm on your side on that now.

[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.020]
I don't agree with too much you say because you're usually wrong.

[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.200]
But on this one, I think you're right on top of it.

[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.940]
That bitch had it coming.

[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:42.460]
We ought to give him a gold medal, a purple star now, a purple jelly bean.

[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.320]
Or at least a bottle of shoe polish.

[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.460]
How much are you watching?

[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.580]
That's where you already die.

[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.480]
A bottle of shoe polish, yeah, they do the Ronnie Reagan on that hair.

[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.120]
Well, it's not going to look good if this thing goes to trial.

[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.760]
He has to be in court looking like that.

[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.920]
No, poor guy.

[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:55.680]
Let's see.

[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.080]
I'll read the whole list on.

[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:06.020]
I miss Ronald Reagan's or a Lewis Bob Hope, Katherine Hepburn or his Vorgine, Neil Rogers, Larry King, Johnny Cash, Mohari David, our link letter, Charlton Heston, Marino Ahera.

[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:07.720]
Oh, that's right.

[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:08.340]
He even wrote down.

[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.300]
He put Marino Ahera, not a hair.

[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:11.200]
God.

[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.240]
Isn't it?

[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.140]
Yeah.

[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:22.320]
Jeff High, a.k.a. Fatboy, Hank Goldberg, Rodney Dangerfield, the Pope, David Brinkley, Robert Blake and Paul Harvey.

[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.560]
Now, isn't this poll a little bit insensitive?

[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.380]
No, it's really happened.

[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.960]
I'm just saying that because somebody will certainly call and say, nah, you've lost touch with the air.

[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.840]
We're not hoping for anybody to die.

[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.180]
We wish everybody would live forever.

[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.100]
Almost everybody.

[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.600]
But it just happens.

[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.240]
These dirt naps come along and it's just one of those things.

[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:48.240]
Five, six, it's just as inevitable as Greg Reid going to make another screw up in our lineup on these days.

[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.940]
As a matter of fact, Mo was talking about one way that we could help my ratings again.

[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:53.760]
He's talking about the billboards.

[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:54.940]
I got another better way.

[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:55.660]
You know how to do that?

[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:56.040]
How?

[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.420]
With a great lead-in.

[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.500]
Here's Sonny Isles.

[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:00.720]
Hello.

[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:02.060]
Hello, Neil.

[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:02.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.700]
Yeah, I got two for you.

[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:05.400]
Okay.

[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.380]
But you know what, George is great.

[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.360]
You are great.

[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:14.520]
And Evan, what all the problem is with all this ridiculous problem with what?

[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.860]
Well, I mean, the people are complaining about George.

[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.220]
He's great.

[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.720]
People are always complaining about everything.

[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.400]
That's the nature of main plants.

[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.540]
And that's the nature of the beacon, especially in South Florida.

[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.920]
I don't say it's the nature of the beast.

[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.500]
The beast got no problems.

[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.580]
It's going to baggage already.

[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.400]
No, but what about Billy Graham?

[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:35.980]
Oh, yeah. He's hanging on.

[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:39.460]
He is, I mean, he just knows the tolls on the other night.

[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.200]
If I was him, I'd be seeing a lot of extra prayers, you know.

[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.280]
And how about the last of the rat pack?

[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.660]
Joey Bishop.

[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:48.560]
There you go.

[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:49.860]
Is he still alive?

[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:50.500]
I guess he is.

[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:50.680]
Yes.

[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:51.840]
He's 86.

[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.300]
He's hanging in there.

[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:55.580]
He's hanging by a thread.

[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:56.380]
Okay. Thanks, Pally.

[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.260]
All right.

[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.020]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.660]
Have a great life.

[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.820]
Joey Bishop and Billy Graham, two great choices there.

[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.260]
I mean, you know, and then I wish we had a prize.

[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.760]
Wouldn't that be great if we had a policy?

[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.260]
That would not be good, you know.

[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.820]
Of course, if I croak, you don't want to be given up no prizes for that.

[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.040]
But it would be something like take up an office pool.

[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.680]
People speculate on these things all the time.

[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:17.920]

[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.160]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.020]
pound 5, 60 on the AT in the early running.

[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.800]
Bob Hope and Ronnie Reagan are pulling away.

[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.920]
But that's still only with his first few on air.

[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.680]
97 votes already.

[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:35.880]
But Eric, once he gets out of bed and takes a nice sip of herb tea

[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.800]
and crawls over to his computer, he'll get these other ones on air.

[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:39.180]
I'm sure.

[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.020]
Aren't you sure, Carlos?

[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.200]
Yeah.

[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.800]
Bob Hope 53, Ronald Reagan 31.

[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.400]
Which, who do you think will be the next celebrity?

[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.400]
And we say celebrity, just a famous person.

[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.820]
You know, there's nothing like a movie star.

[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.620]
The Pope ain't no movie star, neither am I.

[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.240]
Bob Hope 53, Ronald Reagan 31.

[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.180]
Jerry Lewis 7.

[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.560]
I'm a 5 Catherine Hepburn 1 Ernest Borg-Nine.

[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:00.740]
None.

[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:05.440]
And the rest of them were still hanging here in suspense waiting for the other ones to go up on the list.

[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.600]
See, it's not very exciting when there's a list of only three six or seven names.

[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.260]
Follow what I'm saying.

[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.200]
It's not very, uh, simple-ating.

[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.600]
It's not titillating if I can say that.

[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.140]
Can I say it?

[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:15.260]
No.

[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.680]
So, anyway, the locations of our billboards are...

[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.300]
We got four of them, by the way, Mo.

[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.420]
We got four billboards because they realized that they only had at least that for instance,

[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.400]
screwed up my time since you were a dodging old man.

[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.300]
It can only do three hours instead of six to ten like everybody else in the world does.

[00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:32.800]
And also, uh, bad leading.

[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.220]
So, the least they can do is give us four billboards to try to get back the audience that you helped to blow out.

[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:38.380]
Thanks a lot, Mo.

[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.720]
I think he was involved.

[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.440]
He was up his sleeve, that fact.

[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.500]
Sharpen up your shift, man.

[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:47.920]
Get a real nice and sharp.

[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.180]
Like a spear, like a sword.

[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.540]
Here's a lady in Miami Beach.

[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:53.800]
Hello.

[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:55.340]
Hello.

[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:56.580]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.260]
How you doing?

[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:58.020]
Okay.

[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.180]
Hey, I hope I hope you're ratings.

[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.380]
My friend told me about you and it's my first ten listening.

[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:03.020]
Yeah.

[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.500]
And I'm already hooked, but I'd like to add to the list, uh,

[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:06.040]
I'm going right.

[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.280]
Marlon Brando.

[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.520]
Marlon Brando.

[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.100]
And by the way, he was on the front of it.

[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.440]
Did you see the tabloid where they said he was like 380 pounds?

[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.060]
Yeah, poor guy.

[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.540]
I mean, I don't mean to have some rating, but I think he's right on the edge.

[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.800]
He might just blow up, you know, he might just burst.

[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:21.960]
Yeah.

[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:23.620]
That's a lot.

[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:24.800]
Thanks a lot, sweetheart.

[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:25.460]
Have a great day.

[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:26.560]
All right, you too.

[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:26.920]
Welcome.

[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.800]
Okay, there's a new list of that's two this way.

[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:29.520]
Oh, no.

[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:33.260]
First, then we have the ex-lister that hates George that sent that letter to Greg Reed.

[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.920]
I'm going to go to Greg Reed.

[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.000]
Aren't you impressed by that?

[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.620]
You saved that, saved a copy of that.

[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:40.060]
Oh, yes.

[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:40.920]
I've factored to you.

[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:41.760]
It's a frame.

[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.960]
I put that in my diary.

[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.960]
I put that in my employee file.

[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.200]
You know how they're always like to stick this stuff in our file?

[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.300]
I put that in there.

[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.440]
I put it in my crap book.

[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.020]
So that next time that they try to screw you over, and next time I get a call up here,

[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.620]
I've decided to terminate George Reed Reed.

[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.460]
See, maybe most start on your ass again.

[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.120]
Maybe that's why we get all these cost of comments on his show about you again.

[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:00.940]
About that book.

[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:01.780]
Guava, huh?

[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:02.800]
That's a point.

[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.060]
About that little beener, George, your Rodriguez.

[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.140]
You know, it was good, close buddy.

[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:06.540]
Hello, George.

[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:07.120]
Yeah, right.

[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:07.820]
Oh, yes.

[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.040]
Start sucking around now, Mo.

[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:09.880]
You're not fooling anybody.

[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.280]
You're not fooling anybody.

[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.480]
You silly old coot with bad varicose vans and a smelly dripping bag.

[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:15.880]
Who are you, kiddin' man?

[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.640]
Only one suggestion I have for you that could improve your life, Mo.

[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.860]
Take off those checkered pants.

[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:22.760]
That's it.

[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:23.900]
He must have already known.

[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:26.200]
Silly old coot.

[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:34.180]
Oh, and so the word in New York was, I don't want to say what Florida team recently played a game in New York over the weekend, like the Panthers.

[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.020]
But the word in New York was, uh, yeah.

[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:43.740]
When his name came up in conversation, he sure was high maintenance when he was here in New York, aka.

[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:48.080]
In other words, oh my God, you know, he was sure high maintenance when he was here.

[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:52.340]
In other words, a real pain in the ass that can't get along with anybody.

[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.080]
So all my co-workers, they're a Q&A.

[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.080]
Don't take it personal.

[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.340]
It's not just us that you can't get along with.

[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.780]
It's anybody anywhere.

[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.880]
Because for some reason we just aren't on the same wavelength.

[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.420]
We just don't have the same hair piece.

[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.780]
There's just something there.

[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.300]
We just aren't on the same, in the same universe with the old Momeister.

[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:12.480]
Here's the Miami.

[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:12.800]
Hello.

[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:14.220]
Hello.

[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:15.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.360]
Yes, sir, or you've got to add alcohol.

[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.020]
You can get a list.

[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.020]
He's looking for a problem.

[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:20.240]
Al, who?

[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.360]
Al, go see.

[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.260]
Oh, I grew close personal friend.

[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:24.100]
Absolutely.

[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:25.600]
Out of sight, out of mind.

[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:26.580]
Absolutely.

[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.080]
And then his legal problems, I think he must be added quickly.

[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:30.760]
He's heading for demise.

[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.500]
Hey, was that you?

[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.660]
Was that Paul Harvey or Paul Harvey Jr.?

[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.620]
I won't make a comment.

[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:39.420]
I'll bite my tongue.

[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:40.140]
All right.

[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:41.040]
Thank you, sir.

[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:41.740]
Have a great day.

[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:42.600]
Al Goldstein.

[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.800]
Yeah, he's, although, you know, I don't, I don't think he's ever going to die.

[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.260]
But he's, no, seriously.

[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.820]
He's got the most amazing genes.

[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:50.940]
In fact, he's got two person together, I believe.

[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.720]
But I don't know how and how he does.

[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.300]
He's diabetic.

[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.600]
He weighs about 600 pounds.

[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.820]
He takes no care of himself.

[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:56.160]
Right.

[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:59.560]
He's in jail every other week now because everybody in the world is suing his ass.

[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:01.720]
George.

[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:02.800]
Yeah.

[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.520]
Well, let's say everyone that says, I wish you not, we're not, we're not suing you.

[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.620]
All is forgiven.

[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.960]
I wish it would have been in tanias to contribute to your pool.

[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:13.680]
If there's a more annoying song, then free bird by Leonard Skinner.

[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.620]
I haven't heard it slow ponderous on the Red Nucky National Anthem.

[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.140]
And though I never really mind the original Ghostbusters song,

[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.360]
be who you're going to call Maroon.

[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.180]
Jingle, oh, Maroonie.

[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:24.680]
Oh, I said, what's that got to do?

[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.300]
That's not, that's one of our fine sponsors.

[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:27.960]
Who you're going to call Maroonie?

[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.580]
Don't be picking on our good friends.

[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.840]
By the way, Atlantic did a great job.

[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:32.780]
Oh, thank God.

[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.920]
Atlantic Marcy, I'm in the bright of my pool near a year ago.

[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:36.500]
Did a great job.

[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.680]
Thank you, sir, very much.

[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.240]
But don't be picking on Maroonie, even though you don't like their jingle.

[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:46.300]
Let's see, there must, the must on any celebrity death watch list include.

[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.980]
Mickey Rooney, is he still alive?

[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:48.520]
Yeah.

[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.360]
He pops up every now and again.

[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:51.120]
Yeah.

[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.180]
Poor little Mickey.

[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:53.420]
People keep stepping on him.

[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.400]
Gregory Peck.

[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:55.980]
Oh, he can't.

[00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:01.600]
He's got to be at least 110.

[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.200]
And Kirk Douglas, who stroked his way to Jingle.

[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.480]
If he can do it, I can do it too.

[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:10.200]
He wrote a book about that about his stroking about how his son about how Michael Douglas

[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.100]
pushed him up and made him like shake himself out of it.

[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.420]
Here's another one that says Kirk Douglas.

[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:15.740]
And also Rosemary.

[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.440]
Rosemary can't still be alive.

[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:18.000]
Don't know.

[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.800]
From Dick Van Dyke and the Hollywood, Hollywood squares.

[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.860]
I'll put these down, but Carlos, when you look him up, if any of you are in our date, I'll cross him out.

[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:25.960]

[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:25.960]

[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:25.960]

[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:25.960]

[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:25.960]

[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:25.960]

[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:25.960]

[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.080]
How are we doing on this pool now?

[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:27.420]
We got some fun.

[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.200]
I need a little more for the Rosemary.

[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.020]
What do you mean by that?

[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.060]
Is that her name?

[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:33.100]
Rosemary.

[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:33.820]

[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:34.420]
Rosemary.

[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:35.140]
That's her name.

[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.340]
She doesn't have a last name.

[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:37.980]
Rosemary, you little punk.

[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.220]
You don't know from Rosemary?

[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.900]
By the way, I still see the same six up there.

[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.820]
Are you sure that Eric didn't beat us all to the punch?

[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:46.120]
I can kill himself.

[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.360]
He might kill himself.

[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.880]
Probably one more of those breakfast burritos, man.

[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.380]
That'll do it.

[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.000]
Quit the eating.

[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:53.640]
Eric, you fat, cup of crap.

[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.380]
I wonder he's sick.

[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:54.800]
That's right.

[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:55.340]
They're my Eric.

[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.120]
So I guess it'll be up to you to get the other names on our website.

[00:46:58.540 --> 00:46:59.820]
Schmuck, he doesn't have control over that.

[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.820]
Nearodgers.com, that's our website.

[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.160]
For all the new listener, we got both them.

[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:07.180]
1013 is 560 QA.M. Hey, if you want your carpets looking just like brand new.

[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:11.360]
Maybe if you have pets like I've had, they've made your carpets looking smell and feel really crappy,

[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:12.540]
literally and figuratively.

[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:13.500]
Here's the answer.

[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.800]
Our good, close, personal friends at dry concepts.

[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.760]
I've used them in my house over 20 years.

[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.480]
Everybody I know, my relatives, my enemies, my friends.

[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.240]
Everybody uses them because they're the best.

[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.480]
Nobody else in the world dry cleans your carpets.

[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:25.760]
It's the same kind of deal.

[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.560]
It's used to dry clean your clothing and it works.

[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:31.280]
They suck out even the deep-down dirt and the fibers of your carpeting which leaves them

[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.840]
looking and smelling just like brand new.

[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.040]
They smell em and he fresh.

[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.680]
They dry in a couple of hours and you'll be just shocked.

[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.440]
Your carpets look just like brand new's been laid on your floor and there's nothing like

[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.380]
it in the laid on your floor.

[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.740]
And also, of course, they do is to finish job within your upholstery by the furniture,

[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.380]
your expensive area rugs, the same great job for you.

[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:50.340]
And if you have a problem with pet orders and mildewaters, because by water damage,

[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:54.640]
no problem, they'll wave their magic wand, do this spectacular work and make them look just like brand new.

[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:55.520]
And here's the deal.

[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.860]
They give you a written guaranteed price upfront before they start the work.

[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:03.420]
No one hitting charges, no tack ons at the end, no bad surprises, just a big smile on your push.

[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.640]
They give it a little rose at the end of the job you hand them a check and everybody's happy.

[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.640]
Do yourself a big favor, call them once.

[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.180]
You'll never have to call anybody else again.

My life and law, this is 43516, the way you can weigh.

[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:36.580]
It's day 40 Miami Town at 560 WQA.

[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:41.500]
Hello!

[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:43.460]
Hello!

[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:44.440]
Hello!

[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:44.740]

[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:45.120]
How are you?

[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.920]
Who is this the maid?

[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.320]
No, this is your wife, Talia.

[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.760]
I like to speak with Tommy Metolia.

[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:54.600]
Hello!

[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:55.860]
Tommy Motto, the resident.

[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:56.600]
Prah!

[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:57.880]
What's going on?

[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:58.500]
Chiro?

[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.440]
No, no, Talia.

[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.360]
Talia, let me talk to the devil.

[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.180]
Please hold.

[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.100]
Tommy!

[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.240]
Tommy!

[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:06.960]
Yes!

[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:08.080]
Prah!

[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.220]
What is this?

[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:11.720]
You got the phone!

[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:12.540]
Oh.

[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:13.240]
Oh.

[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:14.600]
Hello!

[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.960]
Tommy Metolia speaking.

[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.180]
This is Michael Jackson.

[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.500]
You lost your job.

[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.040]
You lost your job.

[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:23.780]
Hey, I didn't lose my job.

[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.260]
I stepped down.

[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:25.760]
Oh, sure.

[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:31.540]
However you want to paint the picture, whatever you have to tell yourself in order to save some sort of face you do it.

[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:32.960]
But you lost your job.

[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.440]
You know, actually, it's kind of nice to hear your voice.

[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.080]
What?

[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.260]
It's kind of nice to hear anybody's voice.

[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:40.800]
What are you talking about?

[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.480]
Michael Jackson!

[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.540]
Yeah, can you hear that?

[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.140]
That's my Mexican wife, let me tell you.

[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.700]
It was cute for maybe five, ten minutes a day.

[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:53.360]
But if I got to stay home with her every day, I'm going to go crazy.

[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.420]
You're getting your just desserts.

[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.440]
Tommy Metolia, that devil.

[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:00.980]
All we do is eat Mexican food.

[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.180]
Jimmy Chungas, burritos, tostitos.

[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.640]
I got more gas than exonc.

[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.340]
And you deserve to have the bloat.

[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.980]
Listen, Michael, I'll resurface somewhere.

[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.600]
I'll start another label.

[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:15.320]
Sure you will.

[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.940]
So you can destroy the career of other budding artists.

[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.940]
Are we going to Chevy?

[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.560]
Yes, Tommy.

[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:23.660]
We're going to Chevy.

[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.660]
Thank you very much.

[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:25.180]
All right.

[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.500]
Oh, jeez.

[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:28.680]
If it's not Chevy, it's T-keys.

[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.340]
If it's not G-keys, it's...

[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.660]
What's that drive in place?

[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.500]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.160]
I called to be Ray Chu.

[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:40.540]
And all I'm getting is dribble and Jimmy Changa.

[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:40.820]
Ooh.

[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.100]
Admit it.

[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:46.460]
I was the reason you were forced to be fired.

[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:47.460]
Right, I know.

[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:50.160]
Because I'm very, very, very devilish.

[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:51.560]
Ah, ooh.

[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.380]
I was delivered in America.

[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.060]
I was delivered in America.

[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.300]
You're delivered in America.

[00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.040]
All right.

[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:57.960]
Hey, look, Mikey.

[00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:58.640]
I got to go.

[00:50:58.820 --> 00:50:58.980]
Okay.

[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.900]
I got to take it over to Taco Bell.

[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:01.900]
Debbie.

[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:02.680]
Okay.

[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.440]
Chevy, you want to come with us?

[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.520]
No, I don't want to be seen with you.

[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.680]
You are the devil.

[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:12.140]
So at this point, I am finding myself having some sympathy for you.

[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:12.780]
Mm-hmm.

[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:14.920]
All right, all right.

[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:15.300]
All right.

[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:16.900]
I got to go there, Mikey.

[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.040]
Let me tell you something.

[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.720]
If I were to fart right now,

[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.440]
half the neighborhood would go up.

[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:21.980]
Ooh.

[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:22.920]
Stop.

[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.320]
If I...

[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:24.620]
Yeah.

[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:28.000]
10.21 at 5.60.

[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.420]
I'm not sure whether I like that one better or the Eisner one, you know?

[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:31.400]
Hmm.

[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:32.220]
Huh?

[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.380]
It's a tough call, man.

[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.560]
In fact, that'll be another pull.

[00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:59.060]
Eisner?

[00:51:59.320 --> 00:51:59.920]
Yeah.

[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.580]
It's all Talia though.

[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:03.660]
She's what makes it like it.

[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:06.820]
And nobody else has got any yet because they just went up on her.

[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:07.380]
Carlos.

[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:08.980]
God.

[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:10.460]
And we've added to our list, let's see.

[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.340]
Al Goldstein, I was right after Marlon Brando.

[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:13.680]
Mickey Rooney, Gregory Peck.

[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.240]
Now, did you look these up to make sure they're alive?

[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:16.480]
Yep.

[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:17.040]
They're all good.

[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:17.680]
They're all alive.

[00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:18.560]
They're all alive?

[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:19.080]
Yes, sir.

[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.320]
Gregory's Peck?

[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:21.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:21.660]
Wow.

[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.580]
And Kirk Douglas, we know he's still alive because he's bragging about his stroke.

[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.000]
Rosemary, would you not even know who now that is?

[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:27.940]
I'm ashamed of you.

[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:28.320]
I do know.

[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:32.480]
She was on a Hollywood squares and she was on the Dick Van Dyke show.

[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.100]
Underlined the Dyke part in her case, Rosemary.

[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:39.860]
She was like a professional game show panelist person after she was on the Dick Van Dyke show.

[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:41.900]
Keith Richards, somebody says.

[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:43.980]
Okay.

[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:45.060]
Axel Rose.

[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:47.700]
See, I think they're thinking about drugs now.

[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:48.760]
They're thinking of heavy-duty drugs.

[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:50.980]
Red hour Bach and Bob Dylan.

[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:55.560]
See, Red hour Bach, George don't even know who that is because he's the former longtime coach of the Boston Celtics and General Manager.

[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:59.240]
And he always puffs on a big cigar and he must have good genes too because he's 140 years old.

[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.880]
Right, our Bach, nobody knows who that is.

[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:01.760]
And Bob Dylan.

[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:05.040]
He's still wine and away, man. He's still wine and not.

[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:09.300]
As a matter of fact, wouldn't it be a good time for him to start right up a whole bunch of protest songs?

[00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:10.680]
Are we putting all of those on there?

[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:14.400]
Yeah, I'm reading you from my list that I've compiled here.

[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.900]
Mr. Confirmin, you better start catching up.

[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.400]
You guys are like, they late in the dollar short.

[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.240]
We only have a short show today because it's our Wednesday noon.

[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:23.380]
I know.

[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:29.220]
And all those new listener of ours that we've got, they're going to be shocked that on Wednesday we play solid-cannon.

[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:34.840]
It's from noon to one every week because it is hump day with some very corny assholes say that hump day which we find disgusting.

[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:41.840]
But nevertheless, it's the middle of the week and what better thing to do especially during these distressing horrendous duct-haired filled times,

[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.500]
then give you a few little truckles.

[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:44.780]
Okay.

[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:49.100]
You know, the fact that Hatesme had left the number we could have called them and told them that I'm not going to be talking that hour.

[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:51.920]
Yeah, that's a good point.

[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:54.660]
Well, just to piss them off, mumble a few things.

[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.360]
Oh, I'll tell you the energy in South Florida in negativity.

[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:06.800]
They could put as much energy into positive things as they put into negativity and extending their hostility.

[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:10.160]
You know, that thing that they do so well and so often and so much.

[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.260]
We could light up the world if you could bottle that somehow.

[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:12.700]
Exactly.

[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.160]
It could be a terrific place.

[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:14.800]
There's another one.

[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:16.820]
I'd like to teach the world.

[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:17.800]
I should have been on there yesterday.

[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.520]
Was that the speakers and the new seekers?

[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:20.200]
I don't know.

[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:22.800]
I'd like to teach the world a stink man.

[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.900]
That song just drove me.

[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.960]
It was okay to first 6,000 times.

[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:29.080]
But good, Golly, talk about corn balls.

[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:32.440]
Here's a call from Coconut Grove where they know their balls.

[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:32.760]
Hello.

[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:34.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:35.220]
Yes.

[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:40.240]
You forgot all the political strong thermon, Papa Bush, Gerald Ford.

[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:41.640]
Wait a minute.

[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:42.420]
Slow down.

[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:43.020]
Slow down.

[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:43.400]
Wait a minute.

[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:44.860]
Strong thermon is a good one.

[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:46.920]
Yeah, Papa Bush.

[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.000]
Papa Bush.

[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.300]
Gerald Ford.

[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:50.320]
Right.

[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.060]
And the peanut guy, Jimmy Carter.

[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:53.620]
Jimmy Carter?

[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:54.760]
Oh, he ain't got that.

[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:55.460]
I can't.

[00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:58.940]
They only wish up here.

[00:54:59.020 --> 00:54:59.740]
You have no idea.

[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:01.620]
Yeah, and Vibli can idea.

[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:03.160]
Okay.

[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:04.140]
Alrighty.

[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:05.260]
Are we the durch?

[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:06.020]
How are you?

[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:06.860]
Durch.

[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:08.200]
Okay, Jimmy Carter.

[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:09.420]
Well, I tell you there's so many.

[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:12.140]
I know there's a lot of people just hanging by a thread hanging on the edge.

[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.380]
I can start relating to it, man.

[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.320]
I can start.

[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.260]
I'm getting very close.

[00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.740]
A lot closer to the end in the beginning as they say.

[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:20.340]
Who said that that was William Holden in the network, remember that?

[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:20.640]
Right.

[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:25.480]
How do you spell Critschink when she talked about getting his winter passion or his daughter is doding?

[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.900]
Or the other one, I don't know what it was.

[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:27.500]
His daughter?

[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.680]
John J.E.A.N.

[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:33.540]
John Critschin, C-H-R-E-T-I-E-N,

[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:37.460]
As in Frog, where they talk out of the corner of his mouth.

[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:38.460]
But I'll tell you one thing.

[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:39.740]
He makes a lot of sense to me lately.

[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:42.940]
How'd you like that interview we had over the weekend on ABC?

[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:47.140]
Did the djord with a little squeaker or a djord step on top of us?

[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:49.300]
And he basically said, hey, the war is over.

[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.080]
You don't have to fight anybody.

[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:51.000]
You won, W.

[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:51.940]
You won. It's all over.

[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:55.740]
And they're trying to figure out what he was talking about.

[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.320]
You won. You don't have to fight no war.

[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.220]
He is, they hate him.

[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:04.940]
And I don't understand because every time he's run, he wins by this humongous amount, this gigantic margin.

[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.760]
But they just despise him in all the newspapers.

[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:08.360]
They had tutorials.

[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.920]
They just rip him an ass.

[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.520]
You almost think he was like kind to W.

[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.120]
And don't forget, remember what his aides were saying?

[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:19.060]
Every time you turn around, it was another major conflict times.

[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:22.800]
Another big scandal because what a John Cretch N comments was called our president.

[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:24.440]
M-O-R-O-N.

[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:26.240]
And in America, we can't relate well to the truth.

[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:26.900]
We don't like that.

[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.920]
We like to do a sugar coat, you know?

[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.600]
And don't forget about Sada, man.

[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.320]
He drank water out of a creek.

[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.420]
Or was that the other guy?

[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.400]
Tell me, tell me.

[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:38.780]
You're missing the whole point.

[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:40.640]
That guy in the fax is right about you, George.

[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:42.040]
You're a little bit too slow for this kid.

[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:43.000]
What?

[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:43.900]
That's my point.

[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.160]
He gassed his own people.

[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.760]
He drank water out of a creek.

[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:48.140]
I mean, just all these things.

[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.180]
Oops, he's dead.

[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:51.820]
We can only hope the same for Sada.

[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:53.400]
Wouldn't it be great if he would die next?

[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:54.540]
Yeah.

[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:56.400]
And save us all of that grief in the trouble and so on.

[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:59.360]
Of course, we'll make a little more difficult to our hose up to those oil wells, but nevertheless.

[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:04.400]
And you know what we're saying is that we're going to make sure that the Iraqi people get that oil.

[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.220]
Have you noticed that?

[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.040]
Right.

[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:08.160]
So they can rebuild their input.

[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:11.100]
Because now we're very concerned about those poor oppressed Iraqi people.

[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:14.540]
We didn't give a flying crap about the Iraqi people before 9-11.

[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.200]
In fact, we didn't give a crap about them until long after that until they finally decided

[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:21.520]
well, we can't find Osama Yamama, but we know where Sodom's got an address.

[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.940]
Some over there, it's in the bag, Dad.

[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:26.620]
That's what W. told Herbert Walker.

[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:28.220]
It's in the bag, Dad.

[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:30.880]
I think he's in the bag again.

[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:31.440]
It's the problem.

[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:36.980]
In fact, if you read our bedtime stories today, there's one in particular that's just eight pages long, a scathing.

[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:40.220]
A scathing attack on your president, Carlos.

[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.200]
1027 at 560 W.

[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:46.800]
Let me tell you about a great place, the world famous pizza lot.

[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.360]
Two locations for now, they're Browards' most popular.

[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:54.340]
They're in a plantation right at the corner of Sunrise and Nabil right behind the...

[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:55.300]
What is that place? Walgreens.

[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.180]
Right on the corner there.

[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:57.400]
You can't see him from the streets.

[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:00.360]
I'll be sure and drive in the shopping center and say, hey, there's the freaking pizza lot.

[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.220]
And of course, the original Broward locations in Davy, no less.

[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.500]
I'm university drive right behind Pier 1 in Forth, between Givin and 595.

[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:10.540]
Kitty corner, the Armandolo Cafe, with loads and loads and tons of free parking there.

[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.220]
And the food is sensational.

[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:15.420]
It's fresh. It's delicious. Everybody loves the pizza lot.

[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:17.220]
Especially the rimmers who eat there a lot for free.

[00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:18.780]
And our gold scene who also eats for free.

[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.380]
So the rest of you, please go there and pay and believe me, you won't mind.

[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:24.060]
Because the prices are tiny and the portions are gigantic.

[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:27.120]
You probably have to take a lot of home and a lot of stuff home in a doggy bag.

[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:32.400]
In fact, I can imagine what are the neighbors there by the pizza lot and Davy probably taking tons of food home in doggy bags every day.

[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:33.360]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:33.720]
No.

[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:34.580]
I'm sure you do.

[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.400]
Every Monday's lasagna night at the log.

[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.500]
I'll be Tuesday's eggplant night.

[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.620]
I'll be one of these dinners on these nights.

[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:40.900]
Get the second for only five bucks.

[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.180]
Wednesday, kids eat feed with adult second come and see Jeff's famous magic show.

[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:45.740]
Thursday is bite night at the pizza lot.

[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.600]
Come on a motorcycle by one dinner. Get the second one for half price.

[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:49.460]
And they got it all.

[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:50.740]
They got three different kinds of great pizza.

[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:52.940]
The most incredible garlic rules you ever popped in your mouth.

[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.820]
They got chicken and veal and seafood, kale, zone, super subs.

[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:56.880]
And lots more to it.

[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:01.380]
Like I said, gigantic portions of food is all cooked fresh to order and incredibly reasonable prices.

[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:03.600]
For take out delivery and catering in plantation.

[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.300]
Here's the number.

[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:06.380]
It's 954-382-1999.

[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:08.680]
382-1999.

[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:13.380]
And of course in the other joint in Davy called 954-916-8880.

[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:15.380]
954-916-8880.

[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:17.540]
Tell all Jeff Cohen and Neil said,

[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:19.300]
Hi and please don't ever call the show again.

[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.180]
My life and local.

[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:23.520]
This is 4405-60.

[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.300]
You may come way.

[00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:28.620]
I am on the hands.

[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:32.500]
It's idiots of hot week on the prices right.

[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:37.200]
What would you bid on that fine, on that fine oak cabinet?

[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:39.900]
Yeah, 694-12 cents.

[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:43.220]
Yeah, that definitely 694-12 cents.

[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:47.500]
Yeah. And the price is $694-12 cents.

[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:48.800]
You're a winner.

[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:51.800]
They may not know what year it is, but they know their prices.

[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.120]
And prices.

[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:55.420]
112 items that today show, yeah, yeah.

[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.140]
Yeah, that definitely 112 items that today show.

[00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:02.300]
Don't miss a second of idiots of hot week on the price is right.

[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.420]
What's the name of the guy first?

[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:03.680]

[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:04.440]
The guy first.

[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:05.680]
Who? The guy I'm first.

[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:07.180]
What's the name of the guy I'm first?

[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:08.720]
I don't know.

[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.220]
Who pays.

[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.480]
And what do you think about Bob Barker?

[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:12.460]
Right.

[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:13.300]
Huh?

[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.020]
Definitely.

[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:15.820]
That was just little inspiration for myself,

[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:16.820]
which is why I played that bit.

[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:18.160]
I just put Bob Barker on there.

[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:19.540]
They're just pouring in here on the list.

[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:20.240]
We'll never keep up.

[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.220]
Somebody said Johnny Carson.

[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.720]
There goes Johnny.

[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:25.240]
Ed McMahon.

[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.220]
Got it.

[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.140]
Got it.

[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:29.920]
Regis Filman.

[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.180]
I don't think I got it.

[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:32.840]
I said got it.

[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:33.660]
I don't want to do that anymore.

[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:34.440]
Got it.

[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.140]
You're going to get, and it is the 10 to 11 hour, which is when he's listening.

[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.860]
Even though he says he's a said goodbye to the show.

[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.220]
And by the way, if that asshole wrote the letter, is listening.

[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.380]
Bye, bye, bye.

[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:44.380]
Get lost, schmuck.

[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.560]
Even Greg Reed said he reputs.

[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:47.260]
And that's a lot.

[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:49.940]
When somebody like Greg Reed says he reputs, boy, that's about as low as you.

[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.420]
That's even lower than the barnacles on the bottom of the ship and the things that crawl around on the barnacles.

[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:56.340]
Somebody says, Regis, I don't think so.

[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.980]
Even though he didn't have that one heart attack and open heart surgery, all other stuff.

[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.740]
If he survived that bitch-cathy lead.

[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:02.400]
It's big now.

[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:03.300]
It's big in a boat.

[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:03.960]
Okay, Reg.

[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:04.860]
Larry Hagman.

[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.300]
He's a good one.

[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:06.840]
Larry Hagman.

[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.100]
I saw it on an interview the other day.

[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.240]
Larry Hagman.

[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:09.900]
Oh, no.

[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:10.480]
Oh, Larry.

[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:10.900]

[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:12.260]
From one of our favorite shows.

[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.500]
From two of us.

[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:14.240]
Well, I didn't like Dallas.

[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:17.240]
He was a good looking guy, by the way.

[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.400]
I'll tell you what it was.

[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:19.760]
I just tell you that.

[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:20.160]
Huh?

[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.400]
When he was on Genie, you then think Larry Hagman was a good guy.

[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.580]
I never knew that.

[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.440]
I was a little distracted when I was watching Genie.

[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:28.540]
Stop, stop, stop.

[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.060]
See, that's another excuse we did.

[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.720]
He was in a self-hating, a homo-spix.

[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:32.260]
Sure.

[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:33.780]
He was a good looking guy.

[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:35.220]
What do you say, whatever his name was?

[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:36.640]
I was in Roger Healey myself.

[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.120]
Is that what you were?

[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:39.340]
How about Glenn Healey?

[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.300]
How about Peter Ford and Mary Healey or whatever the hell their name was?

[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.620]
Regis Filman, somebody says Dick Cheney, of course.

[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:47.340]
I don't know.

[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.560]
No, we better not put that on there.

[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.440]
Okay, that's not a good idea.

[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:50.560]
Don't put it on there, Carla.

[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.240]
He see.

[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.080]
No, no, it's not just that.

[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.820]
We just don't need the secret service knocking at you.

[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:57.540]
You already got the customs people up here going to be knocking the door down.

[01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:59.520]
We don't need the secret service on their heels.

[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.840]
Magic Johnson, I don't think so.

[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:03.960]
I think he's got his big A under control, A.

[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:04.160]

[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:07.900]
And I think he's, let's see, we did put Johnny Carson in me and it went right.

[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:09.200]
Okay, the list is pouring in.

[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.900]
We got a lot of open lines though, all of a sudden now.

[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.220]
During that last break, maybe some of them died.

[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.760]
You know how impressionable these bastards are.

[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.380]
Maybe it was a sublimable message.

[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.280]
Don't forget it's Treasurer Islands 18th anniversary and a 7th magazine.

[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.120]
10th anniversary party this afternoon, a little bit later on.

[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.340]
Join Little George, their little relentless pick with a sharp knife.

[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:33.600]
Volkabrion, Miguel, Beener Boy and possibly the Beast at Treasurer Island.

[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:37.480]
From 5 to 7 this afternoon, located off the Paul Metter just north of the 122nd

[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:37.820]
street exit.

[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.700]
You win great QA and prizes, right?

[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:46.940]
And really some other really good prizes, like like a $500 like $500 in cash, bar tabs, t-shirts, and all.

[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:47.160]
Right.

[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:47.740]
Oh, right.

[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.420]
You're right.

[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.440]
A real party.

[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:50.880]
A real, a real ride.

[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.320]
And of course, you can check out this week's feature, Heather Kelly, will be doing her thing.

[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:56.200]
And maybe if you're lucky, she might be doing you a little bit.

[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.840]
Kind of like Ben on Guiding Light.

[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.240]
Oh, please send Ben over here.

[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.560]
Now that he's doing his escort thing, that's 5 to 7 this afternoon at Treasurer Island.

[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.200]
Where has he been all my life, huh?

[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.040]
Anybody out there like Ben on Guiding Light?

[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:12.760]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.080]
Who do you think will be the next celebrity to die?

[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:15.840]
And I got news for you.

[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:19.400]
There must be a lot of us on the edge because there are a list of just humongous in it.

[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.160]
It's gigantic.

[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:27.320]
Don Eimes, Ronald Reagan, Jerry Lewis, Bob Hope, Catherine Hepburn, Ernie Borgnein, Neil Rogers.

[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:28.380]
Ho, ho!

[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.960]
Larry King, Johnny Cash, Mohaward Davidd, Art Linkletter, Charlton Heston, Marino Ahera, Jeff

[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.340]
High, AKA Fatboy, AKA Highboy as he's got on there.

[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.720]
Hank Goldberg, hey, stop it!

[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:47.060]
Rodney Dangerfield, the Pope, David Brinkley, Robert Blake, Paul Harvey, Billy Graham, Joy Bishop,

[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:50.060]
Marlon Brando, who's bigger than...

[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:52.700]
All the old people on the list put together.

[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:55.640]
Al Goldstein, well like I said, up until that point.

[01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:02.860]
Mickey Rooney, Gregory Schmack, a peck, Kirk Douglas, Rosemary, Keith Richards, Axel Rose, Red Hour

[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:05.640]
Bob Dylan, this list is unbelievable, you know what?

[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.540]
And we've only just begun.

[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.040]
Oh, how about Karen Carpenter, too late?

[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:09.220]
Too late.

[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.380]
Too late Karen, how about Richard?

[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:10.920]
How about Dick?

[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:20.600]
Strong Thurman, Papa Bush, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, John Critchin, Johnny Carson, Ed McMahon,

[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.520]
Bob Barker or Larry Hagman.

[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:23.860]
Is he looking really bad?

[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:29.560]
Yeah, he didn't look as bad as right after his...

[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.600]
He's always...

[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.100]
All those transplants he had, but he still looks pretty bad.

[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.340]
I'll be damned.

[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.640]
My last time I saw him, he had that David Brinkley, you know, with a one eyeball on his cheek.

[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.260]
Still has only one eyeball.

[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.000]
I tell you one thing, man, the Lord works in mysterious ways.

[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.860]
All you God people out there, the God squad.

[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.920]
If there's a God out there, what is going on with it?

[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:47.940]
Why is it that was...

[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:49.240]
And then of course, you know what the answer would be?

[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:52.680]
Well, we don't take care of ourselves and we don't eat properly and we don't exercise.

[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:56.840]
And as a result, yeah, like I told that one guy that day, another call, I'll never forget.

[01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:00.100]
When I gave him the story of what, you know, life and death is all about.

[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:04.180]
And I said, you're born and you, you know, you developed to a certain point.

[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.720]
And then your cell starts to die and your body starts dying.

[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.840]
And just like, I used an example, beautiful rose, you know.

[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:14.420]
And it blossoms and it flowers and it gets to its ultimate beauty.

[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:19.080]
And then it starts withering and like getting old and moldy and falling apart.

[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.400]
And the pedal starts falling off.

[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.200]
And it starts dying over here.

[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:23.000]
That's the one with Yamaha.

[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:23.420]
Exactly.

[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.840]
Oh, that's a terrible American person here.

[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.580]
No, it was not.

[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.660]
But it's just another one of his emotional cripples who can't see.

[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.460]
This is one of America's biggest problems.

[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:37.440]
And nobody wants to talk about it is that most of the rest of the civilized world handles with death with more dignity than America.

[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.760]
But we just like to pretend it's not there, you know.

[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:45.560]
Oh no, and that's why this religious fanaticism is so much stronger here than in most other supposedly civilized places.

[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:49.840]
Because we got all the heaven and hell bull crap, you know, and the purgatory crap in between.

[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.780]
And you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you better not do that.

[01:05:52.780 --> 01:06:01.940]
And all this other hocus pocus this crap that was to written down and told my word of mouth by a bunch of barbaric ancient assholes thousands of years ago who didn't know up from down.

[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.200]
Who thought every time it rained God was crying.

[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:10.980]
And you know, no, see your laughing, but seriously, how could I see these like last night the king myster, I saw two minutes of it.

[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:17.280]
He had a panel of religionists of Christians of various denominations and they were talking about the war and one is saying, oh no, we can't kill people.

[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:20.880]
And the other one, of course, he's rationalizing about, well, you know, Lord said this and blah, blah, blah.

[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:26.260]
And I'm thinking of myself, they're reading all of this crap that was written by these primitive ignorant, ass-old people.

[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:31.040]
And the masses in this country are just sucking on to it like somebody threw them a bone.

[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:37.780]
Use your brain, whatever you got left, okay? Use a little bit of it. Use some common freaking sense.

[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:38.420]
No.

[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.840]
I know. I'm surprised.

[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:41.440]
What?

[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:52.060]
Doing the same old farting into a wind storm like I always do, but it's just frustrating to me, especially having traveled just a little bit around and civilized places and seeing that you just don't see this much of this crap.

[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:57.320]
Even the silly brits over there, you know, it's the Church of England. That's just a place to go to socialize.

[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:01.280]
That's the place where they go and see all the other queens.

[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:03.720]
And what were you going to say?

[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.920]
I'm surprised to use roses in analogy.

[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:08.360]
Why is that?

[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.340]
I figured you would have chosen pansy.

[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.020]
See, I told you that Faxor was right.

[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.320]
Faxor had his thumb right on it.

[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.780]
And you know something, I should have just used that Fax behind the scenes. I didn't have to share it with you.

[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:23.440]
Yeah. See, there he goes again with his gay.

[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:28.360]
Don't like the Jews, don't like the Fax, don't like the Puerto Ricans. Is there anybody that he likes it on?

[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:28.560]
No.

[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.820]
Just that hot bitch at Treasure Island.

[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:32.520]
What's going on?

[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.040]
See how hot it's getting already?

[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.040]
Oh, what a segue.

[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:39.640]
Just turning on a hot stove to cook dinner, turn you off when it's 110 degrees in the shade like it's already in South Florida.

[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.240]
Maybe you ought to start grilling.

[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.340]
And for all your barbecue needs, shop at Barbecue's Galore.

[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:51.760]
Barbecue's Galore's got the guaranteed lowest prices in town and this weekend they get even lower than usual because Barbecue's Galore is holding their big jackpot.

[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.820]

This Thursday, which sounds like tomorrow to me, plus Friday Saturday and Sunday only,

[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:03.180]
take advantage of big savings like 15% off most Barbecue's accessories at Barbecue's Galore.

Save over 275 bucks on a 52 inch grand turbo stainless steel cart with rear rotisserie stainless grills and side burner.

[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:11.400]
The price is unbeatable.

[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.680]
Or how about saving on a Weber grill just great for tailgating.

[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:18.940]
There's a Barbecue for every price range and smokers and patio heaters and accessories and cookbooks and sauces.

[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.220]
They're all on sale too.

[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.940]
You get a big selection, awesome sale prices, unknowledgeable and friendly staff.

[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:25.660]
They'll fit you with the right grill for what you're looking for.

[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:31.100]
Pop brands, great service and the annual spring sale going on this Friday through Sunday only at Barbecue's Galore.

[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.120]
Now wait a minute, didn't say up here.

[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:36.620]
This Thursday, Friday, now who gave me this copy? Who's the count as this?

[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.540]
He, oh, PD Lenny.

[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:42.500]
Hey, you're an asshole, PD Lenny because the copy says this Thursday Friday, Saturday and Sunday only.

[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:46.940]
And now it says going on Friday through Sunday only at Barbecue's Galore, I think PD made a mistake.

[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.540]
You made a mistake, you asshole.

[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:49.560]
You little munchkin.

[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:54.360]
Barbecue's Galore, they are the barbecue specialist no matter what PD Lenny said.

[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:58.160]
Say 15% all weekend long at Barbecue's Galore, they're located in Plantation and Coral Springs.

[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:07.580]
For more info and exact store locations from Barbecue's Galore Coralettes, color toll free number, 1-800-grill-up, 1-800-grill-up, and maybe even pop PD Lenny on it for a first sacrifice.

[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.000]
Five and a local, this is five cities.

[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.800]
The radio's all yours now.

[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.640]
Q and.

[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.260]
Translando el pollo para acá.

[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.040]
A baby is trauma, mama.

[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:03.680]
Don't like these things just like someone out of his own neighborhood and just doing it like Nike.

[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:04.200]
He cheated.

[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:06.220]
He counts of the American friends at White House.

[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.700]
They find out he got his own thing going with the lights out.

[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:09.800]
And now he's got a new chow.

[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:11.140]
It's a baby at a with lock.

[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:11.900]
Rubberpots.

[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:12.380]
It's a baby.

[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.060]
Fuck up.

[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:13.680]
We have a hat lock.

[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:14.820]
He loves to wipe and everything.

[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.160]
But she ain't the one who'll lay down.

[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.700]
He wanna rip up 38 years of marriage to Jack Lepram.

[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.120]
I remember when he thought it's all together when we was divided.

[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.740]
That this guy had folks out known as the Great Luna Viya.

[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.340]
Miss Guided.

[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:25.600]
We lost utmost respect.

[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.480]
It is all true.

[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.060]
All you did is rip that lady.

[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:28.960]
As you call, move.

[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:29.540]
Yeah.

[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.520]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.340]
It's the story of.

[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:38.480]
And with you, no reason but size is a thousand times each.

[01:10:46.820 --> 01:11:00.420]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:01.100]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:08.460]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:08.460]

[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.300]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.880]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.040]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:36.220]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:36.320]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:36.380]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:36.380]

[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:36.380]

[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:36.400]

[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:36.460]

[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:36.460]

[01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:36.540]

[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:36.880]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:37.240]

[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:37.240]

[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:37.240]

[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:37.240]

[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:37.240]

[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:37.240]

[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:37.240]

[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:37.360]

[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:37.360]

[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:37.360]

[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:37.360]

[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:37.360]

[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:37.360]

[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:38.040]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:38.440]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:38.860]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:40.060]
He's an elderly dad.

[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.400]
He's been so much about it.

[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:42.540]
That's what he said.

[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.560]
It happened more reason he should be.

[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.940]
Dad the news released this is Thomas Duke.

[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.140]
So he quit topping wrestling for the George W.

[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.340]
Inodor Operation.

[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:51.420]
I'm a Jackson.

[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.680]
That's the reality.

[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.220]
Get down and kneel.

[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:07.300]
You can't be your wife, you should apologize.

[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.160]
That's the girl who had you out.

[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:15.340]
197 votes. Who do you think is going to be the next celebrity to die?

[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.520]
I'm open up to list by the way very nicely. Do you see that?

[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:21.100]
Bob Hope 93. He's in a class by himself.

[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:22.240]
Robert Reagan 55.

[01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:26.620]
The Pope 15. Jerry Lewis 8. Don I'm a 7. And yours truly.

[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:30.880]
Bill, six. Everybody else is like 2's and 1's into the big.

[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:31.240]
Oh!

[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.480]
So far because we really screwed up this poll today bad.

[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.440]
You know what I'm saying, Carlos?

[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:36.400]
What is that?

[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:40.500]
Well, no, because when you put every all the other you got six choices up there for like 45 minutes

[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.140]
and then all the other ones go under like real late.

[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.320]
It's kind of like, you know, it lives a separate translation.

[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:45.820]
What?

[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.940]
If I had control of the poll, I could put them on there as well.

[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:50.820]
And I don't start with this again if you had control of the poll.

[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:55.320]
I think you should have control of the poll and Eric could do all of his other important stuff up there.

[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.460]
Like eat, eat himself into oblivion into a coma.

[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:02.620]
5670560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon line.

[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:03.840]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:04.820]
Hello.

[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:05.660]
Yes, sir.

[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:06.840]
Good morning, Mr. Rogers.

[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.140]
Good morning to you, sir.

[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:09.620]
I want to board.

[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:10.720]
Yes, the RF part.

[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:12.160]
Yes, sir.

[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:12.520]
I'm a fart.

[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:12.820]
Yeah.

[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:14.780]
And Muhammad Ali.

[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.700]
Oh, Muhammad Ali.

[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.720]
He's not looking too great.

[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:18.040]
Okay.

[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:18.620]
Thank you, sir.

[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.400]
Everyone would have thought either one of those.

[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:20.720]
You know what?

[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:21.320]
Yes, sir.

[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:21.800]
I'm a fart.

[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:24.700]
And Muhammad Ali.

[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:28.000]
Looking a little shaky these days.

[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:28.620]
Who's that?

[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.080]
Speaking of a Yasser, I'm a fart.

[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:31.960]
Yes.

[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.500]
LA Ram by Asmel Gibson, are we considered Jesus film?

[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:36.440]
Huh?

[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:40.540]
A prominent Jewish leader on Friday, boy, it took a long time for them to get this story.

[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.080]
I'll tell you that.

[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:41.840]
Where does it come from?

[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:43.580]
Huh.

[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:48.140]
Anyway, ask Demel Gibson to make sure in his new film on the last 12 hours in the life of Christ,

[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.720]
does not portray the Jews as collectively responsible for the crucifixion.

[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:56.520]
Ram by Marvin Hire, Dean and founder of the Simon Viesenthal Center, said he was concerned

[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.100]
because an article would be published in the New York Times magazine, portrays Gibson as

[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:03.360]
a traditionalist Catholic, opposed to the reforms of Vatican Tooth.

[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.860]
Hire said obviously no one has seen the passion and I certainly have no problem with

[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.980]
Mel Gibson's right to believe as he sees fit or make any movie he wants to.

[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:14.880]
What concerns me, however, is when I read what the film's purpose is to undo the changes

[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.120]
made by Vatican Tooth.

[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:20.560]
He said that the Vatican Conclave was convened to deal with several critical issues, including

[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.940]
the rejection of the notion that the Jews were collectively responsible for the death

[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:25.240]
of Jesus Christ killers.

[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:29.840]
If the new film seeks to undo Vatican Tooth, but I'm going to each more of these scourler's

[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.320]
changes of the charges of the aside.

[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:34.860]
Oh, I never heard that word before.

[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:35.740]
The aside.

[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.040]
I think of a lot.

[01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.700]
Directed against the Jewish people would sick.

[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:47.480]
Yeah, where did you find him?

[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:47.720]
Seriously.

[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:49.040]
What did you find him?

[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.280]
Like it in a dumpster somewhere?

[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:51.640]
You've been through it.

[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:52.300]
God.

[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:55.660]
Which took the Catholic to 20 centuries to finally be puny.

[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.440]
He said Gibson is completing the self-enhanced film in the last 12 hours in life of Christ,

[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.640]
and a friend of the Gibson family is quoted as telling New York Times that Gibson will

[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:05.260]
graphically portray the intense suffering of Christ.

[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:08.480]
Perhaps there's no film is done before Gibson is directing the film.

[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:14.580]
The last 12 hours of suffering like every, every groan, every Jesus Christ.

[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.280]
Exactly.

[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.220]
The friend Gary Jew-free.

[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:17.880]
Huh?

[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:22.560]
A traditionalist Catholic also said the film will lead the blame for the fact that if Christ

[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.500]
were it belongs, a reference that some traditionalists mean that the Jewish authorities who

[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.880]
presented over his trial, the article said, see, and again, like so many other people have

[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.840]
said, if this was all preordained, then this was supposed to happen anyway.

[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.160]
What difference does it make?

[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.320]
It would just help it into, you know, do his things.

[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:37.400]
It was all part of the plan.

[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:42.420]
It was all part of the big plan or that big plan in the sky so that we could have this

[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:46.280]
civilized way for people so we could forgive all of our sins and have life after death

[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.500]
and all this other hocus-pocus is the focus, okay?

[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:50.340]
Good, Golly Miss Molly.

[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.760]
I always told you to look out for that, Mel Gibson.

[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:53.980]
I'd george like some a lot more now.

[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:55.460]
I do?

[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.240]
Here's a call from Davy.

[01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:57.460]
Hello?

[01:15:59.440 --> 01:15:59.820]
Davy.

[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:00.780]
Hello.

[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:01.660]
Yes, sir.

[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:02.420]
Hi.

[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:03.040]
Good morning.

[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:04.100]
Dan back to you.

[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:09.240]
Yes, on Friday, I was a whole from a half hour.

[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.240]
I'm sorry, I got to work out of good and waited a long time.

[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:19.860]
The boy had a week and about the good looking people, I guess.

[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:22.920]
TV interview anchors is right.

[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:30.220]
Yeah, if I could refer back to them, I think to be, you know, make a fair adjustment.

[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:38.560]
Shouldn't it be like, you know, people with good features, you know, some people would

[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.880]
make up, you know, look one thing and then when you see them in person or...

[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:45.340]
You have had how many other people on that list have you ever seen in person?

[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:46.700]
I mean, it's a good point.

[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:51.220]
I've seen them, you know, I'm a touch-show, you know, without makeup.

[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.220]
You think when they go on, you think when they go on talk shows, they're not wearing makeup?

[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:01.840]
Well, but lightly, you know, you see all the blemishes, you know, pimples.

[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:04.320]
You don't see them all.

[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.000]
Yeah, but James Wood wasn't on the list.

[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.560]
Okay, you fought that, you know, a lot of women, you know, look at a man, you know, naturally.

[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.160]
No question about it.

[01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:21.460]
And when they put on makeup, you know, makeup, it looked better.

[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:24.540]
I guarantee you, Tom Walling's a lot prettier than most of those women on the list.

[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:26.020]
And have a great day, sir. Thank you so much.

[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:26.480]
What do you say?

[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:31.160]
He said that we want to see these women without makeup on, without clothes on.

[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.860]
We want to be able to inspect his what he said.

[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:35.920]
We want to inspect every pimple, every blemish, every tarnish.

[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:36.940]
We want to take a look in there.

[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:37.300]
Correct him.

[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:38.740]
Everything is what he said, right?

[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:39.440]
What's wrong with that?

[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.280]
He also said that.

[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.340]
Oh, we got a bank building evacuated, Miami, robbery.

[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:44.580]
How is time this past?

[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.080]
There's our good-for-suson candy audience here.

[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:46.960]
You're seeing a little less of that.

[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:52.080]
As you can see from some live pictures, perhaps, there are also pictures of police officers

[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:57.180]
standing around looking a little more relaxed, although they certainly have not cleared the

[01:17:57.180 --> 01:17:58.580]
scene by any means.

[01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:02.000]
This has been going on for about three and a half hours now.

[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.380]
Heidi, Susan, two good questions for you.

[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.000]
I'm thinking about communications from within that building possibly.

[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:12.800]
Anyone try to call out that you have heard of and also about the Dixie Highway that is

[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:15.000]
a major road that's been closed down because of this, right?

[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.080]
That's right.

[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:16.580]
That's right.

[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:21.840]
If indeed, the authorities are talking to employees inside the building to the degree

[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:25.700]
they've been successful, they haven't shared so far what they've learned, other than

[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:27.860]
the information about the guard coming upon these birds.

[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:30.000]
A parent burglary attempted Miami Bank Building.

[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:30.880]
Well, what's all this at mean?

[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:31.880]
What Miami Bank Building?

[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.280]
I mean, what is this?

[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.660]
And this is WSVN that they were carrying the pictures for.

[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:40.960]
Which has caused huge traffic jins in about a 20 block area where this is happening.

[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:46.620]
And so until they can get this whole situation resolved, it's likely they will keep the streets

[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:49.920]
blocked off until they can figure out exactly what they have on their hands.

[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:51.420]
All right, very good.

[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.780]
And we will come back to you if you learn anything else.

[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.800]
Yes, we certainly will.

[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.880]
Thanks to CNN for that marvelous coverage.

[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:58.820]
It would be nice if they would have told us where the hell it was.

[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:00.920]
That's our great close friend Susan Candy-Odie.

[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:01.360]
Remember Susan?

[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:01.780]
Of course.

[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:02.600]
Love Susan.

[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:05.220]
But anyway, there's just some crap going on.

[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:06.260]
5, 6, 7.

[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:10.920]
And of course, our great news coverage here on QAM, our Stute News Day.

[01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:14.440]
In other words, just wait till the war starts if you think our numbers are marginal now,

[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:14.900]
just wait.

[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:15.960]
Wow.

[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:20.740]
I mean, can you believe that if there would have been some kind of a sports game would have

[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:23.980]
broken out in South Fixie Highway, we'd have been doing the play by play of it right

[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:24.240]
now.

[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:25.360]
A sports emergency.

[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:26.220]
Exactly.

[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.400]
Some emergency ballgame would have broken out.

[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.780]
Maybe an emergency gocturne in the middle of the Fixie Highway.

[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:34.400]
But not because this isn't a ballgame.

[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:36.020]
Those of us are QAM all we do.

[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.220]
We're like that.

[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.360]
We don't want to know nothing.

[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:39.940]
We don't want to know nothing.

[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:40.300]
We don't know nothing.

[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:40.860]
And that's it.

[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.340]
If it ain't sports, it ain't us.

[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:43.720]
Here's Miami.

[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:44.100]
Hello.

[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:45.540]
You doing another ball?

[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:45.960]
Oh, damn.

[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:46.900]
Oh, God.

[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:48.260]
And you know what?

[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:50.260]
That wasn't even the right guy.

[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.960]
That wasn't even the same guy.

[01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:53.420]
I guess it's catching on.

[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:54.500]
That might have been pretty good.

[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:57.520]
But catching on and also not getting him on the ear is also catching on in this end.

[01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:59.660]
That yellow button is catching on a big time on the ear.

[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:04.820]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon.

[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:05.840]
We've got a pool here.

[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:06.800]
We're going to stick deep in your neck.

[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:07.980]
You probably enjoy it.

[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:08.380]
Okay, sir.

[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:10.460]
We invite you to stop by.

[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:11.800]
In fact, maybe a treasurer island night.

[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.020]
Somebody like to stick their pool in that.

[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:13.380]
Back home.

[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:14.380]
Bobby Fitton.

[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.200]
That would be good.

[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:17.760]
He said roses are red.

[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:18.560]
Why can't his neck?

[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.360]
He read to something is blue.

[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:22.660]
Here's Hollywood.

[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:23.080]
Hello.

[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:24.360]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:24.920]
Okay.

[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:28.280]
I ate in through up the circle, jerk, but let's talk about the war for a minute.

[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:29.640]
No, that's not, Woody.

[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:31.420]
That's not.

[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.740]
Well, that's two in a row.

[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:33.180]
Nice going.

[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:34.200]
We're on a roll.

[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:38.020]
And I would be glad to give you the new tank for Brandy's, but unfortunately Trois Draper

[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:38.420]
didn't bother.

[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.380]
I'll tell you one thing.

[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.160]
Boy, there must be some real circle jerks going on back there in the sale department.

[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.880]
You are psychic, man.

[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:44.640]
Yeah.

[01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:46.140]
What is that?

[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.340]
Why you just brought it?

[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.360]
It's a little bit late now.

[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:50.900]
You can fact it to me.

[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:53.380]
I'll do the spot slowly, okay, so that we can get the tank.

[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.840]
What a moron he is, man.

[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:55.860]
Rub his head a little bit.

[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:56.840]
See if anything happens.

[01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:57.980]
Rub his bald spot.

[01:20:58.980 --> 01:20:59.300]
God.

[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:03.380]
Didn't I speak to him like a quarter to nine this morning and tell him we need, which we

[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:07.640]
got copied from Poppano Park that was sitting on his death for days, that Steve will faxed

[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:11.000]
him last week on March the 8th or something like that, which I see the data on it, which

[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.460]
we didn't have it on a timely fashion.

[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.360]
And now we got this coming here right now.

[01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:17.120]
I think Trois got Todd's right disease.

[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:22.700]
Maybe from some of that water, hanky, panky their plan.

[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.960]
I'm Tonya, something going on back there.

[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:29.280]
Some of that deep throat.

[01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:30.060]
Brrrr.

[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:30.880]
It gets my drip.

[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.820]
Anyway, fact it to me and I'll stick it in.

[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:36.500]
Anyway, this year, Brandy's is celebrating the 25th year in business.

[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.760]
Everybody's having an anniversary.

[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:42.120]
All of us great people this year, my 27th, Moe had one in an anniversary too.

[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:45.860]
Any independent family, Schuster that's been around for nearly a quarter of a century

[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:50.160]
has got to be doing a lot of things right like offering a fantastic selection of men's

[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:54.200]
and women's famous brand names like Rock Ports, Echoes, Mephisto, Timberland, Clarks,

[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.440]
S.A.S. Floorshime and all other big names in a business.

[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.760]
And then the wide range of sizes, Tom Muddling would be delighted to shop there.

[01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:03.840]
Men's sizes six all the way up to 15, women's five to 12 and what's from the very narrow

[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:04.580]
to the very wide.

[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.540]
And don't forget their professional sales staff that will help you pick out the right

[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:10.820]
styles and then sit your ass down and fit those shoes to your individual feet giving

[01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:13.820]
you a friendly professional service no matter how bad your feet may sting.

[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:18.160]
And with over 40,000 pair of in stock and their 8,000 square foot megastore, you're almost

[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:18.620]
never here.

[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.740]
Sorry, Mr. We don't have your size in that shoe.

[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.960]
So when you need shoes, take your feet to brandy shoes.

[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.640]
I don't hear the facts machine going by the way.

[01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:26.620]
What?

[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:27.520]
Nothing.

[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:28.100]
There's no facts.

[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:29.620]
Oh boy.

[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:30.360]
So what does that mean?

[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:32.540]
What is that?

[01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:34.340]
Why did you hang me out to dry again?

[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.760]
I'm going to read that facts again.

[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:36.600]
Oh, the whole nice style.

[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:37.540]
I'm just going to read.

[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:38.060]
What?

[01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:40.020]
What did he come in there for?

[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.180]
A Stratford.

[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:43.720]
Take a shortcut through the studios.

[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.660]
Oh, he's got an email from Troy.

[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:48.360]
The other Troy.

[01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.420]
Brandy is a great place to shop for shoes.

[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:55.940]
We ought to treat them a lot better than this, but Troy Stratford's an asshole.

[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.700]
Brandy shoes at 1290 North Federal Highway, Palm Ptole, and Daily Nine to Nine.

[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:04.200]
Some days 10 to 5, and we apologize profusely to our friends at Brandy's that Troy is a piece

[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:04.560]
of crap.

[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:10.880]
We're sports radio fighters here at 2AM.

[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:13.340]
K-T.

[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.920]
I don't have to grow up.

[01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:17.700]
I'm a Dunzer-us kid.

[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.380]
So I can always kill myself for something that I did.

[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:24.920]
It's gonna be cool when I kill everyone at school.

[01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:26.380]
Lost my dad's head.

[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.700]
It's okay.

[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:30.120]
I'll exercise my right.

[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:34.780]
That's why we end our A that lets me be a Dunzer-us kid.

[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:39.000]
In the Dunzer-us kid, I told him how to shoot.

[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.400]
Well, he really loved the sound of blood.

[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:42.860]
Now ain't that Gondäkjut.

[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:48.980]
I'm a homo-saddle, Nazi redneck, with the sides on the internet.

[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:49.800]
All right.

[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:53.360]
I'm a lifetime member of the NRA.

[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:56.200]
That's why I raised the Gunzer-us kid.

[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.980]
Oh boy, I couldn't hear my gun.

[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:03.520]
A blood that Laura Gunzer-us kid.

[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:08.160]
11-0-3 at 560, WQM, our big noon to 1 hour coming up.

[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.900]
And I can't come fast enough as far as I'm concerned.

[01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:12.000]
This is kind of a disjointed day, you know what?

[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:12.320]
Yeah.

[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:16.900]
Yesterday we had a spectacular day with those annoying songs.

[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.380]
And I couldn't even just know what's never gonna happen two days in a row.

[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:21.780]
This poll today is going over like a lead balloon.

[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.260]
Not good.

[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:25.840]
And I think we got off to a bad start.

[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.160]
And we're all good news is I'm moving up on the list.

[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:31.320]
Who do you think is gonna be the next celebrity to croak?

[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:36.680]
Bob Hope 105, model Reagan 61, the Pope 18, the Arrogers 10.

[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:37.020]
Oh!

[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:44.780]
Jerry Lewis 9, Mojauer David 8, Don I'm a 7 in Johnny Cash for everybody else, Mopatitis.

[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:48.420]
Now this thing that Trace Draven gave you that you just faxed to me.

[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:48.800]
Yeah.

[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:49.700]
Pathetic.

[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:52.540]
Pathetic.

[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:55.640]
You just presumed he came in here to give you that copy you were waiting for.

[01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:00.340]
Well, I mean, wouldn't that be logical since I already told him that we don't have a tag and he got last week's tag editor,

[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:01.580]
which I'm not gonna read in every week.

[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.060]
We had a special sale at Brandys, which has been on a hundred years.

[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:06.960]
And this man doesn't want to do his goddamn job and give me the information.

[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:09.840]
And Poppano said on his desk day after day after day.

[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:14.420]
And the reason being that there's no god day, you can't complain about the leadership at QAIM because there isn't any.

[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.560]
You got screw-in back there who keeps, you know, falling into the goddamn door knobs.

[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:24.920]
You got Todd Dreck who's the invisible man, the amazing little invisible midget.

[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:30.820]
And then we got a bunch of guys like PD Lenny, but I don't know why they're like grumpel stillskin bouncing up and down.

[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.580]
So hopped up on goddamn drugs and they did he ever come in straight out that copy that we did.

[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:37.140]
Did he ever do something about that?

[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:41.120]
About Barbecue's galore that we got two different dates for the sale on it.

[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:41.440]
No.

[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:43.480]
So let me tell you again, screw-in.

[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:44.360]
Nice job, sweetheart.

[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.020]
Your wholesale department is all eight.

[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:47.640]
How you this go?

[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:48.360]
OOC.

[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:49.520]
Out of control.

[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:50.280]
OOC.

[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:51.480]
Out of frickin control.

[01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:52.100]
Bitch.

[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:53.100]
God.

[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:56.200]
Anyway, what am I, see you getting me excited again?

[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:57.000]
I'm not even there.

[01:25:57.180 --> 01:25:58.320]
I'm getting more from about that place.

[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:01.680]
And I think these call these people on this pool they get their out of it.

[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.340]
I just had another stroke and that place it gets to you, man.

[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.540]
It will shorten your life.

[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:07.160]
It'll kill you.

[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:09.240]
It'll put your ass over the edge.

[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.740]
Hey, Walt Vian Deerfield, you're a good guy, but put bugging me with crap, okay?

[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:18.400]
Why did you even waste your time with that?

[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:18.880]
Some crap.

[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:19.480]
Yeah.

[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:22.200]
Andy Roney on 60 minutes looks like he should be on your pool.

[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:23.640]
Andy Roney would be good, don't you think?

[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:25.900]
Andy Roney would be great.

[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.720]
Okay, we're adding to it.

[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.340]
I'm just a little sour with a truck stratford crap.

[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:33.920]
There's the one guy that we had that you hate to be, huh?

[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:34.500]
Don't hate.

[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:35.680]
Don't be nice.

[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:36.740]
I got nothing to do with hate.

[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:39.140]
It's got to do with the guys that don't want to do their frickin job.

[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:44.000]
And then it gives you this stupid ass email from the other Troy over at Balance for Life.

[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.760]
Oh, and by the way, and you have to put this aid by the way.

[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:49.920]
Wouldn't he listen to you for the instructional letter we got?

[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:51.880]
Don't say by the way.

[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.360]
By the way, this is a heavy library.

[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:55.020]
What?

[01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:57.120]
This Wallyfuck is actually very important.

[01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:58.360]
Why is that?

[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:03.120]
Because they're promoting this here locally big time like it's some sort of a rock and roll festival.

[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:04.720]
And it's an evangelist.

[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:08.860]
The beach fest would Lewis Palau on Fort Lauderdale Beach marks 22nd.

[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:13.900]
It's a Brazilian evangelist who's holding a hoax pocus voodoo get together for all the good Christian immigrants.

[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.600]
Have you any insight in maybe the event of the why is that important?

[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.180]
Because I didn't they have TV ads billboards.

[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:23.960]
They have signs everywhere bumper stickers and a lot of people are going to get sucked into this thing thinking that's a rock and roll show.

[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.680]
That's what I thought it was until I got this facts.

[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:27.200]
Well, maybe they can help you.

[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:28.400]
You think?

[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:34.500]
Maybe you can get some of that good old time religion out there on the beach or maybe get laid or both.

[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.020]
Anyway, getting back to this.

[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:37.960]
I think that guy was right.

[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:40.060]
The more I'm listening to what's going on here today, you notice Carlos?

[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:43.000]
Every time I start saying something, how he interrupts.

[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.400]
Every time I can't even get any.

[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.780]
Oh, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way.

[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:50.920]
It's just I have a new advertiser here in Chicago.

[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:52.240]
His name is Jay Marvin.

[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.120]
See, it does mean a new advertiser.

[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:55.660]
Troy.

[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:59.940]
Oh, the I'm telling you between these two Troy's if brains were dangerous, they'd be a safe haven.

[01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:04.760]
Jay Marvin a new a new guy doing our spots is what it should say.

[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:05.960]
He knows Neil from Tampa.

[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.180]
He knows me.

[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:07.660]
I don't know.

[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:08.380]
You know, Jay Marvin.

[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:09.200]
I was awful.

[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.140]
He was on FLA.

[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:14.780]
He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and so excited about doing a balance for life.

[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.340]
He's doing exactly what Neil does.

[01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:17.280]
9-11 talk radio.

[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:17.780]
I doubt it.

[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.840]
But with a female sidekick who also gets a bag.

[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.540]
That's like saying that more Howard David is working with a sidekick who also gets a bag.

[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:26.060]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:28.020]
God.

[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:30.780]
We sent him to food.

[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:31.460]
He does the live spot.

[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:34.480]
And then the thing I love best today was two minutes and 15 seconds.

[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:37.140]
Don't you love advertisers who time the spots?

[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:40.540]
That's like her goal of years ago.

[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:42.080]
Yeah, what's wrong with my commasals?

[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.720]
It was only 58 seconds today.

[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:44.720]
Hey, herbie.

[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:46.180]
To you, okay, asshole.

[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:47.400]
Let's see.

[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:48.000]
It's a sorry mess.

[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:48.780]
Yesterday's poll.

[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:50.900]
The two most puke inducing songs is this one.

[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:54.180]
Blinded blind me with science and going Japanese.

[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:57.000]
Well, he's not having a turning Japanese and blinded.

[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.080]
What is he blinded me with?

[01:28:58.160 --> 01:28:59.020]
He blinded me with science.

[01:28:59.260 --> 01:28:59.720]
Well, he's close.

[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:00.400]
Thank you, Dave.

[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:01.120]
You're close.

[01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:02.340]
And the board goes back.

[01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:04.780]
Point at Fred's strafford.

[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:07.480]
I'm just the one guy you hang your head on.

[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.160]
You think here's one guy that really gives a crap.

[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:09.660]
He don't care.

[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:10.960]
He's just another goofball.

[01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:11.880]
Another ex-jock.

[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:15.360]
Okay, Steven Hill.

[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.100]
I don't even know who to hell Steven Hill is.

[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:18.740]
Oh, and I look at this.

[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.460]
Now he gives this to you, huh?

[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:20.860]

[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:27.860]
Now that I did the spot 15 minutes ago, now we get to tag.

[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.100]
So if you remember, we were talking about Brandy's what a great place it is to take your feet for the shoes and all that stuff in Pomato Beach.

[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:36.900]
Now all this week at Brandy's, take 20% off of all spurry top-siders.

[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:39.000]
Men's and women's only at Brandy's this week.

[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:40.020]
You asshole.

[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:41.220]
That's for you, Troy.

[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:42.160]
You asshole.

[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:42.860]
You're an idiot.

[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:44.380]
One more time, oh.

[01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:45.280]
You asshole.

[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:45.820]
And a boy.

[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:47.700]
How do you like that, huh?

[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.600]
So in other words, it's not as if there wasn't one.

[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:54.080]
It's just that he can't get around to getting it done.

[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:55.500]
He can't get it done.

[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:56.440]
You asshole.

[01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:57.580]
We hate you, Troy.

[01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:58.900]
We can't stand you.

[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:03.200]
Plus I think he just paints that on.

[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:03.840]
I think he's white.

[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:05.920]
Now what's this other crap?

[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.840]
Stephen Hill, Charles Lane, Carl Valentine.

[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:12.200]
Oh, this has got to be from, oh, Jack Par, by the way, just was hospitalized.

[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:13.860]
He better be on her, Jack Par.

[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:16.220]
Got it.

[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.820]
He just went in the hospital over the weekend.

[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:19.020]
Yeah, that's from Oysterneck.

[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:20.860]
Yeah, what was that going to tell you?

[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:22.380]
I'm not going to look at it, okay?

[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:27.380]
I can't deal with people who live in the distant past, okay?

[01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.940]
If it was up to Oysterneck, our average demographic would be 90 plus.

[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.880]
We'd be taking names of listeners instead of celebrities.

[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.700]
Just which listener do you think is going to quote me?

[01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:39.880]
No, seriously, if it was up to him because he's living in the distant past,

[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:43.880]
putting names on there that nobody under the age of 400 ever heard of.

[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:46.720]
Here's Miami.

[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:47.060]
Hello.

[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:48.120]
Hello.

[01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:49.020]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:49.960]
Neil.

[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:50.640]
Yes.

[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.160]
Is this a conservative who you're listening here, Neil?

[01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:53.740]
See?

[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:55.000]
It's a miracle.

[01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:57.420]
A little disappointed George, Neil.

[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:03.960]
He forgot to keep the old green two-spigs hopes alive by adding Mr. Patel Castro to the list.

[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:04.880]
Oh, yeah, there you go.

[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:05.200]
Fidel.

[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:09.360]
Oh, he's not looking great, but he's a better-shaped than Jack Par.

[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:10.320]
But I'll put it on there, sir.

[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:11.500]
All right, Neil.

[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:12.400]
Now, class, I hope.

[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:13.720]
Nothing, nothing, Neil.

[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:14.240]
Yes.

[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:16.840]
I got to keep the old Julio tradition alive.

[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.300]
You, Marie, come.

[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:18.900]
Thank you.

[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:20.000]
Okay, very weakly.

[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.500]
That was very weak.

[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.000]
That was very weak.

[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.980]
Here's one to keep Miguel happy.

[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:26.980]
It was probably Miguel's boyfriend.

[01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:29.100]
I did it, did it, did it, did it.

[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.420]
To hell with it, L. In fact, I'll say it again.

[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:34.040]
I still think we ought to be taking care of Cuba before we worry about Iraq.

[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:34.640]
Okay.

[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:36.520]
There were a lot closer, a lot more dangerous.

[01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:41.160]
They represent a, in fact, just look at Carlos and George right there to show what a danger they represent to the list.

[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:41.380]

[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:42.120]
We wouldn't be here.

[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:42.920]
That's right.

[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:45.040]
Two great examples of the danger that they threaten.

[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:46.440]
Just think of all the others just like them.

[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:48.120]
Just think of more alien episodes.

[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:48.980]
We can only pray.

[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:49.920]
All his fault.

[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.220]
Oh, my God.

[01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:51.300]
Oh, my God.

[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:52.560]
Oh, my God.

[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:52.900]
Puppy.

[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, this list is just gigantic.

[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:57.840]
Too bad nobody seems to care about it.

[01:31:58.520 --> 01:31:59.860]
Well, I guess it's morbid, you know.

[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:01.660]
They don't want some morbid, especially in the middle of it.

[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:02.340]
It was not a good idea.

[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.620]
You should have told me not to do this.

[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:04.400]
To it.

[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:04.660]

people get after they always you know it's like this it's like the OJ syndrome you know about well

[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:29.180]
he's you know even as until he's proven guilty I don't know if you're wrong okay pal have a great

[01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:35.040]
thing just don't sleep with him I won't which celebrity you think is going to be dying next and

[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:38.400]
when we say celebrity I mean I'm on air and Moe and Hank and some other I mean we're not really

[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:42.520]
big celebrities but why not put us on air because you know we're doing pretty well I am I got

[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:48.680]
16 votes and most got 15 huh yeah and away things are going today I think I may move up that

[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:55.320]
list real fast like to the top uh Bob Hope 131 Ronald Reagan 74 see the fact I mean I understand

[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:59.740]
it it's very difficult to communicate clearly from so far away but the reason I asked the

[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:03.840]
question is if he just said it yesterday it's certainly possible that maybe it'll be late today

[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:07.680]
before it shows up or maybe even tomorrow do you see what I'm saying yeah the point he was

[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:11.620]
trying to make is that he said the same day that he always sends it so he should get it should have

[01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:16.220]
and that and that and that was my point he was that I did not get it there was no message of any

[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:20.360]
package having arrived any FedEx any other goddamn package and my point being that that would be

[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:24.960]
a real serious problem if all my craftstarts the stuff's to show up you see what I've been saying yeah

[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:33.400]
I'm ready to pop some cough drops here John Paul's got 27 the Arranger 16 Moe Howard David

[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:33.300]
I just wanna speak- but did you relationship your sour photograph solved to this fourth piece of last word?

[01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:39.440]
In American Atomic Friendship, above every single word you have in Etern Bombs and classical popular cyber ganze I preaching

[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:43.780]
coronable proof that Phil Spector was innocent of any crime attorney Bobby Shapiro.

[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:48.860]
Phil is associated press. You notice how these people just never go away. They might go

[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:52.760]
in a hiding for a little while and sooner or later they surface again the same old,

[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:54.220]
tired suspects all over.

[01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:55.520]
Oh, man, oh, man.

[01:57:56.460 --> 01:58:00.020]
Bobby Shapiro said the AP speaking publicly about the case for the first time since his

[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:03.620]
clients February 3rd arrest. Spector 62 was arrested for investigation of the murder

[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:07.080]
and released after posting a million dollars bail. He hasn't been charged and authorities

[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:09.160]
say they're investigating. They're looking into it.

[01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:09.800]
Oh, man.

[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:14.020]
Bobby Shapiro. Well, one thing you do know for sure is that he won't be teaming up with

[01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:18.060]
Fleabaly or Johnny Cochrane on this one. No, they don't want no part of him and the feeling

[01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:18.980]
is mutual evidently.

[01:58:19.980 --> 01:58:23.760]
Here's a good one. It says, how can you possibly forget Mike Wallace? He looks glued together.

[01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:27.320]
You're right. He's still going strong, but he's about 145 years old. I put him down.

[01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:35.680]
What about Edward R. Morrell? Oh, sorry. Well, nobody told me, you know, 5'6, 7'0, 5'60,

[01:58:36.580 --> 01:58:41.920]
on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line. Who do you think will be the next celebrity to die?

[01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:46.440]
Bob Hope, 141. We really did screw this all up. I have it. He's under the beginning, you

[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:51.540]
know, the 5'6, under for like an hour and it was bad. You think by now we'd have some

[01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:54.660]
clue how to do a pull. You know, Carl's, we'd have some clue how to do this right. Like,

[01:58:54.840 --> 01:59:01.520]
yesterday was sensational. Was magnificent. With 80's Indian votes under between the two

[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:05.800]
polls, we did over 1,500 votes on the two polls combined. And today we'll be lucky if

[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:07.960]
we get, do you know how many we're going to get?

[01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:17.800]
About 30, man. That's exactly exactly what I had in mind. Oh, God. Man, when you're not

[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:23.760]
there, it's so easy to forget just how depressing it is. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello.

[01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:29.120]
Yes, sir. How you doing? I'm doing okay. Hey, Neil, I was calling you from the day

[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:33.880]
land area, but now I'm in Miramar. But I wanted to let you know a little bit about the

[01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:38.540]
making good progress or just keep on going. I know I'm headed that way. Wanted to let

[01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:42.860]
you know about the bank robbery. It's at the Metro bank on day land in day land.

[01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:49.200]
Okay. And they've got all the areas blocked off with every kind of police car motor vehicle.

[01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:54.480]
Anything they can shove in the way to get you stay away. And it's still going on, huh?

[01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:58.980]
Yeah. And they got hostages inside. I heard the poor cleanup people were the first ones

[01:59:58.980 --> 02:00:05.320]
to get approached by these people. Okay. Thanks for the info. Have a great day, buddy.

[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:09.800]
And you too. So there you go. It's almost noon. It took us only three hours to finally get

[02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:13.180]
a little bit of news information from one of our listeners out there because the stuff

[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:16.260]
they had on CNN with Susan candy outies, much as I love Susan, it was kind of like

[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:20.460]
but a beep. But it didn't really say anything. Or maybe we just missed that part. I don't

[02:00:20.460 --> 02:00:23.880]
think so. But at any rate. So there you go. It's down by day land. And they got the

[02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:27.340]
Dixie highway all jammed up and closed up. So no wonder everybody's a little bit

[02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:32.040]
psychotic down in Dave County. You know what I'm saying? More so than usual? A little

[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:38.440]
countertops in Dave. Here's a call from four lotterdale. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir.

[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:43.480]
How are you? I'm okay. Hello, George. Hey. Hi. Do you have a couple names for your

[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:47.140]
list? These guys aren't they haven't reached a hundred years old yet. But I think they

[02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:52.380]
should be on the list right there with the other guys. Are you there? I'm here. I'm always

[02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:58.260]
just sticking in his two cents in there. Okay. Number one Johnny dark. Johnny dark. Johnny

[02:00:58.260 --> 02:01:05.000]
dark. Yes. He's not. Johnny dark isn't an old guy. He's not sick. Johnny dark. Huh?

[02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:13.680]
Johnny dark. That's right. I think I think someone was who Alex Fallon. He's not old.

[02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:19.080]
But he deserves to be on the list. What? Get out of this guy. This guy is like a Lala

[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:24.960]
land. What is that? What is that? He's not an old guy. But he deserves to be on the list

[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:28.960]
based on what? Because he don't like him. We're not asking who we will do that another day.

[02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:32.900]
Okay. Who do you wish would die? Oh, brother. I can just see all the votes that I'll get.

[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:38.160]
And we'll put George on that one too. Of course. And Mo. No, no, no, not asking who do you wish

[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:41.380]
would die? In fact, we're never going to do that. Paul, that's an evil. That's hostile.

[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:49.060]
Anger. But for some sort of like I said, tomorrow. If you could put one magic

[02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:52.980]
curse, who would you like to see die right now? Well, you know, any other place nobody

[02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:56.460]
would do a hostile hateful pull like that. But being in South Florida, it's the perfect

[02:01:56.460 --> 02:02:02.080]
thing if you know what I mean. Yeah, sure is. And by the way, I don't want you to get nervous,

[02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:05.280]
but I still haven't had no package. No call about any package down there. I'm going

[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:10.280]
to do some tracking. Yeah. You're going to do some tracking. If I was you, I keep my

[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:14.540]
nose real clean. Okay. I'd be popping cockroaches 10 at a time. And then of course,

[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:22.280]
you'll keep you busy all day. 5 6 7 0 5 60. I can't do that again. 5 6 7 0 5 60

[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:28.700]
pound 5 60 on a AT&T. Here's Miami. Hello. Okay. Thank you so much. That was one of the

[02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:33.860]
better calls this hour. I'll say that. At least she was a cooperative. Pembroke Pines.

[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:40.640]
Hello. She was at least friendly. Pembroke Pines. Hey, Nailie George. Hey, yes, sir.

[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.920]
Hey, have a Joey Bishop and Rodney Dangerfield. Both on there. Thank you. I guess I better read

[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:48.880]
the whole list again from the top, but we're almost done with this. Thank God. This was a,

[02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:53.340]
you know, they can't be winners every day. They can't be in a good whoever facts this me,

[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:58.480]
me this idea. Don't ever facts me an idea for a pull again. No, I'm not, they're not blaming

[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:01.440]
anybody else. I'm not like some other people we have on this station to point their fingers

[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:05.080]
at everybody else for their own failures. I screwed up, you know, the guy made me a suggestion.

[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:08.900]
And I thought, well, it's been too bad. I thought it was okay. Didn't you? Yeah, I thought it

[02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:12.800]
was a good idea. I thought was kind of fun sitting around speculating who's going to croak next,

[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:18.200]
but the audience said, don't like it. They hate it. They hate it. Who do you think will be the next

[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:23.080]
celebrity famous person, whatever to die? Don I miss Ronald Reagan, Jerry Lewis Bob Hope,

[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:30.340]
Catherine Hepburn, Ernest Borg-Nine, Neil Rogers. Oh, God. Larry King. Johnny Cash, Mojauer

[02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:36.120]
David Add. Art Link Letter, Trowel and Heston, Marino Harajef, High A.K. A. Fat Boy, Hank Goldberg,

[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:41.040]
Rodney Dangerfield, the Pope, David Brinkley, Robert Blake, Paul Harvey, Billy Graham,

Rose Marie, Keith Richards, Axel Rose, Red Hour Bach, Bob Dylan, Al Lewis, Grandpa,

[02:03:55.240 --> 02:04:01.660]
Strom Thurman, Papa Bush, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Jean Critchin. Why did we even put that

[02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:07.740]
on there? He's not that old. Because somebody called him. Oh, Johnny Carson, Ed McMahon, Bob Barker,

[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:14.040]
Larry Hagman, Yesor Amafart, Muhammad Ali, Andy Rooney, Jack Parr, who's not a good shape, I guess,

[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:19.000]
Off-and-out Castro, Dick Clark, Walter Crunkight, Avogoda, and Mike Wallace.

[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:31.640]
Hey, magnificent list to choose from, and I will keep the death watch going, okay? We'll

[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:39.980]
get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done.

[02:04:39.980 --> 02:05:01.620]
We'll get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done.

[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:15.500]
We'll get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done.

[02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:17.580]
We'll get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done.

[02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:31.600]
We'll get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done. We'll get it done.

[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:35.440]
Of course, again, the problem being that those first six were on air for like what about six hours?

[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:40.960]
40. It would be like having an election where you can only vote for one candidate for the first

[02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:45.560]
10 hours the polls are open and the other one you can give over him the rest of the time. The last

[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:51.500]
two. Like the last election. Right. You got it. Pope John Paul the tooth has got 28 votes and Mo and

[02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:57.240]
I are Nick and Nick knows to know is Mo. It's a race. It's a Hoss race. 20 votes a piece for me and

[02:05:57.240 --> 02:06:05.020]
Mo. How are David? It's a strong thirmin 15. Don I miss 13 in Jerry Lewis has 10 even though his face is the size of a Mount

[02:06:05.020 --> 02:06:09.400]
Rushmore. And you know, all this talk I don't want to sound morbid or anything, but they're talking about

[02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:14.720]
their targeting the Empire State Building. You know, the terrorists and so on. You remember who gave us the Empire State Building?

[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:20.020]
I mean, I mean, the Statue of Liberty. I'm sorry. We'll give us the Statue of Liberty. The French. The freedom.

[02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:31.680]
The freedoms. Here's Port St. Lucy. Hello. Hello, Uncle Neil. Yes, sir. Hello. How you doing? I'm doing okay. I'm getting this one in, but it's kind of late. Rosa Parks.

[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:39.440]
Yeah, she's older than Muthuzla. Oh, yeah. Any day now. Okay. I'm a great one. Thank you. Yeah. Batman drives in Rosa Parks.

[02:06:41.580 --> 02:06:48.140]
What? I'm sure that's old. No, it's not. I just made that up. And it's pretty weak. Just like this show today. Rosa Parks. We got

[02:06:48.140 --> 02:06:59.420]
her on a net. That's it. That's it. List is complete. What about that song by the 1910 fruit gum company?

[02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:10.000]
Two e two e two e. Huh? Or as Mel Gibson would say, do we do we do we? What about that one? I didn't realize Mel Gibson was also a little on the

[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:15.780]
semantics side. Did you? Oh, he's a Catholic, you know. Oh, well, that explains it.

[02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:21.020]
Anyway, we'll get the list is up on here and have a good time voting. If you don't want to vote on this poll,

[02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:24.200]
because obviously you hate it like poison. Just read all the bedtime stories. There's about a hundred of

[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:28.460]
money today, including a couple of other things. We'll knock your socks off. Okay. And also get some people really

[02:07:45.860 --> 02:07:50.880]
in your hands. More than a hundred thousand dollars of the uprograms and it won't cost you a cent to enter.

[02:07:51.260 --> 02:07:55.880]
That's because Pomato Park has free general parking and free admission every day and night. And that's

[02:07:55.880 --> 02:07:59.840]
not all. You can also take any losing betting tickets next Saturday. And I put your name and address on the

[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:31.860]

[02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:36.080]

[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:39.120]
You got all of that? No. Good.

[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:43.640]

Put the couch around. Put the couch around. I only start to work with the card for my shot.

[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:15.840]
Put it in person that I give me sex. Look who loves you.

[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:18.200]
You lose your own understanding. No surprise.

[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:20.020]
The white Peter is the main.

[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:23.000]
Whoa.

Put it in Mary's.

[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:40.220]
All right.

[02:10:41.220 --> 02:10:43.440]
Harry's the fairy and his.

[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:46.860]
Put it in Mary's.

[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:50.160]
Developating homo stories.

[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:51.340]
Yeah.

[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:58.020]
And Mary's homo has become very dope.

Home over the furtivore

[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:01.200]
Hello Mr. Rocker, hang down on the crib boy

[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:02.840]
Excuse me?

[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:07.860]
First up we will do the Ro-Shack test

[02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:08.700]
Which...

[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:10.780]
If they love when you roll your tongue like that all your boyfriends

[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:12.720]
Excuse me then?

[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:13.900]
Go ahead, go ahead

[02:13:13.900 --> 02:13:19.000]
The Ro-Shack test is in blood as they say in English

[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:24.580]
And I will show you in blood and you will tell me the first thing that pops into your mind

[02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:27.100]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come looking

[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:29.920]
Okay, what do you think this is?

[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:31.200]
Home over

[02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:33.120]
And this?

[02:13:33.420 --> 02:13:33.740]
Let's go

[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:36.180]
Okay, and this one?

[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:37.600]
Infected Haitian

[02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:41.120]
Alright, how about this?

[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:43.660]
Bobby Valentine riding the baloney pony

[02:13:45.180 --> 02:13:48.180]
Interesting, what, let's move along shall we?

[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:51.440]
Let's try some word association

[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:57.260]
I'll say word and you tell me the first thing that pops into your head

[02:13:57.260 --> 02:14:00.780]
Yeah, no Mr. Rocker, we haven't started yet

[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:03.800]
Alright, here we go

[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:07.440]
Dog, Gainus, Cat, Microwave

[02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:09.220]
The color blue

[02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:09.740]
Where?

[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:14.200]
You know, John, why don't we try waiting among before you respond?

[02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:14.800]
Jerk

[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:17.660]
Mr. Rocker, I only wish to be your friend

[02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:19.760]
Why you got me on his couch, dog?

[02:14:20.300 --> 02:14:20.620]
You, Mo?

[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:21.840]
What?

[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:22.680]
You, Fat Boy?

[02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:24.640]
John, I'm a married man

[02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:26.120]
Sure, yeah, what's your wife's name, Chuck?

[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:28.500]
No, actually it's Gladys

[02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:30.800]
Yeah, you're Gladys, you're name out that you're a Fat Boy

[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:32.260]
I'm out of here

[02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:34.200]
Wooo!

[02:14:34.820 --> 02:14:35.660]
Why are you running?

[02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:38.480]
Stop running, John

[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:41.660]
John, are you a wild thing?

[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:43.640]
Do you make my heart sing?

[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:47.040]
Hi, this is Jocelyn Elders

[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:47.980]
And I'm mad

[02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:50.520]
Mad at those right wing sons of bitches

[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:52.440]
That forced Bill Clinton to fire me

[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:54.740]
Just who the hell they think they are?

[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:58.980]
All I was trying to do was deal with the reality of sex and teenagers

[02:14:58.980 --> 02:15:02.780]
Maybe a Jesse Helms at Buffett Chip or Newt Gingrich

[02:15:02.780 --> 02:15:05.920]
Have butters of corn a little more, there wouldn't be so uptight

[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:08.480]
Flogging the dog never hurt anybody

[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:12.060]
And if people did a little more of it, we might say some lies

[02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:14.760]
Hell, if Clinton just stayed home and spanked a monkey

[02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:16.900]
He'd even be in less hot water

[02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:20.300]
Teaching kids about masturbation would be no big deal

[02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:23.020]
We could even take some standard teaching tools

[02:15:23.020 --> 02:15:27.300]
And just twist them around a little bit like C-Dick Run

[02:15:27.300 --> 02:15:29.920]
When you see Dick Run, get to the doctor

[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:32.320]
Because you picked up a bad case of crowdscrickets

[02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:36.720]
Folks, we got to get real about the realities of the world we live in

[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:39.780]
There are too many kids out there taking a baloney ride

[02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:41.940]
And parking there y'all in hair harbor

[02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:45.320]
Now if we just teach them to stay home and paddle the pickle

[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:50.820]
Pump the pythons, walk the door, wax the carrot or tickle the taco

[02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:52.320]
We'd all be better off

[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:54.060]
And that's all I have to say

[02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:58.240]
Now I'm going home now and see if Mr. Elders wants to pop it in the toaster

[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:02.500]
And hail Oyster and buzz the rillow

[02:16:02.500 --> 02:16:03.360]
Hey, where are you going?

[02:16:03.940 --> 02:16:05.200]
Come here, come here, I want to tell you something

[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:08.260]
Oh man, don't you ever take a bath

[02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:09.180]
What are you doing?

[02:16:09.460 --> 02:16:10.700]
Hey, where are you going?

[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:22.200]
Here you go, walk the pole south

[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:24.860]
When I kick it out, I can blow bubble down in my nose

[02:16:24.860 --> 02:16:28.080]
And the foxes' retro-ducing dude

[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:32.700]
I am doing, but I know who's hair in here is our oozing down

[02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:34.240]
Drugs, they look like pets

[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:37.860]
And in fact, that's where we'll make you, you

[02:16:37.860 --> 02:16:40.580]
The kids just look funny

[02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:42.840]
So the rabbi says, now what am I doing?

[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:43.660]
He's getting scared

[02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:47.080]
But everyone's disgusted and scared

[02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:50.000]
Walks through hallway sideways

[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:56.380]
And he's covered with gorilla hair

[02:16:56.940 --> 02:16:59.180]
Mama says he's off there

[02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:02.200]
He's a big handsome young man, please him alone

[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:05.560]
We're not too sure what's going on there

[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:07.940]
Stay away from me

[02:17:10.420 --> 02:17:11.460]
Josh Freeman

[02:17:11.460 --> 02:17:14.700]
Yeah, he'll think he's funny, but he's now standing here

[02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:15.660]
I'm funny, isn't he?

[02:17:15.700 --> 02:17:17.140]
He'll come there, be he

[02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:20.700]
Josh Freeman

[02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:25.180]
He's a big and squeezed his cheese, and if I tell you what, it's solid by the pound

[02:17:25.180 --> 02:17:28.180]
He's a big and squeezed

[02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:31.380]
Got so bad his butt's exploded

[02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:37.960]
Stewing wretched pile all over the roof

[02:17:39.220 --> 02:17:42.620]
There's staples up and down in the roof

[02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:47.320]
Just to hold in all that greasy old food

[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:49.960]
Stay away from me

[02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:53.180]
Josh Freeman

[02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:55.740]
Yeah, you think I care, it's very cool, I don't like me

[02:17:55.740 --> 02:17:57.240]
I think he does

[02:17:57.240 --> 02:17:58.700]
Don't come near me

[02:18:01.660 --> 02:18:02.460]
Josh Freeman

[02:18:02.460 --> 02:18:03.760]
Come here, come here

[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:06.400]
Don't like me, don't let too much roto juice in

[02:18:08.060 --> 02:18:10.380]
There's a thing when someone calls you and it's all over

So, he's looking for a job at ESPN radio, is that what you said?

[02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:15.560]

My record local, this is 5-60

[02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:17.180]
The radio's on your side

[02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:19.480]
Q-A-M

[02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:22.660]
Our David's a bit

[02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:26.420]
Oh!

[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:29.500]
If you cannot find a sum of a bum or rag

[02:19:29.500 --> 02:19:34.140]
If the markets are a drum of bum or rag

[02:19:34.140 --> 02:19:39.480]
If the terrorists are crispy, Pakistan is looking chimney-north Korea

[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:41.420]
Is too risky bum or rag

[02:19:42.220 --> 02:19:45.560]
If we have no allies with the bum or rag

[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:49.560]
If we think that someone's business bum or rag

[02:19:50.220 --> 02:19:54.460]
So to hell with the inspections, let's look up for the elections

[02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:58.180]
Close your mind and take directions bum or rag

Call and find out how the borders bum or rag

[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:06.500]
For our right, it seems like borders bum or rag

[02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:10.500]
If the green will call the trees and let's make more than hope to season

[02:20:10.500 --> 02:20:13.560]
Even if we have no reason for our rag

[02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:18.880]
You won't have to worry about it

[02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:19.320]
You won't have to worry about it

[02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:19.560]

[02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:34.140]
Yeah!

[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:37.060]
Old number 80 is back

[02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:38.920]
Haring up with the greats

[02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:40.660]
Singing more big hits

With even more big stars

[02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:45.680]
The bad dog does them all

[02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:46.480]
Baby!

[02:20:47.140 --> 02:20:49.400]
The killer for taking a rag

[02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:51.240]
I'm tired of it

[02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:53.280]
I'm tired of it

[02:20:53.280 --> 02:20:54.380]
All right!

[02:20:55.060 --> 02:20:57.240]
All right!

[02:20:57.240 --> 02:20:58.080]
All right!

[02:21:03.320 --> 02:21:05.800]
All right!

[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:08.940]
All right!

[02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:10.500]
All right!

[02:21:11.860 --> 02:21:15.140]
It's an all new British invasion

[02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:18.960]
With the mad dog singing like a man

[02:21:21.080 --> 02:21:22.140]
I like it

[02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:24.560]
I like it

[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:26.300]
The truth is finally out

[02:21:26.300 --> 02:21:29.540]
That gym manager was truly the fifth beat of it

[02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:32.540]
You gotta give it a love and give it a love

[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.220]
Everyone loves the land

[02:21:36.220 --> 02:21:40.760]
And now your head's a stain

[02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:44.240]
You always say, we say, don't be all right

[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:47.000]
Don't be all right!

[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:51.080]
Here's the bad dog's enterance

[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:53.020]
I changed the mood to the cake

[02:21:53.020 --> 02:21:56.600]
And you always say, don't be all right!

[02:21:57.380 --> 02:21:58.500]
It's an all right!

[02:21:59.700 --> 02:22:01.160]
It's an all right!

[02:22:03.220 --> 02:22:03.740]
Anyway!

[02:22:06.420 --> 02:22:09.380]
The mad dog was just a little ambivalent

[02:22:09.380 --> 02:22:11.580]
When we asked him if he wanted to do it again

[02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:13.500]
I don't think so

[02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:16.160]
So we had Luke the Gratzie fam a little visit

[02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:20.200]
And tell him either his brains or his signature would wind up on the contrast

[02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:23.200]
That son of a bitch is cute

[02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:26.520]
All right!

[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:29.960]
All right!

[02:22:32.340 --> 02:22:33.940]
All right!

[02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:34.280]

[02:22:34.420 --> 02:22:35.400]
And it's safe!

[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:38.840]
How many do available now if you move quickly?

[02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:40.000]
All right!

[02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:40.840]
I'm ready!

[02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:43.960]
All right!

[02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:45.820]
I'm ready!

[02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:47.820]
All right!

[02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:48.320]
All right!

[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:54.820]
All right!

[02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:02.060]
There we go!

[02:23:07.680 --> 02:23:10.120]
It's gone out of bone

[02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:15.640]
And took a hit in woody act like Cheat and Chum

[02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:20.900]
And get the munchies and make roundly spills with hair

[02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:26.300]
And woody share it with Jesus and the saints

[02:23:26.300 --> 02:23:31.560]
Those highest hotheads and yeah, yeah

[02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:37.100]
Hot is great and yeah, yeah

[02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:44.300]
Hot is good and yeah, yeah, yeah

[02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:47.820]
Hot is God's most cannabis

[02:23:50.300 --> 02:23:55.120]
Mocking hot like one of us

[02:23:55.120 --> 02:23:59.020]
Getting high on the back of the bus

[02:23:59.020 --> 02:24:03.140]
Just him and Moses getting stoned

[02:24:03.140 --> 02:24:04.280]
Are you sure?

[02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:08.220]
On a grey hump us too long

[02:24:08.220 --> 02:24:13.040]
To get some Vatican homegrown

[02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:20.220]
A couple of time backs to take home

[02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:27.880]
Smoke up big Bob Marley on his throne

[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:35.840]
No fun and heaven is your soul

[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:41.600]
Coming up tonight on Inside the Behind the True Hollywood Celebrity Music Vagery Profile Tonight

[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:45.900]
On Inside the Behind the True Hollywood Celebrity Music Vagery Profile Story

[02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:49.620]
We take a good hard stiff look into startup

[02:24:49.620 --> 02:24:54.220]
Their infectious pop stylings infected us with an infection

[02:24:54.220 --> 02:24:57.800]
Until we took some antibiotics and the thing for they went away in a week or so

[02:24:57.800 --> 02:24:59.600]
They were to pow

[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:09.180]
The heart and soul and the soul and the soul and the soul

[02:25:09.180 --> 02:25:12.940]
People are all you're asking us where we got the name to pow

[02:25:12.940 --> 02:25:16.940]
In this weird interview, DePaul leads singer Carol Decker

[02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:22.080]
Makes the rash assumption that we give a flying f*** about her in her stupid band

[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:25.440]
Well, to pow with a character on Star Trek

[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:28.300]
She was a vulcan high priestess

[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:33.680]
Interesting enough, confessing that she named her band after a Star Trek character

[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:40.660]
Brad Pitt Carol Decker is such a hopeless geek that it prevented her from getting laid during her entire tenure as a famous person

[02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:47.300]
It's ironic if you know because as you probably know vulcan path of mate

[02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:50.540]
Who likes every seven years or they like explode

[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:55.540]
Why no Carol, you annoying strange person, we didn't know that

[02:25:55.540 --> 02:26:01.860]
But let me ask you this, if the band to pow doesn't have a hit every seven years, do they explode too

[02:26:01.860 --> 02:26:06.020]
Well, I don't know, I mean like what are you getting at?

[02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:09.960]
I mean we only had that one hit and it's been well worth everything

[02:26:12.660 --> 02:26:16.380]
Ladies and gentlemen, a little glimpse of what the world would be like

[02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:19.160]
If TV show announcers had all the power

[02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:24.900]
It's a big juicy, shopping-wet-looking show business tonight on Inside the Mind

[02:26:53.420 --> 02:27:01.800]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:09.140]
Not that I'm minded but I'm way too old I fantasize about being in bed

[02:27:09.980 --> 02:27:17.000]
In a twist with feet lull my man friend did it I'll kiss and make up with generous up day

[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:25.220]
And then ask him to break my pun No, very no, very again

[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:33.560]
Though I would not feel the most old Now and I would not be ashamed

[02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:41.460]
About a ginger and more gay union Just bold and then stroken away

[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:50.300]
Boy, baby, kill me you're not my guy Yeah, sounds like a nine-year-old kid

[02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:51.460]
Eeeh!

[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:55.260]
Only a macho-manly guy You don't know me

[02:27:55.260 --> 02:27:57.860]

Oh.

I'm so scared when I finally have to leave home.

[02:36:36.180 --> 02:36:38.260]
But she will never love me.

[02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:39.140]
I'm so scared.

[02:36:43.900 --> 02:36:45.680]
All the dice.

[02:36:51.260 --> 02:36:52.780]
All the dice.

[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:54.620]

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:10.360]
You can't let go.

[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:12.540]
You can't let go.

[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:16.260]
I'm beautiful.

[02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:20.380]

I'm beautiful.

[02:37:30.700 --> 02:37:36.100]
That night when she turned off all the lights.

[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:40.200]
There's no place where she could hide.

[02:37:41.260 --> 02:37:41.760]
Oh no.

[02:37:42.700 --> 02:37:44.120]

Oh, she went out to kill her.

[02:37:58.580 --> 02:38:00.040]
That night.

[02:38:02.740 --> 02:38:07.280]
One day, the jury's gonna set free.

[02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:16.540]
Oh, she's gonna get down.

[02:38:16.540 --> 02:38:16.540]

[02:38:16.540 --> 02:38:16.540]

[02:38:19.140 --> 02:38:20.460]
It's true.

[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:23.020]
Oh, she's gonna get down.

[02:38:23.020 --> 02:38:23.020]

[02:38:28.980 --> 02:38:37.980]
Oh, she's gonna get you.

[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:40.140]
Oh, she's gonna get you.

[02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:42.300]
She's gonna get you.

[02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:45.580]
Oh, she's gonna get you.

[02:38:45.580 --> 02:38:46.400]
Oh, she's gonna get you.

[02:38:48.020 --> 02:38:48.460]
One night.

[02:38:50.780 --> 02:38:52.520]
Okay, okay.

[02:38:54.680 --> 02:38:55.480]
OJ! OJ!

[02:38:55.480 --> 02:39:02.780]
You killed the school, you killed the school, OJ! OJ! OJ! OJ! OJ!

[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:07.360]
YOU KILLED THE CALL, YOU KILLED THE CALL, OJ!

[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:14.960]

[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:21.060]

Oh, she's gonna get you!

[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:36.980]
Tonight!

[02:39:39.700 --> 02:39:44.940]
And now, the sound of Pamela Lee, breastfeeding, on the

[02:39:44.940 --> 02:39:46.280]
set of Baywatch.

[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:53.000]
Oh, this is good.

[02:39:53.880 --> 02:39:55.380]
This is good stuff, Pamela.

[02:39:59.180 --> 02:40:03.080]
So, for the 22-1560 WQA.

[02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:05.940]
Were you saying that or were you saying that?

[02:40:06.220 --> 02:40:09.080]
That's what I thought you'd told about that disease,

[02:40:09.660 --> 02:40:11.580]
phony synthetic boob bitch.

[02:40:12.980 --> 02:40:15.480]
Anyway, this poll today, I think it was doomed from the beginning.

[02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:17.460]
Well, it was death.

[02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:19.720]
That's a good point.

[02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:20.460]
It was a death poll.

[02:40:20.580 --> 02:40:22.400]
I think it was DOA, baby.

[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:26.400]
Who do you think will be the next celebrity to die?

[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:28.920]
And it just, I mean, there is one or two things or both.

[02:40:29.060 --> 02:40:31.180]
Either it was a bad poll, a bad idea in a first place,

[02:40:31.420 --> 02:40:35.120]
or the fact that we did it around that Carlos and Eric did it around.

[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:36.060]
Wasn't it Carlos?

[02:40:37.180 --> 02:40:37.540]
Sorry.

[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:41.440]
Bob Hope 160, Robert Reagan 91.

[02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:44.000]
And after that, it's like, you know, maybe that's part of the problem.

[02:40:44.340 --> 02:40:45.680]
Hope John Paul the tooth has got 35.

[02:40:45.900 --> 02:40:46.960]
He's not looking too good.

[02:40:47.580 --> 02:40:48.380]
That's what I voted for.

[02:40:48.820 --> 02:40:51.620]
Mo, Mo Howard David in 30, the O'Rive just 22.

[02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:52.820]
Mo, you're pulling ahead of me, baby.

[02:40:52.980 --> 02:40:54.360]
Although I have to today, I'm not too sure.

[02:40:54.780 --> 02:40:58.500]
Don I miss 15, Strom Thurman 15, and Jerry Lewis has 10.

[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:01.780]
Although, I think they're underestimating his abilities, you know?

[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:02.180]
Yeah.

[02:41:03.380 --> 02:41:06.460]
There are some communities in America that are not as big as his head.

[02:41:06.460 --> 02:41:08.120]
In fact, that'd be a good poll question.

[02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:11.580]
Who's got the bigger head? Joe Rose, a Jerry Lewis or the Beast.

[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:19.080]

And it's only from KTL.

[02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:28.260]
You can tell it's KTL.

[02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:28.980]
We go.

[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:41.840]
So we were out on our first date.

[02:44:42.420 --> 02:44:45.880]
After eating at a Mexican cafe.

[02:44:47.620 --> 02:44:50.360]
While we were driving in my car.

[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:54.400]
She let one go that almost blew up both the way.

[02:44:56.160 --> 02:44:58.820]
I have to get you cut that cheese.

[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:00.800]
Then she turned around.

[02:45:01.340 --> 02:45:04.360]
You look at me and said, girl, no part.

[02:45:05.300 --> 02:45:07.080]
Girl, no part.

[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:10.060]
You can tell it's a girl, no part.

[02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:11.800]
But I do.

[02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:16.040]
The older her, the eighties.

[02:45:16.300 --> 02:45:18.320]
They're like closing in my hair.

[02:45:19.260 --> 02:45:22.060]
And so I rolled the windows down.

[02:45:22.340 --> 02:45:24.140]
So I could get some air.

[02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:27.160]
It felt like something died in there.

[02:45:29.720 --> 02:45:31.180]
Girl, no part.

[02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:33.980]
Girl, no part.

[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:37.020]
She kept telling me that girl's no part.

[02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:38.620]
But I do.

[02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:44.180]
I heard another deadly squirt.

[02:45:44.540 --> 02:45:48.220]
Then I held my nose and covered it with my shirt.

[02:45:50.060 --> 02:45:52.680]
I turned around to get her back.

[02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:54.780]
With just a matter of time.

[02:45:55.160 --> 02:45:56.880]
People are another attack.

[02:45:58.980 --> 02:46:01.180]
So I asked if she was okay.

[02:46:01.820 --> 02:46:03.100]
Let's see the bad thing.

[02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:06.720]
And I also had to say, was girl's no part.

[02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:09.500]
Girl, no part.

[02:46:09.660 --> 02:46:12.900]
Girl, no part.

[02:46:12.940 --> 02:46:14.180]
But I do.

[02:46:17.340 --> 02:46:19.560]
Girl, no part.

[02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:22.400]
Girl, no part.

[02:46:22.700 --> 02:46:29.940]
But I do.

[02:46:31.700 --> 02:46:32.700]
But I do.

[02:46:37.180 --> 02:46:39.460]
Girl, no part.

[02:46:39.460 --> 02:46:39.500]
Girl, no part.

[02:46:39.500 --> 02:46:39.500]

[02:46:39.500 --> 02:46:39.660]

On the years in this thinking business.

As you have been changed a bit.

[02:50:50.780 --> 02:50:55.620]
Even though you had to paint their s**t.

[02:50:56.400 --> 02:50:58.820]
From PD to GM's.

And you see our ratings for the last book.

[02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:30.140]
Yeah, I know what that is.

[02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:31.860]
You're a good professional.

[02:51:32.100 --> 02:51:32.340]

[02:51:33.220 --> 02:51:34.240]
Watch your backs.

Watch your back.

[02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:41.380]
Where you want away from home?

[02:51:42.060 --> 02:51:44.520]
I thought.

[02:51:44.900 --> 02:51:48.380]
I don't need a latency.

[02:51:50.280 --> 02:51:53.380]
Then the sun does not wake up a little.

[02:51:53.380 --> 02:51:55.460]
I don't know how to hunt a guest you ma'am.

[02:51:55.460 --> 02:51:56.880]
A rulset guts to go.

[02:51:57.460 --> 02:51:59.640]
That is a lot of fat producers you know.

You won't wait for most of all.

[02:52:11.140 --> 02:52:13.640]
Oh, brother, all that glove I don't understand.

[02:52:14.240 --> 02:52:16.620]
You can eat from a trough while using both hands.

[02:52:16.940 --> 02:52:19.440]
That thing's that touch you made a rating school.

[02:52:19.920 --> 02:52:22.180]

This is what we said.

[02:52:38.860 --> 02:52:39.700]
You can get back, that's right.

[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:41.780]
You won't wait for most of all.

[02:52:41.780 --> 02:52:43.780]

Who I am?

[02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:52.080]
You got extra here.

[02:52:52.640 --> 02:52:54.020]
And I want more time in your arms.

[02:52:54.180 --> 02:52:54.780]

[02:52:55.260 --> 02:52:57.540]
Thank you, some of them.

[02:52:57.540 --> 02:53:01.540]

By the scrotum.

[02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:09.460]
Never really showed up.

[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:14.100]
All my poison and my forehead.

[02:53:15.460 --> 02:53:17.260]
Oh, now they're cooked.

[02:53:18.260 --> 02:53:20.220]
Never locked under my bed.

[02:53:20.640 --> 02:53:22.800]
Oh, thank you.

[02:53:23.560 --> 02:53:27.400]
I got the factory bacon and fresh nooks and kitties.

[02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:28.480]
Backpacks.

[02:53:28.640 --> 02:53:31.400]
There's no way you'll make me dead.

[02:53:32.200 --> 02:53:33.800]
Hey, corn and powel.

[02:53:34.220 --> 02:53:36.820]
Should've locked under the cow or on my hand.

[02:53:38.500 --> 02:53:41.620]
God, favor, sing along with me because this is unbelievable.

[02:53:42.400 --> 02:53:47.300]
I've got the United States going crazy trying to convince people to attack me.

[02:53:47.620 --> 02:53:50.240]
Except for Sean Conn of course, who's on my side.

[02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:52.680]
He loves me like crazy.

[02:53:53.420 --> 02:53:54.300]
Funny little cook.

[02:53:56.020 --> 02:54:01.180]
Who'll get used to a life of hard knocks when I give you the small pops?

[02:54:01.640 --> 02:54:04.360]
You should've locked a little harder.

[02:54:05.880 --> 02:54:06.660]
Silly boss.

[02:54:07.420 --> 02:54:09.560]
Kiss the touch of this murderer.

[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:10.280]
Welcome.

[02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:11.680]
Thank you very much.

[02:54:12.260 --> 02:54:13.900]
Please, chip your weight as a waiter.

[02:54:14.500 --> 02:54:15.460]
Good night.

[02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:21.240]
In the shocking season finale, Evan Marriott, aka Joe Millionaire,

[02:54:21.240 --> 02:54:25.000]
made his final decision and selected Zora to be his beloved.

[02:54:25.460 --> 02:54:26.840]
Then the twist.

[02:54:27.320 --> 02:54:31.200]
The Butler-Paul Hogan presented a couple with a check for $1 million.

[02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:33.980]
But that's not the end of it.

[02:54:34.180 --> 02:54:35.540]
There's another twist.

[02:54:35.760 --> 02:54:37.720]
Not revealed on national television.

[02:54:38.060 --> 02:54:42.260]
The million dollars given to the couple actually belonged to a Colombian drug cartel.

[02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:43.800]
And they want it back.

[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:44.720]
Cheekle.

[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:45.400]
Yes, that's it.

[02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:46.620]
Where's my million dollars?

[02:54:47.060 --> 02:54:48.480]
Met that bitch she has it.

[02:54:48.660 --> 02:54:49.440]
One rich cute.

[02:54:49.440 --> 02:54:51.160]
It's your millionaire.

[02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:51.620]
Who?

[02:54:52.020 --> 02:54:53.340]
Joe Millionaire.

[02:54:53.480 --> 02:54:54.520]
You still from me?

[02:54:54.680 --> 02:54:54.900]
Yes.

[02:54:54.980 --> 02:54:55.440]
From me?

[02:54:55.560 --> 02:54:55.720]
Yes.

[02:54:56.320 --> 02:54:57.580]
Are you kidding me?

[02:54:57.820 --> 02:55:00.080]
No, I want that money back, Cheekle.

[02:55:00.500 --> 02:55:01.580]
Am I gonna get it back?

[02:55:01.760 --> 02:55:03.300]
Cut his throat, Cheekle.

[02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:04.160]
The whole throat?

[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:05.480]
And nothing but the throat.

[02:55:05.820 --> 02:55:06.400]
So, how have we got?

[02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:08.560]
Evan and Zora are running for their lives.

[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:10.140]
But that's not the end of it.

[02:55:10.240 --> 02:55:11.440]
There's another twist.

[02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:16.900]
The money the fox stole from the Colombian drug cartel was apparently stolen originally from a Jamaican crime syndicate.

[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:18.460]
And they wanted back.

[02:55:18.860 --> 02:55:20.520]
Zigi mo'er's the money mug.

[02:55:20.740 --> 02:55:22.420]
And Joe Millionaire got him on.

[02:55:22.520 --> 02:55:25.600]
And a minute, we gave it to the Colombian drug cartel as our own man.

[02:55:25.860 --> 02:55:26.760]
Get it back from them.

[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:28.420]
The millionaire can't got it.

[02:55:28.660 --> 02:55:29.620]
From the TV show.

[02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:30.240]
Yeah.

[02:55:30.700 --> 02:55:32.900]
What's the kid doing with my million dollars?

[02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:33.940]
Your bomb for God, man.

[02:55:34.140 --> 02:55:37.080]
Well, he fell in love with Zora, son of a million dollars.

[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:38.160]
Tell me about that, man.

[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:39.700]
I'm going to get the money back, man.

[02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:40.840]
I've got weed to make.

[02:55:41.220 --> 02:55:41.560]
Okay.

[02:55:41.980 --> 02:55:42.840]
Cut his throat, man.

[02:55:43.140 --> 02:55:43.640]
The whole throat?

[02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:44.820]
And nothing but the throat.

[02:55:45.100 --> 02:55:45.760]
So, how have we got?

[02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:46.420]
But wait.

[02:55:46.740 --> 02:55:47.740]
There's another twist.

[02:55:47.740 --> 02:55:51.000]
Evan and Zora are really brother and sister.

[02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:53.320]
Eeeeee.

[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:55.160]
But not just any brother and sister.

[02:55:55.380 --> 02:55:56.300]
What a twist.

[02:55:57.140 --> 02:55:58.140]
We're the osman.

[02:55:58.620 --> 02:55:59.360]
I'm the little baby.

[02:55:59.480 --> 02:55:59.740]
Joe Millionaire.

[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:01.220]
Get her alive.

[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:02.320]
I'm fucked.

[02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:03.120]
All right.

[02:56:03.300 --> 02:56:05.400]
I love it. That's the first time I noticed Bumbaclod in that bit.

[02:56:05.620 --> 02:56:06.260]
I mean, me too.

[02:56:07.620 --> 02:56:08.260]
167 votes.

[02:56:08.380 --> 02:56:09.520]
That's why I played thanks for the memories.

[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:10.760]
That's the only Bob Hope that we got.

[02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:14.860]
167 say Bob hopes Kroke and next Ronnie Reagan's out his ass with 96.

[02:56:15.100 --> 02:56:15.900]
Bye, bye, bye.

[02:56:15.900 --> 02:56:18.900]
Send me the lucky show on 560s on NQAN.

[02:56:19.660 --> 02:56:20.620]
Miami for learning.

[02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:21.680]
Fuck third, man.
