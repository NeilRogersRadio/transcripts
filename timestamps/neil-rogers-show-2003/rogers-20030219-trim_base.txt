[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]
Neil, my queen, God!

[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.940]
Last night I dreamt of Canzaco

[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.020]
Just like he never let my side at all

[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.200]
I'd wait with Obey Canzaco

[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.020]
He showed me just how to handle the ball

[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.120]
I showed Jose how to vote

[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.400]
So Cancaco breath was kind of vote

[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.260]
I took off my clothes

[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260]
He kept on his pleads eyes

[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.360]
I miss coming round through bass

[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.740]
And sliding into his face

[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.600]
Get the shower with Jose

[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.940]
My Spanish lullaby

[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.960]
I'll just scum back and jump forward

[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.200]
We got some leash from where I showed him the full little time

[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.900]
We got our fountain votes by the way, boy

[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.000]
But you're like that

[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.840]
I like it

[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.660]
Aren't you impressed?

[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.800]
I know what at 560 WQM Happy Wednesday

[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.880]
It's our Wednesday noon to 1 hour coming up

[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.160]
The Accommodi-Pen-Hour-Do-One

[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.740]
Aren't you thrilled with that?

[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.340]
Always

[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.320]
I know, I'm sure

[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.720]
I'm making a pretty good recovery from my little TIA

[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.680]
My minor stroke

[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.260]
Then nobody seems to understand too much about it

[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.320]
I guess if you never had one and probably don't want to

[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.780]
Believe me

[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.200]
No thanks

[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.400]
But I don't have one

[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.400]
How's the Humber doing?

[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.480]
We're getting the updates on him

[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.700]
I heard him yesterday afternoon

[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.660]
And he sounded like

[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.440]
What have I told you about him?

[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.180]
Very concerned on this part over here about the Humber

[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.480]
He sounds bad

[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.360]
Then I tuned in a little later

[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.360]
And I heard Josh Clarence Dero

[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.020]
And the beast talking about sounding bad

[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.160]
I heard them fillin' a hank of gone homesick

[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.880]
Can I just give you two words of advice?

[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.980]
Okay

[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.360]
Even though this audience rebels and doesn't want to hear it

[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.380]
Because they can't stand the truth

[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.400]
Two words of advice

[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.800]
Fat kills

[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.000]
Okay?

[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.900]
In other words

[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.220]
To make a long story short

[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.820]
Cut the crap

[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.800]
That's what we're going to talk about candy and sweets today

[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.040]
A little later on

[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.680]
Rogers, almond brittle

[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.520]
That's the brand

[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.760]
I guess pretty hard for me to think of a name like

[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.480]
No, God

[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.100]
Yeah, Rogers

[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.580]
Everything is Rogers, Rogers, cable, Rogers, candy

[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.400]
No, God

[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.640]
Rogers, but I'm assuming it's their real name

[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.000]
Former Major League slugger Jose Conzaco was sent to jail

[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.560]
Yes, today for violating his probation for a 2001 nightclub brawl

[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.800]
Can Seco 38 could be held until a March 17 hearing judge Leonard Glick rule

[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.340]
I wonder if he's kind of Larry Glick, do you think?

[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.500]
Who?

[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.060]
The judges should arrest warrant after being told

[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.380]
Can Seco failed to start anger control classes and community service

[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.980]
And had left Florida for longer than 30 days

[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.120]
Which were among the conditions of his probation

[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.080]
Yadi, yadi, yadi

[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.780]
I understand that I have to take responsibility

[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.860]
Can Succo said

[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.080]
I ask for the mercy and understanding of the court

[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.100]
He had some issues

[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.180]
He had some aircraft to take care of in California

[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.340]
But the banjo on his knee

[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.500]
Do we have to see Keith Obergman anymore?

[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.820]
No, please

[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.200]
If ever you talk about a guy that keeps resurfacing like a bad penny

[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.740]
I'm watching MSNBC yesterday afternoon, you want to know why?

[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.440]
I give up

[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.320]
Somebody has to

[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.460]
Oh, okay

[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.880]
And I'm watching there and it's when that fat jury knockman, that fathead guy is usually on between five and six

[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.160]
And I'm ready to turn the dial and they got the guest on there

[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.520]
Peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, a rack attack, a rack, you know

[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.200]
And it goes back and there's Keith Obergman again

[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.140]
Back to the scene of the crime again

[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.140]
Good God

[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.040]
This is a guy that used to be on CNN

[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.620]
ESPN

[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.620]
MSNBC first time

[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.680]
Fox News, Fox Sports

[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.640]
Everywhere to it

[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.160]
And this guy is like in his own mind legendary

[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.800]
He'd really pontificates and he talks in a very deep voice

[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.720]
And he has that serious look on his face

[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.160]
Like he really has something to say

[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.920]
And he was like, he doesn't

[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.200]
And you want to know why?

[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.780]
I give up

[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.600]
The proof of the fact he's got enough to say is he's a sports nerd basically

[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.620]
That's his background

[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.140]
Anybody that was ever on ESPN

[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.800]
I mean, they'll all do respect to the Humper

[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.600]
I mean, you know, don't really have a lot to see on MSNBC

[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.020]
So he's back on there again now filling in for a fathead

[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.540]
God

[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.380]
So like I said, we have no updates, we know my dog will be back today at one

[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.420]
We're glad he'll be back

[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.060]
And we think Hank will be back at three

[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.280]
But I'm serious, wasn't I the one to tell you?

[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.820]
Yes, sir

[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.140]
Not one of those people that's afraid to tell it like it is

[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.880]
Because I'm afraid I'm going to hurt somebody's feelings

[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.740]
Because you know, if somebody looks really bad or they're too fat

[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.620]
Somebody's got to say something like, you know, put down to them crispy cream

[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.620]
Do something or you could just watch him die

[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.500]
No, I don't want to do that

[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.680]
Now see, one of Hank's problems

[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.920]
I think his biggest problem is he's a schmuzer

[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.080]
You know what I mean? He likes, said, you know, I don't knock it

[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.580]
He likes going out to dinners with all his sports buddies

[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.560]
And they all come into town where he goes on the road

[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.580]
And that's his thing

[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.100]
So that makes it extra hard, how does it, somebody like that can lose weight

[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.820]
But the last time that I saw him, which was early January, man, he had just ballooned to...

[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.020]
Epic proportions, I mean, just enormous

[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.940]
Was that my imagination or my correct?

[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.920]
I didn't see him

[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.980]
Oh, see, that's a cop out again

[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.520]
Just know the cop out

[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.560]
What, Hank? Is that, and he's going to die, that's not a cop out

[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.960]
Well, that's nice, that's very nice

[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.400]
Don't we want to do something to try to destroy it?

[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.580]
We would get to, but just like Mama Cass put down a sandwich

[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.500]
I've gone through it before, you know, Gordish-Telton

[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.580]
I understand

[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.420]
But having just gone through this little minor stroke which is my last awakening, my last warning, that's it for me

[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.700]
That was my last chance

[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.900]
Next one, it's going to be...

[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.520]
Oh, I see

[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.000]
Canito, baby, I'm telling you that right now

[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.360]
Our poll yesterday, in fact, should we do the poll today first, be kind of a dismission that's going to be my last?

[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.380]
Or should we take this...

[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.660]
Huh?

[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.740]
What do I just do?

[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.100]
Yeah, but why was it still on there?

[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.620]
I was going to take a saw-line touring and McCarlis is so quick today, he was like, way ahead of me

[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.760]
Miami, when is this?

[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.160]
Hello

[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.140]
Yes, sir

[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.520]
How are you doing, you know?

[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.820]
Okay

[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.460]
Listen, I know that we're talking about Hank, the Humper

[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.360]
Yeah

[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.400]
You saw the movie, Austin Powers, don't remember?

[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.460]
This guy's looking so humongous, he started really like the bad bastard

[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.420]
Just how they had, they had Humper from now on

[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.640]
The fan-hunter, okay

[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.080]
See, this guy's making a joke out of it, it's no joke in matter, mister

[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.280]
It's no joke in matter

[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:09.060]
We're talking about bursting at the seams, we're talking about he could barely talk when I heard me yesterday, when I was down there last time and he was on

[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.640]
I heard him barely squeaking his way through the show

[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.480]
You know what happens when you get fat?

[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.460]
You die?

[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.820]
All year about first before that happens, all your dead, various systems start giving out

[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.160]
Right?

[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.540]
They have to cut your feet off

[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.400]
Here's our poll question today, which fits right in, who would be the happiest of Neil Croaked?

[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.680]
Here are your choices, we've got six, I think pretty good choices, didn't put Carlos on there because I can't think of a reason

[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.600]
Yet

[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.160]
George, here's the choices, George thinks he'd get the show

[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.220]
Eric, no more long polls

[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.360]
Greg Reed, a real evil doer

[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.720]
Oh, he is really

[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.640]
In fact, I definitely give him part of the credit for my stroke, and I take most of the blame myself, being fat out of shapes

[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.900]
Sit on my ass down there, being there for seven weeks, which I should know better

[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:05.200]
Moe Howard David would dance on Neil's grave, Dennis the chronic professional Catholic homophob, or Geldie just out of spite

[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:11.160]
Those things are pretty good list, it's an excellent list, but I think Moe would probably do more than just dance on your grave

[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.060]
Yeah, what we do, like pee on it, and then we drop a lot

[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.640]
Can't be drop a steamy log on it

[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.060]
Here you go, Ginger

[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.360]
Rogers, almond brittle, I'm going to tell you before you die, now you know a peanut brittle is obviously

[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:31.220]
Oh, yeah, now this is very similar, but it's almond brittle as opposed to peanut brittle, and it's surrounded by thick chocolate

[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.920]
Oh, good God, you have never lived until you

[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.300]
Now see here I am on a one breath, I'm talking about on a verge of death, but on the other hand I'm also turning people onto something really good

[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.100]
Which they're not going to be able to find, because I'm sure the Rogers candies are not sold in the US of A

[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.940]
Maybe Nestle's turtleneck, maybe that woman will call him again the one that I bitched out, but I doubt it, because she and her son are very pissed off with me

[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.680]
They hit me like poison, too bad, too bad

[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:02.000]
In fact, wasn't that a day I was talking about being tired of all these people like that bitch they used to bring into smarties

[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.640]
At the hockey games all the time, at League of Toronto, I hope I run into her out on the street, although I wouldn't recognize her

[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.800]
Maybe she'll recognize me, oh Neal, I'm the one who used to bring into smarties at the game, I'll kick her ass right on the goddamn ground

[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.200]
Right on the goddamn snowbank, you heard her run into her with your car?

[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.680]
I don't have a car

[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.880]
They don't blame me, don't blame me for subsidizing terrorism, I'm not driving SUV like George and some other people

[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.540]
I'm not driving anything except my feet

[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.380]
Since I have no vehicle here, I don't need one, I don't want one, I don't want to drive

[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:33.560]
It's one another thing I don't miss, is driving, obviously after the experience I'm always done there driving with

[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.720]
But a little crazy people, I'm telling you man most of you people on the roads were listening to me right now

[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.340]
Please do everybody else and yourself a big favor, pull over to the side of the road

[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.680]
Okay, just take the keys and drop them in a storm sewer or something

[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:54.480]
Put them in a dumpster and walk home or take a cab or do something, get off the freaking road, got all mighty

[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.340]
What passes in the name and I don't care what anybody says

[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:02.280]
Yeah, there are people that go way too fast and some of the punks they want to go like 90 and a 60 or whatever

[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.820]
But the fact of the matter is the slow drivers are the ones who wind up killing all of us sooner or later

[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.920]
The slow, I told you about that little mini caravan of about a half a dozen cars who are following each other

[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.980]
Oldie enters in the pomp and a part of that one, I thought I was going to have apoplex you run in the street

[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.340]
In fact, maybe they caused my stroke

[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.720]
You bastards caused my stroke, you assholes, you old farts

[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.200]
Oi, man

[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.840]
I thought I looked at the cars they're just like all lost and they're like looking at each other out the window

[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.300]
I thought this is the ultimate jujamm right here

[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.600]
What the hell was that all about?

[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.480]
Here is our poll from yesterday

[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.360]
What was the most erotic movie not x-rated that you've ever seen?

[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.400]
Two horse race strictly, body heat, 135

[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.300]
Would you agree with that?

[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.080]
With body heat, yeah

[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.580]
Well, see I haven't got to the other one yet, why do you want to be such a prick?

[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.960]
You know, why do you want to be so argumentative?

[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.060]
I can't wait to be a prick

[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.160]
Nine and a half weeks, 126, that's the one you're not buying

[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:06.640]
And it's interesting because when I mentioned you that they be four on Monday that I was thinking about doing this follow-up movie poll yesterday

[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.880]
You said nine and a half weeks ago that's how to vote

[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.180]
And so it gets a ton of votes and then you turn around and say, well that's only because they want to be contrary

[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.160]
No, nothing because they want to be contrary

[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.420]
They're just not as repulsed by Mickey Rorck as the rest of humanity

[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.300]
Well, he's nauseating but again they don't care about who the guy is in the movie

[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.600]
I tried to explain that to you

[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]
We have this large-hunching, her male heterosexual audience

[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.940]
And they don't care whether it's Ron Jeremy, Mickey Rorck, Mickey Rooney or Mickey Mouse

[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.500]
I'm just telling you the way it is

[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.200]
In fact it probably could be Mickey Mouse

[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:36.940]
Oh, I sure

[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.000]
And they wouldn't give a crap

[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.440]
Anyway, so nine and a half weeks had 126

[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.980]
And that was it because from there it's way down to wild things with 50

[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.500]
And we've all seen a few wild things in our time I would hope

[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.560]
Basic instincts 49, blue lagoon 46

[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.400]
I'm not going to read all of these, there were a thousand votes and so many in single digits

[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.420]
Wild-worked 36, Monsters, Balls 35

[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.340]
Fatal attraction 34, see there's another example

[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.260]
They didn't care that Michael Douglas was the guy in there

[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.860]
Who's about a 60s of food fly but fancies himself a real sex spot

[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.120]
You know, those are the guys that really get me

[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.000]
Like Ron Jeremy and Randy West, there are two more

[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.480]
Maybe Randy West a hundred years ago in another lifetime on another planet

[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.120]
By the way, good small girl last night

[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.360]
Good to see that mama Kent and Clark are okay, mama Kent

[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.380]
Boogie notes had 28 speaking of that

[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.580]
I guess it must have been the package that sealed the deal

[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.420]
On Faithful 27 the postman always rings twice 24

[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.480]
Mahal Holland Drive 24 which we're still trying to figure that out

[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.980]
Very spooky

[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:39.680]
Cruel intentions 21, two moon jussian 20 Lolita head 20, bound 20

[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.940]
Which I guess Muffo is there and you were talking about bound

[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.500]
Do you say something about how he likes being gagged and bound?

[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.920]
Summer of 42 18

[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.580]
In fact, he'd look Muffo would look at the red rubber ball

[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.860]
Like the Hannibal Lecter, Mask on with the red rubber ball

[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:58.920]
Summer of 42 18, Body Double 17, Showgirl 16, Angel Heart 14

[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.760]
1 million years BC 13, Sirens, Chocolate, Sex Lives Video Tape

[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.820]
Summer lovers each had 12 and 10

[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.520]
The other ones in double digits, Sailor who fell from grace with a sea and color of night

[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.000]
That's it, the other one single digits small potatoes

[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.780]
Like George

[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.280]
That's the end of our movie stuff for the time being okay

[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.500]
I'm sure other people will call in and try to vuggus with stuff

[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.840]
And you know what we didn't care

[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.240]
Because obviously what QM is degenerated into as far as the colors are concerned is

[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.280]
Lists, did I mention this several weeks ago?

[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.220]
Yep, that's what they want to talk about

[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.400]
Lists, lists of stuff

[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.780]
Oh yeah, well how about, how about yesterday they were still to the pool from my Monday

[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.100]
Well how about most bizarre?

[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.480]
Let me just ask you one thing

[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.840]
Alright, Paper or Plastic

[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.980]
913 at 560, why do you think about that?

[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.640]
You know our good friends at Dalam actress by now

[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.660]
We talk about all the time

Well Dalam actress is the only smart place to go

[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.400]
Put the best prices on brand name mattresses with the top brand customer service industry

[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.800]
Well this week the deals are even better

[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.560]
Because the big blizzard hits the northeast

[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.420]
And all the president's day sales were snowed out

[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.540]
Because of the storm, Dalam actress has redirected major shipments of

[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.860]

Ladies and gentlemen, have I got karaoke cafe presents?

[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.240]
The other way, thank you!

[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:17.800]
I've got the UN, finest grown-up, never really showed up

[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:24.220]
All my poison and my war head

[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:29.320]
Now they're cooked, never locked under my bed

[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:36.800]
I got the factory make an anthrax noobs in kitties backpacks

[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.100]
There's no way you'll make me dead

[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.840]
Hey, call it pow-o, shut a lock under the tower on my head

[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:51.160]
God, people sing along with me because this is unbelievable, huh?

[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.460]
I've got the United States going crazy trying to convince people to attack me

[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.280]
Except for Sean Pan, of course, who's on my side

[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:03.380]
He loves me like crazy, funny little cook

[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:09.960]
Who'll get used to a life of hard knocks when I give you the smallpox

[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.340]
You should've locked a little harder

[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.600]
Silly boss, kiss the cost of this murderer

[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.720]
Thank you very much!

[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.800]
Welcome, please, keep your weight as your weight as your ship is

[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.040]
Goddamn it!

[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.880]
9.19 at 5.60 WDQM, I love that

[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.840]
14 quick votes, the poll is up there now

[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.420]
Now, let me just say this before we start, I left two out

[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.120]
Oh no!

[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.520]
Oh, we'll have to add these on, Eric

[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.920]
Fox News Heather

[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.640]
And John Gibson of Fox News

[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.420]
Don't you think those two are appropriate?

[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.060]
Sure, I think they get a vote or two or three

[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.540]
Pictures death link to a fedron at M. We tell the audience yesterday and we did not

[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.260]
I chanced high as the mole-meister for jumping the gun and I still say the same thing

[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.800]
Until after the autopsy, what's the big rush to judge me?

[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.300]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.080]
Yeah

[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:01.740]
Mr. Noncommittal?

[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:02.760]
Well, what do you know about it?

[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.600]
You know anything about sports?

[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.200]
Any of Baltimore Orioles, Pictures, Steve Beckler's death is to at least

[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.680]
partly to the dietary supplement of Fedra.

[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.080]
He was taken three, was popping three of them a day

[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.060]
And even it was only anyone degrees here, it was on an empty stomach

[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.120]
You had the heat stroke, as Oregon started falling apart one by one

[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.220]
It couldn't save them 23 years old, he's dead

[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.140]
Second baseball player to die suddenly in the past year, last season Cardinals

[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.120]
pitcher Daryl Kyle 33, died in his sleep, while in Chicago for a game against

[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.980]
The Cubs and autopsy revealed he had severe arterial blockage

[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.680]
You know what you get, I mean not necessarily, sometimes it can be genetic

[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.280]
But you know generally what you get severe arterial blockage from?

[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.760]
Fat, eat food, eat in crap

[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.500]
Eating crap, now let's talk about candy

[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.540]
Man, you're a bastard, Neil, yes I am, I want to live up to my building

[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.420]
I don't want to let anybody down

[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.400]
How's that cold coming so far, by the way boy?

[00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.760]
Now what I was going to say is I thought, now especially since we got Ding Dong

[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.020]
Schooler in the morning, we got Duffinc clearance holding the morning guy's hand every morning

[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.860]
And you don't listen but I will say this, I think that shows Darnes sound a little bit better lately

[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.100]
They've actually got something going on, they've got something to say

[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.600]
And of course again it's a list and they get a lot of calls that way just like we did with the movies

[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.180]
But that's okay

[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.780]
And it's starting to sound like almost a real radio show I would say

[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:26.020]
Now maybe I'm wrong and maybe the audience obviously doesn't agree because the hot, not that it changes anything on a personal level

[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.220]
Because that's never going to change

[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.740]
And we were still dealing with a devious, hostile, nasty, miserable old coot

[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.100]
But the fact of the matter is as far as the show sounds

[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.060]
You see what I'm saying? Well, I'll take your word for it

[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.940]
No, no, no, no, no, no, the Scarlo's think

[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.660]
Yeah, he listens every morning

[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.900]
He later said they started doing the lists and now that's the way that kind of question it's gotten better

[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:47.840]
Did you say great?

[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.720]
No, I didn't say great

[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.920]
Take off those checkered pants

[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.560]
Yeah, cut it out, wait a second

[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.200]
So it is sounding better, no, it's not my imagination

[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.720]
There's actually like a little float of it now that they got somebody in there to hold their hand and give them some direction

[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.400]
I'd like to give them a direction like right out the door

[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.480]
But anyway, 27 votes on a poll

[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.160]
Who'd be the happiest if Neil croaked?

[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.260]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.420]
Moe Howard David had with Danza and Neil's grave 18 out of 27

[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.880]
That's not nice, I got 22 in line

[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.320]
Oh, your vera has changed

[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.300]
Yeah, how come you're getting the faster number?

[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.920]
It also means it's minus supposed to be the faster pewter, okay, mister?

[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.100]
So I just refreshed mine just to make damn sure I'm not

[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.340]
And now it's just sitting there

[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.800]
I got 26 on mine now

[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.360]
Out of 42, Moe Howard David had 26, 61.9 percent

[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.120]
Then it's the chronic professional Catholic homophobes 6

[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.800]
George thinks he'd get the show of 5

[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.640]
Greg Reed, a real evil doer and that's correct 3

[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.240]
Eric no more long polls 1 and Gildi just had a spite only 1

[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.460]
Don't sell Gildi short, okay?

[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.620]
He's devious and dangerous

[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.420]
Devious, dangerous and squeaky

[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.380]
So somebody faxes us speaking of

[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.660]
Because I know that this audience of all the things in the world that besides hockey

[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:03.420]
The only other thing that they don't want to hear about especially is dieting and losing weight right

[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.580]
But this crowd don't want to hear that

[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:05.580]
Don't paint to me

[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.600]
Right, that's right

[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.740]
Who the hell are you to be talking about being fat?

[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.500]
You cow, you just had another stroke, you're a fat slide, you're talking about

[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.540]
Food all the time?

[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.820]
Well the audience likes hearing about food, they love that

[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.180]
You wait and see today, I'll, you mark my words, okay? Mark my turd, you're a seed

[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.720]
Before I do the thing about Rogers truck that's its Canadian A

[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.380]
So that's a good news, I'm not going to start any epidemic, nobody can blame me

[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.780]
Unless we have some people listening on the internet up here in the Canada somewhere

[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.320]
Or we have the Canadians in town right now you know

[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.540]
Yeah, so they're not going to be able to get it there

[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.940]
No, but when they get home

[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.620]
Although they do sell smarties in South Florida

[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.520]
So I don't know maybe Rogers truck that's are available

[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:47.440]
I still say now it's not a poor question, but I'm just curious what people think

[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.260]
For example, I was thinking yesterday if you were stranded on a desert island

[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:57.980]
And you had only one food that you had an unlimited supply of, you see what I'm saying?

[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.000]
Right, what would you want it to be?

[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.920]
Some people would say like crispy cream dinner

[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.980]
And nobody's going to say like sirloin steak

[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.900]
And you know that's, and when I'm talking about body parts

[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:12.500]
You know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about

[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.580]
But that's not the point, this is just for fun

[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.440]
Okay, that's for fun talk about me

[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.060]
You're talking about me preaching to people, this is just for fun

[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.500]
Are you going to be stranded on a desert island anytime soon?

[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:25.760]
Maybe

[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.580]
Oh, that's right, I forgot where you guys are, I forgot

[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.820]
Once that state falls off from a George Wright

[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.000]
And like kind of floats out there in the middle of Atlantic

[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.800]
In fact, maybe you can have a Florida and Cuba reunion

[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.660]
Kind of like the Moan the Ginger reunion

[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.940]
Since 1885, people from all corners of the world have found their way to Rogers chocolates of Victoria

[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.040]
Victoria BCA

[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.820]
Each has discovered their own reasons, their own private excuses to bring Rogers chocolates home with them

[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.700]
We invite you to use our online catalog

[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.080]
Oh, no!

[00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:01.000]
Oh, no, www.r RogersTrocklets.com, pretty simple and basic, RogersTrocklets.com

[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.760]
During the break, I'm going to go on that thing and see if that almond brittle is on there

[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.140]
I'm serious, you know me with the food

[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.000]
When I tell you something like the Nestleys Turtle, I wasn't joking about that, that was serious business

[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:16.240]
And these almond brittle, I can't even describe how good they are

[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.420]
Addictive is an understatement

[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.260]
So go on to RogersTrocklets.com and check out their website

[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.340]
Maybe order you a few cases and we'll come to your funeral, we'll send you flowers

[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.060]
Here's Big Arnie, Big is writes me a facts on the subject of fat

[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:30.860]
How do you like that?

[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.460]
And let me say it again, I'm very concerned about the Humper, I'm not trying to pick on them like some of the callers are

[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.560]
But it's serious business now, it's reached the point of no return I think

[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.400]
You follow what I'm saying?

[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.240]
I know, but in other words, this is the moment of truth

[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.860]
And we're all of us fat people, I'm not pointing the finger, we're all the same

[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.460]
Oh, I lost a couple ounces of fat rich same thing, you know

[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:57.680]
Always talking about how much we lost, but in the meantime, a couple of weeks later you look at us and looks like somebody stuck a bicycle pump up our ass

[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.600]
Like a big balloon in our puppet, you know?

[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.880]
Exactly what I'm talking about

[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.380]
Wayne Arnold up and down all the time

[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.100]
Wayne Arnold, the human accordion

[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.620]
Great guy, I mean just because your fat does mean you're a nice person, in fact most of the fat people are

[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.560]
I know are very nice people

[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.760]
That's what I'm saying, I don't understand is how can you lose all the weight and then just go ahead and put it back right back up

[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:21.720]
Because it's an illness, it's like saying how can you like stop drinking booze for a week and then all of a sudden when somebody sticks it in front of you

[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.360]
You're drinking it again, it's an illness

[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:29.680]
And if only this goddamn world would look upon it that way instead of pointing fingers at all your fat slob

[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:35.980]
Well, got a problem, man, we got a food problem, we have a goddamn fat problem, don't you understand it?

[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.880]
Let's make it illegal to be fat

[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.580]
Right?

[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.060]
And have round up all the fatis

[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.120]
I see people for example in a convenience stores here buying cigarettes

[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:44.600]
Yeah

[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.180]
Do you know how much it costs for a pack of cigarettes here?

[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:47.940]
I have no idea

[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.400]
With all the fat here in the EST?

[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:49.740]
Right

[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.060]
Close to ten bucks

[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.340]
Now don't you think that's a great idea to help discourage people from smoking faggots?

[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.960]
Carlos, I have to quit today

[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:03.140]
Yeah, there you go, you can buy half a pack, you can buy one a cigarette, ten bucks a pack

[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.840]
Because they're asking for these fancy, they have more brands of cigarettes here than I've ever seen in my life

[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.340]
And candy, that's the two, well the one thing candy you go

[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.960]
Hockey and candy, that's candy

[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.400]
We got candy up the ass

[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.060]
927 and 560, WQAM

[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.740]
Hey guys, speaking of that size, does matter

[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:26.760]
And according to the Florida Department of Labor, computer professionals have some of the biggest ones in the history of mankind

[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.260]
And naturally we're talking about their paychecks

[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:33.040]
According to the state of Florida, computer careers are among the highest paid and the highest demand

[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.520]
And the demand is continuing to grow by the minute

[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.220]
Fast-tranking up you get your new high-paying computer career in just four short months

[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.220]
But you got to make the call, you're just talking about them for a long, for a coons' age now

[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.220]
So get with it

[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.300]
They've got locations in Kendall, Miami for Lauderdale and Pember Pines

[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.440]
And they've got day, evening and weekend schedule so they're no excuse to stay in a really crappy

[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.520]
That in job anymore, working for peanuts

[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.140]
Pick up that phone and call Fast Train at 1-866, Fast Train

[00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:01.020]
That's 866, Fast Train, that's peanuts is in, you know like peanut brittle

[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.200]
Fast Train's got full-time job placement and guaranteed financing too

[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.080]
Call them toll free or check them out at www.fasttrain.com

[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.640]
You can have a big fat paycheck too, 1-866, Fast Train

[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.720]
High and low, this is 420 or 560

[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.080]
2 AM

[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.680]
The honey tune yet

[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.440]
They just increased us to higher alert status

[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.580]
Hope no one blows up my brand new Dodge Travis

[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.640]
I've been a Rex's big gave us the news

[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.040]
Popping value with a big glass of booze

[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.980]
I keep a gas mask in my glove compartment

[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.160]
I call 3 Max for a bombproof apartment

[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.400]
Reinforce my front door with center blocks

[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.780]
Wonder if that will keep up the small pots

[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.320]
Checking my mail for that deadly white powder

[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.040]
Stocking my covers with Campbell's clam chowder

[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.500]
Living on orange alert, sure ain't no fun

[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.720]
I think the terrorists already won

[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:12.660]
I can't take it, I won't make it if it goes to red

[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.760]
I'll pull my covers up over my head and just stay in bed

[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.240]
Oh, he's dead

[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.640]
I'm 31 at 5.60 WQ AM

[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.540]
I made a bad mistake during the break

[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.800]
Oh no, I did what I said I was gonna do

[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.120]
Well, if this man I'm gonna buy any

[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.160]
If I want to buy it, I sure don't have to go online to buy it

[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.380]
I can go right out to any store and convenience store

[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.660]
Even the shoe stores here sell candy

[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.100]
Everybody in their brother sells candy

[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.740]
That's hand-witted, the hot dog stand got candy behind them there

[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.000]
Anyway, so I'm on a Roger's talk and do you look at it?

[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.600]
No, no, no, I don't need it

[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.640]
And the first thing that I Roger's classics

[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.500]
And let me caution you by saying this

[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.240]
Because I don't want people to waste their money and say

[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.120]
Oh, that was really crap

[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.640]
I've tasted some of the other stuff they make too

[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.600]
And it's really very pedestrian and pretty crappy, okay?

[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.480]
And you know that's true in a lot of places

[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.220]
Like if you go to a restaurant, sometimes there's a restaurant where they got one or two things that are great

[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.080]
And the rest of what's on the menu blows

[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.560]
You know what I'm talking about? I do

[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.520]
Well here for example, they got Victoria Creams and this one

[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.440]
But at the bottom of this list, six down it says

[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.860]
Two pound chocolate almond brittle

[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.080]
Oh my god, 24 pieces

[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.680]
Two pounds

[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.660]
Two pounds

[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:26.640]
And I guarantee you that I could easily eat two pounds right here during the show

[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.900]
While you weren't, while you didn't even always eating it, you're...

[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.900]
Huh? I'd race you

[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.700]
You never even had it yet

[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.580]
No, but I love chocolate

[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:40.700]
I've come up with all the time I'm gonna bring a few of these things, I will

[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.500]
At least I'll pull

[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.560]
Maybe there'll be just some empty wrappers in my bag

[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.300]
But at least I'll have the intention of bringing them home

[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.940]
You bring the chocolate, I'll bring the stretcher

[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.480]
97 votes on the pool

[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.420]
Who would be the happiest of Neil Croft?

[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.860]
More Howard David and Wood Dance on Neil's grave, 62

[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.480]
Dennis the chronic professional Catholic and homophob 13 tied with George

[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.200]
Things he'd get the show, 13

[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.760]
Greg Reed, a real evil doer, six and evil doer

[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.460]
Absolutely correct sir

[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.660]
Eric no more long pulls one, Geldie just out of spite one

[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.760]
And Fox News had the one, what happened to Fox News, John Gibson? Huh?

[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.880]
Who wrote that whole piece of it that big song advanced about, I'm this and I'm that, blah blah blah

[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.440]
All this other crap, what about him?

[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.540]
I don't know, what about...

[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.940]
Speaking of people that keep bouncing from one another and that work to another one

[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.420]
John Gibson what a kiss O.J. on the ass by the way

[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.100]
That he's out of his little local reporters job on a West Coast

[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.360]
So here's the facts from Big Arnie who says you're inspiring me not to be Big Arnie anymore

[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.620]
You're right, it's too dangerous

[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.180]
I have no health problems right now but need to drop weight before I do my wife has lost 43% of her body weight

[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:47.440]
While I've dropped maybe 10% a year and a half, I've used the excuse of eating because of stress

[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.840]
I guess it's more stressful than I from the fat, good point Arnie

[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.900]
I'm gonna lose the weight so I won't be Big Arnie anymore

[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.680]
This is for you, you don't even have to read this over here if you don't want to but I did

[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:01.060]
I did it just to try to inspire you Arnie so you live up to the, we don't put a lot of pressure on you

[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.600]
But you better do it or else

[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.520]
Okay, has he got it? No

[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.820]
I love this story about the woman chased by the fake aliens who on the TVB show

[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:15.320]
Look at that, we better take a couple of calls here because they're gonna get really upset and then they'll run away

[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.980]
What the hell was that in the beginning there where we hit a whole bunch of calls all lined up Carlos and then they all ran away

[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.840]
Probably people, probably people want to take shots at Hank

[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.220]
Oh, this here's a lot of, here's Fort Lauderdale, hello

[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.080]
Hey, Mia, love your show, man

[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:34.200]
How about the White Lauderdale for your poll and Corn Dogs on the island

[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.380]
White Lauderdale would like me to croak?

[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.780]
I don't know

[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:44.620]
Corn Dogs? Yeah, for your, for if you're on an island, Corn Dogs

[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.400]
Yeah, why you like Corn Dogs?

[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.520]
I love Corn Dogs

[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.120]
You love Corn Dogs? They're the best

[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.420]
Okay, well listen, watch out for the old Corn Hole

[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.840]
Here's a guy who loves Corn Dogs, they're nasty

[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.760]
Like you said, pedestrian, sure

[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.220]
They're like a ca ca ca on a stick or something like that

[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:05.340]
Ooh, man, I could understand if he would've just said like plain weeners, you know, something I can relate to

[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.380]
But Corn Dogs?

[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.580]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line the best

[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.280]
See, I've got an I wrote down candy or something but just best food

[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:21.440]
Like junk food that you want to have if you only had one unlimited supply of one kind of food

[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.200]
On a desert island somewhere and we're not talking about human body parts

[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.180]
Speaking of Dwight, Laura Deaccombe

[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.100]
I'm not talking about that Dwight, okay?

[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.700]
Look at this poll, Mohawar David had would dance on my grandfielder on the pressure already

[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.440]
112 votes and he's got 70 of would dance on my grave if I croak

[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.280]
I wonder what his reaction was when he heard that I had this stroke

[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.700]
Probably the same as everybody else in town, I know

[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.340]
Did you see anything in the newspaper about it?

[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:47.520]
No!

[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.980]
You see Tom Jicker writing about that? No, he's busy writing about network TV shows again

[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.340]
Tom, you're an idiot, okay?

[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:57.240]
At least you're consistent, you haven't written about anything local in about 400 years now

[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.040]
Anything about, forget about just me, anything about anybody

[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.220]
On the local scene but I'm supposed to be out of touch

[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:09.300]
Mohawar David at 70, Dennis the chronic 16, George thinks he'd get the show 14

[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.920]
Maybe you and Moe could do it like a tap dance together

[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.540]
On my grave, that would be cute

[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.740]
Greg Reed, a real evil doer, eight Fox News Heather two, Eric one and Guilty one

[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.100]
We still don't see John Gibson on there

[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.100]
Well maybe Eric doesn't want to put John Gibson on there for whatever reason

[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.920]
Maybe Eric likes John Gibson

[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.640]
Here's Miami, hello

[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.940]
Neil, yes sir

[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.020]
Yes, you forgot Reverend Jones

[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.560]
No, but Reverend Jones is the show, Reverend Jones is just trying to go on

[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:43.320]
You can, you can me, Reverend Jones would be in the evening morning for months, what the hell would he do?

[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.000]
He would never really call him

[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.400]
Yeah, but this is not him, yeah

[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.100]
No, it's not

[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.260]
It is not your gay

[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.320]
That's not him, it's not even close to being him

[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.040]
George, what are you, what are you on?

[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.080]
What kind of drugs are you doing?

[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.320]
It's not me and I was just going to give George a couple until

[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:00.500]
This guy sounds, this guy sounds about as much like Reverend Jones's

[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.620]
I sound like guilty, everybody else is talking about

[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.720]
Says his name except for him

[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.980]
It's not him, go ahead

[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:09.840]
Not him, it's not me, but your gay, no I'm just kidding

[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.420]
All right Neil, love the show

[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.580]
Thanks, goodbye

[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.220]
That was not him, him or one of his stuages

[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:21.340]
No, I'm going to jump out the window, I really am, and I'm way up high in the sky

[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.220]
I don't know what you're talking about, he doesn't have any stuages

[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.060]
Why are you, what are you talking about?

[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.300]
He's talking about voices, nobody else mentions his name except him

[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.420]
That is not true

[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:30.820]
Okay

[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.480]
Absolutely, when we took the poll on the chronic callers, Reverend Jones had a lot of votes

[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.080]
You know, Reverend Jones, right?

[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.000]
That was not him, it was Carlos, was that him?

[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.900]
Sounded like him to me after you played the your gay thing, but I'm not sure

[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.700]
I don't know his voice good enough, well he's not a gay

[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.100]
I will bet both of your lives on it that it was not him, okay?

[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.400]
That's how confident I am

[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:48.700]
Okay

[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.200]
That it was not him

[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.000]
What is, man?

[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.640]
This George, talk about an uptack, no one of they hate you, man

[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.760]
Just loosen up a little bit, look at what happened to me, lighten up a little bit

[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.000]
I'm light, I watch, yeah, we know that

[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.080]
I watched Smallville last night, I go to bed about 10 after 10, I'm lying here

[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.840]
I'm on a virgin fall, I'm asleep the phone rings, I go running to the room, I don't have a phone in my bedroom

[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.380]
I go running to the other room, grab the phone and there's the depressing Norma Kent

[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:15.660]
Norm, don't call me anymore unless you got something meaningful to tell me, okay?

[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.840]
If you can't get your money from Greg yet, it's par for the course, I don't really, you know, what can I do for you?

[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.280]
And he's a big shot, he's a Panthers an Oonisper center one and the Merleins are going to do that

[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.660]
And Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh!

[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.800]
Ten minutes, I'm sitting here on a phone, not saying a word, you know?

[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:31.880]
Mm-hmm

[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.320]
He starts out, oh, what's this about, you had a stroke as if you're very concerned

[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.760]
You know what I'm saying? I'm not saying he's not concerned but he should be concerned enough to let me go to sleep

[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.080]
I get up at six o'clock at a goddamn morning Norm, let me sleep all right

[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.680]
Don't be called people at ten o'clock at night unless it's an emergency

[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.860]
Like maybe exciting news like Greg actually paid you what he owes you

[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.800]
And by the way, Greg, you're still a liar.

[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.320]
Oh, yeah, they have the lawyer call them up and say,

[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.340]
oh, don't sue us for the money.

[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.340]
Isn't this something that you have to keep suing these people

[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.780]
to get money that they owe you that they admit?

[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.460]
It's not like the money is in dispute.

[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.920]
In other words, they admit they owe you the money.

[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:02.780]
And then they end up,

[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.100]
we're going to have, you'll have the check on Monday for sure.

[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.580]
That's meaning this past Monday.

[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:07.360]
Did he have the check?

[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:08.540]
No.

[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.520]
No, he didn't have the check.

[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.600]
But what am I going to do about that?

[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.820]
So do I need that stress?

[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.100]
Do I need the stress?

[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:15.400]
No.

[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.400]
It would be like, you calling me at one in the morning and saying,

[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.100]
by the way, you're still suffering from the effects of the stroke.

[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.000]
And by the way, my wife just threw me out of the street.

[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.340]
You know, as if that would be a big surprise.

[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:26.680]
What am I going to do about it?

[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:27.400]
Nothing.

[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.000]
No, not a goddamn thing.

[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.020]
I wouldn't blame her for throwing your ass out on the street.

[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:31.720]
In the first place.

[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:36.100]
Especially with your attitude today that you're so hostile toward these people, man.

[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:36.820]
Not hostile.

[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:37.860]
Hostile.

[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.300]
No wonder I have to beg for calls.

[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.220]
You chase them all away.

[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.000]
It was him.

[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.480]
By the way, speaking about hostile McGill's not him.

[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.580]
And say it said that.

[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:44.980]
Wait a minute.

[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:45.380]
Who called?

[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:45.860]
McGill.

[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:46.960]
Yeah.

[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.140]
McGill called and said that.

[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.060]
Yes, it was him.

[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.200]
So it was not him.

[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.360]
He sounded about as much like Reverend Jones's McGill does.

[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.040]
And tell him the girl to butt out, okay?

[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.400]
When we start talking about Castro again, then McGill can call in, okay?

[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.820]
Professional spick.

[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.040]
Professional grease ball.

[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.460]
We're not interested in your opinion, okay?

[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:06.180]
McGill butt out.

[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.580]
Silly goose.

[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.420]
Fony baloney.

[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:10.960]
Oh, yeah, I love the bedtime stories.

[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:11.920]
Yeah, right.

[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.260]
You're such an ass sucker.

[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.160]
Well, I'm going to next time I come back, I'm going to stick Doreen on him.

[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.620]
We're going to time McGill up, stick him in a corner there and let Doreen have her way with

[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:20.980]
him.

[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.460]
Think that'll straighten his ass out.

[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.600]
Yeah, we're going to toss him on his new bed from Dalmatians on big new macros.

[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.540]
We're just going to lock him down in the middle of it and let her surround him with her outpouring

[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.000]
of love.

[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.920]
20 till 10 at 5.60 WQN.

[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.520]
I've been telling you about the health benefits of olio med.

[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.700]
God, I wish I had some.

[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.640]
And I'll keep telling you because the stuff really works for those who are taking it.

[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.980]
Of course, you have to take it or it doesn't do much.

[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:52.320]
Olio med soft gels contain pharmaceutical rate olive oil, not ordinary olive oil, but super

[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.500]
concentrated, bloated with health benefits.

[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.520]
Even the old geeks and Greeks and Romans knew that.

[00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.380]
Olio med every day can help reduce the risk of heart disease and high cholesterol, Arnie.

[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.180]
Plus there are 14 different olio med formulas to choose from.

[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.940]
Each one combining pharmaceutical rate olive oil with vitamins, minerals and herbals to

[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.300]
support specific needs from bones to blood pressure to the immune system.

[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.360]
Just choose the formulas that are right for you.

[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.120]
Now there are three new olio med formulas.

[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.960]

[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:41.700]
Right in local, we are supporting O560CUAM.

[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.500]
This is Ward.

[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.600]
Not as pedophile.

[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.720]
There's a little woman.

[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.080]
All right guys, knock it off.

[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:50.380]
Hey!

[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:51.480]
Hey!

[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.980]
Are you being fat fruit cake?

[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:54.820]
Guys, that's not nice at all.

[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.080]
Now, I'm going to cry.

[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.420]
I'm going to call your parents is what I'm going to do.

[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:03.900]
Let's face it, being a house husband is hard enough without having to worry about the

[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:04.340]
laundry.

[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.120]
And thanks to new simply clean with bleach, I don't have to worry.

[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:14.620]
Simply clean gets out all the tough stains like grass stains, coffee, picks, the f*** this

[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.820]
charge, dried on f*** like on this t-shirt.

[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:22.180]
So when my wife gets home, my laundry will score an A-plus.

[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.300]
I need a home.

[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.680]
Well there he is now.

[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.380]
New simply clean with bleach.

[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:27.800]
Get's up the f*** dirt.

[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.140]
I'm 45 at 560 W-CUAM.

[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:33.400]
151 votes on a pool who'd be the happiest of Neil Croak.

[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.240]
Moe Howard David would dance on Neil's grave, 88.

[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.860]
Dennis the chronic professional Catholic in homophobes, 22.

[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.220]
Not even a contest, is it?

[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:41.380]
Yeah.

[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.060]
No.

[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.120]
George thinks he'd get the show 21.

[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.080]
That's where the battle is between you and your friend Dennis.

[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:47.460]
My buddy.

[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.940]
Greg Reed, a real evil duet, 12 Fox News Heather, 5.

[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:53.940]
Geltie just out of spite, 2 Eric no more long, pulls one.

[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.320]
And John Gibson, a Fox News, it probably should sound her, but I don't mind get picky because

[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.620]
the Eric will get more votes.

[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.240]
John Gibson, none.

[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.440]
Now here's an excellent thing.

[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:02.620]
Did you read this whole thing?

[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:03.920]
They used to send me this, yeah.

[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.140]
Facts from West Palm.

[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:05.620]
Mm-hmm.

[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:06.640]
Outstanding.

[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.140]
I mean it's a little sick.

[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:08.760]
Yeah.

[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.660]
And that's the way we like it on the show.

[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.200]
In regard to today's pool, I'd hate to think anyone would be glad to see you keel over.

[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.660]
Here's my alternative to the pool.

[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:17.140]
What do you think?

[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.520]
I think it's a great thing.

[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.020]
Which W-CUAM personality will be the first to croak?

[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:28.420]
Neil, Hank, Moe, Geltie, Mad Dog, Josie, the beast.

[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.060]
Anyk, Mark, Joe, the big-

[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:31.300]
Oh!

[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.040]
Joe Rose, George, etc.

[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.300]
I think he's covered him all, hasn't he?

[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.920]
Pretty thorough when he left off with Kimba Bo camper.

[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.860]
It's a list of them all.

[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.820]
That way you're showing no favoritism or bias.

[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:48.740]
Then he goes on to say unfortunately my vote would be for the hammer, although he'd only be even money in Vegas.

[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.700]
I've yet to see Moe, but he sounds like an old cocker who may give Hank a run for his money.

[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.980]
Don't get me wrong, I don't want to see anyone go, but this would be an interesting pool.

[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.500]
I think he's got a point, don't you?

[00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.280]
I think it's an idea.

[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.640]
Well, you want to eliminate today's pool and put this on there instead?

[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.920]
No, we can save this for tomorrow or something.

[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.660]
What's the right...

[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.380]
It's the QAM death pool week is what it is.

[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:11.960]
That's bad.

[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:12.880]
I think it's death.

[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.000]
What else are you going to do about it?

[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.240]
Not too much, I guess.

[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.260]
Here's a call from Jupiter, hello.

[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.500]
Hey, Neil, it's a rough...

[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:19.540]
How are you, sir?

[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:20.480]
How are you?

[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.960]
About Hank, you know, you hit it right in the head just passing his schmoosing.

[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:28.800]
You got to have a balance and he's out there and it's like I hate to say it, but so far gone.

[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:29.980]
You know?

[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.960]
I mean, you can't...

[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:38.120]
His whole thing is eating and party, meeting people, but without that balance in your description,

[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.660]
maybe think of money placed on Waparthin men.

[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.480]
Remember that part?

[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.720]
That's a prehistoric story.

[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.720]
Yeah, Mr. Kislo.

[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.500]
It's sad because I like the hammer.

[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:50.920]
We all do.

[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:51.820]
I mean, most of us do.

[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.760]
There's some people hate him, but there are a lot of people hate me too.

[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.780]
But the point is, it's just a tragic.

[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.320]
You see it happening and there's nothing you can say or do.

[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:02.800]
I mean, I keep trying to take these shots on you or hoping, because I know we listen to hoping that I can convince him,

[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:06.320]
just to put whatever he's eaten down.

[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:10.760]
But you don't know like an alcoholic, and it's bargone as he is, and I hate to say it.

[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.900]
I mean, what's he going to do?

[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.200]
Get a stomach staple or something?

[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.820]
I mean, really, it's draft and measures.

[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.960]
At this point for the guy, you know?

[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:21.160]
We're in the wisdom lock, and no more wapathin men.

[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.080]
No more crap.

[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:22.680]
Okay, thanks.

[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.380]
See, there's a guy who at least wishes everybody well.

[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:25.960]
Right?

[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:31.780]
He's not sitting out there rubbing his hands and glee, hoping one of us is going to croak, because we're obsessed with fat.

[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:32.940]
But it is true.

[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:37.980]
I think if Hank would like, change the balance, like a few more strip clubs and strippers,

[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.100]
and a few less dinners at all these restaurants, see what I'm saying?

[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.780]
More keto strips, less strippers.

[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:43.480]
Right.

[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.040]
Exactly.

[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.200]
Isn't he diabetic?

[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:46.380]
Yeah.

[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:47.820]
Okay.

[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.080]
Fat rich.

[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:50.700]
Is he diabetic?

[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:51.160]
Is he?

[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.260]
Yes, I say.

[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.040]
Am I diabetic?

[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:53.420]
Yeah.

[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.520]
I've lunch here by the way this morning was 101.

[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:57.360]
That's good.

[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.760]
Well, it's good only because I'm damn sure I'm making it good.

[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:05.360]
I mean, if it wasn't good this week after having that stroke a week ago Sunday,

[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.680]
if it wasn't good now, I might as well just jump out the window.

[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:08.420]
See what I'm saying?

[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:08.760]
Yeah.

[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.680]
What would be the point?

[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.520]
Although there are other people, and you see they get the messages,

[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.440]
and they have all their different, they're taken out their organs one at a time.

[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.360]
It's like the smokers.

[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:19.980]
You, you heard about the smokers.

[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:23.600]
They put them in a hospital, they make them put a tube in their lungs so they can smoke through the two.

[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:24.520]
They smoke through the neck.

[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.520]
So they're into the nicotine.

[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.280]
A hole in their neck they're smoking through.

[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.160]
That's what I'm saying.

[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.820]
They're smoking through a frickin hole in their neck.

[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:32.580]
Jesus.

[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:33.940]
Freckin.

[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:34.660]
No in their neck.

[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.040]
Yeah.

[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.980]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on it.

[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.520]
So we got corn dogs so far in the other little, huh?

[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:46.560]
When you think the audience come up with something a little bit more tempting than corn dogs?

[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.020]
Those corn dogs sure are special.

[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.120]
Go man, go corn doggy go.

[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.200]
Here's Pompano, hello.

[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.980]
That corn dog is nasty.

[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.580]
What is he had a lack of corn dog?

[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.100]
He must spend too much time at the county fair or something.

[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.300]
If you're going to be at the county fair, at least get the cotton candy.

[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:02.840]
Cotton candy.

[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.640]
How about some form of candy, anything other than a corn dog?

[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.360]
Nobody's going to give me something specific.

[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.540]
I thought he was going to say a Schmidt-Kead bar.

[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.420]
Even that'll work.

[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:16.120]

[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.900]
But you know, it's funny you mentioned Norm Penn, I co-produced this show.

[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.700]
You co-produced this show?

[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:29.180]
Yeah, I feel in, actually this week I'm filling in for somebody who's taken a day off, a week off, actually.

[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.160]
Who's, name I won't mention.

[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:31.860]
Yeah.

[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.160]
Yeah.

[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.600]
But, uh, this is funny you mentioned that, I'm out of Norm.

[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:43.520]
Because, uh, any, any who, uh, corn dog, that's the worst.

[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.260]
Okay.

[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:45.520]
Oh.

[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.500]
And what time can I read that?

[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.400]
If you co-produced this show, pass the message.

[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.140]
Don't call me anymore late at night, okay?

[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.320]
I just got you having a stroke.

[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.200]
I'm trying to get some rest.

[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:02.300]
People are cooperating.

[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.100]
Muff got the message.

[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.640]
He sent me a little thing on the internet.

[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.300]
I went on my, uh, on my email.

[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.100]
I took a look at it.

[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:08.500]
It was great.

[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.080]
And that's it.

[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.460]
He didn't bother calling me again yesterday.

[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.460]
And don't do it anymore, Muff.

[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.400]
Till I let you know.

[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:13.640]
Don't give me the high sign.

[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:15.580]
God.

[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.300]
You're like, somebody calling you three in the morning.

[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:25.160]
When you remember those puking, horrible, sick, flu episodes, you've had, right?

[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.560]
Coming in and going home with that, and somebody calling you three in the morning saying,

[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.480]
or are you sick?

[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.180]
Right?

[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.400]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:32.980]
You get what I do, of course.

[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.820]
Leave people alone when people are not feeling their best.

[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:36.520]
Leave them alone.

[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.680]
Let their body have a chance to heal up.

[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:39.880]
What is this called?

[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.500]
See how you were doing.

[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:40.820]
Christ.

[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:41.400]
What?

[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:42.940]
Wanted to call and see how you were doing.

[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.360]
I don't want them to know how I'm doing.

[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.660]
They'll, they can listen to the show and hear I'm doing just fine.

[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.220]
It's going to be sunny and 38 today, 36, whatever.

[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.520]
Uh, this, what a little snowy God is going to be melting.

[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.660]
Everything here is wonderful.

[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.180]
Leafs, one last night came from behind.

[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.200]
Four, three over Caroline, over the Hercun's.

[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.000]
What more could you want?

[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.680]
Even a Panthers one last night.

[00:42:59.740 --> 00:42:59.840]
Oh!

[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.500]
What the hell more could life be, okay?

[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.080]
Then maybe some Roger's almond brew.

[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.380]
That is dangerous.

[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.960]
Sometimes if I, and I probably shouldn't talk about it because someday,

[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.720]
somebody's going to point the finger at me and say,

[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:14.200]
first it was the goddamn fish food.

[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:14.520]
Right.

[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.580]
Then it was the bagel bites from whoever the hell makes that.

[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.180]
And then that wasn't bad enough.

[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.680]
Although the bokeh burgers, at least nobody's going to get fat from those.

[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.600]
Are they still around?

[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.920]
Oh yeah, they're in the supermarkets here.

[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:26.340]
You bet.

[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.340]
And they're good if you like.

[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:29.460]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:32.600]
If you like burger king, you like the bokeh burgers because they taste like rubber.

[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:33.580]
Rubber on the out.

[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:34.140]
Huh?

[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:35.440]
No, they're okay.

[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.020]
The bokeh burger really feels like they've got them up a little bit with a slice of tomato

[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.820]
and onion and put little spices on them.

[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.340]
They're not bad.

[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.160]
I want some cow.

[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:42.940]
You want some real meat.

[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.220]
Yeah, that's what I'm feeling, too.

[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.460]
I like some real meat, myself.

[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:50.980]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60 pound, five, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.460]
And I do want to say this.

[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.980]
As much as I'm getting really sick of that business between Chloe and Lana on the small

[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:01.340]
bill, they had her dolled up last night with the first night to hold it since the show has been

[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:01.600]
on it.

[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:02.940]
She actually was prettier than Clark.

[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:06.240]
No, seriously, she looked really good last night Lana.

[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:07.060]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:08.840]
She looked great.

[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:09.560]
She always.

[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.320]
No, I'm serious.

[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.500]
She really looked stunning last night.

[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.880]
Either was the makeup or something.

[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.780]
She got lucky or I don't know what it was.

[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.340]
Maybe you can get lucky with him though.

[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:18.000]
No.

[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.340]
And that part of the story that's a one, one complaint about small bill.

[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:25.820]
The stories are very compelling and very exciting and very action packed and yaddy yaddy yaddy.

[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:31.480]
But I'm getting really burnt out and that whole story line thing with Lana and Chloe and

[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.060]
they're like both got the hots for Clark.

[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.080]
Why don't they understand?

[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.940]
Maybe he's not interested in them.

[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:36.460]
He floated.

[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:36.960]
Right.

[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:41.020]
Maybe he's more interested in like he's maybe gay.

[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:41.940]
That could be it.

[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.940]
Maybe he wants to rub oil on Lex's head.

[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:47.460]
Maybe he'd like to, maybe he'd like to turn him into the oily bird or something.

[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:47.980]
I don't know.

[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.000]
Flex Luther.

[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:51.920]
Here's Miami.

[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.260]
Hello.

[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.240]
Neil.

[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.060]
Yes sir.

[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.460]
Sadly you have become a shadow of your former self.

[00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:58.160]
Really?

[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:02.740]
I mean your show is devolved into the Neil and Psycho-Fantic George show.

[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:03.280]
Yeah.

[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.340]
And so why are you listening?

[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.540]
I tune out often.

[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.120]
Well then my suggestion is do it right now before your brain gets any more polluted.

[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.140]
That's another one of those chronic regulars.

[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:13.520]
Right.

[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.300]
My show is degenerated to the Neil and Psycho.

[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.120]
I like the show.

[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.000]
I'm more having a good time.

[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.060]
See that's what he doesn't like.

[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.900]
We're having a really new back up there and you're in a good mood and you're not dying.

[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:22.960]
Yeah and that's right.

[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.880]
We're very satisfied.

[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.560]
I'm very pleased with the way I sound now after having a stroke.

[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.360]
Everything is going great.

[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.500]
But there again is another nice stuff from South Florida.

[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.140]
Not hey how you doing you feeling okay.

[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.380]
Your show is degenerated.

[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:36.400]
But this guy's listening every minute of every day.

[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:36.940]
He's a chronic.

[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.740]
I mean it's one voice.

[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.000]
I mean you thought that the other guy was Mr. Reverend Joan.

[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.940]
This guy is as chronic as the day is long.

[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:44.180]
Yep.

[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:46.340]
But he's got a sick offentic.

[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:46.780]
I don't want to go with it.

[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:47.800]
Psychrophantic George.

[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:48.160]
Yeah.

[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.860]
I thought George is being rather sick myself today.

[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.960]
Like you know, a hundred and a half old.

[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.060]
So this is one of his lackeys.

[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.480]
Oh brother.

[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.140]
How about Jim lackey, the harness driver?

[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:58.800]
It was him.

[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:00.440]
It was not him.

[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.260]
Just kidding.

[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.500]
Are you trying to give me another stroke?

[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:03.800]
I know.

[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.300]
Oh please God don't.

[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.380]
In spite of what the poll says.

[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.180]
Who'd be the happiest of Neil croaked?

[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.460]
Moe Howard David would dance on Neil's grave 111.

[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.080]
Then is the chronic professional Catholic homophob 28.

[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.080]
George thinks he'd get the show 25.

[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:18.200]
He sure working on it now.

[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:19.700]
He's pushing it.

[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.100]
Greg Reed.

[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.840]
A real evil.

[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:23.340]
A real evil.

[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:24.920]
There were 13 Fox News.

[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.960]
Heather's got six.

[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.000]
Gildi just out of spite for you.

[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:28.720]
Watch out for him.

[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.300]
He's the he's the chigger in a wood pile.

[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:30.780]
A Gildi.

[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.260]
He's dangerous.

[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:33.580]
Eric no more long polls one.

[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.520]
And John Gibson.

[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.640]
A Fox News has one.

[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:39.260]
Sarah we pushing Eric a little bit too much.

[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:39.680]
They're good.

[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.820]
He deserves it.

[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.200]
956 at 560 W.

[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.620]
Kim speaking of losing weight.

[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.880]
Speaking of not being so fat and sick all the time.

[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.040]
Here's the answer for you.

[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.460]
Delight the West Boko.

[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:50.560]
A great store that's the one.

[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.160]
You know something that last chronic.

[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.120]
I'm trying to tell you exactly who that was as a matter of fact.

[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:55.440]
Yeah.

[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:56.680]
Was that Mitch?

[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.700]
Well that was one of those, you know, one of the little crew.

[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:00.480]
One of those.

[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.200]
One of the QAM wrecking crew.

[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.300]
Anyway, over 600 delicious low carb food products in this one great store.

[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.560]
Sure front atkins or.

[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.500]
Skatkins are named at the low carb diets.

[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:10.880]
This store is dedicated to you.

[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:15.560]
Be sure and check out the new low carb tortilla chips in original or pico gallop flavor by

[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.440]
carbon sense.

[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.820]
And with a great tasting no carb rucheta by Walden farm you'll be in.

[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:34.020]
Right.

[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.360]
I can't hear anything Remaz.

[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.800]
Stop slowing the floor.

[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:38.460]

[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.640]

[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.160]
The moves are working out very well.

[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.220]
The practice is fourth and it's time slot and moving out.

[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:45.220]

[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:45.220]

[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:45.260]

Hold on a second.

[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:57.300]

[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:03.940]

[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.780]
Don't tell me Remaz.

[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.660]
I'll jam that thing down your throat.

[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.220]
Give the food burn away from me.

[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.720]

[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:19.160]

[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.200]

One of the virulent anti-Semites in homophobes in history the human race Reverend

[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:04.740]

[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:23.360]
Makes me feel very bad then is the chronic professional Catholic at homophobes 31 George thinks he'd get to show 29

[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.340]
Greg read 14 Fox News Heather 11

[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:32.300]
Yoldi six Eric one and John Gibson to Fox News. He's got a small one in fact the fact says

[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:36.300]
I'm as used to refer to John Gibson as the ghoul because of his facial scars

[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:42.660]
What a concept that quips calling someone a ghoul it says he also described Gibson as one of the dumbest factors on TV

[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:49.200]
Which was more to the point Gibson rose to fame because of OJ like many OJ trial benefactors has no real news credentials

[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.720]
And you are absolutely correct

[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:54.200]
He was a flunky reporter at LA when a whole OJ thing started

[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.820]
Sorry about your stroke. It says your second one. I think yes

[00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:01.420]
What were your symptoms and was it diet related? Yes, it was it was fat related and it was also

[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:07.640]
What do they call sedentary related sitting on my ass for seven weeks in South Florida eating like a pig and

[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:09.400]
That's it

[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:13.880]
Little blood tacos your lungs cuts off your circulation your brain and like that

[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.480]
little stroke

[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:21.200]
Took me only a 10 hours in a hospital convinced him that I had a stroke and it took my friend doctor

[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.960]
Hampton tell me that I was right and it's played in the exactly what happened. Well, what do you know?

[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:30.780]
I know my craft is right. Oh my strokes, mr. Okay. I've stroke a few in my time

[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:36.620]
5 6 7 0 5 60 palm 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line

[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:43.280]
Here's Miami lakes. Hello, hey Neil. Yes, sir. Hey. I'm really sorry about your stroke man

[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:48.280]
I know you had one a few years back and this man you've got to stop

[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:55.880]
Living the 7th area lifestyle you know how to control the stroke from happening again. I don't know why why you don't do it

[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.320]
Yeah, really

[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:03.600]
If you know what you can do to avoid a helicopter excuse me, that's okay

[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.760]
If you know you can

[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.300]
Avoid it. I don't understand why you don't do it

[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:12.980]
What does that mean if you can avoid a stroke if you know what the reasons why you know what I'm doing

[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:16.560]
I've lost eight pounds in a week. I'm out walking every day as much as I can in the abroid or weather

[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:19.340]
But it's not that bad anymore. I'm doing a lot better now than I was there

[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:21.800]
So you've tried to explain you when I'm there. It's a death wish

[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.360]
It's Florida. That's well

[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.580]
It's it's it's out floater. There's nowhere to walk. There's no real exercise

[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:31.160]
I said on my ass in fact some of my days were comprised of sitting on my S four hours at work

[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:37.460]
Then going home and sitting my ass watching TV and then going to the track and feeding my face and sitting my ass for another five or six hours

[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:41.760]
But you're absolutely right is it this lifestyle down here is from your car to the mole from the mole to the car

[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.640]
That's hard to the food to the restaurant. See here. I don't have a car

[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.840]
It's true. I don't have a car. I walk more here already in Islam

[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:52.320]
I've been here for about five days. How about more in these five days than I will down here in five years

[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.640]
Yeah, absolutely right. I'm originally from New York City in New York City

[00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:01.940]
At least they walk down there right that's right. They take the subway they walk a my triglyceride level is is very high

[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:06.820]
It has been very high up to 800 so I think yeah three to four times a week

[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:11.320]
I walk in the morning to reduce those triglycerides are reduced my triglycerides are 78

[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:16.060]
That's fantastic. Yeah, it is that's that's supposed to show you just because my cholesterol wasn't too bad my

Why do I want to see them in black and white because it's nostalgic and it brings back memories and you like it?

www.ready.gov if you want to see Tom origin all those childish those juvenile suggestions and how you and a family can save yourself from the

[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:22.320]
Impending disaster that's coming any minute not that we want you to panic you understand that but

[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.060]
Just relax

[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:29.940]
You and before that they showed this dog did you see the thing of the dog on the Pasek River any ice?

[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.500]
No, that's stranded

[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.880]
That's what we said. I mean they got a rescue thing going on

[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:38.060]
Would seem to me that they must have helicopters with pontoons right

[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.200]
In be they do at least we did we hear right

[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:46.940]
So it seemed to me that would be the way to go because the dog is out there like an ice thing and he's looking around like

[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:50.820]
You know where the hell is somebody already come and get me and that's very depressing, you know

[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.960]
I mean you're a lot of people I can think of wouldn't mind if they were out there right at ice barge but the dog, you know

[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.680]
Woman chased by fake aliens whose reality TV show

[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:07.220]
Carole blank thought she was being chased by a space alien in Los Angeles on a way to where posh Hollywood to home all in the end of this to chopped off

[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:12.080]
What a shame remember I said it was gonna be copied this because it would be better right but the end of it is all chopped off

[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.820]
That's because probably because it's from what's his name the grudge report

[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.880]
You want me to re-tax you the other one?

[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:22.140]
No, but the alien turned out to be an actor in a monster suit and the party was phony as well

[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:26.420]
So now the Los Angeles grade school teacher and aspiring actress is fighting back

[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:28.980]
suing the new TV reality series tactics

[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:35.460]
What is it something tactic? Care tactics. Care tactics. See that's such a chop off claiming she suffered severe emotional damage court papers

[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:42.200]
It is today stupid bitch now what that'd be a good poll question would you rather be more scared being followed by a space alien or any legal alien

[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:47.860]
Well, what country blank suit the sci-fi channel the producers the scare tactics into actors for

[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:54.500]
Scaring or so badly that she had to be hospitalized several times for physical injuries and severe emotional distress her lawyer said

[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:59.760]
Langstead she was a non-consenting and unwitting victim of a hidden camera show with a science fiction twist

[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:06.820]
How do you like that? I got to see it. I do anybody for that anybody by any almond brittle yet

[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:11.540]
So the one fool we've got so far from this very astute audience that they like to have if they were on a stranded island

[01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:14.980]
And they can have as much of it as they wanted but nothing else is corndog

[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:18.460]
Oh

[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.460]

They think that he's that evil that hateful that much of a miserable nasty old cout and you know what? Yeah, they could be right

[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:47.420]
George thinks he'd get the show 37 down dentist the chronic which that was him before the one about the a show is the generator

[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.280]
I was gonna say something but that was him

[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.560]
You know they get the other episode that previous episode. I was just gonna keep an awesome

[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:57.120]
No, no, I thought about it because I did not say I recognize the voice and then I was he's got kind of that blank

[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.400]
Yes, so that was him

[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:02.860]
So we've had Reverend Jones alleged and definitely dentist the chronic who's still listening by the way

[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:05.360]
This is a guy who's busy calling Moe and everybody else

[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.260]
He doesn't belong on the year and I won't risk till we get him off the air and he's discussing and the meantime

[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:13.040]
He calls the show he still calling the show he can't turn it off

[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:19.980]
And even the audiences on the adentist every time we take a pull and put his name on look how well he does or badly or depending how you look at it

[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:25.580]
They're on the ad they've heard your crap. They know what you're all about on every radio station by the way

[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:30.060]
Dennis the chronic professional Catholic homophobic 32 votes trading George by only five

Even though you're having a very morbid poll today

[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:14.600]
So yeah, one way it's morbid. It's just being honest. That's all the honest show

[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:18.520]
We just know that if I quote there'd be certain people who would be very happy about it

[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.860]
But then they'd have nobody to hate they'd have a fun for you

[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:26.420]
Oh, they did find somebody that the hateful people always find somebody to hate. Don't you remember that song by Jefferson airplane somebody to hate?

[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:32.240]
I you know I crawled I was um so I don't employ for a while

[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:39.820]
I've been like searching the web I looked on Bermuda.com because I live in there a while and there's a link to your website there

[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:44.740]
Why is that why is that I don't know because I think I turned on a few people and they liked you over there

[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:50.940]
How do you like that? Hey, hello Bermuda even though you can't hear us they can though. I see it. I still listen to you get out of here

[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:56.880]
Bermuda I swear I still I see you in the web. Do you have any idea how far out into the Atlantic Bermuda is?

[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.340]
650 miles so how about can I hear that signal when you go out and 441 and it's like

[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:07.500]
like that and they can hear us in Bermuda the web oh I see well in the web they can hear us anywhere in the world

[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:12.940]
I mean that's goes without saying we used to all meet at the coffee shop and talk about your show. Oh

[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:18.180]
Well, you're pretty exciting place. Oh man. It's chronic. Is this chronic is this place? Mm-hmm

[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:23.800]
Yeah, I believe it's more about the guy that wanted me to spend my afternoon looking at Godfather pictures on the internet

[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:28.240]
I mean it I almost forgot what he's called's were coming from so I probably took it with a little too hard on him

[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.740]
So I figure I figure that since we have nobody to blame for his blizzard I figured it was a

[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:37.000]
Sodom's doing for the blizzard maybe that's a good reason to attack

[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:38.760]
Okay, have a great day

[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:44.020]

Survey backs US radio consolidation

[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:57.900]
This is one of the most ridiculous stories I've ever ridden my life and they're doing it because all their big clients like

[01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:04.420]
Teapchannel that's what they wanted them to say and it also says that in the historic we'll get to that maybe oh the state of oral sex

[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:05.560]
Don't let me forget about that

[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.600]
What state is that in mr. Cippy?

[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.320]
I think that's why Rick we've removed there just before he passed on to the great football booth in the sky

[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:20.880]
How safe is oral sex that question's been on the tip of many tongues ever since AIDS raised its deadly head now

[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.960]
What this is from the village voice by the way now?

[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.900]
On experts said that philatio may not be rescued all at least what it comes to spreading HIV

[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.200]
Dr. Jeffrey Klausner who heads the sexually transmitted disease prevention effort at San Francisco Department of Public Health

[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:43.060]
Based his conclusion on a new study of 239 gay or bisexual men who reported no anal or vaginal sex and no injection drug use in the prior six months

[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:46.500]
98% said they'd given head without condoms

[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:52.520]
28% said they knew their partner was HIV positive and although a 39% said they had swallowed semen

[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.360]
None of the men became infected

[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.020]
The risk of HIV transmission via oral sex

[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:00.920]
Cousner maintains is and I'm going to read this exactly the way it's printed

[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:08.340]
You'll see it on our website. This is on the state of oral sex. He says is very very very very very very low and maybe zero

[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:15.040]
Did you get that are you pushing that homosexual agenda again? The risk of HIV transmission via oral sex

[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.300]
Maintains is very very very very very very low and maybe zero

[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:23.260]
A 2002 Spanish study supports Klausner's views speak

[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:30.500]
researchers there followed 110 women and 25 men all HIV negative for 10 years each participant had an HIV positive partner

[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:37.700]
The investigators estimated that over the course of the study the couples engaged in 19,000 acts of unprotected philatio or cunnelingus

[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:41.360]
None of the negative partners converted in other words got infected

[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.500]
Got it got it that's good. So there you go

[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:54.500]
State of oral sex is uh, no, no, no, no, not suggest him. I'm not recommending. I'm not endorsing

[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:59.640]
I'm just reading to whatever it says and that's in the very very left wing village voice follow on the same

[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.680]

And what I found is a lot of time something will work for you once and your brain kind of outsparks itself

With her leather jacket and smoking guitar she epitomized the uh

[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:20.140]
Leather jacket and smoking guitar look popularized in the 1980s by

[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:21.640]
her

[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.880]
She was Jones

[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:32.220]
I just wanted to say to the world hey, I'm a girl

[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:37.220]
I'm not got a leather jacket and a smoking guitar so you can kiss my female ass

[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:42.260]
Jones jets were billion style influenced everyone from pinky tuss could narrow unhappy days to

[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:48.120]
Well nobody else actually okay, so I wasn't that influential fight me clearly

[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.140]
We needed another angle for a profile of Jones yet

[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:56.260]
Well, she did start her career with the all female rock band the runaways

[01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:59.320]
Hey, there's something the lesbian angle

[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:06.540]
We asked Joan about the wild nights of girl and girl action that must surely have resulted when the runaways were on tour

[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:08.260]
Hey, that sh** never happened

[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:12.300]
Oh, you are way out of line sure Jones jet can deny it

[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.900]
She still collecting royalties from her hit song

[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.200]
But the other members of the runaways aren't doing so well

[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:24.360]
So when we paid them to admit to having same sex encounters of Jones yet they readily complied

[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:29.080]
former runaway leader Ford oh, yes, I explored the neither reach

[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:34.660]

[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:50.740]
Jones jet

[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:55.340]

Madrid Spain the US president's brother jet bush is part criticism after mistakenly referring to Spain as a republic

[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:27.100]
In a speech to the Spanish business leaders during a trip to Madrid to discuss business opportunities

[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:31.540]
Florida governor jet bush's blunder was reminiscent of president bush's past slip ups

[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:35.420]
Which have included pronouncing Spanish premonster Jose Maria asnard's name incorrectly

[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:40.180]
Spanish historian Juan Pablo Fuzzi said the era by bush was foolish and grotesque

[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.420]
Fulish and grotesque

[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:48.720]
It's an offense to Spain and its democratic monarchy Fuzzi told Reuters it's further it further rituals the Bushes in general

[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:54.580]
Bush the Florida governor was in Madrid to promote the state to Spanish businesses and to meet Prime Minister asnard

[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:59.560]
Speaking in Spanish bush said I want to thank the president of the Republic of Spain for his friendship with the US

[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:06.140]
Spain is not been in republic since the late 1930s when general Francisco Franco crushed Republican troops in the Civil War

[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:12.160]
Franco's nationalist dictatorship lasted until his death in 1975 when Spain became a constitutional

[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:17.780]
King Juan Carlos one is not head of the state his older brother president bush once referred to as now as an czar

President Bush accused by opponents of having a shaky grasp on geographies also famously referred to Greeks as grations

[01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:35.660]
Although we do like their formula for hair loss don't we or for her a color whatever it is

He once had a shiver through jittery stock markets when he was speaking about the deflation in the Japanese yen

[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:45.360]
It accidentally said the evaluation which led to a brief rush to sell the un-international currency markets

[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:47.880]
the evaluation deflation you know

[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:49.740]

[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:17.180]
Along list of credit card companies say a hacker breach the security system of a company that processes transactions to get a customer count information

[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:20.440]
American express would said there are no signs of fraudulent use yet

Will not disclose how many accounts were involved with the company joins visa master card those two said a combined 5.6 million of their account numbers

[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:30.020]
We're subject to the breach or like to all of almost 8 million

[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:35.260]
Makes it a little bit nervous. Don't if you have any credit cards. Of course in Georgia's case and it Carlos's case

[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.720]
Carlos's case who the hell are we kid?

[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:52.400]
Almond brittle and corn dogs

[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:58.340]
Or yeah, no they do care about corn dogs which I think so I care about the dog that's lost on the ice there in the Pasek river new jersey

[01:18:58.340 --> 01:18:59.740]
I'm concerned about him

[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:03.120]
Corn dogs you can have mister. I don't want them

[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.160]
Fé

[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:09.000]
My grandma that told me a long time ago corn dogs are for goyem

[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:14.920]
Who'd be the happiest if Neil croaked mohaw are dated and would dance on eels grave 181 59%

[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:19.400]
Do we get any calls by the way sin at the most showers a show or sounding a lot better?

[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:23.880]
No since the babysitters were there because I made the comment and Carlos agreed

[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:28.560]
But I get the feeling that our people are not listening in the morning. Oh Carlos is a sick offend anyway

[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.460]
I forgot

[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.260]

I've just changed again. Let's see if you and Dennis are still duking it out. No, I think I'm winning

[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:42.020]
Well, if we wouldn't that and jeez what's going on? Oh, there it is it is

[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.500]
pretty slow there

[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:48.640]
Oh, yeah, you're pulling away George in second place 45 Dennis the chronic asshole 36

[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:53.920]
And by the way, Dennis see I guess he felt compelled to call in because his name was on a pull so since he did call in

[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:57.500]
You would have thought that if this weren't true. He would have said oh, yeah

[01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:00.340]
Well, I disagree with a lot of what you say, but I certainly wouldn't want to see you croak

[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:04.540]
You know if he were any kind of a guy since he's such a good Catholic and I'm such a degenerate piece of crap

[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:09.620]
You know what I'm saying? Yeah, but he didn't say that maybe he's gonna go to confess and steady took another cheap shot

[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:13.840]
Just hoping he might help to inflict another stroke. Maybe the fatal one the fatal blow

Sex abuse suit filed in Missouri oh

[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:13.400]
Two former Roman Catholic priests including the brother of a prominent advocate for clergy abuse victims

[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:17.220]
Were sued yesterday by a man who contends to men molested him for most of his childhood

Neither Gary Poole nor Kevin Clohecy has been criminally charged also named as plaintiffs with the diocese of Jefferson City

Retired bishop Michael McCullough and bishop John Gados who heads the diocese

[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:39.140]
Are you believing some of these nail lines?

[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.140]

His phone number is not listed and his brother don't know how to get a hold of him

[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:04.700]
So to speak

[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:12.560]
In Utah two brothers filed an 80 million dollar lawsuit yesterday claiming they were abused in the 1970s by a priest teaching at the Catholic high school in Salt Lake City

[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:16.780]
The priest is currently serving a 40-year prison term in Oklahoma for sex abuse. Oh

[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.380]
The Salt Lake diocese said in the stem in yesterday to learn of the alleged abuse to one victim in November

[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:29.460]
2000 and 2002 that diocese offered pastoral care and reported the allegations to state officials that said in Wisconsin yesterday

[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:35.540]
The Madison diocese announced is paid out $1.6 million to 19 victims of sex abuse in the past two decades

[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:39.740]
Vision William Bullock said that I see is new have documented abuse allegations against four of its priests

[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:44.900]
The diocese serves nearly 265,000 Catholics in 11 southwestern Wisconsin counties

[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:48.040]
And notice what a tremendous job they done and put this all back under the carpet again

[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:48.740]

[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:54.700]

[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:57.480]
Stuff like that important things and whether they got enough

[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.080]

But guys who are in the cats I have a real problem with that. Do you know any guys who are in the cats? Book of Brian

[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:54.000]
Like I said strange guys are in the cats

[01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:58.120]
Speaking of women here's a lady in bokeh hello

[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:02.240]
Hey, hi me. How are you? Okay, I want to thank you

[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:06.720]
I'm one of the maybe few people that love the articles you pick out

[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:13.240]
In fact, I get the one that reads those okay, huh? You're the one that reads them. Yeah, they're a few of us

[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:17.460]
I don't know where you find some of them. I look at some of the headings and I put them on my

[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:24.620]
favorite style, but I see some of them from the New York Times, but some of the other places the sources are great

[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:25.920]
I'd never find them

[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:31.280]
So thank you mom's glad I'm delighted because I always wonder if anybody can bother's with them

[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:36.420]
I really do like them of course they're one splendid, but that's the slant I like that's the idea

[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:40.080]
They're enough they're enough or right wing websites out there. We've got to even an up a little bit

[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:44.820]
Got that right. Okay, thanks. Thank you and when you're not there there's nothing up there

[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.940]
There's a big blank space and I don't know

[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:52.740]
So I really look at them almost every day. Well, we're never gonna let coals pull that crap again

[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:55.860]
Thanks a lot have a great day. Thank you very much

[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:58.640]
See she was very nice little on the old side, but that's where it goes

[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:01.060]
I don't think anybody in it first of all young people don't read newspapers

[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:05.760]
So why should I expect them to go to our website and read the bedtime story see that that's another reason

[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.400]
I was reading the bedtime stories here on here

[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:12.660]
Even though it was much more productive than then fumbling through a bunch of really idiotic calls which most of them today have been

[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:17.000]
Uh, but hey, that's what the audience wants give it to a baby. That's what they want

[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:20.740]
They want a rise the old saying goes they want crap

[01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:25.160]
Why don't you give me the book, but oh no, I was imitating one of our colleagues. No, I understand

[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:27.920]
But that's just that's just what they want very sad

[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:31.900]
You can't force feed the public out there. Okay, they want Drek they want kaka

[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:35.300]
That's why a third of the people watching television Monday that watch Joe millionaire

[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:41.720]
Hmm a third of the people are watching TV in this country watch and that country we're watching Joe millionaire

[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:44.600]
It was kind of a turn off that you had all that money. Oh

[01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:48.500]
God was either one of them attractive. No, I mean interesting. No

[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:48.840]
No

[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:54.320]
He was like a dullard. I saw the eclipse. They showed on the news all day yesterday. He's a dullard

[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:59.420]
Not to mention the fact ugly ugly it looks like a retard looks grotesque

[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:03.740]
And she was a meast at best margin like about a two and a half on a scale of 50

[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:11.100]
But it's the hype baby sell the hype forget about the content nobody cares about the content America's not interested in that

[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:15.340]
And again, just like they said there and that's straight right yesterday

[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:21.100]
About the difference between the media approach on what's happening in the world in Europe and what what what were presented with in America

[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:25.100]
And even the difference between a Canadian approach to what the news and what's in America

[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:26.640]
Pablo

[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:34.320]
Feed the American public Pablo and puke and crap and that's what they become well conditioned to most of the newscast

[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:36.760]
Especially local newscast isn't even real news anyway

[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:38.400]
It's kaka

[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:41.380]
puffpieces

[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:46.740]
So maybe they're in Michael Jackson. That's what the American public wants all this other stuff

[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:50.580]
It's going on a good try and get me to blow the guy damn world up. Wow, but me like that

[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:57.900]
5670 560 pond what am I getting excited about it? I don't know. What's the point? I'm not gonna change it

[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:02.600]
I can go back and read the bed times there is if you didn't do it like ten times the work I'm doing now

[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:06.480]
And well, why don't put about a tenth of the number what's the point? They don't want that

[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:11.540]
But like I said living and breeding people don't read newspapers and certainly aren't looking at the they're too busy on

[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:15.100]
Pornocytes to wonder on the internet. They don't have time to read the final what's going on in the world

[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:21.820]
Although like I said the one promising thing was in a big protest over the weekend with the millions of people who marched against war over the weekend

[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:26.260]
An enormous percentage of those people were like 20 something and even under 20s

[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:27.600]
So maybe there's some hope

[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:33.400]
1056 at 560 WDQM there's some hope for your carpets even if they look like they're hopeless

[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.740]
They may look really bad really schmutzy and desperate

[01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:40.600]
In fact, you know something that's that's one of the most impressive things is when your carpets do look and smell really bad

[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:43.480]
Is that dry concepts come in and chuck the crap out of you

[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:45.200]
They get all the crap out of your carpeting

[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:47.920]
They suck out the deep dung dirt by dry cleaning your carpets

[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:50.300]
They're the only people in the world who do this. It's a patented method

[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:52.860]
And when they get done your carpets look just like brand new

[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:58.080]
They smell em and he fresh they're drying a couple of hours and you're just standing there with an amazed look on your post like

[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:00.000]
How can these carpets look like brand new?

[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:04.320]
But I guarantee you they will and I should know I've been using dry concepts in my house for well over 20 years now

[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:07.820]

Stuff these are the people do a stupid job for you

For example if you have pet odors if you have like a little dog like mine it leaves his mark everywhere around the house

[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:23.300]
Or milder odors caused by water damage. They'll make those disappear like magic

Nothing so we're left with corn dogs

[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.920]
I guess quite frankly. I don't want to be spread on desert. I don't really have people in Saudi

[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:26.180]
Corn dogs is the best they can come up with

[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:30.380]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:35.680]
pound 5 60 on the 18 and T in Verizon wireless line

[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:40.500]
Just hope your feeding better. It says as you say there's no place to walk around the golf course and plantation

[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:43.320]
Feel better to stay healthy a lot of cabbage and Brussels sprouts. Yeah

[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:49.400]
By the way at 3 20 PM yesterday Hank blurted out the effort then he said it was the medication that did it

[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:53.940]
PR routes to screw you George which I'm sure he says with love and kisses of course

[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:58.480]
He blurted out the effort. How come we're not getting any spire ports about what's going on with that stuff?

[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:04.400]
Huh? Good question, but that can be put in place. It's so tight lipped about what's going on there that it's supposed to be a big secret

[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.960]
Because they know that if I found out I'll put it out on the air yeah

[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:10.480]
Because the public deserves to know about these things aren't you on medication?

[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:13.320]
Yes, so if you blurted out the f word

[01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:16.220]
Well, if you how do you like that? Huh?

[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:23.240]
5 6 7 0 5 60 we got one hour till noon. Okay, let's see if this audience can do it. What do you say? They don't have to be good

[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:27.380]
We sure like to hear first of all Carlos keeps putting all these I mean that lady was nice

[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:28.500]
Even though she was a hundred years old

[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:31.080]
She was very nice because she at least reads the bedtime stories

[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:34.920]
Which made Carlos feel it's worthwhile all the effort he has to go through to put them on there

[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.040]
Takes him at least about 20 minutes every day

[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:38.760]
Don't get it started

[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:43.480]
What do you mean by that? Well the procedure changed but we don't want to talk about that you just relax

[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:46.200]
We don't want to give you another stroke. I'm not getting involved in the middle of it

[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:49.560]
Exactly because we have because we have because you're in a psycho a psycho

[01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:55.560]
Computer needs to say don't ever call me again Eric. I'm telling you right now be the biggest mistake you ever made in your life

[01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:59.980]
Another thing he does when he calls here like when he was doing it last time. I was here

[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:02.800]
In fact, I think that's set the stage for my stroke

[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:08.240]
I pick up the phone. Hi, you know, hi like like I'm expecting to hear from him

[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:08.680]
You know what I mean?

[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:14.060]
Like I should be expecting his call. What am I going to do for him? What does he need me for?

[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:19.820]
You think that a guy who like jeopardized their entire livelihoods on his program not too many months ago

[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:22.140]
You think that he would like really be to on the line real tight

[01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:26.040]
But when you're that big and fat it's hard to total line. Can you see him doing like a tight rope into circus?

[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:30.500]
Huh? Oh, I bet your Carlos would pay lots to see that it would be tight

[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:32.740]
Here's color rage hello

[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:34.760]
Yes, sir

[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:40.660]
Yeah, I'm moving on high on I just wanted to thank you for all the good times through all the bomb hits and

[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.860]
I don't know man. I don't know if you

[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:49.300]
Stand my amy so much. I can't wait to get that all out of here. That's why I'm here man. I love Toronto

[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:54.300]
All right, thanks for everything god bless you. Good luck to pal. Thank you. Bye. Bye

[01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:59.640]
Here's your guys leaving. Let's hear it for him. Okay. That's the goal of most people with a brain in software

[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:03.380]
Of course people that you know don't know any better. Oh, this is paradise paradise. Yeah

[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:10.280]
When I left there was like 87 88 degrees every day in the early February. What the hell is that the middle of February 88 90 degrees? That's winter

[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:11.200]
Yeah

[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:16.020]
Little bit too hot and salty and too many of the allergies and the mold and the stuff like that

[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:22.240]
I would say yesterday not that anybody seems to care but yesterday I turned the corner as far as the stroke thing is concerned

[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:29.300]
I mean, it's then by next Monday. I'm predicting that'll be like back to abnormal for me. Okay good because it takes a couple of weeks

[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:34.380]
But yesterday I stopped would like the that sensation that just a little bit of it now you know the headache

[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:37.660]
A brainy like you know I'm talking. Oh, I don't know

[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:41.700]
Well, you don't want to know don't go right out. No, I don't advise you don't ever have a stroke

[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:47.140]
All right, and let me say one other thing too since I got mentioned about smoking smoking and stroking mm-hmm

[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:52.320]
Uh, those little cigarettes remember what I had those little cigars right it's still having had one but I'm saying

[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:58.340]
What did I tell you about those? What was that complaining about right that my your whole head feels like it's full of a

[01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:03.260]
Smoking like you're in a fog. Hey Derek. Don't bring anymore those little cigars to the track you jackass

[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:10.300]
You mean well, but you're a killer man and the cherry flavor which makes it taste good is extra oh poisonous poison

[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.000]
Those things and again because they're small you chain smoke them like cigarettes right oh god

[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:22.140]
During a course of night at the track I'd sit there and smoke five or eight or ten of those goddamn thing good Lord

[01:43:22.140 --> 01:43:24.880]
By the time I left there was like you know fog, you know

[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:29.000]
I had the two over to one five six or the nine over the seven I I didn't know what that was going on

[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.840]
I didn't know Brian Sears from Sears and Robock

[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:36.500]
But that's just the way it goes, you know no more of those damn little Stogies Derek

[01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:42.400]
How many how many people do we know all of us who are trying to kill us with kindness

[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:49.920]
The food pushers mm-hmm the cigar pushers or you still smoking Stogies no no, I'm not well you are now

Doesn't matter what you say you still smoking cigars. No, well here's some anyway. No, I'm not

[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:03.260]
I see what you're saying. No, I'm not no more those did I smoke any of those in that pack? I didn't even open it

[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:08.780]
I gave you the package unopened and it's pristine form with the plastic condom still on it

[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:16.340]
Here's a call from Kendall. Hello good show guys. Yeah, that's it. That's not me. Oh, that's more on again

[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:28.700]

[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:32.660]
Yeah, no

[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:41.180]
Let me ask you a question sir. Yes, sir. Do I know you personally? No, why would you call me that?

[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:45.320]
Why would you call me by my real? I don't go by that name on air, but nobody calls me that except my relives

[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:49.420]
I've always wondered why do people do that when they call his show. What what is the attraction?

[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:51.500]
They want your real name come on. What do you prefer?

[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:57.740]
I prefer being called Neil or whatever the hell you want or asshole or anything like that, but not miles. Okay

[01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:01.340]
It's just stupid. Why do people do that?

[01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:05.640]
I don't know. Maybe it makes me feel like I've been getting myself people obviously. I'm not

[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:09.960]
No, I apologize. No, you're alienating yourself from the human race, but go ahead

[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:12.760]
I just want to say that

[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:15.760]
I wanted to thank George W. Bush for

[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.560]
Basically taking us from being a laughing stock in the world to being

[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:23.800]
perceived as the bully warm-ongering country of the world and

[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:30.380]
Democrats better get the crap together and find somebody that doesn't want to make it puke

[01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:33.720]
Or we're really asked if you know what I mean. Okay

[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:36.600]
Thanks Neil. Okay. Oh Canada

[01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:41.140]
Bush blocks deal allowing cheap drugs for the world's poor by the way. So this is the British

[01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:42.680]
A newspaper the Guardian

[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:48.000]
George Bush is close links with the drugs industry were last night. This is today's paper by the way

[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:53.380]
So it is last I blame for the failure of toxin Geneva aimed at securing access to cheap medicines for developing countries

[01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:58.460]
Delegates that the world trade organization expressed frustration that the US again rejected the deal

[01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:04.160]
That would have loosened global patent rules to enable poor countries to import cheap copies of desperately needed drugs

[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:10.020]
We believe that governments should maintain their distance and should not be directed by pressure groups one EU trade officials said

[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:16.000]
Negotiator said a solution to the dead likely in America's hands the pharmaceuticals lobby is running the show in Washington

[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.920]
One development activist said

[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:22.460]
The pharmaceuticals lobby in Washington is running the show and not only that

[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:27.800]
But since I am in Canada I should mention to you any of you people have bought your prescription drugs on the web on the internet

[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:31.100]
You're familiar with that aren't you a lot of the companies up there?

[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:35.600]
We're some prescription drugs had much reduced prices and not gouging the public like they do all over America

[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:38.900]
Well guess what the drug companies got together and they said well

[01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:41.840]
We're not gonna supply with any of our drugs anymore unless you quit doing that

[01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:42.660]
Right

[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:44.980]
So we're not gonna let the American consumer

[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:50.240]
Have a get any kind of a break. We're gonna continue gouging and raping you as opposed to like up here

[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:55.600]
We're even by a leg over to counter so Claretons over to counter down there Clareton was over to counter here for years

[01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:59.660]
The price of prescription drugs here is a fraction of what it is in America

[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:04.700]
Why is it that the public continues to want to be raped and pillaged by these rich assholes?

[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:07.460]
I don't get it and speaking of being raped and pillaged

[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.700]
Where's that other store which I'm sure is on the website Florida Attorney General calls for US

[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:13.700]
They didn't have to be on the website's in the Sunsendal

[01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:18.040]
Florida Attorney General calls for US inquiry to soaring gas prices

[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:27.540]
The state attorney general wants federal investigators to find out whether Florida gas stations are taking advantage of the threatened war in the middle east to artificially drive up prices

[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:30.040]
And that really calls for investigation you know what

[01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:34.080]
Don't you think we ought to explain this for me check it on that. It's a very big mystery

[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:38.980]
We have no idea what the answer is attorney general Charlie Christ Jesus Christ. Oh Charlie Christ

[01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:44.240]
Asked the FTC on Tuesday to investigate the recent dramatic spike in gas prices

[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:53.020]
Florida's average cost per gallon for regular gasoline yesterday was a buck 66 up 19 cents from month earlier and 56 cents more than a cost

[01:47:53.020 --> 01:47:54.980]
E.R. Go currently American Automobile Association

[01:47:55.660 --> 01:48:01.920]
It's the highest average price ever in Florida and now three cents more than the national average at the time of the year when gas prices are usually lower

[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:04.540]
Triple A said because it's not like the height of the tourist season

[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:10.780]
In soft Florida gas prices are even higher the averages between the bucks six bucks 70 and bucks 72 and brown

[01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:12.800]
Data in Palm Beach counties triple A said

[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:20.040]
I'm concerned that some companies or retailers are taking advantage of the impending crisis to increase their profits by unjustifiably

[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:25.480]
Ricing prices quest set and letter the FTC commissioner Timothy J. Muiros and it goes on and on and on

[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:33.980]
More tax cuts for the wealthy for the big corporations. They continue raping the public the pharmaceutical companies all in bed with the big politicians of both parties

[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:36.540]
And the public keeps going little more like that

[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.980]
And you know what I think I think Moe had a point

[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:45.680]
Was how when he said gang rape is funny because that's what's happening in America

[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:48.240]
That's exactly how to describe it. Thanks Moe

[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:49.740]

[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:47.600]
Clarence is a hard-ass and there's afraid that they're gonna take away some of the thunder from the QAM website

[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:51.780]
Even though they have their own webcam and they do something that's totally different from the sports nerds

[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:55.720]
The other 16 or 18 hours of the day. Yeah, that's them. Oh, I thought so

[01:50:57.180 --> 01:50:59.660]
560 560 quit being a hard-ass class course

[01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:05.220]
Part of the sportsocracy in our radio station as much as we like him on payday, which is only a week from yesterday

[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:10.120]
As much as we like him on the 10th and 25th of each month the rest of the time a little on a marginal side

[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:13.600]
All clearance because of the fact he's part of a sports mafia at QAM

[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:16.020]
He's part of the problem not part of the answer. You know what I'm saying?

[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:21.220]
No, what are you saying? So when you call the board of station to tell me you're feeling better and he answers the phone sports

[01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:25.340]
Even though it's supposed to be the program director's office you say to yourself. Oh

Everything you need to know exactly. That's right in like a in a fraction of a second that one sports

[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:34.720]
That's all I needed no in case I hadn't already learned it

[01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:40.740]
Here's a call from Hollywood. Hello. Hey Neil. How are you doing? Are you okay? Um, I'm sorry

[01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:43.740]
I just soon did I believe you during Canada now is that correct? Yes

[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:46.840]
Okay, so you probably did not see what I saw if I have a news

[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:49.180]
I don't know if someone told you about about the mold and the duct

[01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:52.860]
No, okay, well, it was that moldy ducts

[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:59.920]
There was a special on one of the the news reports or something I find about mold and the ducts the air ducts and the air conditioning bands and so forth

[01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:05.820]
And I heard you talk about it before on your station that you had a problem in the actual studio or the station or whatever

[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:08.540]
I was sure you do we got a bad problem in your fact when I come back

[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:14.040]
I'm getting a I'm getting one of those type of filters for the room. I was actually curious because I'm I am my family

[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:17.620]
I had a lot of cold lately and I was just curious if you you know I've heard you talk about dry concepts

[01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:21.000]
I know they do carpets. I don't know if they do that or not. Do you know? No, no they don't

[01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:23.980]
Okay, I just had one other thing you know my no change the channel here

[01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:25.200]
This lady

[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:25.900]
Elephant

[01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:28.740]
Whatever name is elephant the lady

[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:31.020]
That's very old. I know

[01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:34.060]
Can you please explain to me something how in the

[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:36.660]
Which does she keep her job?

[01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:39.920]
They found a hundred ballots or a box of ballots or something

[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:44.020]
You know, you know the answer to the question because they've got everybody intimidated now

[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:46.200]
They black pressure groups have got everybody intimidated

[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:51.420]
And even though there was the pulled on the paper a day that says that more than two-thirds of the people say she's incompetent

[01:52:51.420 --> 01:52:55.940]
But the pressure groups have got her in there and they're holding her hand now in each one of these small

[01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:59.040]
Municipal elections to make sure she doesn't screw up again anytime soon

[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:02.120]
And they're keeping her in there even though they know damn well that she's incompetent

[01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:03.160]
Well, you know I

[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:08.140]
Makes no sense because if I live in my job and I would screw up like that

[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:14.760]
Obviously, I'd be fired but I just got to explain to why why it is that's that's the way it is with minorities in the US

[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:19.800]
So if you happen to me the right might already you have to have the happen to have the right people behind you

[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:21.100]
You got a job for life

[01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:24.120]
Well, I can practically go out and kill somebody before you lose your job

[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:28.200]
Speaking of the minority thing my graduate from college in 1991 and it came down here

[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:32.860]
I tried to get a job with custom and I went to the first interview and find second interview and find

[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:37.760]
I came back for the third interview and I went to lock into the waiting area for the third interview

[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:40.580]
There were three black women applying for the same job as I did

[01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:43.240]
Let's see who's not gonna get this job, huh?

[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:46.120]
There you go. Okay, good luck for me. I'll start with you. Okay

[01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:52.800]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 we got a million open lines here in this hour trying to make another 39 minutes here

[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:54.160]
Do you think we can do it? I have my doubts

[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.660]
We can do it. You have your doubts? No

[01:53:56.660 --> 01:54:02.760]
I just keep shaking my head and shake Canada says it will not join solo US attack on Iraq

[01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:07.840]

Which really scares the crap out of all of us

[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:18.040]
Gas chemical ship to North Korea

[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:22.340]
That's promising see we don't want to talk about these things because they're too depressing

[01:54:22.340 --> 01:54:27.040]
That's why we just put them on a website come with us people want to be depressed then they can go to ready.gov

[01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:32.760]
And then get already they get all prepared they can get out there a duct tape and they're our viscene

[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:37.380]
And this little queen and they can just lock themselves in a house and hide under the bed forever

[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:42.500]
Even though they haven't got any idea what's coming when it's coming if it's coming it's Ederman so on

[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:48.340]
I mean when you really stop and think about how easy the public is here the fact that everybody got scared the crap

[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:52.520]
Bottom with his orange alert with its increase in the terror alert and come to fight out that most of it

[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:58.440]
Not all of it most of it was based on a bunch of lies about one of the al-Qaeda prisoners who failed the lie detector test

[01:54:58.900 --> 01:54:59.300]
Well

[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:05.320]

You know, he's handsome. I compared to a competitor who compared to a long-chainy junior. Yeah, he's a good

[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:28.900]
I'm a person voting for good looking guys and vote for interested voting for somebody with a brain

[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:32.100]
Of course, but I'm saying the women are gonna vote, you know

Fear of value is let's do the requirement thing look what did for that just took to two seconds there

[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:58.300]
You're such a hard-ass man the guy would like to hear instead of keep going over to CNBC

[01:56:58.300 --> 01:57:03.620]
In fact, if we can keep people off of CNBC if we could have kept all of us off CNBC a lot of us would be retired by now

[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:08.580]
That's right the gambling channel bunch of fakers. They still say they all belong in jail

[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:13.020]
And again the public just oh gee. What was us, you know, we're bad luck

[01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:17.280]
It wasn't bad luck. It was fraud. We got defrauded man. We've been had

[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:21.660]
And the public just sits back and they do just what the government knows that they're gonna do

[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:25.080]
They don't do a goddamn thing and we'll let the finger and a few million people around the world

[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:28.600]
Get out there and protest in the freezing cold on the over the weekend. That's it

[01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:32.360]
And the rest of the public sits back and little little little one times do a minute there

[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:35.000]
Ha ha good small for last night by the way

[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:41.600]

Oh, tonight on the year. I don't get it. I'm sorry. I mean it is one thing to be a sports station

[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:11.920]
Another thing to have like a sports illness like a disease QA is made sports into a disease

[01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:14.080]
Like a mental illness

[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:19.380]

[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:04.680]
heterosexual men for whatever reason

[02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:09.980]
I'm still a maybe because they're so terrorized traumatized by their wives their girlfriends their mothers are all of the above

[02:01:09.980 --> 02:01:12.700]
Have this deep-seated hatred of women

[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:15.100]
It's got one biggest bag

[02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:20.520]
Is that it? Well, that's one reason. Well, that is one of many reasons of course in your mother's case

[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:23.460]
We don't have a lot of have no more but at any rate

[02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:30.120]
So that's really what that's all about is this uh with this misogynistic just obnoxious hate all women kind of thing

[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:31.760]
I like it. It's really uh, whatever

[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:36.060]
Why do we speak to a woman? Why are we supposed to care about lacy Peterson?

[02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:40.980]
They had that meeting and decided we're supposed to care about herself. I see

[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:44.760]
Well, I don't want to be left out on the limb again, but I guess you know, why not?

[02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:48.820]
I don't care about lacy Peterson. I don't wish you're pregnant. I don't wish her any harm

[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:50.600]
She was pregling and all this other stuff

[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:57.160]
But I mean there's so many missing women and so many missing children thousands and thousands and we never hear about any of the rest

[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:01.440]
The mix of maybe on John Walsh's show or something like that. No, by the way, is his show still on? Yeah

[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:08.300]
I don't know what it's on, but I see promo is known and I guess I'm like I think between four and five or five and six in the afternoon

[02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:10.840]
Something like that. I saw like about two minutes of it once

[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:16.340]
I mean America's most wanted is still on techie or because that's a good show, but uh, I don't know about that

[02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:20.740]
But anyway, we hear a little bit about that, but lacy Peterson. They decided is the next Sean relieving

[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:26.820]
Right and her husband. What does his name Scott? I don't yeah, I guess they were hyperventilating yesterday

[02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:28.740]
We think with all the stuff that's going on in the world

[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:34.200]
You know, we're on the verge of blowing the world up between Iraq and North Korea and Iran and all these other crazy people and George W

[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:36.200]
And they're going on about oh

[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:42.520]
Breathless they have to interrupt that MSNBC about how oh it's god Peterson was just served again another reward for a

[02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:49.980]
Another search warrant not arrested not charged with any crime another search warrant. How do you like that? Oh

[02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:53.780]
That pretty exciting. I feel better. No, man

[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:59.620]
I don't care about lacy Peterson. I'm very sorry in spite of the fact the news media tells me I'm supposed to be how many times

[02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:03.100]
I told you people that's the problem or one of the many problems of the news media America

[02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:08.100]
They tell you what you're supposed to be concerned about this is important. No, it's not. No, it's important

[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:12.280]
Anyway, here's a fact from George a different George says hey Neil

[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:17.640]
I'm vendure came out okay from the stroke you had recently. I was wondering if there's anything you want to do before you croak

[02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:23.760]
Is there anybody you'd like to do? Yeah, I'm gonna go question. Oh, I say

[02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:27.060]
Yes, there are and I'm working on it feverously. Okay. There are a lot of people I like to do

[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:35.220]
Does I know you've traveled the world of enjoyed many luxury such as your sports cars? What's missing in your life to make it complete George asks?

[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:41.060]
Hey, that's a good list building pole idea. What do you mean by that? What do you want to do before you croak?

[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:45.680]
Who do you want to do before you croak? Well take that option out of I don't know their names necessarily right

[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:52.760]
P.S. Do you still have your Corvette? Yes. He's to love talks about them and the NSX is wondering if you might consider having a pull on America's favorite sports car

[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:58.780]
No, that will definitely give you lots of materials instead of the movie musicals for change fast cars and women are always on men's mind

[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:02.760]
What do you think George? No

[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:11.520]
Thank you anyway George a lot of George is around you know what five six seven oh five sixty pond five sixty only eighteen and tea

[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:15.080]
Actually one of the things I look forward to tremendously is retirement. Oh, huh

[02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:19.460]
In like three years ten and a half months, but who's counting?

[02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:27.100]
A little less than ten and a half months right that's what I look forward to I like to get out of this radio station alive

[02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:31.940]
That's all and believe me surviving Greg Reed alive is a major accomplishment

[02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:40.720]
Because the long line of bodies who have perished both physically and spiritually under the Greg Reed regime is just legendary

[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:41.660]
It's just unbelievable

[02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:46.420]
Arbitron survey backs US radio consolidations. You want to say where that is?

[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:52.040]
A radio listener survey released yesterday bolstered acclaimed by major US radio chains and industry

[02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:58.180]
Consolvation has proved more provided more local flavor and diversity in programming drawing criticism that it was biased

[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:05.300]
Report by Arbitron radio survey company found that listeners were very pleased with the programming choices available to them

[02:05:05.300 --> 02:05:10.720]
About 79% that they got more or the same amount of programming choices from local radio than they did five years ago

[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:16.120]
I'm going to be sick skeptic said the report was biased as it came from a company whose businesses perpetuated

[02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:18.600]
By the growth of big radio company profits

[02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:23.940]
The federal government is in the process of evaluating changes and potentially allowing further consolidation

[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:28.860]
While the broadcast industry has an obvious agenda to defend these changes and push for more said Michael

[02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:36.080]
Bracy legislative director for the future of music coalition artist and consumerry and to think think it's clearly in their best interest to say that radio is great

[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:40.900]
He said even though all of us know that it sucks the big one. Okay. It bites. It blows

[02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:47.480]
And South Florida is living proof of it radio and South Florida blows. It's a piece of crap man

[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:52.020]
It's like a steamy floating turd like the one that that brought fun in the backseat of her car

[02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:57.780]
That's what it is a big smelly steamy turd

[02:05:57.780 --> 02:06:02.220]
Every single market in America here's dr. Laura here's Lordass here's uh uh

[02:06:02.220 --> 02:06:07.780]
Jordan Lydia all the same goddamn shows all the same prefabricated music formats

[02:06:09.340 --> 02:06:09.700]
crap

[02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:18.040]
Because they have a lot of a handful. I mean you could count about the fingers of one hand of companies to own the overwhelming majority of all the stations and now now they're saying oh well

[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:18.860]
I didn't go far enough

[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:21.100]
Let them own airy station

[02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:24.300]
So you can hear the same speed them and crap all over the place

[02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:29.420]
So that not only for the people listening but also the people in this industry it's just like this Greg Reid thing

[02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:33.700]
They know damn well where else are you gonna go you gonna go work for David Ross and Cheat Channel?

[02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:35.420]
No, that's why they jerk everybody around

[02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:41.420]
Besides the fact that they're cheap and they're always paying a rob and Peter to pay Paul and to pay all these outrageous sports franchise fees

[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:47.100]
You know why they pay all the sports uh franchise fees sports. Yeah, that's it

[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:52.960]
So Greg Reid can be a sports maven oh we can have the heat we can have this and we have yeah and and

[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:53.720]
And what about it?

[02:06:55.700 --> 02:06:58.300]
Are they making a lot of money with those things? No other than a dolphins

[02:06:58.300 --> 02:06:59.960]
You show me anything on this radio station

[02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:04.060]
It's making them a lot of money has anything to do with sports and I'll show you a guy damn cow in a Chinese shop

[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:06.120]
Forget about it

[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:06.360]
um

[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:12.400]
5 6 7 0 5 60 we got it's corn dog Wednesday if you I am

[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:14.620]
Tomorrow be cornhole Thursday

[02:07:16.460 --> 02:07:20.360]
And then glory whole Friday come up this Friday here's keep a scheme hello

[02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:25.740]
Very good here's crawl springs hello

[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:27.220]
Oh

[02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:35.120]
Nobody there either okay down to two let's see we got what 22 minutes to go I don't think two calls gonna cut it for quite early right right five six seven oh five sixty

[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:38.460]
pound five sixty see they're trying to prove to me that they have nothing to say

[02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:44.160]
And the same handful of the same handful of little see that's why for anybody that missed it about you're going

[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:46.020]
At this time just a little bit beyond that right

[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:51.540]
Is when I started to schmit can and the goddamn phone calls going all the bedtime stories and I still say I don't care

[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:56.700]
What any of you say see I it's much easier to do this for me talk to a bunch of mouth readers on the phone without a doubt

[02:07:56.700 --> 02:07:58.900]
Just parts of the book those shows were so much more productive

[02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:04.300]
I felt so much more like accomplishing something when I finished them and I'm not supposed to accomplish anything

[02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:05.720]
Is what I've learned in that last year

[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:11.140]
What I'm supposed to accomplish is sit here and talk to a bunch of simple things because the other people find it entertaining

[02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:16.660]
The other people who don't read the newspapers no read the bedtime stories they don't want to hear that crap

[02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:19.760]
They're not interested in that crap

[02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:23.220]
Look at even today even out of the corn dog. What does that tell you?

[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:29.900]
That it's special we didn't play the right game today. That was the problem. We didn't give them the right toy to play with today

[02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:35.340]
If there were a way to know here's pop it. Oh, hello Neil. Yes, sir. Hi

[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:38.300]
Hey, uh, it was watching the sports center

[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:43.820]
That you know my Tyson's having a fight this weekend. You don't know. Yes. Yes. What pal? We don't care

[02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:48.880]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line. Here's Vokit. Hello

[02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:51.260]
Hello, yes, sir

[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:55.680]
Oh, I'm in trying for four days. I know that the uh

[02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:56.820]
Paul is over

[02:08:56.820 --> 02:08:59.440]
I'm not sent school stupid movies

[02:09:00.060 --> 02:09:07.140]
But the king of all time was Don Johnson's debut in a boy in his book. You remember that one already talked about that

[02:09:07.140 --> 02:09:12.760]
Are you did? Yeah, I'm a limited driver and I'm in and out of the car, but I listen to you every single day

[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:16.700]
Well, thank god for you, man. Okay, I just I didn't hear you mention that

[02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:24.840]
But I thought it was the stupidest but the king of all time stupid movies you did I did I thought it was a great movie

[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:25.880]
Yeah

[02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:31.060]
When they surprised them that he can't go to bed with all the women he has to have a mechanical

[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:37.000]
Mershavation machine. Yeah, he had a little tube going. Yeah. Yeah, that was a that that brought me up

[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.680]
I was thought about that movie for years

[02:09:39.180 --> 02:09:45.980]
Anyway, I think your show is great. It's great to have something different out of year and I agree with you with more with the morning

[02:09:45.980 --> 02:09:51.100]
I hear him go on at six o'clock and whatever time he goes on and I shut him right away

[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:59.840]
I can't wait. I really can't wait for you to come on at nine o'clock, but I wish you'd go back to spend that's kind of how I feel

[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:01.720]
I can't wait to one o'clock. Okay, I have a great day

[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:03.960]
You too. Thank you

[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:07.580]
Hey, I'd like to go back to 10 to 2 also, but to see they created this problem now

[02:10:07.580 --> 02:10:10.940]
They don't know how to fix it. They don't know how to sort. Uh, you know, follow what I'm saying. Yeah, I know

[02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:14.400]
They know how to make it right. That's Greg read for it like it's a Humpty Dumpty thing

[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:18.080]
You know all the king's horses and all the king's asses couldn't put it together again. That's you Greg

[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:24.080]
Nice job point to figure out everybody else try to throw everybody else out of the bus for your own bad moves Greg

[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:28.540]
Not full on this kid. Not for a minute and by the way, why do you write a gift norm is check? Okay?

[02:10:29.020 --> 02:10:30.600]
Quit playing games with people's money

[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:40.080]
One of the things I love about this company is that people that when they make you wait for a check and they finally get the check and they'll get the check and they'll look and see that it was dated like two months before

[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:43.560]
Yeah, but it didn't have the little squiggle on the bottom. In other words

[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:46.320]
Uh, it's the Robin Peter to pay Paul thing again

[02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:52.420]
So you hold back a bunch of checks long enough and keep checking at bank account to see if they can give this one his bonus check and pay this one for the

[02:10:52.420 --> 02:10:57.040]
Marlins games see how that works at Q.A.M. Yeah, we're not liquid yet. That's how it works liquid

[02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:01.340]
If you call that liquid, not least part of it sometimes

[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:05.740]
1142 at 560 especially when you work for Greg. In fact a lot of times

[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:11.060]
I want to tell you one more time today that size makes a big difference in spite of what anybody else tells yet

[02:11:11.060 --> 02:11:12.420]
According to the Florida Department of Labor

[02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:18.220]
Computer professionals have big impressive effective paychecks they work and according to these state of Florida

[02:11:18.220 --> 02:11:23.020]
Computer careers are among the highest paid and the highest demand fast-trained can help you achieve that new high paying

[02:11:23.020 --> 02:11:26.300]
Computer career and just four short months. It's a piece of cake

[02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:30.100]
They've got locations all over town. So there's bound to be one fairly convenient to where you be living

[02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:34.360]
They're in Kendall Miami for Lauderdale and Pembroke Pines and they've got day evening weekend schedules

[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:40.760]
So there is absolutely no excuse to stay in a crappy dead end job working for peanuts for some buttplug who scratches his head all day long

[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:44.160]
So call fast train toll free at 1-866 fast train

White boys. I'll have to show you how to store man

[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:45.680]

White boys hiking in my Doc Martyr

I can get the hiking in my Doc Martyr

[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:06.560]
What's up, Noah?

[02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:07.780]
What's up, Noah?

[02:13:07.780 --> 02:13:09.340]
White boys. I can't get the hiking in my Doc Martyr

[02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:11.480]
What's up, Noah?

[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:15.620]
I'm Kevin at 560 WQ and please tell me that I'm having like double vision or something for my stroke

[02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:18.400]
I'm reading this thing wrong what it says on the align there on line 12

[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:20.120]
Yep, that's it.

[02:13:21.900 --> 02:13:22.800]
Hello Jeff.

[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.060]
Yep. I'm just making sure you're still feeling okay

[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:31.880]
But but also I have to thank City furniture because after you helped me they were unbelievable

[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:34.620]
They came right back out six my kids beds

[02:13:34.620 --> 02:13:40.600]
Were polite drivers and give me any hard time. They did an awesome job. I have great furniture

[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:45.100]
All that taking care of City furniture rules. Thank you for your health. Deal

[02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:46.740]
What's happening?

[02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:49.120]
Have a great day, Jeff.

[02:13:49.340 --> 02:13:49.420]
What?

[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:52.840]
Why did you put him on?

[02:13:55.020 --> 02:13:58.440]
I mean we love Jeff Cohen. Good guy. Long time friend and sponsor

[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:02.280]
But you know it the idea that he's just going to use this show as his personal play toy every day

[02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:04.260]
Now that I'm up here that's unacceptable. Carlos

[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:07.020]
You better straighten that little spick out George

[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:08.960]
What do you want me to say?

[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:12.520]
It's stupid. No, not a question of what you say after the show is out over today.

[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:17.340]
Oh, straighten him out. Get a two by four. Get that machete over there to one add some against the wall the OJ one

[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:21.500]
I'll take his toilet treat bag away from it. There you go

[02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:28.240]
Limit his his his preparation for leaving the studio to like 25 minutes and see how he reacts

[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:34.740]
Oh now you're being uh overboard over to your line five six. I can't believe he just did that to me again. Why is he doing that?

[02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:37.020]
Is he losing it?

[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:43.620]
Did I give him a nice uh a wild extended plug yesterday my good friend Jeff Cohen?

[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:50.040]
Oh, that's right you're gonna say anything as you want to keep getting fed for free. I forgot about it

[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:54.220]
I like Jeff Jeff's always been there. I like him too, but I just I find it just appalling

[02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:57.520]
I have no words to describe the shock and the smell

[02:14:58.340 --> 02:15:01.900]
Maybe we don't have like a regular feature on a show of beats most of the other calls we get anyway

[02:15:01.900 --> 02:15:06.260]
We'll just have a regular feature where Jeff calls in and just to use his five minutes of the show every day for free

[02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:08.460]
Why that limited to him you got lots of sponsors

[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:15.380]
The other people don't do that they don't use the show to exploit for fun and profit. They don't do that. Do they?

[02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:18.220]
No, I guess they don't oh

[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:24.040]
Here's hi Aliah. This should be a good call. Hello. What's up, Neil? Yes, sir. I will save you from the corn dog

[02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:29.700]
Yeah, one that I would like and desert island all that I want some red snapper man

[02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:32.440]
Yeah, how bet I'll bet you do

[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:37.000]
I see I thought that was an interesting topic, but you know what the problem is they don't

[02:15:37.660 --> 02:15:39.000]
No, no, that is the problem

[02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:43.400]
But you know what I'm saying in other words they evidently maybe that's only for us real fat people

[02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:45.260]
And since I'm the only fat one connected with the show

[02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:47.940]
Uh, I guess I'm way out of line again

[02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:51.680]
Something that comes up a lot people are always asking that what would you know if you could

[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:56.060]
Be one food if you're a spread out of desert island and you could have as much of it as you want to

[02:15:56.060 --> 02:15:58.940]
But be the only thing you could have that you would we'll keep you happy

[02:15:58.940 --> 02:16:03.700]
We could do all of it. I said Roger's almond brittle because it's the most delicious thing

[02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:06.060]
I've had in years. It's its candy, but it's great

[02:16:06.660 --> 02:16:08.720]
And that's so yeah, you would get sick and die from it

[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:11.680]
But you're gonna get sick and die anyone and desert island where would that's just for fun

[02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:15.700]
All see you say just for fun. They don't want to do that. They don't want to do that

[02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:22.080]
I thought it was an excellent topic, but you know corn dog is the one answer we got in other hours very good

[02:16:22.780 --> 02:16:23.500]
And snapper

[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:28.040]
Well, that's another story at least he didn't say black stone ash like you said

[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:32.320]
459 votes on the pool. What would be the happiest of Neil croaked

[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:35.180]
Moe Howard David had with dance on Neil's grave

[02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:42.480]
262 people 57% of you think that Moe would dance on my grave. Have you ever seen an old man with varicose veins tried to dance?

[02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:47.100]
No, but I'd like to I'd like to let's see him fall down on it and then fight out. I'm not really in there

[02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:54.520]
George is second, but it is in second 75 votes because he thinks he'd get to show if I croak

[02:16:56.340 --> 02:17:01.000]
Dennis the chronic professional Catholic homophobies got 47 both boys sure pulled away from his ass

[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:06.000]
Greg read a real evil newer 21 fox news had their 20 Reverend Kennedy

[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:11.460]
17 of the crawl Ridge Presbyterian Jew and the Fag Hating Church

[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:18.460]
Geli uh eight out of spite Eric no more long pool six and John Gibson a five fox news still has only a small pair

[02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:20.080]
He really is small potatoes, you know

[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:24.840]
John Gibson Fort Lauderdale. Hello

Good afternoon to you almost I'm also a gay hater, but I don't I would yeah, I was Reverend there is Reverend

567056 and we got three or four minutes to kill here and they just can't do it. Can they they can't get it up

[02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:46.180]
We got to put Jeff Cohen on here again to snore the show again

[02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:51.000]
Which I'm just in shock that he would do that again. Don't go having a stroke. No

[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:56.480]
I'm just I'm just not happy. I'm really not happy. They did that you know because I could I could left him just hanging there

[02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:57.700]
That would have been rude, you know

[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:06.940]
He's calm to see if I'm still okay. I'm telling you what call me again about 130 Jeff see if I'm still and then about three and then about four

[02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:08.020]
15 would be good

[02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:13.720]
Don't call between no don't call between three and four cuz passions is on at that time

[02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:18.140]
Gali Miss Molly. Here's Miami. Hello

[02:18:19.220 --> 02:18:26.040]
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? I'm doing good. I've got a question. I'm a little confused about the the North Korea

[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:33.740]
Problem. I know that the last thing I read was about it. I suppose I guess we cut off some type of fuel shipment which

[02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:37.740]
I just gave them a reason to try to start up this nuclear program

[02:18:37.740 --> 02:18:41.860]
I'm just trying to figure out why we stopped the that shipment in the first place

[02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:43.880]
We stopped the shipment of

[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:45.180]
Well, no, it was

[02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:48.080]
nerve gas

[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:52.340]
Wasn't it was it was a

[02:18:52.340 --> 02:18:57.480]
It was a scud that we stopped with the nerve gas. I have the story right here. So if you listen now, I'll read it

[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:03.520]
Cargo of several tons of chemical that can be used as a precursor to nerve gas was delivered in North Korea recently more the same ship

[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:07.940]
That was intercepted last December a hauling scud missiles to Yemen the Washington Times said yesterday

[02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:12.820]
Intelligence sources said the shipment of sodium cyanide arrived in North Korea in port of Nampo last week

[02:19:12.820 --> 02:19:20.380]
Aborder freighter So san which is the same ship that was stopped in the Indian Ocean by US and Spanish warships as it sailed for Yemen with 15 missiles and warheads

[02:19:21.060 --> 02:19:28.140]
The So san was allowed to continue its voyage with its cargo intact after US official determined that the Yemeni government legally purchased the scuds

[02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:38.400]
After unloading in Yemen the So san picked up the sodium cyanide in Germany and was tracked by US intelligence services as it sailed back to North Korea the time said and that great

[02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:42.960]
It was tracked back we didn't do anything about it. We just uh, you know watched it

[02:19:44.420 --> 02:19:49.440]
I just want to go back at you. There you go. Sodium cyanide. Maybe they're just using it for something else like you know

[02:19:50.140 --> 02:19:51.740]
treating meat something like that

[02:19:53.380 --> 02:19:56.740]
5670560 pound 560 on a AT&T line. Here's Davy. Hello

[02:19:58.900 --> 02:20:06.000]
Davy hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. Hi Neil. How you doing? Okay? Um Neil. I have the misfortune of having to drive i95

[02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:12.440]
About once or twice a month from here up to Washington DC and you're riding along

[02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:23.380]
Listed on the radio trying to find a station. It's impossible all the stations sound the same everything clear channel owns everything right or some other group owns it

[02:20:23.380 --> 02:20:30.760]
And if you turn it on in that we're land those stations sounds the same as the Jacksonville station sounds the same as the Charlotte station

[02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:34.960]
Right and it's sad. It's really sad. There is no diversity. There is no variety

[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:39.020]
It's all the same if I hear a stairway to heaven again. I'll blow my brains out. Yeah

[02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:40.260]
You know, it's all the same stuff

[02:20:40.260 --> 02:20:43.340]
So I don't know who these people are saying about there's more selection and stuff

[02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:47.340]
And I have to I have to laugh when they talk about the diversity it's created

[02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:49.860]
Let's take South Florida to Miami market as an example

[02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:54.740]
All the stuff that's been going on in the news the last few months and since 9 11

[02:20:54.740 --> 02:20:57.740]
If you really want to find out after nine o'clock in the morning

[02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:02.620]
If you want to find out any news about what's happening in the world you can forget about it because they're thanks to clear channel

[02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:05.560]
There is no more news station when they bought all those stations from Paxon

[02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:11.000]
W I N Z was all news and W I would be was at talk station. Yep, then they swapped that out

[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.240]
Then they tried to talk on I and Z and that flopped one over like a pregnant pole of order

[02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:19.620]
Then they made it into Fox sports because it was cheap and they opened up a pot and I'll let you just put that syndicated crap on there

[02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:24.520]
And they turn I would be into supposedly the news station, but guess what the news is on in the morning only

[02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:28.600]
And the rest of the day we have a bunch of syndicated crap. That's great. That's correct

[02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:31.640]
So if you're driving around like in the middle of September the top of an hour

[02:21:31.640 --> 02:21:36.460]
But in the middle of an hour and you really want to find an all-new station in South Florida, guess what? Don't have one good luck

[02:21:36.460 --> 02:21:42.660]
Yeah, thanks, Neil. You took your other show. Thanks. I'm in my see. I see there's a good guy. He's happy

[02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:45.200]
He likes the show. He's honest about radio with sucks

[02:21:45.940 --> 02:21:49.780]
And seriously if you want to find out what's going on I had the same experience. Well, I was there

[02:21:50.740 --> 02:21:59.180]
On days when they were like pressing and more important things than who want to go to the ball game or you know about the Tyson fight or some crap who won some goddamn golf tournament

[02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:05.000]
And you flip around the dial and there's nothing there is no such thing it doesn't exist in South Florida

[02:22:06.540 --> 02:22:14.500]
So they've taken two formally sensational radio stations WI and Z 50,000 once and WI would do what some of us know a little bit about and they've turned them into crap

[02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:15.860]
crap

[02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:18.240]
I

[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:22.440]
Say let's have 20 all sports stations at a market then Greg can have hemorrhoids all all year round

[02:22:22.900 --> 02:22:26.480]
Because the room around here is he's crappin' in his pants about 850 is going 50,000

[02:22:26.480 --> 02:22:28.700]
Who gives a crap if they go two million watts?

[02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:31.420]
They're in Palm Beach County. They have nothing to do with us

[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:37.000]
Always crappin his pantaloonies remember the fan first went on the year and he's fighting lawsuits

[02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:41.400]
He's having a nervous breakdown see the people that have a nervous breakdown and file lawsuits other people

[02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:45.940]
I have no idea what they're doing. That's what the problem is when you're insecure and you haven't got a clue

[02:22:47.780 --> 02:22:51.580]
And the fact of the matter is that after five years they still don't understand what this show is all about

[02:22:51.580 --> 02:22:55.300]
That's the best part of the deal. They haven't got a clue what this is all about or how to make it work

[02:22:56.240 --> 02:23:00.040]
But anyway have a nice day Greg sports and pain norm sports

[02:23:01.340 --> 02:23:06.800]
Four minutes till noon at 560 well at least we closed out the phone segment today with a guy that had something to say

[02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:08.820]
How do you like that? Huh? When I could wait long enough

[02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:12.880]
No seriously because it's psychologically that made that makes me almost want to come back again tomorrow

[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:18.560]
And then I think about the fact that next Tuesday's the 25th and there will be paychecks plural air for me on the 25th right clearance

[02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:19.820]
And so it'll be worth coming back

[02:23:20.980 --> 02:23:23.820]
And if not, I'll just call clearance up and he'll say sports

[02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:27.920]

We here at the Navy are being forced to come out and tell you the American people that we need semen

[02:25:45.540 --> 02:25:52.120]
We need a lot of good strong semen frankly. We're so low that we're looking for all kinds of semen

[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:58.080]
We get young semen old semen heck at this point. We'll take any semen that shoots our way

[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:03.020]
Without semen we're not the men we should be so please help us

[02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:10.280]
We need your semen America. Give us all you can as we say in the Navy all hands on deck

[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:15.940]

What I don't understand what the hell I don't roll unlike most people I got lots of birthdays during a county

You seem very new you seem pretending

[02:38:23.860 --> 02:38:26.820]
What he is hiding away

[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:35.440]
We're going in just to teach him a lesson that is that crime doesn't pay

They'd nothing like a hot bowl of soup.

[02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:23.520]
You know what, take me back to a time when my man had done it all whole neighborhood smell like canned tomatoes.

[02:39:24.060 --> 02:39:29.940]
Wearly ate like that no more, with all the new flavors from scamble soup, like gigaboo stew,

[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:35.120]

[02:39:45.140 --> 02:39:45.140]

[02:39:49.460 --> 02:39:59.900]
That's interpretation but reveals a lot of golds,

[02:40:00.220 --> 02:40:00.480]
especially with the white, coupled to the omega C,

[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:02.740]

a dollar from the past. What is it? You're having a controversial show on

[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:13.220]
colors from the past. No, we're not talking about colors from the past. You're

[02:40:13.220 --> 02:40:17.040]
a bitch. A bitch that you're doing? Sure, what are you talking about? You're

[02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:23.340]
plain old bitch. No, no, I'm not. We had a call a while back and I guess you

[02:40:23.340 --> 02:40:27.840]
did a tape and you made some type of a cart on it. I guess that's what they're

[02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:31.840]
telling me. And we discussed not playing it on the air. What are you talking

[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:35.420]
about? The part that gave it, sir. That was one of my

[02:40:35.420 --> 02:40:39.720]
two days. Yes, sir. Yeah. Appreciate to not play that. I thought you

[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:43.920]

[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:48.500]
receive the letters, sir? Your gay. Your gay. Sir, your gay. Did you

[02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:54.980]
receive the letters? Your gay. They'll be a lawsuit. Your gay. Sir. Your gay. No,

[02:40:55.160 --> 02:41:00.800]

[02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:14.640]
records. I was the most top on top of the world until I'm out of the

[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:20.260]
gook and got shot in the head. Hi. I'm Mama Cass. Avoid the ham sandwich. I'm

shot. The fuck up. How you doing, Kurt? I'm Buddy Holly. Have you seen my glasses?

[02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:38.220]

[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:52.440]
Stupid. What's that? Oh, man. That's just the armor that drummer fell

[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:57.700]
from deathly at heart or something like that. 1225 at 560. Nobody can you

[02:41:57.700 --> 02:42:03.980]
want to step on it last piece? No. We have 507 votes on the poll 514, like I

[02:42:03.980 --> 02:42:07.560]
said, who would be the happiest of Neil Croke? Moly Howard, David, and would dance

[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:12.940]
on Neil's grave, 290. George thinks he'd get the show 87. Dennis, the chronic

Reverend Dr. James Kennedy, 22. Got a late start, but he's catching up.

[02:42:24.340 --> 02:42:28.180]
Fox News Heather, 21. Geldie, just out of spite nine. Eric, no more of those long

[02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:32.480]

[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:37.380]
coming up on March 1st, by the way, which isn't that far away? What? Shame on you.

[02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:47.940]
Shame on you. And March 1st? March 1st. It's a week from tomorrow, isn't it? Right. Am I right?

[02:42:47.940 --> 02:42:51.300]
Uh, is it a week from Friday? Saturday.

[02:42:52.060 --> 02:42:55.700]
A week from Saturday is March 1st? Well, that's right. It's only the 19th. Saturday,

[02:42:55.780 --> 02:42:59.580]
so that means I guess on Friday, we'll have to do my 27th anniversary show. Oh,

[02:42:59.620 --> 02:43:03.240]
that's right. It's on my calendar, but the wrong page. Yeah. And guess who can

[02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:09.480]

[02:43:15.860 --> 02:43:19.080]
the bad news, but the good news is they got just about everything else. They're in

[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:23.280]

mouthwatering on trace. Everything fresh and crunchy. Nothing soggy and mushy that sits

[02:43:31.180 --> 02:43:34.480]
