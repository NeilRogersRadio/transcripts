[00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.080]
Again a dark ass.

[00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.340]
Olympic icecapes man

[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.760]
It's such a dirty trait

[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.060]
Tonya tries to win.

[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.980]
Welcome.

[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.200]
She was second best in it.

[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:13.860]
Uh uh.

[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.500]
So.

[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.080]
Uh uh uh.

[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.960]
Nancy Kerrigan the bitch

[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.280]
was going to win again.

[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.460]
Tonya blocks revenge.

[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.460]
Highest out a henchman.

[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.780]
Uh uh uh uh.

[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.660]
And as Nancy Kerrigan was leaving

[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.360]
ring, she snucked up from behind.

[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.660]
Bang bang ton you still the hammer

[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.480]
came down upon her knee.

[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.020]
Bang bang ton you still the hammer

[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.380]
made sure a victory.

[00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.940]
Uh uh uh uh uh.

[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.220]
Olympic middle round

[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.040]
Tonya is a lovely girl

[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.380]
over every move.

[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.920]
She can't find a new

[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.420]
rock ball or a peanut.

[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.840]
She foregoes the plan

[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.180]
makes a way and do the stand murder

[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.960]
on her mind.

[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.620]
She has never minded a challenge

[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.700]
out out out out.

[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.720]
The crowd they make a break

[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.560]
for the door but it's too late

[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.620]
to run.

[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.080]
Bang bang ton you still the hammer

[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.440]
just smashing in their heads.

[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.620]
She would not leave

[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.140]
till I'm a till every one

[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.820]
wants to.

[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.520]
One T-48

[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.200]
Tonars at the pearly

[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.120]
gate, St.P. checks his

[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.740]
book.

[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.080]
He gives her a look and he tells

[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.300]
her now.

[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.820]
Uh uh uh.

[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.880]
She claims she's in a

[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.720]
sunglasses up and throws a

[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.260]
fifty turnity on the line.

[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.400]
This guy's out of line and he's

[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.900]
got to go.

[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.120]
As St.P. was turning the page

[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.080]
Tonars took her eyes.

[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.440]
Bang bang ton you still the hammer

[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.060]
ring, St.P.

[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.160]
He just fell.

[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.740]
St.P.

[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.060]
You know St.P.

[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.420]
And then she went straight

[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.260]
to hell.

[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.740]
24 to 12 5 60 WQM and I think

[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.440]
that uh you owe Bruce Springsteen

[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.200]
an apology Mr.

[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.200]
He sucks.

[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.260]
I think that your position on

[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.360]
Bruce Springsteen is very

[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.660]
aware.

[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.000]
He's suck but I talk about

[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.080]
the

[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.460]
thing.

[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.680]
I think that's what he's

[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.680]

[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.660]
I think that's what he's

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.660]

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.660]

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.660]

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.660]

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.660]

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.660]

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.660]

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.660]

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.660]

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.660]

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.660]

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.660]

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.660]

[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.080]
I think that's what he's

[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.080]

[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.320]
I think that's what he's

[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.320]

[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.720]
I think that's what he's

[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.720]

[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.660]
I think that's what he's

[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.660]

[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.960]
I think that's what he's

[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.600]
doing.

[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.240]
He's doing something or you

[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.720]
know find yourself a new

[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.340]
instrument.

[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.500]
He's out doing something.

[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.940]
Either that or she heard

[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.760]
your voice in the beginning.

[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.060]
Right.

[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.140]
But seriously nobody knows

[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.240]
they tune in and nine if the

[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.880]
thing is screwed up.

[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.880]
That's it.

[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.720]
So I guess our engineering

[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.800]
department isn't concerned

[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.620]
enough that we're destroying

[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.040]
a lot of people and probably

[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.820]
our engineering department

[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.060]
doesn't believe that we have

[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.900]
anybody outside the

[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.220]
media market who really wants

[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.760]
to hear them.

[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.440]
You're Roger Show.

[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.160]
They don't show up in the

[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.480]
ratings.

[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.980]
We don't sell ads to them.

[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.920]
No, no, it's not that.

[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.740]
They just don't feel that

[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.680]
anybody who would want to hear

[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.180]
this anyway.

[00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.460]
I see.

[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.760]
I understand.

[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.920]
Music one.

[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.580]
One.

[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.620]
And I think like I said

[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.420]
before people are interested

[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.820]
in music.

[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.140]
They're listening to what

[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.900]
was plus.

[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.680]
Plus if I'm talking about

[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.340]
music it's usually my music

[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.740]
and being the old fart that I

[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.800]
am admittedly so.

[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.320]
I'm not going to be talking

[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.120]
about what they're interested

[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.460]
in.

[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.880]
That's for damn sure, especially

[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.740]
looking at these grand.

[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.400]
You're not going to be talking

[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.840]
about nori-

[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.180]
I do like the food fighters.

[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.740]
That's one.

[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.860]
Right.

[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.540]
Corn.

[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.560]
I mean, best rap album

[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.340]

[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.160]
Oh my God.

[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.420]
Corn sure is special.

[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.380]
Your favorite got to

[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.520]

[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.040]
album.

Category 13.

[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.860]

[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.140]

[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.340]
Cornhole.

[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.460]

Like I said, the whole thing

[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.660]
is a cluster four.

[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.820]
Okay, that's all it is.

[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.080]
The bunch of crap.

[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.580]
Best everything.

[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.520]
Song of the Year.

[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.040]

[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.820]
No.

[00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.380]
Neither.

[00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.140]
Carlis多.

[00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.140]

[00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.140]

[00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.140]

[00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.140]

[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.320]
I mean, where would we hear

[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.600]
it?

[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.120]
Maybe gloves 94.

[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.020]
Oh my God.

[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.900]
Well, she's jazz.

[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.780]
I mean, who would help

[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.880]
her?

[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.480]
She's jazz.

[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.720]
Yeah, please warn me so I can

[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.240]
avoid them.

[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.180]

[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.420]
There's a good Canadian girl.

[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.760]
Look, Brian likes her.

[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.900]

[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.640]
Vocabrine.

[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.380]
Like the Diana Crawl.

[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.620]
Yeah.

[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.380]
Maybe he likes to see Diana Crawl.

[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.120]
Yeah.

[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.120]

He think I don't know.

[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.520]
He think I don't know.

[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.840]
That's right.

[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.000]
He think I don't know.

[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.400]
What kind of a name is that?

[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.840]
Like a dog.

[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.000]
Oh, he think I don't be

[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.260]

[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.880]
What is that?

[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.400]
Best male R&B performance you

[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.440]
don't have to call by usher.

[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.620]
Okay.

[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.220]
That's interesting.

[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.680]
Some of this other stuff on here.

[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.100]
People haven't been born yet.

[00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.040]
Contemporary R&B album,

[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.540]
A Shanti by A Shanti.

[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.440]
What makes sense to me?

[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.180]
Faith Hill.

[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.800]
Oh, who knows?

[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.640]
Rip and Faith Hill.

[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.400]
Oh, the news guy.

[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.100]
I miss his news guy.

[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.800]
What else is his name?

[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.640]
I don't know what his name is.

[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.600]
I've never known what his name is.

[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.080]
He ripped her in ass.

[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.140]
He said she doesn't sing.

[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.400]
Well, I guess what he's trying to say is she's a female

[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.120]
Bruce Springsteen.

[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.020]
She never sings one note.

[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.980]
All she does is scream.

[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.400]
And kind of like Maria,

[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.500]
like what's her name?

[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.720]
Mariah Carey.

[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.840]
She canter walls.

[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.480]
Wheels.

[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.620]
She just canter walls.

[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.240]
Mariah.

[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.940]
And thank God Mariah Carey didn't gain it.

[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.420]
Did she know?

[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.340]
We'll see you around here so far.

[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.320]
Thank God.

[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.220]
Female rock performance vocal Steve McQueen by Cheryl Crow.

[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.620]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.200]
Makes me want to crow up.

[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.720]
And all that.

[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.140]
And that's it.

[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.640]
So they don't want to hear about music.

[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.180]
Getting back.

[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:43.860]
Yes.

[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.540]
See how I interrupt myself when I get sidetracked?

[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.620]
I could kill some time.

[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.260]
I know.

[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.460]
I know that you're playing a lot of long stuff.

[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.480]
Thank you.

[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.740]

[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.320]

[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.560]
Call?

[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.040]
None.

[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.680]
Food 9.

[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.480]
Right.

[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.140]
And that was a late addition.

[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.060]
TV and movies 10,

Hockey 18, you're right.

[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.160]
That's being freaked.

[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.980]
I'm going to start calling remember the Freeper.

[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.660]

Hey, I went to the store this morning in the middle of the show.

[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.800]
Yeah, what you got?

[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.820]
Took a shower.

[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.500]
I got to mommy of the Toronto star and Toronto sun.

[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.220]
What kind of soap?

[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.260]
What kind of soap?

[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:34.800]
You zest.

[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.320]
Ah.

[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.500]
Zest the unsop.

[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.720]
I didn't drop it either.

[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.300]
Eels personal adventures 40,

Politics 51 and internal WQM Shenanigans 84.

[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.380]
Hands down your pants, baby.

[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.120]
They want the inside story.

[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.620]
And believe me in our place,

[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.480]
there's a zillion inside stories.

[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.960]
And almost any name you pick out of the hat you can say.

[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.680]
He's an asshole.

[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.020]
And nobody will argue with you.

[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.560]
Like Moe, for example,

[00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.440]
we haven't even got started.

[00:07:59.560 --> 00:07:59.920]
No, no.

[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.580]
He's a crap.

[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.360]
He's a turd.

[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.780]
Silky old coupe.

[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.760]
By the way, Pat News for him,

[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.460]
I'm still alive.

[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.180]
It'll scratch you throughout a little bit of a head cold.

[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.280]
Although it's mostly gone.

[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.300]
I think it's like, you know,

[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.340]
you didn't promote the show this morning.

[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.540]
What is it?

[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.300]
He was made aware that you were sick and

[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.460]
and that I was going to be filling in and he didn't give

[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.080]
it a problem.

[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.140]
He didn't give a crap as what you're trying to say.

[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:23.940]
That's what I'm trying to say.

[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.200]
He didn't give a hoot.

[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.480]
He was made aware.

[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.540]
There's only one thing he needs to be made

[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.580]
and that is to disappear.

[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.400]
Maybe the genie,

[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.340]
the one who did the circumcision,

[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.360]
let's get her number.

[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:33.860]
What do you say?

[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.680]
How do you know it was a girl, genie?

[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.660]
Don't take it personal, Moe, but

[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:38.720]
bye, bye, bye!

[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:40.800]
Take it with a mean genie.

[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.180]
Is it the time for a break or are you getting lost?

[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.820]
No, I'm just going to have a knife in a cup.

[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.100]
I'm just having a good time.

[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.320]
Having a very good time,

[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:46.920]
as a matter of fact.

[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.320]
Me too.

[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.840]
I was having a nervous breakdown.

[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.720]
So I'm amazed.

[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.840]
18-12 on 5-60, WQAM.

[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.180]
Hey, let me tell you about our good friend Tom Laman

[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:54.800]
and Joe Prieta.

[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.460]
They're very big.

[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.640]
They got cars up to their eyelids.

[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.220]
The fact we send Halop Pontiac.

[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.000]
So damn many vehicles that they've got no place to stick them.

[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.120]
Even Tom Laman's headed park cars and SUVs and trucks.

[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.600]
All kinds of crap in his driveway.

[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.160]
So they'd like to place one in yours.

[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.840]

And the credit deal,

[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.620]
I keep telling you this over and over again.

[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.340]
Maybe you don't believe me.

[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.380]
If you're afraid to go to a car dealer

[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.140]
because of the fact that your credit is so bad,

[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.580]
these are the people you want to see.

[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.980]
They won't laugh you off the lot.

[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.600]
They might laugh behind your back a little.

[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.940]
But it's the winner-blizzard emergency sale going on right now.

[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.360]

That's incredible.

[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.660]
That was incredible.

[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.180]
I don't remember if we planned this.

[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.280]
Copy, good news.

[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.980]
There was watching TV with my buddies TV,

[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.160]
and we saw the strangest things.

[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.040]
Sure, long ago.

[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.600]
We saw come paddling your woman

[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.460]
and we saw a link in Axie as the headwinds.

[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.260]
I turned a candle free and what did I see?

[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.880]
But a lady looked real rich.

[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.260]
Living on the hill,

[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.800]
pitching back to silver,

[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.340]
the special bell and an engine.

[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.800]
I tried once more in the

[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.500]
channel four and I was shot the most

[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.100]
the best.

[00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.700]
A girl who was drunk,

[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.240]
she said that when she's smelling funky,

[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.440]
she just courts it with FDS.

[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.980]
Well, it's on every station

[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.800]
and oversight,

[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.480]
the rage in a feminine high-sena.

[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.400]
New season or events and over here,

[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.280]
boys and don't forget those magic answers.

[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.740]
But they have wings.

[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.440]
Let's all cry.

[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.440]
Come on, give it a try.

[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.400]
It's right when it's hygiene.

[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.900]
Mother and a daughter walk

[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.940]
in mother water,

[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.160]
so many don't smell fresh.

[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.780]
On a sad seven,

[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.280]
put her back in heaven,

[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.620]
cause she's really makes some mess.

[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.460]
Middle age,

[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.620]
baby 10 looking for a lubricant.

[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.580]
I still can hear your voice.

[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.260]
From mama done told her

[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.720]
when a woman gets older,

[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.420]
the muffin downstairs

[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.100]
don't smell moist.

[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.400]
Causes on every station

[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.780]
with no good observation,

[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.720]
the feminine high-sena.

[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.400]
Greens and low-sens and all her emotions

[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.680]
and all the water she retains.

[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.800]
It's so insane in this game.

[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.120]
There's plenty of names for feminine hygiene.

[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.340]
Why do we have to view

[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.540]
all that stuff goes through?

[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.540]
It's really got must of it really.

[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.900]
Let's give those as we see.

[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.960]
A historic dummy or at least

[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.220]
make a more damn appealing.

[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.420]
Causes on every station

[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.660]
and all the saturation

[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.740]
of feminine high-sena.

[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.620]
Fusions and audience

[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.700]
and all the tea-appointing screens

[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.340]
and low-sens and all the revolutions.

[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.040]
Some are either massagil

[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.360]
or when you're too fragile.

[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.800]
Coaches, stamps,

[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.680]
panic, or leastexit,

[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.000]
nor one pamphlets.

[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:06.940]
Feminites,

[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:07.520]
can be fun,

[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:08.460]
savoury,

[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:09.200]
carefree,

[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.300]
all of them are the same.

[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:10.620]
Manny,

[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.400]
monosat,

[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.060]
famstand,

[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:12.960]
a plug for this,

[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.740]
a pad for that,

[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.340]
holds and might all

[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.680]
in case you throw a title.

[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.320]
Many mind-retangles

[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.820]
and lists that have been on and on.

[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.600]
How do I end this song?

[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.160]
It's so insane.

[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:23.160]

[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:23.160]

[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.640]
I'm so b chattering.

[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.400]
But it's alright,

[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.560]
I'm fricking CV.

[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.560]
Feminite high-sena.

[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.940]
Oh oh oh.

[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:31.740]
Well,

[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.640]
it's all my damn CV.

[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.800]
It's feminine high-sena.

[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.200]
I'm just infectious!

[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.980]
You ever play that?

[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:39.700]
No.

[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.860]
I'm pretty sure I know why.

[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.420]
Yeah. Well,

[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.420]
who sucks three and a half minutes back.

[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.240]
I'm loving this song.

[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.120]
Pretty weak.

[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.320]
So anyway,

[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.520]
I must have hit the jackpot

[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.740]
because I had all these different…

[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.540]
I mean a huge

[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.260]
do you have a thing of volume?

[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:52.980]
Yeah.

[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.760]
There's samples of all the products they make.

[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.020]
And so I picked out of those, the immune system olive oil,

[00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.480]
assuming that it would have something to do with,

[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.220]
you know, being under the weather, right?

[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.560]
And I'm reading the ingredients now that I already popped to,

[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.060]
but just to be curious, and it says it does

[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.420]
that the first sign of a cold, take two soft gels,

[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.320]
two times a day with water at meal times

[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.560]
is the dietary supplement for maximum of four weeks.

[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.100]
How do you like that?

[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:15.620]
Okay.

[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.860]
So it's cold stuff.

[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.760]
So thanks again.

[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.580]
I thought you were gonna surprise us with something

[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.120]
like you were reading the ingredients

[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.320]
and it had sorbitol in it or something.

[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:24.600]
No.

[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.280]
Just be glad I didn't get my,

[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.240]
but equal with sugar free.

[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:31.380]
Yeah.

[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:32.520]
Because you wouldn't be having

[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.640]
really as much company here.

[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.560]
I'll be doing the show run.

[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.060]
I'll just, don't you have a wireless mic up there?

[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.500]
You could take it into the toilet with you.

[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.040]
Yeah, that would be good.

[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.800]
Yeah, we have a wireless mic here.

[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:40.280]
Right.

[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.160]
Hey, it's been done.

[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.760]
Don't even have sound capability through the board here.

[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:44.960]
We don't even have any audio.

[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.680]
Do you realize how easy it would be?

[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.040]
Yeah, I did.

[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.020]
If we had audio effect.

[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.180]
And I could put a whole bunch of news

[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.200]
up into the DCS.

[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:52.440]

[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.320]
And Vokobron could email me stuff

[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.100]
instead of like these discs back and forth.

[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.280]
You don't know.

[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.300]
Are you starting up again?

[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.100]
No, because I'll take part of the blame for those.

[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:02.620]
I never asked.

[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.840]
This man like royalty, we give him anything we want.

[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.120]
We built them studios on the moon when he asked for them.

[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.740]
And this is all he does is sit and bend.

[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:09.300]

[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.160]
Fast to.

[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.860]
Now, what's your thing we should take a call?

[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.840]
Well, I was thinking about what you said,

[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:14.740]
but then they went away.

[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.340]
You even had a call from Toronto on there.

[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.780]
Now, and they went away.

[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.540]
They did?

[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.860]
Well, it was from Miami, but he was visiting down here

[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.600]
and he was wondering what you were doing down here.

[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.200]
He was wondering what?

[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.180]
Why you were up there and doing the show down here

[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.740]
and he was a Torontoite.

[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:30.660]
Yeah.

[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.720]
So he might be back.

[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:34.900]
He hung up.

[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.660]
He might be back.

[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.060]
What do we do?

[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:37.500]
I got it.

[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.620]
Well, the phones ringing.

[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.820]
So all we're waiting for Carlos to screen that.

[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.720]
You know, we have been business for Wednesday.

[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.060]
Did you see the schedule?

[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.280]
Oh, you know what?

[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.960]
I didn't fax the new updated schedule to you.

[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.360]
Well, no, this one just has question marks

[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.320]
between three and seven.

[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:52.820]
Right.

[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.660]
The question was,

[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:54.620]
Hank goes into the,

[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.460]
and I don't know where that is.

[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.640]
Hank at the Roy Jones fight.

[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.400]
How about that Mike Tyson fight for 49 seconds?

[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.500]
How about that Tonya Harding fight?

[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:01.880]
Yeah, I saw that.

[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.760]
I mean, I didn't see it,

[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.440]
but I saw the pictures.

[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:04.060]
Yeah.

[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.300]
What is beast?

[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:06.940]
Got beaten bad.

[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.140]
Good, trounced nasty smelly bitch.

[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.680]
So what is on Wednesday that I don't see on here?

[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.860]
Well, I'm faxing it to you right now,

[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.700]
but I'll just break it here.

[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:20.240]
It's Joe and Mark in the daytime.

[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.060]
How about that?

[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.120]
Joe, who was so nice to visit us

[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.640]
during the atreasural and appearance on Friday,

[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.780]
with Janina, by the way.

[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.920]
Is Hank contemplating,

[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.140]
is Hank contemplating retirement or something?

[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.860]
Well, I'm not joking you.

[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:40.620]
I'm serious.

[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.860]
Hank is, oh my, oh my.

[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.320]
I'm speaking of Joseph Gackie.

[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.460]
What would you rather have on?

[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.060]
Joseph Gackie.

[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.100]
Really?

[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:51.720]
Yeah.

[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.080]
In light of recent development,

[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.520]
they run a kiddie show, Joe and Mark.

[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.700]
They have like for little kids.

[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.960]
They run a parallel juvenile kiddie show,

[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.220]
which is fine between two and six in the morning

[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.100]
as a lead into a guy that's got a lot of kids anyway,

[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.920]
but I mean, right there in the middle of the daytime,

[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.000]
that's the last of the school.

[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.840]
It's super nice to be heard up and down 441.

[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.360]
Right, when the kids get out of school,

[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.500]
they can listen to Joe and Mark.

[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.480]
So the lens of like right before 3 o'clock, I think.

[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.180]
Oh my, oh my.

[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.980]
Oh no, this is Miami, but it's not the guy from Toronto.

[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:24.460]
Hello.

[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:25.380]
It's a good bug.

[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.820]
Yeah, good one.

[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:27.940]
See, there you go.

[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.020]
There's our second call today.

[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.000]
And he said it's so boringly too, you know?

[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.000]
You know what was coming from down there,

[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.060]
because he was so boring.

[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.000]
Here's Margate.

[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.280]
Hello.

[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:37.880]
Hi Neil.

[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:38.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.300]
How are you?

[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:39.960]
Okay.

[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:40.760]
I'm coming along.

[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.620]
Can you put Mr. G on that list?

[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.220]
No.

[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.340]
Oh, nice job there Carlos.

[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.500]
You're doing it, baby.

[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.480]
Oh, you know, he's impossible to scream.

[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.280]
Is he really?

[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.780]
Well, no, not for somebody who's here.

[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.540]
Not for a federal, not a speaker like George.

[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.020]
Right.

[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.480]
He calls him.

[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.100]
There's all of our reason not to be taking calls

[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.240]
because we got about 10 people who just, you know,

[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:03.700]
and that's it.

[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.640]
Joe's a good guy.

[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:05.940]
We should give his number out.

[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.300]
Who's that, Mr.

[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:08.380]
Mr. Gettart?

[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.220]
Mr. Who called?

[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.920]
Who'd you rather have from President Richard Gettart?

[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:13.640]
What's his name?

[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.000]
Joseph.

[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.480]
Go ahead.

[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.400]
195.

[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.460]
He's obviously lonely, Mr. G.

[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.340]
954.

[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:21.740]
974.

[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.000]
974.

[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.020]
6235.

[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.120]
6235.

[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.120]
Maybe he likes to talk to you.

[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:26.860]
Well, you were out here.

[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.360]
Well, you were out here.

[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.760]
I guess it was last week.

[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.100]
Remember the, I'm crazy guy.

[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.140]
Yeah, called.

[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.780]
We gave his number out.

[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.800]
Haven't heard from him since.

[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.140]
Oh, he'll be back.

[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:35.760]
I'm sure.

[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.120]
So that guy, and I look at this.

[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.940]
We're begging for calls here because we want to take

[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.240]
like a real call before noon.

[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.140]
I don't think we're going to get a real call.

[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.040]
Let me Q.A.M.

[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.720]
Nobody on five.

[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.000]
Ranked a couple of times.

[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:47.660]
That was the end of that.

[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.040]
Yeah, they want the calls.

[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.340]
I guess we, and so what do you mean they want the calls?

[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.700]
All the polls you took, remember?

[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.920]
There aren't any calls.

[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.620]
All the stuff that we talked about here for three hours today.

[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.560]
And there's not a single call.

[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.060]
Nobody has anything to say about the Grammys,

[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.440]
about your Mami, about anything.

[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.040]
The, the beach.

[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:05.960]

[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.180]
Yeah, the city's on the beach.

[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.580]
The illegal alien, well, would they're a grave robbing

[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.540]
or are they going to want to donate into kids organs?

[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.700]
Not how do you like that?

[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.340]
Now what was the other?

[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.380]
There was one other big guy.

[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.480]
And then the fire, we tell the truth, 97.

[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.820]
97 dead people.

[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.280]
And nobody want to, nobody wants to fish up.

[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.940]
Now you didn't see the thing with the band that played there

[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.680]
before that said that they had, had power stations.

[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.160]
They showed up.

[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.380]
They should, two other acts as a matter of fact.

[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.700]
Another band, and a kiss mock band that also used way

[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.620]
more power techniques than we saw in the, you know,

[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.940]
the game building with no sprinkler system.

[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.260]
We end with the like foam rubber insulation.

[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.400]
I mean, like the station.

[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:45.860]
Right.

[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:46.860]
Oh, sorry.

[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:47.940]
Here's for Lauderdale.

[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:48.200]
Hello.

[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.700]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.240]
OK.

[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.900]
I just, this is a real call.

[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.640]
I, I wondered if the other night you saw a front line

[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.840]
or anybody mentioned about it.

[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.640]
We're going to call about it on Friday,

[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.600]
but I forgot it was on.

[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.140]
I didn't see it.

[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.700]
We had one call.

[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.280]
It was, it was so good.

[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.440]
Showed how the Bush campaign, even before he was president,

[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.480]
was already focusing on Saddam and sweeping up

[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.040]
that what his dad had not completed.

[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.380]
Yeah, they have unfinished business.

[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:15.920]
That's correct.

[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:17.340]
All right.

[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:17.880]
That's all I got.

[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.020]
OK, thanks.

[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:20.420]
Yes.

[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.560]
See, nobody watches PBS.

[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.700]
That's the problem because once every six months,

[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.220]
they put something under its worth seeing.

[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.120]
Yeah, that's all.

[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.580]
And when you're not in the habit of turning onto it,

[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.000]
it's just, you forget about it.

[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.180]
Somebody had called a warner said that it was going to be on,

[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.500]
but I forgot all about it.

[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.920]
But that's two calls we are.

[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:35.560]
Let's hear it.

[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.420]
Two calls.

[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.720]
Hey, the Toronto guys back.

[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.380]
Where the hell is he?

[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.000]
Three on three.

[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.100]
How's it going, eh?

[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.280]
Hi.

[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.240]
How you doing?

[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.140]
Fine, you.

[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.000]
Great.

[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.700]
I'm here visiting.

[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.580]
I've been here almost two weeks now.

[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.000]
And I stumbled into your radio station

[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.900]
and I've been listening to it ever since.

[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.000]
Thank goodness for that.

[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.640]
And that ironic that you're a Tarantonian who's in Miami.

[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.740]
And I'm a Miami guy who's in Toronto.

[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.360]
How do you like that?

[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.280]
Now, I just can't figure out in the two weeks I've been listening.

[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.520]
I still can't figure out why you're in Toronto.

[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.040]
Because I don't like it there.

[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.680]
Because I'm a big, I'm a Toronto person.

[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:11.540]
Oh, I see.

[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.080]
Didn't know that.

[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.660]
A big lease ban, although last night we'll forget that it happened.

[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.360]
But other than that.

[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:16.780]
Great.

[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.560]
But anyway, you've only been there for a couple of weeks.

[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.520]
Now, have you been there a couple of months?

[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.820]
You understand why most of us hate it like poison and want to get out?

[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.240]
So since they built me a studio, I've here in my beautiful apartment.

[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.940]
Why the hell should I be down there more than I have to?

[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:28.540]
I see.

[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:29.280]
Good move.

[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.340]
By exactly.

[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.840]
But I like the weather here now.

[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.780]
Yeah, it's real toasty here.

[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.960]
It's minus 13 Celsius.

[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.240]
You made a good choice this week.

[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:36.700]
Yeah.

[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:44.820]
But also, the reason I stuck with your station, I think you're the only station in all of America.

[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:49.000]
I think that that's probably anti-war, you know?

[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:49.640]
Right.

[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.680]
And it's a refreshing thing.

[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.360]
That's because we're the only station in all of America that's got any balls.

[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.120]
Yeah.

[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.780]
That doesn't go step in line with these fascists who are running this country.

[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.560]
That's another reason I'm glad to be up here, eh?

[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.200]
That's right.

[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:02.480]
That's right.

[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.620]
We're not with you.

[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.400]
Not yet, anyway.

[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.280]
And congratulations.

[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.420]
See, you thought that that frog would be with a sliding mouth.

[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.000]
You thought he was a bad guy, but he's not all as stupid as we think he was.

[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:13.440]
That's right.

[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.400]
Okay, good to hear from you, pal.

[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:15.980]
Thanks.

[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:16.860]
See you, Brownie.

[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:17.240]
Yeah.

[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:17.800]
Golly's go.

[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.220]
How do you like that call from Toronto?

[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:21.100]

[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:21.380]
Huh?

[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.960]
One till 12 at 5.60 Q.A.

[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:24.420]
And a connection.

[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.200]
Everybody's got a different lifestyle.

[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.200]
We all need different things to help us be healthy.

[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.860]
That's why you ought to check out Oliomad Mediterranean formulas because they got advanced

All that you're thinking.

One thing.

[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:41.620]
One thing.

[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.620]

This is 560.

[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.520]
The radio's on your side.

[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.540]
Thank you, Ian.

[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.380]
No, how are they, David?

[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.080]
The only thing funny and then rape.

[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.360]
Is that bike smoke has 12-1 hour.

[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:37.640]
Oh yeah.

[00:24:54.020 --> 00:25:07.500]
Oh yeah.

[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:24.560]
Oh yeah.

[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.120]
Oh yeah.

[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.000]
Oh yeah.

[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:49.400]
Oh yeah.

[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:49.740]

[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:49.780]
Oh yeah.

[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.240]
Oh yeah.

[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.280]
Oh yeah.

[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.500]
Oh yeah.

[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.320]
Oh yeah.

[00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:58.960]
Oh yeah.

[00:25:59.160 --> 00:25:59.800]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:00.580]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.900]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:02.940]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:04.320]

[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:04.480]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:05.460]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:05.920]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:06.360]

[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:07.420]

[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:07.420]

[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:07.420]

[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:08.480]

[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:08.480]

[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:09.480]

[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:09.480]

[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:09.480]

[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:10.860]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:11.480]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:13.900]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:13.900]

[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.680]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.960]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.220]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:19.880]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.340]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:22.780]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:22.780]

[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:22.780]

[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:23.440]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:23.480]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:23.580]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:24.600]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.340]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:30.180]
12-5-5-60-QAM, Hank Goldberg at 3 o'clock, Jim Manichet 1.

[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.180]
I'm going a little bit backwards.

[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.720]
Sitco's Panthers preview at 7-7-30.

[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.300]
It's the Panthers and the Sabers.

[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:35.880]
Eddie K.

[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.860]
At the Game, Joe and Mark and their juvenile laughter school show from 2 to 6 in the morning.

[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.960]
Two pieces of good news.

[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:42.280]
Yeah.

[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.200]
Number one, it's all the way up to minus 12 Celsius.

[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:46.920]
That's, uh...

[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.400]
Yeah.

[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:47.800]
Yeah.

[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.700]
That's all over 10 degrees Fahrenheit.

[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.100]
Oh!

[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.240]
Time to open those windows.

[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:52.660]
And number two.

[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.100]
Yeah.

[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.520]
So Lynn Samiel's got my email and she's, uh, she's listening.

[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:56.980]
I'm sure.

[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.280]
Hot dog hopped on board.

[00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.680]
And says, get better, please.

[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.160]
I'm going to be in Miami next week or this week and can listen on the radio actually.

[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.420]
Plus, I don't want you to be sick.

[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:05.260]
Thanks Lynn.

[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.440]
You know, the back-and-set stop and then see George.

[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.640]
And we can schmooze that I heard again.

[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.580]
We could do another lunch at the diner and I'll buy this time.

[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:11.780]
Yeah.

[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.320]
Or he's going to buy it with Rimmer's money that Rimmer wasn't for that lunch.

[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.460]
Ask me if I ever got the $14 from that lottery ticket that we spent...

[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:20.920]
Oh, Mike!

[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.080]
Oh, Mike!

[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:22.540]
Right.

[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:23.820]
You can swing it.

[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.340]
Yeah, swing that's what he said.

[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.240]
So that'll be nice.

[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.660]
I got a guest line up for you there.

[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:29.520]
Thank you.

[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.460]
As opposed to taking these great phone calls.

[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.860]
Although we do have a lady in Miami, we better put her on immediately.

[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:36.280]
Hello.

[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.660]
Hello, Neil.

[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.600]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:43.880]
I'm sorry I couldn't be the only real caller before 12 o'clock, but I am a real caller now.

[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.760]
I wanted to talk to you about something that I read in the paper this morning.

[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.920]
I immediately thought of you.

[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:50.800]
From the Herald.

[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:51.700]
Oh.

[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.720]
It's by a woman named Michelle Malkin.

[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.320]
Malkin-tent.

[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.360]
Sodom and Gamora University.

[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:04.060]
And the little bylines of gay stick seekers use a university sponsored website

[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.400]
to locate partners for tourists.

[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.120]
It's about something out in California.

[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:18.000]
There's an anonymous university sponsored website at Berkeley that people use to locate partners

[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.160]
for tourists in Berkeley bathrooms and reports that as many as 18 glory holes which are used

[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.900]
for much worse than peering.

[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:26.520]

[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.500]
Peer-er-er-ing have been drilled across campus.

[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:31.840]
How do you like that?

[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.560]
This is a public safety hazard.

[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.500]
Public safety hazard.

[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:37.600]
Public safety hazard.

[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.280]
You're miss reading it and say, Pubek safety hazard.

[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.880]
You're looking for glory holes.

[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:47.600]
A Pubek health hazard is a public safety threat to other students unknowingly using these

[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.720]
marked bathrooms for what they were intended.

[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.660]
And of course the homosexuals see the bathroom back in alias as a sacred celebration of

[00:28:54.660 --> 00:29:00.820]
free speech and diversity, but my favorite is her last paragraph is, a devious practice

[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:06.820]
common at filthy truck stops has infected the hallowed ivory tower and all the campus

[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.960]
left can do is blame the messenger and play the victim card.

[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:16.900]
And then she goes on to quote, I swear to God, Genesis 1928 and load the smoke of the

[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:21.180]
country went up as the smoke of a furnace and came into the house.

[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.040]
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:23.400]
Wow.

[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.800]
This is cool.

[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.240]
This is amazing.

[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.140]
And this is the creator's syndicate 2003 creator's syndicate.

[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:32.680]
I don't know what.

[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.300]
Okay. Have a nice day.

[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.040]
And I hope you feel better.

[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:36.700]
Thanks.

[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.220]
Bye bye.

[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.240]
Boy boy.

[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:39.900]
I do like that.

[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.880]
Glory holes at Berkeley because there are a bunch of gay people there.

[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.620]
Shame on them.

[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.560]
Never were to thunk it.

[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.800]
I think it's part of their broad education, don't you?

[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.660]
What's the issue with broads?

[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.560]
Where else are you going to learn what a glory hole is?

[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.560]
Except it was lying in high alia.

[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.840]
You see the penny in there.

[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.920]
Is it JC Penney's or brood?

[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.900]
I think it's JC Penney's.

[00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:58.560]
I thought it was Penney's.

[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.880]
Where's that the one where they do the limbo rock under the Estal door?

[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.060]
And that was Dwight 2 as a matter of fact.

[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.060]
Now that you mentioned it.

[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.780]
390 votes on our pool.

[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:09.360]
Pretty well.

[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.800]
Well, we didn't get to started right away.

[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.120]
Did we?

[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.160]
I thought we did.

[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.840]
Like maybe half hour into the show.

[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:14.440]
Nah.

[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:15.540]
You nuts.

[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:16.600]
Yeah.

[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.580]
We headed on there.

[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.560]
But then we until we were dealing with it.

[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:19.820]
Yeah.

[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.180]
We were dealing with it and the pool too.

[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:27.360]
Since we don't do topics on the eruditor show, what's your favorite object of discussion?

[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.140]
Fully worded.

[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.660]
Internal WQM shenanigans 89.

[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.040]
In fact, a lot of people squeezed themselves when I hear.

[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:36.860]
Greg Hachew.

[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.160]
Politics 57.

[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.220]
Niels personal adventure is 43.

[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.520]
I'm going to go have lunch as soon as we get done here.

[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.140]
What are you going to have?

[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.220]
I don't know.

[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.100]
Soup.

[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.780]
Maybe some shallow and chup.

[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.780]
Maybe Betsy Everett now will do the chup chup shong to sing it together.

[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.740]
Religion 42.

[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:56.980]
Sex 34.

[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.660]
Local issues 24.

[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.780]
Georgia's homosexuality and the job performance 23.

[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.960]
Hachew 23.

[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:06.620]

[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.160]
Yeah.

[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:09.260]
Right, River.

[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.580]
He probably called up everybody he knew.

[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.400]
There.

[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.160]
Get on there right away.

[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.320]
Niel talked more about Hachew.

[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.440]
Will I talk more about Hachew?

[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:16.600]
No.

[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.720]
World affairs 21.

[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.900]
National news 14.

[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.340]
TV and movies 11.

[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:23.400]
Food 11.

[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.420]
And amazingly, he's looking to bottom there.

[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.600]
I'm looking at it.

[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.860]
It hasn't changed one ayoda.

[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.360]
Not even one got sympathy vote for health.

[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.140]
Not one fat person.

[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:36.280]
One vote for music and for health we got...

[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:36.500]
Oh!

[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.280]
And why should we be talking of health?

[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.100]
I'm sick as a dog.

[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:39.580]
Right.

[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.580]
The Humper's God is brothers out there calling in, you know, trying to pedal them drugs to get his...

[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:51.740]
You think during those days when you were doing the Atkins discussion, heavy duty and all these people were calling in,

[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.300]
you'd think somebody would vote for health.

[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.240]
They don't want to hear about it.

[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:54.920]
Don't you understand?

[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.540]
The people that were calling again, how about the music shows?

[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.700]
The lines ring off the hook.

[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.440]
I keep trying to tell you and it's easy to forget when you're doing a show.

[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.940]
The calls have nothing to do with how many people are listening.

[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:14.340]
You can do fire rhythms, you can do psychic readings, and the phones are ringing off the hook.

[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:14.660]
Right.

[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.760]
And as soon as the fire rhythm shows we used to do it with our neisotian.

[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:23.340]
And as soon as the person calls in and gets their personal whatever, yeah, they're gone.

[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.920]
They don't give a crap about anybody else's by rhythm.

[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:26.700]
So who gives a crap?

[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.820]
Astrological reading, right?

[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.060]

[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.660]
I mean they do care that...

[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:31.540]
Greg hates you.

[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.140]
...other than that.

[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:32.480]
Right.

[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.580]
Well that's big news.

[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.240]
Old news.

[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.260]
But nevertheless...

[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.000]
Back at you Greg.

[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.460]
12-12 on 5-6 days.

[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:42.040]

[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:42.460]
Q-A-M.

[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.580]
Call that a penis?

[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.040]
I'm kidding.

[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:18.080]
I feel under and kisses too.

[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.260]
I'll have a bone.

[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.380]
Look what we're through.

[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.760]
We're just standing in the back.

[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.140]
As we both enjoy the show.

[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.680]
It's changing when it's in the back.

[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.860]
Oh, glory.

[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.300]
Okay.

[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.340]
I have a19brok acceptance education.

[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.860]
My bokkeeen ran through.

[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:07.080]
Dosed a st in the block it's nobody at all.

[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.380]
As I turned my head to bed

[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.660]
I've seen and so forth.

[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.140]
He knows that I'm the brush and the paint.

[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:19.640]
But when we get back in 2018, I have a hell of a no.

[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.660]
That was fucking great.

[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:25.060]
I'm just a rock and a pop and through little morning,

[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.520]
morning glory hall.

[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.860]
Another train monkey.

[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:30.620]
Thank you very much.

[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:31.940]
1217, 560 QI.

[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.120]
I know I violated the two minute rule with that one,

[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.620]
but I thought it was topical and appropriate.

[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.420]
What does that mean?

[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.760]
Because that lady called with the Glory Hall report.

[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.620]
So what do you mean two minute rule?

[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.160]
I was only going to play two minute and over bits today,

[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.020]
just because you know you're sick and I'm lazy.

[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.260]
Are you being lazy?

[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.220]
Is that the cop out?

[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:49.660]
Yeah.

[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.840]
Like that bit said that called you that day.

[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.200]
Is it a cop out?

[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.260]
It's a cop out.

[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.140]
That we're not doing like topical talk,

[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.960]
radio every day, like old crap that went up with a high button

[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.760]
shoes that only 90 year old people want to hear.

[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:01.940]
Right, that bit.

[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.260]
Anyway, Lynn says she never did.

[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:03.920]
This is amazing.

[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:07.220]
She isn't going to be by because she doesn't have a driver

[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:07.660]
this time.

[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.780]
In other words, Ms. Grudge is otherwise occupied.

[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.280]
She had to show that.

[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.240]
Maybe it has something to do with his glory holes.

[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.720]
Ms. Grudge, maybe you're drilling for oil or news.

[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.800]
Well, she'll take a cab, a cab seat, a taxi over here.

[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.420]
She never learned to drive.

[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:22.080]
Get out of that.

[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.820]
Something when you live in a real city like New York

[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.060]
or here, for example, you don't have to have a car.

[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:26.360]
Right.

[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.280]
I never learned to drive.

[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.980]
So I said she could call on in a bad line,

[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:33.740]
which I emailed her or I'm thinking that her close personal

[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.540]
friend, Vokabrion, could pick her up and slip her around.

[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:37.580]
Why not?

[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.760]
So the least he can do.

[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.240]
Right, he brings her in.

[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.860]
We go to lunch and then you'll want to us.

[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.220]
We'll take her back to our home.

[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:44.860]
Yeah, wherever.

[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.220]
Right.

[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.480]
Matt wants to ever around.

[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:47.600]
He won't be in town.

[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.520]
How do you know that?

[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.260]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:51.980]
It was just I was making an excuse for him.

[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:54.620]
Maybe he'll be a JC pennies.

[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.480]
Don't get started.

[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.540]
OK, with Ms. Grudge.

[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:56.960]
All right.

[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:57.920]
Don't be getting me started.

[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:58.920]
Hey, he paid for lunch.

[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.060]
So he's all right by me.

[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:00.600]
Did he really?

[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.100]
He did for all of us.

[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:02.940]
That's what he.

[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:04.940]
You weren't there.

[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.400]
Oh, you're not invited.

[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.420]
You're small potatoes, smaller even.

[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.540]
So what about this story about this lady

[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:12.720]
a basketball player?

[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:13.280]
Huh?

[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.020]
Who turns her back on the flag?

[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.120]
It's on our website, Mr.

[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.060]
It's one of the stories I've bedtime stories.

[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.520]
In purchased New York.

[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.500]
An NCAA division three college basketball player

[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.480]
who turns away from the US flagger in the national anthem

[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.860]
was jeered by flag waving students at a road game

[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.160]
even while she was on the bench.

[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.120]
Tony Smith, a senior man,

[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.920]
and Hattonville College was booted Mount St. Mary

[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.280]
at a game Thursday night.

[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.340]
Smith is protesting that the government's

[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.980]
priorities are not on bettering the quality of life

[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.920]
for all of its people, but rather on expanding its own power.

[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.080]
She has turned away from the flag all season.

[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.520]
Before Thursday's game, the Mount St. Mary student government

[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.480]
handed out small flags more than 500 people

[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.900]
filled a small gym and jeered Smith at every opportunity.

[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.340]
Well, wasn't that nice and patriotic of them, huh?

[00:36:59.040 --> 00:36:59.300]
Sure.

[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:00.940]
At the end of the game between Mount

[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.040]
and Hattonville and Mount St. Mary,

[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.160]
the crowd sang, God bless America.

[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.900]
When Manhattanville played a US merchant marine academy

[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.140]
February 11, more than 300 flag waving midship

[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.540]
and greeted Smith with chance of USA and leave our country.

[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.340]
Leave our country.

[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.520]
In other words, it leave it or love it.

[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.780]
If you're the worst of the winners,

[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:18.520]
you don't think I got it.

[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:18.560]
You don't think I got it.

[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.000]
You don't think I got it.

[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:19.800]
You don't think I got it.

[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:20.660]
That's right.

[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.360]
As in water seats its own level.

[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.820]
When Smith picked up two thousand

[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.540]
the first three minutes and was benched to crowd-chanted,

[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.780]
we want Tony, according to the journal news.

[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.220]
Hence you went on with the statement of

[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.500]
you, Manhattanville president Richard Berman said he told Smith

[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.160]
what he's doing is courageous and difficult.

[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.560]
And he is absolutely correct.

[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:39.840]
So how do you like that?

[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.180]
Of course, remember how long ago was very shortly after 9-11?

[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.780]
When the administration started painting the Democrats,

[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.400]
they don't care about national security.

[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.860]
You know, you're either with us or against us in every respect.

[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.300]
And of course, if you were against it,

[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.980]
then you're at the very least unpatriotic and a scumbag.

[00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:57.700]
Right.

[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.940]
And I'd be buying a condo in the bag then.

[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.300]
And then the electric car.

[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:04.980]
And working on radio bag then.

[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.040]
I thought that was this.

[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.100]
I thought that was us.

[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.220]
That's what he was talking about.

[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:10.720]

[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.380]
Now the poll is being skewered now.

[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.740]
You know what I say?

[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.440]
Health, all of a sudden, went from none to 11.

[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:19.080]
Yeah.

[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.720]
Maybe, and this is right in the middle of lunch hour.

[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.860]
So I don't think that our diet conscious crowd out there.

[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:28.920]
I don't think they put down their four or five donuts.

[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.920]
Jelly filled chocolate covered.

[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.920]
438 votes.

[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.000]
Music to food 11 health 11.

[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:38.680]
Don't buy it.

[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.900]
TV in the movies 12 National News 17 World Affairs 20.

[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.080]
Georgia's affairs and job performance 24.

[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.160]
Local issues 26.

[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:48.860]
Hockey 26.

[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:49.900]
Yeah.

[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.080]
Yeah.

[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.460]
We believe you're rumour you clown.

[00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:00.080]
Sex 37, religion 46, Niels personal adventures 51.

[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.440]
I might have a diet iced tea with my lunch.

[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.620]
Or just a little bit more another tidbit.

[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:08.160]
Okay.

[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.180]
Politics 59.

[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.460]
And internal WQAM shenanigans 94.

[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.780]
Hands down, man.

[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.300]
Imagine what the radio would be.

[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.140]
The inside crap.

[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.520]
All these people over the years are too much inside stuff.

[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.060]
Too much inside.

[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.940]
I, I, I, yeah.

[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.020]
No way.

[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.180]
They can't get enough of the mole my structure that right now.

[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.240]
And that miserable nasty rotten hateful, sour, and at the

[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.020]
earth's turn.

[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:35.260]
All they want to talk about.

[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:35.820]
Right.

[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:36.600]
All these sites.

[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.780]
Is he really, yeah?

[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.700]
Is he really such a miserable prick?

[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.020]
Yes he is.

[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:41.880]
Oh, that's sick.

[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.220]
Does anybody really really despise him like poison?

[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.900]
You know, they love people that,

[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.200]
they really get the beast blown off of that show.

[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:50.300]
Yes.

[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.100]
How about Carolyn?

[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:51.560]
Yes.

[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.320]
How about those, not so idle threats about Zach?

[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.960]
Who we out of that on the year and had it like a virus and

[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.700]
box him into a corn?

[00:39:58.780 --> 00:39:59.020]
Yes.

[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:02.620]
And they think it's stick.

[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.020]
And it's not stick.

[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.220]
It's too bizarre to be real.

[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.320]
Don't, don't, don't, don't, yeah.

[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.160]
My thoughts are, Zach.

[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:07.540]
I think God's of Zach comes.

[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:08.880]
Haven't lunch and stuff.

[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.840]
Playing golf together.

[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:11.700]
Hmm.

[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:15.880]
Should we take a call or two?

[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.560]
Yeah, we're not.

[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.460]
They made the call.

[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.960]
Why not take it?

[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.700]
How come I, like I'm doing this?

[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.020]
No, you don't, I don't know.

[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.300]
You kind of slip pretty interesting.

[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:29.680]
I like segway from me being here to like help you out on the day that I'm sick.

[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.160]
And these, these things help a little bit in the beginning, you know?

[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.000]
Yeah.

[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.500]
These recall eyes, but then after all you start, don't sprain it.

[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.780]
Vail it at any time.

[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:38.920]
I'll read the numbers.

[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.200]
Yeah, now that it's 1225.

[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:40.840]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.920]
I gotta get out of here.

[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.640]
Yeah, see ya.

[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:48.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on Verizon and AT&T Wireless, 877.

[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.460]
Yeah, now that I've got our culture in half hours of the show for them, 7, 8, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5,

[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.080]
it's 12 percent.

[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.280]
He's a big achiever, right?

[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:54.540]
An underachiever.

[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:56.240]
So we'll get to the call.

[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.180]
Who's this in Miami?

[00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:57.560]
Hello?

[00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:58.840]
I'm on the wrong line.

[00:40:59.040 --> 00:40:59.040]

[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.100]
Miami online, 8, hello.

[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:00.980]
Hey, Neil.

[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:01.760]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.200]
Hey, uh, yeah, that last guy was right.

[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.560]
Uh, you're the only thing on the radio that's even slightly anti-war.

[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.140]
There's definitely no balance out there.

[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.040]
Definitely not.

[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:10.700]
Pretty sad.

[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:14.340]
But, um, actually, what I'm calling about was that, uh, horrific incident that happened

[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.280]
on the beach this weekend.

[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:15.820]
Uh-huh.

[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:16.460]
Uh-huh.

[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:17.680]
I've spent a lot of time on the beach.

[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:22.960]
I live on South Beach and I jog and swim and sunbathe and everything else out there.

[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.240]
And I always wondered to myself, what the hell are all these cops doing, rolling around

[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.980]
and gigantic SUVs out there?

[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.100]
I mean, uh, I can't explain what they're doing.

[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.220]
I really don't know what they're doing.

[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.460]
They're too lazy to walk, obviously.

[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.440]
And I don't know why they don't have motorcycles or, you know, ATVs or something like that.

[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.040]
I don't know what they're doing.

[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:41.860]
Kill some people.

[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:42.140]
Yeah.

[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.160]
I mean, that was just terrible.

[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.160]
I mean, this guy should never work again.

[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.160]
And I mean, the most of them are so arrogant.

[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:48.740]
Yeah, probably.

[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.240]
What do you mean, never work again?

[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.160]
I mean, he should be let go from the forest for that, for sure.

[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.940]
And then that's as much as should happen.

[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.120]
I'm just not going to go from the forest.

[00:41:58.460 --> 00:41:59.860]
Personally, I think he should be locked up.

[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.940]
But, you know, you can't really go out and say something like that, but yeah, I believe

[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:04.080]
it.

[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.600]
I feel he should be locked up.

[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.100]
I mean, I saw the story about the girls' parents coming into town.

[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.700]
I mean, I just can't imagine the horror for that family horror.

[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.680]
This was one o'clock in the afternoon in broad daylight.

[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.180]
There's complete arrogance of these guys.

[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.140]
They ride around with their arrogant attitude, thinking they're so great, they're not paying

[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.000]
attention to anything.

[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.880]
I think I don't need, they should be out there to begin with.

[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.520]
They can patrol on foot if they feel it's necessary to patrol the beach.

[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.520]
Even on horseback?

[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:32.440]
Something.

[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.460]
Yeah, not a gigantic five-time SUV.

[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:36.200]
Right.

[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.520]
I mean, I think the whole thing's just gotten me shaken up just because I say fries

[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.000]
ass.

[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.800]
I agree with that.

[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.220]
I agree, but you know, I don't want to come off down and too strong.

[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:46.860]
I'm sure he'll be back to work in a few days.

[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:47.940]
No, you got me.

[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.460]
You really believe that?

[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:54.100]
I do because, I mean, I don't see people sticking up for the little guy.

[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.180]
I've seen him sticking up for the police force.

[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.480]
I read the paper today.

[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.480]
A couple of witnesses were saying, oh, gee, I bet that officer's really shaken up.

[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.340]
I feel sorry for him.

[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.320]
Oh, how about these girls' families?

[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:03.800]
Yeah.

[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:03.900]
No.

[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:05.280]
Okay.

[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:06.480]
Good luck to us, pal.

[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:06.940]
Thanks.

[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.600]
You're showing excellent.

[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:08.440]
Thank you.

[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:08.740]
You're welcome.

[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.780]
I'll show you something.

[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.120]
We have a good, we got a new formula now, right?

[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.420]
Yeah, he must be really shaken up.

[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.360]
You know what?

[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.180]
You know what this makes of all over again?

[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:20.300]
It's that.

[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.660]
It's the FBI agent.

[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:22.940]
Right.

[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.840]
I was just like his friends at the FHP.

[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.040]
The same thing, you know?

[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.820]
One thing about South Florida cops can do no wrong no matter what it is.

[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:30.180]
Right.

[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.440]
You got to feel sorry for them.

[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.500]
They got a heavy burden, you know?

[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.160]
Fact of the matter is he was tooling around there like a wild man according to one account.

[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:38.600]
Right.

[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.740]
All day today they have the witness account and some videotape, not of the before the

[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:44.840]
incident, but no siren.

[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.160]
By the way, no siren to where anybody who was coming.

[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.040]
And of course when you're laying on a beach, you're not like constantly looking around to

[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.020]
see if like any gigantic vehicles come.

[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:53.840]
No, no, no, no.

[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.780]
What I'm saying is that you're on the beach.

[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:55.060]

[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.040]
I'm usually got my eyes closed or.

[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:57.700]
Yeah.

[00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:58.800]
I'm not on something else.

[00:43:59.000 --> 00:43:59.300]
Right.

[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.080]
Shame on you, officer.

[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.320]
Shame on you.

[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.040]
A typical South Florida effing disgrace.

[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.020]
1227, 560 QIM.

[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.460]
You're trying to pay for your trying to same diets over and over again.

[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:13.120]
And what I found is a lot of times something will work for you once and your brain kind

[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:13.960]
of outsmarts itself.

[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.080]
And you can never go back and do it again.

[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.040]
If you haven't tried balance for life, you have nothing to lose, but all of that weight.

[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:23.020]
There's no cooking, no shopping, no cleaning, no worries, just great results.

[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.120]
Like the beast is getting his lost over 50 pounds.

[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.000]
I guarantee we've saved that punk's life.

[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.800]
And once his head starts drinking normal size, you know, we're really doing a good job

[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.140]
for him.

[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.780]
They deliver your little black sack to your door by 6 a.m.

[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.720]
No matter where you are every morning, whether you're at work, whether you're at home,

[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.300]
whether you're at the massage parlor, three gourmet meals and two delicious snacks are

[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:41.060]
right in your black sack.

[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.120]
It's all prepared for you.

[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:43.580]
It's all fresh and delicious.

[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.940]
There are chicken dishes and beef and turkey and all kinds of good stuff.

[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.820]
Omelets and frittadas and you name it.

[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.120]
Nothing prefabricated, nothing frozen.

[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.300]
And they let you pick between two choices for each one of the meals every day that's

[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:54.780]
around a program.

[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:56.480]
That's the only choice you'll have to make.

[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.460]
They do all the figuring for you based on the zone diet.

[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.760]
So like I said, the food for the entire day is the new, you don't have to worry about

[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.680]
buying anything else and the weight just pours off your body.

[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.480]

[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.120]
My life and local.

[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.400]
This is 420-560.

[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.680]
I got those checkered pants.

[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:30.320]
Okay.

[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:38.620]
I heard some way that we're going to have some of Flemm filled fun and have ferritidized

[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:39.020]
today.

[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:44.760]
I know Hank Oldboy and Gennai had our differences in the past, but it's been brought to my

[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:50.560]
attention that Hank has arranged for some fee-y, e-full women to join us in a plushly-affirmed

[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.060]
studio.

[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.440]
Yeah, it's got a glamour queen from Key West.

[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:59.860]
By the way, something that hasn't escaped me that's around the knee with women is a good

[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.340]
way of keeping me from getting raped.

[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:05.460]
This has a big joy, humidity and respect from Hank.

[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.540]
Bigger than his pants.

[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:06.960]
Yeah.

[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.040]
They're coming in now.

[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:09.920]
Woohoo.

[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.600]
Put your teeth back in.

[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:14.320]
Oh my god.

[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.380]
It's easy.

[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:18.660]
Oh.

[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.980]
You may get her around.

[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:21.580]
It's a little bit more fun than me.

[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:22.280]
Hey.

[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.740]
Get a little bit of voices.

[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:24.640]
Yeah.

[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.020]
It must be heavy smokers.

[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:26.300]
Yeah.

[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.540]
So, what do you know?

[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:29.160]
What do you say?

[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.200]
There is a lady.

[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.080]
Oh, we're fine.

[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.360]
I won't growl in the back there.

[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.800]
A bit soft that goes you think.

[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:35.820]
Yeah.

[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.100]
They don't wait a minute, something.

[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.600]
Ain't you a guy of Peri Mason?

[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.380]
Oh, it's you, Mo.

[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:42.820]
Oh, you can't be.

[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.100]
Peri Mason, you're done.

[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:48.140]
Perhaps, but I'm still in better shape than you.

[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:48.960]
I didn't know.

[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:49.320]
Good.

[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.620]
You got some knife walking in here, just like that.

[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:57.000]
Would you mind sharing with the court exactly why we were asked here today?

[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.160]
But why, certainly.

[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.800]
It's an offering of peace from Hank Goldbiker.

[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.420]
And all of God.

[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:07.440]
Wasn't it you, Mo, who called the Key West Queens Agency and said, help me.

[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.020]
My show is dying.

[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.860]
No, it's not true.

[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:11.240]

[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:14.980]
And wasn't it you, Mo, who said rapes not money?

[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:15.880]
Okay.

[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:16.560]
Okay.

[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.220]
Oh, yes, it was me.

[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:19.440]
It was me.

[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.920]
I said rapes not money.

[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.620]
I submit your honor that Mo submits.

[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:27.320]
Wait a minute.

[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.700]
I fell rule.

[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.180]
What's the meaning of it?

[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:30.780]
Come on, girls.

[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:32.760]
Let's make him out of it.

[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.700]
I got it black.

[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.400]
I got it black.

[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:38.940]
I got it black.

[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:42.100]
And I got it.

[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.220]
I got it black.

[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.120]
I got it black.

[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.160]
I got it black.

[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.500]
I got it black.

[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.680]
27 to 1 on 560 QA.

[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.140]
This is the easiest show I ever did.

[00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.920]
Even easier than those poll building shows.

[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.400]
You should have called it six more often.

[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.020]
Easiest show he ever did.

[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.040]
What is that mean?

[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:08.540]
That's a joke.

[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.540]
I mean, it's the easiest show you never did.

[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:10.740]
Right.

[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.540]
There you go.

[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:13.840]
This is great.

[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:17.360]
476 votes.

[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.540]
And he stays quiet.

[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.180]
Just knowing that you're going to pick it up.

[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.060]
Hey, you two could do the show.

[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.280]
Not bad.

[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.000]
Please, he's spicked.

[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:26.860]
Or to give away.

[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.140]
So in other words, there was never any extension of sympathy

[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:34.660]
or hopefully he'll be feeling better soon or croak rapidly

[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:35.920]
or something like that from who?

[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.440]
For my good close personal friend in the morning who preceded us this morning.

[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:43.800]
Well, I only heard that you know the last two-minute crossover thing there.

[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.880]
Not a word, not a thing.

[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.820]
And I understand you know how they're busy.

[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:50.400]
Sometimes they back themselves up.

[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:51.700]
They don't have the time.

[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:52.720]
He's backed up.

[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.660]
Gelly keeps telling me his bag keeps backing up as well.

[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:57.560]
Gelly tells me.

[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:02.100]
You know, Gelly with a squeaky voice that Joe Rose got into QA a minute many years ago.

[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.100]
He's one of those people that shows up and never goes away.

[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.640]
Oh, and speaking of those guys.

[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:12.580]
So evidently, Judge McDonald, you know who does the Panther Games on a radio?

[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:12.960]
Right?

[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:17.660]
Gelly is making a full-core press because this season, you know, we only got about 20 games to go.

[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.720]
And next season is like touching Go.

[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:24.660]
I still hear the rumors that the Panthers won't be on QA next year that they'd rather have the heat.

[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:26.420]
All right.

[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:31.220]
So Gelly's now in this jockeying position where he and his buddy Mo,

[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:36.380]
I guess this is what the payback for Gelly sucking up to him all the rest of the time to keep his job.

[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:39.740]
Is that Mo joins in with the jugs sparing?

[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.440]
Can we say that sparing the jugs?

[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:41.680]
Sure.

[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:42.840]
In the back?

[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:43.520]
Sometimes.

[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:44.640]
Columnum jugs, McDonald.

[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.460]
All these other terrible, terrible things.

[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:47.700]
Shame on you, Mo.

[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:50.640]
You old guys like you and jugs ought to stick together.

[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.480]
All you 65 plus 70 plus guy.

[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:55.940]
Hey, he's 50 something.

[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:56.480]
Yeah.

[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.780]
Oh my god.

[00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.180]
From him.

[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.520]
I think he left the first digit off.

[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.800]
He says he's in his mid 50s.

[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:05.600]
Here's Miami.

[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:05.980]
Hello.

[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.600]
Hey, you sound better, Neil.

[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.220]
I am doing a little better, yeah.

[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.700]
I call them out front line, but let me just say the mo bits.

[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.780]
I wish they were half as funny as the bits to be honest with you.

[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:15.340]
The show you mean?

[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.520]
You know kidding.

[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.840]
I listen to first the last five minutes waiting for you to come on pathetic.

[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:29.140]
And Gelly is the main, the one thing I don't understand is Gelly is the main thing that's been there all along and that shows sucked ever since he's been on there.

[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:30.680]
Yeah, I don't want to act in.

[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.340]
Anyway, the front line thing.

[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.120]
I thought you watched it so I didn't call on to make any comments about it.

[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:36.600]
I'm going to say it.

[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.280]
Now, let's see it.

[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.240]
First of all, you can look it up online.

[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:47.800]
And second of all, the just if it was when Papa Bush was in power, there was a man in the Pentagon who wrote a report saying since the USSR fell.

[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.980]
And we were the most powerful nation in the world.

[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:54.160]
We had the right to go out and stomp the crap out of any country that wasn't a democracy.

[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:55.900]
And we would make them a democracy.

[00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:01.900]
And when Papa Bush read the report, he had a fit that the idea that the United States would even consider behaving that way.

[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:04.820]
They put the report up up in the cabinet.

[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:11.140]
And when now in GW after World Trade Center thing, the same guy brought the report back to him and that's the Bush doctor.

[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.020]
And it's almost word to word with this guy wrote.

[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:17.280]
You have the right to go out and keep the crap out of any country you want, preempt a strike or anything.

[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:21.200]
And you have to really see the whole show to see how it works.

[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.860]
It shows the struggle between Colin Powell and this other guy for how the United States would behave in the world.

[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:26.440]
Definitely.

[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:27.780]
No, no, no.

[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:29.740]
Richard Pearl, Libby, one of them.

[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.420]
No, no, I never heard of this guy before.

[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:34.120]
I don't know what I can't tell his name.

[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:35.980]
It wasn't the name that I heard before.

[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:37.620]
The guy who wrote the report.

[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:42.100]
But they said to him and his group are the extreme hawks in the Pentagon.

[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:49.180]
And Colin Powell has been trying to fight them off ever since he, you know, he was against them and their policies.

[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:52.900]
Instead of being diplomatic in the world, just go out and kick the crap out of everybody.

[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.200]
That's basically what the show says.

[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.360]
And GW has dropped it, adopted that.

[00:51:58.500 --> 00:51:59.600]
And I hope you're feeling better.

[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:00.620]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:06.640]
Yeah, let's kiss the ground that we had a president who listens to the more moderate elements in his party all the time.

[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:08.120]
Sorry, miss that show.

[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.020]
The board again, right wing fanatics.

[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.980]
Well, we can look it up on the website on pbs.com.

[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.160]
Okay, in front line.

[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.980]
Sounds like a bunch of pinko, comi propaganda to me.

[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:17.660]
Yeah.

[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:22.700]
Oh, you want me to take that?

[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.220]
No, I purposely left that to see what you were going to do there.

[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.580]
I purposely did that because Carlos made a comment before.

[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:32.040]
And you sucked me into doing this without even my realizing, you know, the autonomous lawyer kind of thing.

[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.580]
Get into a conversation back and forth and all of a sudden, like I'm doing a show again.

[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.200]
Yeah, I'm supposed to be here lending a little oral surprise today.

[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.520]
Of course, but that's all I'm the slick spec.

[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.960]
Yeah, I had some things that I wanted to talk about, but you have no interest in any of that.

[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:44.540]
So we can, you know, just go on.

[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.740]
Like, you know, so what is it?

[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:54.420]
The celebrity bull crap reality show and the sisters while we already did discuss the sisters on the beach.

[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:54.940]
The transplant.

[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:56.420]
The markets in the tank.

[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.180]
Oh, that's right.

[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.940]
I wanted you to keep him a breast of that.

[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.240]
So we wouldn't have to flip back and forth.

[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.360]
Oh, yeah, that was down 150.

[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.460]
Then I asked that about 20.

[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.220]
I was going to talk about transplant girl.

[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:09.120]
And how we shouldn't be creating incentives for illegal aliens to come over here.

[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.040]
We already been through this.

[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:10.840]
You already said that.

[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:11.420]
Okay.

[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:17.520]
And you don't want to talk about dare devil about what dare devil.

[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.340]
It's number one again and it sucks.

[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:21.420]
It's weak.

[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.400]
Dare devil with your best close personal friend Ben Affleck.

[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:26.980]
Oh, that was that piece of crap.

[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:27.740]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:29.560]
So you don't want to talk about that.

[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:30.260]
No, I don't.

[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:33.660]
Why would I want to talk about it when I haven't seen it and I will not see it?

[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:35.540]
But he's worried about that.

[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:36.480]
Talk to my statement about it.

[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:37.380]
He's probably got some opinions.

[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.420]
He's worried about leather tights.

[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.320]
I've seen the pictures.

[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.760]
Okay, not interested.

[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.180]
I have two words to describe Ben Affleck in his current condition.

[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:47.400]
Old troll.

[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:47.980]
Okay.

[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:48.400]
Okay.

[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:49.440]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.260]
Hey, how are you?

[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:52.280]
We're great.

[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.180]
Good.

[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:53.740]
No, I just want to say.

[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:54.900]
Oh, Neil said, but you know.

[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:55.760]
Well, sure.

[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.740]
It's just for a poetic justice.

[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:02.660]
I felt that the cop that ran over those two women should be made to serve their time in France in a prison.

[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:04.420]
Oh, French prison.

[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.020]
Yeah.

[00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:05.680]
Bad height.

[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:06.500]
I'm safe, preferably.

[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:08.100]
Okay.

[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.200]
How about our elbow?

[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:09.200]

[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.440]
I don't think so.

[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.200]
Elbow, maybe.

[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:13.660]
All right.

[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:14.660]
Just having the elbow room.

[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:15.320]
And I would be okay.

[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.460]
I heard they still have Napoleon's penis in storage there.

[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:20.100]
It's your artifact.

[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:21.500]
That's a true story.

[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:23.520]
They've got his penis.

[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:24.640]
Hollywood, hello.

[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:25.820]
How are you doing?

[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:26.480]
All right.

[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:31.160]
Hey, before we blame this cop about what's happened, let's really take a look at.

[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:35.240]
With all the warnings about skin cancer, what are these girls doing laying out on the floor?

[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:35.960]
Oh, yeah.

[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.180]
That's a good point.

[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:45.900]
I'm glad to be here.

[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:46.540]
I'll tell you that.

[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:47.480]
Right?

[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:48.060]
Where it's cold.

[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.220]
I'm sure delighted to be here, eh?

[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.340]
With the weather's cold, but their hearts are warm.

[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:51.860]
Right.

[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:52.580]
That's right.

[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:53.820]
Good point down there.

[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.200]
The weather is warm, but their hearts are cold.

[00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:58.100]
Hard, hearted sons of bitches.

[00:54:58.580 --> 00:54:58.760]
Yeah.

[00:54:58.920 --> 00:54:59.800]
And for that last guy.

[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:00.900]
Your heart is dirty.

[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:01.300]
Right.

[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.480]
Coral gables, hello.

[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:04.100]
Hey, how are you doing, George?

[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:04.380]
All right.

[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:05.640]
All right.

[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.200]
Sorry about that.

[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:07.440]
Thank you.

[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:08.360]
That's better.

[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:08.940]
Yeah.

[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:09.160]
I want to go.

[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:09.160]

[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:10.720]
I wanted to talk about that front line show.

[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:16.040]
That color, just a couple of calls ago, I did a pretty good summary of the show, Neil.

[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:21.980]
But the name of the organization is called Policy for the New American Century, PNAC,

[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:22.560]
P-MAC.

[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:26.840]
You can look them up on the internet, a newamericancensory.org.

[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:31.560]
And you can see their plan written out as the color was correct.

[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.520]
We talked about that about several months ago.

[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:36.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:36.940]
Absolutely.

[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:41.860]
But he was mistaken that the Bush didn't pull it out post 9-11.

[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:46.640]
They had this, after Poppy Bush was not reelected.

[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:46.920]
Right.

[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:50.920]
They had to groom another candidate that would follow through on their policy.

[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:51.360]
That's right.

[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:56.620]
We Clinton just had the nerve to interrupt their plans, which is why they tried so desperately to get him in peach and get him out of office.

[00:55:57.060 --> 00:56:00.900]
So they can get controls again and get back in there and continue over the left off.

[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:02.600]
And that's why they had a stealing election.

[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:03.540]
There's no question about it.

[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:04.080]
Absolutely.

[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:12.220]
In the show, it really went over about how Wolfowitz and Richard Perl and Condi Rice were training Bush on world policy to try and train him.

[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.040]
Who were the good, the quote, good guys and bad guys.

[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:15.860]
They had to go outside.

[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:17.300]
According to their policy.

[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:21.080]
And remember the reporter asked him, do you know who the president of Pakistan is?

[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:24.260]
Yeah, sure he couldn't even find those places on a map.

[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.080]
Well, that's absolutely correct.

[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:33.900]
But I believe that that was part of Bush's obfuscation here, pretending that he didn't know who the leader of Pakistan was.

[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.300]
He didn't have to pretend, believe me.

[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:41.680]
Well, possibly, but he was being briefed during his election campaign.

[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:51.420]
He was being briefed on the pros and cons of whichever Muslim or dictatorship or whichever kind of leader would work on our quote, our side.

[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:58.000]
And this is what Condi Rice and Richard Perl, these are the groups that cost up this plan.

[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.220]
And part of it is, yeah, exactly.

[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:04.380]
Part of it, of course, is this pipeline deal that's going across Afghanistan.

[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:05.300]
Absolutely.

[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:15.820]
And I just read in the New York Times or somewhere on the weekend that apparently this pipeline deal has been signed up to move this pipeline through Afghanistan.

[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.640]
The patrolling, I've got to write here, the patrolling ministers of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan on Saturday,

[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:30.360]
reached an agreement to invite India for a multi-billion dollar pipeline to carry Turkmenistan's natural gas to the Indian Ocean via Afghanistan and Pakistan.

[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:32.900]
But remember now, it's not about oil.

[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:33.520]
Right.

[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:34.960]
It's not, no oil has nothing to do with it.

[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:43.820]
But it was already well documented that before 9-11, that the Taliban were our good buddies and we were going to work with them to build this Afghan pipeline.

[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:50.460]
And then when they turned tail and they decided to decide with the bin Laden, then all of a sudden they became the bad guys and they were oppressing their women

[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:53.100]
and they were oppressing the men and all of a sudden they were evildoers.

[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.380]
Just like now, they're screaming about how Saddam Hussein gasped his own people.

[00:57:56.660 --> 00:58:01.880]
But back when he was doing it at number one, we sold him the gas and number two, we didn't say a goddamn thing about it and couldn't have cared less.

[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:02.520]
Yeah.

[00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:05.160]
Now all of a sudden we're all indignant because he gasped his own people.

[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:05.780]
Yeah.

[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:06.700]
Who by how are we kidding?

[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:11.460]
Well, you know there are questions about whether that gas was used by Iraq or actually...

[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:12.580]
By Iran.

[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:20.440]
Exactly because it was the Kurdish population that Iran didn't have, doesn't have any, how should we say any love for the Kurdish population there.

[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.380]
In northern Iraq.

[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:26.340]
So of course gasping was a horrendous war crime on any population.

[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:34.100]
But the way that Bush and Powell and the rest of these guys continue to lie to us repeatedly with this false evidence.

[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:36.980]
These are impeachable crimes, Neil.

[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.380]
And I think that we need to get impeachable.

[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:40.060]
Hold your breath, man.

[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:41.180]
Okay. Thanks a lot.

[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:41.500]
Thank you.

[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:42.260]
Thank you.

[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.100]
1244, got to go.

[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:46.420]
560 QAM.

[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:47.880]
The guy's size matters big time.

[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:51.880]
According to the Florida Department of Labor, computer professionals have got really big ones.

[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.620]
And of course we're talking about paychecks.

[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:57.640]
According to the state of Florida, computer careers are among the highest paid and the highest demand.

They're in Kindle, Miami for Lauderdale and Pembert Pines.

[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:16.140]
With day evening and weekend schedules, there's absolutely no excuse to stay in a crappy dead end job, making a paupery sum and working for some schmuck when you can start making big bucks.

[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:41.040]
We're sports radio 560, UAM.

[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:44.780]
2 sets of lifts.

[00:59:49.040 --> 01:00:00.680]
If you cannot find the sum of armor rack, if the markets are a form of armor rack, if the terrorists are frisky tankers, then it's looking shifty.

[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.580]
The North Korea is too risky, bomber rack.

[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:16.640]
If we have no allies with the bomber rack, if we think that someone's business from a rack, so to hell with the inspections, let's look up for the elections.

[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.700]
Close your mind and take directions, bomber rack.

[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.720]
Fall in line and bomb the borders, bomber rack.

[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.660]
Fall in line and bomb the borders, bomber rack.

[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:35.740]
Disagree will call the trees and let's make more of the season even if we have no reason, bomber rack.

[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:37.740]
Let's go on, it's funny.

[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.200]
Oh, what?

[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:45.880]
Sorry, I was just distracted by Mark Anthony's monkey face over here on E, since they're showing clips from the Grammys and since I didn't see it, I want to see what people were wearing.

[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:46.720]
Oh my god.

[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:51.140]
And I think we solved the mystery of the Indian monkey man. There he is.

[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:52.100]
Really? The monkey man.

[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.040]
There was a more monkey looking man.

[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.660]
He couldn't be the monkey man because we liked the monkey man on this show.

[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:12.960]
Anyway, front line, if you go to a PBS.org and just take the programs go to front line or just do a search for a front line, the war behind closed doors, the evolution of the Bush doctrine, and starting tomorrow, from our history of the 25th, starting tomorrow, you'll be able to see the whole program online.

[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.140]
Okay, but in the meantime, you can read or print out all kinds of.

[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:24.660]
Okay, I just mentioned because I didn't see the show and I'm sorry that I didn't because obviously was well worth seeing.

[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:32.240]
I like people reading to me, but nobody watches PBS so they're filled on who does so I'll get a little later on.

[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.180]
Yeah, nobody watches him.

[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:34.580]
So you know something has something coming.

[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:40.180]
So I was a worried that we were going to have time to take all these calls before the next break since we backed ourselves up.

[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:42.980]
Oh, yeah, but since they're hard to let's just take the next break.

[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.560]
Since there aren't any calls, we could read the results of the poll one more time.

[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:48.260]
Since it's a hundred percent.

[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:48.920]
We really want to do that.

[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.740]
Triple digits for that first place, place, internal go 192 votes.

[01:01:54.580 --> 01:02:02.640]
So you're absolutely wrong because I didn't even let you give the results of yesterday's or the Friday weekend poll until like at least 935 or 940.

[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.960]
No, I thought it was earlier than that.

[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:05.980]
So we blew off almost the whole first hour.

[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.020]
I'm just mentioning that.

[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:08.300]
Okay, that's a good excuse anyway.

[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:08.960]
Right.

[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:10.820]
They heard your voice.

[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.900]
I mean, 493 votes.

[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.500]
Which of these things you like here and most about is the best way to say this.

[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:23.320]
Which of these topics, objects, internal QM shenanigans 102, politics 69.

[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:24.840]
You're making that up.

[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:35.360]
Niels personal adventure is 57, religion 56, sex 44, Georgia's sexuality slash job performance 29 or sexual performance 29.

[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.320]
Local issues 28, hockey 28.

[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:38.940]
Right.

[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:39.540]

[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:50.040]
World affair 24, national news 17, TV and or movies 12, health 12, went from zero to 12 like just like that.

[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:50.540]
Six, six, six.

[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:54.820]
And I shot food 11 and music only three.

[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:55.720]
That's it.

[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.380]
I don't suppose that I'm 500 vote.

[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.140]
9 to 1 on 560 WQ a.

[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:31.120]
Voice of the party

[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:38.140]
Hey, boneless life, smoke and drink, cause we're all gonna die.

[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:49.420]
Jimmy Carter thought he was using his head.

[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:53.340]
The farmer, the guy he went to talk to now is dead.

[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:56.800]
Ain't like queer.

[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.160]
That's what you get for eating peanuts and drinking Billy beer.

[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:15.540]
Hey, boneless life, hey, boneless life, smoke and drink, cause we're all gonna die.

[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.800]
Shedding tear for peace, because we all are gonna die.

[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:25.280]
Where you dumb enough to think, one day we'd all become allies.

[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:34.040]
4 to 1 on 5 6 6 2 a.m. I'm really excited about the results of the poll by the way.

[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:39.480]
We actually had conversations inside this building where people have had them with me about the logic of airing our dirty laundry.

[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:46.280]
Really? Like, back during the bow and Joe show, remember when Joe Castello had that altercation with Boat Stuff?

[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.580]
Yeah, and he, I mean, how could it not be funny? He spat in all of under her boob for Christ'sakes.

[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:57.300]
And there were people who this day, Clarence, who had their line, oh Clarence tells you that nobody wants you to the instant.

[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.780]
Let me, let me say something to Clarence.

[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.240]
Okay, that wasn't a quote by, you know, stick to sports, Clarence.

[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:05.700]
Okay, stick to something you know about, cause talk radio is definitely not one of them.

[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:09.880]
Okay, stick to sports, which is marginal. Forget about women, cause they already forgot about you.

[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:16.260]
And definitely stay out of talk radio. Okay, Clarence, see it was because Joe Castello had asked me not to repeat the story on that.

[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.800]
And the air because he was afraid that he might get in trouble over the altercation.

[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.320]
Screw that. Okay, that way.

[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.600]
That's such a pussy. Were you? It was way too funny.

[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:26.180]
Well, I think Joe was winking all the while that he told me not to say that on the air, you know?

[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:35.100]
Yeah, but here's the fact I heard on C-Spanish today that they're repeating the front lines who on PBS Wednesday, 9 to 10 p.m.

[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:40.460]
And I'd be a good day for it, cause Wednesday is, what are they calling it again?

[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:44.560]
Oh, the national virtual march. Right, Washington.

[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:51.100]
Virtual March Wednesday, February 26th, and supporters are calling on everybody to fax remail senators and the White House during business hours.

[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:58.360]
We'll talk about that more tomorrow and Wednesday, of course, when it happens at 26th. And also, this is cute. You read this.

[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:08.000]
Yeah, this is cute. It says that a crisis you and security council meeting this morning, Colin Powell requested a final chance to convince the world of claims that Warwood Sodom was the only option.

[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.920]
A hushed silence fell over the room. Ko-fi-Anon, Mr. Powell, what proof do you have that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction?

[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:17.520]
Colin Powell, we kept the receipts.

[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:22.020]
Cute, pretty cute. Thank you, Davy. Fort Lauderdale, hello.

[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.440]
Hello. Hello.

[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:26.620]
Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Couple observations.

[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:34.180]
You know to talk about getting a liberal voice, I would like to nominate you to debate that bombastic buffalo rush limbaugh.

[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:40.880]
He couldn't debate his way out of a punctured condom. I know because of having a lot of waste my time doing that.

[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:45.680]
Well, listen, don't you appreciate a punctured condom at least to see it fall apart?

[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:50.200]
Well, don't you understand he's preaching to the choir? Don't you?

[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:54.560]
That's what I mean, but that's why it doesn't make any difference. There he was not relevant.

[01:06:54.780 --> 01:07:00.920]
He won't debate anybody. Maybe his but revato chicken hawks will know who he is. And now let me give you something else.

[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:06.020]
You know something about Mr. GW was an admitted alcoholic till he was 40.

[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:10.700]
I want to know one thing. What you know about alcoholics, I know about alcoholics.

[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.240]
I submit that he is so without alcohol.

[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:14.820]
Oh, that's it.

[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:16.460]
It's so good. Have a nice one.

[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.800]
Well, hey, that's really we've been doing pretty good today, Carlos.

[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:23.680]
Why do you put on this old, funny dirty, dirty, old show? I mean, I can't believe what the guy is saying.

[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:26.820]
You know, he's coming from the right place, but he's also coming from a hundred.

[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:30.560]
Okay, that's the reason we stopped doing typical talk radio a long time ago.

[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:36.680]
Those of us who had a mind and a brain and had this desire to survive and eat and, you know, do those things.

[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.980]
Have ratings. Have a future. Right.

[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.160]
Look at all the other talk stations that are still thriving and breathing.

[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.980]
I guess I'll have a young whippersnapper.

[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:48.580]
Oh, yeah, we put on a young voice to get past Carlos.

[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:51.940]
Well, boy, that sure wasn't easy show. I did their filling in for you today.

[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:53.820]
Yeah, sure wasn't easy show. You didn't do today.

[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:56.600]
He's a cake, man. Just like a fallen off a log.

[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:02.480]
He didn't manage his next tank three to seven from Shulas at seven o'clock.

[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.480]
And quick to win shows with a sore throat. Oh, sorry.

[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.480]
And a Shulas think he's going to be eaten. Sip goes panthers preview.

[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.580]
Panthers and the sabers at seven, 80.

[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:15.100]
Go see the panthers tonight. The sabers. The panthers are red hot at the Macarena.

[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.940]
Eddie K after the game. Joanne March.

[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.220]
And quick, but our poll, rumor.

[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.900]
Oh, I'm the Roger Show. I'm five six.

[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.100]
Don't you QA M might be for learning.

[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:23.860]
Oh.
