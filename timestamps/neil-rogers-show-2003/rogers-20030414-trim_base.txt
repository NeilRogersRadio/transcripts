[00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.840]
We must go to the Quattro.

[00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.960]
This week on ABC, the Bachelor with Bill Clinton.

[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.980]
We actually did it.

[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.280]
It's more than 100,000 positions, and we're not brewed.

[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.660]
I've done it since I was a boy, and I'm gonna keep brought on doing it until I can't do it anymore.

[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.920]
Bill Clinton as the Bachelor.

[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.260]
She wanted to bend over backwards.

[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.640]
Yes, yes, yes, do it, do it, do it.

[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.120]
Brackdom.

[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.260]
901 at 560 WQM, happy-wunded to him.

[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.960]
Can't you feel there's something in the ear?

[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.020]
I feel something.

[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.580]
I think it's the Tsar's.

[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.500]
Sorry.

[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.580]
Now there's something in the ear, man.

[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.880]
There's something really good on the horizon.

[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.280]
We don't know what it is yet, but you can't almost smell it.

[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.080]
Maybe that's most peace on the way up the door.

[00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.040]
Hey Mo, watch that damn thing.

[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.280]
Will you?

[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.520]
Everybody started to talk about it.

[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.760]
Even Mufflin came in this morning, said, man, did you smell that damn thing?

[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.320]
You hear him?

[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.620]
He said he's been...

[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.700]
He just...

[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.140]
Keep that peace at home, okay Mo?

[00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.740]
Keep the peace at home.

[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.660]
We got some bad news though to start this week.

[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.120]
Very, very bad news.

[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.760]
What, I'm back?

[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.000]
Oh, I forgot about that.

[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.400]
We got two pieces of bad news.

[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.020]
George is back.

[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.080]
We had a great week with Ochoa.

[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.960]
I mean, last week.

[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.360]
Yeah.

[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.960]
We did ripped you an ass, right?

[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.260]
And especially, beener boy.

[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.660]
He was ripped you, stabbed you in the back, and then of course, Miguel went off there

[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.260]
and took your 300 bucks from Treasure Island.

[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.940]
That seems to be the big story, the big countertumps this morning is at Miguel.

[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.060]
He was playing fast and loose with George's appearance while George was up there

[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.460]
in North Carolina.

[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.880]
I think he knew that I was going up there.

[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.040]
You were like sacrificing 300 bucks, which is schlepper little beener like you can't afford to be doing.

[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.600]
No, I cannot.

[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.260]
And he knew I was going to be gone.

[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.480]
And he was going to be out.

[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.680]
That's why he moved through his hands a little.

[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.780]
That's the smart way you do it.

[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260]
You know that the enemy is going to be gone and you're moved right in.

[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.460]
Kind of like in Baghdad.

[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.380]
But we don't want to get to that yet, because I'm in too bit of a mood.

[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.580]
Anyway, bad news though, hip-the-a-music.

[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.000]
She's dead.

[00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.700]
A little Eva's dead.

[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.560]
Hey, what's this? Talk up.

[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.560]
She's died.

[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.020]
Don't step on it.

[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.380]
Everybody's doing my friends dead now.

[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.180]
A good friend Dick Feinberg at Pompadot Park says on Saturday night.

[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.020]
You better start the show.

[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.400]
Please start the show on Monday with little Eva.

[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.900]
And look at most of them.

[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.400]
I said why?

[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.560]
Why Dick?

[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.160]
And he said,

[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.820]
He died.

[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.740]
And that's what he said.

[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.260]
By the way, Brian Sirus, thank you so much, even though you're not in town anymore.

[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.880]
Boy, did he do a great job at Pompadot Park or what?

[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.880]
I put him all to shame.

[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.880]
Nice going, Brian.

[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.040]
He drove circles around him.

[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.340]
Another big night Saturday.

[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.220]
And Rich had the four over the two, seven, eight, and the seven to broke and ran into the three.

[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.220]
And anyway, you don't want to hear those things.

[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.560]
Rich is still eaten, by the way.

[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.460]
Oh, I almost forgot about that.

[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.100]
My good friend Derek, who's been lecturing me that I have to take care of Fat Rich and overseeing.

[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.760]
Keep him alive.

[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.200]
This is, this is, I almost forgot this all together.

[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.040]
A grotesque story.

[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.380]
Or did a big piece of apple pie with whipped cream and gave about a third of it to Fat Rich after he had shoveled the rolls and a steak and enough food to feed the Chinese army.

[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.300]
Well, he said his blood sugar was a little bit low.

[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.600]
You want to pick a date on the calendar for the Fat Man?

[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.700]
Anyway, singer Little Eva, who has a teenager record of the hit 1960s dance on the locomotion.

[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.000]
The locomotion.

[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.120]
Sorry, sorry.

[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.340]
Well, I tell you, we had such a good time without you last year.

[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.760]
Yeah, that's great.

[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.960]
Has died after a long battle with cervical cancer her manager said on Friday, she was 59, just a veritable child.

[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.340]
Now, while you punks out there who don't know who Little Eva was, while shame on you, in fact, that inspired me.

[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.940]
Either tomorrow or sometime this week, we're going to do another one of our famous musicals that the audience hates like poison.

[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.200]
But it sure gets a lot of response on the phone.

[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.660]
You know that?

[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.440]
The hell yeah.

[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.280]
Huh?

[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.020]
Yeah, does that really does?

[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.980]
They'll be calling in from O'Choppy and two egg and all over the state, making all kinds of suggestions.

[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.120]
The best marginal, how do we say it?

[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.140]
The best obscure was good when you were saying that.

[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.040]
The best obscure recording artist of all time.

[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.680]
In other words, your favorite of all time who wasn't like a real big star.

[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.200]
You mentioned him, nobody knows who you're going to talk about.

[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.580]
Somebody of obscure like Elvis.

[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.940]
Even our sissusboy.on Thursday at Lenore Memorial Hospital in Kingston, North Carolina, manager Brenda Cavesin.

[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.780]
I was Kingston anywhere near where you were staying?

[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.060]
Lenore too far if it's near that.

[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.800]
Well, I'll be damned.

[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.820]
She had cancer, she fought it for a long time, Cavesin.

[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:29.020]
Boyd was working as a babysitter for songwriter's Carol King and Jerry Goughlin when they asked her to record a song they'd written called The Locomotion in 1962.

[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.580]
I was living in Boston, Mass, I'm coming to El Salvador.

[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.780]
I remember Bruce Bradley playing Locomotion on WBZ back in the days when Radio was really great and Teep channeled and owned every goddamn station on the dial.

[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.780]
Back when we had personalities, remember those days?

[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.120]
No.

[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.640]
Probably not.

[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.280]
Unless you're old like me.

[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.620]
We used to have every radio station had big, big personalities, you know?

[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.840]
Yeah.

[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.820]
Not anymore.

[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:58.260]
Now you've got the same half dozen stupid ass-indicated talking heads, the same poppies which we'll get to the weekend pull in a moment.

[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.240]
Boyd was working as a babysitter and she recorded the song.

[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.780]
The song was hit for a little even that year and again for Grand Funk Railroad in 1974.

[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.560]
Boyd had other minor hits including Keep Your Hands Off My Baby in 1962 and Old Smokey Locomotion in 1962.

[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.340]
I never heard that. Old Smokey Locomotion?

[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.020]
No.

[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.660]
She sang background for the Drifter's, Benny, King and others and the sad part of it is that they left out.

[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.320]
She was the lead singer for a group called The Cookies who had a big, big hit called Don't Say Nothing Bad About My Baby.

[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.880]
Let's hear that.

[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.600]
Oh, we don't have it?

[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.340]
No.

[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.660]
I bet you do have it there somewhere.

[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.900]
Well, forget about it.

[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.260]
Do you remember that song?

[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.660]
No.

[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.680]
Don't say nothing.

[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.740]
But I want to hear it.

[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.060]
Kev said Boyd continued to work till October 2001 when she became two weeks from her illness to perform.

[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.680]
She survived by two daughters of son, 15 grandchildren and nine great grandchildren.

[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.300]
I'll be damned for Leleva's dead and we're pretty pissed off about it on this show.

[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.440]
In fact, I think probably magic is going to play all little evil all week in honor of that.

[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.960]
I mean, it could get a little repetitious but probably not more so than their usual programming.

[00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.760]
So guess who I ran into with the airport yesterday.

[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.360]
I was leaving and he was coming back in.

[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.360]
I'll give you 400 guesses.

[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.160]
Well, I know who.

[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.520]
Well, I told you before the show.

[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.860]
Amanda.

[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.720]
All right.

[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.440]
And we had little chat.

[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.320]
He little reddened the face from a few too many green lizards up there in Augusta.

[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.620]
He said it was it was pouring outside and they were busy pouring inside all week is what he was saying.

[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.200]
And the weather was horrible.

[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.900]
You ought to see what's on the front page of the national poster.

[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.080]
This one you'd be embarrassed.

[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.680]
You'll make you feel better though just to prove it's not just America.

[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.500]
Where's the headline?

[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.100]
Here it is.

[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.580]
A huge huge picture.

[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.780]
We're a makes golf history.

[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.960]
Ah, that feels good.

[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.500]
Here's a big picture because it's Canada's first man to take a major golf tournament.

[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.080]
Mike Weir.

[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.660]
And here's Tiger was putting the green jacket at the Masters on Mike Weir.

[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.840]
That that's the front page story on the right wing national post.

[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.220]
Great.

[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.260]
Is that pathetic?

[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.980]
Yesterday I get a call here from Rimmer.

[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.840]
You're a good post best personal friend.

[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.540]
Uh huh.

[00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:00.480]
He says oh and wears on the 17th and there's he's giving me a play by play on golf boy that phone hit the cradle so fast.

[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.000]
So what are you doing?

[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.120]
What is wrong with you man?

[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.520]
Golf.

[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.540]
He came here to get away from people like you and then the front page of the national post it as much got a golf picture on the front page.

[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.440]
Oh, but it's a Canadian a who gives a crap it's golf.

[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.860]
God if there's one thing I'm going to go out of crusade to eliminate golf.

[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.760]
I'm going to make it illegal.

[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.600]
If they can make smoking and everything else illegal which we got a great smoking story by the way you see that story.

[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:23.900]
No.

[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.500]
I fact it to you but of course you're not paying any attention.

[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:34.700]
Bouncer fake bouncer fatally stabbed in Brawl of a New York City smoking van in a man head and my club will get to that and lots of other good stuff.

[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.240]
First the poll from over the weekend which we had a spectacular response.

[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.780]
In fact my ego is growing by the second because we had 1933 votes.

[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.120]
That could be a record at least in the post alien era.

[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.680]
Don't you think?

[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.040]
At least.

[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.200]
Once the last time we had 2000 votes on a poll on this show I remember a weekend once having 2000 votes.

[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.640]
That is spectacular 1933.

[00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.520]
Well I downloaded it had 1917.

[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.480]
Who do you think has the biggest ego we asked and winning and I'll tell you more you're slipping baby.

[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:11.540]
If that piece on your head slips as much as your effect on a poll as you're going to be in big big ass trouble and speaking of big ass.

[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.480]
This large ass limbo wins the biggest ego 379 votes.

[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.900]
Mohauer David a very respectable second gave a run for his money 349.

[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.480]
I guess they don't know Moe like we know.

[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.420]
No Moe.

[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:32.280]
George W 172 and then yours truly Neil Rogers 121 which I find most amusing but I guess you know a lot of people want to take a shot now because I'm unpatriotic.

[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.560]
I'm a left wing comedy liberal a pinko bastard fat whatever you know that's okay.

[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:42.820]
That's why we put it on there 121 which is amusing to me since I have no ego haven't worked on your 27 and a half years in Miami.

[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:53.240]
Howard Stern 108 Donald Rumsfeld 107 here I'm giving Rumsfeld Jr. 107 the Humper 73 by the way who did not stop into talk hockey with me at all.

[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.240]
I think I feel wounded.

[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.760]
You missed your big opportunity Humper.

[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.780]
What did I tell you about the Bruins no chance they're going to go for now.

[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.240]
How about those oilers huh?

[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.480]
How about the mighty duck?

[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.860]
I'm going to try and marry mighty duck.

[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.020]
I'll try some hockey George.

[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:17.720]
I'll hold the referral 67 Bill O'Reilly 61 Steve Mr. Ego Cain 52 he wouldn't done a lot better but all his audience voted all twice 52 votes.

[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.180]
George had 45 including the vote from his daughter.

[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.320]
Well that's embarrassing.

[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.100]
She knows.

[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.940]
Yeah big ego or pop a sass.

[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.020]
Nice going Sabrina.

[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.460]
Donald Trump 44 Jennifer Lopez 39.

[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.280]
Boy her ego was as big as her.

[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:35.680]
Raccoon.

[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.780]
Yeah she'd really done good.

[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.220]
Rick Snatches an Oprah time with 38 see a lot in common air.

[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:48.600]
Talking about big ass Larry King 31 Alex Penga Pakenka 26 OJ 25 Rick Riley 24 cast her over 23.

[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.360]
Let me say it again cast her over 23 and I wonder why I said it again.

[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:52.720]
What?

[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.460]
Because he likes repeating everything twice.

[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.460]
Whatever we do.

[00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:02.800]
Mike Wayne Hypinga and Martha Stewart tied 21 they both have a lovely do Jim Roman Madonna tied with 17 Phil Henry only had 11.

[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:08.240]
Are you sure Richard Pearl for an emerald a Gassy for I guess these people have never seen Richard Pearl huh?

[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.860]
The way he talks down his nose at everybody that arrogance sneering.

[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.100]
Oh man they don't even know who that is.

[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.500]
They would know Richard Pearl from Pearl Bailey a bet.

[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.620]
How is it possible there's so many stupid people out there.

[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.360]
Why really stop and think about that devolution.

[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:31.320]
Why do I examine that all and I'm talking about in America how come it's so so many stupid stupid stupid people we made it too easy.

[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.280]
Father's the crap I mean I don't know too much but I feel like a genius when I'm in America maybe that's why.

[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.000]
Come here and I feel like really I'm serious.

[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.800]
It's 11 past nine we got a big big fat line up today.

[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:51.000]
We're going to take a whole bunch of calls on issue and then the mad dog is back from Detroit and Augusta with a big fat red nose.

[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.540]
He looked like sandy claws.

[00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:00.820]
Really I mean he was right in the post and he admitted he'd had a few thousand green lizards and yellow ones and purple ones and red ones.

[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.200]
Those were the pills.

[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:08.020]
Jim Mandage 1 to 3 to Hump or my good close friend who did not stop by the semi last week and I feel really wounded.

[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.340]
Yeah sometimes that's the way you you know you work your way in with you get a little taste first and then you die I've had long in.

[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:50.140]
Huh? That's not a bad idea you just a little taste to give you little teas in the beginning and then when you're good and ready you die right on in.

[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.880]
Like sticking your toe in the swimming pool you know see if the water's warm.

[00:11:53.640 --> 00:12:03.000]
It turns out to be real nice and toasty and then you know sit around for one and you jump right in anyway speaking of jumping right in I had a call at home from fat boy on Friday who wants that food from balance for life.

[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.280]
Here's the answer for you in a short no that's it.

[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:13.160]
No we're not giving you the beast food and stop try to dance on the beast great fat boy we already tried that game with fat boy did it work now.

[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:21.520]

[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:28.480]

No cooking no shopping no cleaning by the way to doctor Bob I hang on over the weekend you know he's in a coma.

[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:57.840]

[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:22.020]

[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.940]

While Peter I'm that drives him up the tree.

[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:48.040]

[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.440]
You should watch last.

[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.480]
Well he's so smooth.

[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.720]
He puts me in a trace.

[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.820]
He makes me feel funny in my pants.

[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.340]
Don't give me wrong.

[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.420]
I'm not gay but I'll tell you.

[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.480]

[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.620]
Just me a lester holds.

[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.000]
Champagne on ice and double like the dead boat.

[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.540]
Here's our first call of a great new week from Miami.

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.920]
Hello.

[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.960]
Good morning Neil.

[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.000]
Yes sir.

[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.920]
George get back on that inner tube.

[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.180]
Get the hell out of town.

[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.360]
Bring that being a boy.

[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.240]
Okay there's a vote for being a boy.

[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:39.460]
They hate you George.

[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.220]
I don't know what it is.

[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.200]
Oh you didn't do all that good on the ego pull.

[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.580]
What's the pull we did last week Carlos where George didn't win but he came and did he win out?

[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.320]
What was that pull?

[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.580]
It was some kind of a negative hateful hostel.

[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:53.540]
What was that?

[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.700]
Oh that's right.

[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.620]
No he did win.

[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.680]
What sends you to the dial to change the station of fastest.

[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.180]
All right.

[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.100]
Golf talk.

[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.760]
Hockey talk.

[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.020]
George's voice.

[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.880]
I mean we had a lot of good choices on him.

[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.380]
I think you want hands down your pants.

[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:08.900]
All right.

[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.940]
The side of George's voice sends them diving into the dial.

[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:12.720]
I'll shut up then.

[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.520]
No don't shut up.

[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.180]
Just I'll let you know what to shut up.

[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:16.600]
All right.

[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:17.360]
Shut up.

[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.920]
5, 6, 7, or C.

[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:20.960]
Eric's not wasting any time.

[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.620]
I'll tell you Carlos has got him on the ball man.

[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.640]
The heavy duty competition now that the beater boys doing such a great job with our website.

[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.320]
He didn't waste any time getting up this new pool this morning.

[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.540]
It's on over 11 votes already.

[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.660]
Can you believe that?

[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.140]
We haven't even announced it yet.

[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.140]
It's already got 11 votes.

[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:37.500]
I voted.

[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.880]
Which of these things will you remember the most about the...

[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.240]
What we before we get to that?

[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.460]
See I got too much stuff on my plate.

[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.860]
You know that's like fat boys problem.

[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:47.740]
Too much stuff on his plate.

[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.120]
That's why he removes it and shows it all around his fat push.

[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.880]
You make me sick fat boy and don't you ever call me again at home you idiot?

[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.080]
What a moron.

[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.180]
Hey paly can I have that foot?

[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:57.440]
No.

[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:57.580]
No.

[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.000]
I don't care if the beast balloons up to 600 pounds.

[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.640]
We're not feeding you.

[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.160]
We already try.

[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.480]
See if we wouldn't have tried it once.

[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.040]
I'd say oh well something to think about.

[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:06.840]
Why not?

[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:07.960]
But we tried it once.

[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.080]
And he'd only ate all the food.

[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.600]
He was even eating the plastic containers that the food comes in.

[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.100]
And the black sack.

[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.100]
Said hey fat boy where's your black sack?

[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:17.740]
Oh aint it.

[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.480]
Aint it paly.

[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.320]
Eat this you jackass.

[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.180]
But anyway not only little evil was a great obscure record artist.

[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.420]
But the other one that immediately came to my mind was somebody who they named a pancake house.

[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.220]
After international.

[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.940]
No yeah any international.

[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.620]
Carl Perkins.

[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.780]
Oh yeah international.

[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.580]
Well I think I was right shut up George.

[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.020]
Which of these things will you remember the most about this arachitech we asked?

[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.580]
I've got I think eight great choices on there.

[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.780]
Turing down the statues of Sodom which we have a story on our website today which we'll eventually talk about.

[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.120]
That that was a staged photo opportunity.

[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.020]
No.

[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.620]
And didn't I make the comment at the time of Beater Boy that it didn't look like there was too many people there?

[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:00.280]
Yep.

[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.060]
Well they show the aerial photo and there's like there's nobody there really.

[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.200]
There's a handful of people.

[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.100]
Well they were scared.

[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.400]
Oh is that it?

[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:07.560]
Yeah.

[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.480]
No they were busy looting.

[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.220]
Turing down the statues of Sodom.

[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.480]
Rescue the POWs.

[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.160]
Let's hear it we got those seven POWs.

[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.140]
Which all of us are very thrilled about that.

[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.540]
Another great photo out for the president.

[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.200]
But nevertheless we're happy about that.

[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.140]
The looting and the chaos.

[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.240]
The thousands of dead and wounded people.

[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.280]
The great job by our military.

[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.680]
The biased reporting cheerleading by our media.

[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.740]
The Iraqi Information Minister's Daily Comedy.

[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.760]
I'll tell you one thing you won't be missing them for long.

[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.000]
The rumor around the station is he's replacing mode learning show the Iraqi Information Minister.

[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.800]
Would you think that's a great idea?

[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:40.180]

[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.440]
Oh we get a number.

[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:46.700]
More humor in the first 30 seconds than most had in over a year now except for the piece in which you can't see on a radio.

[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.220]
If we had like a webcam for the most show that would put them over the top.

[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.280]
I know it's a peer everybody in town with who didn't just to see what the which piece he was wearing and how it was hanging on that day.

[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.600]
How's it hanging Mo right over my left here?

[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.380]
The Iraqi Information Minister's Daily Comedy or the Sodom Doubles doing photo ops?

[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.480]
Like the Chubby Clown right?

[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:04.940]
Sodom.

[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.820]
That was out there meeting and greeting in the kiss and little babies the ones who were still alive.

[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.380]
So there you go there's our pool for the week.

[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.500]
I hope that nobody was grossed out by those pictures that Carlos put on our website.

[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.720]
I begged him please don't put that on there but he went ahead and did it anyway.

[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:26.380]
Didn't I beg you put I mean no people needed to see that stuff as grotesque and horrible as it was because the mainstream media aren't showing you that.

[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.680]
That's really what we're all about.

[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:28.440]
Not just this word.

[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.060]
Yeah that's right.

[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:36.360]
We don't want you to see that we just want to see the operation Iraqi freedom that was so well planned out.

[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.120]
I don't want to get started.

[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.460]
Here's our other call it's from Boka hello.

[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.840]
Good morning.

[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:43.820]
Yes sir.

[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.400]
Paul you've podcasted and I was filling your material today.

[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.400]
Yeah.

[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.620]
How are you usual about the biggest penis in Hollywood?

[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.400]
And that's right.

[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.460]
Don't you have a song that's called a human Jones?

[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.680]
Oh brother should I waste any time are they are they wasting any time?

[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:02.900]
No.

[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.040]
Thanks a lot Reverend Jones nice hearing from you.

[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.760]
He's okay I like him.

[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.000]
I hate to admit it but I mean some chronic's you.

[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.460]
Oh speaking of chronic's don't send me any faxes from any chronic Schmidt can't immediately.

[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.080]
Okay we'll not be mentioning their names ever again on the show.

[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.100]
Already done.

[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:18.340]
A lot.

[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:18.620]
Really?

[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.000]
Yeah.

[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:22.640]
Alright.

[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.220]
Wow.

[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.000]
The pressure got greater and greater.

[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:26.860]
We were starting to get there.

[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.020]
Those people need some serious serious assistance.

[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.980]
Not that I needed to tell you because you wouldn't have known whether I was there or not.

[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:35.680]
But I'm not there.

[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.360]
I'm in T.O.

[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.340]
And I'm very happy about it.

[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:41.280]
And it's blue skies in a beautiful day coming up here and I got the window open and it's just great.

[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.560]
Got a little that SARS virus coming in the window.

[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:43.880]
Yeah.

[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.160]
But uh...

[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:51.060]
So whatever there's no sense in wasting it because George isn't going to relay those faxes to me anyway.

[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.440]
And they'll never even see I won't even glimpse the writing so I can Schmidt can't at myself personal.

[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.280]
So wasting one sheet of paper is bad enough.

[00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.500]
Yeah but wasting a pair.

[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.900]
So I told Miguel I said what a waste of a pair he ran out of there.

[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.220]
Hey Miguel George is really pissed off of you.

[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.620]
There's going to be a skat fight in the hallways when I'm here.

[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.720]
I got the bus.

[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.900]
So he just kind of pulled a little...

[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.580]
I don't know what happened.

[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.640]
I know that he knew and he went out and he left like he was going to go do something about it.

[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.780]
But I thought it was going to be...

[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:18.960]
He did something obviously.

[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:19.380]

[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:19.920]

[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:26.720]
You were going to be gone and so he scanned the appearance of the 300 bucks from Treasure Island and also probably got something there too.

[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.180]
His girlfriend might listen all the way down it.

[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.720]
He's probably got her tied up in a conference somewhere.

[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.680]
If you don't say.

[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.780]
68 holds already which I just sat down here.

[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.400]
Do I have to admit that my clocks were wrong?

[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.960]
I got up this morning thinking it was 610 and it was 710?

[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:43.620]
Oh well...

[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.200]
Well 610 is bad because that's WIOD's 610.

[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.980]
It cannot be 610 anywhere that I am.

[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.300]
It was 710 because I forgot to set the clock set when I got here yesterday.

[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:56.220]
By the way, hi to Helen and Alene and all my good friends at Air Canada.

[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.520]
I had to change my clothes three times.

[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.160]
They peed over me so much yesterday in the airport.

[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.800]
Which of these things are remember most about this or racquetack?

[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.340]
The biased reporting that cheerleading by our media, 23.

[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.440]
I was speaking of our media here at CBC.

[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.680]
This giant Roger.

[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.420]
See, even if she's talking about me already.

[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.880]
The Iraq Information Minister is daily comedy 13.

[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.680]
That was special.

[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.040]
Yeah.

[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.200]
The thousands of dead and wounded people, 10 which was also special in a sick way,

[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.120]
tearing down the statues of Sodom 9, those great photo ops,

[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.360]
especially that one in particular in the middle of Baghdad.

[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.180]
I did a play by plan that last week where you were gone.

[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:32.500]
Yeah.

[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.320]
It was great.

[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.120]
I should have.

[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.420]
Great job by our military 8th.

[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:41.320]
The looting in chaos to the rescue of the POWs and Sodom devil's doing photo ops 1.

[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.880]
Come on, the clown deserves better net.

[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.740]
The clown Sodom, he was almost as funny as the Iraqi Information Minister.

[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.420]
He was a hoot.

[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.920]
But that big smile on his face is the real happy, girl lucky guy.

[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.160]
Oh yeah, this is Sodom really.

[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.140]
Anybody believe it?

[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:54.240]
No.

[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.340]
No, but he's a funny guy.

[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.340]
They're going to shoot me.

[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:56.680]
Yeah.

[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:57.840]
Yeah.

[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.080]
He's just not there in the open.

[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.660]
You see the clouds in the background, a cloud of smoke in the dust in the world, Bernie?

[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:04.200]
Yeah.

[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.380]
He's just a friendly kind of guy.

[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.620]
By the way, remember the Savak and the Shaw River ran.

[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.960]
Somebody mentioned that to me yesterday in the airport I was chatting with.

[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:12.500]
Right.

[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:18.060]
The Shaw River ran, which of course the public overthrew him because he was everybody's better Sodom.

[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.760]
And then they got the Ayatollah there and then we had to get Sodom in there to fight the Ayatollah.

[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.880]
And Alakwins led to.

[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.520]
And by the way, you Syrians, you're next.

[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:25.020]
Yeah.

[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.260]
We're going to get your ass.

[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.120]
See, this is really the search for weapons of mass destruction.

[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:29.920]
We're going to keep looking.

[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.760]
We're going to tumble country after country until we can find some.

[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.840]
927 at 560 WQM.

[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.580]
I'll tell you if you're on a search for some real bargains, I'll tell you where to find them.

[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.800]
The bargains are at the Swap Shop with over 88 acres chock full of bargains from indoor and outdoor vendors.

And at night, the Swap Shop has the world's biggest 13 screen drive and movie theater featuring great first run movies.

[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.440]
A lot of so many people shop at the Swap Shop.

[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.760]
You might ask, well, I'll tell you why.

My and local.

[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.260]
This is Fort Real 5 City.

[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.420]
You ain't too am.

[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.220]
I am. I'm low-grief.

[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.160]
I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.

[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.580]
Just sit quite back and you'll hear the tail of Peter Arnett.

[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.900]
The fumble in report is set us to pedesting yet.

[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.040]
He goes on I-Racky TV and talks out of his butt.

[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.940]
Now he can work the drive through and the bag that pizza.

[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.440]
Do I have this big mouth truck?

[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.060]
NBC has heard enough.

[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.840]
They can't visit yet.

[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.120]
People seem no one in bed and roasted on a spit.

[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.220]
The Senate had a fit.

[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:25.220]
Peter Arnett's just another big mouth with a mic like the pixie chicks and Martin Sheen.

[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.180]
Tim Robbins and his wife.

[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.120]
Oh, good.

[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:38.120]
Those movie stars, the professor and Columbia, they should get alive.

[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:43.160]
Next thing we'll see Peter with a turban on his head.

[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.360]
Hanging with Saddam Hussein and the U.S. Sarklamet.

[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.380]
Peter says he'll disappear to an island far away.

[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.720]
We should drill holes in his boat so our not has to stay.

[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.900]
The folks at a miss and BC have finally had enough.

[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.160]
I guess they're sick of his anti-American stuff.

[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.520]
I won't miss his comb over or his off yellow teeth.

[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:12.400]
He sounded like he was learning cocaine with the athlete.

[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.000]
It's a 9-33-560 WQAM.

[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.120]
Look what's winning on a pool.

[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:17.800]
The bias reporting.

[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:25.380]
I wonder how come on the American network we didn't have very much at all about the fact that 90% for the first several days after like 2-3 Wednesday last week.

[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.360]
The first several days after that with all the looting and the chaos that was going on.

[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.600]
Or as Don Rumsfeld said, the untightiness after the war, the untightiness.

[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.580]
Oh my god.

[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:35.660]
What a pile of crap.

[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.100]
Yeah.

[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.400]
The untightiness.

[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.720]
Does he got away with words or why?

[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:48.540]
But the fact of the matter is 90% of the hospital workers, well first of all they were looting the hospitals and taking out the macfaces and anything else they get their hands on.

[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:53.100]
But 90% of the hospital workers were afraid to show up for work because they were afraid to leave their homes.

[00:26:53.780 --> 00:27:00.580]
They were staying home because anybody who left their house when all that hysteria was going on, they'd come home to an empty house if it was still standing.

[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.540]
How do you like that?

[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:03.240]
Yeah.

[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:08.020]
So obviously the planning was really very thorough and very good in terms of what we would do once we got there.

[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.180]
And just like how mid cars are said in Afghanistan, you wait, you'll see the same thing there.

[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.660]
We hope not, but I have a feeling.

[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.520]
He might have his thumb on it.

[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:21.760]
Here's the facts from Shabir in Miami who says there is no meaning to shock and awe in Iraq.

[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:30.120]
Bush administration especially, DR Donald Rumsfeld and his neocons in the Pentagon have given new phrase winning the hearts and minds of Arabs and Muslims with shock and awe.

[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:39.340]
First we bombarded them and killed untold numbers of civilians and as soon as they occupied Iraq then they decided to send Franklin Graham for good Friday services for our troops.

[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.460]
Oh, we were that.

[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.080]
No, I wasn't.

[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:42.820]
Billy Graham's son.

[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:48.500]
This is the same Franklin Graham who called Islam an evil religion used all kinds of derogatory words for the prophet Mohammed.

[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.840]
He ought to be given a real war muckum over there, I'm sure.

[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:51.240]
What's that?

[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:51.880]
Yeah.

[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:52.840]
Woman fuzzy.

[00:27:52.840 --> 00:28:01.360]
The Pentagon's even considering allowing Franklin Graham ministry to take humanitarian aid to the people of Iraq and provide more evangelical gospel mixed with a few morsels of rice and wheat.

[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.880]
Matter of fact, speaking of Richard Pearl, the CDC last night showed one of the interviews that a couple weeks ago with him.

[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.420]
And he was talking about the new world order and about how they asked him.

[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.940]
They said, well, what about he's talking about exporting American values all over the world.

[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:17.220]
They said, well, what about the two thirds of the world that doesn't share American values?

[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:22.480]
He said, well, we either have to keep our distance or hope that in time we can bring them around to sharing our values.

[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.520]
Well, what is that?

[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:25.680]
We have days.

[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.780]
Yeah, we have days of making you share our values, whether you want to or not.

[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.480]
Anyway, it goes on, Shabir Spaks says, this is what we call the modern history.

[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.820]
How to win hearts and minds with shock and awe.

[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.280]
Arabs and Muslims are shocked in the air says awe.

[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.080]
Aw, shock.

[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:40.100]
Thank you, Shabir.

[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.140]
Good facts. Excellent.

[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.000]
And that's the presence of aw, shocks.

[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.220]
Who is not coming here by the way he's pissed off.

[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:49.700]
Damn.

[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:51.740]
Fucking you.

[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.400]
Oh, yeah, that's the whole photo clown him in the Dick Fiber.

[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.240]
You're not fooling anybody.

[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.060]
Jerry Fogel.

[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.740]
Jerry Fogel from WBBF, I do believe.

[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:00.960]
One of the busy bees.

[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.060]
Who would have busy bees on WBBF and Rochester, George?

[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:04.440]
Come on.

[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.260]
Jo Dean.

[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:06.600]
Jerry Fogel.

[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.820]
I think it was Vogel.

[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:08.760]
I don't know what his name is.

[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.060]
Joy Reynolds.

[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.320]
There was always Eddie Meehthaw in the WHEC.

[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.140]
He's dead from candidate when the York.

[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.680]
Let's do some upstate the York trivia.

[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:14.940]
No.

[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.380]
No, because only Dick Fienberg will be listening.

[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:16.860]
We can't do it.

[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:17.480]
We have no diaries.

[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.420]
It's just thanks for the little eve of trivia.

[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:19.960]
No problem.

[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:20.300]
Dick.

[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.620]
And by the way, give a big statue.

[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.460]
He's speaking of statues.

[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:23.740]
He's falling.

[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.520]
Give a big statue.

[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.740]
A gold star in a purple jelly bean.

[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.000]
The Brian Sears on the way out of town.

[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.020]
What a great job again, Brian.

[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:29.520]
You're the best.

[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.400]
You are the best.

[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.140]
Everybody's the best at what they do.

[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:32.620]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:33.520]
There's in every category.

[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.600]
There's someone who's the best.

[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.680]
And when it comes to driving a horse,

[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.060]
there ain't nobody like Brian Sears.

[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.780]

Hey, Moose, what's weather forecast for today?

947-560-WQM.

[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.560]
Here's a lady in plantation.

[00:35:58.900 --> 00:35:59.020]
Hello.

[00:35:59.620 --> 00:35:59.800]
Hello.

[00:35:59.800 --> 00:35:59.900]
Hi.

[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.820]
I'm not on the turnpike now.

[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:02.700]

[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.120]
Here's a lady on the turnpike.

[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.100]
Hi.

[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:05.260]
What's up?

[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.580]
I said, how you doing?

[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:06.660]
I'm fine.

[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.740]
Oh, pretty good.

[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.240]
But I'm really pissed off about something.

[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.400]
About what?

[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.200]
About the situation in Iraq.

[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.000]
Specifically, that the river seems to care.

[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:22.760]
You know, I could be wrong about this because I am a product of the Rourke County School System.

[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:29.160]
But I do believe I learned in school that it takes two thirds of an act of Congress to start a war.

[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.120]
I miss something and it happened and I miss it.

[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.100]
No, you missed the Democrats rolling over and playing dead.

[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.020]
That's what you missed.

[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.580]
I'm just really pissed off about this.

[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.560]
I'm pissed off that we're going to use all our resources in this war.

[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.640]
And then when we keep on fighting everybody, we're going to be depleted.

[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.040]
Look at Curry's problem.

[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:49.660]
Same time.

[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:56.120]
By the way, is this the same military that they told us that Clinton had just a totally emasculated

[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.560]
and taken away all of the things that they needed and didn't fund the military?

[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.480]
Is this the same one that they inherited that did just a wonderful job?

[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.940]
That very same one, yes.

[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.360]
So I'm really angry about this, that nobody seems to care.

[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.060]
Nobody's talking about it.

[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.200]
No, not only that.

[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:14.320]
It's not just that they don't care, but if you don't agree with the company line, it makes you a bad person.

[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.500]
That's what pisses me off the most.

[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:19.320]
If you're not out there waving a flag and agreeing with the goose stepping,

[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.600]
well, we have to support our commander-in-chief or in war, but that's a bunch of bull crap.

[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.880]
Exactly. That's a whole bunch of crap.

[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:32.460]
You can have an opinion and not agree with these things and still be an American.

[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:33.180]
Right.

[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:38.240]
But I guess these must be all a bunch of punks or people with Alzheimer's because they forget Vietnam,

[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.100]
if it wouldn't have been for public opinion, we'd probably still be in there.

[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.560]
Oh, the King's God.

[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.540]
Thank you for letting me bend.

[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:45.380]
Hang in there.

[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.440]
Thank you, Sue.

[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.380]
Good luck. I'm hanging. Watch that driving down there. That's another thing I don't miss driving.

[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.560]
You people who are driving most of you, I've always said this and it's true.

[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.600]
It's just like they said, I'm impersonator. It's the same thing.

[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.080]
We got a whole bunch of people in South Florida impersonating drivers.

[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.280]
It didn't take me long to get back into my mood.

[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.340]
Oh, God.

[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.380]
I can't deal with it. I'm sorry. I've never seen such crap.

[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.820]
And every time I get back home, it's worse. It's madness.

[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.920]
Did I say get back home? Like I said, I'm out of my back home.

[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:17.160]
As a matter of fact, I'm glad that he called with that because here's one of the great stories

[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.520]
in the Sun Sentinel yesterday.

[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.320]
Today is a matter of fact. This morning, I'm on top of it.

[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:26.040]
Resident show patriotism by relaying flag from Wellington to Miami-Dade County.

[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.420]
Yeah. That shows your patriotism.

[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.560]
Oh, God. I'm so I want to puke. I want to vomit.

[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:34.660]
I want to just like Linda Blair puke up piece soup for about 20 hours.

[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.500]
Get out of my system.

[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.140]
That's what makes you pay for your out of kids.

[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:42.380]
It's just like I said. You know, see the interesting thing is after 9-11,

[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:48.500]
the majority of people, I think I'm right in saying that the majority of people

[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:53.460]
found some way whether it was putting a flag in front of their house or putting some kind of a thing under a car.

[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.700]
They displayed real patriotism because the country had been attacked.

[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:58.240]

[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.320]
We felt that all of us as Americans were under attack.

[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:06.460]
There was very little debate about that. Not too many people said, well, you know, this had nothing to do with me.

[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:11.600]
But now you'll notice you'll see flags on cars like maybe one out of here, maybe a hundred.

[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.400]
Maybe, right? Right? Sure.

[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.100]
Even where I was in the deep sale.

[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.460]
Yeah. And the reason for that being that we have, we're not under attack.

[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.340]
Iraq wasn't going to attack us. They were going to attack Britain.

[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.260]
We went in and we attacked them.

[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.200]
We went in and we invaded another country.

[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:34.640]
And this idea, just like Craig Chances, this is the whole thing of regime change, is crazy.

[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.800]
He says, today it's Iraq, who's it going to be tomorrow?

[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.260]
Syria. I'm sorry. Who's it going to be? And after that, regime change, which is just going for going in there and overthrowing governments.

[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.160]
I'll tell you, you want to do a real good one.

[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:51.420]
Let's make a stop over. It's real close to Syria. It's right next door. Let's make a stop over in Israel and give it a very else your own.

[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.040]
Sounds good to me. Yeah. For pay soft. Let's do it.

[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:02.280]
Put somebody moderate in there. Now, she wants to say, well, he's willing to sit down and they're going to, well, you know, start doing the really hard, painful things and get all those settlements.

[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.780]
I'll believe it when I see it. Okay.

[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.460]
I believe it when those draodles of Hanukkah time turned into a hundred dollar bills.

[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:19.420]
Anyway, it wasn't the red, white and blue human shame they hoped for, but some software to residents showed their patriots as yesterday by relaying a flag from Wellington to date County. Aren't you thrilled with that?

[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:25.920]
I feel so freaking American, man. Come on. Let's play something patriotic.

[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.160]
Oh, Canada. Come on. Cut it out.

[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:36.040]
Several dozen people from Palm Beach and Broward counties participated in a flag relay to show the support for the troops in Iraq.

[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:44.760]
The original idea, the original idea was thousands of people standing side by each, passing a flag to each other along US 441. It fell short.

[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:50.500]
Yeah, they couldn't find enough people, but organizers pushed the understatement of the century, but organizers pushed it anyway.

[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.920]
They decided to make it a relay walk with one group of participants handing the flag off to others who were waiting.

[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:02.760]
They carried an American flag for 50 miles along the road, starting at the mall in Wellington, green on 4th till Boulevard 8 a.m.

[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:09.520]
It was one of two pro troop events Sunday in Palm Beach County at John print. Oh, geez. What happened?

[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:16.080]
I just filled a little bit of soda. Okay. I got a little carried away. Just a little bit. Not a whole bunch like that one time.

[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:21.300]
At John Prince Park and Lake Worth, crowds turned out to your local bands at the Papierta team freedom fest.

[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:26.960]
Wellington resident Michelle Shaw conceived a flag really about two weeks ago. We didn't work there, Michelle.

[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.780]
You spent your time more usefully going out there and visiting some sick people in the hospital.

[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:41.620]
Raising some money for underprivileged kids. Right? Yeah. Oh, sorry. I was just frustrated watching the news.

[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:47.780]
Here is here is the line. Okay. This is what really caught my attention. This is America for you.

[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:56.060]
I was just frustrated watching the news. There were so many anti-war protests. Shaw said horns have been honking all over the place. This means a lot to us.

[00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:05.180]
There's so many people who don't get it. You don't understand what freedom of speech is all about. You don't understand about legitimate protest. You don't get it at all.

[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:15.300]
Just go stepping and going along with whatever the government says is not being a good American. It's not being a good citizen. It's not being a thoughtful human being. It's being a sheep. That's all you're being is a sheep.

[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:20.720]
Every time the country does something we're supposed to say, yeah, USA. You know, mindless idiots.

[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:29.680]
And it goes on about to this one said this and that one said that and our troops are fighting so we can have a, oh, look at this. Look at this.

[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:37.220]
Our troops are fighting so that we can have the freedom to do what we're doing right now said, trust sister, Lori Greenberg 32 of all Indian.

[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:45.920]
I think our troops were fighting supposedly if really that was what they were supposed to be for for the freedom to not only do your march, but all the other protestors that you're lamenting so badly too.

[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.180]
As the cab brought me to my place here yesterday from the airport. Yeah.

[00:42:52.780 --> 00:43:05.180]
Coming past the US consulate over on University Avenue. There were a pro war protests. There were a bunch of Iraqi and a few other people and they were waving American flag inside. You know how many there were?

[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:07.120]
About 30 minutes.

[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:16.200]
And you know something that's about right. That's about an accurate count. Start unseen by you. That's about right.

[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:29.140]
What are we talking about here? Have to keep excoriating everybody who doesn't agree with you at all. We're going to point out their movies and Martin Sheen. You're a son of a bitch and this one and Susan Sarandon.

[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:41.260]
We got a cancel that showing at the movie at the base ball hall of fame. I mean, other people really that stupid. Obviously they must be. They're buying into what are millions of more buying into what Chris millions of people voted for this.

[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.900]
And I think that's the first place. It's not a majority, but a whole lot of them did.

[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:59.380]
One thing I'm never ever going to do is apologize for the fact that on this show we sit here and you know, have it talk about balls. At least we got the balls even. And in the long run it's not going to help us. And long run we're going to pay a price for it. Too bad we don't care.

[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:07.620]
We just don't care. Those people want to get their arbitrage diaries if they want to punish us because we don't want to go step along. Have a good time. I don't care.

[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:16.640]
Somebody somewhere to need to be a few of us in this country and there are just a select few who got the balls and just like that Michael Moore column I read last week you were out, but it was great.

[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.340]
It was on our website.

[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:29.000]
But after the all at hoopla about his performance at the Oscars accepting his Academy Award, the sale of his book went skyrocketing went back to number one on the New York Times bestseller list.

[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:37.920]
About the Dixie to Dixie chicks actually the sale of their records their CD skyrocketed they went back on the top number four whatever was on the billboard company chart.

[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:53.940]
Good. So all of the see but again the media doesn't tell you that the media wants to convey the company line and that is that if you dare to step out and speak the opposing point of view if you won't go step in a line that you're going to pay a price for it. And that's not true. It's not true.

[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:58.060]
They're owned by the company so of course they're going to give the company line that is correct.

[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:06.060]
And this business would cheat channel radio and affect that the Michael Powell you know at the FCC they want to give them an opportunity to buy up more radio stations.

[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:15.920]
So you can have Russia and bond doctor Laura and Smith my strip and the same crap on every station in America and not have any choices left and hear the same right wing point of view 24 hours a day.

[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.860]
It's all every day yeah but at least you won't have to hear somebody say do do.

[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:35.100]
Oh I forgot about that now it's not do do you better get with it because you you didn't get the memo I told you a little bit this right but now you can't even say I predicted that they would come you can't say then you can't take one too close to show time so get it out of your system a little earlier from now on.

[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:35.380]
Ask.

[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:45.060]
See Carlos told you yeah be the boys get ready to sign a contract by the way for your job one one more ass and that's it.

[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:53.860]
And do not do that eating ass stuff in fact believe you me that you you've done the last show on that trust me when I tell you just beating ass from no one.

[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:57.960]
No see there go one more ass one more ass.

[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:58.620]
Where's that then.

[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:08.480]

Well there's a little BBC for you

[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.080]
Okay let's take a call from Boca, shall we?

[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.280]
Boca is pretty busy this morning

[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.260]

[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.120]

[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.420]
Oh god how boring

[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:05.460]
and that's a different one by the way

[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:08.300]
I think I'm not or the same maybe it's PD's boyfriend

[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:10.700]
Here's their comma rage hello

[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:11.800]
Hello

[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.680]
Yes sir

[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:17.740]
Hey Neil I'm calling about uh I read an article this morning about uh Donna Romfele

[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:18.340]
Yeah

[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:22.680]
In the news week and he was uh Tim Ruffada asked him about uh you know what

[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:27.400]
why they planning to go to Cuba next since the Castro murdered those guys for kids

[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.460]
I'm right, how jackass

[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:31.140]
And I was wondering what did these people think that uh

[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:35.440]
that's going on with this Bush administration as far as they don't care about people

[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.520]
they just care about old don't you think so?

[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.720]
Big business man all their buddies and big business

[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.560]
That's all there's about

[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.080]
I put it in a lot of time ago

[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.600]
OIL and M.O.N.Y.

[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.360]
and it's all they care about

[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.960]
As far as Romfele he's an asshole

[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:46.840]
That's for sure

[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:47.400]
I agree

[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:49.040]
Hang in there, Bill

[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:49.780]
Have a great day

[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.780]
Yeah you're not fooling anybody

[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.060]
You're fooling some people Rummy but not too many

[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.760]
A little untightiness after the war

[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:00.180]
And then at that very same press briefing

[00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:01.500]
he was foaming at the mouth

[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:02.160]
Did you see that one?

[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:02.780]
No

[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:05.940]
Where he was screaming it was USA today was the paper was referring to

[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.960]
He was holding it up and they had big headlines about the looting

[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.420]
Which of course is the only story because it was just total chaos

[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.520]
Which is what one of the headlines many of the headlines said

[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.740]
Total chaos and bagged that

[00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:14.500]
And he's a

[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:15.820]
Is this all they could find?

[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.020]
This is all they can find

[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:18.040]
And the meantime we've done this

[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:18.600]
So we've done that

[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.400]
Buh buh buh buh

[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.600]
And that's all they could find

[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:23.540]
I mean he is scary

[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.960]
He's like Joseph Gerbels and Hermann Gearing

[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.960]
And all these all rolled up into one

[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.760]
And last night the CBC showed the doctor

[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.800]
And he recommended me again about the background of how

[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.440]
Iraq came to be what it was

[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:37.080]
Right

[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.960]
And about how Reagan you know

[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:43.220]
Supposedly Saddam was the CIA's hand picked guy over there

[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:46.320]
To counteract the Ayatollah after they overthrew our good buddy

[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.260]
The Shah who we installed in the first place in Iran

[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:51.960]
And even after the gassing of the Kurds which they showed

[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.120]
And of course we told the Kurds

[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.420]
Just like we did the Hungarians

[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.120]
You got the revolt and you do this and we're going to come in and help you

[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.380]
Which of course we did not do

[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.440]
And so then he gassed thousands of his own people

[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:04.120]
And Reagan the aah, now hands off because it's our boy

[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:05.800]
That's our guy

[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:08.320]
And subsequent to that

[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:11.580]
Here was all this co-sing up including training and halibut

[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:14.120]
And people doing business with him is little is five years ago

[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:18.620]
Right in billion dollar contracts with the worst the most evil dictator on a face of the earth

[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.880]
How are people so stupid to believe this?

[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:24.460]
How is it possible to be that dumb even if you're trying?

[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.540]
Even little beater boy

[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.240]
Why they didn't get out of the third grade even he knows better than that

[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.360]
Second grade?

[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.440]
He wants a vote act

[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:38.700]
Restoring security here will take time and manpower

[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.480]
Restoring peace may be quicker

[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:46.240]
But there are still occasional fire fights like this one in the early hours of this morning

[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.960]
American troops open fire on diehard Iraqi resistance

[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:54.320]
And round up fighters said to be still loyal to Saddam Hussein

[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.240]
And you notice the Bushmaster yesterday

[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.020]
Do you see the comments about this Syria?

[00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:58.720]
Yeah

[00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.900]
This is the new deal

[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:05.060]
We're positive that they have chemical weapons and we're also positive that they've been helping out the Iraqis

[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:08.460]
And they've got some of the Iraqi scumbags of across the border in Yadi Yadiyaan

[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:09.520]
They're harboring them

[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:13.720]
And you'll also notice the top Iraqi scientist which we had seen him many times before

[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.560]
That turned himself in last the Friday

[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:18.240]
He said we don't have any weapons of mass destruction

[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:19.180]
Oh yes you do!

[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:20.180]
Oh no we don't

[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:22.220]
Now what would have been the reason for him to say that?

[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:25.860]
What motivation when he's already turned himself in

[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:26.240]
Right

[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.440]
And they're not going to do anything to him

[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:30.360]
I mean except interrogate him and beat him a little bit

[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:32.480]
Pull his fingernails out

[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:34.820]
But what would be the motivation to lie?

[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:36.580]
We don't have any weapons of mass destruction

[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:39.060]
Just general anti-Americanism

[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:40.500]
Oh here's picture now

[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.140]
He also lost his mother

[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.300]
And his younger brother

[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:48.720]
Now he is dying because his terrible wounds are infected

[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:49.200]
Oh

[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.620]
Ali has septicemia

[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:55.520]
He told me he'd like to be flown to London for specialist treatment

[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.860]
Soon as possible

[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:01.300]
That's a total of your boy that lost a lot of weapons that we have to be trained with

[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:04.640]
Without such help Ali could well be dead within the week

[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:09.520]
They would be more than 10000

[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:11.720]
Thousands and thousands of examples like that

[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:14.440]
And all the flag waivers out there

[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.700]
They have no opinion on this

[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:18.320]
And you'll notice by the way speaking of our illustrious brilliant president

[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.800]
Not once

[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.660]
Not once is he uttered one word

[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:28.160]
He's given all his sympathies to the relatives and the families of the American troops over there who were killed needlessly of course

[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:33.300]
And people like David Bloom and reporters who were killed including the ones in the Palestine hotel who were murdered

[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:38.800]
But not one word about the Iraqi civilians about the grotesque loss of life

[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.060]
Because there hasn't been any

[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:42.780]
No seriously I mean stop and think about it

[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:46.120]
What kind of insensitive prick are we talking about that is our president supposedly

[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.180]
Our commander in thief

[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:50.700]
He won't acknowledge it just like Reagan didn't acknowledge AIDS until you know

[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.920]
Oh, it's the unspeakable thing

[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:55.800]
Right right and of course you'll notice this story it's on the BBC a

[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.440]
Oh

[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.520]
Comey they just showed the images

[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.360]
This is the kind of thing and because in Vietnam if you recall

[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.620]
And finally not have been writing stories about this the last few days

[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:08.900]
In Vietnam when it really started to come and close to home is when we started seeing the pictures

[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:09.860]
Mm-hmm

[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:15.500]
Of the wounded naked children and the other mutilation of the innocent people the civilians piles of bodies

[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:19.580]
Right then it started to come on like this butchery going on over there

[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:26.680]
And we're the ones that are talking about genocide and about Castro is doing this to the to the dissidents down there

[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.700]
And he's three days just executed who the hell are we to talk

[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:35.380]
Like I said a couple of weeks ago the butcher of Baghdad was overthrown by the butcher of Washington

[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:36.920]
That's basically what it boils down to

[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:41.540]
And he's saying Syria is next not going to come and write out and say in that

[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:43.640]
But you have to be pretty stupid not to read between the lines

[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:47.220]
And what after that as Richard Brod

[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:50.200]
I used to laugh when I used to see this stuff about this new world order

[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.340]
I thought it was pretty good

[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:51.600]
Oh it was pretty good

[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.080]
That's what they got in mind that's what it's all about

[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.040]
They're going to reshape the map

[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:02.840]
And just like this business about Franklin Graham that was a great fast we had before because what a great example

[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.560]
They don't want to hear from Franklin Graham they don't believe that crap

[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:07.960]
We're kind of convert the whole world of Christianity

[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:12.920]
We're going to make our with the whole world our own business

[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.920]
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale hello

[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:19.200]
Neil

[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.140]
Yes sir

[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:25.680]
A couple of things I got your books that you talked about the blinded by the right

[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.680]
And I'm going to halfway through that one right now

[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:28.060]
Good

[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:30.680]
That is absolutely amazing

[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.020]
Yeah how they just made all this stuff about Clinton up

[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:34.200]
They just went ahead and made it up

[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:40.640]
And did you get the new edition now because there was a second printing I guess where he's got a new preface

[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:41.640]
Yes

[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:44.340]
Yeah and nobody's challenged him

[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.420]
And some of the comments that he attributes to people

[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:52.720]
I would think that they would just be screaming if they weren't true

[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:57.360]
Yeah they only commented that there was disputed was Matt the drudge speaking to the spirit

[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:01.820]
Yeah there's one more comment or something but I'm not even halfway through it

[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:03.500]
And I'm trying to pick my jaw off the floor

[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:08.140]
It's incredible but you know most of the public want they're not even going to read a newspaper much less a book

[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:13.360]
Oh yeah and try to explain or try to talk to somebody about facts

[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:17.980]
And I love the spin is now complete on this war

[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:23.800]
As I recall we were going for because they had weapons of mass destruction and they were an imminent terrorist threat

[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:28.600]
Ask anybody why we're there now and it's oh we're freeing the Iraqi people

[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.160]
Right the ones who are still alive

[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.220]
And you're right who's next?

[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:36.740]
They're making the same noises about Syria that they were making about Iraq

[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:37.640]
And Iran

[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.420]
And North Korea

[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:41.440]
Meanwhile the people who attacked them

[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:41.940]
And Connecticut

[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:47.260]
Yeah we're safe from little old ladies with nail files in their in their suitcases or something

[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:48.760]
Exactly now you're talking

[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.980]
It's a nation of sheep, nail

[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:53.940]
Hang in there Pally I'll see you I'll see you at the border

[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:54.880]
Yeah

[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:56.800]
Have a great day

[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.060]

And we have a poll question today on neo-roggers.com

[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:08.900]
Which of these things will you remember the most about the Iraq attack?

[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.000]
Of course we should have put one other selection on there

[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:11.800]
You know what it should have been?

[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:12.680]
What was that?

[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:13.640]
All of these things

[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.320]
Yeah just to be cute

[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:18.960]
The bias reporting cheerleading by the media 70

[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:20.460]
Very good

[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:35.200]

[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:37.480]
Linda says, is this really happening?

[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:38.880]
Am I living in the twilight zone?

[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.120]
Can somebody please pinch me so I can wake up from this nightmare?

[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.500]
Linda wants you to pinch your George.

[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.180]
All right, I'll be right over.

[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.160]
If Foch is reelected in 2004

[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.060]
and the spin is that he will

[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.860]
there won't be a pinch big enough in this world of wake

[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:48.880]
as all of them in this nightmare.

[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.420]
That is if the world is still here, Linda.

[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.700]
In 2004, that's a few months away yet.

[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:53.580]
Let's hope we make it.

[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.580]
It'll be here for the Christians.

[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:55.960]
Oh, that's right.

[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.940]
And those of us Jews who decide to them

[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.760]
accept the offer that we shouldn't refuse.

[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:01.680]
Jew and me.

[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.680]
In 50-60 minutes says this fact.

[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:04.420]
I did not say it.

[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:04.660]
Did you?

[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:05.520]
Did you?

[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:05.900]
No.

[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.860]
That propaganda expert, Bitch,

[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.560]
used car sales, Bitch was on their demanding

[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.600]
that we understand that the whole world was getting the truth

[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.980]
through the live play by play reporting.

[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:13.360]
Right.

[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.140]
Then for a few seconds, they went to a snippet saying that

[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:18.860]
other countries were showing the truth also by showing corpses

[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:19.620]
of small children.

[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.300]
Like the one I just saw moments ago, it wasn't a corpse.

[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.080]
But afraid it's going to be Ali, that 12-year-old boy.

[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:24.460]
Mm-hmm.

[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.700]
Wow, it looked for just a moment that we're going to confront her

[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.560]
with the real blood-spilling videos as being the truth.

[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.460]
But astonishingly, instead on 60 minutes,

[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:35.500]
they went to a piece about a female golfer playing against men

[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.240]
and how this will affect the world.

[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:37.680]
Oh.

[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:39.680]
Oh.

[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.420]
You know, the thing about while Roombard, Nero,

[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:44.480]
Fiddled and all that stuff.

[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:45.580]
That's what it's all about.

[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.260]
Front page of the right-wing national post.

[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.920]
The militaristic bush-looking national post up here.

[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.780]
Huge, huge full-color picture.

[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:55.080]
There is Tiger putting the green jacket on Canadian Mike Weir

[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:58.160]
who wins the Masters and Augusta at a golf tournament.

[01:02:59.340 --> 01:02:59.640]
Oh.

[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.740]
It's unspeakable as what it is.

[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.960]
The counts of Bakuba on the east side of the Tiger's River.

[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:07.820]
Bakuba.

[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:08.620]
Kuba.

[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:08.960]
Kuba.

[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:09.640]
We live Bakuba.

[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.240]
Kuba, right here.

[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:12.600]
How's that pool coming, Nero?

[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.580]
Glad you asked.

[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:18.020]
Which of these things do you remember most about the Iraq attack?

[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.260]
The biased reporting by a cheerleading by the media 79.

[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.400]
The Iraq Information Minister's Daily Comedy 48.

[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.080]
The thousands of dead and wounded people,

[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.780]
which obviously ought to be number 138.

[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.500]
But of course most of these people haven't seen that enough.

[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.480]
So it's just numbers on a page and not real.

[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.960]
The great job by our military 37.

[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.960]
Turing down the statues of Sodom 29.

[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.640]
The looting in chaos 12.

[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:44.040]
Rescue the POWs 5.

[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.600]
And the Sodom doubles doing a photo ops 3.

[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.780]
5 6 7 0 5 60, pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line.

[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:54.960]
Here's Poppano. Hello.

[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:56.260]
Hello.

[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:57.120]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.720]
Good morning, Neil. How you doing?

[01:03:59.060 --> 01:03:59.280]
Okay.

[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:04.280]
I was just flipping it yesterday and I happen to get kids' country

[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.400]
and they have a song written by this guy.

[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.640]
Have you forgotten?

[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.880]
And in the song he makes the connection that the World's Race Center

[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.640]
and Sodom are connected.

[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:17.880]
And it's just the sheep just follow along and follow along.

[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:18.860]
And follow along.

[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:19.200]
Right.

[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:26.460]
And did you happen to see the thing about Rajakhan not going up to the Hall of Fame?

[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:27.020]
Yes.

[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:30.720]
Yeah, Rajakhan was really pissed off that they refused to show the movie

[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.880]
because of Susan Sarandon and who was the other one Tim Robbins.

[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:40.580]
And the Rajakhan who courses a phenomenal sports writer.

[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:41.440]
He said, I'm not going.

[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:42.140]
He didn't go.

[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.280]
Good for him.

[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.440]
He's supposed to go in August and I have it right here just real quick.

[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:51.000]
By canceling the Hall of Fame anniversary celebration of bold arm

[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.340]
for political reasons, you are far from supporting our troops,

[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.980]
defying the noblest of the American spirit.

[01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:59.100]
You are choking freedom of dissent.

[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:00.120]
How ironic.

[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:04.300]
In theory, at least we had been fighting this war to give our rackeys freedom of dissent.

[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:07.220]
But here you, through the great institution you had,

[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:11.620]
have moved to Rob Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon and Ron Sheldon of that very freedom.

[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:12.040]
Right.

[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:16.960]
In support of the American right to dissent, I have no choice but to cancel my obvious speaking appearance of the Hall.

[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:21.300]
And he reminded this scumbag at the Hall of Fame who made the decision.

[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.400]
He was the assistant press secretary for Ronald Reagan.

[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.460]
Yeah, but people don't know that.

[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.200]
People don't care.

[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.620]
Negropon to you at the UN.

[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:30.720]
This one here, Elliott Avers back.

[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:31.480]
This one back.

[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.440]
And Americans have a late out of the fund room that they want to read.

[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:35.880]
But they all in some of them there.

[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:36.860]
Yes, they are.

[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:39.340]
Neil, how far is it to the border?

[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.620]
Not too far, man.

[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:42.600]
You can be here in a couple of hours.

[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:43.800]
Thank you.

[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:44.600]
Have a great day.

[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a AT&T.

[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.780]
I wonder what all those flag waivers.

[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.140]
I wonder what the people who were like marching from Wellington to a date, counties today.

[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.500]
I wonder what those people think when they see the images of the...

[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:05.400]
Of course, they're not seen too many because American TV is making very, very sure that we see a minimal if no of that footage.

[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.500]
You wonder what they think.

[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.060]
No, no, seriously.

[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.160]
What is their rationale when they see that?

[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.720]
Well, that's the collateral damage.

[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:12.840]
That's the price of freedom.

[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:13.380]
They think they're too late.

[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:13.800]
I'm sorry.

[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:14.800]
Excuse me.

[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.060]
That's the price of freedom.

[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.340]
That we decided to impose.

[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.500]
God, it's just sickening.

[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.440]
It's nauseating the butchering that we've committed.

[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:32.180]
And again, you know, peace together things that...

[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.940]
Pieces of a puzzle out of nothing to do with each other.

[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.000]
Just jam together.

[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.040]
Just jam that square peg of the round hole.

[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:41.360]
Like he says, oh, 9-11.

[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.200]
We can't forget that.

[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:43.400]
We don't forget 9-11.

[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.120]
What the hell is that?

[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.300]
We don't have to do with what we just got through a war in the business of doing right now.

[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:48.660]
What does one have to do with the other?

[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:49.660]
Absolutely nothing.

[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:50.600]
Zero.

[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:53.220]
They're all over there.

[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.120]
They're all Muslims.

[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:54.900]
They're all from over there.

[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:56.720]
Oh, I forgot.

[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:57.680]
Smatha heads.

[01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:57.940]
Right.

[01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.500]
Here's North Miami.

[01:06:59.520 --> 01:06:59.900]
Hello.

[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.060]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:01.660]
Okay.

[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:08.080]
I was flipping through the channels of the other day and the dentist half-stored, the speaker of the house.

[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:08.920]
Have you seen him lately?

[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:10.700]
Have I seen him lately?

[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:11.000]
Yeah.

[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.400]
Thankfully not.

[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:16.980]
He makes Tip O'Neill look like Peewee Herman.

[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:17.600]

[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:22.580]
But he had a yellow ribbon on his lapel that was so huge.

[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.320]
I mean, he doesn't support the troops.

[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.620]
He really, really supports the troops.

[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:27.360]
Yeah.

[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:27.820]
Oh, I know.

[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:30.600]
He's a lot more patriotic than the rest of us.

[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:30.840]
Right.

[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.300]
It is so huge.

[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:36.260]
He just looked ridiculous.

[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.140]
I want to know what's new about that.

[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:39.540]
Yeah.

[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:46.300]
Well, it's just, I don't know, the flag waving and the ribbons and it's just a bunch of symbolism.

[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.760]
Mindless idiots, man.

[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:48.540]
That's what you're dealing with.

[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:49.780]
The masses are mindless idiots.

[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:53.160]
Well, I'm an adult college student in North Miami.

[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:57.460]
And some of these kids, I swear to God, I mean, they're, we look what we did.

[01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:58.820]
Look what we did in Baghdad.

[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:01.260]
Look what we, but none of them, of course, are in the military.

[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.320]
They're all in college.

[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:06.340]
But they're just so brainwashed.

[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.260]
And it's just, I'm throwing my hands up in there.

[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.860]
I'm, I'm practically giving up between the establishment, the media and the government.

[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.780]
It's just, it's too much sometimes.

[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.540]
Just stick with the funny papers, man.

[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:17.280]
You'll be a lot happier.

[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.680]
Yeah, I got a request, Neil.

[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:19.160]
Yes, sir.

[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.660]
You still have that bit.

[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:25.160]
Well, either I hate the bird or Ambo.

[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:26.820]
Or what's the other one?

[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:27.840]
Ambo.

[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:29.500]
And remember, Ampigh has been...

[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.120]
Ambo, yeah.

[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:31.120]
Yeah, Rambo, Ambo.

[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.060]
You got him, man.

[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:32.760]
Oh, I think a lot.

[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.200]
See ya.

[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:33.960]
Good luck to you, pal.

[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:34.720]
You'll need it.

[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:35.440]
Good luck to you.

[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.640]
Don't let this affect your mind.

[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.840]
Okay, just keep pounding right straight forward.

[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:39.960]
Okay, like wood blinders on.

[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:41.240]
Just keep pounding straight ahead.

[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.180]
I'm not all the simple insists doing their juices.

[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:44.740]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.140]
No, what do you say?

[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:47.280]
Scrum.

[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:50.940]
1026 and 560 WQA.

[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.520]
I'm happy Monday from all your good pizons of QA.

[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.660]
I'm where we have big balls, Donna.

[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:56.920]
And you too, Eddie Jones.

[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.380]
You silly old pussy, man.

[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:01.200]
An old, wrinkled up man who turns out to be a pussy.

[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.860]
Here, pussy, pussy, pussy, here, pussy.

[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.140]
Eddie Jones, who lives in the same complex spot of ways

[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.480]
you're good close personal friend.

[01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:09.460]
Yeah.

[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.240]
I'm talking about the rim man.

[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:11.720]

[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.280]
Oh.

[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:15.760]
Anyway, let me tell you, speaker of the rim man,

[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:17.320]
look at this, the pizza loft spot is next.

[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:18.080]
That's just a coincidence.

[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:21.500]
Now the rim man needs to have a very reduced price.

[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.500]
And you know, the prices are so cheap there,

[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:26.220]
you'd have to be real cheap, that's for discounting a place like that.

[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:26.580]
You know what?

[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:29.540]
Because Jeff has kept the prices low through all of these years.

[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.720]
The food is delicious, it's all cooked fresh to order.

[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:34.020]
And the prices are so tiny, you can bring the whole gang

[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:34.860]
and over and over again.

[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.900]
Every Monday like tonight is lasagna night at both loft locations,

[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:39.160]
Tuesday's eggplant night.

[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:42.720]
Buy one of these dinners on these days and get the second one for only five bucks.

[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.560]
Who would want a discount on a price like that except the cheapest of the cheap, cheap, cheap?

[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:49.660]
Every Wednesday kids eat food with it all, say, can see Jeff's famous magician.

[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.980]
Every Thursday is bite night at the loft, come on a motorcycle.

[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.180]
Buy one, dinner, get the second one for half price.

[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:57.640]
They got all kinds of combinations.

[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:01.000]
And as if you're not eating there before, you can figure out what you like the best.

[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.340]
A little bit of this, a lot of that.

[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.340]
They got chicken and veal seafood, three different kinds of great pizza,

[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.680]
calzone, super subs and other.

[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:09.160]
It's Passover, like I said, four different kinds of great pizza,

[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:14.060]
because they got that matsu pizza and matsu lasagna just in time for paysocks,

[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:14.840]
as George would say.

[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:19.620]
Two locations in Davy, they're on a university driving to in Griffithin 595,

[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:25.040]
called 954, 9116 for takeoff, for delivery, for catering as low as five bucks per person.

[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.460]
But what kind of a skintle and what on the discount off of that?

[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.860]
954, 9116, 88, 80 or the new location that I say what I was yesterday.

[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.800]
And the new location is in plantation, right out there by Walgreens,

[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.800]
right behind Walgreens on the corner of Navhilan sunrise,

[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.140]
with the same great food and same great low prices.

[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:42.800]
954, 382, 1999.

[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:48.600]
382, 1999 for the world famous pizza loft, now with two outstanding broward locations.

[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.960]
Live, live, and local, here's sports radio 560,

[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:54.640]
viewing 2AM.

[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:57.800]
Gangrape is funny.

[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:04.280]
If you missed the Neil Rogers show yesterday on 610 WIOD, you missed this.

[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.680]
Is this the bird?

[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:06.220]
Yeah.

[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:07.280]
Bird, how you doing?

[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:07.660]
Okay.

[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:12.660]
Listen, do me a favor, play anything, because I can't stand listening to you.

[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:14.240]
You start like a douchebag.

[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:15.240]
Do what?

[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.760]
Just do me a favor, play anything.

[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.700]
Well, can I ask you a question before you go?

[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.900]
Oh, God, you sound so stupid, I hate to talk to you.

[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:22.500]
Yeah, go ahead.

[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:23.680]
Well, why did you call me?

[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:24.500]
I didn't call you.

[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.640]
You know, just to tell you not to say anything, just play something.

[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:31.180]
Oh, God can't stand it.

[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:32.680]
Well, then why are you listening?

[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:34.380]
I'll play something already.

[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.760]
Why won't you answer me?

[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.120]
Oh, God, stand it.

[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.080]
You won't see who won't talk to me.

[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:40.340]
Oh, we got a car here.

[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:40.740]
Hello.

[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.940]
1032 at 560 WIOD, we got a car here.

[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.860]
We don't even have a car here on his phone.

[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:48.320]
They don't want to talk to the bird.

[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:50.220]
Oh, we ain't seen too much these days.

[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:51.460]
They shouldn't want to talk to me.

[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:52.000]
I'll tell you that.

[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:52.680]
Look at that phone.

[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.560]
What a choppin' the kneecaps that is.

[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.620]
You know, what a smack right in the old...

[01:11:58.620 --> 01:11:59.660]
Rectome from this audience.

[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:01.960]
Feeling great.

[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:02.920]
Sun is shining.

[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:03.820]
It's a beautiful day.

[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.660]
The birds are chirping.

[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.440]
Everything's looking up.

[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.220]
We're smelling roses.

[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.440]
The South of Iraq is now largely under British control.

[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:11.220]
And it really is more more than you want.

[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.660]
Oh, nothing.

[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:15.820]
Here's the fact that 5667-0560,

[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.840]
pound 560 on the AT&T,

[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.200]
and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.900]
This man, this is pathetic.

[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:22.140]
This is sad.

[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:24.960]
And by the way, I'm still waiting for one of you flag waivers out there.

[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:28.080]
One of you pro-war supporters who thinks we've just done a wonderful job

[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.680]
of liberating the oppressed peoples of Iraq.

[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:32.620]
I want to hear what your feelings are about all these butchered people, huh?

[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:33.460]
There are none.

[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.140]
Oh, that's right.

[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:35.940]
We just made that up.

[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.460]
Facts as I just returned from Spain this weekend is Spanya.

[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.560]
An American friend of mine that works on the US Air Base there.

[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:50.000]
She told me that some of the brands there feel that they'd better find some weapons of mass destruction.

[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.300]
Or we'll look even worse in the eyes of the world than we already do if that's possible or response.

[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:56.660]
If we don't find any, we will plant some while we've been saying it a long time.

[01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:03.100]
Also, the word the media all over Spain is all over Europe is that Syria is next sooner rather than later.

[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:16.300]
And just as I was reading this facts, the crawler on the news on the BDN CDC was Colin Powell says the US is very concerned about Syria's chemical weapons.

[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:24.840]
The anxious Colin Powell who used to be Mr. Dove and now for whatever reason has been transformed into a super hawk.

[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:28.680]
It was like that scene in the Godfather where he came into the courtroom with the pentangeles brothers.

[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:29.000]
Yeah.

[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.800]
They made him an offering couldn't refuse.

[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.700]
Together we are restoring many key services.

[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:40.780]
Most public health clinics are operational and you watch those dead people come back to life.

[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:44.840]
You as soon as they turn all the good stuff back on the water and the electric and stuff you watch.

[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:45.940]
You'll see.

[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.640]
Here's Davy. Hello.

[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:49.560]
Hey, I know how are you today.

[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:50.260]
Okay, sir.

[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.800]
I'll tell you something really surprising about this war.

[01:13:54.420 --> 01:14:01.860]
I haven't seen anything by American with the anti-French and anti-German and anti-Everybody and on and on.

[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:05.780]
You know, you would think if you really wanted to support your troops, you'd buy something American.

[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:07.720]
So when they came home, they'd actually have a job.

[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:08.640]
Yeah.

[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:10.520]
Have you been like a Volvo?

[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.920]
Have you seen anything at all relating to any of that?

[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:19.600]
The Walmart used to have a giant buy American but then they got busted for selling like high-wand stuff.

[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:20.240]
Chinese.

[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:21.420]

[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:28.360]
So you would think that if people really wanted to support their country and really wanted to support the troops instead of buying a little yellow ribbon that go out by a Chevy.

[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:35.140]
Now, I think if people really wanted to support their country, they'd register to vote and make sure we don't have another four years of this and make sure that the world keeps spinning around for a while.

[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.800]
Doesn't that make a long story short?

[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:38.520]
Yeah. Thanks.

[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:39.060]
Have a great day.

[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.060]
5, 6, 7.

[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:44.100]
Oh, this, this, here's our last call. This is, this is, seriously.

[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:49.700]
This to me, I have said this a thousand times before but it never, ever fails to us. It's never stops.

[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:52.020]
Is a shocker.

[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.020]
Here's our last call for Lauderdale. Hello.

[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:57.980]
Hey. Yes, sir.

[01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:59.460]
Very good show. Very good show. Yes it is.

[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:02.760]
You're not getting too many calls though. They're all watching the CNN news.

[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:03.780]
No, they're not.

[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:05.040]
Oh, okay.

[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.820]
There's nothing to it. There's nothing to exciting going on right now. You know, no statues falling down.

[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:15.600]
Do you think they haven't found any like nerve gas lately or no nuclear weapons? No.

[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:19.460]
Because it would be nice if they could find like half of one.

[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.900]
They found a couple of pesdospences but that was about it.

[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:25.420]
I work for a big Toyota dealership. There's people in the way they're watching.

[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:29.540]
They've got the war on there. 24 hours. People are like, ready to bash their heads against the wall.

[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.160]
Yeah. They're seeing their waiting for an hour for an oil change.

[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.440]
And they're watching the, it's brutal.

[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:38.520]
The least they could do is put Jerry Springer on. Something, anything.

[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:41.100]
You know, even the, the, the comic channel.

[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:43.300]
Yeah. Well, have a great day.

[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:46.320]
And back to you. Okay. Obviously we're done with the calls pretty much.

[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:51.240]
I'm a couple of them flashing there but it's pretty obvious to me that they're not going to be too much going on today.

[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:56.260]
Well, let's pace up coming up and it's a good Friday and Franklin Graham's over to Christianize all those

[01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:58.260]
turbine heads and the world's going to be great.

[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:02.660]
A base fully representative Iraqi intern authority.

[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.400]
Here's a great fact is this. Do you remember the PBS front line show on the FBI's?

[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.980]
I'll cut investigator John O'Neal and the man who knew I sure do.

[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:15.000]
Remember that the ambassador to Yemen Barbara Bodine toward his investigation in the law.

[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:16.700]
That's a group that had hit the USS Colisee.

[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:18.800]
I sure do. Bingo mission accomplished.

[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:21.660]
She gets a position in the Iraqi transitional government. Let's hear it for Barbara.

[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:26.620]
Oh, they had the James Woolsey on the news last night.

[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.820]
Former CIA guy. Oh, scary, scary, scary.

[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:32.460]
The one that says we're in WDW 4 right now.

[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:38.060]
And that Egypt and Saudi Arabia are quaking in their boots and they should be scared and you know,

[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:39.300]
they better watch that they're going to be next.

[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:44.140]
I mean, the government's been taken over by a bunch of crazy people and the public sitting back there

[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:45.700]
wants to know what time of American idols on.

[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.200]
What time is it on by the way?

[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:49.020]
Toto.

[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:54.000]
She helped toward the O'Neal investigation into 911 al-Qaeda terrorists that could have prevented 911.

[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:58.620]
Now she gets a job in Iraq after the Bush junta did their best to falsely connect Iraq to 911.

[01:16:59.040 --> 01:16:59.900]
Do you smell vermin?

[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.660]
Absolutely correct sir.

[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:04.280]
I smell crap, man. I can't say that. It's smell vermin.

[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:10.760]
The veteran Foreign Service Officer Barbara Bodine's appointment as a key player in Iraq's transitional government

[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:14.520]
has angered defense department officials and federal law enforcement authorities who believe

[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:19.500]
that as US ambassador to Yemen, she blocked an FBI investigation into the 2000 bombing of the US's cold.

[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.340]
This is from the highly conservative Washington Times, by the way.

[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.280]
Pentagon steamed at Bush's choice for post-war Iraq.

[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:31.000]
Working through a number of channels, including the Pentagon, the Justice Department and the Senate.

[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:35.780]
Several high ranking federal authorities are calling on President Bush to rescind the appointment.

[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:45.760]
Ms. Bodine, a diplomat and residence at the University of California, Santa Barbara was named last month by Mr. Bush as director of relief and reconstruction for central Iraq based in Baghdad.

[01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:53.020]
She served in Baghdad during Sodom's regime later in Kuwait and then in Yemen, where she was ambassador from 97 to 2001.

[01:17:53.780 --> 01:18:01.960]
After the October 12, 2000 suicide bombing of the cold, which killed 17 US sailors injured 35 others, she served as chief negotiator between the US and Yemeni governments.

[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:07.900]
The State Department has successfully imposed Barbara Bodine on the defense department team dealing with post-sautom who say in Iraq said,

[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:16.180]
one former high ranking Senate official, close to the Pentagon, she used to be the mayor of Baghdad in essence, the defense department is livid, but there seems to be nothing they can do.

[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:29.160]
A Pentagon official who asked not to be identified, said Ms. Bodine dismissed warnings of terrorist attacks in Yemen against Uyghats and allowed the cold to enter port at a reduced security level because she felt the value of showing US presence in Yemen overweighed the risks.

[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:47.160]
But she's never said she was sorry that she made a mistake, said the official FBI executives in agents familiar with the cold probes at Ms. Bodine and ambassador in Yemen prevented the bureau from advancing its investigation into bombing at a time when agents were beginning to focus on Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden.

[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:55.860]
The bureau's top terrorist hunter, John O'Neal, headed the cold probed and was laying the groundwork for a conspiracy case against El Qaeda more than year before the 9-11 attacks.

[01:18:56.180 --> 01:19:12.660]
He had been sent by FBI director Lewis Fried to Yemen with the force of 100 agents, lab experts and forensic specialists, but FBI officials said the cold investigation was stymied by Ms. Bodine and that she made little effort to encourage Yemeni authorities to cooperate despite a number of death threats against agents by Islamic terrorists.

[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:17.440]
The police just refused to allow investigators to carry the weapons Mr. O'Neal considered necessary for the protection.

[01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:35.160]
And it goes on. It's just nauseating and the public is like, let's form a human shane and let's march from Wellington to the aid county and show how much we support the commandorant thief and our troops and how patriotic we are and ours is bigger than yours and our flag too.

[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.420]
Yadi, yadi, yadi.

[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:38.460]
Man.

[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:39.460]

As the bond's dropped from the stars gone far away.

[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:06.680]
Maybe we should have paid attention a little bit more to the fat switch, or sweet notes.

[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:13.940]
The price of cash is too long but I'm afraid that the line won't be very long.

[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:56.620]
You know I have like a long straw so we can sip a little bit of water just enough to stay alive. I think that's a great idea

[01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:00.980]
Hey fat boy everybody hates you like poison you're a pain in the ass Pali

[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:05.620]
Miami hello, I knew yes, sir. I got one point to me

[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:10.040]
Okay, it's about a year ago when we had the stem so thin going on with bush naughty feeders huggers

[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.760]
No one wanted to do it because you know, he went to keep the life alive

[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:18.760]
Right right now when the war is going on I've heard one person mentioned all these soldiers with futures and wires and kids and

[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:21.400]
Acceler doesn't matter and I had no one brought this up

[01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:26.940]
Yeah, well that's because they only care about that nebulous unborn life once I've always said that once you're alive

[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:29.160]
You're on your own man. They don't care about you

[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:31.220]
They're a new thing, but they will pray for them

[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:37.120]
Now pray for your souls. Okay after we stick you in the ground. Oh, he's in a better plate

[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:40.260]
I was thinking about that yesterday in the cab ride. I don't know what made me think about that

[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:47.620]
The stupid things that people regrettuletously stupid things that people are conditioned to saying somebody dies

[01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:52.560]
Oh, he's in a better place now. Yeah, I know what it was it was the services that were having for some of the

[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:56.420]
Somebody dead soldiers. Mm-hmm. Oh

[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:57.920]
He's in a but no, no, he's not in a better place

[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:01.960]
He's in a box in a ground rotting. He missed out on the overwhelming majority of his life

[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:04.560]
He missed all the opportunities he had to enjoy life

[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:08.880]
I'll try to ration lives. I'll try to make an excuse. He's in a better place

[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:15.260]
Here then all the time. It's just a stupid idiotic thing or or he's up there looking down on us now

[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:19.560]
That's another one of my favorites. He's up there looking down on us now. Oh, he's not

[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:25.180]
He's in a ground in a box rotting. No, he's in that great fill in the blank in the sky

[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:32.960]
And a great the ballpark in the sky and the athletes love to use that to the sports people. Oh, that's one of their favorite course in the sky

[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:33.700]
right

[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:39.120]
You know, I'd like to see a golf course in the sky not on the ground just in the sky

[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:43.120]
Maybe that's why we have hallows big hailstorms, you know

[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:47.320]
Yeah, when it hails the size of golf balls maybe they dropped a few. I don't know

[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.080]
Of course if they do drop murmur can pick them up in the you know, seldom

[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:53.720]
He said he's doing a hell of a business by the way

[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:59.080]
Stunless golf balls. He's every night two in the morning. He swims across the little lake puts on his little bathing suit

[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.820]
Swims across the lake and he's got a fishnet grabs up all the balls he can

[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:10.380]
Worshes him off at least and then he's got he got that son on the front lawn any Jones is still parked off about a by-the-way rumor rumors balls

[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:15.120]
I guess any Jones is just afraid of balls, you know it

[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:23.940]
5 6 7 that's what mad dog said 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:28.940]
In fact, I mentioned that he Jones at the so mad dog in the airport yesterday. He ran he ran right down a concourse

[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.700]
So see ya be good. That was the end of that

[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.700]
Here's Miami. Hello

[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:38.960]
Hello, yes, sir. Oh, I'm on it sounds just like you

[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:44.400]
Okay, good morning. I have a question one of the things I remember I

[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:48.200]
It's sort of disturbed me. I didn't know why until I thought about it later

[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:54.600]
Then heard someone else comment about it was that flag when put being put over the face of Saddam when they put that flag

[01:27:54.600 --> 01:28:00.140]
I mean right you down and I thought well they did that once before and they said no we aren't there

[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:03.980]
Are they getting that in buzzer right right and then and then it happened again

[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.740]
And so I wondered why but then I realized there's something disturbing about this picture

[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:11.660]
I realized the flag was upside down

[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:18.320]
The stars are supposed to be up top if it's under the bottom that means there's a dire distress

[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:23.800]
So I wondered why there was no comment on anything said about that because it seemed awfully odd

[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:30.440]
They didn't care which direction was and they just they were just panicking because they realized that it looked like we were occupying and

[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:35.140]
Taking over as opposed to like putting the Iraqi flag back on there and it was in very poor taste

[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.160]
Even it was a time it's a time for like about 10 seconds. It looked kind of cute

[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:44.760]
Okay, well, I just thought of a bizarre. Well, it should be our worst problem

[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:46.640]
Have a great day. Thank you. You too

[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:51.700]
See that's an old expression. I've heard a million times that should be our worst problem and right that fits right there

[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:56.520]
Speaking of people shlup in these stars and stripes since a lot of people are very concerned about that

[01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:01.260]
Phara faucet was one of the real real super patriot flag waving celebrities

[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:04.940]
In the face which I like to point out by the way those people are okay

[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:13.320]
Right, see you understand this sure why I want you to get this right the people who support the administration the people who are on the right the people who are

[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:19.340]
hawkish the surely Joneses and a Phara faucets and and a Brad Pitt's in the world those are the good people

[01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:24.560]
So they can speak out as much as they want as long as they go step along Phara faucet in the tabloids

[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.880]
Which I should have brought him I left him under plane

[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:29.960]
I thought who the hell needs tabloids with everything else going on

[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:33.440]
Maybe we'll have to make tabloids Tuesday tomorrow to wean people away from all this war talk

[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:41.420]
But anyway, she's showing wearing this flowing gown and the stars and stripes the flag is the whole back of her gown

[01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:43.260]
And it's like she's dragging it on the floor

[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:47.640]
That's a violation of flag protocol and they've got like about seven billion letters in the

[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:50.960]
whichever tabloid that was just ripping her in ass

[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:55.000]
I've got the handbook in there the flag for like sleeping the flag on the on the floor

[01:29:55.980 --> 01:30:00.380]
But you see she's so much more patriotic than most of the rest of especially us. Well

[01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:02.440]
I mean, what is that?

[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:09.080]
It's like a like a pissing contest which one's more patriotic than the other one mines a lot bigger than yours is yeah look at that

[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:09.780]
I'm waving it

[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.580]
I'm stretching it

[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.980]
I'm yanking it

[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:22.940]
But it's not that that's a double standard you understand right pro war people right wing people good

[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:30.100]
celebrities and otherwise left wing people anti-war people people in the middle people like aren't from a butchery bad

[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:36.280]
Okay, let them dummy up Michael Moore Susan Sarandon all of those people Tim Robbins

[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.840]
Martin Sheen shut your yaps on time. It's Ron Penn. Oh definitely put him in a pen put him back in a pokey

[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:49.620]
But like I said last week we taught the Iraqis the hokey pokey wing would be proud wouldn't be surprised if Wayne opens up a few blockbusters

[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:51.120]
Get back in a company again. Yeah

[01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:56.140]
There'd be a blockbuster on every corner a Baptist church kitty corner across from that a bar

[01:30:56.660 --> 01:31:00.280]
Puzzle mat and then a Mac Donalds and right next to a Burger King a Wendy's

[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:05.140]
Boy too bad Dave Thomas bit the big one before he could be around to see this

[01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:16.360]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line maybe maybe the guy to call before about the people in the

[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:18.740]
What was in the auto shop?

[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:21.440]
Can the world change or whatever I think he's right

[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.060]
Anything but the war maybe we should just give it a rest, you know

[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:27.600]
AB W

[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:31.040]

No, but you always talking how like oh nobody ever called me and Miami sucks and this and that I just want to know. Miami does suck

[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:11.720]
That's not my opinion. I mean, that's a fact you better look it up. Oh, yeah, it's not a best-based living, but I mean

[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:15.680]

[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:31.140]
I'm waiting negative Nelly. Okay

[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:37.460]
Reuters Afghan officials says Pakistan backing the Taliban. Oh not again

[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:45.180]
Candidary Afghan is standing Afghan official accused Pakistan today of backing the reemergence of the fundamentalist Taliban

[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:48.800]
Militia and of involvement in the murder of two relatives of a provincial governor

[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:55.320]
A cousin and another relative of Kandahar governor Ghul Agashirzai were killed by suspected Taliban militants in the Pakistan

[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:59.540]
He brought a town of Shaman on Sunday while it's not what Michael Jackson. I was a shaman

[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:04.860]
While his brother sheriff Sharzai was also injured. It's quickly. It's so negative. Sorry

[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:10.000]
Pakistan's hand is behind this event governor. Sure as I spoke from in Khalid Pashhtun told Reuters

[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:14.360]
The Taliban carried out the attack but it happened in areas under control of Pakistan

[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:20.340]
And we haven't passed passed out of them our complaints about their support for the Taliban without the support of Pakistan

[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:23.420]
The Taliban would have been able to do what he said and he is probably

[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:28.620]
Absolutely correct sir. The attack carried out by two people on motor thickles came today after the governor's son

[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:33.940]
Our seaf was beaten up in Shaman by several people including Pakistani army officials Pashhtun said

[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:38.420]
You said the shooting was carried out by members of the ousted Taliban regime which Pakistan backed

[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:41.820]
Until the 9-11 attacks on the US to televan as we know well we know that

[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:47.060]
Uh speak at 9-11. Yeah, didn't we talk about those people didn't do anything to deserve their fate

[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:50.980]
And they just happen to be in a wrong place at the wrong time both in the World Trade Center in the Pentagon right

[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:53.700]
You see the similarities and I'm not talking about the military

[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:59.560]
But I'm talking about the civilians the thousands of casualties in Iraq about those people have it to be in the wrong place

[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:03.060]
People really died those time at the wrong time. Oh, that's right. The ones here really died

[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:06.940]
And the ones over there was just a propaganda on the seabed right the BBC and

[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:09.180]
Open seared and was in for the same body you know

[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:11.100]
I said are angled making it look like a whole bunch right

[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:14.860]
Oh, no, I must have had a brain fart during the break

[01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:18.340]
I was flipping over to a chat couple of things out which the Dow and the Nasdaq are up

[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:24.340]
They like them dead bodies and I actually flipped over to CNN for a second. Oh, I want to say again

[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:28.260]
Wolf Blitzkrieg is the biggest right wing suckle. I mean, it's just unbelievable

[01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:33.520]
What an administration lackey he's become all with the makes cold and powerful fate and wind significance

[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:38.400]
South report by Van Brown of the BBC the BBC

[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:43.980]
Yes, he was at US and he's completely briefing this morning and Doha he joins us now

[01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:51.340]
So fall some reporters wanted to know if the fall of to create means the war is over what are coalition commanders saying about that

[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.480]
Did you see a way you know the first way a first

[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:02.880]
Way they described to create today was the site of the only significant military operation in the last 24 hours in Iraq

[01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:08.940]
So think about that the whole country and that's the only place major military action has been going on the last 24 hours

[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:12.480]
That says everything's finished everywhere else side for them hopping up

[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:19.480]
So the question if the creep is falling or as it may have already fallen does that mean the war is over

[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:25.980]
It's exactly the question we put to briefers at the briefing at central command and we put it to bring it to general vince Brooks

[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:28.440]
Here's some of what he had to say much question

[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:33.400]
We know that there are still some places where we have not accounted for all military activity

[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:40.780]
There are also places inside the country with not physically gone to yet and that has to be where the weapons of access to stress and right

[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:42.500]
Wouldn't you think of course

[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.880]
Here's a call from Kendall hello

[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:50.600]
Can't yes, sir. I know mr. Negativity. I should say right

[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:52.080]
Hey listen

[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:57.300]
It's only just coming out but the I think the largest crime even worse than the

[01:39:57.820 --> 01:39:59.820]
killing in death of all the civilians

[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:08.420]
Is the crime on both sides where they the citizens and all were allowed to loot both the

[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.100]
Library and museum and of antiquities as we

[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:14.920]
and completely destroyed everything of

[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:20.340]
Zion worth to man. Well, I think that the lives of the people who died and were butchered up

[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:24.160]
Are worth more than the end the things you the artifacts you're talking about but

[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:30.380]
That's got to be a close second billions of dollars worth of irreplaceable artifacts some as old as 7,000 years old

[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:35.180]
Exactly, and no, you know, I'll go into there, you know, lies are more important

[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:39.580]
But it is the fault of both sides first all the people should realize

[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:44.980]
The worth of what it was of minor stand the Americans never the

[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:52.000]
Franks and his guys and coming down from Bush they never made any plans to sit there and protect the thing

[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.260]
But they made sure they were protecting the oil

[01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:58.380]
But you do understand that there's no oil in the Iraqi museum

[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:02.480]
Right exactly. That's what I'm saying. They were protecting the oil. There's no reason to hook a hose up to it

[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:06.140]
You know, so you know, they had their priorities obviously, you know, so

[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:12.440]
But it is a tragedy. I mean how difficult would it have been to take a few thousand military police and put them in there

[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:16.700]
One once we had to place clean out and put them in there armed military police

[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:20.980]
Put them on every street corner just like you see in even today in many of the cities in Europe and

[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:26.180]
Could have avoided all this insanity. No preparation. They knew a month ahead that they were gonna do this

[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:30.500]
This wasn't any great shock. This was planned a long time ago. Well, you know rumsels, you know

[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:35.860]
Boys will be boys there. Yeah, a little untidyness after the war that why keep thinking of that word untidy

[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:37.880]
And keep thinking of all those bodies strewn around

[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:48.020]
And one last thing bomb our net are not on mfm right will used to be doctor Bob right? Yeah, I got a hint to him for

[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:52.540]
Reporting as far as describing what happened

[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:56.560]
He's been up there with Hemingway is trying as far as trying to bring the historical

[01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:03.980]
Sentin to and all that but he lost his on objectivity so early into that reporting that it's like you just watching me

[01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:09.020]
It's like okay. I'm listening to the you know the fall of Paris now not listening to oh

[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:14.360]
Yeah, well he was embedded don't forget and he admitted very early on that he developed this great empathy with the troops there and

[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.980]
He was just a shield true true, but

[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:20.500]
He can though on the level that how we did report is quite good

[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:25.960]
But you know he just lost it after well. Oh, he deals can do a good job. Have a great day take our welcome them

[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:26.400]
See you

[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:31.040]
You're so negative now. What's that noise I hear out in the hallway you think they're coming to get me. Uh-oh

[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:35.120]
I'll let you know is it drillin five six seven oh five yeah, they found a world

[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:43.220]
pound five sixty on the 18 T and four is in wireless line the governing party continues while the

[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:47.180]
Liberals are banking on voters wanting oh, that's that Quebec stuff. We don't want to hear about that no

[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:54.220]
Oh, frost off on issue and don't be no freedom fries don't be given no freedom kiss and don't be doing any of that stuff

[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:58.240]
We have some freedom toast for both of them don't be even any of them freedom pace. We see that we're that freedom toast

[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:02.600]
I do like freedom toast though a lot here's Kendall. Hello

[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:04.300]
Hey, me. Yes, sir

[01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:09.000]
Yeah, I just wanted to call and say this stuff on the worst grade. I don't think you're you're negative

[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:15.140]
I think you're being objective as possible. I mean you're providing common sense which I don't think the rest of the media is doing

[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:21.900]
Well, you know, and I try to get simple answers to simple questions from the people who disagree and yet I don't hear from any of them

[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:26.020]
Yeah, that's you're never here for them for they want to take some kind of a verbal shot at me

[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:29.180]
But in terms of answering their questions, they seem incapable of doing it

[01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:33.500]
Yeah, I have yeah, and I agree with you, but I mean on more lighthearted stuff

[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:38.200]
I just had to comment on mo I want to tell you uh Michael Moore's new movies gonna be mo and me

[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:39.420]
He's gonna write about that

[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.440]
I mean this is this is unbelievable

[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:50.100]
You got to copy uh, you know, a free clean from dry concepts to clean up that uh to pay you a complainant about it earlier

[01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:51.760]
They might do a good job on it

[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:57.580]
They might suck something on it. Okay, pal, I work on it. Have a great day that mo. He's an asshole. We know that

[01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:03.440]
Yeah, I miss him already, you know what I missed that bonding. I missed the waves through the window at me in the morning when I come in

[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:05.400]
All of these things

[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:10.200]
Him opening up the door and saying you can't put fake hair on our real hair on our fake head

[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:14.600]
Huh, you had to write the first time you can't put real hair on our fake hair on a real head

[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:15.920]
Oh, he's trying

[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:22.100]
He sure is touchy about that. Uh, do it. Yeah, I had no idea. Touchy. You know if I had known way back then

[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:27.360]
When you get to be in that the age category when you get to be in your mid to late 70s and you're worried about how your

[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:31.560]
Hair looks and he's still worried about my pants and about my shirt

[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:35.280]
You know like I'm coming under to be a fashion the first thing he said when I came back

[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:37.240]
Take off those checkered pants. I couldn't believe it

[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:43.440]
You know, you let me worry about my pants and you worry about yours your pantaloonies. Okay, your lime green pants and your

[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:48.340]
Cosvans you silly old man you see there. He got me started again on a momeister like close personal friend

[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:52.060]
Howard don't be so negative. Yeah, there. I'm being negative again. You're right

[01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:58.180]
You're absolutely right. I apologize profusely. Don't I know screw it and screw mo too

[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:02.400]
Moe they hate you man. They don't like you at all. They can't stand you

[01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:06.940]
Med dog had a real interesting comment at the airport yet. I'm not gonna repeat it

[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:11.200]
I wouldn't do that would be bad. I like the mad dog a lot. He's a great guy. I wouldn't do that, but it was interesting

[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:15.120]
I'll tend to be for the show tomorrow. All right, and maybe I'm a show today

[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.940]
It all depends on which way the winds blow

[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:22.960]
Just take your finger out the window. No actually. Let me let me take a look because I want to be positive even though I am in Toronto

[01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:27.720]
I don't want to hear that SARS coming through my window here. I do have the window crack open pretty good

[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:29.140]
Gonna be 70 here today

[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:36.600]
Poor little even case you missed it little leave is dead. We're so sorry little evil boy. Oh, uh, what am I looking for on this thing? Oh, it's eight

[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:41.060]
Which is what 46? It's 46 right now. I'm gonna be up to 70 today

[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:47.580]
And 79 tomorrow holy crap. See I brought the one with me

[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:55.860]
I'm gonna suspect them when the show's over to open up my door and see dozens and dozens of wonderful people out there ready to thank me lined up to kiss my ring

[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:02.480]
See there's that ego again big fat ego. He's very negative a bad guy. I admit it. I'm a bad fat guy

[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:08.580]
Not as bad as Jeff high and I never would lie. I'd like a Pokemon II

[01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:10.520]
Anyway, he's he's

[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:16.800]
Yeah, these people that are calling about how negative you try working a QA for a few weeks. Okay. Let's see how negative you'd be

[01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:21.200]
You'd be running around you. I'll tell you one thing a lot of these guys that give us crap about how negative we are

[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:26.020]
They had to be going out of the pawn shops and buying some used revolvers. They'd be maybe over there, you know

[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:32.280]
Shoot and target practice after stealing of course only because we don't advocate violence, but they'd be pretty fired up and pissed off, you know what

[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:36.100]
Working with a bunch of arrogant butt plugs like we got in that place

[01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:39.400]
Kits off gets me fired up when I hear someone say that amen

[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.060]
1113 at 560 wqm your negative station for the new malmelonium

[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:50.760]
I'll tell you about something positive. Oh, man. I'm popping it in my push. Don't I sound great? It's telling just fine

[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:52.900]
I sound just like me

[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:57.600]
Anyway, it's good stuff. I'm taking it for my blood pressure and my blood pressure is sensational

[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:03.120]
You know, I got up this morning before even take my took my pills my blood pressure was 128 over 68

[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:10.620]
Okay, it turns about right? You know, you know, I'm not even talking to you. Okay, then we've got three digits one's got two

[01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:15.180]
Yeah, one's got a pair all your meds off gels, which you just pop in your push every day

[01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:20.500]
They contain pharmaceutical grade olive oil the best money can buy not just plain ordinary pedestrian olive oil

[01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:24.840]
Which is you know, it's okay, but super concentrated olive oil loaded with health benefits

[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:30.100]
Popping some olive and your pussy every day cannot produce the risk of heart disease and high cholesterol plus

[01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:37.360]
There now are 14 different olyomete formulas from which show you can choose for you to be choosing from each one combining the finest olive oil

[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:42.720]
You'll be finding anywhere with the vitamins minerals and herbals to support specific health needs from your bones to your blood pressure

[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:48.140]
To your immune system you just pick out the formulas that are right for you and now there are three new olyomete formulas

[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:50.520]

And coke you 10 for your heart, which is really great. You'll be a lot more positive when you take olyomete

[01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:57.380]
In fact, that's why I'm in such a good mood right now. I'm popping it

Nothing worse than being the last one to reply an email right Lynn

[01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:22.740]
Yeah, she in fact Lynn just the Lynn sammulas just emailed me. She's going to Vegas for a few days

[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:27.400]
She's gonna miss the show tomorrow Wednesday and Thursday. I don't think that's acceptable. Is it no

[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:31.660]
So I emailed her right back and I said any winnings over a million I get half

[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:35.500]
And then the great part of it is she's the only person I do email with

[01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:38.840]
Right, so I don't have to worry about all that stuff

[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:41.760]
This is very depressing news. I don't want to be negative again

[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:46.060]
So if you're one of those people emotional cripples that can't handle the truth turn your radio away download

[01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:48.880]
Don't change the dial because we don't want you to do that but turn it down like low

[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:51.200]
Put your finger in your rear ear

[01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:54.540]
Are you? Yes, well, this is from yesterday's observer newspaper

[01:49:54.540 --> 01:50:00.500]
You notice the newspapers the print media have been so much more on it as opposed to the electronic media

[01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:05.740]
Oh, it's just embarrassing. That's why some of us have to keep watching the cvc through which

[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:10.220]
credible and legitimate local leaders see there you go

[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:11.180]
Are you?

[01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:16.380]
US military contractor accused of human rights violations is one a multi-million dollar contract to police post-sautom

[01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:17.700]
Iraqi observer can reveal

[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:27.040]
Dine Corp which is donated more than 150,000 dollars to the Republican Party began recruiting for a private police force in Iraq last week on behalf of the West State Department

[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:28.180]
I'll be danged

[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:36.220]
The wording of such a sensitive contract to Dine Corp has caused consternation and constipation in some circles over the company's policing record

[01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:42.520]
A British employment tribunal recently forced Dine Corp to pay 175,000 dollars in compensation to a UN police officer

[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:47.940]
It unfairly sacked in Bosnia for whistle blowing on Dine Corp colleagues involved in an illegal sex ring

[01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:54.520]
An observer a reporter who contacted the firms US headquarters purporting to be a potential police recruit for Iraq

[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:57.500]
Was told it was hoping to get people on the ground in two to four weeks

[01:50:57.500 --> 01:51:01.920]
The recruited told the reporter we could expect a seller of $80,000 plus hazard bonuses

[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:07.060]
He was offered a contract of between three months and a year and told he didn't need to be able to speak Arabic

[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:10.340]
He had to be a US citizen who would serve as a police officer in America

[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:14.980]
And when the reporter said he'd worked in Texas for a number of years he was totally sounded ideal

[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:21.920]
Despite Dine Corp's demands for US citizens only it's offering the private contracts to its British office in alder shot

[01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:22.980]
Alder shot

[01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:27.640]
Former labor defense minister Peter Kylfoyl said last night

[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:32.340]
I find it difficult to believe that at a time when bringing law in order to Iraq needs to be handled with delicacy and sensitivity

[01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:36.880]
A private American firm like Dine Corp is entrusted with a job and there we go again

[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:40.800]
It's not just this present and his buddies and all of their big business buddies

[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:45.240]
It's uh, that's not a part of what it's all about. That's all about. That's what it's about

[01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:51.640]
Jesus Christ well, well, what do we have to do put up billboards? Do we have to put it on TV 24 hours?

[01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:55.460]
Did they get to sink into the stupid masses out there coming up again? Oh, right

[01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:58.020]
It still won't get the job done. It doesn't penetrate

[01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:04.480]
You've heard of abs of steel. We've got minds of steel. You can't penetrate a man

[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:09.380]
Robin Pumbito beach with the insus welcome back to earth see there's one yeah

[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:13.940]
There's a guy's uh glad to have you back and not too ashamed to admit it well

[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:16.260]
He says here's my two cents

[01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:24.020]
All you assholes using the terms patriotism in the wrong context here's the actual definition the term nationalist is what you really mean to say

[01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:30.380]
According to Webster's new universal unabridged dictionary deluxe second edition the true definition of a patriot is first

[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:35.080]
The person who loves and loyalty supports his own country second devoted to the welfare of one's country

[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:41.920]
Here's the definition of nationalist one excessive narrow or jingoist patriotism and two the doctrine that national and

[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:44.560]
Persecurety etc are more important than international considerations

[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:51.180]
Here's the definition of jingoist a person who boasted of his patriotism in favor is an aggressive threatening war like foreign policy

[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:52.180]
Oh son from edu

[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:54.460]
Yeah

[01:52:55.620 --> 01:52:59.920]
Thanks a lot, brob and George thanks you too because he feels very unloved by this audience

[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:04.020]
It just doesn't care enough to send him their very best. They hate him like poison and they want him to know it

[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:11.300]
Oh, you know, we took up that pull one day about what makes them turn the dial real fast uh-huh and right there along with you was

[01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:14.860]
Religion in fact in religion come out first being a boy

[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:16.780]
Where they tied

[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.800]
No, we didn't come out after it see what a wafer man. Why weren't they tied?

[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:24.400]
Yeah, let's talk about writing the fence

[01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:29.840]
You can be honest now you ripped George and asked why he was gone all week last week and so did I have at least I admitted

[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:35.020]
But anyway, don't you find that bizarre because religion I

[01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:39.280]
Used to think they enjoyed that we've taken polls about that before but they can't handle it

[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:45.140]
In spite of the fact that religion is like about 50 percent maybe a little less than that percent when you say

[01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:48.260]
About 30 man. Yeah of what's going this is all about

[01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:53.620]
Mm-hmm, but they don't want to hear from that they don't want to say that they're too emotionally crippled at this point

[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:56.180]
They don't want to hear us a shatter their furry tails

[01:53:57.080 --> 01:54:01.160]
All that anti god talking that anti Jesus talking that anti

[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:04.860]
Jew and goyam and the schmata head talk. Well, it's just reality

[01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:09.740]
I realized a lot of you you know, just emotional cripples little little children in adult bodies

[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:13.500]
Some people just never grow up mentally emotionally physically whatever

[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:15.360]
Look at being a boy

[01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:17.020]
Oh

[01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:21.840]
That's poor nutrition on his part though. Yeah, I wonder if he would stop eating

[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:25.920]
If he'd start eating chocolate it would be good to put a few pounds on

[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:26.320]
hey

[01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:28.620]
How can you say that?

[01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:36.640]
He said feed it to the fed iene is what I think he was saying let them gag on it

[01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:43.600]
5670560 pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon or wireless 100 92 and a half today

For the 400th time in your city serious about losing the weight

[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:55.820]
You'll see now that I'm here. I feel great. I'm gonna lose that weight. What was that weight again?

[01:54:56.740 --> 01:55:01.240]
192.5. I got a digital scale so I can even give you I'm not gonna round it back to 192

[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:02.880]
That's I'll give you exactly what it is

[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:08.040]
And we'll see what progress I make while I'm here for a couple of months

[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:10.260]
Here's a lady in Kendall hello

My and local

[01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:19.460]
Here's sports video five sixes you eight you eight

[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:22.680]
To write smash a girl

[01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:35.500]
Oh

[01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:54.880]
much better

[02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:05.100]

[02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:14.200]
Oh

[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:14.200]

[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:24.400]
Would

[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:45.400]
WHAT ARE YOU REALLY LIVE IS..

[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:46.380]
IT'Sorse!

[02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:18.340]
But the Americans probably have such that the willing to do take action if we can demonstrate

[02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:20.280]
that it's against the Paris-Hermen and the United States.

[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:24.840]
The administration, I'm sure, will make that connection or attempt to make that connection.

[02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:30.920]
And given how easily this war has gone, I mean, First Act, Anastana, and now Iraq, yes,

[02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:34.020]
we suffered casualties, but not massive casualties.

[02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:37.980]
I mean, the American people want to feel safe, want to be protected.

[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:42.680]
They want to know that their government is doing something and taking the fight to the enemy.

[02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:48.640]
So I don't think it would be very hard to persuade enough Americans that action against Syria is required.

[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:53.740]
So, and I missed the best part of what he was saying is that they'll use the same tactics that they used before

[02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:57.240]
and convince the public that this is, you know, just part of the war on terrorism

[02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:01.300]
and the Congress and the public will say, yeah, sure, sure.

[02:02:01.300 --> 02:02:02.320]
Whatever you say.

[02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:05.240]
Syria next and then what are the, let's make a list.

[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:07.600]
All the countries are going to invade. Put Canada way down there, please.

[02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:08.380]
Let me know when you're coming.

[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:13.380]
Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico.

[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:15.420]
Huh?

[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:19.420]
The Aleutian Islands. Oh, that's right. That's part of the U.S., whatever.

[02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:21.860]
Nantucket.

[02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:30.400]
Just say, 5'670560, pound 5'60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Lines.

[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:32.700]
Actually, I missed the best part of this guy from the Keto Institute.

[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:35.060]
Remember Keto and the Green Hornet, right?

[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:37.880]
Here's a call from South Miami. Hello.

[02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:39.000]
Hi, Dewey Neil.

[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:40.360]
Very well, thank you.

[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:41.480]
Love you, man. Love you.

[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:44.320]
I got a question for you because I need your advice.

[02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:47.160]
I went to the office of Burntan in the other day.

[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:49.980]
Did you put you in a coma when he started speaking to you?

[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:50.440]
I'm sorry.

[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:52.020]
I said, how did it work out?

[02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:55.560]
Well, I haven't done the program yet.

[02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:59.040]
I just went to check it out and I did see your picture on the wall.

[02:02:59.040 --> 02:02:59.600]
Yeah.

[02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:04.760]
And I wanted to ask you how did it go and should I go further with the program?

[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:05.200]
He's great.

[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:06.240]
He really is good.

[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:07.280]
He really is good.

[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:11.100]
The only reason I stopped going to Burntan is because I moved, you know, and he's way down

[02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:11.580]
there in Kendall.

[02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:14.800]
And I just, I'm too lazy to drive all the way down there.

[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:15.380]
He's good, though.

[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:16.740]
He's a great guy.

[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:20.760]
He's a great guy, but he's got that deep voice.

[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:24.880]
But just because he's so boring, he's so boring that he can put you into a coma without

[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:25.600]
even hypnotizing.

[02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:26.720]
He's good.

[02:03:26.860 --> 02:03:27.440]
I like Burntan.

[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:30.540]
But he's going for smoking or weight or what?

[02:03:31.060 --> 02:03:31.560]
Weight loss.

[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:33.720]
I'm a big fat heifer now and I got to do something.

[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.840]
No, it does work because he got me away from the sweets.

[02:03:37.020 --> 02:03:39.420]
He got me away from all that craving and if I would have kept going, I'd probably still

[02:03:39.420 --> 02:03:39.880]
be alive.

[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:40.760]
Awesome.

[02:03:41.260 --> 02:03:41.260]

[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:41.860]
All right.

[02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:42.560]
I think you need a lovely...

[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:43.020]
Good luck, man.

[02:03:43.300 --> 02:03:43.500]
Good luck.

[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:44.400]
Say I say how to burn.

[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:45.020]
Sure.

[02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:46.460]
He's a good guy, Burntan.

[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:48.360]
I mean, not a little, very boring.

[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:50.620]
But if you're going to be a hypnotist, that's the best time you're boring, right?

[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:52.840]
You will fall asleep now.

[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:56.840]
You know, like some of the shows we have on a weekend on QAM, especially, like the big

[02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:57.440]
show.

[02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:58.620]
Oh, he's just...

[02:03:58.620 --> 02:03:59.340]
I love to sit again.

[02:03:59.460 --> 02:03:59.920]
I like him.

[02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:00.600]
He's a good guy.

[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:01.700]
He never still afraid to him.

[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:02.260]
But he...

[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:06.120]
And it seems to me, maybe it's just my bad luck, but we have him on like all weekend long

[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:07.480]
in between the ESPN droppings.

[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:11.140]
We got about five minutes of Joe Rose and the rest it's the big...

[02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:12.980]
He must work really cheap, you know what?

[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:16.000]
Yeah.

[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:17.860]
No, he's a good guy.

[02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:20.300]
But he's just so...

[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:20.720]
Terminal.

[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:22.240]
God is he ponderous.

[02:04:22.780 --> 02:04:23.780]
Well, I'm sorry, uh-oh.

[02:04:24.020 --> 02:04:24.340]
I'm sorry.

[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:24.960]
You're a great guy.

[02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:32.180]
Starting next Monday, the Iraqi, the former Iraqi of press secretary, information minister,

[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:36.020]
whatever his title is, he's going to be doing moorings with the big QAM.

[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:38.540]
He was a panic.

[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:45.460]
The best scene of him was the last one where he was standing right by the Palestine hotel.

[02:04:46.180 --> 02:04:46.180]

[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:47.800]
And don't be afraid.

[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:48.680]
Don't be afraid.

[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:49.700]
There's nothing going on here.

[02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:50.800]
We have everything on the control.

[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:52.900]
And you can see the gunfire in the back.

[02:04:52.900 --> 02:04:54.660]
I can't believe I was a smoking behind him.

[02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:55.320]
Don't be afraid.

[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:55.920]
I'm not afraid.

[02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:57.060]
There's everything on the control.

[02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:58.040]
We will kill them all.

[02:04:58.140 --> 02:04:59.240]
We will tear out their hearts.

[02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:01.780]
It was just incredible.

[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:04.540]
I guess you knew how to say the right things to stay alive.

[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:05.580]
Right.

[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:07.500]
Here's for Lauderdale.

[02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:07.760]
Hello?

[02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:09.580]
Hello?

[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:10.440]
Yes, sir.

[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:12.160]
Uh, dear field.

[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:14.480]
I like to say, here's dear field beach.

[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:15.140]
Okay.

[02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:18.020]
Hey, uh, is Michael Moore a frugget like you?

[02:05:18.460 --> 02:05:18.640]
Yeah.

[02:05:19.340 --> 02:05:20.560]
His wife thinks so too.

[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:22.580]
Same as the guy from Naples.

[02:05:22.980 --> 02:05:24.720]
That's no deal going around here from dear field.

[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:26.380]
That was a matter of fact.

[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:27.080]
He's very heterosexual.

[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:29.100]
I know that has a lot to do with Martin Sheen.

[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:29.620]
Is he a fact?

[02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:29.940]
No.

[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:31.500]
And Susan Sarandon, she a dyke.

[02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:32.600]
No, and Tim Robbins.

[02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:34.300]
Same thing.

[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:36.520]
And there is our first pro war call.

[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:38.160]
I'm so proud of you, sir.

[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:39.160]
I'm so proud.

[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:43.000]
I'm as pleased as punch that another guy that disagrees with me.

[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:44.580]
That's the best he can do, you know?

[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:46.940]
It's come up with his great shot.

[02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:48.700]
This great attack of your game.

[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:49.080]
Wow.

[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.120]
Do you know how many straight people they have here in Toronto?

[02:05:53.620 --> 02:05:54.580]
About third man.

[02:05:54.820 --> 02:05:55.500]
I think you're right.

[02:05:57.840 --> 02:05:58.960]
That's the great attack.

[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:00.000]
Is he a fag too?

[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:01.540]
No, Michael Moore is very happily married.

[02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:02.240]
Is what he told me.

[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:03.920]
And his book is still like hotcakes.

[02:06:04.180 --> 02:06:06.220]
And he's got the balls to tell exactly like it is.

[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:09.240]
But you continue go stepping along, pal.

[02:06:10.300 --> 02:06:11.580]
We'll be the first ones to come there.

[02:06:11.620 --> 02:06:13.080]
You'll be big and first to get your ass out.

[02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:14.200]
And the answer will be, no.

[02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:16.260]
Now, have a good time on the inside.

[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:19.060]
Hey, do you have $2,000 or more on a credit card?

[02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:20.880]

Thank you, Beast. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Now our next judge needs no introduction.

[02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:44.260]
I'm sure you're all aware of our wonderful morning show.

[02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:47.060]

So I can get out of here and go home.

[02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:57.440]
All right, give me the goddamn envelope.

[02:07:57.880 --> 02:07:58.960]
Here you are, Mocha!

[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:02.980]
And the winner is Betz-Lorette number one.

[02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:05.120]
OK, Beast, I am the beast.

[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:06.640]
You fat little toy.

[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:08.120]
Behind that curtain is your date.

[02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:09.980]
Is it going to be Betz-Lorette number one?

[02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:13.120]
Oh, let me say number one.

[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:13.800]
I had figures.

[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:15.240]
You can't think we're all that fat.

[02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:16.360]
Wait a minute.

[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:17.580]
Oh, you want the pot of the beer?

[02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:18.540]

[02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:20.540]

[02:08:20.540 --> 02:08:21.500]
Number one.

[02:08:21.620 --> 02:08:22.460]
I got your mind.

[02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:23.080]
Move your feet.

[02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:23.800]
Move your feet.

[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:25.360]
We did it all for our best.

[02:08:26.020 --> 02:08:26.740]
All right, Beast.

[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:28.220]

[02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:31.720]
Sport hole radio program director, Clarence.

[02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:34.760]
I was hoping you'd pick me.

[02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:36.720]
Well, I always thought you were trying to cute.

[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:38.800]
Maybe later we can talk about sports.

[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:40.180]
You said sports.

[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:42.660]
Stop it, Clarence.

[02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:43.600]
I am the beast.

[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:44.800]
Then you're fighting my arm.

[02:08:45.060 --> 02:08:45.380]
Stop it.

[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:46.460]
All right, you two mother-heads.

[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:47.100]
Look at all.

[02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:48.120]
Hit the back of the man.

[02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:48.840]

Now I got to escort you.

[02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:54.740]
Something to date to the crazy horsey-sour stripped.

[02:08:55.340 --> 02:08:56.220]
Here we are, kids.

[02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:57.660]

[02:09:09.380 --> 02:09:09.740]
What was that?

right and to claim that we care so much about the Iraqi people

[02:40:08.850 --> 02:40:14.550]
they're so pressed and whatnot when the UN did a report on those sanctions

[02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:18.150]
and in the last 10 years 500,000 children

[02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:23.070]
starve to death right that's correct based on those sanctions from the US

planning some you know it's funny yeah as a matter of fact

[02:44:02.890 --> 02:44:05.670]
word that's what we're going to Syria now we're sure that they moved him over

[02:44:05.670 --> 02:44:10.630]
the boy probably I like to listen to both sides liberal talk radio conservative

[02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:14.510]
but it's funny when I listen to like Russia something oh that is funny it is

[02:44:14.510 --> 02:44:18.850]
funny but he actually turned me into more of a moderate because I used to be

[02:44:18.850 --> 02:44:21.330]
pretty conservative but when everything that went wrong on the face of the

[02:44:21.330 --> 02:44:25.370]
planet was built Clinton's fault panel yeah lost its legitimacy and then of

[02:44:25.370 --> 02:44:27.910]
course when Bill and Hillary were killing all those people those little babies

[02:44:27.910 --> 02:44:31.770]
you know yeah it's funny how they're talking about this this left wing hatred for

[02:44:31.770 --> 02:44:34.450]
Bush what about when Clinton was in there wasn't there a little bit of a

[02:44:34.450 --> 02:44:38.350]
right wing yeah I haven't I mean I have seen a couple of input and peach Bush

[02:44:38.350 --> 02:44:41.330]
uh bumper stickers and there was that little movement that never got off

[02:44:41.330 --> 02:44:43.930]
the ground but I haven't seen that Congress trying to impeach the president

[02:44:43.930 --> 02:44:47.730]
yet for an illegal invasion yeah it's just you know it's sad because I listen to

[02:44:47.730 --> 02:44:52.490]
you and it's such vitriol from both sides I mean you know such hatred from both

[02:44:52.490 --> 02:44:55.310]
that you know they're the right wing Nazis and there's the left wing

[02:44:55.310 --> 02:44:59.370]
commie pink goes I mean it just gets to be nonsensical after while I mean if

[02:44:59.370 --> 02:45:02.970]
Gore would have won the election would have been legitimate then no

[02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:07.050]
absolutely not but I don't think if Gore would have won the election we wouldn't

[02:45:07.050 --> 02:45:10.690]
have done it because Gore wasn't supported by the by the Nazis as you call him

[02:45:10.690 --> 02:45:13.270]
who are behind this president Richard Purlink I don't know the new with Gore

[02:45:13.270 --> 02:45:15.970]
neither does Wolfowitz or your Rumsfeld or Cheney Rand those people

[02:45:18.190 --> 02:45:22.050]

[02:45:43.390 --> 02:45:46.590]
premises you know that the forces pulling the strings in the government are

[02:45:46.590 --> 02:45:51.210]
closing down on all those great websites we've become a custom too well we still

[02:45:51.210 --> 02:45:55.950]
have the US Postal Service to rely on so now at the time to join the Nazi of the

[02:45:55.950 --> 02:46:01.210]

[02:46:31.050 --> 02:46:36.970]
cooperation between Syria on these points and he indicated the same kind of warnings that we've

[02:53:10.950 --> 02:53:15.990]
today he was talking about that bitch that they put in charge with the reconstruction of a rack

[02:53:15.990 --> 02:53:22.710]
right okay there was a real good uh documentary done about the heroes with a world trade center

[02:53:23.350 --> 02:53:29.390]
the guy who was the in charge of security for the towers he was one of the former FBI agents that

[02:53:29.390 --> 02:53:36.290]
were sent to Yemen right and he died on the one right right and he was the one that got him

[02:53:36.290 --> 02:53:41.950]
taken off the case in Yemen because he was putting a lot of pressure on it right we we talked

[02:53:41.950 --> 02:53:47.050]
about that at the time you know it was unbelievable that she was the one that it was responsible

[02:53:47.050 --> 02:53:52.430]
for the night right happening in the first place right it was it was just disgusting and then

[02:53:52.430 --> 02:53:58.150]
to know that she's going to be in charge of trying to rebuild all that stuff it's very

[02:53:58.670 --> 02:54:03.590]
if she's going to be in the equivalent to the mayor of Baghdad right it's just crazy and that guy

[02:54:03.590 --> 02:54:08.890]
he had a chance to get out of the building but he went back up to try to get a few people she could

[02:54:08.890 --> 02:54:15.330]
get out of there and he paid for it what is life yeah so for me it doesn't make any sense anybody who

[02:54:15.330 --> 02:54:20.790]
has any type of uh like cahana you know should email the government saying we don't want this girl

[02:54:20.790 --> 02:54:25.590]
to be in charge of that she screwed up in Yemen and now what do you think she's going to do in Iraq

[02:54:25.590 --> 02:54:30.970]
well between shalabi and her and uh james woosey and all of these uh crazy people are putting a
