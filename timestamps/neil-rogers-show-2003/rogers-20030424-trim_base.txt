[00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.140]
Oh, let's hear it.

[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.320]
You think we'll get any more calls like that today?

[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.160]
But third, man.

[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.800]
When surprised me at all.

[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.500]
In what city will you find the most obnoxious people?

[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.640]
Miami 409.

[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.700]
In fact, Miami has moved over 100 votes ahead of gay paris.

[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.600]
I think you're like that.

[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.120]
409 people say Miami has the most obnoxious people.

[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.420]
They must be listening to this program.

[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.160]
Paris 306, New York 235, Volca 219.

[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.580]
Can you believe that?

[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.080]
Yeah, I believe it.

[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.900]
Volca is right on New York's ass.

[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.100]
New York City 235 votes.

[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.200]
Volca 219.

[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.220]
And that's because the losers from New York all settled in Volca and all the people, the

[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.740]
old Jews that got kicked out of the beach got moved up to Volca.

[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.460]
All we can say about Volca is, better than me.

[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.480]
And then it's way down to Philadelphia 44.

[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.920]
I guess the word familiar with this last guy, I call this flyers guy.

[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.300]
Hey, are you and Bobby Clark?

[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.220]
I hope you have a long and happy relationship, OK?

[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.740]
Only he wants to the top.

[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.940]
Philly 45, Washington DC 22, Tampa 15, Greenwich, Connecticut 10, Snotstale, Arizona 7, Atlanta,

[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.060]
Georgia, and Oakland, California, and Detroit, each have six.

[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.900]
Moscow 3 and Vienna, Austria 3 out of home, just under 13 of votes.

[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.180]
How many people do you think have been to Austria in our vast audience?

[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.360]
Top 3 man.

[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.920]
Yeah, that's probably an exaggeration.

[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.180]
Although those Austrians, Van, they sure liked it all a goose step, you know?

[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.540]
Yeah.

[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.080]
They always liked Adolf a lot.

[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.120]
In fact, they probably even used Adolf's meat tenderizer on their, huh?

[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.740]
What's your thing?

[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.940]
That's what John Jarrah said.

[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.880]
Wouldn't surprise me under V&E sausages.

[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.640]
They probably tenderize it with Adolfs.

[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.980]
All of us, all of us, all of us, all of us.

[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.560]
That's lovely.

[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.440]
Everybody put on those shit boots, baby.

[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.040]
Get ready to do step with George W.

[00:01:49.040 --> 00:02:18.840]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:02:48.840 --> 00:03:18.560]
Because she said you don't ever do a lick work Which of these things do you care about the least? Scott Lacey Peterson, Stanley Cup playoffs, Arbitron radio ratings, tomorrow by the way Florida, Marlins, Mohawer, David, and Georgia's sex fantasies, harness racing or politics I think that's a really interesting mix, you know, kind of like mix and snap amount There's eight interesting choices on there and we're not adding anything on to it Okay, this is not one we need any more of your assistance on us Some of those kind of a pulls that's it

[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:30.740]
The pull is closed So once you put it on the Eric, that's it. Don't have it in fact he can go off and have himself a nice big brunch Get himself all bucked up and ready for the pressure tomorrow's ratings coming out tomorrow's the big rating show boy

[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.060]
Oh, and a pressure is building heavy duty man, and smell it all the way up here

[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.840]
Come in to Q.I.M.

[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.000]
Hey Uncle Miel. Yes, sir. Oh, hi, Uncle Miel, first of all, I have the flyers

[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.960]
Secondly, and by the way, one, when you get the little eyes and their bits the eyes

[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.200]
things on the website

[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.380]
When Eric gets around to it when he feels like it

[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.640]
Oh

[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.740]
Hey, Uncle Miel, I love your buddy. You show awesome George

[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.600]
Okay, thanks. He don't like you George. Yeah, I know. It's too bad that I gave Carlos all those eyes and her bits

[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.140]
I'm gonna go take them back now. Why is that okay?

[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.340]
I want some see there he goes playing fast and loose with your emotions here just because you said George suck

[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.420]
That's right. I'm gonna put it in here. What if I'd George Licks he'd elected a lot better

[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.960]
I shouldn't be saying this Sabrina. No, no, she took off. She's a big editor. I don't want to hear what a pervert you are

[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:31.440]
Wt. Q.I.M. Good morning, Neil. How you doing sir? When is this amigo?

[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.940]
It's strange how the only

[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.540]
That was found behind the walls there was US currency

[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.440]
Were there any rubles? Were there any Franks were in the Dutch mocks?

[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.340]
They haven't got to those banks yet

[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.520]
But it just seems that we weren't supposed to be doing any trading with

[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.920]
I hear Rimmel was thinking of cutting shortest trip to Toronto so I could go over there

[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.640]
Heard there were a lot of free diners floating around

[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.240]
Yes, there are

[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:10.580]
But it just it just getting to be ridiculous. I was just listening to NPR before and it just the antagonism and just anything

[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:17.780]
That this government is doing that this administration is doing it just like all the countries that didn't go along with them

[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.320]
They're not signing trade accords

[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.080]
They're trading now an hour and now cool and policies. We're gonna stick into the French pretty soon

[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.960]
We're gonna be a war with the whole world. It's gonna be you us against them

[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.620]
That's what it is already. It's just getting to be so ridiculous, Neil and how far is the peace bridge?

[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.540]
Have a good trip, pal

[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.680]
Just be prepared for a long wait if customs. That's all I can tell you okay

[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.400]
They're gonna take their tent of your temperature not just in your ear, but in your rectum rear

[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.180]
You know they have that little thing where they stick it in your rear they do that's what my office concerned about

[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.520]
He said he's gotta go back to the doctor. He's getting them all kinds of tests

[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.200]
We got a lot of sick people of Q.A.M

[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.160]
Boy, thank goodness even on the middle of the SARS-Belt up here

[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.900]
I think I'm a lot safer and in much better health. I'm on him here down there

[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.260]
That's a report I had this morning everybody's gagging and coughing room where I'm hearing is that Dave Hagen spread

[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.900]
SARS all over the Q.A.M building that's a number. We heard

[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.260]
12 minutes after nine at five sixty WQM many many times

[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.340]
I'm sure in your lifetime you've passed up the opportunity that was a really good chance and just didn't reach out and grab it

[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.300]
Well right now is one of those times so get your hand all warmed up and grab this one

[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.240]
Interest rates have gone down even lower the financial group was offering interest rate of 3.45 percent

[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.100]
Then they lowered it to 2.95 percent now rates have gone down even lower

[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.500]
2.45 percent financing waiting on you with financial group

[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.920]
Let me say it again 2.45 percent amazing so call financial group and check this out call

[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.080]
189 for O-Lend and of course these interest rates probably are can last very long

[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.320]
So this is a window of opportunity waiting for you that you ought to hop through with financial group get yourself that incredibly

[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.400]
Low rate of just 2.45 percent and save thousands of dollars a zillion bucks. How do I drive careful on the way home?

[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.540]

1809 for O-Lend

[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.520]
L.A.N.D. That was George speaking. I have just totally ignored them

[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.300]
What will 2.45 percent financing due to those monthly payments? You're probably wondering well if you have a

[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.560]
$200,000 alone your payments are just

[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.740]
$786 bucks a month if you have a hundred thousand dollar loan you pay only three ninety three a month

[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.660]
So do it now do you stuff a big favor and save a lot of cash call financial group toll free

[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.480]
The Inequal Housing Lender credit restrictions apply rates are subject to change without notice 5.34 APR

[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.140]
If there's a button I smell it I'm infectious

[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.380]
I'm so old my friend

[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:57.060]
Another bird they come around my friend. I'm infectious. I celebrate my sit-around token with my friends

[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.200]
I can't wait to roll another one again

[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:07.180]
I guess I'm old my friend. I'm infectious. What is that wacky can of this my friend?

[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.980]
I can't stop. Some of my soul will it feel so young again?

[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.260]
And I can't wait to roll another one again. I'm infectious. I'm so old my friend

[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:24.140]
But I still like the weed that sets me sideways. Oh right. I grow Mexican

[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.840]
It's planted right up at my side my driveway. Jesus Christ doing it my way

[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:37.440]
Yes, I'm old my friend. I'm infectious. What I can turn my brain to toast again

[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:45.420]
So grab a phone and torture fat one of my friends and I can't wait to roll another one again

[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.000]
You're watching it wait for another birthday again

[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:51.500]
Oh

[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.980]
918 at 560 that we might play that 20 30 times today you know about 30

[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.480]
Okay, I'm serious. That's great. I love that and what I love even better was I'm infectious

[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.700]
How come I just it just dawned on me that I guess because it wasn't as appropriate before it is now

[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.280]
Right, so I take back what I said about poor Dave Hagen who never stole a freight train. He's not a bad guy

[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.460]
But rumor here and now from inside the building those inside sources that we have

[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.040]
I say in that all these sick people around the QM building got it from one guy

[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.240]
Say I told you probably from an hair piece, you know

[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.100]
If he'd if he'd worse that thing once every few months

[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.360]
Maybe wouldn't be spreading around all kinds of vermin and disease inside the building

[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.760]
I'm in section right they're gonna have to put up a they're gonna have to quarantine his old ass in boca

[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.140]
Can you imagine and from what we saw in that boy yesterday probably deservedly so

[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:42.340]
This is an interesting fact from a really weird guy Teddy in Kendall to see this which one

[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.480]
When you just sent me oh, yeah

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.440]
I mean it's all over the place, but he's harmless he means well

[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.300]
Neal and trained mucky's another guy trying to be a comedian, you know, I'm like most of our audience. They want to be funny

[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.320]
Neal and trained mucky looks like Moe finally dropped that bomb on you. I thought I spelled something

[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.340]
I figured it out after seeing that you'll be forced to stay in Toronto for at least three weeks thanks to the W-8. Oh

[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.240]
He said he I hate to break the news to you, but nobody is forced to stay anywhere

[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.000]
But I'll be more than delighted to be here for three weeks for three years. It's fine with me

[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:19.720]
Moe went to China a few weekends ago and got raked it by a pig who got bit by a weird mosquito and vibe the spread this new disease all the way to Toronto

[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.240]
I'm in Texas. He was obviously successful with the suck ass Roger syndrome suckers

[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.520]
Not bad Teddy

[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.780]
According to the hero you are now a great risk of transmitting locally

[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.200]
So stay away man, and I will be more than happy to

[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.640]
Blige you with that by the way who is Remus and his blue bird. This is sad, you know

[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.540]
I've seen practically every Disney movie and can't come up with it or the characters faces either says Teddy

[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.040]
Remus we talked about this before is from the song of the south. What is wrong with you man?

[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:57.680]
Zipedy dude does zipedy a how come remus is acting so gay. Hey lunch remember that

[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.640]
Of course I do one of my favorites

[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.300]
Well these people what the hell do they know what that okay?

[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.300]
Our poll is up already new poll is there

[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.420]
Which of these things do you care about the least the least

[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.100]
harness racing eight scott lacy Peterson six

[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.640]
See how many votes we got on the poll so far about third man

[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.520]
harness racing eight scott lacy Peterson six Georgia's sex fantasy six

[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.220]
Moe Howard David and the Florida marlins tied with a forward. I have a lot of common nobody cares about either one of them

[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:38.740]
Arbitron radio ratings one stand the couple playoffs one and politics none out of the first 30 votes. I think it's very interesting

[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:44.760]
What that that tape that we're gonna play a little bit the audio from it? Mm-hmm that Randy Rhodes tape

[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.280]
That and back if you listen because you weren't paying that much attention to the content just more like what everybody looked like

[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.980]
But I was promoting the marlins back in those days

[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.420]
So with the early days of the marlin franchise when we really you over trying to be supportive and went to a lot of games

[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.580]
And we're going home and yadda yadda right and then of course

[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.000]
First it was Wayne and then it was John Henry and now this bunch of elunatics

[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.860]
Well pretty much turned everybody off on it nobody cares anymore

[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.620]
I see they have an and the now it's crab is just over 9,000 for their stunning

[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.500]
Extruding victory last night against the umptuous milwaki brewery just a little bit over 9,000

[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.440]
What was the weather like last night?

[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.100]
Just fine. Just fine. It was just fine. You know, oh we're fine

[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:27.340]
I say and yet the barely barely overnight probably like about seven or eight really tops in the stadium

[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.980]
Stigging that you can't even find a name of a business that's still in business

[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:33.480]
WQAM

[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.160]
Can we suck your ass out?

[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:44.120]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Marles on that's what's his name by the way Eddie?

[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:52.360]
No, that's uh, that's the whispering guy the contrary guy idea, but that's Eddie. All right. This is new stick WQAM

[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.200]
Yeah, I think the unglent what we're doing in Iraq

[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:57.960]
No brother

[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.820]
That must be one of joys old people. That's not like the

[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.140]
The billy again, didn't it? It's not like the billy

[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.960]
Keep them coming baby get those phones smoking we want to talk to 50,000 wackos here today

[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.740]
That's what it's all about Bruce Springsteen on free speech

[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.860]
The boss has a message for all you dixie chicks haters out there shame on you and by the way the dixie chicks

[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.340]
Even though they're single the sales dropped off the face of the globe their album is still number one on the country charts

[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.580]
Right, they're still selling out they're still selling out their concerts

[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:31.560]
But anyway, he says shame on you. That's what the boss says argue dixie chick haters out there

[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.360]
Bruce Springsteen probably America's most prominent symbol of rock and roll patriotism

[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:42.500]
Uh, who exploited of course 9-11 for all he could recently posted the following statement by Bruce Springsteen.net

[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.860]
If you don't believe me you can look it up for yourself if somebody will spell it for you

[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:52.080]
The dixie chicks have taken a big hit lately for exercising their basic right to express themselves

[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.660]
To me their terrific American artist expressing American values by using their American right to free speech

[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.640]
For them to be banished wholesale from radio stations and even entire radio networks for speaking out is un-American

[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.560]
It is un-American and oh we're fine and unbelievable there you go get the right one

[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.160]
The pressure coming from the government and big business to enforce conformity of thought

[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.600]
Concerning the word politics goes against everything that this is country is about namely freedom. That's what the boss says

[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:23.680]
Right now we're supposedly fighting to create free speech in Iraq at the same time that some are trying to intimidate and

[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.540]
Punish people for using that same freedom here at home. I don't know what happens next

[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:33.600]
But I do want to add my voice to those who think the dixie chicks are getting a raw deal and an un-American one to boot and I send them my support

[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.900]
Let's hear it for the boss. He can't sing for crap

[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:37.960]
That's something

[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.140]
Yeah, let's hear it for the boss. Okay

[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.520]
Who at least has got the balls to stand up and tell them like it is even though you can't think for sh**

[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.380]
We know that he shouts and pufs a lot. He's a screamer

[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.600]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.880]
What if they're playing the dixie chicks on kisser won't they tell us they'll be Q a m?

[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.900]
Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir

[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.040]
Can you play the goldie taste please? Oh, I was gonna say could this be a real caller? It's not

[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.480]

[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:17.660]
Neil yes, sir. You're real caller or just another night? I'm a real caller. I'm on my way to Vegas today

[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.040]

[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:24.460]
Come on first time get out of town. I'm getting that out of this town

[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:29.060]
That's that's what I meant a question for you my wife wants me to spend all this freaking money on these shows

[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.920]
This Danny Gens this pet and telecraft is it worth doing that?

[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.180]
Is that waste of money only if she goes alone ship her ass off to it and when meantime you have a great time

[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.620]
That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Take over a couple of cocktail wait for season just dump the bitch

[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.080]
Exactly, it's a waste of money than you're saying

[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.800]
I didn't say that if you like that if you like shows that the best shows in the world aren't Vegas

[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.640]
Yeah, do you like them? No, I hate him. I don't want to see much of swishy magicians

[00:15:54.640 --> 00:16:01.100]
And what do you do out there? What's your favorite thing to do out there? Gamble my gamble and eat eat and gamble gamble and eat

[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.400]
I'm gonna eat my ass off and gamble your ass off

[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:10.700]
Yeah, I thank you. Have a great time man. Go on to Vegas for the first time now. Let's see. What are you like? How do you attack the befasin Vegas?

[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.740]
Like forking a loud primal screen. I'm going to Vegas. How can I have a good time? Come on pal

[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.860]
Just hop on a plane and get going man. Just hop on that plane and get going just to walk out there

[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.980]
If you need directions how to have a good time in Vegas then it's time for the question

[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.600]
We'll light with a fully loaded weapon. Okay with a fully loaded piece

[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:37.020]
Do they have any good convenience stores out there? I already got some dynamite 7-elevens with a big neon signs and everything the likes of which you've never seen even the Mac

[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:42.560]
Donals out there the big golden arts the M is like all glittery and lit up really exciting. Don't eat the food there though

[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.960]
Can you imagine people to go to Vegas and eat at fast food restaurant that

[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.460]
Of that there ought to be capital punishment for that even if you're not in favor of the death penalty

[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.300]
I think we'll make a exception on that for those bleeding hearts out there

[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.760]
And we'll bring back old Sparky for that somebody that would eat that would be like

[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:06.980]
Going to a Boston and eating at the Kentucky fried or something like that place. It's got so many great restaurants

[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.680]
Let's run room service at the MGM. You don't never even need to leave the MGM the room service

[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.000]
They're the food essential aid that leave your room because maybe who knows what diseases are all over town

[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.620]
Yeah, let's start spreading rumors about other places

[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.340]
Not don't do that a good idea

[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.980]
But it is a thaw. I mean this WH crap boy there are foaming at the mouth up here there like apple plectic

[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.500]
This is left to come. I don't think so. I mean

[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.580]
I mean again, it's really the word economy is gonna go. Yeah, and the crapper

[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.800]
You can't complain about the tourist here in Toronto because there aren't any

[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.960]
While the rumors are coming that should add a lot to the economy

[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.000]
not

[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:48.140]

Arboros to support specific health needs from your bones to your blood pressure to your immune system

Sounds to me that a lot of folks there were QAIM could start poppins of Olimit pretty soon

[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.560]
It can't hurt got a lot of sick puppies in that place now. There are three new Olimit formulas

You're welcoming the righty-head styles

[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.300]
The hook one has been chewed back that in one day

[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:01.420]
You'll see things in a similar way if you don't stop

[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.500]
Covering terrorism if you don't stop

[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.620]
Our troops will be out here

[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.840]
Enter us clear to avoid a war

[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.460]
Where is the dumb?

[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.780]
Where is the dumb?

[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.160]
Trying to save the Valentine's Day

[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.800]
And I confess all the things that you've done

[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.620]
Listen to one America telling you

[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.900]
We'll be right back to terms of one more too

[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.020]

We'll cover in terrorism if you don't stop

[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.600]
Our troops now do you have that tape queued up?

[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.680]
Yeah such as it is. I mean you know it doesn't have to be like a VCR way well you know

[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.160]
The slow there it is

[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.780]
Old open blast in the pants that was great

[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:58.780]
Use talk radio six 10 the whole you IOD right away right to I.M. Don't you can do show to talk with the old aisle seven five one

[00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.800]
All of the old baby

[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.100]
Maybe this is when it was

[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:10.060]
We could do it. We could probably get what you like to know something and don't sell for videos

[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.800]
We're talking over great fading to you

[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.500]
Seven ahead

[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:25.440]
And another thing that I'm discovering by listening to their show is how we press I've allowed myself to become

[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.520]
Working for this company and working for a Janet and I'm working for the even buddy

[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.040]
But holier than Brent Barbary man holier than God

[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.380]
Even he's given him like enough rope to a do their thing over there

[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.880]
Now we're sitting here like oh it's easy better bleed from that the arch back and bend it

[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.340]
Neeman because we're scared cramplers and

No real costation is opposed to like you're a lady in port sure

[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.140]
Of the radio and the audience could know you're holding a mic

[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.080]
Right, oh mark in your chronic Margaret

[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.840]

Funny. Oh, man. Look at that with that light shining on his head talk about a big star talk about he could like light

[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:55.660]
We don't need the Sun forget it. He could light up the entire universe with that bald palette there man

[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.200]

[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.240]
cousin Bruce. He's got nothing on Steve Ziegler

[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:04.060]
Oh, I know some people who do I think Lisa who's won a hell of a hot looking babe

[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.280]
I think she what's wrong with that? That's a compliment

[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.380]
Everybody said you're the most beautiful woman in the building

[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:17.220]
Falling was in lovely although somewhat flat-chested but beautiful. It's just a radio show Lisa

[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.220]
God here's my behind the

[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.720]
Starline hello now I'm even with you for all those spots. Oh God. Okay, no

[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:31.040]
So this is where there's more and Mike that opinion will never change they blow they suck

[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.740]
You can hear it when you turn on the radio you hear the suction you think we're having another hurricane coming

[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.620]
That's how bad done in my car

[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.840]
Oh God, okay

[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:43.120]
So there's a little flashback from the old IOD days when we're having a really good time

[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:49.300]
We had some really good call. Did you have fun? Yeah as opposed to QM which most of the five years plus now has been like a real like

[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.800]
Like getting a root canal

[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.520]
It's just a different place and a different time and of course the fun people all moved out of town anyway

[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.940]
That's why we get every now and then over listen to you on the internet in like you know

[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:07.020]
Nina Minesha Wisconsin in Ipsilanti an any place but South Florida and of course the people left in South Florida

[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.880]
They're bitter and pissed off about it and who can blame them. This is a cute fact from listener George

[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:16.560]
Yes, we did do the Mary greasy as God married yesterday. Why is everybody bugging me with that? Hey Neil did you hear?

[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.940]
Dr. Rankins died. Yeah, Maris greasy as God married when 19 year old Holy oh yes

[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.980]
We did get that but listener George has got a very interesting thing here. It says

[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:33.460]
Is asked yet is the world still spinning around how many people are croaking from which disease this week and what do we get?

[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:39.780]
Well, Amarlins what a throwing up extra in a game last time. Oh my God. It's Greg Wheat again. No, it's a

[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.140]
Fun for the people minded

[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.940]
See that's what happens when you play too much comedy

[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.640]

We'll give you the office number the direct line to muff he can say all about Key West

[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:16.780]

[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.200]
His lungs and his heart and his

[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.160]

[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.440]
I was explaining them how they do that colonoscopy

[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.800]

[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:03.340]
According to the first major study looking weight and cancer mortality and if you're fat and you smoke well forget about it

[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:10.380]
Okay, all you can say is that's whom we're gonna be liver prostate and ovarian cancers were linked to obesity for the first time and

[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.080]
Mm-hmm see what I'm saying right

[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.280]
So we shouldn't say fetus

[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.880]

In reference to a call yesterday who said that they thought you worked better alone

[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.900]
Yeah, you gotta do a poll and see if the audience likes it better

[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:31.600]
Would you just your voice or if they'd like to hear that girl in the background the cackles all the time. Yeah

Okay, well it's not and we like to have polls that have several choices on them not just to something like that

[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.680]
But you can certainly call it and voice your hate pit of juret. I mean your opinion on that

[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.000]

And actual real good rock on the rock and roll on the FM stations and come back to this town

[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:50.620]
And as you said many many years there was not a standard market in the country with worst choice of radio

[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.480]
Yeah, this market right here was horrible

[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:57.200]
I mean I had two great days of listening outstanding music and then you get back here and it's like forget about

[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:01.680]
There's nothing on the radio, but at least you know where you are anyway and finally while I was out there

[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.060]
I think I turned out with a time difference

[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:07.000]
I was around eight o'clock watching the today show or something. I don't know if anybody talked to you about this jack

[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.780]
Thompson's on I'm like a national show

[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:14.500]
Be ready to be rating the video games now the video games are being told about the computer games

[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:19.040]
Oh, what are they ever going to give him a rock between the many-year-old and the today show they have an obsession

[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:23.680]
We've been hearing about this guy since I've listened to you since 88 and I've been hearing about him since pretty much then

[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.440]
And now he's got a national forum to spew his crap. Well, that's the media for you

[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:31.200]
They just keep retreading the same old tired voices man over and over again. Hey, man

[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.360]
Hi, hey, palmy. Hey, healthy. See you in Vegas. Bye-bye

[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:40.000]
1013 at 560 WQM. How do you like that? I wonder if he was talking to Matt. Hey, Matt. Well, Matt

[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.960]
1013 I already said that denying 560 WQ any you can never give the 10 too many times a lot more information today

[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:55.500]
And so as it stands the cases that were exported. Oh this bitch from the w8. Oh, get out of here honey

[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.600]
You're really screwing us over here in teo man

[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.240]
We're really pissed off and parked up about it. It was the other way around pissed up and parked down

[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.660]
God what a bunch of idiots

[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:09.740]

[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:40.160]

Make a pass with my bad ass sitting down watching the news

[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:06.460]
I just don't want to use my brain or the fillet by old years

[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.180]
I

[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:21.400]
Like a fox and friends I believe they're my friends and they really care about me

[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.660]
I know it's true

[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.420]
The same

[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.800]
I

[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:43.960]
My nose that they're in the wife house has a group of me so the Lord

[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:51.440]
I love my job my money's gone. That's what I blame plenty for

[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:55.920]
They came for my family

[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.860]
I say it's not a great

[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.540]
But I have nothing to hide

[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.520]
So I should be all right

[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.000]
Until they come for me

[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.500]
I know it's true

[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.260]
Good thing

[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:17.860]
I'm sorry

[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:24.880]
I got the

[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:27.320]
And

[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.020]
Thanks

[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:28.940]
Be

[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:49.540]
Don't forget our hot couples contest go to the arrangers.com and check it out. You'll see the flaming things on there

[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.980]
I noticed that Carlos did you put that on there?

[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.900]
Put which one no

[00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:58.660]
Those flames

[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.900]
Yes, what is your story to understand you're a little under the weather but you're you know

[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:11.820]
Sorry, I was putting up another story after after a month a pin them up against the wall a couple of days ago and given that Hickey on a neck

[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.840]
Having the next thing and oh we got these flames shooting up there the hot hot couples contest too

[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:23.240]
And go on or you might win a trip for two to the Bahamas including air for three days and two nights is netted

[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.160]
That's it there you go

[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:29.700]
We're gonna do that for three months in a row starting me one. Have we got any pictures yet? Yeah, we do

[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:33.260]
Would you like me to forward them? Are there any buddy interesting? Yeah

[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:38.160]
It was how George always has to see him first. He has to like prove it

[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:42.740]
I didn't see him first. They were forwarded to me. What are you talking about? I am to see you. I mean Carlos sensitive

[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.620]
From now on

[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.940]
When the buzzer when us with a sensitivity is gonna be like a little bulb goes off

[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:55.660]
And George just sets it off. It's gonna be automatic very very sensitive and thin skin

[00:42:55.660 --> 00:43:02.180]
Well, you won't like what you already read this because you fax him to me John and Kansas City says George tosses salad. Yeah

[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:06.840]
So it says George tosses salad baseball is a wonderful game

[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.880]
But sound float is not a wonderful place. It's not to serve a major league team

[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:15.580]
I started blue jays played in Tampa last night. I believe they lost again, but they had like a very small crowd

[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.520]
Over there in Tampa

[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.980]
It was incredible. You could have had your own section

[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.220]
Anyway, John says I like hockey, but we don't understand all the nuances of the game yet

[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:30.000]
For instance, I don't see what makes people talk about how good Nicholas Lidstrom is misspelled

[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:35.620]
Well, just because he happens to be probably the best defenseman in the game or certainly one of the best two or three

[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:39.420]
That's probably why I don't understand the plus minus that I wonder why the panthers suck so much

[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.760]
It's called bad personnel

[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:45.580]
Lack of talent just like the Leafs lack of talent also keen sucks suck suck

[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:54.200]
I love Mosho when he and Kelly get into deep philosophical discussions concerning the ethics of recycling a dead animal spur the randlings of an idiot John and Kansas City good job John

[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.120]
Nice. Come on baby. That's the way we like it

[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:03.100]
Too much serious heavy duty stuff and here's our great facts and and because then of course it's signed dick some dick

[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:08.720]
Fony name, but because this person took so much effort to write this lengthy thing out

[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:18.060]
I think I might as well read it don't you sure it has its moments even though it just tons of mistakes since our glorious victory against the forces of darkness and Baghdad to which to go in with North Korea

[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:24.860]
And a panic over its less than Rosy economic future who exactly is North Korea to go to war against and how many days does the thing to world will last they co

[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:30.760]
How about South Korea how about so what are seven million people but anyway the coalition can now cast a John this I had our neighbor to the North

[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.280]
a

[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:38.000]
As each sneeze induced booger missile of mass destruction increases the fear of plague in Toronto when the worldwide

[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.380]
Economic community the each each sneeze induced booger missile

[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.440]
That's a great line

[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:49.660]
The coalition must now decide how much importance to give the stimulating Canada's flat economy

[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:55.380]
Which is also wrong for all practical purposes Canada rains a wholly on some city area of the U.S

[00:44:55.380 --> 00:45:00.480]
The USA gets most of its oil from Canada also very very well. Where the hell did that come from?

[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:05.120]
However when Iraq's Northern oil fields are back up to full production

[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:11.220]
What incentive is there for us to continue to show up the GNP of a country that's been so critical on on support of our policies in Iraq

[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.740]
Forgetting I guess about the fact that Canada's already sending people over there like to help in a cleanup work

[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.200]
Like you've all the other shleppers in the world. Yeah, we'll go up there and clean up the mess you made

[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:27.000]
Dooman gloom seems to be in the forecast for Canada each winter sees fewer and fewer knee sock sandal clad

[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:31.820]
Blobs on the boardwalk in Hollywood soon the only people with disposable incomes in Toronto will be the

[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:37.100]
Ex-papier such as you would you then put such a gleeful spin on any less than perfect news from the USA

[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:42.140]
SARS may not be the only cloud in the maple leafs future come home and save yourself Neil no

[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.420]
Frank Cuban cooking may not be the answer to the world's love of French cooking

[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:50.740]
But it sure beats the falafel and feces diet that Canada may have to eat the cola

[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:57.020]
It says the falafel and feces diet that Canada may have to wait the coalition forgives you and of course got even love Neil Roger

[00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:01.300]
And like I said a lot of mistakes in there, but it went to such lengths to put that together

[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:01.540]
Yeah

[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:10.200]
That I felt at least we had a dignified what a response like reading it five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a 18 t and t

[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.460]
In Verizon wireless line on a really nifty Thursday not bad

[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:16.740]
WQ I am

[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.340]
Hmm chronic cat driver. Where is he?

[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.140]
WQ I am

[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:27.140]

Neil yes sir. How you doing? Is this the chronic cab driver?

[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.560]
What? How you doing?

[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.960]
Okay, I'm a truck driver from

[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:41.940]
Move down Hollywood from New York City. Oh, what a bad mistake. Oh, yeah, tell me about

[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:43.700]
Uh

[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.300]
Why be able to talk to Neil is why we hang on?

[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:55.120]
Uh, where are you calling from call from Hollywood. Let's go to Hollywood. Hello. Oh, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay?

[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.400]
I just want to let you know that um

[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:04.060]
Uh, you've gotten audience here. Uh, I moved down to from New York City

[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:14.060]
To Hollywood. Yep. Bad mistake. Oh, I'm telling you about it and uh, I moved down here and these chronic collars. I tell you yeah

[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:15.100]
Uh

[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:22.880]
What can I say? It's amazing. It sounds like George Collins. You know, you say about a bush and that

[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:26.520]
Every ejaculation doesn't deserve a name, you know what I mean, right?

[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:28.360]
Don't tell that to the Pope

[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:36.160]
But it's it's uh, you know, and the way people drive down here. I came down to West Palm

[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.280]
You know, telling my car behind me with a truck

[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:44.700]
I got down here and all of a sudden nobody used the directionals anymore. I don't know what it is down here

[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:49.260]
You've watched too much NASCAR or something now the directionals here. They're done with fingers not with the lights

[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:49.940]
Yeah

[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:56.100]
Generally the middle digit. Well listen hang in there. Pals great herring from you. All right. Keep on your thing. All right

[00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:01.140]
He did say trucking didn't he? I noticed somebody said that yesterday something that sounded like that on Moe show

[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:05.380]
And he just about went apple-plugged it. He was ready to dump it and that sounded was too close to blah blah blah

[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:10.760]
This is the same guy that's talking about, you know, Gelly likes uh, whatever that guy's name is. He did dump it

[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:17.260]
He did he dumped it. It was dumped. Yep. Oh my god. I mean you could tell what the guy said it wasn't even close

[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:24.960]
He's getting really edgy now man. He's really right on edge speaking of the moral censor of South Florida must be getting to him now

[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.620]
Must be really having him a store a

[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:28.340]
Stortle panic

[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:33.380]
Well, we'll find out Saturday if he shows up at that the draft thing especially after the numbers come out tomorrow

[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.400]
1027 at 560 WDQ way and let me tell you about how you get a new mattress

[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:42.400]
You can you can get in your car and slip over to your department or betting store and you can go from one to the other

[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.800]
And you can get wasted a lot of expensive gas and time and get ripped off and wind up getting a crappy

[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.860]
mattress anyway or

[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:51.460]
You can make one simple call to dial amatric at 1 800 mattress

[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:04.220]

[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:08.760]
And I'm never disappointed because dial amatric is the best in the world at unbeatable everyday prices

Coming up tonight on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story

[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:22.400]
The startling true story of a man who wouldn't listen to his manager and ended up biting it very hard

[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.920]
He was Terence Trent Darby

[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:31.440]
You one of the college first album introducing the hard line

[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.180]
I said okay trendy New York lost boy. I don't know what the f*** it means, but go ahead

[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.540]
Terence Trent Darby's manager Chet Stools

[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:44.420]
You're looking back. I should have known the guy has three names, you know like Harry hand-strong purple grip or something

[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:47.300]
You know that pretentious upper west side we think we have British horse

[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:50.020]
With the success of his first single wishing well

[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:55.980]
Stools urge Darby not to alienate his fans with any more quote fruity-assed art crap unquote

[00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:00.200]
But Darby didn't listen his second album would completely unnoticed

[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:06.540]
It's title neither fish nor flesh a soundtrack of love faith hope and resurrection

[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:13.820]
Can you believe it? I said Terence I'm dying here. I got three kids who need toilet paper to wipe their runny asses

[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:20.600]
And you give me fish and flesh and hope and resurrection. I oughta f***ing kill you as Chet Stools home and business went into foreclosure

[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:27.120]
He begged Darby to listen to reason unmoved Darby released the third record symphony or damn

[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:32.140]
Exploring the tension inside the sweetness if I ever see this

[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:37.720]
Again, I am gonna ram his contract so far up his ass. He was going to say ass

[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:43.800]
But tonight for the first time Terence Trent Darby himself responds to accusations that he's a complete

[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:49.260]
Hey, that's a great title for an album the artist responds to accusations that he's the complete

[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.820]
Christ I need a new job

[00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:56.500]
It's a big juicy softy went liquid show business tonight on inside the behind

[00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:00.880]
1034 26 to 11 a mad dog you won you got to haunt for this afternoon at the

[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.160]
And I'm gonna take a look at this. I want to make sure I get it right hump or in the studio at three

[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.680]
Six to where you got marlins on direct 7 0 5 now. How is that possible?

[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:13.340]
I thought that was the last game of the series. Oh tonight's they're going for the sweep excuse me

[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:16.640]
Mara brewers at the marlins oughta be at least six seven thousand there tonight 7 0 5

[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:20.500]
Eddie came out on baseball from GA and Joe and mark overnight. That's the schedule

[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:25.140]
That's our agenda our sports agenda for you here on QAM where the games never stop

[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:29.680]
Both on the field and in the hallways of QAM the games never stop

[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:36.280]
5 6 7 0 5 60 I think better get this line 5 things. I don't like the way this the lay of the phone, you know

[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:38.260]
Doesn't look right

[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:43.340]
No, do you see what I'm saying? Yeah, I know it just creates like a bizarre pattern on here

[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:45.220]
And I think it affects the quality of the calls on the show

[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:49.760]
Now if we ever hire a new engineer now that we're trying to screw one of the old ones over

[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:51.000]
WQ I in

[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:53.760]

[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.100]

[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:35.000]
The most despised chronic of all time

[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:38.760]
We've already done that. Oh, yeah, I missed that day

[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.600]
How about as a request

[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:44.740]
Butterfly kisses powered up with that we were all feces at one time

[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.860]
Okay, that's it. That easy to please today

[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:51.920]
No, I don't want like a they want to set up the whole damn thing here

Just calm yourself down sir. Don't let me forget butterfly kisses. Okay, we played it in a long time right

[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:06.440]
In honor of Sabrina being there today now who else has got their kids there today now fat boy being in the hospital yesterday

[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.920]
He probably don't have his fat. I mean his family there kid curry

[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:12.240]
These are just because you know, I can't wonder the hall

[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:18.680]
Kits curry got he's got a daughter when he's got a daughter. Yeah. Well, this is bring your daughter to work day

[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.600]
Bring your child to work day they had to be unisex about it

[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:27.600]
Oh, they changed it didn't always used to be bring your daughter to work used to be and then you know that sexism so

[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:29.080]
No, it's not bringing child

[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.300]
I see

[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:34.540]
I managed his kids. They're both in college so I can see them bring them into the store the radio station

[00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:37.440]
They probably matured a little bit since those iod days anyway

[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:41.460]
I mean, they wouldn't believe that but that's a true story

[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:45.900]
He used to bring his kids when they were punks in the iod and they on a weekend and they would just tear the place up

[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:47.980]
Just trash the place true stories is

[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:51.760]
News department will be having an interest breakdown the ap wire was all screwed up

[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:55.680]
And there would be no paper in it or we just it was like our hurricane hit the damn newsroom

[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:59.980]
And just but I'm sure that they outgrew it, you know just boys being boys. Let's hope

[00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:07.060]
Oh line nine is ringing for the first time which is always a real treat on a show lately last several days WQAM

[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:11.580]
Yeah, um, you have one advertiser. I'm trying to get their phone number. How do I do that?

[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:14.480]
Uh, who is it? It's a mortgage company

[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:19.400]
Did you advertise on the O'Rodgers first mortgage america?

[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:21.900]

L-E-N-D

[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.780]
I appreciate your help. Okay, thanks

[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:41.220]
See there you go. I'll handle it when it calls George. Oh, we don't have any numbers to seal through and I get there you go right on

[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:44.820]
How he made it been fun number? No, no, no, not what we got our own people on there

[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.160]
We take care of our own sponsors, right? That's what they do it on the world famous near Roger show

[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:54.040]
It's as loaded with spots by the way. We should point that out load of what spots at a great rate is mr. Ego would say

[00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:02.940]
Oh talk about an inferiority complex. I got it has to work on a 50 watt light bulb radio station for the last 10 years

[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:06.920]
That has to yeah, you have seen that thing on Sundays. I know you don't get it do you

[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:13.620]
Get what a cable TV show mr. Ego show? No, no, oh my gosh before it's at one o'clock on

[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.360]
My cable it's like channel 19

[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:17.820]
Community cable. You must have it in Hollywood

[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:21.720]
Oh, if you ever saw that look looks like you're watching through a negative

[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.420]
And where Nick Lawrence is behind the scenes doing the camera and little brines. They're nipping it as heels

[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:34.660]
It's you have never in your life and they're like 75 spots before to show even starts

[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:39.580]
Your penis extender and vagina stimulator and it's it's a real tweet

[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.960]
You gotta see it before you cook. I'm telling you all right. All right, all right. All right things are going. Now. You better see it pretty soon

[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:47.160]
What's going around down there? And what's going around up here

[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:56.820]
Even loves neo-roder

[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:12.320]
Every piece of diamonds has been burned up for chance

[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:15.660]
This strut always palaces and blew up this yass

[00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:19.180]
No more wild dorkies on that ship for the spools

[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:21.220]
They'll be no more who's their family

[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:22.140]
St. Cruz

[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:23.640]
Good day

[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.040]
Call your brothers, could you stay?

[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:30.200]
Tell him that there's no way

[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.660]
No way they'll be going on a sweet cruise

[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:39.600]
St. St. St. got his men's little teeth and stirs

[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.100]
Hey!

[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:42.460]
What are you doing to my yacht?

[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:46.080]
All the crew could do was watch his burn

[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.660]
Hey! Watch those marches, roll up, roll away

[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:51.780]
Before we blew up any idea, it was totally sick

[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:54.620]
Now it looks even worse than the Titanic

[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:58.480]
Just one new episode came and there was heard news

[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.680]
They'll be no more who's their family

[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:01.600]
St. Cruz

[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:02.100]
Oh!

[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.620]
Good day

[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:06.220]
Call your brothers, could you stay?

[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:09.620]
Tell him that there's no way

[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:11.800]
Oh my God

[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:15.080]
No way they'll be going on a sweet cruise

[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:19.420]
St. St. St got his men's little teeth and stirs

[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:19.600]
Hey!

[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.920]
My family has been burnt

[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:25.640]
Wonder how the same will be now

[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:28.060]
I can't get out

[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:31.280]
Well, everything's the devil's husband burned up for chance

[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.860]
He's trying all the baddies in the room

[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.320]
Next fantasy, 78

[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:38.140]
Enough of the ass eating already and the armpit looking

[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:40.860]
More Howard David in 50

[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:41.960]
I beg your pardon?

[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:43.100]
armpit looking

[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:45.640]
Florida, Marlon's 39

[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:47.600]
Scott Lacey Peterson 36

[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.340]
Stanley Cup playoffs 26

[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:50.300]
Pollen Fix 9

[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:53.300]
And last, meaning they care the most about

[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:55.520]
our return radio rating 7

[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:56.740]
Which they'll get a real full run

[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:58.100]
And now we just got the NFL draft

[00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:58.860]
That's going to Eric!

[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:00.980]
It's Carlos's fault this time

[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:03.360]
He was too busy with those 85 trillion

[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.100]
Very important bedtime stories

[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.040]
Factority man!

[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.020]
Good stuff on there today

[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.940]
You really should go to neo-rangers.com

[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:10.960]
And find out what the hell is going on in the world

[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.240]
Which is going to hell on a hand basket

[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.040]
I want to do that story about the Israeli

[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:18.600]
Even though we have this is an update on the Israel-Arrakwil pipeline

[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.220]
From the Christian science monitor

[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:22.580]
Not from some liberal rag

[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:25.680]
Not from some left wing comedy pinko publication

[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:28.820]
But the very stodgy Christian science monitor

[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:29.480]
We'll get to it

[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:30.680]
And then of course that other thing

[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.040]
Which we really touched on yesterday

[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:35.200]
Bush election drive to tap 9-11 memories

[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:38.560]
Which is the reason that they're scheduling the 2004 Republican convention

[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:40.040]
Way up there in September

[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.140]
Almost a near coincide with the third anniversary of 9-11

[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:45.960]
To make it into a flag waving super-paid reattach event

[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:48.500]
Not that they want to exploit that tragedy you understand

[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:51.020]
Right! Not that they would do that for political purposes

[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:53.320]
So they can just sweep their man right back in or again

[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.880]
And don't have to fix the election again

[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:58.880]
Plus the Democrats can't find a candidate for lover money anyhow

[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.240]
That's what really makes me sick to my stomach

[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.100]
I say Jesse, let's get for Jesse Ventura

[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.760]
Of course then they'll bring out the atheist bullcrap that'll be the end of him

[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.120]
That'll be the end of him

[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:13.160]
This could be the greatest ass sucking facts

[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:13.900]
And don't put it stuck

[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.200]
And you put up, you're the greatest

[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.060]
And don't put it stuck

[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.900]
Sign David, how do you like that? Was that a man?

[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.920]
Like somebody stuck there a hoover up my ass

[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.880]
A Kirby vacuum cleaner hose, good line though

[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.840]
In fact, Muff might be able to talk to you about that

[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.580]
But he's getting ready for the colonoscopy

[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.500]
And when in doubt they do have to clean the out of me

[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.600]
Before they go delving in there, start looking around

[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:38.100]
Examining, exploring

[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.600]
See who's been there before

[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.120]
And then of course I also haven't touched yet on this one

[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:46.240]
Fox TV News Engineer charged with smuggling stolen a rack of yarn

[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.740]
That's very, very nice

[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:49.120]
All spin all day

[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:50.440]
Right

[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.620]
Who the hell are they kiddin' huh?

[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.260]
All right, wings all day

[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:57.000]
I wonder if he went to Kentucky fry like that one bit we play

[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.100]
About when it Jews attacked and had nothing but right wings

[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:02.660]
That's Fox News for you

[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.620]
And oxy moron, Fox News

[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.120]
Several members of the media and a US serviceman have been caught attempting the ship Iraqi

[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.440]
Paintings weapons and other wars souvenirs to America

[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.200]
US authorities said yesterday

[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.260]
This is from the A&P

[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.440]
Which is just as credible as if it came from law laws

[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:25.860]
At least 15 paintings go play the firearms ornamental knives, bonds and other items

[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:26.740]
Bonds

[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.280]
Bonds that mean

[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.580]
Bonds, V-O-D-S like berry bonds like Bill bonds on WSYZ and Detroit

[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:37.720]
And other items have been seized in their ports in Washington, Boston and London

[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.940]
In the past week, according to the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection

[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.540]
I wonder if Jeb Bush's wife, what was her name?

[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:44.620]
Columbia

[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:47.260]
Columbia, I wonder if she was having any of them

[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.680]
Item seized in the military case were flown to Fort Stewart, Georgia

[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:55.140]
These seizures that serve as a warning to anyone who would take advantage of the transition

[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:58.080]
Courant Meadowway and newly liberated Iraq Commissioner Robert Bonner said

[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.560]
Benjamin James Johnson, a work as an engineer for Fox News Channel, is the only person charged

[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.960]
or identified by the government

[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:10.420]
A criminal complaint filed in the US District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, charges Johnson

[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:13.240]
tried to bring 12 paintings into the US last Thursday

[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:17.700]
They were contained in a large cardboard box that was again been by Customs agents at Delas International

[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:18.580]
or Par outside Washington

[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:22.420]
And after they had filed with the criminal complaint says that Johnson who accompanied US troops to Baghdad

[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:26.640]
Gandhar up the paintings at a palace that belonged to Odae who was saying

[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:31.060]
One of Iraqi President Saddam Sons, the paintings depict Saddam and Odae and Gamora

[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:37.160]
An examination of Johnson's luggage also turned up 40 Iraqi Monterey bonds

[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.060]
and a visitor is badge from the US Embassy in Kuwait

[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:45.380]
Johnson, 27 of Alexandria, Virginia is not been arrested but is to appear before a federal magistrate next Tuesday

[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:51.160]
How do you like that? Johnson worked for six years as a satellite truck engineer for Fox

[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:56.500]
which fired him after learning it and I was thinking they sure got problems between Horado trying to give away the true positions

[01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:01.140]
and now this engineer who's like a guy that had a good can because he's bringing back artifacts

[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.660]
No facts on Fox, just artifacts

[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:08.420]

[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.420]
that they were not even at the halfway point yet is that possible? Can it not even be 11 o'clock yet?

[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.400]
It's possible

[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:21.740]
It is? I don't believe it

[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.660]

Turning on this and turning off that and did it was not this and I just came back

Just came back I see all the lines flash it again so it's something on your

And somebody down there is playing fast and lose probably back at engineering

[01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:00.500]
The Internet is still slapped huh our Internet is down over here if that has anything to do with it

[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:04.180]
Well see it always happens in an engineering room back there always goes down at the same time

[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:08.460]
That's gonna be our poll question tomorrow who goes down first and fastest screw and or the Internet

[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:10.960]
Is there any down?

[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:13.880]
Oh the rumor was he was in the building the other day was he there yesterday?

[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.100]
I didn't see him

[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:19.300]
That was what the tristradper was telling me those ex-dolph fans they stick together

[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:19.880]
Roar

[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:24.540]
He told me he said another bald headed ex-dolphin player only a big bigger one and blacker one

[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.260]
I bet you screw in had a big smile on her push

[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:31.100]
5 6 7 and look at this the phone is working again what did I tell you

[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.740]
Who said who said we don't have a prayer at QIM WQIM

[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.540]
Hey Neil yes sir how's it going?

[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:48.880]
Pretty good all right did you hear any rumors that they're gonna have a godfather for coming out no

[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.800]
Okay, you know I watched that series I've been trying to get hold of you a couple weeks

[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:55.540]
Let me ask you this who would be in it?

[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:57.780]
Hopefully Pacino is the dawn

[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:02.900]
How would he be in godfather for I'm not you mean it was be a retro thing but it went back

[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.280]
How would they make him look younger?

[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.520]
I don't know man

[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:13.220]
They killed off everybody except for Vincent everybody else in the movie is dead except for Connie and Vincent

[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:19.720]
Okay, can anyone any other people or of any significance or is still alive at the end of godfather 3?

[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.000]
Now but you always got new recruits

[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.080]
Yeah, not the same man

[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:31.560]
Yeah, didn't you find it aggravating though that in every one of those got the freaking babies crying all the time?

[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.360]
I love that series but man I got sick of the thing

[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.080]
They wanted to make your real life you know that's just how it is

[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:42.140]
You got stinkin' little babies around or crying and crapin' in your diapers things like that

[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:44.540]
Alright, you're the best. I didn't have a great thing

[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:49.360]
Little godfather intensive who's left to be in godfather 4?

[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:52.800]
You got Vincent which I'm really nauseous from him after his performance and look

[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:57.260]
And I want to say this I want to at least be consistent he had a right to be there in front of me or his greasy ass

[01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:03.140]
Is how soon just got married to that little kid but but nevertheless I thought it was it was exploitive

[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:06.980]
Who was the other one that was there was him and oh what's your name?

[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:14.940]
Oh glory as Stefan oh and even forgetting about that whole alien business in meris wcs and lazaro forgetting about that

[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:17.060]
Glory as Stefan makes me gag

[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:23.900]
Oh brother what is the deal with her she can't sing she's ugly as dog crap what's this what's the big attraction there?

[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.320]
Why forgot she's Cuban

[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.780]
We don't seem to get you guys excited

[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:32.140]
No, they'd rather they'd rather hang out with meris wcs

[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.660]
No, not the rest of her

[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:36.360]
Oh five six seven oh five sixty

[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:41.820]
Correct them pound five sixty on the 18t and Verizon wireless line we got the phone back on what more can you want?

[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:47.400]
Sonny shine. It's a beautiful day. Keep the windows seal real tight here WQ a.m.

[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.440]
I'm going to fall back on Q a.m.

[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:56.100]
Hey, no what's going on? Yes, sir. Hey add on those crank callers to your poll

[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.280]
Which of these things do you care about the least?

[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:06.740]
I can't you're least for this crank call it that they think they're important but that that see that doesn't make any sense

[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:11.640]
It doesn't fit in with the thrust of our poll. I do understand what you're saying but it doesn't make sense within the context

[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:15.480]
They are going well. That's why we move along real fast

[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.380]
Which of these things you care about the least we asked

[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:23.720]
407 votes in two and a half hours. That's pretty heavy duty carlos you follow on that?

[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:25.200]
Yes

[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:31.160]
You're not as excited about as you're supposed to be he's a little out of the weather he had really rough night last night.

[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.920]
I'm sorry. I kept rolling him over.

[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:35.640]
And that what you said that quite

[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:45.100]
Harness racing 124 which of these things do you care about the least I'll be damned that's what they want to hear about race sign and red Ross and Jim Magardi and Wally MacClamory.

[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:50.160]
Did you want to hear about that all day long? Harness right? Yeah, I could I could do it. I'm sure.

[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:58.240]
In fact, if I want to come back on I just sit and sit here done harness racing names of drivers and horses and I could be going till midnight just as Dick Fienberg.

[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:04.600]
He'll tell you you know dick. No harness racing 126 Georgia's sex fantasies 91.

[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:16.140]
Oh, Moe Howard David at 58 Florida Marlins is moving back up there 46 Scott Lacey Peterson 43 they got my vote. I don't care about them about the fetus. I don't want to hear from them.

[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:25.820]
Stanley Cup finals 31 Arbitron radio ratings 11 politics 9 and NFL drafts already got four just one honor. I think it'll do pretty well.

[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:31.700]
Although maybe not maybe we just got the sports nerds listen up. Maybe that's why we're getting such great intellectual calls.

[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:43.020]
5 6 7 0 5 with a guy from the W H. We're really pissed off about him man. He's just destroying the economy of this formally wonderful city.

[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:48.920]
I could be people in the crowd who are infected and I'll be taking the virus with them across China.

[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:54.940]
Well, this is in China and saws infections are now being reported from almost every province in China.

[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.520]
And that's a clear don't go to China George unless you have to.

[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:05.460]
Okay, if you want great Chinese just go to the animal post you don't have to get on the plane go all the way to China and whatever you do don't go to Hong Kong.

[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:08.220]

[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:07.500]
Hey, no soft men. Where's karaoke singer in the world? Is he really? Oh my lord. Where was he doing this? I can't imagine Phil Saltsman singing karaoke.

[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:14.560]
He did Frank Sinatra and it sounded just absolutely for it. Sounded like Frank probably sounds today.

[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:20.660]
Right. That's the order. Okay. Thanks for the good news. Phil Saltsman. I'd challenge him when Calder opens up.

[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:26.260]
If they ever open up again and Phil's calling him races. I challenge Phil to start singing karaoke in the middle of one of the races. That would be great.

[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:31.060]
If he died of my I'll go for that. So next time you're at Calder, let me know how it works out.

[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:39.480]
Best regards to our good close personal friends. Phil Saltsman. He's a good guy. In spite of some of the people he stuck in his seats at the hockey game around me. In spite of that.

[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:42.880]
How's your friend big Al doing? Oh, my buddy.

[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:57.560]
What's your name? David. Q. I. Am. Yeah. I said, then hi to Neil. I beg your pardon. Hi to hi to Neil. Sure. Go ahead. Hello. Oh, hi. New. Yes, sir. How you doing there? Hey, I'm watching these video of these crazy.

[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:07.540]
She likes riding in Iraq for us to get the hell out. They're not riding. They're celebrating. Man. They're having a good time. They're pounding themselves on the chest. They're flagulating it.

[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:14.720]
So we spend billions of dollars and sacrifice so many of our young people so that we can liberate these crazy nuts who hate our cars.

[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:21.280]
We didn't spend any money to liberate anybody. So you better get it right. We went in there so we could take control of the place and we could set up our own puppet government.

[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:33.700]
And they said, we don't think so. Just like you try to set up the shot in Iran, the same crazy Shiites to do the same thing in Iraq that they didn't Iran and put their own Ayatollah in there is what they want to do. That's what they got in my and we don't know whether a screen read of an ant because we weren't prepared for it.

[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:41.380]
As usual, we weren't prepared for it. It's a nice move by boy. Man, everything. You've got to reverse my the touch. Everything he touches.

[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:47.560]
Yeah. Well, I'll tell you one thing. You remember that expression Bush league. Now we know where it came from. We used to think it came from South Florida.

[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:55.100]
And by the way, Hank, you weren't the first one who said that I was. I don't like when he starts stealing my material, but he's certainly entitled. I was not for doing it.

[01:12:55.100 --> 01:13:01.920]
I don't know who's anyway. Not yet. Well, you should mention him that fat boys in the hospital. We don't want to see Hank follow him because Hank's in denial.

[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:14.700]
Just like a Samson and Delilah. He's in denial. Wasn't the Liler with a clear Patrick. Well, I get confused. Five, six, huh? Seven.

[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:24.020]
See Carlos, but he's doing again. I saw gaslight a couple of times. I said again recently. Just as a reminder. So I'll get the telltale signs when you're trying to drag me crazy.

[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:29.480]
Try to drive me off the deep end. I feel a lot like Ingrid Bergman today, although you don't sound at least bit like Charles Boyet.

[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:38.580]
I tried to. Don't sound don't talk in French. Okay. It's not in these days. Although I didn't joke my French toast two days ago. But I was good. Man, didn't even make me sick.

[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:51.380]
I mean, stop and think about how childish that is now stupid. It is the playing cards and the freedom toast. Grow up America. Is it possible? No. I knew it. I knew it.

[01:13:51.460 --> 01:14:03.560]
Grow up just a little teeny tiny bit. Put away those little toddler little lower. They call it little training bikes. Now what they call them training bikes, the bicycles and bikes with training wheels. Yeah, bikes with training wheels, little tiny baby crap.

[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:11.060]
Okay, get out of the sandbox. Put down your little tiny pale and shovel and start trying to be like a bunch of adults and something like a bunch of overgrown chillens.

[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:21.960]
Man, it's kind of like you always say it's chilling. Is that what we always say when we get another one of these terrifying bedtime stories about the pay-free deck parts one through a hundred. It's chilling like a villain.

[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:35.280]
And the American people are willing. That's the sad part. I made a two-thrilling. And pretty soon is going to be a lot more killing. Killin' will tie on some villain.

[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:49.560]
And the crowds are milling around. I think I'm out of material. It's 12 minutes after love. We milked that pretty good. Thank you. Ever started that. That was excellent. What a show, man. Oh, there's a spot for two teens for five dollars.

[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:56.000]
I bet you normally call them. It's an A&W spot. Two teens for five bucks.

[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:07.060]
Do I have the magic touch on that button, man? I got that. I can touch it. Well, if they're legal age and bring them on up here now.

[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:12.400]
12 minutes after love at five sixty WQM. How many times did you have an opportunity? You didn't act. You didn't hop right on it.

[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:21.340]
Well, rarely does an opportunity interrupt your life, but this one ought to interest rates have gone on even lower than they were before. It's amazing. Financial group was offering an interest rate of 3.45%.

[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:26.980]
Then they lowered it to an even more amazing 2.95% and now believe it or not, rates have gone even lower.

[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:35.740]
2.45% financing. Wait. Nine you with financial group. That's correct. 2.45%. Call financial group toll free at 1.809 for O-Lend.

[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:48.280]
How long when these low interest rates last? You're probably wondering. Well, probably not very long. So it's like a window of opportunity that we invite you to hop through with financial group and get yourself that incredibly low rate of just 2.45% and save yourself a Schmidt load of cash.

[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:57.480]
Call financial group today toll free at 1.809 for O-Lend. And you're probably wondering and I'm sure you might be what 2.45% financing will do to your monthly payments.

[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:06.200]
I'll give you some for instances. If you have a 200,000 loan, it produces your payments to only 786 a month. If you have a 100,000 loan, you pay only 3.93 a month. Unbelievable.

[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:15.740]
So do it now and save yourself a lot of cash in the process. Call financial group 1.809 for O-Lend. 1.809 for O-L-E-N-D. The Renekuil Housing Lender.

[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:19.740]
Credit restrictions apply rate somebody to change without notice 5.34 APR.

[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:24.580]
My life and look all this is 4.805 city.

[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.920]
Way to A.M.

[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:33.960]
If there's a butt ass smell it. I am Dr. Gupta. I will be performing your hot surgery today.

[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:37.640]
How are you, Dr.? What do you know? What do you say? What are you feeling, Mr. David?

[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.060]
Like I've been into a York government party. What do you think I feel like over here?

[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:45.520]
I feel like it's a simple heart-final procedure. Just breathe deeply into the basket. You won't feel it.

[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:49.460]
Say, I went on a fast. I can't move a nothing.

[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:52.200]
Look at that. He's open to my chest now.

[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:58.480]
By the way, sir. Dr. Gupta is taking off his pants. And now he's...

[01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.320]
What the...

[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.380]
...thrape in my chest, the cavity.

[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:03.960]
Stop.

[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:06.860]
Do you know who I am?

[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.500]
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:11.920]
That's not the thing I can do.

[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.820]
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.580]
He's breaking my chest.

[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:21.860]
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do...

[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:25.140]
Oh, my, did you die?

[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.580]
Oh, my, did you die?

[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.000]
It was a beautiful funeral now.

[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.320]
Even if I was the only one who showed up,

[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:35.980]
they were like a fire out of me.

[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:39.740]
Well, looks like it's time for me to do what I always wanted to do.

[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:59.200]
Oh no, the boat's coming back to life.

[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.800]
Why do you think you're going dancing on my grave?

[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.980]
I thought you were dead, Mo.

[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.440]
Of course I'm dead. I'm at Damba B.

[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:07.400]
I'm more on...

[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.020]
Ciao! You know what that means, Mo?

[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.480]
I've got a kill here now.

[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:13.500]
And how do you propose to do that since I'm already dead?

[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.420]
Well, just stop my nerve and told you, Mo.

[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.160]
Yeah, what is that?

[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.740]
I'm telling you, now, damn pious lady.

[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:21.480]
Big deal.

[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:24.180]
Now I got to stand you with my rob and stand.

[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.380]
Not yourself, I'm punk.

[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:26.680]
I'm a moored hole. See?

[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:27.180]
Why?

[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:30.520]
The power of Christ compels you.

[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:32.080]
Oh, Christ compels you.

[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.800]
The power of Christ compels you.

[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.020]
The power of Christ compels you.

[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:37.800]
Okay, 1119.

[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:39.160]
I'm telling you, look at my email.

[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:42.900]
Seven messages.

[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:43.120]
Yes.

[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.700]
Five of them from you, which are five pictures.

[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:47.820]
Oh, look at these two guys.

[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.120]
These two queen. I mean, these two go.

[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:50.680]
Well, that's okay.

[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:51.900]
I'll tell you one thing.

[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:52.920]
I've checked them all out.

[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:53.980]
This is the last one I looked at.

[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.420]
And at least for the beginning here,

[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:57.880]
we sure leaps and bounds ahead with these steps.

[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:01.340]
Now our winners on last one, leaps and bounds and light years ahead of where we were before.

[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.620]
Of course, last one, the first one we did when you were, you know, I was out.

[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:07.840]
Because I'm vacation or what was the story?

[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:09.500]
You were on vacation and, uh, yeah.

[01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:12.280]
But I mean, that was the pioneering of this.

[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:12.960]
That was just the beginning.

[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:16.640]
And it was a slow slot together at the last minute, sperm of the moment kind of thing.

[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.100]
Right.

[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.700]
So if you like to win an all expense paid, well, is it all expense?

[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:20.500]
We don't want to say that.

[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.100]
Not all expense.

[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.480]
No, just the airfare in the hotel.

[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.340]
The airfare in the hotel.

[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:26.700]
So what I think most of the expense of you punch your brains out and lose your guts at the casino,

[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:27.380]
that's your problem.

[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:31.020]
I roll the trip for two to the Bahamas three days and two nights including airfare.

[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.500]
Go to neo-roger.com, our prestigious website.

[01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:35.660]
And where you see those flaming things on there.

[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.220]
I think one of them is a picture of Muff and the other one's a picture of, uh,

[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.900]
freaky Carlos from our front.

[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:41.920]
Not our Carlos.

[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.480]
Keep in mind.

[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:42.820]
He's not.

[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.200]
FAMING!

[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.000]
Yeah, not as freaky Carlos.

[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:47.020]
No.

[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.400]
But anyway, when you see the flames, you'll know you're in the right spot and click on that baby

[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.040]
and you see how you get involved in this.

[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:53.260]
And you might be a winner.

[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.720]
Also, the other two emails from a hysterical insamuels.

[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:57.020]
Huh?

[01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:59.280]
I see with psychotics.

[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:04.380]
You says, are they, they're doing transmitter maintenance or, I mean, Internet, uh, some maintenance at 11 o'clock.

[01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:07.220]
Is the message that she got when she lost the audio?

[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:08.940]
Screeching.

[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:09.260]
It's all right.

[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:10.080]
It's 16 now.

[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.660]
I remember the Q.A.M.

[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.300]
Hi, I'd like to talk to Neil, please.

[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:14.700]
Speaking.

[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.780]
Hey, Neil, um, you're in Toronto now, right?

[01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:18.980]
Sounds like it to me.

[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:23.500]
Listen, did you, uh, did you have an orread article of the World Health Organization?

[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:27.120]
Um, I guess put a travel ban on Toronto or...

[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.400]
No, I never heard of that.

[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.120]
I was in yesterday's Miami Harrel.

[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:32.140]
Don't believe anything you read in the Harrel, man.

[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:32.880]
There's no such thing.

[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:34.540]
Are you reading any Chinese food?

[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:35.200]
No.

[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:38.420]
Hi, you know, I haven't any young, uh, some young guy.

[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:39.260]
Some young guy now.

[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.820]
Hi, uh, well, I'm not that excited.

[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.980]
I'm just a drinking bottle of water.

[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:46.140]
Come back to Florida and stay healthy.

[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:47.260]
No chance, man.

[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:47.840]
Good luck to you.

[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.880]
Well, right, yeah, well, I'm not a part of it is.

[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:51.060]
See, this is what happens.

[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.700]
People read this crap into papers.

[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:54.220]
We told you the W.H.

[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:54.400]
Oh!

[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:55.300]
You're full of crap.

[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:58.100]
If you could see what a beautiful day it is there today.

[01:20:58.340 --> 01:20:59.600]
And life is as usual.

[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:03.100]
There's nobody walking around the city with masks on, with surgical masks.

[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:05.740]
There's nobody screaming and going off the deep end.

[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:10.680]
The, uh, TTC, the subways riding just as normal, and the go train, and the come train, and all that.

[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.020]
And life goes on.

[01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:13.640]
Life goes on.

[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:16.000]
We had 20,000 people here on Monday night for that game.

[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.280]
Six of the air Canada Center.

[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.280]
Unfortunately, game seven was not so good.

[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:23.840]
But I mean, 20,000 people that didn't get sick, didn't even get SARS, didn't even cough it and people can have a headache.

[01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.300]
They got a headache from the game on Tuesday.

[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:26.880]
They saw him fully, but other than that.

[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.040]
And this is what's going on in the media.

[01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:36.040]
In fact, the prestigious New York Times, I read their story that they had yesterday about this W.H.O.

[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:36.900]
thing about Toronto.

[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:41.780]
And I'm going to tell you that if you put side by each, the article from the Toronto star,

[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:49.880]
next to the New York Times, it would be like you're talking about two different cities, two different health situations, two different worlds as Roger Williams and what's your name would say?

[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:50.440]
Jane Morgan.

[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:51.680]
Remember that on Cap Records?

[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:52.700]
No.

[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:53.660]
Boca Brian does.

[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:56.560]
If I told you once, I've told you a bunch of times.

[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:58.340]
About that song.

[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:00.840]
Which is perfect for that place.

[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.200]
I already played that moat thing tonight.

[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.280]
Yeah, but what?

[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.260]
I want to make sure I don't have a lot of distractions here.

[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.200]
We're trying to get to phone going.

[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:11.120]
I'm checking out all these damn emails, which were an old fart like me, you know?

[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:11.880]
Yeah, I know.

[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:15.700]
To be checking seven historical emails, but we do have four hundred and sixty five votes, being a boy.

[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:16.380]
I do like that.

[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:18.080]
Very impressive, myself.

[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:18.980]
It is impressive.

[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:19.460]
Edward Eric.

[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.340]
How about with me for coming up with the poll, Puts?

[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:23.800]
Well, of course, that goes without saying.

[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.520]
Which of these, yeah, right?

[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:27.640]
What's not that can be done?

[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.260]
See, everybody's on automatic, your direct deposit.

[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:31.360]
Now all of a sudden, he's not sucking around so hard anymore.

[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:32.780]
That's what definitely was complaining about.

[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:35.660]
Which of these things do you care about the least?

[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:37.980]
Harness racing, 139.

[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:40.460]
I can't believe they don't care about Kevin Wallace and George Wallace.

[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.180]
And Mickey McTickle and Brian Sears.

[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:46.220]
And Sears Robuck was that SARS-Robuck here.

[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.700]
George's sex fantasy is 97.

[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.020]
They don't want to hear about that anymore.

[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.520]
They're tired of the fact that you can't get it.

[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.060]
They don't want to hear about you.

[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:54.180]
Now, we can't get laid anymore.

[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:54.780]
They're sick of it.

[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:55.440]
They know it already.

[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:55.860]
Okay.

[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:56.620]
All right.

[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:58.740]
Hey, does Greg bring his kids into there?

[01:22:58.740 --> 01:22:59.700]
Are they off at school somewhere?

[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:00.020]
Yes.

[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:01.580]
He did bring them in?

[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:01.840]
Yes.

[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:02.600]
His daughter.

[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.400]
What about his two sons?

[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:05.840]
No.

[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.460]
They're illegal age now.

[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:09.280]
And he knows that I'm up here so they're safe.

[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:09.620]
Yeah.

[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:12.360]
And let me ask you, did we ever find out who the father was at those kids

[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.820]
since they all have a different color here?

[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:14.080]
No.

[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:15.980]
I guess now is not a good time to be asking.

[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:17.960]
Stanley Cup playoff's 35.

[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.340]
Arbitron radio waiting's 13.

[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:20.200]
Politics 11.

[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:21.640]
The NFL draft is moving up.

[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:23.820]
It got a very late start, but it's got already.

[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:25.160]
And I'm sure we'll get a lot more than that.

[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.660]
Because this is NFL draft weekend, baby.

[01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:28.500]
Yeah.

[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:29.460]
Who the hell need?

[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.680]
Why don't we get Dick Vitale to do it with a mad dog?

[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:34.420]
Who the hell needs that stodgy old fart Moe Howard Davidit,

[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:35.600]
who's playing hard to get,

[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.540]
and finally admits now that he'll be there after pretending,

[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.520]
oh, I'm unless I get paid to go with a day.

[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:41.760]
Yeah, all of this other bull crap.

[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:43.820]
Who the hell are you, man?

[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:47.420]
Just one false move, just one blink of the eye from you.

[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.440]
Just one cross-eyed look at Greg and yeah,

[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:53.080]
because there's one message I'd like to be a pasalogged Moe on behalf of management.

[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:53.880]
Greg H2.

[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:54.400]
Yeah, okay.

[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.380]
I know that for a fact.

[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:56.100]
Greg H2.

[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:57.780]
So does everybody else while I'm at it?

[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:58.820]
But especially.

[01:23:59.000 --> 01:23:59.620]
Greg H2.

[01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:02.080]
Yeah, he only wishes he could find a way to show you the exit.

[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:04.480]
Am I getting a little worked up?

[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.540]
Not enough.

[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:05.940]
Oh.

[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.160]
Don't guess what Moe.

[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:08.800]
Greg H2.

[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:09.480]
Like poison.

[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:10.780]
Like SARS.

[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:11.620]
Like arsenic.

[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:12.640]
Like he be G.B.

[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:14.660]
Like Hocus Pocus.

[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:16.420]
Because he done a focus group.

[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:20.140]
Yeah, they did a focus group with a whole bunch of people in a room.

[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:21.180]
But third, man.

[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.480]
Halle, potty, Ag GMC.

[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.780]
In business for over 35 years.

[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:27.660]
That's like old, long and some of you have been alive.

[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.340]
In one same great location.

[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:32.740]
Can you imagine the number of businesses just in their block in 30 years

[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:33.820]
that are coming and going in that time?

[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:34.720]
About third, man.

[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:35.240]
And at least.

[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:37.900]
But Halle, potty, Ag still there at 134.01.

[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:41.520]
South Fixie Highway, US one across from the falls because they make unbeatable deals.

[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.240]
And they treat you right.

[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:45.860]
For example, right now, Tom Laman and Joe Prado have got these Neil deals going on.

[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:47.480]
Halle, Neil Deal number one.

[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:52.060]
Get yourself 0% financing for 60 months on every potty Ag or GMC in stock.

[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:53.700]
Neil Deal number two.

[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.060]
Get up to a $4,000 rebate on every new GMC in potty Ag in stock.

[01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:57.620]
That is correct.

[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:00.020]
I'll say it again because it's startling, but it's true.

[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:04.360]
Get yourself up to a $4,000 rebate on every new coward truck in stock.

[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:06.400]
And Halle, right this moment as I speak.

[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:08.820]
And Neil Deal number three, if you're currently a GMSmart,

[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:10.940]
Lisa Smart by customer and driver Chevy Blazer,

[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:14.900]
and rules of Provoto or GMC Jimmy, buy or lease a new potty Ag or GMC

[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:17.300]
and get yourself an extra $1,000 off the price.

[01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:20.160]
And while you're at Halle, looking around, be sure and take a test drive

[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.940]
with the all-new, spiffy and powerful potty Ag Grand Prix too.

[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:25.640]
For more information about the Neil Deal's call their hotline tool,

[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.720]
free the Neil Deal hotline that is, say it again.

[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:28.980]
Thank you.

[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:33.720]
At 1,885344211, that's 1,885344211,

[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:36.500]
and please keep in mind that all the Neil Deal's has submitted

[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.000]
credit and provolacy in the Euler Fort details.

[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:42.120]
Halle, potty Ag GMC of all the others they are, professional greatest.

[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.580]
My life and look all this is 430560,

[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:48.780]
UAAM.

[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.180]
Howard David's a bit.

[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:54.640]
Economy tanking, biological warfare.

[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:57.500]
Two minutes of channels and tonight for our in-depth report,

[01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:00.360]
on the dangers of electric tongue cleansers.

[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:04.340]
Whiteboard Lockdown, channeled and eyewitness news.

[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:07.980]
Good hygiene is a good idea, especially after a good ass eating,

[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.180]
but using an electric tongue cleanser could.

[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:11.560]
Resultant disaster.

[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:14.180]
Channeled him a investigative reporter, Guilda Anu.

[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:15.080]
Ring, Guilda.

[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:22.220]
Join the eyewitness news team and Dan Rowell with news from the future.

[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:24.720]
Is it just a rumor that Guilty really has scabbies?

[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:27.720]
113129, till noon at 560WDQM,

[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:31.400]
the Mad Dog coming along at 1 and Hank at 3 in Marlon's baseball tonight,

[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.000]
and at EK and Joe and Mark and the Howard and what's his name, Guilty in the morning.

[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:36.640]
See, I caught him Howard at them, sort of.

[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.000]
I'm trying to be a little bit nice before the numbers come out.

[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.460]
And who knows, he could have another good month in March, right?

[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.000]
He might salvage a book and we might go in the tank.

[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.680]
Or he might have another month like December or January.

[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:48.580]
We can only hope not.

[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.960]
Because if he does good, we do bad.

[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:53.980]
If we do a good, he does bad.

[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:55.180]
See, that's the New Deal.

[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:57.580]
That's what happens when you bring in a guy who's like at war

[01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:59.100]
with the entire rest of the radio station.

[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.160]
Not a good idea, not a good lead in, not a good idea.

[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:03.720]
But that's just his thing, you know.

[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.440]
It's him against the world, kind of like George W.

[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:11.000]
Union and management negotiators at American Airlines have reached agreement on a framework

[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.280]
to keep the company out of bankruptcy.

[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:16.780]
But both sides need to win approval from their respective boards according to a congressman

[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:18.040]
who brought the two sides together.

[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.260]
Representative Martin Frost said yesterday, or today,

[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:23.740]
the agreement was reached late last night after 12 hours of meetings.

[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:27.320]
He didn't know any of the details of the deal, which was reached after he and three other congressmen

[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.560]
left the meeting earlier yesterday.

[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.080]
But he said, representatives from both sides told him the agreement.

[01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:33.800]
He said it's a done deal and I just has to be approved by the board.

[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:34.500]
Got it?

[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:35.340]
Got it.

[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:38.320]
Frost said, the future of American Airlines will probably be known today.

[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:41.620]
I think there will be a resolution one way or another two day, he said.

[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:45.540]
Two days, everybody's on pins and needles, all our friends out there who work in American

[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:46.280]
and good luck to them.

[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:46.960]
They'll need it.

[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.440]
Just like the people of fly American, good luck.

[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.220]
They're not shyness in there.

[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:50.840]
Should I say that?

[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:51.220]
No.

[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:52.960]
Did they quit with those hand grenades?

[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:56.520]
I guess because things got so tight, they couldn't afford to put any more of them hand grenades

[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.240]
in the overhead bin.

[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:00.720]
They weren't for real, it was just for effect.

[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:02.080]
Just for dramatic effect.

[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:03.280]
They go under the seat, though.

[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:08.640]
And old is Israel, Iraq, oil line reopening question mark.

[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:12.140]
The only reason I'm doing some bedtime stories is that unless we have a lag and the phone calls on it,

[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.760]
which is very distressing to me now that the phone is working again.

[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.680]
We were off to such a stirring start here today.

[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:19.740]
If you ask me, I would say so with you.

[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:20.920]
Yeah, okay, sure.

[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:22.460]
What do you mean by that?

[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:24.080]
I'm just agreeing with everything you say.

[01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:28.300]
I'm not talking to you anymore, I'm talking to Carlos.

[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:31.620]
What do you think, being a boy?

[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:32.440]
Sure.

[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:33.160]
Shut up.

[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:36.020]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6.

[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.420]
See how easy he is to get a little rid of it.

[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:41.660]
He's just a gungho, you know, any opportunity, any opening.

[01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:42.740]
So I'd watch yourself, George.

[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.280]
I'd watch you and say, don't get sick.

[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.440]
No, don't get sick.

[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:47.060]
No, we're beauty.

[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:48.360]
We're a mask.

[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:50.040]
In fact, that's probably what he's doing.

[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:53.000]
He's probably trying to infect that studio to get you a sick.

[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:55.700]
And then all of a sudden, you'll notice how fast he gets healthy again.

[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.040]
I was wondering why he was spitting on me.

[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:58.940]
Just like that week, you run vacation a couple weeks ago.

[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.240]
Man, I'm going to tell you he was dancing on your grave.

[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.780]
You thought, Geldy was dancing on most grave and I won bit.

[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:04.660]
He was dancing.

[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:05.980]
He was tap dancing on it.

[01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:09.120]
You should have put taps on his sneakers.

[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.020]
Got me to trade him, show him all the ropes.

[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:13.060]
Never see a guy put taps on sneakers.

[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:14.660]
Not lately.

[01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:15.500]
He's bottle caps.

[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:16.820]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:18.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.560]
Could you say, uh, color spit?

[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:21.900]
Go on there.

[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:24.220]
I beg your pardon?

[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:28.080]
Listen, all question over is that something you asked a week.

[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:28.760]
What's going on there?

[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:30.340]
Why is that?

[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:32.800]
Paul Kaster, I doubt that.

[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:33.820]
I doubt that very much.

[01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.880]
Paul Kaster, who has been sucking my butt, I don't think so.

[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:39.840]
Not that the goofball.

[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.680]
There's nothing to say about him.

[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:42.380]
That's very sad.

[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.220]
Got it ripped off everybody else's material.

[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:46.160]
He's on a big, powerful station on air.

[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:47.100]
I'll tell you one thing.

[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:50.980]
Look back at those numbers, back in the good old days when Zeta was really a power house.

[01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:52.620]
Not power 96, but a power house.

[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:54.880]
I understand.

[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.540]
You know, you got that aging sidekick on her with you, Paul.

[01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:58.060]
I understand.

[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.880]
I think they could have a precipitous drop in his book tomorrow.

[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:03.600]
Don't you, Zeta?

[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:05.840]
I don't know where they're at.

[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:06.280]
I forgot.

[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:07.320]
I just made that up.

[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:09.780]
I don't know either, but I just made that up just to make them more nervous.

[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:11.500]
See, they make a difference to me.

[01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:13.000]
I got a good contract, Paulie, man.

[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.160]
I said, Paulie, man.

[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.460]
Maybe that's the Paulie man they were talking about.

[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:16.980]
Kaster Noah.

[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:20.100]
Maybe that was a sublime little thing on his part to try to get into QNB.

[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:20.900]
Even though he didn't know.

[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:21.440]
Even though he didn't know.

[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:22.360]
He didn't know.

[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:23.560]
You're a liar, Paulie.

[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:24.300]
You're a liar.

[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:27.940]
Everybody in the building knows you've been trying for the last three, four years to get into QNB.

[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:28.640]
And it'll work out in the morning.

[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:29.680]
So, and the answer is still.

[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:29.900]
No.

[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:30.760]
I talked to him up.

[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:31.600]
I talked to Clarence.

[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.280]
I talked to Greg.

[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:33.580]
I talked to the water now.

[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:33.940]
It's even.

[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:38.220]
And they said no chance that Kaster Noah is still old material.

[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.420]
No chance.

[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:42.300]
Everybody QAM?

[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:43.560]
How are you doing, Neil?

[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:44.940]
Maybe that's why he's sucking around.

[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:46.040]
He's looking to get in the station again.

[01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:46.400]
Yes sir.

[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:46.860]
How are you?

[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:47.700]
My name's Lance.

[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:48.460]
I have a cold.

[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:49.820]
You'll have to excuse me.

[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:52.820]
You talked last week about a show on TV called up.

[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:53.360]
Reverend Jones.

[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:54.200]
I'm too hot.

[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:55.380]
Reverend Jones.

[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:56.860]
Your week, Reverend Jones.

[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:57.540]
You're very weak.

[01:30:57.540 --> 01:30:57.880]
Okay.

[01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.680]
That's two tries in last half hour.

[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.040]
By the way, speaking of are you hot?

[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:02.940]
This water was unbelievably sexy.

[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:07.200]
And beautiful, intelligent are you hot?

[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.220]
Being hot and sexy is fun for a while.

[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:10.680]
But it sure does get boring.

[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:11.740]
Check out this hot cold.

[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.040]
I don't give a damn hot sexy.

[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:13.280]
Look.

[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:14.680]
Flown down and you're in pain.

[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:15.720]
She's just hot.

[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:17.080]
Everywhere you look at her, she's sexy.

[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:18.220]
She's just smoking.

[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:18.900]
Let's start.

[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.320]
I've been leaving now.

[01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:20.940]
Come on.

[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:21.940]
Come on.

[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:23.540]
Way from.

[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:26.000]
You sexy pain.

[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:26.620]
You sexy pain.

[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:27.040]
Sucks the pain.

[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:27.480]
You.

[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.360]
I've been leaving now.

[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:30.000]
Come on.

[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:30.940]
Come on.

[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:34.960]
You sexy pain.

[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.940]
I think we should sex each other.

[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:39.160]
No matter what we do, we always think we have a good time.

[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.380]
And she's pretty sexy too.

[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:42.400]
I'm too sexy.

[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.020]
Wow, that's a sexy pose.

[01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:46.140]
I'm sorry, I'm so damn sexy.

[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.560]
And I'm wet and hot.

[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.000]
Some kinds of them are a little bloated.

[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:50.000]
I don't feel that sexy.

[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.000]
I am a sexy bit.

[01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:53.380]
She is so hot.

[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:54.780]
Because that's sexy.

[01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:56.500]
I've been leaving now.

[01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:57.720]
Come on.

[01:31:58.140 --> 01:31:59.400]
You sexy pain.

[01:31:59.580 --> 01:31:59.740]
You sexy pain.

[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:00.920]
I think we should sex each other.

[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:00.920]

[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.320]
You sexy pain.

[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:03.740]
I'm wet.

[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:04.200]

[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:05.940]
So that's what's beneath it.

[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:07.080]
That's what it's under.

[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:07.840]
Partly.

[01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:08.140]

[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.520]
What a shame.

[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.080]
I think I only saw that one week.

[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:13.140]
It was pretty damn good.

[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:14.100]
It was pretty hot, man.

[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:15.320]
My TV was smoldering.

[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:16.480]
I thought the glass was going to melt.

[01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:19.000]
See if it hadn't been for Lorenzo ripping off Howard.

[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:20.160]
There you go.

[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:21.260]
Pick it on Lorenzo Lamiskin.

[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:22.040]
Because you just jealous.

[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:23.600]
You only wish you looked like he used to.

[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:23.900]
Yeah.

[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:24.600]
So long.

[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:26.240]
Or their business.

[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:27.820]
Here's Mayor Mel, man.

[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.920]
He is pissed off and fired up at the WHP.

[01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:31.730]
He is screaming.

[01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:34.290]
Hop it up and on like grubble stillskin.

[01:32:35.610 --> 01:32:36.530]
5, 6, 7.

[01:32:36.690 --> 01:32:38.130]
You know, I don't know about this line too.

[01:32:38.730 --> 01:32:39.490]
I guess it's working.

[01:32:39.570 --> 01:32:42.110]
But there's something spastic about this whole phone thing.

[01:32:42.230 --> 01:32:42.370]
You know.

[01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:45.910]
There's something really spastic going on there.

[01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:49.570]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 18,

[01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:50.210]
TNT and Verizon.

[01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:51.310]
We're doing screenless.

[01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:52.630]
I think we got the audience trained to that.

[01:32:52.810 --> 01:32:54.590]
And we'll be doing it for the foreseeable future.

[01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:55.930]
Next 20, 30 years.

[01:32:55.930 --> 01:32:56.350]
When you think?

[01:32:56.770 --> 01:32:57.430]
Oh, please.

[01:32:58.110 --> 01:33:00.050]
Well, maybe not 20 years, maybe.

[01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.950]
Not 30, man.

[01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.410]
I don't know.

[01:33:01.690 --> 01:33:02.770]
We'll see how it goes.

[01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.830]
WQIM.

[01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.890]
Neil.

[01:33:06.330 --> 01:33:06.670]
Yes, sir.

[01:33:07.130 --> 01:33:07.710]
Good morning.

[01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:11.770]
And congratulations for Tio making the front page

[01:33:11.770 --> 01:33:13.250]
of the Palm Beach Post today.

[01:33:13.450 --> 01:33:13.750]
I see.

[01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:15.650]
I come up here and put this place on the map to

[01:33:15.650 --> 01:33:16.970]
Leafs think to join out on Tuesday.

[01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:19.590]
And then we got the big sourcing with the WHP.

[01:33:19.670 --> 01:33:19.670]

[01:33:20.250 --> 01:33:20.990]
You know what?

[01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:23.050]
I would carry an umbrella when I leave the house.

[01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:25.670]
Because it's just a question of time until Rick Sanchez

[01:33:25.670 --> 01:33:27.530]
begins squatting over a map of terror.

[01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:28.870]
He's not permitted in here.

[01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:30.330]
We've already got his picture at the border.

[01:33:30.450 --> 01:33:30.770]
No chance.

[01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:31.770]
No sepia mishaki.

[01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.610]
Okay.

[01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:39.010]
Listen, I do have an idea as to why our beloved ex-friends,

[01:33:39.230 --> 01:33:42.690]
Mr. Henry, has turned such a right-wing Nazi.

[01:33:43.190 --> 01:33:43.670]
Are you sure?

[01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:46.610]
He's getting a TV show.

[01:33:46.930 --> 01:33:47.130]
Right.

[01:33:47.530 --> 01:33:53.390]
And as we all know, who owns the media, all of the media.

[01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:57.810]
And if he were to come out and think he's just kissing that guy.

[01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:59.910]
That's why he's covering his ass by saying,

[01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:03.170]
oh, I'm really taking a chance because I could lose my show

[01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:04.910]
with my TV show by coming out in favor of the world.

[01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:05.650]
That's what he would say.

[01:34:05.730 --> 01:34:08.670]
That's like saying that I'm really taking a wrist by coming out in favor of mom

[01:34:08.670 --> 01:34:09.390]
and apple pie.

[01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:12.070]
That's what didn't make any sense.

[01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:12.950]
Okay, calm down.

[01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:14.210]
You get a little bit too excited now.

[01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:18.030]
Listen, Tio, there's a new Johnny Depp movie coming out.

[01:34:19.150 --> 01:34:19.550]
Okay.

[01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:21.450]
Pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:22.810]
It looks like a good movie.

[01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:24.570]
Are you going to be dressed up as a pirate though

[01:34:24.570 --> 01:34:26.770]
or a swish bus swashbuckler with all of this stuff?

[01:34:26.770 --> 01:34:27.190]
He's a swishbuckler.

[01:34:27.630 --> 01:34:29.590]
Have you seen Blow?

[01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:30.770]
No.

[01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:32.170]
That's a good movie.

[01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:33.990]
That's a true story with Johnny Depp.

[01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:35.190]
He's excellent in that.

[01:34:35.290 --> 01:34:36.570]
That's very good movie.

[01:34:36.930 --> 01:34:37.450]
You enjoy it.

[01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:38.630]
Oh, Johnny Depp is in Blow?

[01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:40.190]
Yeah.

[01:34:40.890 --> 01:34:41.790]
Because I didn't know.

[01:34:42.210 --> 01:34:43.090]
It was on the other day.

[01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:44.790]
I think it's how one of my movie channels this week.

[01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:45.490]
I might catch it.

[01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:46.230]
I'll tell you what.

[01:34:46.330 --> 01:34:46.610]
That guy.

[01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:46.610]

[01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:48.970]
And at the end of it, listen, at the end,

[01:34:49.150 --> 01:34:51.450]
there's about a 10 minute interview with Johnny Depp

[01:34:51.450 --> 01:34:53.210]
and the actual guy that's still in prison.

[01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:55.630]
So after the credits, keep watching it

[01:34:55.630 --> 01:34:58.050]
because the interview's pretty interesting as well.

[01:34:58.050 --> 01:34:58.530]
How about you?

[01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:58.950]
How about you?

[01:34:58.950 --> 01:34:59.450]
It's on DVD.

[01:35:00.710 --> 01:35:01.510]
Oh, no doubt.

[01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.970]
Which is a good thing.

[01:35:03.370 --> 01:35:05.310]
You get all those extras when you get the DVD.

[01:35:05.970 --> 01:35:07.890]
And believe it or not, the show is moving.

[01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.270]

[01:35:08.670 --> 01:35:12.010]
The TV Herman is in there and he's pretty good in it also.

[01:35:12.170 --> 01:35:12.890]
Is he blowing too?

[01:35:13.930 --> 01:35:15.910]
Actually, he does play a fair against this one.

[01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:16.830]
What a surprise.

[01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:17.890]
Okay, have a great day, Palli.

[01:35:17.970 --> 01:35:18.490]
Love you, Neil.

[01:35:18.690 --> 01:35:19.570]
Say hi to Johnny Depp.

[01:35:19.670 --> 01:35:20.410]
He's my kind of guy.

[01:35:20.530 --> 01:35:24.350]
Man, what memories of Johnny and his brown leather jackets stand next to me?

[01:35:24.530 --> 01:35:26.230]
I wish I had those pictures from those days.

[01:35:26.430 --> 01:35:28.030]
I mentioned the bird took him with him to his box.

[01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:30.810]
To his birdcades, don't you think?

[01:35:32.050 --> 01:35:32.210]
Yeah.

[01:35:32.370 --> 01:35:33.250]
To his birdcades.

[01:35:33.250 --> 01:35:33.990]
Birdbox in the sky.

[01:35:34.210 --> 01:35:35.490]
Oh, man, that Johnny Depp.

[01:35:35.570 --> 01:35:37.350]
He had skin like silk.

[01:35:37.690 --> 01:35:38.210]
Anyway, I'm sorry.

[01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:40.870]
So there's another reason you should watch Ed Wood when it's on.

[01:35:41.130 --> 01:35:42.610]
I think you need to go out of your way or anything.

[01:35:43.290 --> 01:35:43.490]
Wood?

[01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:44.750]
Ed.

[01:35:45.970 --> 01:35:46.690]
I'm probably.

[01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:49.030]
When I do Johnny Depp, I probably have.

[01:35:49.090 --> 01:35:52.350]
I'm telling you, he was just one of the most remarkable people I have ever seen.

[01:35:52.670 --> 01:35:54.970]
He made Tom Welling look like a beener boy.

[01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:57.310]
Oh, yeah.

[01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:59.630]
That's how good he looked when he was sitting right there.

[01:35:59.770 --> 01:36:00.930]
He was picking on Carlos.

[01:36:01.410 --> 01:36:02.370]
I'm not picking on you.

[01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:03.650]
You're the one who calls him ugly Chuck.

[01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:07.670]
Yeah, well, I try to call him something like more respectable like beener boy.

[01:36:07.810 --> 01:36:08.590]
That's more respectful.

[01:36:08.610 --> 01:36:09.830]
I mean, ugly Chuck.

[01:36:10.050 --> 01:36:10.490]
What is that?

[01:36:10.690 --> 01:36:11.210]
Like up Chuck.

[01:36:12.030 --> 01:36:12.330]
That's right.

[01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:13.890]
That's like what you call fat people skinny.

[01:36:16.890 --> 01:36:17.730]
Blown people red.

[01:36:18.490 --> 01:36:19.470]
Is he talking again?

[01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:22.630]
Sense of bringing in the slap in the head.

[01:36:23.850 --> 01:36:26.090]
19 till noon at 5.60 W to Q.A.

[01:36:26.170 --> 01:36:29.890]
And hey, let me tell you right now, if your mattress is lumpy and bumpy, you're just not sleeping good.

[01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:33.050]
You wake up in the morning, you feel like you've been tossing and turning, and you probably have.

[01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.990]
Here's the deal.

[01:36:34.130 --> 01:36:36.070]
Over a million people, a million smart people.

[01:36:36.170 --> 01:36:38.070]
I know it's amazing that there's that many around, but there are.

[01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:43.750]
Who have bought a mattress right over the phone from dial amateurs, including yours truly and George and Miguel and lots of other smart folks.

[01:36:44.130 --> 01:36:50.730]
Call 1-800-MATTRES right now, and you'll be guaranteeing yourself and your back a great night's sleep tonight and for a long time to come.

[01:36:51.170 --> 01:36:53.490]
They carry only the best mattresses made by man.

[01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:55.350]
Seely, Sir, the Simmons, King Coyle.

[01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:58.430]
They got every size and style imaginable ready for immediate delivery.

[01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:00.930]
You'll never get a bait and swish when you call dial amateurs.

[01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:03.010]
They're ranked number one in customer satisfaction.

[01:37:03.810 --> 01:37:07.070]
They've got more repeat and referral customers than anybody in the world because they know how to treat you right.

[01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:10.070]
And I promise you I'll bet both George and Carlos's life on.

[01:37:10.230 --> 01:37:12.230]
I'll throw in Greg there too, but all three of their lives.

[01:37:12.370 --> 01:37:17.690]
And once you buy a mattress from dial amateurs, you never dream of going back to a showroom and schlepping around town by it that way again.

[01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:23.670]
And don't forget, when you buy your mattress over the phone by making that one EC phone call, they set up the new and take away your crappy old vetting for free.

[01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:24.130]
That's correct.

[01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:28.750]
Dial amateurs sets up the new and takes away your smelly nasty soil old vetting for free.

[01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:33.030]
So make the call right now to dial amateurs 1-800-MATTRES.

[01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:37.130]
1-800-MATTRES and you and your back will be happy campus for years to come.

[01:37:37.410 --> 01:37:42.030]
Dial amateurs the intelligently brilliant way to buy you a great new mattress and get a great night's sleep.

[01:37:42.370 --> 01:37:45.430]
I am the local CCC's 5-City.

[01:37:45.970 --> 01:37:47.210]
The radio's on your side.

[01:37:47.470 --> 01:37:49.190]
It's a vacuum in.

[01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:53.650]
This is the most disgusting program.

[01:37:54.330 --> 01:37:57.210]
I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[01:37:57.370 --> 01:38:01.230]
You've tried those other breakfast cereals that claim to be all natural.

[01:38:01.230 --> 01:38:03.710]
Now, get the real thing.

[01:38:04.730 --> 01:38:06.950]
Introducing Cowlogs Sugar Plops.

[01:38:07.450 --> 01:38:12.390]
To bring you all natural fiber rich goodness, cow logs when straight to the farm.

[01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:14.470]
Lightly toasted what we found.

[01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:15.950]
Then sweetened it.

[01:38:16.230 --> 01:38:19.930]
So next time you're shopping, don't just reach for any breakfast cereal.

[01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:23.370]
Reach for the all natural cow log sugar plops.

[01:38:23.630 --> 01:38:26.130]
It's like nothing you've ever tasted for breakfast.

[01:38:26.130 --> 01:38:26.930]
Ah!

[01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:30.810]
Garant to you.

[01:38:30.970 --> 01:38:34.590]
11-47 at 5-60 W-Q-A-M Happy Thursday to you.

[01:38:34.810 --> 01:38:39.990]
And here's the article of the guy we've referred to at the beginning of the show by Jeff Miller in the sports section of the hero today.

[01:38:40.810 --> 01:38:43.170]
Brian Murray sent packing back to Shukshesh.

[01:38:44.050 --> 01:38:45.450]
How do you spell Shukshesh?

[01:38:46.630 --> 01:38:48.350]
But anyway, here's that one paragraph.

[01:38:48.650 --> 01:38:53.970]
Murray, Brian, me and Brian, ruled straight downhill from that peak, meaning the big, big, panther year that one year.

[01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:55.650]
That seems like a lifetime ago.

[01:38:55.930 --> 01:38:59.030]
Picture a cartoon snowball until he and his brother Terry were dumped.

[01:38:59.290 --> 01:39:00.450]
They're parting news conference.

[01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:02.730]
Curry Live on the panther's Fangship radio station.

[01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:05.250]
Complete with the comedic sounds of intermittent flatulence.

[01:39:06.850 --> 01:39:07.830]
Nice going, Jeff.

[01:39:08.530 --> 01:39:10.450]
Somebody of one of our newspapers has got the balls.

[01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:11.630]
Even though we don't mention my name.

[01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:13.950]
To make at least a veiled reference to the show.

[01:39:14.050 --> 01:39:16.190]
Any incredible comedy that's becoming from it.

[01:39:16.190 --> 01:39:17.230]
Okay, and the Roma as well.

[01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:19.270]
I came from both Murray's, but they left in their wake.

[01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:21.510]
Okay, don't be tell me about Anna Heim and the duck.

[01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:24.010]
That's that's a whole different ball game.

[01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:28.670]
I see team of Salani and coming back with San Jose with his sharks.

[01:39:29.490 --> 01:39:33.010]
Which means the least better get team of Salani or somebody who's going to probably get his ass fired.

[01:39:33.450 --> 01:39:33.790]
Right, Pat?

[01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:35.250]
Right.

[01:39:35.630 --> 01:39:38.390]
Want to do some hockey talk now that Rimmer is going to be here this afternoon.

[01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:41.250]
Maybe tomorrow morning we can have a room around just before we do the ratings.

[01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:41.750]
What do you say?

[01:39:41.850 --> 01:39:42.650]
No hockey show.

[01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:43.150]
No.

[01:39:44.890 --> 01:39:47.550]
If you could only see, you know, there's this guest mic in here.

[01:39:48.250 --> 01:39:48.610]
Yeah.

[01:39:48.610 --> 01:39:50.630]
That's way up in the air for like a nine foot tall.

[01:39:50.710 --> 01:39:52.330]
If we had like an NBA guy and he will be great.

[01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:54.430]
But I mean, it's not a boom.

[01:39:54.650 --> 01:39:55.450]
So you can move it around.

[01:39:55.570 --> 01:39:56.230]
But there's no place.

[01:39:56.570 --> 01:39:59.350]
You need, first of all, you'd have to like crawl around behind this thing.

[01:39:59.650 --> 01:40:01.550]
And there's no place to put a chair back there.

[01:40:01.610 --> 01:40:02.850]
You have to do like stand-up comedy.

[01:40:03.090 --> 01:40:04.430]
Like, oh, you know, the stand-up guy.

[01:40:04.630 --> 01:40:05.530]
He'd still do it, Rimmer.

[01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:06.950]
No chance.

[01:40:07.410 --> 01:40:08.070]
Keep him out of here.

[01:40:08.150 --> 01:40:09.250]
Okay, keep him out of here.

[01:40:10.630 --> 01:40:13.250]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[01:40:14.110 --> 01:40:15.750]
The ATAT and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:40:16.050 --> 01:40:17.050]
Here's a medical guy.

[01:40:17.050 --> 01:40:19.230]
They were in a high risk situation.

[01:40:19.230 --> 01:40:21.650]
They would come up as they were planned to do.

[01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:26.450]
Investigations led to confirmations that the patients were not SARS infected.

[01:40:26.710 --> 01:40:27.510]
So how do you like that?

[01:40:28.650 --> 01:40:29.310]
How do you like that?

[01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:30.350]
Everybody sniffles now.

[01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:30.890]
Oh, my God.

[01:40:30.970 --> 01:40:33.010]
You got to start everybody in the median.

[01:40:33.010 --> 01:40:35.030]
I'm the general public is trying to get the public scared.

[01:40:35.630 --> 01:40:39.110]
You know, you got a fever by 145.

[01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:40.610]
You probably do have some kind of a problem.

[01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:45.790]
Although Carlos was telling me when he was bitterly complaining the other day about that big lump on his neck,

[01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:47.730]
that Duff was trying to take his temperature.

[01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:47.930]
Right.

[01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:50.070]
WBQAM.

[01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:53.550]
He said he told him it was a thermometer.

[01:40:53.850 --> 01:40:54.430]
What is it?

[01:40:54.710 --> 01:40:55.150]
I'm finished.

[01:40:55.630 --> 01:40:56.450]
Yeah, you're finished.

[01:40:56.650 --> 01:40:56.870]
All right.

[01:40:57.310 --> 01:40:59.090]
Speaking of Team Uselani, he said he's finished.

[01:41:00.110 --> 01:41:05.370]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the ATAT and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:41:05.630 --> 01:41:06.110]
Look at that phone.

[01:41:06.210 --> 01:41:07.290]
Is that disappointing or what?

[01:41:08.030 --> 01:41:08.390]
Whatever.

[01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:09.590]
On a screen of Thursday.

[01:41:09.610 --> 01:41:10.510]
Not even noon yet.

[01:41:10.590 --> 01:41:11.730]
These people can't keep it up.

[01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:15.770]
They just can't keep up the great the brilliance that's necessary for this.

[01:41:16.650 --> 01:41:18.390]
We need this audience, baby.

[01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:19.390]
We need this crowd.

[01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:24.070]
We need to have the same kind of loyalty on this show that the right wingers, the ditto heads,

[01:41:24.190 --> 01:41:25.130]
give the large ass in there.

[01:41:25.370 --> 01:41:26.970]
You know, we need to have all of that fake crap.

[01:41:27.090 --> 01:41:29.230]
You know, fake real, a made up, whatever you want to do.

[01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:32.330]
Not just this book, but for months and years to come.

[01:41:32.590 --> 01:41:33.270]
That's what we need.

[01:41:33.630 --> 01:41:34.230]
Because that's the only way.

[01:41:34.410 --> 01:41:36.290]
See, that's why this book tomorrow so important.

[01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:40.090]
Not only is it like the could be the death knell for a certain show in the morning on some station.

[01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:41.270]
Not to mention no names.

[01:41:41.570 --> 01:41:44.810]
But also to see if we can actually continue to hold ours up in the air.

[01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:48.990]
At a time when everybody's being intimidated, you have to go step and you have to be right wing.

[01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:51.910]
And you either with us or against us, you have to be super patriotic.

[01:41:52.190 --> 01:41:56.730]
And you have to support the bush, my student, no matter how many evil and grotesque unacceptable things he doesn't say, etc.

[01:41:58.130 --> 01:42:01.650]
So let's see if cheap channels on the right track or maybe we can kick their ass tomorrow.

[01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:02.290]
Let's see.

[01:42:02.410 --> 01:42:02.890]
You don't know.

[01:42:03.230 --> 01:42:06.650]
We had one bad month and one real good month out of the three.

[01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:07.650]
That's what we know so far.

[01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:09.530]
January, September was sensational.

[01:42:10.130 --> 01:42:11.190]
And I will just wait and see.

[01:42:11.630 --> 01:42:12.230]
We'll twiddle our thumb.

[01:42:12.230 --> 01:42:12.910]
I'll twiddle my thumbs.

[01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:13.650]
You twiddle your thumbs.

[01:42:13.650 --> 01:42:14.930]
I'll actually doing it right now.

[01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:15.490]
All right.

[01:42:15.630 --> 01:42:15.990]
Here we go.

[01:42:16.110 --> 01:42:18.230]
And we'll wait and see what's going to happen tomorrow.

[01:42:18.490 --> 01:42:19.170]
Lot of pressure.

[01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:20.490]
Lot of tension.

[01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.670]
WQAM.

[01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:27.170]
See what I mean?

[01:42:28.590 --> 01:42:29.910]
Maybe they're twiddling their thumbs.

[01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.450]
Yes, sir.

[01:42:30.930 --> 01:42:32.210]
Who the hell is Chimu Salani?

[01:42:32.890 --> 01:42:33.270]
Who is he?

[01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:34.370]
Number eight.

[01:42:34.690 --> 01:42:35.610]
Number eight.

[01:42:35.730 --> 01:42:36.430]
Number eight.

[01:42:36.510 --> 01:42:36.910]
He's great.

[01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:38.930]
5670560.

[01:42:39.150 --> 01:42:40.230]
See there's another macho guy.

[01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:40.610]
He's called me.

[01:42:40.630 --> 01:42:40.950]
Fat boy.

[01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:43.210]
We would know hockey player if they'd if they'd high stick him in the push.

[01:42:44.110 --> 01:42:45.450]
And I guarantee he's got one.

[01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.870]
WQAM.

[01:42:47.630 --> 01:42:47.850]
Hello.

[01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:48.710]
Yes, sir.

[01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:49.310]
Is this Neil?

[01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:50.510]
Yes, sounds like me.

[01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:51.890]
What's happening, Neil?

[01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.590]
How you doing?

[01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:56.210]
I was just going to say I'm a first-time car.

[01:42:56.770 --> 01:42:56.990]
OK.

[01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:59.770]
And don't you like the way we do this screenless?

[01:42:59.870 --> 01:43:02.370]
You don't have to be interrogated by a bunch of people before you get on the air.

[01:43:02.410 --> 01:43:02.730]
It's great.

[01:43:02.970 --> 01:43:03.570]
Yeah, no kidding.

[01:43:03.650 --> 01:43:05.110]
I was just telling my buddy about that.

[01:43:05.290 --> 01:43:05.590]
How you got to do this.

[01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:09.030]
Some of the other shows, man, they put like a whole screening committee.

[01:43:09.130 --> 01:43:10.410]
And you have to talk like six people.

[01:43:10.590 --> 01:43:12.610]
And you have to give them their shoe size and social security.

[01:43:12.610 --> 01:43:13.570]
And they still have that.

[01:43:13.730 --> 01:43:14.010]
Exactly.

[01:43:15.010 --> 01:43:17.030]
And also Florida socks.

[01:43:17.530 --> 01:43:18.450]
Just to let you know.

[01:43:19.210 --> 01:43:19.510]
OK.

[01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:23.250]
I mean, I've been here for years and you know, this place definitely blows.

[01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:27.990]
But also, I wanted you to, if you can, play that one bit.

[01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:29.750]
Why don't you play butterfly kisses?

[01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:30.770]
Do you never mind me, George?

[01:43:30.930 --> 01:43:31.350]
I'll be right back.

[01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:32.250]
Don't forget to play Butter.

[01:43:32.450 --> 01:43:33.150]
I'll write it down.

[01:43:33.230 --> 01:43:33.350]
Yes.

[01:43:34.090 --> 01:43:39.210]
That one bit that you guys have on that woman who takes her car to the mechanic.

[01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:42.010]
And she gets her back and is a turd in the back seat.

[01:43:42.010 --> 01:43:44.470]
Oh, I wonder if I brought that damn disc with me or not.

[01:43:44.630 --> 01:43:44.890]
OK.

[01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:45.950]
If I can find it, you've got it.

[01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:46.270]
Yes.

[01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:47.270]
You've got that, dude.

[01:43:47.530 --> 01:43:49.430]
My cousin's here and I told him about it.

[01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:50.550]
But I don't remember the whole thing.

[01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:53.230]
But he probably died laughing if you got that.

[01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:54.410]
I'll get around for it.

[01:43:54.510 --> 01:43:54.750]
OK.

[01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:55.170]
That's cool.

[01:43:55.170 --> 01:43:56.210]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:43:56.250 --> 01:43:56.450]
All right.

[01:43:56.490 --> 01:43:56.850]
Thanks, pal.

[01:43:57.150 --> 01:43:57.750]
See you, pal.

[01:43:58.570 --> 01:44:00.290]
I don't know if I brought that with me or not.

[01:44:00.510 --> 01:44:01.910]
What number more or less was it?

[01:44:02.130 --> 01:44:02.770]
To a both look?

[01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:03.850]
No, no.

[01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.350]
You understand.

[01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:05.070]
It wasn't on there.

[01:44:05.130 --> 01:44:06.710]
It was on at Bob Wolf's disc.

[01:44:06.810 --> 01:44:07.390]
That special disc.

[01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:07.890]
I'll be right back.

[01:44:08.430 --> 01:44:10.430]
So you're dealing with stuff now.

[01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:12.530]
You're a little bit over your out of your league, man.

[01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:16.230]
You're dabbling with stuff that you haven't encountered yet.

[01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:18.130]
It's like you're starting to give me a lecture on SARS.

[01:44:18.370 --> 01:44:20.930]
This is something that's a little bit out of your element so far.

[01:44:21.370 --> 01:44:25.310]
Stick with the stuff you know about the damn Jews and about the poor Palestinians.

[01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:27.530]
Stick with the stuff about that smelly ass.

[01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:28.630]
And then you'll be OK.

[01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:31.050]
But once you start venturing out of this other realm,

[01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:34.610]
then you start treading on very, very shaky ground.

[01:44:35.850 --> 01:44:37.750]
Why still do my shakies, you know?

[01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:39.670]
And let me just give a little piece of advice.

[01:44:39.850 --> 01:44:41.630]
All you people out there who think it's cute being fat.

[01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:44.090]
When you do get diabetes and most of you will,

[01:44:44.170 --> 01:44:46.210]
if you're fat in some of your kids will too, which is a disgrace.

[01:44:47.210 --> 01:44:49.950]
You'll discover it's no goddamn fun being diabetic.

[01:44:50.490 --> 01:44:52.030]
And one of the things I'm miss being able to eat,

[01:44:52.150 --> 01:44:54.790]
not only just a pasta, which is my favorite, but pizza.

[01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:58.050]
This business is having a scrape off the toppings.

[01:44:58.370 --> 01:44:59.850]
That takes away all the fun, you know?

[01:45:01.810 --> 01:45:04.230]
That would be like a, that would be like a, a, a banana split.

[01:45:04.990 --> 01:45:06.870]
And all you can eat is the sauce off the top.

[01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:08.310]
You can't eat, you know what I mean?

[01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:09.830]
And you can't even eat that.

[01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:12.650]
But I'm just saying if that's what you could do, who now wants that?

[01:45:15.090 --> 01:45:16.250]
So don't become diabetic.

[01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:16.910]
Lose the guy.

[01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:18.090]
Then wait, stop picking out.

[01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:19.570]
Stop shoveling that stuff and you're pushing,

[01:45:19.570 --> 01:45:22.290]
walking around carrying that enormous gigantic pooping.

[01:45:24.090 --> 01:45:27.770]
Brother, just unbelievably sad and just tragic.

[01:45:28.090 --> 01:45:30.810]
This is one of the great nightmares of USA.

[01:45:31.170 --> 01:45:33.290]
And nobody, I mean, you have a few people want to talk about it.

[01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:35.450]
We get the obligatory story every month.

[01:45:35.450 --> 01:45:36.970]
There's a new story and a new statistic.

[01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:38.750]
And people just keep shoveling.

[01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:40.290]
And you see the thing with the sugar people?

[01:45:40.670 --> 01:45:41.190]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:41.710 --> 01:45:43.510]
I never got around to talking about that story.

[01:45:43.570 --> 01:45:44.850]
The sugar people are the evil people.

[01:45:45.710 --> 01:45:47.530]
And the sugar people are getting ready to sue.

[01:45:47.650 --> 01:45:48.670]
Where do I want to do with that story?

[01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:49.410]
I've got to hear somewhere.

[01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:51.430]
Oh, I got something.

[01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:52.910]
No, you don't have to play any music.

[01:45:52.990 --> 01:45:53.350]
Okay.

[01:45:53.610 --> 01:45:54.770]
Oh, there's the horse meat debate.

[01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:57.490]
Maybe a bit of a way to give people out of duchess.

[01:45:57.490 --> 01:45:58.230]
Keep reading that every day.

[01:45:58.330 --> 01:46:01.190]
There's the thing about cheap channel and what a bunch of lunatics they are.

[01:46:01.450 --> 01:46:03.070]
Here's that litter from Jim Lenson plantation.

[01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:03.810]
I saved that.

[01:46:04.730 --> 01:46:06.030]
There's Elvis was a diabetic.

[01:46:06.030 --> 01:46:06.550]
You see?

[01:46:06.650 --> 01:46:07.310]
Look what happened to him.

[01:46:07.390 --> 01:46:08.010]
Elvis, he's dead.

[01:46:08.770 --> 01:46:09.750]
I rest my case.

[01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:10.690]
He's dead.

[01:46:12.170 --> 01:46:13.990]
Paint your Easter eggs with air of blood.

[01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.590]
There's another thing.

[01:46:17.010 --> 01:46:18.310]
From WhiteHouse.org.

[01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:20.890]
There's that thing about Miss Grudge.

[01:46:21.230 --> 01:46:22.830]
Miss Grudge and David Brock.

[01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:23.690]
And there's lovely flowers.

[01:46:23.690 --> 01:46:25.150]
Those pansies that Matt sent.

[01:46:25.610 --> 01:46:25.950]
Look what I found.

[01:46:26.590 --> 01:46:27.350]
Hey, you're on this.

[01:46:27.490 --> 01:46:28.550]
This Tito ain't on the out here.

[01:46:30.630 --> 01:46:31.530]
Are you found it?

[01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.950]
Yeah.

[01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:33.090]
It was right there.

[01:46:33.090 --> 01:46:34.050]
See? I knew I left it there.

[01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:36.210]
Well, let's, uh, we'll, uh, I don't know.

[01:46:36.370 --> 01:46:37.150]
We'll put it in the next hour.

[01:46:37.770 --> 01:46:39.170]
We'll try to start the next hour.

[01:46:39.450 --> 01:46:40.430]
And then we'll do butterfly kisses.

[01:46:40.690 --> 01:46:42.070]
And because I'm getting way behind here.

[01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.590]
I eat.

[01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:45.150]
And I can't find that story about those damn sugar bastards.

[01:46:45.370 --> 01:46:46.990]
But those other people are getting really pissed off.

[01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:49.370]
Because more and more, we're discovering that that hidden sugar

[01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:51.470]
in everything is what's killing people heart disease.

[01:46:51.790 --> 01:46:53.650]
And we are clogged arteries and all these other things.

[01:46:53.970 --> 01:46:56.790]
Their point is that 25% of your diet can consist of sugar.

[01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:57.910]
And you'll be just fine.

[01:46:58.030 --> 01:46:58.430]
Right.

[01:46:59.010 --> 01:47:02.310]
Yeah, just take a syringe full of sugar and just stick it in your veins, baby.

[01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:03.990]
Just take a sugar hit every day.

[01:47:04.230 --> 01:47:04.550]
Yeah.

[01:47:06.150 --> 01:47:07.270]
I said sugar hit.

[01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.710]
Okay.

[01:47:08.970 --> 01:47:10.170]
I think I said that tonight.

[01:47:10.890 --> 01:47:11.710]
Just a seconder.

[01:47:11.730 --> 01:47:12.750]
I thought I said the word that I said.

[01:47:12.890 --> 01:47:14.670]
I had to dump myself on Wednesday, by the way.

[01:47:14.770 --> 01:47:15.350]
Big dump.

[01:47:16.810 --> 01:47:18.590]
11.56, four minutes till noon.

[01:47:18.590 --> 01:47:21.190]
So I'll play the, uh, new into one intro.

[01:47:21.190 --> 01:47:21.850]
And then you can play that.

[01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:22.250]
You got it.

[01:47:22.410 --> 01:47:22.750]
Got it.

[01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:25.730]
And we get the, uh, we got the NFL draft.

[01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:26.790]
How's our pool coming here?

[01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:29.850]
I know I'm sure that, uh, be 537 votes.

[01:47:29.970 --> 01:47:30.750]
It's slowing down a little bit.

[01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:32.110]
We got to get the kick that thing up there.

[01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:36.450]
We got to get to 700 by and, uh, one o'clock to keep being a boy happy.

[01:47:37.330 --> 01:47:41.310]
Which of these things do you care about the least 537 votes?

[01:47:41.690 --> 01:47:42.950]
Harness racing 154.

[01:47:43.210 --> 01:47:43.750]
Georgia sex fantasies.

[01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.910]
114.

[01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:47.430]
Moe Howard, David, 76.

[01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:49.330]
Florida, Marlon's 55.

[01:47:50.050 --> 01:47:52.190]
Uh, Scott Lacey Peterson, 53.

[01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:53.350]
Santa Cappale, 43.

[01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.770]
The NFL draft.

[01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:57.010]
It was the late edition, but it's already up to 16 votes.

[01:47:57.610 --> 01:48:00.210]
Arbor time radio ratings 13 and politics 13.

[01:48:00.210 --> 01:48:00.950]
Got it.

[01:48:01.210 --> 01:48:01.690]
Got it.

[01:48:02.050 --> 01:48:02.630]
Climb on it.

[01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:06.230]
I'll tell you about a place you ought to climb your feet into when that's Brandy shoes and

[01:48:06.230 --> 01:48:06.750]
Pomp of the Beach.

[01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:07.970]
What wonderful folks these are.

[01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:09.370]
Give your friendly personal service.

[01:48:09.690 --> 01:48:10.990]
They know your feet inside and out.

[01:48:11.150 --> 01:48:14.870]
And this year, Brandy is celebrating their 25th year in the shoe business in South Florida.

[01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:17.910]
Well, I've said we got, we got Halipondi Act 35 years.

[01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:19.610]
We got Brandy shoes 25 years.

[01:48:19.810 --> 01:48:21.350]
And you're truly 27 years.

[01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:22.750]
Which means a lot of us are getting old.

[01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:24.750]
But number two, somebody must be doing something right.

[01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:28.690]
I know Brandy's is because they offer you an unbeatable, great selection of top name brands.

[01:48:28.690 --> 01:48:33.370]

[01:48:33.690 --> 01:48:35.630]
Clarks, S.A.S. Floreshaw, and all the other top names.

[01:48:36.090 --> 01:48:39.670]
And if you got little teeny tiny feet or big, big fat ones, they can handle you.

[01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:44.890]
Because they got men's size of 6 to 15 and women's 5 to 12 and they make sure and very narrow to very wide feet as well.

[01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:48.650]

You A.M.

[01:49:17.370 --> 01:49:24.950]
I'm from O'Elia and I like running my smelly gorilla ass with soap made from shoes.

[01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:28.990]
And listening to the near okay, I'm gonna use the hour.

[01:49:29.130 --> 01:49:29.750]
Take I hand.

[01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:36.250]
I think we're calling Mrs. T. Toine. I'm out here.

[01:49:36.610 --> 01:49:42.750]
I just picked up my 92 accord from your life and it is on shoes turd in the back seat.

[01:49:43.190 --> 01:49:43.770]
Are you stirred?

[01:49:44.210 --> 01:49:44.510]
Yes.

[01:49:45.550 --> 01:49:47.250]
And there's one in the back seat?

[01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:53.150]
I'm a turd. A piece of a big ass human turd in the back seat of my car.

[01:49:53.150 --> 01:49:56.530]
Ma'am, I assure you our guys did not take it dump in your car.

[01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:59.250]
If you want to bring that car back and we'll take a look at it.

[01:49:59.290 --> 01:50:01.390]
You, oh, you want to take a look at it.

[01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:04.650]
My car is fine. It's that big ass turd in the back seat.

[01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:06.130]
Okay. What would you like me to do?

[01:50:06.450 --> 01:50:10.530]
I said, okay. How about I go to your house and pick a loaf on your car? How about that?

[01:50:10.810 --> 01:50:13.090]
Ma'am, what would you like me to do to fix the situation?

[01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:17.870]
I want somebody to come over here, get this turd out my back seat.

[01:50:18.030 --> 01:50:19.090]
That's not gonna happen.

[01:50:19.650 --> 01:50:20.790]
What do you mean it's not gonna happen?

[01:50:20.790 --> 01:50:23.030]
You can bring the car here and we can take a look at it.

[01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:25.350]
I am. I'm gonna bring it back there. You know what I'm gonna do?

[01:50:25.710 --> 01:50:29.150]
I'm gonna take the dump in every last car you got there.

[01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:32.690]
I'm gonna peel your counter. I'm gonna do it all.

[01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:33.270]
Okay.

[01:50:33.390 --> 01:50:34.370]
Just tell you how it feels.

[01:50:34.810 --> 01:50:35.050]
Okay.

[01:50:35.050 --> 01:50:36.950]
And you know what? You sound like a big girl in there.

[01:50:37.130 --> 01:50:38.370]
That probably came out your way.

[01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:42.790]
Oh, yeah. I don't make it happen to go on and take a dump in the car.

[01:50:42.810 --> 01:50:43.690]
How much do you weigh?

[01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:45.650]
About 400 pounds.

[01:50:45.670 --> 01:50:47.670]
That's your turd. That's my turd.

[01:50:48.110 --> 01:50:49.990]
That came from a 400 pound man.

[01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:51.790]
This is a 400 pound man.

[01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:52.990]
Either that or gorilla.

[01:50:53.530 --> 01:50:58.870]
I'm driving this car right to my lawyer's office and I'm gonna let the whole world see.

[01:50:58.990 --> 01:51:00.710]
You gonna be on the news this evening, buddy.

[01:51:01.170 --> 01:51:02.930]
I'm gonna get seven on my side.

[01:51:03.150 --> 01:51:04.590]
What? You gonna be on the news?

[01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:07.130]
Can you describe the...

[01:51:07.130 --> 01:51:09.030]
I'm gonna see what it is.

[01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:10.870]
You know what it is? It came out your ass.

[01:51:11.970 --> 01:51:14.910]
What the hell? You were kind of asking me what color.

[01:51:15.150 --> 01:51:17.030]
I tell you what, it smells ungodly.

[01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:18.190]
That's what it smells like.

[01:51:18.690 --> 01:51:21.110]
It smells like you sold your ass to the devil.

[01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:23.090]
I don't even know if it's a hell.

[01:51:23.630 --> 01:51:25.110]
What the hell, baby? How long is it?

[01:51:25.410 --> 01:51:26.970]
It's not as long as my arm.

[01:51:28.630 --> 01:51:29.890]
I don't think it's fun.

[01:51:30.090 --> 01:51:31.370]
Why y'all? This is not fun.

[01:51:31.530 --> 01:51:34.730]
I got a damn two-bar four and my back feet.

[01:51:35.650 --> 01:51:36.290]
You know, I think this is...

[01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:37.950]
I think this is racial shit too.

[01:51:38.330 --> 01:51:39.110]
That's what this is.

[01:51:40.710 --> 01:51:43.370]
A little kid is running away from it.

[01:51:43.370 --> 01:51:46.370]
Oh my...

[01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:50.430]
I'm gonna go find this funny.

[01:51:51.550 --> 01:51:52.590]
Oh, okay.

[01:51:53.770 --> 01:51:54.810]
You're probably...

[01:51:54.810 --> 01:51:56.470]
...for the fair and wheel suit, don't you?

[01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:57.570]
All right, all right.

[01:51:58.070 --> 01:52:00.110]
How long does it look like it's been sitting there?

[01:52:00.810 --> 01:52:02.850]
Steve is coming off of it, okay?

[01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:07.730]
Steve, Steve is coming off of it?

[01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:08.210]
Yeah.

[01:52:08.210 --> 01:52:08.250]
Steve is coming off of it!

[01:52:09.610 --> 01:52:12.670]
Steve is coming off of it, okay?

[01:52:14.530 --> 01:52:17.470]
I am taking this piece of fresh dirt.

[01:52:18.010 --> 01:52:18.310]
Okay.

[01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:22.390]
What you need to do is you need to bring that dirt back.

[01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:24.250]
And we'll match it up.

[01:52:24.330 --> 01:52:25.110]
We have a line up.

[01:52:25.150 --> 01:52:28.790]
We'll match it up with the other turns that we have.

[01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:31.970]
Well, what you need to do is learn how to use a toy.

[01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:33.970]
We're saying I can bring the dirt back to me?

[01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:35.710]
No. You know what?

[01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.610]
Is this a sample?

[01:52:36.610 --> 01:52:39.610]
No. I'm starting to like it.

[01:52:39.970 --> 01:52:41.290]
You're gonna keep it as a fact?

[01:52:41.490 --> 01:52:42.250]
Well, keep it.

[01:52:42.730 --> 01:52:43.830]
Because it's a nice...

[01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:44.530]
You know what?

[01:52:44.730 --> 01:52:46.230]
It's a nice conversation, please.

[01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:47.710]
Okay, cool.

[01:52:48.110 --> 01:52:48.190]
Okay.

[01:52:48.410 --> 01:52:48.870]
Hey, thanks.

[01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.750]
Oh, thanks.

[01:52:50.250 --> 01:52:51.470]
I hate you daddy.

[01:52:51.710 --> 01:52:52.630]
Daddy, you suck.

[01:52:52.890 --> 01:52:53.810]
Eat my shorts.

[01:52:54.330 --> 01:52:54.930]
Get it?

[01:52:56.790 --> 01:53:00.210]
There's two things I know for sure.

[01:53:00.490 --> 01:53:01.650]
Daddy, you're a loser.

[01:53:06.670 --> 01:53:09.050]
I look back on my pants.

[01:53:13.730 --> 01:53:16.070]
I think Mommy cheats on you.

[01:53:19.290 --> 01:53:21.610]
Well, if you're not a good friend,

[01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:29.310]
you're gonna stay a little wife like a loving girl.

[01:53:30.050 --> 01:53:32.090]
Hi, Samantha. I'm always here.

[01:53:32.610 --> 01:53:34.890]
Oh, I told you I'm done wrong.

[01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:37.570]
I must have done something wrong.

[01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:39.390]
Daddy, why don't you get a job?

[01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:42.770]
To deserve a hug every month.

[01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:47.070]
And what if I could see that night?

[01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:48.530]
Daddy, you smell like beer.

[01:53:53.070 --> 01:53:55.870]
Sweet 16 today.

[01:53:55.870 --> 01:53:57.790]
I'm dropping out of high school.

[01:53:58.890 --> 01:54:03.170]
A little more everyday.

[01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:04.630]
Daddy, I'm pregnant.

[01:54:04.930 --> 01:54:06.430]
One part one.

[01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:09.190]
The other part girl.

[01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:11.130]
I don't know who the father is.

[01:54:11.170 --> 01:54:12.730]
For women make up.

[01:54:13.490 --> 01:54:14.950]
For women's anchor.

[01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:17.410]
I have to turn tricks to cash.

[01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:22.910]
I drove the car into a tree.

[01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:26.750]
Can you just send me some cigarettes?

[01:54:30.150 --> 01:54:32.770]
Hey, how about a dose for the bride and groom?

[01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:38.730]
Daddy, I'm getting married again.

[01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:43.690]
And I'll give her away.

[01:54:43.890 --> 01:54:45.010]
Daddy, that's my ass.

[01:54:45.010 --> 01:54:49.290]
Standing in the bridegroom just staring at her.

[01:54:49.450 --> 01:54:51.030]
I think I have syphilis.

[01:54:58.830 --> 01:55:05.010]
Hey, Pop. We're moving in.

[01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:13.590]
Dad, I asked news. I'm a lesbian.

[01:55:13.590 --> 01:55:15.390]
A ride.

[01:55:15.710 --> 01:55:17.810]
This is a 506 WQA.

[01:55:18.450 --> 01:55:20.750]
I'm glad you refacted this article about the sugar industry.

[01:55:21.650 --> 01:55:24.590]
Yes, threatens to scupper WHL.

[01:55:24.750 --> 01:55:29.030]
I love the sugar industry.

[01:55:29.330 --> 01:55:31.970]
I'm going to inject four gallons of sugar into my vein.

[01:55:32.290 --> 01:55:33.070]
Sugar water right now.

[01:55:33.730 --> 01:55:34.390]
Just as a protest.

[01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:35.130]
Do you want to know why?

[01:55:35.470 --> 01:55:38.590]
Because of the WHO sucks.

[01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:42.730]
If you had any idea that they're saying right now,

[01:55:42.850 --> 01:55:44.650]
it's just watching here, which I said I'm going to hit that button.

[01:55:44.770 --> 01:55:44.910]
Sorry.

[01:55:45.690 --> 01:55:49.110]
But this is the effect here is worse than 9.11.

[01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:50.810]
Nobody coming here.

[01:55:52.510 --> 01:55:54.630]
The hotel people, the hotels here are empty.

[01:55:54.890 --> 01:55:56.530]
You could chew the cannonball through them.

[01:55:57.750 --> 01:56:01.630]
The sugar industry in the US is threatening to bring the World Health Organization to WHO.

[01:56:13.090 --> 01:56:14.130]
It's a huge issue.

[01:56:14.130 --> 01:56:14.130]

[01:56:14.130 --> 01:56:14.130]

[01:56:14.130 --> 01:56:14.130]

[01:56:14.130 --> 01:56:14.130]

[01:56:14.130 --> 01:56:14.170]
It's a huge issue.

[01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:16.230]
It's a huge issue.

[01:56:16.330 --> 01:56:16.490]
It's a huge issue.

[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.550]

[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.550]

[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.550]

[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.550]

[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.550]

[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.550]

[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.550]

[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.550]

[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.550]

[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.790]
It's a huge issue.

[01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.790]

[01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.790]

[01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.790]

[01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:17.310]
It's a huge issue.

[01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:18.490]
It's a huge issue.

[01:56:19.170 --> 01:56:22.990]
It's a huge issue.

[01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:30.630]
It's a huge issue.

[01:56:33.330 --> 01:56:38.290]
The WHO's report on diet and nutrition including challenging its $406 million funding from the US.

[01:56:38.710 --> 01:56:38.870]
Aha.

[01:56:42.710 --> 01:56:47.810]
The industry is furious at the guidelines, which says that sugar should account for no more than 10% of a healthy diet.

[01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:52.850]
It claims that the review by international experts was which decided on the 10% limit of scientifically flawed,

[01:56:53.310 --> 01:56:57.730]
insisting that other evidence indicates that a quarter of our food and drink can take in safely consistent of sugar.

[01:56:57.730 --> 01:57:01.530]
They want 25% and the WHO, they're 10%.

[01:57:01.530 --> 01:57:05.170]
And as a matter of fact, if you go to a restaurant and eat more than 10% sugar,

[01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:08.270]
there's going to be some asshole from the WHO standing right next to you there.

[01:57:08.430 --> 01:57:11.430]
And it may end up just being naughty and nice to measure it.

[01:57:11.770 --> 01:57:12.610]
And you're sugar too.

[01:57:13.550 --> 01:57:14.130]
And you're like that.

[01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:16.630]
But your fascists is what they are.

[01:57:16.810 --> 01:57:18.050]
They're the health fascists.

[01:57:18.490 --> 01:57:20.070]
They don't know what God damn thing about health.

[01:57:20.250 --> 01:57:21.830]
They wouldn't know a healthy person that he spit on them.

[01:57:22.050 --> 01:57:23.050]
And I invite them all to do it.

[01:57:25.610 --> 01:57:26.890]
How's the pool coming to meet it?

[01:57:26.890 --> 01:57:27.770]
I mean, being boy.

[01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:31.270]
567 votes.

[01:57:31.370 --> 01:57:32.970]
We might make 700 this all you think so.

[01:57:33.850 --> 01:57:35.010]
It'll be tough, but we can do it.

[01:57:36.230 --> 01:57:41.130]
Which of these things do you care about the least is our pool today, our world famous pool?

[01:57:41.610 --> 01:57:45.470]
Let's see, did the WHO overreact to, that's what the rescuer on the city policy here.

[01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:46.630]
But I would like to see the results.

[01:57:47.450 --> 01:57:49.150]
Did they overreact the Toronto SARS problem?

[01:57:49.230 --> 01:57:49.950]
You bet they did.

[01:57:50.190 --> 01:57:51.510]
Yeah, overreact.

[01:57:52.330 --> 01:57:54.310]
They're putting a dagger through our hearts, baby.

[01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:58.890]
It wasn't bad enough to leave stumped to do it out on Tuesday and got their asses kicked right there and filthed off you.

[01:57:58.970 --> 01:57:59.730]
That wasn't bad enough.

[01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:01.490]
But they're right on the heels of that.

[01:58:01.670 --> 01:58:03.790]
I'm starting to wonder about this whole deal, you know what?

[01:58:04.690 --> 01:58:06.810]
Candidate not participating in the Iraq attack.

[01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:08.170]
Of course, almost nobody else did either.

[01:58:08.370 --> 01:58:08.990]
But nonetheless.

[01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:13.050]
And now all of a sudden, I mean, now we got to WH.

[01:58:13.490 --> 01:58:15.650]
Oh, thinking all over our joint.

[01:58:17.210 --> 01:58:18.810]
Harness racing 165.

[01:58:18.890 --> 01:58:20.150]
They care about that the least.

[01:58:20.730 --> 01:58:23.250]
Georgia's sex fantasies are strong second to 119.

[01:58:23.250 --> 01:58:25.570]
They are so tired of his desperation.

[01:58:26.350 --> 01:58:29.090]
In fact, I think they have to, you might as well get the operation.

[01:58:30.750 --> 01:58:31.290]
All right.

[01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:32.370]
A little late now.

[01:58:32.490 --> 01:58:32.610]
Yeah.

[01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:34.410]
Mohawar David at 78.

[01:58:36.730 --> 01:58:38.590]
Scott and Lacey Peterson 56.

[01:58:38.810 --> 01:58:39.990]
The Florida Marlins 55.

[01:58:40.170 --> 01:58:41.170]
They're like a middle of the pack.

[01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:42.050]
Come see, come saw.

[01:58:42.970 --> 01:58:44.530]
Stand at the playoffs 45.

[01:58:44.970 --> 01:58:46.290]
NFL draft is moving up 21.

[01:58:46.530 --> 01:58:47.890]
They're moving on up to the east side.

[01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:51.150]
Arbitron radio waiting 15 and politics 13.

[01:58:51.150 --> 01:58:54.230]
So if you go from the bottom up, actually the NFL draft, but it got on

[01:58:54.230 --> 01:58:54.730]
They're very late.

[01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:55.790]
We can't judge now.

[01:58:56.190 --> 01:58:58.650]
Because I know in the past we put that on the similar kind of a poll.

[01:58:58.790 --> 01:59:00.950]
The NFL draft they were puking from it, right?

[01:59:01.970 --> 01:59:02.270]
Yeah.

[01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:05.810]
Of course, that was back in the days when we had people were just part of these sports

[01:59:05.810 --> 01:59:06.410]
nerd audience.

[01:59:06.850 --> 01:59:07.850]
They're probably all gone.

[01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:13.610]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:59:14.230 --> 01:59:14.590]
WQIM.

[01:59:15.590 --> 01:59:16.390]
I am Neil.

[01:59:17.010 --> 01:59:17.670]
My name is Neil.

[01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:18.450]
Yeah.

[01:59:18.710 --> 01:59:19.350]
Is that going to be a nod?

[01:59:19.650 --> 01:59:20.290]
No material.

[01:59:20.290 --> 01:59:21.570]
I would you never know.

[01:59:22.490 --> 01:59:22.890]
WQIM.

[01:59:23.710 --> 01:59:24.110]
Neil.

[01:59:24.450 --> 01:59:24.850]
Yes, sir.

[01:59:25.410 --> 01:59:29.230]
I know this world is going to hell in a hand basket when minus six Uncle chicken wax

[01:59:29.230 --> 01:59:30.730]
and a pit edges wrong.

[01:59:33.490 --> 01:59:34.130]
What's all these?

[01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:34.350]
What?

[01:59:35.050 --> 01:59:35.390]
I don't know.

[01:59:35.490 --> 01:59:37.070]
Something about chicken crap and a pit.

[01:59:37.170 --> 01:59:37.810]
I don't know what he said.

[01:59:40.270 --> 01:59:44.670]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:59:44.670 --> 01:59:47.530]
I have no idea what the L.E. said when he was talking about, but it sounded very

[01:59:47.530 --> 01:59:47.970]
articulate.

[01:59:48.730 --> 01:59:50.270]
That was probably what's his name?

[01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.850]
John Juris.

[01:59:52.050 --> 01:59:52.730]
Does it sound like him?

[01:59:53.410 --> 01:59:53.590]
Sure.

[01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.810]
What?

[01:59:54.030 --> 01:59:54.630]
That was him.

[01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:58.130]
Oh, line nine is ringing away for the second time that we never give that number out.

[01:59:58.250 --> 01:59:59.170]
I don't even know what the number is.

[01:59:59.210 --> 01:59:59.630]
Don't tell them.

[02:00:00.050 --> 02:00:00.650]
Don't tell them.

[02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:02.190]
Line nine.

[02:00:02.330 --> 02:00:02.470]
Hello.

[02:00:02.910 --> 02:00:03.370]
Hey, Neil.

[02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:05.170]
That bit that you just played the butterfly kiss.

[02:00:05.250 --> 02:00:07.650]
This is a combination of funny and sad.

[02:00:08.070 --> 02:00:09.790]
Especially with this call because you're chronic.

[02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:10.890]
That's the guy to cause.

[02:00:10.990 --> 02:00:11.770]
That's who I was expecting.

[02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:14.630]
It's like he's got his own private line on the show.

[02:00:14.670 --> 02:00:15.130]
Oh, right.

[02:00:15.810 --> 02:00:16.630]
Get a life, brother.

[02:00:16.630 --> 02:00:18.150]
Get a life or just get a brother.

[02:00:19.090 --> 02:00:21.030]
Or better yet, maybe get a sister and a brother.

[02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.970]
Have a three way.

[02:00:23.190 --> 02:00:23.950]
W-Q-A-M.

[02:00:25.350 --> 02:00:26.070]
You're straight.

[02:00:27.410 --> 02:00:28.170]
W-Q-A-M.

[02:00:28.770 --> 02:00:31.750]
Yeah, I wanted to talk to see either George or.

[02:00:32.730 --> 02:00:34.370]
You wanted to talk to see either George.

[02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:36.030]
I want to talk to you.

[02:00:36.170 --> 02:00:36.850]
The George and Neil.

[02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:37.990]
What do you want to talk about?

[02:00:38.050 --> 02:00:40.290]
I'm going to see the next Matrix movie.

[02:00:41.670 --> 02:00:43.450]
What are they going to make the next Matrix movie?

[02:00:43.450 --> 02:00:46.690]
If they want you guys, they're going to see the next Matrix movie.

[02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:47.090]
No.

[02:00:48.190 --> 02:00:49.150]
Are George either?

[02:00:49.730 --> 02:00:50.030]
No.

[02:00:50.650 --> 02:00:51.690]
What happened to George?

[02:00:51.950 --> 02:00:52.590]
He's not smoking a wine?

[02:00:52.710 --> 02:00:53.230]
He's not into it.

[02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:54.050]
He hates it.

[02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:57.230]
Well, every one day he'll be back.

[02:00:57.730 --> 02:00:58.250]
Sorry, man.

[02:01:02.050 --> 02:01:03.290]
You crushed him.

[02:01:03.450 --> 02:01:04.570]
You mean he manned.

[02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:05.750]
He's going to be okay.

[02:01:06.010 --> 02:01:06.690]
He's going to be okay.

[02:01:06.770 --> 02:01:08.610]
He knows that you'll be the first one online.

[02:01:08.970 --> 02:01:09.370]
Matrix won.

[02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:10.190]
Matrix five.

[02:01:10.330 --> 02:01:10.970]
Matrix a hundred.

[02:01:11.290 --> 02:01:12.470]
He's driving to the bridge.

[02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:13.970]
You don't make time George is going to watch.

[02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:15.470]
That's right.

[02:01:15.670 --> 02:01:16.130]
So just relax.

[02:01:16.350 --> 02:01:17.110]
Don't go to the bridge.

[02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.610]
Don't jump.

[02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:18.270]
You're a young man.

[02:01:18.510 --> 02:01:18.710]
Felly.

[02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:20.010]
You have your whole life ready of Pally.

[02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:20.410]
Up there.

[02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:21.150]
Don't do it too late.

[02:01:21.930 --> 02:01:23.550]
Like I said, get his whole life behind him.

[02:01:24.810 --> 02:01:26.570]
1213 at 560 WQM.

[02:01:26.630 --> 02:01:28.830]
I'll tell you a place where you can get a new attitude on life.

[02:01:28.930 --> 02:01:29.850]
And that is the pizza law.

[02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:30.570]
What a great combination.

[02:01:30.910 --> 02:01:32.750]
Fresh, delicious, incredible food,

[02:01:33.250 --> 02:01:34.910]
giant portions and teeny tiny prices.

[02:01:35.110 --> 02:01:36.130]
And great friendly service too.

[02:01:36.210 --> 02:01:37.110]
An ice informal atmosphere.

[02:01:37.470 --> 02:01:38.290]
What's not to like?

[02:01:38.690 --> 02:01:40.450]
And Jeff don't even have the ponytail anymore.

[02:01:40.450 --> 02:01:42.290]
Let's hear it for our good, close personal friend.

[02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:44.150]
I finally reformed her after all he has said,

[02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:47.290]
you know, if you're going to run restaurants, it is so unappetizing.

[02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:49.490]
First of all, what those painted fingernails looks like, hell,

[02:01:49.610 --> 02:01:50.450]
it looked like a freak.

[02:01:50.810 --> 02:01:53.830]
And that ponytail, you know, I mean, people know the food is great.

[02:01:53.850 --> 02:01:55.330]
We've been talking about these guys forever.

[02:01:56.150 --> 02:01:59.390]
But the ponytail just leaves a certain unappetizing feel.

[02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.970]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:02:00.410 --> 02:02:00.830]
What are you saying?

[02:02:01.330 --> 02:02:02.610]
I just, it's a good move.

[02:02:02.810 --> 02:02:03.630]
He cut it off.

[02:02:04.170 --> 02:02:07.350]
In fact, if he was smart, he wouldn't stop there based on what we're hearing about him.

[02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:09.450]
But anyway, the food is sensational.

[02:02:09.610 --> 02:02:09.990]
You love it.

[02:02:10.030 --> 02:02:11.750]
The portions like I tell you are fresh and delicious.

[02:02:12.170 --> 02:02:13.210]
Everything is cooked already.

[02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:15.890]
Won't get any rubbery spaghetti at the pizza loft or anything else.

[02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:17.410]
They got four, they're not.

[02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:18.750]
Are they still doing the massive pizza or not?

[02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:19.270]
I guess not.

[02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:22.330]
Like I said, they got three great pizzas.

[02:02:22.830 --> 02:02:24.830]
They got your New York style, your fixer's chicken,

[02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:28.990]
and your fogas of pizza extra spicy with onions and a special sauce.

[02:02:29.330 --> 02:02:31.510]
They got all kinds of Italian dishes that you love.

[02:02:31.730 --> 02:02:32.710]
Chicken and veal, seafood.

[02:02:33.050 --> 02:02:34.330]
They have calzone, super subs.

[02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:35.610]
Every kind of pasta out of the sun.

[02:02:35.610 --> 02:02:39.470]
The most incredibly delicious, drippy garlic rolls you've ever popped in your purse.

[02:02:39.810 --> 02:02:40.770]
Two pizza loft locations.

[02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:45.750]
On university drive in Davy between Griffin and 595 for delivery and take out on catering there

[02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:47.610]
called 9-5-4-916-8880.

[02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:51.050]
It's right behind Perlund imports, kitty corn of the new Armadillo Cafe.

[02:02:51.650 --> 02:02:54.050]
9-5-4-916-8880.

[02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:57.690]
And the new pizza loft location with the same great food and unbeatable meals

[02:02:57.690 --> 02:03:00.730]
is on a corner of Navihill and Sunrise right behind Walgreens.

[02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:04.450]
It's a little hidden there, but it's worth finding it because the food is just as sensational.

[02:03:04.450 --> 02:03:10.490]
9-5-4-3-8-2-1999 is the number and plantation for take out for delivery and whatever else you want to do in there.

[02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:14.590]
9-5-4-3-8-2-1999 for the world famous pizza loft.

[02:03:16.330 --> 02:03:18.190]
9-5-4-916-8880.

[02:03:18.190 --> 02:03:19.530]
This is sports waiting for bicycle.

[02:03:20.230 --> 02:03:21.150]
You weigh up.

[02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.710]
It's day!

[02:03:24.710 --> 02:03:31.250]
It's a Miami Town pierced at 5.6-0 WQA.

[02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:40.630]
I think my turn is crying.

[02:03:43.710 --> 02:03:47.370]
Hothor and Hothor is burning right through my rope.

[02:03:47.370 --> 02:03:50.370]
HONOR Eemases

[02:03:55.250 --> 02:04:01.450]
Please display me a little which way to go.

[02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:06.650]
Be streamer you butter him toilorets.

[02:04:06.650 --> 02:04:17.150]
The Brokenelectronic hosted militant lunch walked about 11 AM in winter.

[02:04:17.150 --> 02:04:18.810]
Just the blood to put the

[02:04:18.810 --> 02:04:19.210]
blood to put the

[02:04:19.210 --> 02:04:21.650]
blood to put the

blood to put the

[02:04:26.050 --> 02:04:26.730]
blood to put the

[02:04:26.730 --> 02:04:26.730]

[02:04:26.730 --> 02:04:28.990]
blood to put the

[02:04:28.990 --> 02:04:29.150]
blood to put the

[02:04:29.150 --> 02:04:29.450]
blood to put the

[02:04:30.230 --> 02:04:30.830]
blood to put the

[02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:31.030]
blood to put the

[02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.030]

[02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.550]
blood to put the

[02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:32.270]
blood to put the

[02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:34.370]
blood to put the

[02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:36.450]
blood to put the

[02:04:38.210 --> 02:04:39.150]
blood to put the

[02:04:39.150 --> 02:04:45.950]
blood to put the

[02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:54.970]
blood to put the

[02:04:54.970 --> 02:04:55.050]
blood to put the

[02:04:55.050 --> 02:04:55.110]
blood to put the

[02:04:55.110 --> 02:04:55.150]
blood to put the

[02:04:55.150 --> 02:04:55.150]

[02:04:55.150 --> 02:04:55.150]

[02:04:55.150 --> 02:04:55.150]

[02:04:55.150 --> 02:04:55.150]

[02:04:55.150 --> 02:04:58.390]
blood to put the

[02:05:07.230 --> 02:05:11.350]
blood to put Baron

[02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.370]
Expert

[02:05:11.370 --> 02:05:15.490]
between houses

[02:05:15.490 --> 02:05:15.930]
mit a

[02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:15.930]

[02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:15.930]

[02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:15.930]

[02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:15.930]

[02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:15.930]

[02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:15.930]

[02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:15.930]

[02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:17.970]
And you can put the turd in there too if you like.

[02:05:18.190 --> 02:05:20.550]
They'll probably intercept the customs and sniff it.

[02:05:20.810 --> 02:05:21.430]
Well, it's still steaming.

[02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:22.350]
Is it really?

[02:05:22.750 --> 02:05:22.750]

[02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:26.130]
And old Israeli Iraq oil line reopening,

[02:05:26.490 --> 02:05:29.290]
question mark, the Christian science monitor asks,

[02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:33.430]
nothing could be better designed to undermine the coalition's promise

[02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:35.450]
that Iraq's oil should benefit its own people,

[02:05:35.890 --> 02:05:37.610]
than Israel's proclaimed wish to reopen

[02:05:37.610 --> 02:05:40.670]
a long unused pipeline from Iraq's turkook oilfields

[02:05:40.670 --> 02:05:42.670]
to Israel's Mediterranean port of Haifa.

[02:05:43.190 --> 02:05:44.490]
This is an update on the story we had

[02:05:44.490 --> 02:05:47.090]
the two other stories earlier last week or two.

[02:05:48.170 --> 02:05:50.950]
Israel's national infrastructure minister Joseph Perrisky

[02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:53.530]
was quoted in a March 31st to Arret's article saying

[02:05:53.530 --> 02:05:55.930]
that Israeli and Jordanian officials would soon meet

[02:05:55.930 --> 02:05:57.630]
to discuss reviving the line.

[02:05:59.630 --> 02:06:01.810]
Built by the British in the 1940s,

[02:06:01.810 --> 02:06:03.090]
the line crossed West from Iraq

[02:06:03.090 --> 02:06:05.770]
through Jordan to British rule Palestine, today's Israel.

[02:06:06.210 --> 02:06:07.850]
Upon the 1948 birth of Israel

[02:06:07.850 --> 02:06:09.490]
and the immediate eruption of war with Iraq,

[02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:12.010]
Jordan and other Arab neighbors forced its shutdown

[02:06:12.010 --> 02:06:15.350]
and the version of Iraqi oil through a branch line to Syria.

[02:06:16.850 --> 02:06:19.770]
Arabs reacted with predictable fury to Mr. Perrisky's suggestion

[02:06:19.770 --> 02:06:22.290]
that the oil of a post Hussein Iraq had floated

[02:06:22.290 --> 02:06:25.070]
the Jewish state to be consumed or marketed from there.

[02:06:25.990 --> 02:06:28.190]
Jordan's information minister instantly declared the story

[02:06:28.190 --> 02:06:29.190]
about Israel Jordan meetings,

[02:06:29.190 --> 02:06:31.890]
devoid of truth because Jordan's relations with Israel

[02:06:31.890 --> 02:06:33.050]
are now very cold.

[02:06:33.690 --> 02:06:36.310]
Chile, despite the wishful thinking

[02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:38.070]
among President Bush's neo-conservator

[02:06:38.070 --> 02:06:39.450]
and pro-Israel advisers,

[02:06:39.450 --> 02:06:42.010]
a post Hussein Iraq is unlikely voluntarily

[02:06:42.010 --> 02:06:43.390]
to war Mr. Shiroin's government.

[02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:48.150]
Since 1948, Israel and Iraq have been implacable foes

[02:06:48.150 --> 02:06:49.950]
unlike Egypt, Jordan or Syria.

[02:06:50.130 --> 02:06:51.710]
Iraq has never been willing even to discuss

[02:06:51.710 --> 02:06:53.950]
an artist with Israel let alone a peace accord

[02:06:53.950 --> 02:06:55.970]
like those Israel signed with Egypt and Jordan.

[02:06:56.270 --> 02:06:58.090]
This despite some wishful mediation attempts

[02:06:58.090 --> 02:06:59.790]
by the U.S. and other Western business interests

[02:06:59.790 --> 02:07:01.290]
during Sodom's presidency,

[02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:03.550]
when he was our puppet, when we liked him a lot.

[02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:06.930]
Technically, Baghdad has been a continuous state of war

[02:07:06.930 --> 02:07:08.270]
with Israel since 1948,

[02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:09.970]
it kind of like us in the North Korea.

[02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:14.130]
It sent armies to fight Israel in 1948 and 1967

[02:07:14.130 --> 02:07:14.990]
in the backup series,

[02:07:15.290 --> 02:07:17.710]
Defense of Damascus in the October 73 war.

[02:07:18.090 --> 02:07:19.830]
It has supported several Palestinian guerrilla

[02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:20.870]
and terrorist organizations

[02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:23.130]
and during the current Palestinian-Tafada

[02:07:23.130 --> 02:07:26.010]
who signed subsidized families of Palestinian suicide bombers

[02:07:26.010 --> 02:07:27.130]
and other activists as we know,

[02:07:27.530 --> 02:07:28.910]
Israeli officials have been rejoicing

[02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:30.530]
over the West-led war coalescence elimination

[02:07:30.530 --> 02:07:33.510]
of Iraq as a principal strategic foe of the Jewish state.

[02:07:33.650 --> 02:07:33.970]
Oy!

[02:07:34.370 --> 02:07:34.890]
Never less.

[02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:38.730]
The authoritative Cyprus oil journal,

[02:07:38.970 --> 02:07:40.610]
Middle East economic survey, MIS.

[02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:42.750]
Remember Ed MIS?

[02:07:43.450 --> 02:07:44.870]
Yep, as in MISKID.

[02:07:45.490 --> 02:07:47.310]
Reports that the Washington Hawks may insist

[02:07:47.310 --> 02:07:48.910]
that the next Iraqi government rebuild

[02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:50.290]
the Kirkuk-Hifa oil line,

[02:07:50.610 --> 02:07:52.890]
probably with major U.S. firms.

[02:07:53.250 --> 02:07:54.250]
Uh oh, uh oh.

[02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:54.950]
Uh oh.

[02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:57.330]
Walid Kaduri, the MIS editor,

[02:07:57.530 --> 02:07:59.330]
explains that the idea actually involves building

[02:07:59.330 --> 02:08:01.350]
a whole new pipeline because the old one

[02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:03.670]
has been cannibalized and dismantled over the years,

[02:08:03.670 --> 02:08:06.050]
leaving no more than its old route traced on maps.

[02:08:06.050 --> 02:08:07.910]
This would add at least a billion dollars more

[02:08:07.910 --> 02:08:09.510]
to post-war financial burdens.

[02:08:09.670 --> 02:08:11.530]
And of course, we know where that money would go, don't we?

[02:08:11.650 --> 02:08:12.970]
Absolutely correct.

[02:08:13.090 --> 02:08:13.350]
Right.

[02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:15.710]
The idea is economically tempting for Israel

[02:08:15.710 --> 02:08:16.590]
and some of its friends,

[02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:20.070]
especially those whose firms might profit from such a project.

[02:08:20.710 --> 02:08:23.730]
Oil poor Israel MIS reports wants high quality Kirkuk crew

[02:08:23.730 --> 02:08:25.110]
with for its high-fair refinery.

[02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:27.830]
Israeli refinery is currently used Russian, West African,

[02:08:28.250 --> 02:08:29.650]
Egyptian, and other crude oils.

[02:08:30.570 --> 02:08:32.550]
Politically, the scheme is a potential bomb.

[02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:35.230]
Its implementation could ignite a new explosion

[02:08:35.230 --> 02:08:36.550]
in the chain of reactions to the U.S.

[02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:37.810]
invasion and occupation of Iraq,

[02:08:38.250 --> 02:08:39.490]
now beginning to reverberate

[02:08:39.490 --> 02:08:40.970]
throughout the troubled Middle East.

[02:08:41.210 --> 02:08:41.750]
How do you like that?

[02:08:41.850 --> 02:08:43.490]
The Christian science monitor, no less.

[02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:44.430]
Huh?

[02:08:46.410 --> 02:08:46.950]
Y'all.

[02:08:48.610 --> 02:08:50.890]
Bush election drive the 10th, 911 memories.

[02:08:51.050 --> 02:08:54.970]
This is so sickening and so transparent and so obvious.

[02:08:55.110 --> 02:08:58.030]
And the morons out there, the ditto heads,

[02:08:58.190 --> 02:08:59.130]
the masses are going to say,

[02:08:59.390 --> 02:09:00.070]
oh, that's great.

[02:09:00.650 --> 02:09:01.190]
You go, boy.

[02:09:03.610 --> 02:09:06.470]
The Republican Party is scheduled its 2004.

[02:09:06.810 --> 02:09:08.270]
This is from the UK Guardian.

[02:09:08.670 --> 02:09:11.190]
I should point out, not from your weekly reader in South Florida.

[02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:15.090]
The Republican Party is scheduled its 2004 convention

[02:09:15.090 --> 02:09:16.570]
unusually late in the year,

[02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:18.290]
so that the climactic moment

[02:09:18.290 --> 02:09:20.350]
when President Bush's reelection campaign begins,

[02:09:20.650 --> 02:09:22.510]
will nearly coincide with the third anniversary

[02:09:22.510 --> 02:09:24.350]
of the 911 attack when he report yesterday.

[02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:28.650]
The New York Convention in late August release of temper next year

[02:09:28.650 --> 02:09:30.770]
will mark the formal launch of the reelection campaign,

[02:09:30.770 --> 02:09:33.290]
but unofficially the campaign has already started

[02:09:33.290 --> 02:09:34.370]
with the war in Iraq,

[02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:35.550]
barely over the presence begun,

[02:09:35.670 --> 02:09:37.610]
holding rallies in key swing states.

[02:09:38.610 --> 02:09:40.990]
Its central aim has become clear to bridge the gap

[02:09:40.990 --> 02:09:43.370]
between Mr. Bush's popularity as a wartime leader

[02:09:43.370 --> 02:09:45.490]
and the National Ambulance started domestic policies,

[02:09:45.930 --> 02:09:48.470]
a political chasm which the Democrats will seek to exploit.

[02:09:48.810 --> 02:09:50.130]
How's the market doing, by the way, today?

[02:09:50.190 --> 02:09:51.390]
George, I just mentioned that in passing,

[02:09:51.710 --> 02:09:53.650]
since we're talking about the other aspect of what the

[02:09:53.650 --> 02:09:54.590]
alignment of it all down.

[02:09:54.810 --> 02:09:55.450]
Oh, no.

[02:09:56.510 --> 02:09:59.250]
The Dow's down 102 and the Aztecs down 14.

[02:09:59.850 --> 02:10:01.670]
Oh, it's for feeling mighty low.

[02:10:03.330 --> 02:10:05.410]
I just again mentioned that only in passing.

[02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:08.090]
The guiding philosophy underlying the campaign

[02:10:08.090 --> 02:10:10.350]
is the avoidance of mistakes made by the President's papa,

[02:10:10.350 --> 02:10:11.750]
who won the 91-Galph War,

[02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:13.190]
but was voted out of office largely

[02:10:13.190 --> 02:10:15.110]
because he was viewed as unconcerned

[02:10:15.110 --> 02:10:16.130]
with the plight of the economy.

[02:10:16.910 --> 02:10:18.270]
It's the economy stupid.

[02:10:19.310 --> 02:10:22.110]
The strategy this time will be to focus on domestic economics

[02:10:22.110 --> 02:10:23.450]
and to make sure the glow of victory

[02:10:23.450 --> 02:10:25.630]
and awareness of continuing peril do not fade.

[02:10:26.490 --> 02:10:29.230]
In New York, Mr. Bush will deliver his keynote address

[02:10:29.230 --> 02:10:31.830]
accepting the Republican nomination on September the 2th,

[02:10:32.130 --> 02:10:33.450]
just two months before the election

[02:10:33.450 --> 02:10:36.430]
and the latest acceptance in the party's 148-year history

[02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:39.590]
only nine days before the third anniversary of 9-11,

[02:10:40.210 --> 02:10:40.810]
September 2.

[02:10:41.950 --> 02:10:44.310]
The choices of venues for his post-war appearances

[02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:45.810]
has also been loaded with symbolism.

[02:10:46.150 --> 02:10:47.550]
He celebrated the liberation of Iraq

[02:10:47.550 --> 02:10:49.550]
and defended his tax cuts at a Boeing jet fighter

[02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:50.770]
platinum Missouri last week.

[02:10:51.170 --> 02:10:52.870]
This week, he'll speak at a factory in Ohio

[02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:55.530]
and other swing state that builds the Abrams tank,

[02:10:55.810 --> 02:10:57.830]
which helped to win the Iraqi Warsaw rapidly,

[02:10:58.190 --> 02:11:00.370]
explicitly making the link between the Warren Jobs.

[02:11:01.290 --> 02:11:03.330]
The US economy has lost two million jobs

[02:11:03.330 --> 02:11:04.470]
since he took office.

[02:11:04.910 --> 02:11:06.150]
Let me read that last line again.

[02:11:06.490 --> 02:11:08.370]
The US economy has lost two million jobs

[02:11:08.370 --> 02:11:09.910]
since W took office.

[02:11:10.610 --> 02:11:12.350]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[02:11:14.570 --> 02:11:16.990]
26 past noon at 560 WQM,

[02:11:16.990 --> 02:11:18.650]
if you ever thought about getting you a wireless phone

[02:11:18.650 --> 02:11:19.470]
like everybody else,

[02:11:19.550 --> 02:11:20.730]
while if you're waiting out there,

[02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:21.350]
what are you waiting on?

[02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:23.210]
Because you gotta know how valuable it is

[02:11:23.210 --> 02:11:24.870]

[02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:15.550]
Line in local,

[02:12:15.930 --> 02:12:18.490]
your sports radio 560-QAM,

[02:12:21.250 --> 02:12:22.570]
young is too young.

[02:13:07.690 --> 02:13:10.010]
Why some great stuff on the thing this week, you know?

[02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.590]
Yep.

[02:13:11.210 --> 02:13:12.570]
1231 if I say so myself,

[02:13:12.630 --> 02:13:13.570]
of course you're just gonna agree

[02:13:13.570 --> 02:13:15.110]
because he already knows he's got Carlos

[02:13:15.110 --> 02:13:17.370]
Beanabor hovering over his carcass there.

[02:13:18.090 --> 02:13:18.630]
You know,

[02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:20.270]
is here all the stories about your performance

[02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:22.050]
two weeks ago, Beanabor, you're not fooling anybody.

[02:13:23.130 --> 02:13:24.150]
617 votes on a poll,

[02:13:24.290 --> 02:13:25.610]
which of these things do you care about the least?

[02:13:25.730 --> 02:13:26.930]
I think we got a shot at 700.

[02:13:28.750 --> 02:13:30.530]
We got a half an hour for 83 more.

[02:13:30.630 --> 02:13:31.390]
Do you think that's possible?

[02:13:32.170 --> 02:13:33.930]
I'm gonna go around to other computers in the studio.

[02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:36.690]
Which of these things do you care about the least?

[02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:38.290]
Harness racing 179,

[02:13:38.530 --> 02:13:40.270]
I'll bet to the late Lou Williams is upset about that

[02:13:40.270 --> 02:13:41.790]
and Georgie Williams do and clearance

[02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:44.590]
A out in Jerry Vanfield and Wayne Temple.

[02:13:46.130 --> 02:13:48.990]
Georgia's sex fantasy is 126 enough already with the ass.

[02:13:49.750 --> 02:13:50.950]
Moe Howard David at 81,

[02:13:51.490 --> 02:13:52.350]
Florida Marlon 65,

[02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:54.710]
they're moving on up to the East side

[02:13:54.710 --> 02:13:56.350]
and hopefully a do East far.

[02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:58.930]
Scott Lacey Peterson 62 right in the middle,

[02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.450]
they're middling.

[02:14:00.170 --> 02:14:01.650]
Stanley Cup playoffs 47,

[02:14:01.770 --> 02:14:03.290]
NFL draft is all the way up to 27.

[02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:04.510]
It's zoom in up there.

[02:14:04.930 --> 02:14:06.350]
Arbitron radio ratings only 16

[02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:07.850]
and politics only 14.

[02:14:08.230 --> 02:14:09.090]
How do you like them apples?

[02:14:09.690 --> 02:14:12.430]
So you look from the bottom up

[02:14:12.430 --> 02:14:13.470]
so they're obviously concerned

[02:14:13.470 --> 02:14:14.550]
about those radio ratings

[02:14:14.550 --> 02:14:17.150]
and naturally we've nurtured that concern 618.

[02:14:17.150 --> 02:14:18.910]
Only one more vote while I was talking

[02:14:18.910 --> 02:14:20.050]
and that's not going to do it, you know.

[02:14:20.910 --> 02:14:22.330]
That's not going to cut it.

[02:14:23.290 --> 02:14:24.370]
These people just, you know,

[02:14:24.450 --> 02:14:25.610]
when you need them the most,

[02:14:25.690 --> 02:14:26.490]
well, we'll find out tomorrow

[02:14:26.490 --> 02:14:27.650]
if they're there when we need them the most.

[02:14:27.770 --> 02:14:28.510]
The most important thing.

[02:14:28.830 --> 02:14:29.630]
That's what really counts.

[02:14:29.850 --> 02:14:31.090]
All the rest is just window dressing

[02:14:31.090 --> 02:14:32.490]
like a game of roulette tomorrow.

[02:14:32.830 --> 02:14:33.310]
That's right.

[02:14:33.450 --> 02:14:34.570]
All depending on where they fell.

[02:14:34.890 --> 02:14:35.710]
What's your take folks?

[02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:36.990]
Who's going to take the pipe tomorrow

[02:14:36.990 --> 02:14:38.390]
and who's going to come out with shining colors

[02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:39.350]
when those ratings come out

[02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:40.850]
from our Arbitron and Bellsville, Maryland

[02:14:40.850 --> 02:14:41.770]
at 11.30 tomorrow.

[02:14:41.890 --> 02:14:42.890]
Let's see if Arbitron comes out

[02:14:42.890 --> 02:14:44.150]
with another bogus story, huh?

[02:14:44.730 --> 02:14:45.970]
Like you did that crap that report

[02:14:45.970 --> 02:14:47.290]
they had about the American public

[02:14:47.290 --> 02:14:48.290]
that survey they took.

[02:14:48.430 --> 02:14:49.750]
The American public is happy

[02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:50.650]
with a radio selection

[02:14:50.650 --> 02:14:51.730]
because they're sucking up

[02:14:51.730 --> 02:14:52.750]
to the people of Clear Channel

[02:14:52.750 --> 02:14:54.510]
because they got 240 stations

[02:14:54.510 --> 02:14:56.310]
and they're their biggest subscriber.

[02:14:56.610 --> 02:14:57.930]
Who are you people, kid at Arbitron?

[02:14:57.950 --> 02:15:00.050]
You better have some real serious numbers tomorrow, okay?

[02:15:00.350 --> 02:15:02.150]
And I'll be throwing it as a point minus tomorrow

[02:15:03.250 --> 02:15:04.730]
because you didn't fool us in December.

[02:15:04.930 --> 02:15:05.770]
You didn't fool us in January.

[02:15:05.930 --> 02:15:07.150]
And then they try to make up for it in February.

[02:15:07.150 --> 02:15:08.170]
You know how you're always talking

[02:15:08.170 --> 02:15:08.950]
they try to compensate.

[02:15:09.210 --> 02:15:10.490]
Right. They're always overacting.

[02:15:10.610 --> 02:15:11.790]
After I ripped them and asked,

[02:15:12.410 --> 02:15:13.830]
I think we're going to have the FBI

[02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:15.730]
dig tracing all the other dicks on your ass

[02:15:15.730 --> 02:15:17.510]
if we don't get a real serious book tomorrow

[02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:19.490]
to you guys in Beltsville.

[02:15:19.930 --> 02:15:22.050]
I think they've been talking to Tom Jicke too much.

[02:15:22.350 --> 02:15:23.970]
Of course, you know anything about local radio

[02:15:23.970 --> 02:15:24.990]
and more because you don't know radio.

[02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:27.210]
Head upon his radio and sell one of his kids.

[02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:30.190]
Well, times are tough at the hero.

[02:15:30.370 --> 02:15:31.670]
Then should we read that article a few weeks ago?

[02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.110]
Right.

[02:15:32.630 --> 02:15:33.810]
That bleeding heart article about,

[02:15:33.810 --> 02:15:34.730]
well, times are tough.

[02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:36.090]
We don't have anybody here that works here.

[02:15:36.270 --> 02:15:37.390]
Oh, that's right. He's a disgusting sentence.

[02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.950]
Same difference.

[02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:40.210]
What an embarrassing piece of crap that was.

[02:15:40.490 --> 02:15:42.430]
Now, guy that writes at the hair was it Jim DeFeedy?

[02:15:43.570 --> 02:15:46.110]
Jim DeFeedy, self-defeatist about, well,

[02:15:46.350 --> 02:15:48.210]
you know, we can't pay anybody and we suck now.

[02:15:48.290 --> 02:15:50.070]
We used to be great, but you know, that's where it is.

[02:15:50.330 --> 02:15:52.190]
That was one of the most embarrassing,

[02:15:52.210 --> 02:15:53.090]
even though it was very honest,

[02:15:53.410 --> 02:15:55.070]
pieces of trash that have ever been put

[02:15:55.070 --> 02:15:55.730]
in the major newspaper.

[02:15:56.570 --> 02:15:58.230]
And I use the term major newspaper loosely

[02:15:58.230 --> 02:15:58.970]
to speak into the hero.

[02:16:00.150 --> 02:16:02.690]
Referring to the pending suppresses on TomPain.com,

[02:16:02.830 --> 02:16:04.350]
referring to the pending Supreme Court case

[02:16:04.350 --> 02:16:06.970]
on Texas is so-called homosexual conduct law.

[02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:09.590]
Pennsylvania Senator Republican Rich Sandtormson

[02:16:09.590 --> 02:16:10.370]
and AP interview.

[02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:12.950]
If the Supreme Court says that you have the right

[02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:14.650]
to consensual gay sex within your home,

[02:16:14.930 --> 02:16:15.970]
then you have the right to beg me.

[02:16:16.090 --> 02:16:16.910]
You have the right to pull me.

[02:16:17.010 --> 02:16:17.770]
You have the right to insist.

[02:16:18.150 --> 02:16:19.150]
You have the right to adultery.

[02:16:19.230 --> 02:16:19.710]
All right.

[02:16:20.010 --> 02:16:20.870]
You have the right to anything.

[02:16:21.290 --> 02:16:21.910]
Later in the interview,

[02:16:22.070 --> 02:16:23.710]
Senator Amsturham said it all comes from I would argue

[02:16:23.710 --> 02:16:25.450]
that this right of privacy that doesn't exist

[02:16:25.450 --> 02:16:27.710]
in my opinion in the United States Constitution,

[02:16:28.190 --> 02:16:29.770]
whether it's polygamy, whether it's adultery,

[02:16:29.910 --> 02:16:31.090]
where it's sold to me, all of those things

[02:16:31.090 --> 02:16:33.730]
are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family.

[02:16:35.050 --> 02:16:37.310]
Senator Rich Sandtorms remarks comparing

[02:16:37.310 --> 02:16:39.290]
the protection of Americans privacy in their own homes

[02:16:39.290 --> 02:16:40.750]
to protecting bigamean incest,

[02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.910]
came as a disappointment,

[02:16:42.090 --> 02:16:43.510]
but sadly not as a surprise.

[02:16:44.310 --> 02:16:46.490]
Sandtorms record demonstrates a history of hostility

[02:16:46.490 --> 02:16:47.670]
toward equal rights for all Americans,

[02:16:48.030 --> 02:16:50.210]
and that hostility is reflected in the attitudes

[02:16:50.210 --> 02:16:51.390]
of the Republican Party leaders

[02:16:51.390 --> 02:16:54.010]
and many of the judicial nominees of President Bush.

[02:16:55.970 --> 02:16:57.790]
Sandtorm is an opportunity to apologize

[02:16:57.790 --> 02:16:59.090]
for these insensitive comments.

[02:16:59.170 --> 02:17:01.250]
Instead, he claimed that his comments were in keeping

[02:17:01.250 --> 02:17:03.210]
with his belief that everyone is equal

[02:17:03.210 --> 02:17:04.110]
under the Constitution.

[02:17:04.710 --> 02:17:06.990]
It is evident from his record that this is not the case.

[02:17:06.990 --> 02:17:08.750]
The White House and Sandtorms colleagues

[02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:10.910]
in the GOP leadership also chose to maintain

[02:17:10.910 --> 02:17:12.990]
their silence on Sandtorms attack on equal rights.

[02:17:13.250 --> 02:17:14.610]
They should repudiate his comments

[02:17:14.610 --> 02:17:16.230]
and affirm an inclusive vision of America

[02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:19.010]
where privacy and equal rights are guaranteed for all.

[02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:22.930]
Since 2001, Sandtorm with the President's blessing

[02:17:22.930 --> 02:17:25.490]
has worked to include language specifically authorizing

[02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:27.170]
discrimination into a piece of so-called

[02:17:27.170 --> 02:17:28.810]
faith-based legislation.

[02:17:29.510 --> 02:17:31.210]
Sandtorm previously admitted that he wanted

[02:17:31.210 --> 02:17:32.910]
to allow religious organization to be able

[02:17:32.910 --> 02:17:34.730]
to take public funds, but still discriminate

[02:17:34.730 --> 02:17:35.690]
against gay people.

[02:17:35.690 --> 02:17:37.810]
Fortunately, despite Sandtorm's position

[02:17:37.810 --> 02:17:39.950]
as third highest-ranking Republican in the Senate leadership,

[02:17:40.350 --> 02:17:42.050]
he was forced to remove his divisive provisions

[02:17:42.050 --> 02:17:43.710]
from the final version passed in the Senate.

[02:17:44.850 --> 02:17:46.310]
Sandtorm's record closely matches

[02:17:46.310 --> 02:17:48.530]
that of other far-right ideologues,

[02:17:48.530 --> 02:17:50.050]
Alabama Attorney General William Prior,

[02:17:50.210 --> 02:17:51.530]
who's one of President Bush's troubling

[02:17:51.530 --> 02:17:53.050]
federal appeal score nominees,

[02:17:53.550 --> 02:17:55.590]
is his state's Amicus Curie-I brief.

[02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:57.550]
In his state's Amicus Curie-I brief

[02:17:57.550 --> 02:17:58.830]
to the Supreme Court in the Texas case,

[02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:00.210]
equated the right of gay Americans

[02:18:00.210 --> 02:18:02.370]
to engage in consensual sex within their own homes,

[02:18:02.650 --> 02:18:04.950]
to activities like prostitution, adultery,

[02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:07.290]
necrophilia, bistiality,

[02:18:07.390 --> 02:18:08.290]
positionate child pornography,

[02:18:08.430 --> 02:18:09.610]
even insistent pedophilia.

[02:18:11.230 --> 02:18:12.550]
The comments of Sandtorm spokesperson

[02:18:12.550 --> 02:18:14.310]
that he has no problem with gay lesbian,

[02:18:14.530 --> 02:18:17.150]
bisexual or transgender individuals, rings hollow.

[02:18:18.390 --> 02:18:20.250]
Sandtorm describes gay people as a threat

[02:18:20.250 --> 02:18:21.250]
to healthy families.

[02:18:21.690 --> 02:18:23.030]
His records of supporting discrimination

[02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:24.430]
through charitable choice legislation

[02:18:24.430 --> 02:18:26.490]
and his opposition to hate crimes legislation

[02:18:26.490 --> 02:18:28.730]
demonstrate instead that Sandtorm believes

[02:18:28.730 --> 02:18:30.230]
gay Americans don't deserve full equality

[02:18:30.230 --> 02:18:31.070]
with other Americans.

[02:18:32.130 --> 02:18:33.390]
The silence from the White House

[02:18:33.390 --> 02:18:36.130]
and Republican Party leaders about Senator Sandtorm's comments

[02:18:36.130 --> 02:18:38.370]
combined with Bush's troubling judicial nominees

[02:18:38.370 --> 02:18:40.550]
and his executive order supporting discriminatory

[02:18:40.550 --> 02:18:41.950]
hiring and religious institutions,

[02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:43.510]
all point to the high states

[02:18:43.510 --> 02:18:45.190]
in this summer's likely battle for the future

[02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:46.130]
of the Supreme Court.

[02:18:46.630 --> 02:18:48.350]
Will the next justice support

[02:18:48.350 --> 02:18:49.750]
privacy and equal rights for all?

[02:18:50.050 --> 02:18:50.870]
Or will these and other freedoms

[02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:53.190]
be restricted for generations to come?

[02:18:54.290 --> 02:18:57.150]
Ask Ralph Nees, president of People for the American Way

[02:18:57.150 --> 02:18:59.310]
in a column in Tompaine.com.

[02:19:00.670 --> 02:19:02.910]
Rick Sandtorm, man, how do you like that, huh?

[02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:07.190]
He's the homophobic chief, the HIC.

[02:19:09.550 --> 02:19:10.810]
Oh, I'd speak to the administrators

[02:19:10.810 --> 02:19:12.310]
and their good close personal friends.

[02:19:12.470 --> 02:19:14.990]
American troops arrested fighters of Ahmed Shulabi's US

[02:19:14.990 --> 02:19:16.730]
back to Iraqi National Congress yesterday

[02:19:16.730 --> 02:19:18.710]
after they were found looting abandoned homes

[02:19:18.710 --> 02:19:20.330]
of former members of Saddamur regime,

[02:19:20.450 --> 02:19:21.550]
regimes who say.

[02:19:24.090 --> 02:19:25.350]
Fighters of the group have been covered

[02:19:25.350 --> 02:19:27.810]
repeatedly while looting homes in an uncleven bag that

[02:19:27.810 --> 02:19:29.550]
were members of Saddam's bath party

[02:19:29.550 --> 02:19:32.330]
lived to US Army sergeant Rice Ivings,

[02:19:32.330 --> 02:19:33.330]
a serosoda florida.

[02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:36.290]
Yesterday soldiers from A company,

[02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:38.270]
third battalion, seventh infantry regiment,

[02:19:38.470 --> 02:19:39.830]
detained force-respected looters,

[02:19:40.170 --> 02:19:41.770]
graced in the group's desert camouflage uniforms

[02:19:41.770 --> 02:19:43.330]
and carrying rocket propelled grenades,

[02:19:43.710 --> 02:19:45.350]
the Ivings said the men who didn't speak English

[02:19:45.350 --> 02:19:47.390]
were taken away prisoner war detention center.

[02:19:50.210 --> 02:19:52.810]
Coming to find out that these are from Ahmed Shulabi,

[02:19:52.910 --> 02:19:54.430]
which should be no surprise since he was a criminal

[02:19:54.430 --> 02:19:55.350]
in Jordan anyway.

[02:19:55.490 --> 02:19:56.150]
He was an embezzler.

[02:19:56.770 --> 02:19:57.950]
And that's one of the people we send there

[02:19:57.950 --> 02:19:58.590]
to be the leader.

[02:19:58.830 --> 02:20:00.270]
He's been in Iraq for 40 years,

[02:20:00.410 --> 02:20:01.510]
but he never saw a freight train.

[02:20:02.030 --> 02:20:03.490]
His people are trying to steal everything else

[02:20:03.490 --> 02:20:04.290]
that ain't nailed down.

[02:20:05.870 --> 02:20:06.970]
Good to see that we're really

[02:20:06.970 --> 02:20:09.050]
no above board on all these things, you know what?

[02:20:09.430 --> 02:20:09.570]
Yeah.

[02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:12.230]
Got that Iraqi art that's showing up in the US,

[02:20:12.770 --> 02:20:14.690]
the box engineer that smuggled a whole bunch

[02:20:14.690 --> 02:20:15.390]
of crap back here.

[02:20:15.630 --> 02:20:17.330]
I bet your clumber bush would be proud of him.

[02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:20.690]
Just if you think he declared it,

[02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:21.430]
that custom said.

[02:20:23.650 --> 02:20:25.730]
Yeah, I wonder if he paid duty on it.

[02:20:25.830 --> 02:20:28.410]
I mean, he just do it down after they got nailed them.

[02:20:28.850 --> 02:20:30.310]
Probably do need a lot after that.

[02:20:31.950 --> 02:20:32.630]
639 votes.

[02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:35.510]
What do you think being a robot got 61 to go before 1 o'clock

[02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:37.290]
to give to 700 to magic at 640?

[02:20:38.410 --> 02:20:40.730]
60 to go in 21 or two minutes.

[02:20:41.390 --> 02:20:42.670]
Gonna have to really huh?

[02:20:43.230 --> 02:20:43.590]
Two per minute.

[02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:44.610]
It's doable.

[02:20:45.070 --> 02:20:46.010]
It's doable, baby.

[02:20:46.410 --> 02:20:47.430]
I have no idea why.

[02:20:47.550 --> 02:20:48.990]
We're nearly, I don't really care what the totals are

[02:20:48.990 --> 02:20:50.470]
because we've been getting a spectacular response

[02:20:50.470 --> 02:20:52.710]
on our websites since Carlos came in and salvaged

[02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:54.710]
to die and grotesque and biricing website.

[02:20:55.710 --> 02:20:57.630]
I really made it into something we can be proud of

[02:20:57.630 --> 02:21:00.130]
as opposed to the grotesque and biricing thing we had before

[02:21:00.130 --> 02:21:02.370]
that was ancient and outdated and just a lazy

[02:21:02.370 --> 02:21:03.330]
as piece of garbage.

[02:21:04.290 --> 02:21:05.570]
Hey, I'll tell you what, if you were lazy

[02:21:05.570 --> 02:21:06.970]
as you're big and fat, here's a place

[02:21:06.970 --> 02:21:09.730]
to enjoy tremendously the Emerald Coast Chinese buffet.

[02:21:09.970 --> 02:21:10.830]
Is the phone ringing yet, Carlos?

[02:21:12.410 --> 02:21:13.890]
I'm not gonna remember one Chinese buffet.

[02:21:14.010 --> 02:21:15.570]
In the world with three great South Florida locations,

[02:21:15.570 --> 02:21:17.170]
they're in sunrise, North by Maviche,

[02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:19.190]
and they're in the West Pemberpines location for you.

[02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:20.870]
When you've got a real healthy appetite,

[02:21:21.030 --> 02:21:22.110]
when you want to go out for an inexpensive

[02:21:22.110 --> 02:21:23.970]
but a very big delicious feast,

[02:21:24.370 --> 02:21:25.310]
the Emerald Coast is the place.

[02:21:25.470 --> 02:21:26.970]
Six different kinds of great soups.

[02:21:27.150 --> 02:21:29.070]
Zillions of suckling on trays have never actually counted

[02:21:29.070 --> 02:21:30.190]
to myself, but I guarantee you.

[02:21:30.470 --> 02:21:31.050]
Futsard, man.

[02:21:31.210 --> 02:21:32.130]
Probably lots more than that.

[02:21:32.250 --> 02:21:33.450]
Oriental surf and turf on the weekends,

[02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:35.250]
New York strip made a order in their gourmet center.

[02:21:35.490 --> 02:21:36.970]
That's a sizzling Asian grill

[02:21:36.970 --> 02:21:39.350]
of featuring teriyaki steak, shrimp chicken,

[02:21:39.550 --> 02:21:40.610]
seafood, hand carb, parmium.

[02:21:40.870 --> 02:21:42.510]
Let me say it again, cook the order the way you like it

[02:21:42.510 --> 02:21:42.970]
on her dog.

[02:21:43.370 --> 02:21:44.690]
And the Emerald Coast will never give you a headache

[02:21:44.690 --> 02:21:46.670]
because they don't use any crap when they cook all

[02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:47.250]
that great stuff.

[02:21:47.250 --> 02:21:50.070]
No MSG, no cornstarch, and they cook only

[02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:51.370]
with cholesterol free oils.

[02:21:51.770 --> 02:21:52.910]
They feature a full salad bar,

[02:21:53.010 --> 02:21:54.330]
new sushi bar and fresh room cocktail,

[02:21:54.590 --> 02:21:55.850]
and speaking of lobsters,

[02:21:56.670 --> 02:21:58.670]
Emerald Coast famous lobster fest is back,

[02:21:58.830 --> 02:22:00.690]
featuring lobster thermators and lobster bisque.

[02:22:01.090 --> 02:22:02.870]
And if you have any room, I always warn you,

[02:22:02.890 --> 02:22:04.530]
bring a crowbar and then stuff it in your pants

[02:22:04.530 --> 02:22:05.890]
and open up a little extra room

[02:22:05.890 --> 02:22:07.310]
for some of the goodies from the dessert bar.

[02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:08.970]
Because what a dessert bar it is,

[02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:10.870]
featuring pies and cakes, pastries,

[02:22:11.070 --> 02:22:12.070]
ice cream and all your favorite toppings,

[02:22:12.350 --> 02:22:14.730]
fresh fruit, they even be having watermelon all the time too.

[02:22:14.730 --> 02:22:17.410]
Emerald Coast in sunrise, Pine Island of 44th.

[02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:19.410]
I'm Collins Avenue just north of 163rd

[02:22:19.410 --> 02:22:20.070]
in North Miami Beach.

[02:22:20.370 --> 02:22:22.030]
And at the intersection of Flambengo and Pembroke Roads

[02:22:22.030 --> 02:22:23.970]

[02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:25.770]
takeout and delivery available as well,

[02:22:25.890 --> 02:22:29.050]
call 954-572-3822.

[02:22:29.170 --> 02:22:30.750]
Tell Richard at the Emerald Coast in sunrise,

[02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:32.090]
better luck for the least next year,

[02:22:32.210 --> 02:22:34.290]
okay Richard, don't feel too bad, but it was gross.

[02:22:35.330 --> 02:22:38.130]
954-572-3822, for the world famous,

[02:22:38.250 --> 02:22:40.550]
the outstanding unbeatable Emerald Coast Chinese buffet.

[02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:42.690]
My name is Michael.

[02:22:43.010 --> 02:22:43.330]
My name is Michael.

[02:22:43.330 --> 02:22:44.970]
This is Fort Real Fist City.

[02:22:45.350 --> 02:22:47.010]
You ain't too am.

[02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:50.610]
Good morning, chauffeur, thin skin.

[02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:52.110]
I wouldn't believe a word, Neil,

[02:22:52.270 --> 02:22:53.790]
said if his tongue was not right.

[02:22:53.890 --> 02:22:57.290]
Now, a statement from my raki tiktok titters, Adam Hussein.

[02:22:58.350 --> 02:23:00.030]
Kefasra, Kefasra, Mi Ambre.

[02:23:00.610 --> 02:23:01.330]
Boro, Boro, Boro, Boro, Boro.

[02:23:01.330 --> 02:23:03.870]
I want to let you know, I am still alive.

[02:23:03.930 --> 02:23:04.890]
Boro, Boro, Boro.

[02:23:04.910 --> 02:23:07.890]
No, I do have a bad sunburn on my shoulders

[02:23:07.890 --> 02:23:10.470]
on my poupou liro and my pavish region.

[02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:14.110]
I was laying out on my scubi dupelanket

[02:23:14.110 --> 02:23:16.550]
on the banks of the Euphrates

[02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:18.370]
and forgot my sunblock.

[02:23:18.930 --> 02:23:22.990]
Oh well, this is a personal message to America.

[02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:25.170]
Knock it off, huh?

[02:23:25.470 --> 02:23:27.210]
Enough already.

[02:23:28.090 --> 02:23:30.170]
I had to appear amongst my people

[02:23:30.170 --> 02:23:32.130]
and let them touch me.

[02:23:32.450 --> 02:23:34.190]
I hate when they touch me.

[02:23:34.590 --> 02:23:36.690]
Most of these people only cheer me

[02:23:36.690 --> 02:23:38.410]
because they know if they don't

[02:23:38.410 --> 02:23:40.310]
I'll go medieval underass.

[02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:43.050]
Just may seem like a strange request.

[02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:46.210]
Now that you've taken on my palace and bagged that,

[02:23:46.390 --> 02:23:48.550]
do you think you could let me get in there

[02:23:49.330 --> 02:23:52.410]
for like 90 minutes so I can get some of my stuff?

[02:23:52.730 --> 02:23:55.330]
I have an extensive music collection

[02:23:55.330 --> 02:23:59.150]
that dates back to Sam the Shaman of Pharaohs.

[02:23:59.250 --> 02:24:00.170]
Flood, plush.

[02:24:00.370 --> 02:24:03.590]
I really want to get my hands on my original copy

[02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:05.030]
of Heard of the Moment.

[02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:12.390]
My Asia and my cast evens, greatest hits, a track tape.

[02:24:12.810 --> 02:24:14.530]
If it's not too much trouble,

[02:24:14.610 --> 02:24:16.710]
could you run into my bedroom for me?

[02:24:17.090 --> 02:24:19.730]
In my top dresser drawer, left side,

[02:24:19.810 --> 02:24:22.190]
under a giant old man under pants,

[02:24:22.470 --> 02:24:25.010]
I got a little thing with an extension cord

[02:24:25.630 --> 02:24:26.770]
that looks like a leaf of spinach.

[02:24:27.430 --> 02:24:28.530]
Don't get read it out.

[02:24:28.770 --> 02:24:32.470]
If you could, leave it out back in a small cardboard box.

[02:24:33.170 --> 02:24:34.050]
I'd appreciate it.

[02:24:34.050 --> 02:24:35.550]
All by the way.

[02:24:36.090 --> 02:24:37.790]
I like the new bachelor.

[02:24:38.530 --> 02:24:41.210]
He seems like a sensitive caring young man.

[02:24:41.390 --> 02:24:41.890]
Okay, bye.

[02:24:42.670 --> 02:24:42.830]
Bye.

[02:24:43.430 --> 02:24:44.610]
1246 and 560.

[02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:45.930]
I don't think we're gonna make it, be it a boy.

[02:24:47.330 --> 02:24:47.810]
Have faith.

[02:24:48.410 --> 02:24:50.410]
655 votes and we got 14 minutes to go, huh?

[02:24:50.890 --> 02:24:51.030]
Half faith.

[02:24:51.930 --> 02:24:53.390]
No, we're gonna take a humongue.

[02:24:53.450 --> 02:24:55.570]
Well, like I said, 43 more to go in 14 minutes.

[02:24:55.650 --> 02:24:57.350]
That's what, like three, a little over three a minute.

[02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:59.290]
I don't think we're gonna make it to 700.

[02:25:00.050 --> 02:25:01.630]
Which of these things do you care about the least

[02:25:01.630 --> 02:25:02.690]
on your Rogers.com?

[02:25:02.690 --> 02:25:03.870]
You can be among the greats

[02:25:03.870 --> 02:25:05.530]
and put us over 700 votes during the show,

[02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:06.810]
which we've done better than that before,

[02:25:07.010 --> 02:25:09.290]
but nevertheless, peanut boys ego depends on it.

[02:25:09.950 --> 02:25:12.050]
In fact, death might just turn them down tonight

[02:25:12.050 --> 02:25:13.310]
if you don't get with it.

[02:25:14.090 --> 02:25:16.710]
Harness racing 194, I say turn them down or turn them around.

[02:25:17.410 --> 02:25:17.790]
194.

[02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:19.530]
They don't wanna hear about that stuff.

[02:25:19.710 --> 02:25:20.390]
Sorry, Bruce Ranger.

[02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:21.250]
Sorry, Wally.

[02:25:22.410 --> 02:25:24.110]
Georgia's Sex Fantasy is 131.

[02:25:24.530 --> 02:25:27.130]
Moe Howard David in 83, Florida, Marlon 72,

[02:25:27.850 --> 02:25:29.130]
Scott Lacey Peterson 64,

[02:25:29.130 --> 02:25:32.770]
Stanley Cup Playoffs 51, NFL Draft 30, about 30.

[02:25:33.270 --> 02:25:35.850]
Arbiteron Radio Waiting 17, politics 15.

[02:25:36.650 --> 02:25:39.730]
Let me just refresh it one more time, real quick.

[02:25:41.550 --> 02:25:42.350]
It's refreshing.

[02:25:43.130 --> 02:25:43.650]
660.

[02:25:44.470 --> 02:25:46.130]
So we got 13 minutes and 40.

[02:25:46.250 --> 02:25:49.630]
It's like just a hair, just a little twisted curly hair

[02:25:49.630 --> 02:25:50.910]
over three votes a minute.

[02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:52.410]
We can do that, huh?

[02:25:53.090 --> 02:25:53.210]
Sure.

[02:25:54.030 --> 02:25:56.730]
Here's a fact from Chris who says I could definitely do

[02:25:56.730 --> 02:25:59.330]
without hearing Paul and young Ron's lame ass posing

[02:25:59.330 --> 02:26:00.810]
for their lame ass effing show.

[02:26:01.490 --> 02:26:03.130]
Since Paul steals everything else from your show,

[02:26:03.270 --> 02:26:05.330]
can you do the same with his exit from the airways?

[02:26:06.110 --> 02:26:07.150]
Paul should be ashamed of himself

[02:26:07.150 --> 02:26:08.890]
for playing Hogan's Heroes Drop-ins.

[02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:12.030]
My message for fat Paul is to exit from the effing year forever.

[02:26:12.310 --> 02:26:13.230]
Have a nice day, says Chris.

[02:26:13.950 --> 02:26:14.650]
Well, Chris, you are.

[02:26:14.770 --> 02:26:16.090]
Absolutely correct.

[02:26:16.410 --> 02:26:17.150]
Pretty lame, man.

[02:26:17.650 --> 02:26:18.670]
Of course, George likes that show.

[02:26:19.310 --> 02:26:19.470]
Yeah.

[02:26:20.090 --> 02:26:20.190]
What?

[02:26:20.490 --> 02:26:20.790]
Hogan's here?

[02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:22.310]
He's like hearing your material back over again.

[02:26:22.430 --> 02:26:23.490]
Now, he rotates that show.

[02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:24.330]
I like Hogan's Heroes.

[02:26:24.690 --> 02:26:25.730]
That's what I thought you were talking about.

[02:26:25.730 --> 02:26:27.790]
I was talking about the Paul and young Ron.

[02:26:27.990 --> 02:26:28.810]
And let me ask you this.

[02:26:30.990 --> 02:26:34.790]
560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Lime.

[02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:36.570]
We have just about successfully butchered out.

[02:26:36.670 --> 02:26:37.950]
I mean, kill off four hours here today.

[02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:40.130]
There's no big problem here in Toronto.

[02:26:40.130 --> 02:26:41.770]
Come ahead and have no fear whatsoever.

[02:26:42.410 --> 02:26:43.510]
This is all this below me.

[02:26:43.630 --> 02:26:45.930]
The W8 station only rotten hell of wicked.

[02:26:46.050 --> 02:26:47.350]
I think I've got 20 countries now.

[02:26:47.710 --> 02:26:48.570]
Not sending their people here.

[02:26:48.770 --> 02:26:50.110]
There's nobody croaking in the streets.

[02:26:50.250 --> 02:26:52.190]
Nobody walking around with the surgical mask.

[02:26:52.590 --> 02:26:54.510]
The only one we've seen with surgical masks is Greg Reed.

[02:26:55.530 --> 02:26:56.610]
And everything is fine.

[02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:57.550]
It's just fine.

[02:26:58.110 --> 02:26:59.270]
Oh, we're fine.

[02:26:59.390 --> 02:26:59.590]
Right.

[02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:02.990]
But the, like I said, we killed off the four

[02:27:02.990 --> 02:27:04.990]
because we were just building up to it tomorrow at 11.30.

[02:27:05.050 --> 02:27:07.990]
And these people, obviously, only 17 people said the least thing

[02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:09.350]
is the second last time.

[02:27:09.430 --> 02:27:10.210]
Listen, next to politics.

[02:27:10.770 --> 02:27:12.990]
So they're just dying to find out how we came out.

[02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:15.330]
And tomorrow morning 11.30 you'll find out.

[02:27:15.330 --> 02:27:17.830]
And of course with us whether they're good or bad or in between

[02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:19.710]
whatever it is we lay them right out there for you.

[02:27:19.770 --> 02:27:20.230]
We don't lie.

[02:27:20.370 --> 02:27:21.030]
We don't make them up.

[02:27:21.150 --> 02:27:22.370]
We don't try to like pretend.

[02:27:22.370 --> 02:27:24.510]
And well, if the moon would have been in Uranus,

[02:27:24.570 --> 02:27:25.750]
you know, whatever it is it is.

[02:27:26.290 --> 02:27:27.170]
Although I will say this.

[02:27:28.370 --> 02:27:28.730]
WDQIM.

[02:27:29.550 --> 02:27:29.930]
Oh, yeah.

[02:27:30.030 --> 02:27:30.610]
Dean and Sunrise.

[02:27:31.210 --> 02:27:31.690]
Yes, sir.

[02:27:31.870 --> 02:27:32.510]
Let's go to Sunrise.

[02:27:32.670 --> 02:27:32.790]
Hello.

[02:27:33.550 --> 02:27:33.990]
Hey, Neil.

[02:27:34.450 --> 02:27:34.590]
Yeah.

[02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:37.610]
I just moved down here and kind of want to tell me about this thing

[02:27:37.610 --> 02:27:38.350]
with Mickey Mouse.

[02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:39.870]
What's that Mickey Mouse thing?

[02:27:39.950 --> 02:27:41.050]
I just moved down here from Tennessee.

[02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:43.170]
You're not from Tennessee.

[02:27:43.690 --> 02:27:44.350]
I swear to God.

[02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:45.990]
I moved here for five years.

[02:27:46.090 --> 02:27:46.610]
I moved up there.

[02:27:46.630 --> 02:27:49.510]
I came back and I started with the thing with the Mickey Mouse.

[02:27:50.110 --> 02:27:50.650]
I'm here.

[02:27:51.050 --> 02:27:51.890]
Well, what do you mean?

[02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:52.950]
What's the thing with Mickey Mouse?

[02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:53.810]
I said it.

[02:27:54.010 --> 02:27:54.350]
That's it.

[02:27:54.490 --> 02:27:56.310]
Everybody in work keeps walking around the office going.

[02:27:56.530 --> 02:27:59.110]
I said, I said, what the hell is that?

[02:27:59.450 --> 02:28:01.090]
I have one thing for you to respond to them.

[02:28:01.090 --> 02:28:03.270]
Every time they say, I said, I come to get a life.

[02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:04.270]
All right.

[02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:05.450]
Good luck, you probably.

[02:28:05.650 --> 02:28:06.770]
OK, don't unpack.

[02:28:07.170 --> 02:28:08.510]
Why would anybody come back to South

[02:28:08.510 --> 02:28:09.430]
or what he was in Tennessee?

[02:28:10.190 --> 02:28:10.890]
I guess that's the place.

[02:28:11.250 --> 02:28:12.870]
And the people that work are obsessed with it.

[02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:20.630]
I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said,

[02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:22.050]
of course with him, it doesn't take much.

[02:28:22.890 --> 02:28:24.750]
Let's see, we got a shot, 678.

[02:28:24.850 --> 02:28:26.250]
We refreshed that baby one more time.

[02:28:26.250 --> 02:28:27.730]
We got 11 minutes and counting 11.

[02:28:28.010 --> 02:28:29.670]
Oh, yeah, I think we're picking up some steam,

[02:28:29.930 --> 02:28:30.370]
a beater boy.

[02:28:30.510 --> 02:28:31.090]
Told you have faith.

[02:28:32.050 --> 02:28:32.370]
684.

[02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:33.310]
Oh, we're going to make it.

[02:28:33.310 --> 02:28:34.810]
We only got 16 votes to go to seven.

[02:28:34.890 --> 02:28:35.730]
We got 10 minutes for that.

[02:28:36.130 --> 02:28:37.090]
Oh, my God.

[02:28:37.270 --> 02:28:38.250]
I told you, no sweat.

[02:28:38.410 --> 02:28:38.990]
Did not tell you that.

[02:28:39.370 --> 02:28:40.130]
You have little faith.

[02:28:40.410 --> 02:28:40.750]
Of course.

[02:28:41.130 --> 02:28:43.550]
I said on this highly rated, very popular show

[02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:45.050]
that used to be pretty good once upon a time

[02:28:45.050 --> 02:28:46.810]
many years ago when it was on a real radio station.

[02:28:47.490 --> 02:28:50.150]
And we still only had one guy to call about the IOD tape.

[02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.810]
We played before.

[02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:53.050]
Is that incredible or what?

[02:28:53.330 --> 02:28:53.810]
That's incredible.

[02:28:54.470 --> 02:28:56.210]
I thought that was pretty interesting stuff.

[02:28:57.190 --> 02:28:58.610]
But, look at how the wine is.

[02:28:58.630 --> 02:29:00.890]
Like I said before, don't question these people.

[02:29:01.010 --> 02:29:01.790]
They got their own agenda.

[02:29:02.130 --> 02:29:03.770]
They're on their own time table of life.

[02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:05.990]
Nothing we can do or say is going to bring them back to it.

[02:29:06.190 --> 02:29:08.650]
Unless maybe it's got to do with that might do it.

[02:29:08.690 --> 02:29:09.610]
That might turn them around.

[02:29:10.870 --> 02:29:13.190]
A lot of people turn a lot of other people around.

[02:29:13.470 --> 02:29:14.350]
Don't do it again, Carlos.

[02:29:14.630 --> 02:29:16.570]
Don't let the music up against the wall again.

[02:29:18.450 --> 02:29:21.030]
In addition to which, he's just a paper tiger now anyway.

[02:29:21.150 --> 02:29:22.050]
Tony, the paper tiger.

[02:29:22.830 --> 02:29:24.010]
He's just a paper tiger.

[02:29:24.470 --> 02:29:26.750]
Now we got a real program director, Clarence Darrow.

[02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.770]
Anybody seen him lately?

[02:29:28.690 --> 02:29:29.370]
It's on this morning.

[02:29:29.550 --> 02:29:30.430]
Oh, and guess what?

[02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:31.290]
What?

[02:29:31.730 --> 02:29:33.790]
Tomorrow is not only the day for the ratings,

[02:29:33.790 --> 02:29:35.810]
but tomorrow is the 25th.

[02:29:35.810 --> 02:29:36.790]
Hey, day for you.

[02:29:37.250 --> 02:29:39.010]
So I sure hope my check has been nailed already

[02:29:39.010 --> 02:29:41.150]
before they see the numbers if you catch my drift.

[02:29:41.350 --> 02:29:42.670]
It's always a good idea to get your paycheck first.

[02:29:43.070 --> 02:29:45.710]
Before the book comes out, they might kind of reevaluate things.

[02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:46.630]
You know what I'm saying, Moll?

[02:29:46.810 --> 02:29:47.170]
You get it?

[02:29:47.370 --> 02:29:47.730]
Good.

[02:29:48.830 --> 02:29:49.770]
Well, you talk about it.

[02:29:49.770 --> 02:29:50.850]
You got that steal on the check.

[02:29:51.850 --> 02:29:53.690]
1252 at 560 WQAM.

[02:29:53.690 --> 02:29:55.050]
Hey, listen, if you're at a dead end job,

[02:29:55.170 --> 02:29:55.750]
what a great segue.

[02:29:55.930 --> 02:29:56.290]
Thank you.

[02:29:56.770 --> 02:29:58.530]
And if you're working for peanuts like poor little

[02:29:58.530 --> 02:30:00.770]
peanut boy and they're in George, here's the answer for it.

[02:30:00.850 --> 02:30:02.250]
Get you a new high-paying computer job

[02:30:02.250 --> 02:30:04.430]
from the people who can do it in just four short months.

[02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:05.190]
Fast train.

[02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:06.090]
That's right.

[02:30:06.190 --> 02:30:07.770]
There's no excuse anymore because fast train

[02:30:07.770 --> 02:30:09.250]
has locations for it all over town.

[02:30:09.570 --> 02:30:10.010]
They're in Miami.

[02:30:10.010 --> 02:30:11.810]
They're in Kendall, Pember Pines for Lauderdale.

[02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:13.750]
And so there's about to be one nearby you.

[02:30:13.750 --> 02:30:15.510]
They've also got convenient day evening.

[02:30:15.570 --> 02:30:16.570]

[02:30:16.930 --> 02:30:18.570]
You can check them out on the web at fast train.com.

[02:30:18.690 --> 02:30:20.570]
But whatever you do, get out of your dead end job.

[02:30:20.690 --> 02:30:21.790]
There's no sense of working for peanuts

[02:30:21.790 --> 02:30:22.970]
when you can get some training.

[02:30:22.970 --> 02:30:24.570]
And just four short months, like I said,

[02:30:24.650 --> 02:30:26.670]
and be on a road to a high-paying computer job

[02:30:26.670 --> 02:30:28.890]
and get a big fat paycheck once or twice

[02:30:28.890 --> 02:30:29.890]
or whatever it had you get paid.

[02:30:30.290 --> 02:30:31.570]

[02:31:02.990 --> 02:31:03.770]
Oh, I don't think it is.

[02:31:03.950 --> 02:31:05.330]
But nevertheless, Carlos is pretty impressed.

[02:31:06.030 --> 02:31:06.950]
Is yours refreshed yet?

[02:31:07.230 --> 02:31:08.430]
I'm refreshing it manually.

[02:31:08.430 --> 02:31:10.830]
Oh my god, he's handling it manually.

[02:31:11.230 --> 02:31:11.930]
We got it.

[02:31:12.010 --> 02:31:12.490]
There it is.

[02:31:12.610 --> 02:31:13.010]
All right.

[02:31:13.210 --> 02:31:14.210]
Oh god, no.
