[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500]
I'm Larry King and they don't come any better than Neil Rodg

[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.960]
Slive in concert

[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.480]
Slive in concert is a little more

[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.300]
Re-buckets are now overdrive

[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.860]
El Gore and BGO

[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.280]
You ain't seen nothing yet

[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.320]
You ain't seen nothing yet

[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.980]
El Gore and Buck returner overdrive

[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.920]
With back up singer Larry King

[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.840]
You ain't seen nothing yet

[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.400]
It's gone for good shit

[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.560]
It's no I'd say to you tonight

[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.060]
And hear me well

[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.880]
You ain't seen nothing yet

[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.220]
Thank you very much

[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.700]
Thank you very much, I

[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.980]
I'm really proud and happy to be here

[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.700]
I'm with you

[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.780]
It's great to be back in Harlem

[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.160]
We shot basketball together one of the last times I was here

[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.640]
Howard Dean and I are traveling from here to Iowa

[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.100]
And I'm going to make a more extensive speech at Cedar Rapids

[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.380]
A little bit later today but

[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.280]
I said when I announced last year that I was not going to be a candidate for president myself

[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.440]
That I would endorse one of the candidates who is running

[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.560]
And I had no idea at that time which candidate that that would be

[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.100]
But I have watched this campaign

[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.540]
And I have listened to all of the candidates

[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.960]
I think it's a great field

[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.500]
There are a lot of great Democratic candidates out there

[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.700]
But what I'm about to say

[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.580]
Don't come as a secret or as a surprise to anybody within the sound of my voice

[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:13.440]
And that is that Howard Dean really is the only candidate who has been able to inspire at the grassroots level

[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.140]
All over this country the kind of passion and enthusiasm for democracy

[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.340]
And change and transformation of America that we need in this country

[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.780]
We need to remake the Democratic Party

[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.240]
We need to remake America

[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.860]
We need to take it back on behalf of the people of this country

[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.520]
So I'm very proud and honored to endorse Howard Dean to be the next president of the United States of America

[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.960]
Oh, right

[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.420]
Democracy is a team sport

[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:15.500]
And I want to do everything I can to convince the anybody that is interested in my judgment about who among these candidates have been

[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.840]
And as the best chance to win and the best chance to lead our country in the right direction

[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.140]
I want to do everything I can to convince you to get behind Howard Dean

[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.340]
And let's make this a successful campaign as a group

[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.520]
It is about all of us

[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.200]
And all of us need to get behind the strongest candidate

[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.520]
Now I respect the prerogative of the voters and the caucuses and in the primaries

[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.420]
And I'm just one person but I'm offering my judgment

[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.200]
And I'm also going to say one other thing here

[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:04.700]
Years ago former president Ronald Reagan said in the Republican Party that there ought to be an 11th commandment

[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:14.620]
No, no, ill of another Republican well now we're Democrats and we may not find that kind of commandment as accessible

[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.780]
But to the extent that we can recognize the stakes in America today

[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:29.700]
I would urge all of the other candidates and campaigns to keep their eyes on the prize

[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.680]
This nation cannot afford to have for more years of a bush chaining administration

[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:49.240]
We can afford to be divided among ourselves to the point that we lose sight of how important it is for America

[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:56.200]
What is going on in this bush white house today is bad for our country

[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.720]
And it's slowly beginning to sink in to more and more people out there

[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:15.280]
And we don't have the luxury of fighting among ourselves to the point where we seriously damage our ability to win on behalf of the American people this time around

[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:23.800]
Now one other thing I've spent a long time thinking about national security and national defense

[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:42.420]
And I've heard a lot of folks who in my opinion made a judgment about the Iraq war that was just plain wrong

[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:54.120]
Saying that Howard Dean's decision to oppose the Iraq war calls his judgment on foreign policy and the question will excuse me

[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.560]
He was the only major candidate who made the correct judgment about the Iraq war

[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.780]
And he had the insight and the courage to say and do the right thing

[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:16.020]
And that's important because those judgments that basic common sense is what you want in a present

[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:36.080]
Our country has been weakened in our ability to fight the war against terror because of the catastrophic mistake that the Bush administration made in taking us into war in Iraq

[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:45.860]
It was Osama bin Laden that attacked us, not Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein is a bad guy and he's better off not in power or all better off

[00:06:45.860 --> 00:07:02.180]
But it was a mistake to get us into a quagmire over there. So don't tell me that because Howard Dean was the only major candidate who was right about that war that that somehow calls his judgment into question on foreign policy

[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:15.440]
So whether it is inspiring enthusiasm at the grassroots and promising to remake the Democratic Party as a force for justice and progress and good in America

[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:26.960]
Whether it is a domestic agenda that gets our nation back on track or whether it is protecting us against terrorists and strengthening our nation in the world

[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:37.040]
I have come to the conclusion that in a field of great candidates, one candidate clearly now stands out

[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:46.580]
And so I'm asking all of you to join in this grassroots movement to elect Howard Dean President of the United States. Thank you.

[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.960]
You go, boy, and there you go. Where was that algo four years ago?

[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.880]
He made two great speeches since then and you wonder where was why didn't he speak like that four years ago?

[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.400]
Although I like the way Dean introduced him, he said is the elected president of the United States, which is correct.

[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.860]
That's correct. Yes it is.

[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:12.420]
And these fascists stole it right in broad daylight, right in front of your eyes right there in Florida. And when I say right in front of your eyes, I'm thinking of that one big eye, you know, the judge that was holding it ballad up with it hanging Chad and Palm Beach.

[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.940]
Google I Google eyes. Yeah, in fact you do a Google search and I'm Google wise.

[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:25.340]
So I'll go endorses Howard Dean and we're pretty pleased about that. We're pleased this punch on this show about that because Howard Dean the man.

[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.400]
I just hope hey Howard, don't be another Michael do caucus, please.

[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.160]
Oh God.

[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:36.860]
Now there I got to admit as much as I like Howard Dean, I think he's terrific, but I sometimes he has looks on his face that just I don't know.

[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.480]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.880]
But you'd have to try to be a do caucus though.

[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.340]
Would you? Yeah. Really?

[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.400]
A couple inches. He's kind of a shotgun anyway.

[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:51.240]
You'd have to get a slack jaw because well there was one thing about do caucus that bothered everybody right off the bat.

[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.700]
Oh, he's a little guy kind of funny looking.

[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.020]
Yeah.

[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.440]
He went up to your kneecap.

[00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:02.140]
Anyway, Terry Lester died thanks to one of our chronic factors for faxumission. I have no idea who that is.

[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.500]
After best known for his rules and soap operas, the young and a restless the young and a horny.

[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.420]
He was the original Jack Abbott, not this crime Jack that's on there now.

[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:22.840]
Santa Barbara is Mason cap well and as the world turns as your warm turns rice color appeared in prime time TV shows like star drag Voyager, Jag, Fag, Dallas and diagnosis murder died last week in December 1st at age 53.

[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.840]
Okay. Okay.

[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.960]
Because of the TV a.

[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:34.000]
Let's see how that pull come out yesterday not too many real religionists in this crowd of bars. Thank the Lord for that.

[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.480]
No, go. Excellent. Please just punch to see that too.

[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:43.940]
A lot of punching going on 1146 votes. How often do you attend religious services? Never.

[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.200]
649 56.6%. Oh, right. You go boys and girls.

[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:55.200]
Rarely 300 and 826.8%. You add those numbers together. You got 83.4%.

[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.300]
Rarely or never go to a shoulder to church to the mosque.

[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.200]
They might wear a mosque every now and then like to the mosque ball got a gas mosque.

[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:14.200]
Only on major holidays 90 7.8%. You add that if we're well over 90% and that leads fairly often 55 4.7%.

[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:22.400]
Probably through a lot of heavy pressure and brainwashing from their families and very often religiously 44 3.8%.

[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.780]
Almost definitely as a result of the above mentioned.

[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.560]
So that's you take the last two fairly often very often religiously you got 8.5%.

[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:35.880]
Which means 91.5% of people at all are like just about maybe once in a blue moon.

[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.140]
Speaking of blue moon. How's the Marcel's doing?

[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.740]
A big day today. Let me give you a hint.

[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.120]
Yep. Right. 60th birthday. Oh, and yes, who else is birthday? Let's do for both.

[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.260]
Okay. Okay. Big birthday today for Shelley Bloom.

[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.400]
And for Jim Morrison. The difference being Shelley still alive.

[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.660]
Jim Morrison would be 60 today. We got that story a little later on.

[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.560]
Rayman Zerick who's a real asshole was talking about it. You see him on there? Yeah. Yeah.

[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:11.060]
That's really quick. The pseudo intellectual Rayman Zerick. Well, you know, oh, I wish we still had that tape. You know, right?

[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.880]
I'm glad we don't because we play it. Just the sound of Rayman Zerick's voice. I mean a real sued.

[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.680]
In fact, if you look up pseudo intellectual dictionary Rayman Zerick's picture. There's no wonder Jim Morrison killed him.

[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.340]
So most people don't realize that he often he just write himself today.

[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.920]
Kind of like Ozzy Ozzy had a little bit of a problem. We got all kinds of heavy duty stuff today.

[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.600]
Here's the first pool and we'll take some suggestions along the way. We've done these recently, but it is the holidays.

[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.780]
And you know, if you expect me to come now, what are all those calls on there?

[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.160]
I will. Come in your Q.A.M.

[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.480]
I'll take some suggestions. One on me. Yes, sir.

[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:42.920]
Hi, your family.

[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.560]
That was good. Yeah. That was excellent. Was it?

[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:53.120]
Loved it. That sounded almost. Wait a minute. Listen. That was so close to the original.

[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.520]
Hi, your family.

[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.640]
No, he must have been playing off a tape. You think he could have done that good of a job?

[00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.100]
Sure. No.

[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.680]
There's hell and out there.

[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.640]
Hi, how are you?

[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.040]
That was the anxious fat boy. I'm almost sure.

[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.180]
Anyway, we'll get to a lot more great calls like that momentarily.

[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.520]
And first pool today in what city in the world you find the best looking people?

[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.300]
Prague Miami Toronto Boston or any other cities you want to add on there?

[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.820]
Those are the ones I have my short list.

[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.280]
Any arguments with any of those?

[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.180]
Well, I put Miami on there just because some people who never left college say that.

[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.080]
Just because. Yeah. 1013 at 560 WQ.

[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.120]
After years of failed attempted mergers with cable news channels.

[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:41.700]
Disney owned ABC has decided to launch their own 24 hour news channel.

[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.780]
Here's what it may sound like.

[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.840]
Good evening.

[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.220]
This is Emma's reporting from Orlando.

[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.320]
A cup story this evening.

[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.840]
Nine people were injured when they fell off the.

[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.700]
And it can be something else.

[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:10.040]
In other news, 4,000 people experienced explosive delivery on vomiting while disembarking the.

[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:31.800]
And then they were injured.

[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.000]

[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.000]

[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.000]

[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.000]

[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.000]

[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.000]

[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:32.820]
And then they were injured.

[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.520]
And then they were injured.

[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:40.020]
And then they were injured.

[00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:00.620]
And then they were injured.

[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:00.620]

[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:00.620]

[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:00.620]

[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:00.640]
And then they were injured.

[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:00.720]
And then they were injured.

[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.700]
And then they were injured.

[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.760]
And then they were injured.

[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:03.980]
And then they were injured.

[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.140]
And then they were injured.

[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.480]
The dog is going on.

[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.440]
I can't understand a word.

[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.340]
He said, anyway, you want more weather balls?

[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.860]
Go ahead, hurry up.

[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.540]
There's a storm coming in Orlando.

[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.080]
It looks like the weekend and shock.

[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.300]
The weekend and shock.

[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.260]
That's what I said.

[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.860]
Well, I'm more than who's after this.

[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.000]
All right.

[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.080]
Oh, man. Took a long time for him to come up with another one of those.

[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.160]
But it was worth waiting for.

[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.320]
Wouldn't that beautiful?

[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:34.980]
I love it. Love it.

[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.160]
The weekend and shock.

[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.320]
10, 19, 5, 60 WQM.

[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.520]
Okay, let's get some more cities for this list where you'll find the best looking people in the world.

[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.380]
And of course, a lot of you that never been more than 10 blocks from sweet water.

[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.240]
What do you even know?

[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:46.460]

[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.880]
We should have probably put sweet water on there.

[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.820]
Probably get a whole bunch of votes.

[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:50.400]
But we won't.

[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.820]
I just told Eric to add Spokane.

[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.060]
Spokane?

[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:53.660]
Washington.

[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:54.800]
Never been in Spokane.

[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.760]
Never been in the Great Northwest.

[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.640]
Beautiful, clean city, beautiful park in the middle of it and hot babes everywhere.

[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.200]
We should also probably put Cologne, Germany on there.

[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.580]
But nobody in this crowd has ever been there.

[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:03.840]
Wow.

[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:04.680]
Woo!

[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.140]
Man.

[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.620]
That'll just make you just a week at the knees when you see them people in Cologne, Germany.

[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.340]
You'll be running around going like that over here.

[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.140]
Wow.

[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.020]
Can that be felt?

[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:16.340]
Cologne, Germany.

[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.960]
C-O-L-O-G-N-E.

[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:18.380]
You got it?

[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:19.940]
Actually, they spelled it.

[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:20.580]
K-O-L-N.

[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.740]
But we're not going to do no choimin.

[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.560]
We have plenty enough time for that.

[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.500]
C-O-L-O-G-N-E.

[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:26.940]
Got it?

[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:28.840]
That's your way you spell it.

[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.320]
Cologne, Germany.

[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:30.760]
Got it.

[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.320]
Anyway, let's say.

[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.340]
And of course, the bearer, I told you the bear factory is right outside the city.

[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.460]
Oh, it's a beautiful thing.

[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:35.460]

[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.220]
They have this.

[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.840]
You will enjoy popping a couple of them every day.

[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.320]
W-Q-I-M.

[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.940]
Put the toy.

[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.140]
Who made you wear a board test and from that theater?

[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:45.760]
W-Q-I-M.

[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:45.920]
Hello.

[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:46.920]
Hey, Neil.

[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:47.420]
How you doing?

[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:48.020]
Pretty good.

[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.380]
Hey, you know, I just heard you're talking about religion.

[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.720]
I got to pay something really quick.

[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.480]
You know, I have a very close family.

[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.300]
I'm not a very religious person at all.

[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.300]
But my, well, certain members of my family have become very, very close.

[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:08.140]
And it's amazing what religion will do to a family that was close.

[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.600]
But we're still very close.

[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.600]
But the arguments that happen are incredible.

[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.040]
Oh!

[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.940]
I try to stay away from these conversations.

[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.660]
And I can't get out of them every time I talk with them.

[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.780]
Religion breeds hate.

[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:21.920]
Relive the retake.

[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:22.580]
Oh, yeah.

[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.860]
It's the topic of the conversation.

[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:24.540]
Because you're not asking.

[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.640]
You must believe whoever you're talking to.

[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.080]
You must believe they're for retails.

[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.320]
Otherwise, you just, you're not going to get saved.

[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.180]
And I mean, I listen to a lot of things you say.

[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.520]
And I know you jerk around a lot.

[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.360]
But I mean, a lot of them are so true.

[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.120]
And I bring it up.

[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:45.080]
And I get, I mean, you can't imagine what happens to me when I do, when I say the thing that you say.

[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.580]
But I truly believe it.

[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.780]
I don't know what to believe in.

[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.660]
You know, that's my attitude.

[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.900]
I don't know what to believe in.

[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.280]
But I'm not going to say, I mean, you don't know what to believe in.

[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.440]
Why do you have to believe in anything?

[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.880]
That's what that's true.

[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.300]
But I mean, the way they are about it, I mean, they're so, I mean, they don't sit me down.

[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.340]
And talk to me for like a half an hour to an hour.

[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.240]
And I just don't, I mean, they started talking about Noah's Ark the other day.

[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.720]
And I'm sorry.

[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.280]
I just, I, I, I, I, I, I...

[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.220]
Listen, let me adopt anybody over the age of eight who would believe with those fairy tales.

[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.820]
Noah's Ark and all the animals, two of all the animals.

[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.060]
I mean, believe a story like that has to be some kind of a moron.

[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.340]
They need psychiatric help.

[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.420]
They're, they're a simple dance.

[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.500]
God came down and told Noah.

[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.380]
Noah, forget about that.

[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.540]
He wasn't happy.

[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.280]
He wasn't happy.

[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.040]
He was just again at craft and capture all of the animals.

[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:32.820]
Forget about that.

[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.220]
But plus he was a drunk to top it all off.

[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:42.740]
But, but just keep in mind that here is a guy who, God, rather, who killed everything else.

[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.380]
In other words, everything else that couldn't get on the ark, they all died.

[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.100]
Even the animals.

[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.340]
I mean, all we needed was a male and a female and all the other species, which sounds pretty species to me.

[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.340]
And that was it.

[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.020]
Everything all the other animals died because I guess they were evil too.

[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.440]
Or maybe just God didn't really give a crap about him.

[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.500]
Well, it's not like God likes what Noah was drinking.

[00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.700]
So I'll have what he was having.

[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:00.440]
Evidently.

[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.420]
Tell him to get lost, man.

[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.360]
Tell him that they're full of.

[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.920]
And have a great day.

[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:05.460]
Thanks.

[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.780]
DNA, stew no harm.

[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.200]
That's all.

[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.900]
All these idiots, these peddlers of bull crap.

[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.740]
And because they want to control your mind.

[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.000]
They want to control everything you do.

[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.320]
Oh, the Bible says this.

[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.940]
And by the way, one dead 14 injured net to the theater of town theater the other day.

[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.120]
That asshole was talking about.

[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:20.640]
Yeah.

[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.960]
I wasn't in there too bad.

[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:22.420]
You lose.

[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.120]
I'm still here.

[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.780]
And I'll be here for a long time.

[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.400]
Three more excruciating years every day, except for those 30 weeks.

[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.400]
This vacation I get every year.

[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:29.680]
How many?

[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.620]
About 30, man.

[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.020]
That's right.

[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:36.920]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.960]
Miami 16 votes for the most beautiful people in the world.

[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.220]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.360]
Right.

[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.360]
They must be talking about cemetery village.

[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.460]
Maybe they're into old folks.

[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.000]
WQAM.

[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.900]
Hey, we talked to Neil, please.

[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:50.660]
Speaking.

[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.320]
Hello.

[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:54.860]
Yes.

[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:54.920]
Yes.

[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.580]
We are at the department of medical drug.

[00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.080]
Oh, God.

[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.160]
WQAM.

[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:00.360]
Hello.

[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:01.400]
Hey, I'm coming.

[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:01.960]
How are you doing?

[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:02.520]
Okay.

[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.060]
Hey, I'd like to add Salt Lake City to you.

[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.160]
Salt Lake City, Utah.

[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.780]
I bet it's real pristine and pretty.

[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.480]
The women are just the most beautiful women you've ever seen.

[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.960]
And you can take probably 20 or 30 of them and make them your wife.

[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.520]
No, they're gorgeous.

[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.520]
Absolutely gorgeous.

[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.180]
Unfortunately, I probably won't get too many votes because not so many people have been there.

[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.660]
You have to be a moron.

[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.960]
More men to believe that.

[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.140]
Fantastic place.

[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.300]
Okay, thanks, Pally.

[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:25.680]
Okay.

[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.420]
I'm not marking that on my list of places to see and do, though.

[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.360]
Salt Lake City, Utah.

[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:31.700]
Weeks.

[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.260]
Have you been there?

[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.060]
Yes, I have.

[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.340]
Or in Snatch, been there.

[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:36.620]
The city is very clean.

[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.220]
The Mormons are good looking people in case you hadn't noticed.

[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.100]
Yes, I have noticed.

[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.720]
The ones in the bicycles with the white shirts and the nice black ties.

[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:47.400]
And the, the, the, the, although I think if you wear that magic underwear too long, sir, get a little gimme.

[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.820]
That festering brine pit really smells.

[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.000]
Really?

[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:51.520]
Yeah.

[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.580]
Anyway, the people are pretty look at.

[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.380]
Okay, so get real outs on the outskirts of town up on a hill somewhere and just get some binoculars.

[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.300]
Miami 16 Toronto 5 Prague 5 Boston 1.

[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.880]
Colonies got one already spoke.

[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:07.680]
Can't just went on there.

[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.380]
What do we have now?

[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.360]
Salt Lake City.

[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:10.520]
Got to have a list.

[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.660]
We better get that list going pretty soon because we got to do the other one.

[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.640]
They were what we don't have to, but we will or maybe not.

[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.160]
We should.

[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.400]
We should what?

[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.700]
Do the other one.

[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:19.860]
Tomorrow.

[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:20.800]
Okay.

[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:22.900]
See, always hold something back.

[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:23.920]
There's a little lesson for you.

[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.200]
If something looks like it might because it's going to take a long time to build this one.

[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.660]
Man, we got to get a whole bunch of names on there.

[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.080]
It doesn't.

[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.280]
It doesn't have the, the scientific value that our pool usually has, you know, because this is very important crack.

[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.420]
It kills some very valuable time.

[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.120]
Bimbo's Portray Bush has a bozo.

[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.400]
Now that story coming up after the break.

[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.960]
Should I give you a little tease?

[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:44.680]
Could you?

[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:50.640]
A group of a group of women in southeastern Michigan say they'll use pictures of scantily clad babes.

[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.140]
All right.

[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:56.640]
In an effort to smash George W Bush's reelection hopes more to come momentarily, more to come,

[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.700]
score to break.

[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.380]
We got a lot of good, the pile of good stuff here today.

[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:00.740]
Good.

[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.300]
Mad Dog at two, the Humper at four.

[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.700]
Now the Humper said, I've had an answer.

[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.600]
Hurricane warm up at seven.

[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.860]
Oh, clearance and definitely going to make your life so miserable the next three years you won't know what hit you.

[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.280]
Hurricane warm up at seven.

[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.440]
I think you got the, oh, no, that was, is that, I thought that was last night.

[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.580]
What we plan to promo for that all day yesterday, today is Tuesday last time I checked, right?

[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:24.960]
Yeah.

[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.880]
Maryland Baltimore County, which sounds like a little girls team at the Hurricanes basketball.

[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.080]
I guess that's tonight's 7 30.

[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.940]
Any K follows that was good luck to him and Joe and Mark overnight.

Not, in other words, not the University of Maryland, but Maryland Baltimore County, juvenile detention center team against the Hurricanes.

[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:43.380]
Right.

[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.460]
I think you got the right to go to the U.S. State Montessori School.

[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.040]
Wow.

[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.360]

[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:03.960]
These.

[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.280]
Well, good morning.

[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:12.460]
This is former VOTS president and former president Blanchard, Canada, Al Gore.

[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.340]
I'm here to quash the rumors. I am alive.

[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.520]
I used to be the man who was in control.

[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.640]
I used to be the man who was on a roll.

[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:32.420]
Now I just sit home in my undies and socks looking for that key to my damn lock box.

[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:39.780]
I'll dig Cheney. You think you're special? I'll dig Cheney. You think you're fuff on out?

[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:45.920]
So you're Mr. Popular VP? That down in press may much.

[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.920]
You're at least as side as I am and you're bald like me.

[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:55.200]
Now don't get me wrong, dick. I think you're all right.

[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.080]
But how many times does your heart beat at night?

[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.680]
You don't impress me much.

[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.960]
I'm trapped.

[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.320]
Here you go. Now I'll dig your box.

[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:17.920]
Who's a real big man? He should write like you notes to Afghanistan.

[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:24.500]
There's only two types of banks from Texas. His dance band, Cardrodden.

[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:33.360]
He's a little Joe. Oh, George Bush. You think you're special? Oh, George Bush. You think you're fuff on out?

[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:39.480]
So you're Mr. Popular President, who? That down in press may much.

[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.200]
But I want to be hurtful. I can be so your ears are bigger than rocks.

[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.960]
Pro. Now don't get me wrong, George. I think you're all right.

[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.720]
But how many beers do your girls drink at night?

[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.380]
You don't impress me much.

[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.000]
Don't let them ever think real President. A real man.

[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:11.260]
And what about me? Well, look at me. I am a killer of perfection.

[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.460]
But all I must is miss a tad of a fleshy fad.

[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:22.280]
Maybe I should hit the gym. No, I'm beautiful.

[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:27.620]
1034, I'd say he looked a little bit better. He had that hair down over the side of his head, kind of like Hitler this morning.

[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.440]
You know what I said? Right.

[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.560]
Shake that beard. Right. All he needs to get that little mustache back.

[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.660]
Because that seems to be in with a lot of America today.

[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:39.220]
Could I ask Arthur, please, to stop faxing this picture that won't come through no matter how many people I've been.

[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.400]
Oh, and also, I mean, that's why I can't get my fax to you.

[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.420]
Because I just created a second, a new second pool for today. Well, Schmidt can't get it when we leave it for tomorrow.

[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.420]
First of all, it takes an hour to print out and then it's distorted and blurry.

[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:53.820]
Yeah, Arthur, quick, the patching around with you. I'm trying to, well, here you can write it down. You can say Eric.

[00:25:54.620 --> 00:26:00.840]
Sorry, Eric. I hate to do this to you. I really don't. In fact, tomorrow, Eric, I'm going to send you 600 bedtime stories just to keep you out of the kitchen.

[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.660]
Don't you think I'm doing him a public service when I sent him a whole bunch of stuff?

[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.560]
Only if the fax machine was in another room.

[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.160]
Oh, in other words, you think it's probably in the kitchen.

[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.360]
A whole opportunity for a little later on because this first one, well, we'll see what gets in my cities.

[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.580]
All the way when you see Miami's got 28 votes throughout one program at 11. I mean, I guess that figures.

[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.280]
I mean, most of the people spend most of their time right there, right?

[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:30.080]
And they go to a win-more and cemetery village in places like that. Oh, my God. What beautiful 90-year-old people.

[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.520]
I'm sure they're thinking about South Beach and whatnot. South Beach and Fort Lauderdale Beach.

[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:41.040]
Right. And Wilton Manorath, what's your take on Al Gore's? I seriously, I have never been in anywhere.

[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:46.200]
Other than Montreal, that's the worst. But I've never been anywhere where when you're like in a highway,

[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.980]
you're on Ina 5, the turnpike, whatever, 595. And you look around, you know, you're observing the traffic.

[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.740]
And of course, you're hoping you might see somebody pretty hot. And you never do.

[00:26:55.180 --> 00:27:00.840]
I mean, maybe you just don't. You always wonder, where did the spaceship land?

[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.160]
What banana boat did they just hop off of? What old folks home do they escape from? You know what I mean?

[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:11.980]
Very seldom. Did you see anybody? I don't know. And that kind of Abercrombie and Fitch look.

[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.980]
You know what I'm talking about? I do. But I can walk outside here, for example,

[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:23.020]
and within like a one block walk, a holy crap, whatever you want, man. It's there. Abercrombie and bitch.

[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.000]
But in South Florida, I think in fact, that's why I've been so successful for many, many years.

[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:34.840]
About 30, man. 30 knows because I'm so ugly and people can relate to me. Fat, ugly, balding, fag, old.

[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:40.340]
Right? They can relate to that aging rapidly. But with the second point, you're going to write this down.

[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.260]
Yeah, well, I can try to fax it to you again, but I don't know if there's something F up with your fax machine.

[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:51.800]
Probably Arthur's father's. You're an idiot, Arthur. What's your take on Al Gore's endorsement of Howard Dean?

[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.540]
Here's my five choices. It will help Dean a lot. Are you writing this down? Yeah.

[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.220]
Should I pause? Whatever.

[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:05.480]
It makes, should I read like one word at a time, that'll kill some good time. It is a holiday, you know.

[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:10.700]
It makes no difference. It'll actually hurt Dean.

[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.680]
Well, I'm sure some people would agree with that. Although it's kind of a stupid choice, but some people will vote for that.

[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:23.300]
By the way, Julie Romain ate two happy. His running mate, this blindsided old Julie Romain, which I'm glad to see that, because that man, he makes me.

[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.920]
I would vote 100 times for Al Sharpton before I'd even think about voting for Julie Romain. How do you like that?

[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.100]
Right? Right. And Al got 200 grand in court the other day, so maybe he'd loan us a few bucks.

[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:41.600]
But I vote for anybody before I vote for Julie Romain. Not Bush. I would just believe the country. Are I already have?

[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:51.280]
If Guarantees denomination for Dean, that's your fourth choice. And last but not least, of course, I don't care I'm for Bush, which we will trace those votes.

[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:56.600]
It'll come to your house and the lock and tie you up on election day. Of course, they won't need your vote anyway. It'll be fixed.

[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.420]
This could be next year. This could be the last election ever in the US. That's my prediction.

[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:07.020]
I thought that in fact, if we have it, if we have it, right? If we have it, read that again just to make sure proof.

[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.980]
What's your take on Al Gore's endorsement? Well, this is for a little later on like Noonish.

[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.720]
What's your take on Al Gore's endorsement of Howard Dean? It will help Dean a lot. Got it?

[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:21.920]
Yep. It makes no difference. It'll actually hurt Dean. Got it?

[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:30.840]
If Guarantees denomination for Dean or I don't care, I'm for Bush. Got that? Got it.

[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:37.920]
A group of women in Southeast Michigan say they'll use pictures of scantily clad babes in an effort to smash George W. Bush's reelection hopes.

[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:43.560]
Babes against Bush as the group calls itself plans to use pin up girls as the medium for its anti-bush message.

[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:49.980]
All right. Babes against Bush has created a liberal-leaning campaign to promote political awareness to the most unlikely of audiences,

[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:56.120]
men whose cultural tastes tend towards centerfolds and the swimsuit issue of sports magazines the group said to press release.

[00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:00.940]
In other words, the sports nerds who listen to QM, they're the other 20 hours of the day. Those folks.

[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:09.280]
We figured that this was a good fun way to make people aware of the damage George Bush is doing in America said Babes against Bush model, Eleanor of Vast binder.

[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:15.020]
Guys like hot girls, so maybe they would mind getting the message from us. They'd like to get something from you, honey.

[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.680]
Or maybe I'm reading that wrong, getting the massage from us.

[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:29.320]
The group is offering what it calls a regime change countdown calendar which ticks off the days until a long duration day 2005 when a group hopes Bush will be displaced by an actual elected president.

[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.000]
Oh, I like that. That'll be novel.

[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:42.180]
They're ticking it off. The last election ticked everybody off except the Bush lookers. The calendar features 13 photos of provocatively dressed or undressed models,

[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:50.220]
but it's also a chronology of the Bush administration's misdeeds, mistakes and manglings of the truth the group said. In other words, bald faced lies.

[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:59.700]
What better ways there to get guys to notice that the president is a bozo commented January, babe, Vast binder. Pictures of the girls will get the retention they look long enough to read the fine print.

[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:05.560]
Oh, yeah, they'll be looking at this, but especially if they put the fine print in the right place, kind of like in the bush.

[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:12.000]
You don't have to be beautiful to hate George W. Bush, the group's website says, and I can certainly vouch for that. You know what I mean?

[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.800]
Yeah, right. Because there are few who hate it more than I do. Let's have a contest.

[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.080]
Okay. What's the criteria? Athens, Greece, okay?

[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:32.960]
The case is Jim, whose faxes continue to just amazing as town. I think Jim is trying to make the Guinness book of records for the most consecutive faxes with the shortest number of words.

[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.340]
In fact, you could have just written Athens, Jim. We know where Athens is.

[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:45.180]
Is that Athens, not Athens, Georgia? Oh, that's right. Athens, Georgia. That's where the Virgin Mary keeps popping up. Damn it. There she is again.

[00:31:45.980 --> 00:32:00.360]
Let's see. What do them, what does that say in regards to two by each in Noah's Ark? What if one of them animals were past past, or this is past breeding age tool to get pregnant?

[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:10.700]
Oh, bad mistake Noah. In fact, maybe that's why I hope a lot of the animals from those days, those prehistoric times, I mean, pre-sensible times. Maybe that's why we don't have no mo. You think?

[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.400]
That's right. The dinosaurs wouldn't fit. Remember they said that.

[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:23.740]
They don't get sore about it. In fact, remember, see the USA in your Chevrolet? You make dinosaurs every time they brought that up, especially when they talked about Bert Reynolds' wig?

[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:29.820]
And the fact that he might be a fact. Now, we don't believe that Bert. How's Bert and Jacks doing? Anybody seen him lately? No.

[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:44.740]
Oh, we're supposed to ego eat and free these days. Boy, once Bert and Jacks, so when on their day must have been really a bad day in his life. To which we say, all right. 1041 at 560 WQM every day is a good day over at Brandes because it's going strong with their 25th anniversary this year.

[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:53.600]
25 long excruciating years of taking care of your smelly feet. That's right, whether you have beautiful lovely feet like me, or maybe kind of like mangled cancels.

[00:32:54.580 --> 00:33:10.980]
They don't care. Even Hillary get a good fit over there because they have the top names. They got the best prices and they got a personalized sales staff who really know their crapping of your friendly service to make sure you get a perfect fit every time at Brandes. You'll find the top names rock ports, echoes, Mephisto, Timberlain, Clarks, SAS, Floreshawn. You want to take got it.

[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:31.060]
No matter how big or small your feet may be, how large or petite they can fit you because they got men size 6 to 15, women's 5 to 12 and went from the very, very narrow to the very gigantic big fat and wide. Brandes shoes you'll find about 12, 90 North Federal Highway in Poppano Beach, the open Monday through Saturday, 9 to 9 every Sunday, 10 to 5. And all this week at Brandes, men's rock ports.

[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.980]
I'm gagging on it.

[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:52.420]
What a m'haya. All this week at Brandes, men's rock port pro walkers are only 48, 90. You can also save up to 57% of the select rock port styles. I'm gagging on it. Just a little flim. Stop and or visit them on the away. But Brandes shoes.

[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.200]
With two S's Brandes shoes dot com. It's time to bring some flowers for me.

[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:13.620]
Did the sealants get right to the things that didn't the most talk about of recent data and that's crisis you have had a financial problem?

[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:20.240]
You know, Larry, I'm not making so much money these days. We are told that you have you're part of the financial problem.

[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:38.660]
Oh, definitely. Yes. And I think that well, I sort of have an inside track. You know what I mean? That's why the distortion of the truth somewhere in the vicinity of $700 billion. Did you know it was that much? No, I've been 700 billion. Yes. You're kidding.

[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:50.380]
Timing is everything. You know what they say? Yeah, bitch. Shame on you. Mod the Stuart fraud. That's true. She's falling apart. bankruptcy actually on this edition of Larry King live. Don't go away.

[00:34:50.860 --> 00:35:03.000]
Uh huh. 1046 at 560 WQM. So anyway, Leon France. We're going to put that one under LYO in. Sure. What is this? Thanks. You says beautiful people are glomerate in the south of France. They are glomerate.

[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:08.180]
If you need a city, I will nominate Leon or to lose to loose live. But we're not going to put to loose.

[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:19.960]
PSI never take I take the one I take the never in church. Oh, such an extreme that I wanted to in church weddings. I do the receptionist's last wedding party afterward, but I ain't no hypocrite. Well, that's good because then you can get to free food. Right.

[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:31.480]
But you don't have to go in here. Go through that whole silly, stupid ass thing. A lot of us also enjoy that policy. Right. It's kind of like one of the parties. You know, Christmas party ratings parties. But anyway, I think it's my religion to go into other churches.

[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:37.380]
So CNN has beat us to the punch, which I figured they would, but I checked on it and they did. Nice going CNN's about time you did something right.

[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:46.120]
How they already got their pull ago and will take cars at noon. How well Al Gore's endorsement effect, Howard Deans campaigns. You know, they don't have a whole bunch of good choices like we do.

[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:52.400]
It's like everything is like either black or white. Everything's like Al Sharpton or West Clark, black or white.

[00:35:53.400 --> 00:36:05.880]
Help it. 54,441 votes. 62% hindered 38, 33,881 out of 88,322 votes. That's almost as many as we get.

[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:12.400]
62 to 38% say that Gore's endorsement will help Howard Deans.

[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:19.740]
I think what they're really trying to say is what's not to like. Right. Right. And then go away to put it. What's not to like?

[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:29.060]
Here's something not to like. A suicide bomber blew up a car packed with explosives at the gates of military barrister today, entering 41 American troops and six Iraqi civilians.

[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:35.640]
Hours earlier, three soldiers died in a road accident in Central Iraq and three civilians died when a Baghdad mosque was rocked.

[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:45.300]
The attack at the Army base occurred at 4.45 a.m. local time on a card road to the gate of the base in the town of Tallahfar, 30 miles west of the northern city of Mosul.

[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:50.100]
Guards at the gate and in a watchtower, watchtower, open fire on a vehicle and moments later blew it up.

[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:57.900]
The bomb left a large crater with the gates entryway and a insanity continues madness. 5.67.

[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:02.200]
We got to get some more cities on this pool, baby. In what city in the world, you find the best looking people.

[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:07.480]
So far we got Miami 56, Prague 15, Toronto 14, a.

[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.200]
Colone 13. Colone. See, I told you about. Colone. Didn't I? Ha ha ha.

[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:21.440]
Well, I said people out there that have been around. That's good. Good to see. You're right. Spoke hands six, Boston five Salt Lake City five Athens one and Leo and just went on there.

[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:32.080]
Out of 115 vote. I'm sure we got some other choices. WQ I am like that one WQ I am out of touch liberal. Yeah. Yeah. WQ I am out of touch liberal.

[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:40.780]
I know that I know this relax. Relax. He wanted to say it again. The second time practice makes perfect.

[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:52.340]
Would you like to just get a slap like a two by four and just beat him silly? I mean, just five six seven O five 60 pound five 60. Yeah, touch this asshole. WQ I am.

[00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:05.480]
Oh, WQ I am. Rome is a perfect choice and he doesn't mean Rome Georgia or Rome New York either. Absolutely not.

[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:12.520]
Baby. I mean, I've even hurt you. Rome Italy, baby. Man, now you'll see a lot of people with a big hook.

[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:21.700]
No, there's two. I mean, there are many different kinds of Italian looks. You know what I mean? Correct. Many different kinds of Italian looks and some include a hook look right a big hook nose.

[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.620]
Some would my confused for Jewish like Brian and life of Brian who found out he was a Roman after all. He had the Roman nose.

[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:37.260]
A he a red sea pedestrian. A red sea pedestrian. One of my favorite lines in that movie. I'm a red sea pedestrian.

[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:51.480]
That's what you're leaving. It's trying to say. It was okay. Big deal. Go walk here. Go get a try. Yeah, go walk across it right now. I mean, there they see if a girl would have wise up about Lieberman four years, three years ago, we wouldn't be in this mess right now.

[00:38:52.020 --> 00:39:01.520]
We wouldn't have the bush. Meister. We wouldn't be up to our ears in this quagmire in Iraq. Isn't it interesting? How is everybody in their brother now is calling it quagmire after I've been doing that for like how many months and call me.

[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:07.580]
These fascist Nazis which have been doing for years. Isn't that amazing if you wait long enough? They'll catch up to old. That's right.

[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.860]
Here's our favorite line. It's always a winner. Line nine Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:23.360]
Wishful thinking man. Back to men over Dave. There's a long line. He'd like to give you a little best holiday wishes. W.A.M.

Thank you. That's what I hear. Thanks a lot, Pamela and everybody. Okay. You go boy. Sydney, Australia is just too far to get there.

[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:47.260]
Man, everybody talks about how great it is down under. But it's just so damn far from anywhere. It's like a why it's the same thing unless you live on a west coast. Right.

[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:53.740]
It's the other side of the world unless you live on the left coast as the assholes like to say it is. I mean the way down under there.

[00:39:53.980 --> 00:40:00.160]
Still a lot of fags there in Sydney. So I hear in fact, remember that show love Sydney with Tony Randall? Nope.

[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:10.800]
And what was what was the other show he was on where he played the Queen. Jack Klugman. No, not with Jack Klugman. That was the odd couple. What was the other show? Was that love Sydney? I'm a B.C. Yeah.

[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:19.040]
Where he played Uncle Sydney who happened to be gay. It was not about how many minutes was that on the T-Cockster like molting.

[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:29.520]
We better get rid of that. Tony Randall by the way just turned 95. His wife is pregnant again. Right. WQ I am. WQM. Hello.

[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:13.480]
Good morning. Morning to you, sir. I wish you happy holidays. Yes. I also want to say Athens, Greece got the most beautiful people. Yeah. If only somebody would loan them some deodorant or a bar of soap would be good.

[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:37.220]
I have a great holiday. Yeah. Well, I'm trying to say is that I've never been there and I'm never going to go there. Now everybody tells me that meek and os is great. You know, those islands off of Greece. See. Everybody says, oh, phenomenal. Fantastic. But Athens itself. I hear is one of the dirtiest, filthiest cities in the world. And the people there just the women have got more here than the other.

[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:47.220]
They have a little boy head on his head today and the women and the men just every time they grab that soap, they drop it because they like to win it the Greek way. How's that? So they never get to bathe with it. They like.

[00:41:47.520 --> 00:42:04.880]
I see olive oil. I'll take their word for it. I'm not going. Let's see. Madhouse vacancies. What is this? Scott for well. Oh, look at this. All right. Here's some Scott for well news. This is excellent. Thank you so much. Whoever sent this to us.

[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:36.500]
After nine years, this traffic reported joined WZN FM. So there's some radio news. Therefore here from Chicago. Good luck to you, Scott. I really think he just needs to get out of South Florida immediately.

[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:48.240]
Not sooner in the fine place. You know, yeah, who shouldn't right? Right. And especially get away from his good post personal friend. I don't want to mention no name. Absolutely. That one. The backstab.

[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:56.860]
The OJs when they did that song speaking of OJ, the OJs, the song to backstab. They had to mow in mind. Absolutely. That's what they were thinking about. The song was all about him.

[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:11.660]
By the way, don't forget 60th birthday today for Jim Morrison. We'll get to that. Rayman, zero will speak. Not. What an asshole. Speaking of great. The recording artist Ozzy Osborne badly injured and crashed bad news.

[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:22.780]
British rocker Ozzy Osborne fractured eight ribs and a vertebra in his neck in a bite crash on his English country estate. But doctors said today he's comfortable and stable in hospital.

[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:30.280]
I'll show up the way the Brits and the Canadians do that too. They never say in the hospital comfortable and stable in hospital. I don't know why they do that.

[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:41.640]
What are the most famous for biting off the head of a bad motive is wildest age concerts would wasn't what they said it was. Underwent emergency surgery at the Wetson Park Hospital in southern England overnight after the crash and an altering bite.

[00:43:41.640 --> 00:44:08.320]
And his estate in Buckingham, sure. We're sure. Are you sure? Mr. Ozzy Osborne was brought in yesterday following an accident at home. Consultant Dick Jack told reporters outside the hospital early today. That's his name. Consultant spotted Dick Jack. He had a fractured left collarbone. He had some damage to the blood vessel lies underneath the collarbone. He had eight fractured ribs on the left side. Addison of that. He has a small and terribly stable fracture of one of the vertebra in his neck.

[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:16.720]
The 55 year old heavy metal rocker was injured by riding a quad bike during a day off from promoting his new single. The duet with his daughter Kelly entitled changes.

[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:25.660]
Ozzy Born in Birmingham, central England. The first shot to fame in 1970s. He's leading singer of the groundbreaking heavy metal band Black Sabbath. His viciously angry lyrics.

[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:36.080]
Bruce M. Stunson, disturbing images of evil earned the band cult status. Yadi, yadi, yadi. He made of course we have another Ozzy article later about the fact that he was stoned off his ass when he did the whole series and all these interviews, etc.

[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:53.800]
He's got a little problem. You know what I mean? Like Rush. The difference being we hate Rush and we like Ozzy Osborne a lot. Right. So there's the difference. He saws his honest about it. Right. 10.56 at 5.60. It doesn't pretend to be a goody. Two shoes and doesn't tell everybody that he's holier than now. Point fingers. And locked it up to not like that.

[00:44:53.800 --> 00:45:05.800]
Say he just did he generate slob and he admits it. 10.57 at QA. It's the most wonderful time of the year. I can't every time I see that line in his copy. I want to start singing like Andy Williams. But I can't sing number one. Number two. Who the hell knows who that is.

Hello Sports fans, I'm Ozzy Osborne. The Prince of F**king Football. This year looks like it's gonna be exciting in the NFL.

[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:53.840]
One team to definitely watch out for are the Green Bay Packers.

[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.600]
Cut Ozzy on that's Packers.

[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.700]
What? Packers, Green Bay Packers.

[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:07.760]
Not Packers? Okay, okay. Can we start again? Can we start it over?

[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:09.300]
Can we use it?

[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:15.360]
In the AFC Central, you have to watch out for the upstock Cleveland Browns.

[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.760]
Browns? What the f**k is a Brown?

[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:20.140]
Cut!

[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:27.020]
How about those New England guys? The f**king Patriots or something like that?

[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:31.680]
That reminds me of when I was growing up in England, right in Birmingham. We were poor family.

[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:34.500]
Ozzy Osborne, take the script if you can please.

[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.500]
F**king you on the Prince of F**king Football.

[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.960]
Cut! Cut! Shen!

[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:49.920]
In the AFC, you have to like the Falcons, the Bears, the Panthers and Lions. Jesus Christ, I feel like I'm...

[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:57.760]
In line with the f**king Sue, where all these f**king Falcons and Panthers and s**t, is this football or mutual of Omaha's wild f**king kingdom?

[00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:58.720]
Cut it!

[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:02.980]
That's all that's on the Q-Cut, man. What do you want me to do about it?

[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.320]
That just rippin' up, I'll see.

[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:09.580]
Let's all put this week on Ozzy Osborne. The Bricks of F**king Football.

[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:14.620]
Let's go. 3 at 5.60 W. Here I'm there, you're showing on CNN, the US helicopter made a hard landing.

[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.700]
There was an accident near Fallujah, but nobody got hurt.

[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.800]
Seriously, it was an accident but nobody got hurt.

[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:24.880]
Here's a fact, this is, please take the Miami Vote down. It's the resident idiot vote detraction of the true pool.

[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.920]
Monkey-jung will be a more specific choice of allowing Miami to be a choice.

[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:35.080]
Well, we have to do that as much as it pains me because we have many very perocular people and a lot of shluppers do, a lot of homeless, a lot of people on the rubber rafts.

[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.640]
We'll never get out of town, so what do they know?

[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.140]
Miami's got 74 and what city would you find the best looking people in the world?

[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:48.220]
Miami's 74, Prague 18, Cologne 15, Toronto 14, Hollywood, California. Where'd that come from, 11?

[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.520]
You sneak that in on me, but that's a good choice.

[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:51.100]
Oh, yeah, from the other side.

[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:59.540]
Well, can 7, Salt Lake City 6, Boston 6, Rome, Italy 5, Leon France. How come we got Rome Italy, but we don't have...

[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:03.840]
Okay, I don't care. Leon 3, Athens 3, and Sydney, Australia 3.

[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.120]
Suicide blast near Moscow Hotel kills 5.

[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:21.060]
Oi! Just the only moment to go. A suicide bomber blew herself up outside the national hotel across from Moscow's red square today killing 5 by standards, winning at least 12 and sparking fears of a new wave of terror attacks in the heart of the Russian capital.

[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:26.340]
Politicians said they stayed Dumas or lower house of problem might have been the intended target, not the hotel.

[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.340]
Well, sometimes they got bad aim like the US, you know, like...

[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:30.560]
Oops.

[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:32.700]
Yeah. Chinese embassy.

[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:38.840]
The attack came shortly before President Vladimir Putin addressed a meeting nearby at the Kremlin in two days after Russian parliamentary elections.

[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.940]
Moscow mayor Lutskov said that there was at least one possibly two female bombers.

[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.820]
They appeared to be lost before the blast-asseting direction.

[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:47.140]
So they stayed Dumas.

[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.000]
Oh, he had a lost suicide bombers. That's the worst.

[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:51.040]
Man.

[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.880]
And more startling news.

[00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:03.120]
The blood found in the car of the man charged with kidnapping Jew Shodans matches the Missing College students DNA source said today.

[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.680]
I say let's kill him on TV.

[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:06.660]
Okay.

[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:12.380]
Or let's just hang him up by his balls run on TV until he tells us where she is and then we'll kill him.

[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:12.900]
Okay.

[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:22.080]
The preliminary match confirmed by a law enforcement source who's spec of course on a condition of anonymity would be the most significant yet in authorities attempts to convicted sex offender Alfonso.

[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.480]
Rod Riga is junior at the University of North Dakota student disappearance.

[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.440]
Never trust anybody named Rod Riga.

[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:27.940]
Look at that.

[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:37.460]
When he sent Pudgepack and always be aware of anybody named Rod Riga is see the source also confirmed reports that a knife found in Rod Riga is trapped.

[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:43.480]
Max and I've she found your Shodans car in a parking lot of the Grand Forge shopping mall where she vanished November 22.

[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:49.500]
He's been charged with her kidnapping is Moon 4 or 2002 Mercury Sable was in punitive.

[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:53.100]
This is story have all the background in this because we've had it.

[00:50:53.620 --> 00:51:00.980]
The fact that they let this son of a bitch out that's what we he's a convicted rapist with a history of attempted kidnapping with adult women as youth.

[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:09.080]
The weapon and at least one assault he was registered as a predatory offender the classification of those believed to be at the highest risk of committing another sex crime and he did not disappoint.

[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:15.120]
He was released from a Minnesota prison in May after serving 23 years for an attempted induction 1979.

[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:21.520]
Wayne Swanson who prosecuted Rod Riga said he tried to abduct a woman off the street and stabbed her when she fought back.

[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:22.900]
So there you go.

[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:28.100]
I mean 23 years maybe 230 years might be okay but 23 years obviously wasn't enough.

[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.320]
Damn it.

[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:35.280]
5 6 7 0 5 6 you let's get some more cities on this list while this pool till noon okay.

[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.260]
And then we'll get to the real me to the matter of the alcohol endorsement.

[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:41.380]
I should play that thing again like four or five times and we can go home.

[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:41.820]
Okay.

[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:42.980]
WQ I am.

[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.920]
5 10 what's going on?

[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:46.760]
How you doing sir?

[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.740]
The city with the best looking people is Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:51.740]
Rio.

[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:52.640]
Yeah.

[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:55.520]
Where the men are women and the women women are men.

[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.760]
Not well the women are exceptional.

[00:51:59.320 --> 00:51:59.640]
Okay.

[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:01.520]
We got you down pal thanks.

[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:01.880]
Alright.

[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:02.360]
Thanks.

[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.680]
I still away go Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.180]
It's a long awaited temporary.

[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.440]
I told you one time years ago I was going to go to Sao Paulo.

[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:14.300]
In fact I even had my reservation booked and I looked at the map and I realized the trip was like nine and a half hours as I said.

[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:15.120]
I don't think so.

[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.700]
That's what we got under with the penguins are.

[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.420]
Yeah well really much further from Miami it's like about nine hours.

[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.040]
It's a long long schlep man.

[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:26.160]
You can fly to like you can fly to London in the six.

[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.980]
Well that's a lot longer than that.

[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.580]
How far is the test here like 21 hours?

[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:33.580]
Somebody called once and said oh my god.

[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:36.180]
I can't imagine doing that even in business class.

[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.860]
Even the luxurious comfort of business class.

[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:41.360]
I can't imagine 21 hours is like a whole day.

[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:43.560]
You never taken like a cross country bus trip.

[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:44.320]
No.

[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:45.940]
Oh thank you.

[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:46.920]
I've done it seven times.

[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:53.760]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon world's line.

[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:54.660]
And speaking of that.

[00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:56.580]
Not that I want to bring up bad news.

[00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:02.560]
But whatever happened remember that the series of greyhound bus hijackings that took place there.

[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:05.480]
What by random crazy people like two or three.

[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:06.400]
Yeah.

[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:06.920]
Yeah.

[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.220]
Don't you remember that was right around the history of the.

[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:11.760]
They tried to tie it.

[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:12.420]
They couldn't.

[00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:12.600]
They couldn't.

[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.380]
It was just lunatics.

[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:15.260]
They tried to tie it in.

[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.780]
They couldn't so forget about it.

[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:17.580]
I see.

[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.260]
So no, just take the bus.

[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:20.160]
Maybe the driving to us.

[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:20.540]
That's right.

[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:21.400]
Go first.

[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:22.620]
WQAM. Hello.

[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.540]
Hey, I'm just talking.

[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.400]
I want to give him the city.

[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.500]
Speaking sir.

[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.020]
This is not Neil.

[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:30.240]
Is sure his hell is.

[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.460]
Oh, Neil, good morning.

[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:31.980]
How are you doing?

[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:32.680]
I'm doing great.

[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:33.240]
How are you doing?

[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:33.920]
Okay.

[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:35.620]
Cape Town South Africa.

[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:36.760]
I'm going to give out a town.

[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.020]
Cape Town South Africa.

[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:38.960]
Yes.

[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:39.940]
Okay.

[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:40.700]
Yeah.

[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.920]
Very beautiful woman.

[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:43.760]
Blondon, blue eyes.

[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:45.720]
That German blood.

[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:46.800]
What can I tell you?

[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.380]
Probably kidnapped him from Sweden.

[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:48.820]
No doubt.

[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:49.380]
Thanks a lot.

[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:50.140]
Okay.

[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:51.120]
You take out the date.

[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.880]
Cape Town South Africa.

[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:53.980]
Unlikely source.

[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.340]
But there's a few white boats.

[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:55.660]
They're the most white boats down there.

[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.220]
In fact, they're mostly white folks in South Africa.

[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.120]
They showed all their darkies up into the jungles.

[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.640]
Depending on which hood you're in.

[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:02.220]
Right.

[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.280]
Well, that's really sad.

[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.100]
What's going on over there?

[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.220]
And of course, they're world blivious.

[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.360]
You just listen to the Pope and George W.

[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:07.620]
Man.

[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:10.060]
Don't talk about birth control in any of their classes.

[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.640]
Otherwise, we're going to take away your AIDS funding.

[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.360]
And certainly don't be using no condoms.

[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:15.160]
Otherwise, the Pope's going to make sure you're burning hell.

[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.740]
And they put in a bad word for you.

[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:19.980]
So it's kind of like a catch-22 is what they got.

[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.500]
And they're catching a lot of bad things.

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.860]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.680]
It's just so sad, man.

[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:26.720]
It is so sad.

[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.660]
When you start listening to the religious nuts.

[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:31.080]
When they see the people in power, like they are in Nevada,

[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:34.280]
and in the US, in Washington, and in so many other places in the world,

[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.760]
then you have to go, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:36.800]
What the hell chance have we got?

[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:39.700]
Because, like I told you yesterday in a million other times,

[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:41.660]
that's what the battle on the face of the earth is.

[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:44.440]
The intelligent, rational, even forget about intelligent,

[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:47.960]
the rational, the anti-religious crowd, who realized that, you know,

[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:49.340]
we got to take care of Venice here.

[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.100]
And then the superstitious, hawkist, pokest crowd.

[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:53.980]
Oh, the Lord works in mysterious ways.

[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:55.680]
And Armageddon's coming and blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:56.420]
And all this other crap.

[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:01.500]
Man, then people, they need to be locked up right along with that Rodriguez guy.

[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:03.940]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:04.960]
Congoleneal.

[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:05.760]
Yes, sir.

[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.780]
Oh, hey, I actually, I didn't call into chime in on your call,

[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:11.400]
but I would have to say that it's probably got to be Rio.

[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:16.060]
Or somewhere in Brazil, because the Brazilian women there in Miami are just gorgeous.

[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:17.120]
I'll be damned.

[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:21.760]
Actually, I was calling to say, you know, I'm real worried about the elections coming up

[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.860]
with the die-bold and the electronic voting.

[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:28.080]
I mean, does everybody see that that is just like the wolf guarding the henhouse?

[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:31.340]
I can't believe that, you know, after the debacle of 2000,

[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:36.060]
that the country buys, oh, the weight of fix it is with a paperless, you know,

[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:39.700]
totally system that you can't track.

[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:40.560]
No paper, right.

[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.120]
Well, we had a story on a couple of days ago about the fact that the,

[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.600]
and I think it was Neil and Oye that they're testing the one,

[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:50.400]
right, is the paper trail with it so that they wouldn't have any of these machines

[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.860]
that just strictly have to take their word on account.

[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:53.960]
There's no way to trace it.

[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.020]
But also, I had read, I think maybe on the article on your website,

[00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:00.860]
that some of them, they can like anyone with a basic computer understanding

[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:02.600]
can get in there and hack with them.

[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:06.100]
And even if they do print out something that says, hey, you voted for Gore,

[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.580]
how do we know that it didn't register Bush?

[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.800]
And that's what I don't want to be, one way to be safe,

[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.440]
and that is hop on a plane, man.

[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:17.240]
Can we, I want to really start a protest or something like,

[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:20.380]
when I go to vote in November, I want to say, hey, I don't trust you.

[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:22.880]
It's machines. I want my vote on pallet.

[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:26.000]
Let's count them by hand, then we can go through that same thing we did back in 2000,

[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.840]
at least it killed some good time anyway.

[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:31.260]
I'm afraid though, if we protested, what happened to the protestors there

[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:32.700]
in downtown Miami will happen, no?

[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:33.500]
Yeah.

[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.220]
America is lost, Uncle Neil.

[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:41.040]
So in fact, when you'll know on January 1st, when they replaced the American flag with

[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.580]
Eswastika, then you'll know it's official.

[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:43.460]
Love you, Neil.

[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:44.640]
See you at the border, Pali.

[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:45.700]
Bye-bye.

[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:46.920]
Good luck to us.

[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.400]
Hey, speaking of, imagine this.

[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:54.100]
Imagine Todd Dreck lying in your backyard, like looking like a pus, a pus jewel.

[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:59.080]
With blood and pus oozing from every pornist's body, can you imagine that?

[00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:00.340]
I love it.

[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.240]
Imagine this. Imagine zero closing costs on your next mortgage.

[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:05.040]
Zero application fee.

[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:06.680]
Zero credit bureau fee.

[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.360]
Zero discounted point.

[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:10.980]
It's the last mortgage you'll ever need.

[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.940]
The revolutionary only one mortgage from financial group.

[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:17.460]
Now with interest rate of just 1.95%, you heard right.

[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:22.980]
If you have yourself a $200,000 loan, your payments are a pittance, a mere $738 a month.

[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.660]
Once you be financed, you get a new home mortgage from financial group.

[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.180]
You'll never pay close and cost again.

[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.620]
So what's not to like about that?

[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:32.500]
Call them toll free and find out all about it at 1-809-40 land.

[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:35.440]
Grab yourself real financing power with a low rate mortgage.

[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.540]
You can move your next property without any further cost or expense.

[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:41.720]
The only one mortgage from financial group is what we're talking about.

[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.880]
Call 1-809-409 for details.

[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.000]
It's a whole new way to buy.

[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.960]
You pay zero underwriting fee.

[00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.500]
Zero dock fee.

[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.200]
Zero prepayment penalty.

[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:51.640]
Zero closing cost.

[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.440]
Even when you move to another property.

[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.600]
So get yourself financing it just 1.95%.

[00:57:56.860 --> 00:58:00.480]
Call 1-809-409 to never pay close and cost again.

[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.820]
That's 1-809-40L-E-N-D.

[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:04.940]
The Renequal Housing Lender.

[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:09.620]
Restrictions apply rates up to change monthly 5.19 APR.

[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.420]
We're supporting you 5.60.

[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:15.820]
UAM.

[00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:20.940]
And the men where all the girls disrobed.

[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:25.500]
There's one thing keeps me going back the lack of their wardrobe.

[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.620]
Maybe one will come home with me.

[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.520]
Oh, that is what I hope.

[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:34.300]
Oh, I really like the one named Joy.

[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:35.680]
A stripper named Joy.

[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:40.060]
Oh, I really like some Christmas Joy.

[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:43.640]
Sorry that you stepped on the Humper there 1117 at 5.60.

[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:44.620]
They stepped on the Humper.

[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:46.380]
Yeah.

[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:48.580]
Are they getting all bent out of shape in psychotic here?

[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:50.960]
The Dow went a little above 10 grand for like about two seconds.

[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:53.260]
And now it's 99.69.

[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:54.360]
It's up 4.99.

[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.280]
Now, as that is down 60.

[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:58.800]
But again, it keeps just like I told Ted David what he called it last week.

[00:58:58.960 --> 00:58:59.580]
Same old crap.

[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.040]
Playing with the minds of the public.

[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.360]
It's the old psychological game.

[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.540]
Oh, everything is great.

[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.440]
And look at all these new jobs people are got for like five bucks an hour.

[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:09.660]
See, that's another thing they didn't tell you about the kinds of jobs that people are getting.

[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.320]
They're still almost 3 million jobs short.

[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.360]
We're talking about real jobs.

[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:14.120]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:15.460]
Yes, I know.

[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:16.640]
Real jobs.

[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.040]
Real honest to goodness jobs.

[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.260]
Not makefully phony baloney.

[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:20.460]
Part-time jobs.

[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:22.600]
Our jobs during a holiday season jobs.

[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:23.600]
All of these things.

[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:24.000]
Right.

[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:25.440]
Not trying to like peon anybody's parade.

[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:26.640]
But keep it in perspective.

[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:30.900]
Because man, oh man, are they trying to play a psych game on a public?

[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:32.220]
Okay, everything is really great.

[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:34.960]
And there's Alan Greenspan with his briefcase that old fossil.

[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:37.200]
Jesus Christ almighty.

[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.280]
I'm so sick and tired of seeing that piece of crap.

[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.220]
Here's a fact that says.

[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:44.240]
Neil, I've never been there, but Rio must have the best looking people.

[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:46.140]
Seems to be last time we took this.

[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:46.960]
We got the same result.

[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:47.680]
It wasn't that long ago.

[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:49.620]
In fact, I got to call yesterday and spread me to do this.

[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:50.520]
To you, okay?

[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:51.360]
That's okay.

[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:53.160]
I used to work in downtown.

[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:56.960]
I mean, the only thing I look forward to in the summer with the annual Brazilian invasion.

[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:59.840]
Holy Schmidt from 14 to 40, maybe 50.

[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.100]
The women were stunning.

[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:03.660]
14 to 50.

[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:04.560]
14.

[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:05.800]
The best...

[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.400]
I was...

[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:06.500]
Yeah.

[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:07.740]
You're not even what?

[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:10.180]
Nothing.

[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:11.000]
Get a respond to that.

[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:11.760]
Why?

[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.360]
That pet-o purve.

[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.100]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.440]
Well, some 14-year-old girls look 18.

[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.960]
See, better check ID.

[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.800]
The best was seeing them at the pool at the Innercontinital Hotel.

[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.380]
And I see, I don't understand this.

[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.240]
You'll have to brief me.

[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:33.040]
Especially when you had an 18 or 19-year-old and her MILF going topless together.

[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.660]
What does that mean?

[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:37.760]
Mom, I'd like to, you know...

[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.160]
Oh.

[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:44.860]
Addling topless together, which the Innercontinital used to wink at, given its European and South American clientele outstanding.

[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.360]
I never heard that before in my life.

[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.340]
See, leave it to Josh the fluorescent on that.

[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.360]
It's from the American Pie movie.

[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.580]
Oh, well, no wonder we don't know what it is.

[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:53.720]
Oh, geez, man.

[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.320]
I know.

[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.820]
That was a cute movie, but...

[01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:56.260]
Yeah, it was cute.

[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.080]
Yeah.

[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.640]
It's not the kind of movie they have memorable lines from, I don't think.

[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.640]
Now, speaking of memorable lines, here's somebody did a lot of memorable lines, and that's...

[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.020]
...or properly by his dead today.

[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.620]
60 years old today.

[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:10.580]
Nice going, Jimmy.

[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:11.180]
Wishful,

[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.480]
...dressed up,

[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.360]
...water,

[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:15.580]
...covered,

[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:17.440]
...everything in

[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.280]
...lose

[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.340]
...even with a lot of stuff.

[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:21.100]
What I hear.

[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:23.900]
Wishful,

[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.920]
...morse and former badmates.

[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.240]
I love this view too.

[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:29.620]
Hey, Jimmy,

[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.800]
I'm not exactly happy about that, but everyone.

[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.480]
Jim Morrison's former badmates,

[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:35.300]
Bruno Candles,

[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.320]
...or Rosen of Poem,

[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.680]
...at his grave in Paris yesterday.

[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:39.240]
It could be, can you light my fire singer?

[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.200]
I wonder if light my fire song is this, you think?

[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.700]
Look at it, not even on the other mic.

[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:46.140]
It's not on this one.

[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.020]
I'm not going to get to the other one.

[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:47.720]
Don't do it.

[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.860]
and cult figure on what would have been his 60th birthday yesterday.

[01:01:56.340 --> 01:02:00.000]
We're trying to evoke the spirit of Jim Robbie Krieger from her guitarist

[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.980]
with an orist who'll dozen the fans kept behind police barriers. Many have white candles

[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:05.060]
and old album covers.

[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.600]
Had the hard-living singer survived the turn,

[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:13.600]
Susty, who would have been happy laughing joking a good man,

[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.920]
the obnoxious Rayman Zerick that or his keyboard is the same.

[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:23.940]
The year is sunshine, the love that you know is time.

[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:32.860]
I mean, he was no Elvis, but he can't ever do that.

[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.440]
Do you want to know why he was no Elvis?

[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.820]
I give up. Because he's saying real music.

[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:38.140]
Oh.

[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.140]
So you don't think? Don't I know?

[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:43.580]
I mean, everyone would do Elvis bass,

[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:44.640]
especially at the holidays,

[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.280]
we'll probably have to play the Elvis today.

[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:50.460]
But, um, see how all the people named Rodriguez

[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:52.720]
they just can't take the orders, man.

[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.780]
Oh, wait till you hear this. You want to really puke your guts out?

[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.180]
Okay.

[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.360]
This will make you get down on your hands and knees

[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.320]
and do the old Barfa Ramma, the old M-I-L-F.

[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.160]
You know what that stands for?

[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:05.660]
No.

[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:07.200]
Man, I'd like to throw up.

[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:11.600]
This is from the uh, speaking of anxiously,

[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.520]
Fudge Report, maybe Ms. Fudge and Bob Kuntz are getting together.

[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:15.160]
Oh, God.

[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:19.680]
Yes, supporters of former AC Bob Kuntz wanted to go out and just get a real job

[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.300]
and stop trying to be an O-Jomper-Vocator,

[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.940]
you asshole, faggot, you idiot, you cymbalden.

[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.320]
Ms. Fudge reports last night,

[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.580]
supporters of former First Lady Hillary Rotem Clinton

[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:31.640]
will run cable TV ads urging Democrats to write in her name

[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:34.060]
during the next month's Democratic presidential primary.

[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.000]
The ads start running today,

[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.780]
time to coincide with the Democratic candidates debate on WMUR-TV,

[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:43.700]
the local ABC affiliate, that it may also be televised nationally on C-SPAN.

[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.940]
Bob Kuntz, the Florida Queen activist behind the writing campaign,

[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:51.360]
said the 32nd ads would run for three days on cable stations in Concord,

[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.520]
Manchester and Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

[01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.700]
God, does he make you want a bar for what?

[01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:58.300]
Told you.

[01:03:58.940 --> 01:03:59.060]
Yep.

[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.600]
She's not running, Kuntz.

[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:05.280]
And here we got Gore endorses Howard Dean today, but here's a, uh,

[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.100]
and again, wouldn't you think of all the people?

[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.480]
Howard Dean, who signed the Civil Union Bill in Vermont,

[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.880]
which was groundbreaking at the time, and still is.

[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:14.360]
Mm-hmm.

[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.560]
And this guy wants to write in Hillary.

[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.120]
Maybe he likes the way Hillary dresses better.

[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.680]
Maybe he appreciates her cancels more than we do.

[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:21.880]
Maybe he wants to borrow her dresses.

[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:23.540]
Yeah, maybe he likes to dress up.

[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.340]
Maybe he and Ms. Fudge are like dressing up together.

[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:26.500]
Who'd hell knows for the holidays?

[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.960]
Because, where the hell else would Ms. Fudge have gotten that,

[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.360]
except straight from the Horses ad?

[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:30.820]
Correct him.

[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:31.700]
Oh, God.

[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:34.720]
See, that's one of the things about South Florida, man.

[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:38.380]
The same tired old muddocks, they just never go away.

[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.300]
At least the need to Brian had the decency to get, uh,

[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.220]
leave town, even though it wasn't a real, but at least they got around a town.

[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:48.180]
But Bob Kuntz, the same old crap with a bumper stickers,

[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:52.140]
and we're having a meeting by the old Oak Tree down here in Kendall

[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:54.660]
to try to figure out our strategy for our next meeting.

[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:55.900]
Remember that?

[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:56.380]
Yeah.

[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.760]
And then they got pissed off at us because we, uh, stop calling, uh,

[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.340]
announcing all the goddamn meetings.

[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:04.260]
Oh, well, let's have a meeting and wave the flag and, uh,

[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.760]
and blow a horn and a whistle or blow something.

[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.040]
I got a column for you that's going to knock your socks off.

[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:10.400]
Great.

[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.320]
By Fred Grimm in today's Miami-Herald.

[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:15.380]
It's a cold day in, uh, in Rio de Janeiro.

[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:18.060]
Actually, it is cold in the real part of the,

[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.420]
isn't it, uh, winter in the summer?

[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:19.980]
Right.

[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.580]
The seasons are ass-backward.

[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.800]
Just like them in a woman.

[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.360]
They're kind of like that.

[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.060]
They're ass-backward.

[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:24.940]
Before they're hot.

[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:26.000]
You'll not ask.

[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.340]
Fred Grimm, Terry Shiveau, is sustained only by politics.

[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:33.240]
Man, this is one of the best columns that Fred Grimm has ever written.

[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:33.940]
Nice going, Fred.

[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:35.140]
Every once in a while.

[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.280]
He, uh, he's, he's pretty good.

[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:37.240]
Right?

[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:37.780]
Right.

[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.400]
He's no Mike Mayo, thank God, who writes it would come like once every two years.

[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:42.520]
Sorry, Mike.

[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.720]
Oh, my son vacation anyway.

[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:47.440]
Like I said, it's a lift of ribbon and ass.

[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.960]
He says all the political grandstanding hasn't changed the gruesome truth.

[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:53.740]
There's no hope for Terry Shiveau.

[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.700]
Her new court-appointed guardian, Adlydom,

[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:59.160]
spent a month studying her medical records and court documents.

[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.900]
He talked to nurses and doctors.

[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:04.620]
He questioned medical legal and bioethical experts and religious scholars.

[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:05.700]
He talked to family members.

[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:08.760]
He spent time nearly every day at the bedside of the depleted woman

[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.660]
to the center of Florida's right to die controversy.

[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:15.120]
He found nothing in her perpetual mindless response that offered hope.

[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:19.320]
Guardian J. Wilson reported this week that highly competent scientifically

[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:23.100]
based physicians using recognized measures and standards have deduced with a

[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:27.400]
high degree of medical certainty that Terry is in a persistent vegetative state.

[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.820]
She has no intellectual capacity, no hope of recovery, neurological test and brain scans.

[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:35.200]
Wilson noted indicate that Terry's cerebral cortex is principally

[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:40.760]
liquid, having shrunk due to the severe anorexic trauma experience 13 years ago.

[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:44.880]
On February 25, 1990, Terry suffered a heart attack, a loss of oxygen

[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.520]
to her brain caused a permanent loss of cognitive function.

[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:52.380]
After several years of failed efforts to revive his wife, her husband, Michael, surrendered to the inevitable.

[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.540]
It had taken Michael more than three years to accommodate this reality.

[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.100]
He was beginning to accept the idea of allowing Terry to die naturally,

[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.960]
rather than remaining in the non-cognitive vegetative state

[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.440]
Wilson wrote in his report to the governor.

[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:07.280]
But that decision, which the husband said, followed his wife's wishes,

[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.180]
set off a bitter feud in court fight with Terry's parents and siblings,

[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:14.380]
they have been absolutely opposed to any decision to disconnect the feeding tube.

[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.340]
The Guardian noted that during the years long struggle these chinelars

[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:22.640]
avoid the disturbing belief that they would keep Terry alive at any and all costs,

[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.900]
even if that required amputative or limbs or open-heart surgery.

[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:30.620]
As part of the hypothetical presented, chineler family members stated that even if Terry had told them

[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.820]
of her intention to have artificial nutrition withdrawn, they would not do it.

[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:38.260]
The feeding tube was finally removed in October, but the legislature urged on by the

[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:41.980]
governor and religious fundamentalists intervened, the tube was reinserted.

[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:46.260]
A guardian was appointed a representative, but Wilson's investigation offered no hope.

[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.420]
The University of South Florida professor tried to elicit some response from Terry or her

[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:53.760]
himself. He spent time with their parents who similarly tried to demonstrate awareness

[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:54.880]
and their daughter, nothing happened.

[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:59.780]
Wilson's report only mirrored the finding of so many judges who would consider this awful case for years,

[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.740]
he had discovered nothing new. Of course, the governor before leaping into this painful

[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:07.620]
familial fight easily could have read the same records, the legislators before passing such

[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:10.940]
controversial legislation could have first considered opinions of the same experts,

[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:15.140]
scientific testimony would have led them to the same sad, inscapable conclusion that

[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:19.480]
Terry Shive always beyond hope, but scientific reality didn't matter. The governor and legislators

[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:23.260]
were indulging in anti-science like medieval potentates, hauling Terry into a

[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:27.560]
political form to appease their ignorant zealots. Wilson gently suggested that the governor

[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:32.020]
in the warring factions agreed to a compromise if Terry can eat and drink or swallow on a roll

[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:35.620]
and then she'd be sustained. Otherwise the two would be disconnect and she'd be allowed to die,

[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.520]
too late I'm afraid to die with dignity. Of course, the governor won't agree. He and his

[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:43.160]
dark age allies already know that Terry Shive can't eat or drink or swallow on her own.

[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:46.840]
They know that she's beyond medical health. The only thing sustaining her depleted life

[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:50.460]
is a gruesome, intrusive, very medieval kind of politics.

[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.860]
What a great column by Fred Graham, today's Miami hero, man he deserves a pillow surprised.

[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.360]
That was good. Something. Well, not good. Right on target and Volsey to say it, the governor

[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:03.340]
and his religious fanatic is fundamentalist allies just playing politics

[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:08.360]
with this emotional situation as always. Another god damn bush.

[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:13.660]
Twenty seven past eleven. That's what Harry wanted. Just before he croaked. Harry,

[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.300]
carry another god damn bush. So that's he'd rather than tens the limit, Harry.

[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:22.420]

[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:47.260]
So in other words, they know their crap. No job is too big or too small.

[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:51.240]
The EF from a blown fuse or a blown engine from a 73 to an 04 Bentley.

[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:55.240]
EF Tyronaut of repair does it all. All jobs are meticulously double checked

and learn your business. Got it?

[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.920]

We will take decisions

[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:49.980]

[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:51.520]
times. We will give women the most laps in this room.

[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:51.520]

[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:52.240]
We give women the balls to win.

[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:52.260]

[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.940]
Let's wrap up the first poll, as we had enough....

[01:10:58.380 --> 01:10:59.980]
Well, we did this enough that long too.

[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:04.220]
He was all whipped up by Prague and a lot of other people che quien we are in.

[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.580]
Tiny grupo is the best looking people.

[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:08.660]
Miami Floyd Lloyd in 2005

[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:09.400]
Can we agree?

[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:13.260]
So here are the people meisten some people are talking in their ownom.

[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.320]
Oh, there you go. Yeah, that's a good point.

[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:16.220]
I'm proud of that.

[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:19.220]
Mindy floor to 95. Well, most people think that they're beautiful.

[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.660]
Huh? Seriously. I mean, some of the most grotesque.

[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:25.060]
It's like Rod Stewart. Do you think I'm sexy? No.

[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.660]
We think you're gross, man. Disgusting.

[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:32.460]
Prague, 22. Hollywood, California, 20.

[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.720]
Cologne, Germany, 15. Boy, you got to go to Cologne, man.

[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.360]
If you wanted to pick one city and were to go see beautiful people and maybe

[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.000]
just kind of like fall down all over them and rub up against them,

[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.980]
that's the place Cologne, Germany, 15. Rio de Janeiro, 15,

[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.880]
which would have moved up if we had more time, but we don't.

[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.400]
Toronto, 14, not too shabby, eh? Rome, Italy, nine.

[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.460]
Boston, mass, eight.

[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.700]
Spokane, 70. Boston, she debated that.

[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:56.620]
You want to know what? Well, forget about it.

[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:58.600]
Well, because there's like living and breathing people in Boston,

[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:00.500]
got all of colleges and universities. Okay.

[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:03.280]
And they got like a lot of like 20 something kind of people.

[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.140]
People like Abercrombie and Fitch people.

[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.160]
But one of these people know,

[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:09.040]
Spokane, Washington and Salt Lake City, Utah, seven of peace.

[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.860]
Never the twin shall meet. I guarantee you that.

[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.120]
Sydney, Australia, six. Athens, Greece, five. Boy,

[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.960]
they really stink though.

[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.040]
Leon France three and Cape Town South Africa none.

[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.080]
Well, that guy would have gotten around to it.

[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:22.220]
He just didn't have a chance to vote yet.

[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:24.120]
Okay, let's smit-can at first, Polaray.

[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.360]
Let's get rid of it.

[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:28.340]
Now, let's get to the important one.

[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.080]
Aren't you waiting on pins and needles on this?

[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.380]
Yeah, whatever. No.

[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:34.360]
Well, let's be a little more topical, okay?

[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.680]
Even though we got upstates by CNN,

[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:38.860]
with our 80 million viewers and their 50 million votes under God damn pool.

[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.160]
How many votes do we get every day?

[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.000]
About 30, man.

[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:42.460]
We'll take it.

[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:44.460]
We'll take it. Plus tomorrow's payday.

[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.800]
Clarence said to check his inner mail.

[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.940]
Nice going, Clarence. You're the man.

[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:48.760]
You're the man. I won't talk about that move.

[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:50.640]
Like, uh, point number two.

[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:53.000]
What's your take on Al Gore's endorsement of Howard Dean?

[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:55.800]
Here are your five choices.

[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:58.360]
This, of course, a very important scientific poll.

[01:12:58.620 --> 01:12:59.820]
I'm not, I'm not smitting you, man.

[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:01.520]
I thought Gore was pretty impressive this morning.

[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.300]
Right. Right.

[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:02.900]
Surprise, right?

[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.480]
If he could have just butched up a little bit more like that,

[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:10.000]
he had too many advisors to ask bad advice, too many handlers,

[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:13.160]
including whatever moron, pull them, put Jew Lieberman on the ticket.

[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.460]
I mean, the kiss is death.

[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:15.560]
And I'll say it again.

[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:18.660]
There is nobody this goes to show you what about your weak need.

[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:20.560]
People you have in a so-called median America.

[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:24.140]
There is nobody else on the air in print anywhere who will tell you the reason

[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.420]
that Al Gore lost wasn't just because of our alternator.

[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:27.760]
Wasn't because of the fixed votes.

[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:29.780]
Wasn't because they kept the shards from voting in Florida.

[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:33.680]
Wasn't because they had an orthodox Jew on the ballot.

[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.080]
Oh, you can say that.

[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.020]
Well, he lost just about every southern state.

[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.480]
Did he win any state in the South?

[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:39.360]
Gore?

[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:41.840]
I don't want to jump right to it, but I don't know.

[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:43.080]
He, um, Florida.

[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:44.000]
Yeah.

[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:45.800]
Oh, we know that.

[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:49.420]
But outside of Florida, then he wouldn't lose yet.

[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.900]
I don't even know if he won any state in the South to be freaking honest.

[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.120]
Where are you going to get here?

[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:54.940]
Let me do a search.

[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:56.240]
2000.

[01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.220]
Election reads results.

[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:00.440]
Shouldn't I do it?

[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:01.700]
Okay.

[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:02.180]
At auto.

[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.060]
I should put presidential, but I don't have time to type all of that.

[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:06.960]
2000 election results.

[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.640]
Because what I like to do is get that map.

[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:10.380]
Ah, geez.

[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:14.020]
Oh, yeah.

[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.220]
The 2000 election.

[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:15.700]
Here we go.

[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:16.760]
Look at that.

[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:17.280]
There it is.

[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.860]
Why does it come up with these colors every now?

[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:20.860]
And I want to do the web search.

[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.800]
I don't like the pink and the blue.

[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:23.520]
Have you ever seen that?

[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:23.880]
Because it knows.

[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.300]
No, no pink on my computer.

[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:25.860]
Faggot.

[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:30.620]
US presidential election that says, oh, it's under fixed elections.

[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.660]
Uh, Bush versus Gore.

[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:37.640]
Oh, these are a whole bunch of pseudo electoral articles about that.

[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:38.440]
I don't want that.

[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.360]
Uh, election results.

[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:43.200]
Should I put electoral votes?

[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:45.580]
Okay, electric, electrical bloats.

[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.800]
2000 election.

[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:48.620]
Electoral.

[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:52.360]
Votes, which again is of course a stupid thing.

[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.260]
If we didn't gotten rid of the electoral college a long time ago,

[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:56.620]
we wouldn't have the Bush,

[01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:58.060]
my sister in there now with all this crap.

[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.580]
And we wouldn't be sacrificing the lives of all these American kids

[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:03.500]
in an crazy and patient war in legal war in Iraq.

[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:05.360]
Okay, let's see.

[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.200]
Electro votes.

[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.520]
Distribution of votes.

[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:09.540]
270.

[01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:11.320]
Uh, now this isn't going to tell me.

[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:12.980]
Oh, yeah, man.

[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.120]
This ain't going to tell me crab.

[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.980]
I don't want the distribution of electoral votes.

[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:17.820]
I wonder who won.

[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.080]
Would you look it up?

[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:19.700]
I will.

[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:19.780]

[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:20.060]
I will.

[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.420]
Because you're just, you're incompetent.

[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:24.940]
Well, no, I mean, when it comes to finding stuff on this,

[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.920]
you're just not, uh, I mean, I'll just get about it.

[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.660]
Like what it comes to finding a tinny bar.

[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:30.360]
You pronounce that in one time.

[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.480]
Uh, one time.

[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:31.620]
One time.

[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:32.820]
Why am I saying I put yesterday?

[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:33.800]
What's that?

[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:35.560]
What was that perverted website?

[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:36.600]
I turned you on to yesterday.

[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:39.160]
I don't know, lactating breasts.com.

[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.860]
It was lactating Hispanic breast.com.

[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.600]
Something like that.

[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.280]
You can write a name on occasion that I tried to find something on the internet.

[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:46.740]
Well, you know, we're relaxed.

[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:47.720]
I'm just kidding.

[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.040]
I just calm down.

[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:52.260]
Man, oh man.

[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:55.900]
Just because your name is Rodriguez and everybody hates Rodriguez's these days,

[01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:57.600]
because you got that rapist ax murder.

[01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:00.660]
And then you got the Pudge Meister who got that they sent Pudge back and

[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.160]
Beeners and Reekens, the lot of them.

[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:04.060]
And by the way, let me tell you, who the hell wrote that column?

[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:05.060]
Was it Dave Hyde, man?

[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:08.220]
Dave on the one hand Fred Grimmon, a hero writes a great column today.

[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.580]
You write the most weak need.

[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.180]
Oh, what a pussy you are, Dave.

[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.380]
Dave, you ought to hide.

[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:14.840]
Mr. Jica and Mr. Hyde.

[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.640]
God, if the scum's sent, what a weak need column.

[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.220]
He's got about Pudge Rodriguez today.

[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:19.840]
You ought to read it.

[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:21.360]
I'll do even if you don't like sports.

[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.680]
It's so melee mouth.

[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:23.380]
Okay, there's nothing.

[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:25.400]
It's like having pancakes that are melee.

[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.000]
You know what I mean?

[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.020]
Oh, hit that.

[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:27.320]
Great.

[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:29.980]
When I hate, I hate people who are melee mouth.

[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:31.760]
Even if I disagree with you, 100%.

[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:35.520]
Even like Rush, I can't stand Limbaugh, especially with his lies.

[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.160]
But at least he, you know, says it like he sees it, which is full of crap.

[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:40.980]
But at least he opens up a big fat mouth.

[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:43.300]
And by the way, since he opened up a big fat mouth,

[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:46.340]
the Eagles haven't lost the game about Donavig McNeibb and Stephen Nair,

[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:47.900]
by the way, even though they lost the other day.

[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:49.500]
I mean, there's so many black quarterbacks.

[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:53.920]
It's just so obviously a racial thing intended like get everybody whipped up into a frenzy.

[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.840]
I hope Rosa Parks beats the crap out of him.

[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.180]
Anyway, what's your take?

[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:01.700]
We'll both look it up during the break and one of us will find something.

[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.140]
I don't think we're one.

[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:08.280]
My point being that putting a Libraban on Nair was like the kiss of death in the Yahoo States.

[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.980]
Even his own state of Tennessee.

[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:10.720]
Did he win it?

[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:10.960]
No.

[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.660]
No, he, how many electoral votes does Tennessee got?

[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:15.920]
Well, at least I can find that here.

[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:19.800]
It's got 11.

[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:20.900]
That would have done it.

[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:22.760]
Don't you think?

[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:23.580]
Yeah.

[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.180]
Here it is.

[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:25.740]
I got it.

[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:26.280]
You got it?

[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:28.200]
I told you we're good at this.

[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.800]
Oh, it's got the 2000 electoral and what does it say?

[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.320]
Does it have the breakdown of who won what?

[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:35.640]
Yeah, who's going to get it?

[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:36.920]
What the red and the blue map?

[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.220]
You want me to email you the link?

[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.260]
Oh, that would be great.

[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:41.580]
I'll do it right now because I actually know what some of those states are.

[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:44.340]
Like a big penis yellow one that's hanging down there when you go.

[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.620]
This is great because when you run the mouse over the map,

[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:49.620]
it highlights it gives you the exact breakdown.

[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.280]
You can in Bush, Nair, Gore, etc.

[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:53.640]
When I rub my mouse over the map, it goes,

[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:54.980]
I'm like that.

[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:58.320]
So I must have a faulty and defective mouse.

[01:17:58.780 --> 01:17:59.580]
Believe you me.

[01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:02.200]
I was born with an defective mouse.

[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:03.140]
It's a sad thing.

[01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:06.140]
What's your take on Al Gore's endorsement of Howard Dean?

[01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:07.080]
It'll help Dean a lot.

[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:08.040]
It makes no difference.

[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.800]
It actually will hurt Dean.

[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.280]
I was going to say vast difference.

[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.380]
But then it can vast difference is like part of the penis.

[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:14.760]
Right?

[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:15.100]
Different.

[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:15.940]
Yeah, it's a tube.

[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:17.420]
It's a tube in the penis.

[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:18.160]
It's a tube.

[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.400]
Oh, I hate when they do that.

[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.720]
It'll help Dean a lot.

[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:21.540]
It makes no difference.

[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:22.560]
It'll actually hurt Dean,

[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.120]
especially if they stick a tube in the penis.

[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:25.920]
If guaranteed, it's the nomination for Dean.

[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:26.440]
Or I don't care.

[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.060]
I'm for Bush.

[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:28.240]
I'm for Bush, baby.

[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.240]
I'm a Bush man.

[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.340]
And nothing you tell me is going to change my mind.

[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:31.940]
You got it.

[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:32.860]
It's right there in your email.

[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.920]
It's oh, you put it on the email instead of like faxing it to me.

[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:36.420]
Which is an easy.

[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.320]
This is an interactive page.

[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.320]
And how are you going to get the colors on the fax machine?

[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:41.440]
Oh, I see.

[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:41.880]
Very good.

[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:42.860]
Well, I got a vote first.

[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:44.840]
It'll help Dean a lot.

[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:45.840]
Okay?

[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:47.780]
That's what I voted just to get that chin going.

[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:49.100]
20,000.

[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:51.160]
And here's something to help you folks a lot through in the holidays.

[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.000]
That's the Emerald Coast Chinese buffet.

[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.420]
Why not let the number one Asian buffet restaurant in the world.

[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.980]
The Emerald Coast do all the cooking for you this holiday season.

[01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.300]
It'll be a piece of cake.

[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.080]
Reserve your holiday party right now.

[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.220]
The Emerald Coast is going to accommodate even the largest groups

[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:05.140]
like maybe 10 or 20 or even.

[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.100]
About 30, man.

[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:08.760]
Start your mouth watering eating experience with one or more of

[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.540]
six different delicious soups like your hot and sour and your wanton.

[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.420]
Then sample dozens of succulent entrees like New York Strip made

[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:14.680]
ordered.

[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.560]
There's sizzling Asian grill along with the brand new seafood saying

[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:20.380]
Jacques and so much more like oysters on a half shell every night.

[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:23.700]
If that isn't enough, try the relascan stone crab middle neck clams.

[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.880]
I always thought it was little neck clams, didn't you?

[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:26.820]
No.

[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:28.480]
It's middle neck clams.

[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.120]
I didn't hear of either one of them.

[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:31.900]
Oh, jumbo shrimp scampi.

[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:33.960]
And after the first time, main lobster on weekends.

[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.460]
If you still have room, sample their hand-carved prime rib.

[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:38.140]
Their new Thai specialties too.

[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:40.300]
The Emerald Coast promotes a healthy living service.

[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:43.480]
They don't use any crab, no MSG, no cornstarch.

[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.740]
You'll never walk out of there with a headache.

[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:46.800]
Just a big smile on your post and they cook everything

[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.620]
only with cholesterol free oil too.

[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.340]
The buffet features a full salad bar, the new sushi bar,

[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:52.160]
fresh room cocktail.

[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.000]
And if you have any room at all, like I said,

[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.080]
bring a big sack and shove this some dessert in there

[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.060]
because they've got a great dessert station featuring Belgian waffles.

[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:00.040]
Waffles.

[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:01.980]
Where is Randy Waffles anyway?

[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:04.620]
Belgian waffles pies, cakes, pastries, ice cream,

[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.580]
all your favorite toppings and fresh fruit.

[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.200]
The perfect ending to a perfect gigantic, not just a meal,

[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:09.880]
but a pig out.

[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.160]
Emerald Coast, three locations for you in South Florida.

[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.880]
They're on sunrise at Pine Island in sunrise.

[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.080]
They're in that place.

[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:18.700]
Pine Island of 44th Street, Collins Avenue,

[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.700]
just north of 163rd Street, North Miami Beach.

[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:22.520]
And at the intersection of flamingo and pepper crods

[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:23.300]
in Pembroke Pines.

[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.460]
So take the whole family that got some ishfuhl

[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:27.080]
or book your next business lunch in right now

[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.440]
or for the holidays, let these folks do the cooking for you.

[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:37.180]
Take out delivery always available, call 954-5723822-954-5723822

[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:39.860]
for the world amazing Emerald Coast Chinese buffet.

[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:41.760]
Live and local.

[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.940]
We're sports radio five cities, you and you, A.M.

[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.100]
Well, I'm so busy.

[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:53.160]
No, an open letter to all movie critics from the cat in the hat.

[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.760]
To all those who shed my movie would bomb.

[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.800]
I'm as big a star as Ben Zed or Tom.

[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:04.140]
40 million in ticket sold and so I beat the Jesus out of Russell Crowe.

[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:06.120]
I'm the highest thing in Hollywood.

[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.580]
I did it when no one said I could.

[01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:12.520]
To all those mean, hateful, no stammers would drive their Mercedes

[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.200]
and shiny black hummers.

[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:17.280]
Now go eat your words, you fuzzy jean shallot

[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.540]
and pummel yourself in their head with a mallet.

[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.960]
To wrecks a two-witchet, to Roger and Joel.

[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.880]
Shove it up your butt with a big grease pole.

[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.520]
This cat is on top of the office of bucks

[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.920]
and all of your heads are full of rocks.

[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.160]
Now all can be jealous of this red hot kitty

[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.860]
who's wearing hot-bling and snoop or pee-ditty.

[01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:40.020]
The freaks and the holes all over my crib last night

[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.800]
making love by Broke a Grim.

[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:44.580]
So screw all the critics who doubted the cat.

[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:48.100]
Let them all make a poopy and my giant striped hat.

[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:50.480]
This has been an open letter to all movie critics

[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.520]
from the cat in the hat.

[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.300]
Some of the words if I said Tom Brady is an MILS

[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:55.360]
would that have some significance?

[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:56.480]
What's that?

[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.600]
Anyway, I got some bad news for you.

[01:21:58.860 --> 01:21:59.000]
Yeah.

[01:21:59.300 --> 01:21:59.920]
Email that you sent me.

[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.120]
See, I told you, you could do the easy way,

[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:03.980]
the sure way you're always got to email.

[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.040]
You're always going to email.

[01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:06.000]
Guess what?

[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:07.000]
I'm trying to open up the email.

[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.820]
It says hotmail is permanently blocked

[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:11.180]
of following potentially unsafe attachments.

[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:12.800]
President.org.

[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:14.580]
How do you like that?

[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:14.780]

[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.100]
You could do that.

[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:17.920]
So you're trying to feed me some kind of a virus

[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.900]
or some kind of like a crack or something like that.

[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:22.120]
You're trying to feed some warm into my computer.

[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:22.860]
From ABC News.

[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.280]
Well, guess what?

[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:26.260]
Hot Mio's permanently blocked it.

[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.640]
They said, Vafon Gula, baby.

[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.500]
You're not getting a missing.

[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:29.600]
ABC News.

[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:31.540]
Oh, wait a minute.

[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:33.200]
Well, in other words, my search.

[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.400]
Where's the website?

[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:34.920]
This is the website.

[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:36.760]
Well, I can't do that.

[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:37.700]
Now I got like 8 million.

[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.660]
Because of you, look at that thing.

[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:40.760]
I got a URL up there.

[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.200]
It's got 40,000 words in it.

[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:43.640]
Maybe not 40,000.

[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.540]
Not good, man.

[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:47.080]
60, five votes.

[01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:48.580]
What's your take on out of words endorsement

[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:49.060]
or howardine?

[01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:49.800]
It'll help dean a lot.

[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:50.220]
27.

[01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:51.000]
It'll make no difference.

[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:51.400]
16.

[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:51.920]
I don't care.

[01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:52.360]
I'm for Bush.

[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:54.160]
10, 15.3%.

[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:56.720]
It guarantees the nomination for D9.

[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.280]
It'll actually hurt Dean three.

[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.060]
I don't even know why I put that on there.

[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:00.960]
But I knew somebody to vote for.

[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:01.460]
And I was right.

[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:02.240]
Okay.

[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.080]
Now what's the website?

[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:06.020]
One moment, please.

[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.100]
I was trying to print it.

[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:12.060]
And I'm having prints and problems as you know.

[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:12.880]
Why?

[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:14.020]
Are they still going on?

[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:14.380]
Yeah.

[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:16.480]
Oh, I thought stuff in terms of being in their

[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:16.780]
electorate.

[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:17.180]

[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:17.580]
You're funny.

[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:18.920]
This thing's long as a mile.

[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:22.920]
We can't do this on the air.

[01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:23.780]
Okay.

[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:24.620]
I'll write it down in the website.

[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:25.500]
Are you taking me to website?

[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:26.800]
Well, please.

[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:28.700]
So in other words, you can't faction to me either?

[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:29.000]
Either.

[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:29.720]
No.

[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:31.440]
I'll fax you the website.

[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:35.380]
I can't print it up.

[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:36.940]
I got to write it down and fax that.

[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:38.040]
Oh my god.

[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:38.740]
What a joke.

[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.000]
Everything here is working fine in my

[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.300]
palatial Toronto studio.

[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:44.940]
Another reason I can't possibly be more than

[01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:46.080]
a few weeks in that joint.

[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.700]
I told you the fruit you were on vacation.

[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:50.780]
That week, the first day I sat down there on a Monday morning.

[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:51.780]
I wanted to tear my hair out.

[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:52.880]
The phone was all screwed up.

[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.420]
And the thing just like you were having

[01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:55.440]
wouldn't print anything out.

[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:55.720]
Mm-hmm.

[01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:56.200]
Man.

[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:58.400]
It answered your question.

[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.500]
No, he did not win any Southern states.

[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:01.080]
Well, there you go.

[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:01.360]
Let's see.

[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:02.080]
We went through all of that.

[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.320]
Killed about 15 minutes doing it.

[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:03.960]
Nice going guys.

[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:04.380]
Thank you.

[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:08.540]
Did not win Louisiana, Alabama with a banjo on his knee.

[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:12.480]
Mississippi, Marlowe and New Mexico are his southern as it got.

[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:15.100]
Well, Maryland is not exactly what you call a Southern state.

[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.620]
And either New Mexico hardly considered a Southern state.

[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:18.360]
Illinois, Iowa.

[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:19.560]
No, no, no.

[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:21.160]
Pennsylvania.

[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.100]
Last time I checked this without somebody.

[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:24.360]
I know New York, New Jersey,

[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:25.900]
Vermont, New Hampshire.

[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.260]
Um, he went to Hampshire.

[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:29.300]
Maine.

[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:31.680]
No need to go when you're in New Hampshire.

[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:33.340]
New Hampshire was the only state in the wheel that he lost.

[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:33.880]
Right.

[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:35.620]
Michigan.

[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:36.240]
Yes.

[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:37.840]
I'm doing this from memory, of course.

[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:38.620]
Very out of four in.

[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:38.760]
Yeah.

[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.500]
See Washington, Oregon.

[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:41.740]
No, not not Oregon.

[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:42.200]
Washington.

[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:42.680]
Yes, Oregon.

[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:43.800]
Oh my god.

[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:45.040]
That's depressing.

[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:45.300]

[01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:47.020]
Illinois's see.

[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:47.960]
He lost Ohio.

[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:49.620]
Yes, he did.

[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:50.180]
Yeah.

[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.480]
And the code is he did not win either one of them.

[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:54.340]
Those names of all places.

[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:55.120]
Didn't know Montana.

[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.340]
Or Oklahoma.

[01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:57.640]
No, or Texas.

[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.600]
Arizona or Zona or Utah or Wyoming.

[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:02.200]
No, he won Hawaii.

[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:04.180]
Lost Alaska.

[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:04.620]
Right.

[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:05.600]
I think that's it.

[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:06.160]
That's it.

[01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:07.600]
Very good.

[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:08.260]
Isn't it?

[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:11.420]
Well, we don't have to mention all the seven states like the

[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:13.580]
Carolina's because like you said, nothing to be fine.

[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.540]
They're losing Carolina.

[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:16.820]
Ivan Fax is here.

[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:18.220]
It says I was listening to your program yesterday.

[01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:19.260]
I went back from an interview.

[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:21.120]
I lost my high paying job two plus years ago.

[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:23.580]
Like those three million other people out there who aren't quite

[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.380]
cheering in this great economic comeback.

[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.220]
That they keep giving us a song in advance about.

[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:28.700]
Oh, downtown thousand.

[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:29.320]
Yeah, I remember.

[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:30.180]
It was 11, seven.

[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:31.900]
Okay, downtown thousand.

[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:32.400]
My ass.

[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:33.820]
And by the way, at eight, 10,000.

[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.500]
It's what is it?

[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:37.320]
99, 77.

[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.640]
I just can't quite get it up.

[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.240]
It's like, and then it falls again.

[01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:42.720]
But then of course, 245, an Ellen Green Spun.

[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:44.320]
Makes his big announcement there.

[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:46.040]
215 or whatever it is this afternoon.

[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:46.920]
Oh, wow.

[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:49.360]
We're going to keep interest rates to say the American dollar.

[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:51.440]
Let me tell you right now is worth a dime.

[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:52.820]
It ain't worth a crap.

[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:54.240]
You could just wipe your ass with it.

[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:57.800]
You know that the euro is like, I don't only want to look at it today.

[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:00.580]
Over 122.

[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:02.880]
You know what it was about a year and a half ago?

[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:03.920]
92 cent.

[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.880]
And now it's 122 against the dollar.

[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.840]
The Canadian dollar a year and a half ago was 62 cent.

[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.140]
Now it's 77 plus.

[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.200]
It's enough to make it gag.

[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.760]
But anyway, Ivan says I was listening to your program yesterday.

[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:21.300]
My way back from an interview when I heard you ask about Puerto Rican delicacies.

[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:24.680]
Having been there so many times here are some for Pudge.

[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.360]
Just as we send Pudge packing.

[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:28.500]
So instead of sending him a pack of my sandwich,

[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:29.660]
we'll pack him a mofongo.

[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:32.720]
Hey, mofongo, uh, uh, uh, uh, Pudge.

[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:34.640]
Ivan, look at this.

[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:36.940]
I, how do you like that?

[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.020]
Yeah, that's what Ivan is.

[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.640]
See as in Ivan Pudge Rodriguez.

[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:41.320]
See?

[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:43.660]
I'll be damned.

[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.540]
Mofongo is like a Boston post on.

[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:47.760]
It was like a big post on it.

[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:51.260]
A mashed green plantains that have been fried and shaped in large container.

[01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:52.140]
Maybe filled with meat,

[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:53.460]
shrimp, keel or lobster, keel.

[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:55.940]
Normally served in container that resembles a mortar.

[01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:58.800]
Wow, I'm mortified here and at.

[01:26:59.260 --> 01:26:59.580]
Aren't you?

[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:00.380]
Yeah, mine.

[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:04.320]
Pastels, very similar to tamales, but made of mashed green plantains.

[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:07.020]
And has some kind of meat, i.e. chicken, pork, etc.

[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.360]
Or human remains in a creole sauce.

[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:12.080]
And the entire mass is wrapped in a banana leaf and then

[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.300]
placed in a hot water until the cook.

[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:13.860]
Yeah, mine.

[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:15.720]
But it's nothing like human excrement in the, uh,

[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:16.340]
Creole sauce.

[01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:19.540]
See, that's what they do is they do anything they put in anything

[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:21.540]
Flaying around just seven and seven or creole sauce.

[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:22.540]
It's good for you.

[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:23.840]
Alcapulias.

[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:27.000]
It's a fritter made of mashed green plantains that have been

[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.520]
a filling like meat or seafood.

[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:30.100]
A fritter.

[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.800]
You know, I haven't had a corn fritter in about a hundred years.

[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:33.580]
They either.

[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:34.240]
That's good.

[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:34.900]
Hush puppies.

[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.100]
Where did you, we're used to get corn fritters?

[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:38.340]
Like into fear?

[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:39.360]
Okay.

[01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:40.380]
That's what I can.

[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:41.300]
Can I do fear something like that?

[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:41.900]
Corn fritters.

[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:42.860]
They gave them to us in school.

[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:45.020]
And I hope our pronounce is right, Yvonne.

[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:45.680]
Cookito.

[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:46.880]
Y'all have one of those.

[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:47.040]
Right.

[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:47.920]
His little coconut.

[01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:53.160]
It's the typical Puerto Rican eggnog having rum and coconut to flavor the eggnog.

[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:54.980]
Normally the Latin eggnog is heavy on the rum.

[01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:57.720]
Well, of course it is because then Latinos man,

[01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:59.080]
they like to get a little uh,

[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:01.220]
cock-eyed little goofed up.

[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:01.780]
Come on.

[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.800]
Worked at the party last night is what I'm hearing.

[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:05.680]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:10.440]
Found 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.320]
But a good time was had by all.

[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.980]
Here's, uh, let's see.

[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:16.100]
One of our perverted, uh,

[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:17.840]
factitious is watching an ultra-winey,

[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:19.820]
espank classic with Howard Cosell.

[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:21.300]
He rubbed elbows with the elite.

[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:21.920]
He was respected.

[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.100]
He was and is a legend.

[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.880]
I believe Mo thinks he is on Cosell's level.

[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:26.360]
Absolutely.

[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:28.240]
I want to joke the way he drops names

[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.680]
and acts like an arrogant snob.

[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.280]
But Mo is a schmo.

[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:32.140]
Right.

[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:33.060]
So our chronic facts.

[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:34.080]
How do you like that?

[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:36.600]
Let's see.

[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:39.620]
Yesterday, Mr. Ego states to his trove of color

[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:41.620]
that he would like to put the rest in the rumors

[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:43.440]
that he's considering the vacated slot.

[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:44.100]
I'm WQM.

[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:45.800]
There was previously filed by Scott Farrell.

[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:46.760]
Oh my god.

[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:49.780]
Oh, you know what I'm talking about?

[01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:51.380]
This is the joke in a century,

[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:52.940]
because this is the best.

[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.720]
This made my day, my week,

[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:55.900]
and made my entire life.

[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.240]
Mr. Ego, Steve K,

[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:00.920]
is denying officially that he's not considering...

[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:13.720]
Wow.

[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:13.920]
Wow.

[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:17.260]
He states to his trove of color

[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:18.880]
that he would like to put the rest in any rumors

[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.480]
that he's considering the vacated slot

[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.180]
on WQM.

[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.760]
There was previously filed by Scott Farrell.

[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:25.520]
Mr. Ego stated he makes more money on his current show

[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:27.860]
would have to take a cut and pay to move the QAM.

[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:29.940]
Also, he thought very carefully about this.

[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:32.080]
Did not think that Brandon talked with work well before

[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:34.400]
the very old Neo-Rajor shows his Chris.

[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:35.860]
Right, Mr. Ego.

[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.620]
With your 14-old cocker listeners,

[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:38.740]
right, talk about old.

[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:40.040]
Rumor started by...

[01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:41.580]
I beg your pardon?

[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:42.460]
Rumor started by.

[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:44.120]
By him?

[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:44.640]
I see.

[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:48.080]
Here's a fact that says,

[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.640]
I just received this email from the true majority.

[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:51.120]
It says,

[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:53.800]
Pants on fire is coming to Florida taking for a spin.

[01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:54.940]
What does this mean?

[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:55.600]
I don't know.

[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:57.640]
I figured you could translate it.

[01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:58.740]
I have no idea what that means.

[01:29:59.040 --> 01:29:59.700]
So it's gay to be out of this.

[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:02.120]
I've seen some guys who acted like they had their Pants on fire.

[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:04.240]
Neither they host John.

[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:06.960]
But the old flame out.

[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.400]
Barbara CD dodges drug sludge.

[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.060]
I love this.

[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:14.540]
As again, the right wingers, they just throw a lot of crap up there.

[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:15.560]
Hope that it hits the ceiling.

[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:16.580]
Well, this one...

[01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:18.020]
Then do it, then do it, Matt.

[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:19.160]
Miss Fudge.

[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:22.180]
The New York Daily News reports today.

[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.020]
Barbara Strysans, who outed another right wing,

[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:24.800]
hooked this weekend.

[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:27.220]
Conservative Internet Gossip, Matt Drudge,

[01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:28.480]
aka Miss Fudge,

[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:30.560]
posted a story Sunday that the liberal singer

[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:32.200]
may be stripped of her Grammy nomination

[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.820]
since her album was in stores two weeks after the deadline.

[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:36.760]
Not only did you have it on the website,

[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:38.540]
but like breathlessly with a huge picture

[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:39.780]
and a gigantic headline,

[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:42.340]
the movie album on which the 61-year-old performer

[01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:43.860]
sang Smile Other Film Songs

[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.340]
in front of a 75-piece orchestra

[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:48.140]
was nominated in the best traditional pop vocal category.

[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.700]
The CD was released to records through his October 14,

[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.760]
after the September 30, what day?

[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:53.880]
About 30, man.

[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.360]
Cut off set by the National Academy

[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.440]
of Recording Arts and Sciences.

[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.640]
Ironically, it was available on technology.

[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:00.600]
Nobody knows how to use better than Drudge.

[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:02.920]
The movie album was available as a full album

[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:06.640]
commercially via download on www.bimusic.com

[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:08.680]
as of September 30th on Columbia Records,

[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:10.340]
spokeswoman Claire Mercuri told us,

[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.420]
which meets of course the Grammy eligibility.

[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.640]
Nearest spokesman Diane Trio said

[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:17.620]
Sony's documentation was fully acceptable.

[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:18.500]
No problem.

[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:19.560]
And Miss Fudge, once again,

[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.680]
gets it wrong, gets it wrong,

[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:24.340]
but too much hanky-panky with Miss Kuntz, I think.

[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:25.880]
Be careful how you say that.

[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:26.720]
I'll wait.

[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:27.580]
We got the latest also

[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:28.900]
that these New York TV News got the latest

[01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:30.140]
and Howard Stern and Don Amistad,

[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:31.440]
a little countertops that's kind of a museum.

[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:31.980]
We'll get to it.

[01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:35.020]
I still don't have that, Matt.

[01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:38.000]
I fact the address.

[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:39.920]
Thank God.

[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.120]
Well, this is quite a project.

[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:41.500]
I made it.

[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:43.860]
ABCNews.goat.com

[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:44.660]
this section.

[01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:46.300]
Go to Hell, stick it in your nose.

[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.680]
But it's excellent once you get there.

[01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:49.480]
It's very thorough.

[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:52.180]
Well, that's fan hit tomorrow is with the Scot Jr.

[01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:54.860]
at a place to be determined, right?

[01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:57.920]
Got 45,045 bucks.

[01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.000]
We're over 45 grand.

[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.120]
Anyway, we'll make our 50.

[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.800]
I hope today's December 1 night.

[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:02.360]
Right.

[01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:03.500]
Five out of shot, man.

[01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:04.860]
We just like Jimmy Johnson said,

[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:05.760]
we got a shot.

[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:07.380]
We'll have the best of the merchandise.

[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:08.800]
Andy, Joe and Mark Toydrive,

[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:09.640]
11 and 2 tomorrow.

[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:10.640]
We'll let you know where it's going to be

[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:11.660]
because it doesn't stay on this thing.

[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:12.000]
Do we know?

[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:12.360]
No.

[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:12.660]
We don't know.

[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:14.320]
Let me tell you right now,

[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.100]
if you want to lose some weight,

[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:15.920]
Husker Trina doing,

[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:17.120]
she had lost 10 and a half pounds

[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.120]
as the last time we checked her

[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.400]
the last week on balance for life.

[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:19.880]
That's right.

[01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:22.880]
See, everybody that does it and sticks with it,

[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:23.400]
they lose weight.

[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:24.020]
That's the key.

[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:26.520]
And of course, the reason it's so easy to stick with balance

[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:27.400]
for life unless you're a real

[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:28.760]
disgusting pig like the beast

[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:30.020]
is the fact is that

[01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:32.100]
they, you don't have to worry about what to eat

[01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:33.960]
because they do it all for it,

[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:34.840]
except filling out the menu.

[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:35.760]
You do that once a week.

[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:36.680]
You fax it back to them.

[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:38.360]
And then they send you right to your door

[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:39.320]
exactly what you want.

[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.580]
And there's plenty of food in there.

[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:41.620]
You don't have to go off the wagon

[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:43.120]
because balance for life delivers

[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.380]
in that black sack every morning.

[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.240]
Three gourmet meals.

[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.280]
Two delicious nights right to your doorstep.

[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.340]
It'd work at home wherever you like.

[01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:49.720]
And you'll be full and happy

[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:50.800]
and satisfied all day long.

[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:52.580]
We're not talking about pre-fabricated

[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:53.780]
crap like some of those others.

[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:54.980]
I don't want to say Jenny Craig,

[01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:56.080]
wait, watch your things like that.

[01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:57.820]
We're talking about fresh, delicious goodies.

[01:32:58.060 --> 01:32:58.660]
Stuff that you love.

[01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:00.320]
So let balance for life finally.

[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:01.700]
Once and for all, help you lose the weight.

[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:02.960]
There's no calorie counting.

[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:03.720]
No carb counting.

[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.780]
Nothing except eating fresh, delicious food.

[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.600]
And washing away poor off on that scale

[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:08.640]

[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:37.500]
I've seen Steve Goldstein, but you can call me Kelsey.

[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:39.440]
Whenever I'm in town, I listen to...

[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.640]
Wait a minute, I am in town.

[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:42.440]
It's the 12th of one hour.

[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:43.300]
That...

[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:47.420]
Rupert got the big move gone from survivor.

[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:52.560]
Talking like a pirate with an evil stare.

[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:55.380]
Is nobody covered up with dark white hair?

[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:58.080]
People bought it when they considered a sin.

[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:00.760]
He took the other tribes' shoes and sold her underwear.

[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.620]
Rupert got the big move gone from survivor.

[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:07.000]
All right.

[01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:10.660]
One damn their every challenge, but I guess it hurt.

[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:13.400]
Everyone got tired of his stupid skirt.

[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.300]
They put out his porch Santa back to his front porch.

[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:18.980]
Now the only thing he wins is his filthy tie-dye shirt.

[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:23.800]
Rupert got the big move gone from survivor.

[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.740]
Merton wanted Rupert because he came back.

[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:31.400]
He and fellow, I guess, will are back contract.

[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:35.040]
They're calling the shot second like Tukaki's not sent the latest.

[01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:37.060]
One the fall was the big old bumper jack.

[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:41.840]
Rupert got the big move gone from survivor.

[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:49.620]
Now I have no interest in the way it ends.

[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:54.500]
Yes, I'll just go back to NBC and friends.

[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:58.680]
Insurrect and shame, God, I just can't stand this.

[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:02.740]
I'd like to go there myself and bring it.

[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.260]
Re-camera lens.

[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:09.060]
The Rupert got the big move gone from survivor.

[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:16.640]
He is gone from survivor.

[01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:19.680]
Oh, promo three.

[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:20.260]
And guess what?

[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.020]
You know that long URL you sent me?

[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.640]
Yeah, I typed it all in.

[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:25.920]
It said, sorry, but the site that you're researching

[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:27.140]
is no longer available.

[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:32.360]
So then I went to I typed in 2000 bush gore election

[01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:35.280]
electoral state by state electoral result.

[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.640]
And here's the CNN thing.

[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:36.880]

[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:40.340]
I don't have no pretty man, but I got the numbers I wanted.

[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:41.420]
And I was right.

[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:43.880]
Tennessee with its 11 electoral votes, I would have put

[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.540]
a girl over the top.

[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:45.120]
It's home state.

[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:45.780]
Right.

[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:47.000]
Didn't win it.

[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:49.020]
Number one, he didn't have Clinton coming.

[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:50.540]
He didn't have bubble coming campaign with him.

[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:52.540]
But number two, speaking of bubble miceys,

[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:53.920]
he had an agreement on the ticket.

[01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:55.600]
They don't like no Jews in Tennessee,

[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.020]
Mr. Autoray that right now.

[01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:58.960]
I was in Nashville for a month in 1980.

[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.880]
And you won't be no Jews in Nashville.

[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:01.920]
I kick your ass right out.

[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:03.040]
Even now.

[01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:05.080]
See what I'm saying?

[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:05.960]
Yeah.

[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:09.320]
Tennessee, 11 were to give and gore 277

[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:12.480]
and given bush 260.

[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.620]
Put Al right over the top.

[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:15.580]
Needed to win 270.

[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:16.220]
Got it?

[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:17.120]
So he got it.

[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:18.460]
They couldn't have fixed it in Florida.

[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.920]
Because then, see they wouldn't have wasted their time in Florida

[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:22.400]
and grow what had gotten the right count.

[01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:23.200]
And he would have won that too.

[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:24.440]
So we'll have another landslide.

[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:27.480]
He had had a comfortable victory just with one state,

[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:28.800]
his home state of Tennessee.

[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:29.560]
Damn it.

[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:32.300]
Gosh dang is Bud Paxen would say.

[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:33.700]
Gosh dang Italians.

[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:39.520]
Man, California, Connecticut, DC, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa,

[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:41.040]
Illinois, Massachusetts,

[01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:45.220]
Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, Michigan, New Jersey,

[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:47.120]
New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania,

[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:49.160]
Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin.

[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:50.960]
Those who were living and breathing people

[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:52.180]
lived, the grow one, all of those.

[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:56.220]
Look at the states that bush one man, I rest my case.

[01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:56.840]
Arkansas.

[01:36:57.340 --> 01:36:58.000]
Oh, that's from Clinton.

[01:36:58.900 --> 01:36:59.340]
Alabama.

[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:01.100]
Anybody living and breathing Alabama?

[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:01.520]
No.

[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:02.200]
No Jews allowed.

[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:03.140]
Arizona.

[01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:06.640]
Bastion of the right wing extremists like I said last week

[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:08.000]
who all got kicked out of California.

[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:12.080]
What those AR?

[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:15.220]
Arkansas?

[01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:15.960]
No.

[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:17.860]
Arkansas is AK.

[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.920]
I thought AK said it for auto conquerors.

[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:21.500]
Oh Alaska, I see.

[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:23.960]
I don't know chance Alaska with Ted Stevens up there.

[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:25.440]
But you're right winged lunatics.

[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:26.960]
Colorado.

[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:28.840]
Well Colorado could be I don't know.

[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:29.980]
Not a right wingers there too.

[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:31.480]
Florida, which we know was fixed.

[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:32.920]
Georgia Idaho.

[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:34.700]
USC, any Jews in Idaho?

[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:35.240]
No.

[01:37:35.540 --> 01:37:36.460]
No, not even North.

[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:39.920]
Indiana, Indiana where they talk like like they're in Texas.

[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.100]
Somebody, somebody forgot to tell them where they are on the map.

[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:45.940]
I told you this a long time ago and trust me do not ever go to Indianapolis

[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:48.480]
unless it's to visit our friends Bob and Tom because of their net.

[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:49.020]
They're ain't nothing.

[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:49.560]
They're in Schmidt.

[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:53.120]
You go to Indianapolis and you look on the map.

[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:54.840]
It's like right in the center of the country, right?

[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:56.640]
Well, man.

[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:00.560]
They talk in Indian not in four way or the northern part.

[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.660]
But in the southern part of the state with a real heavy draw.

[01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:04.020]
Kansas.

[01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:06.960]
Oh forget about that Kentucky rednecks.

[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:09.380]
Louisiana more rednecks misery.

[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:12.600]
Well that's a John Ascroff probably put the fix in there.

[01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:15.300]
Mississippi Montana North Carolina North Dakota.

[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:17.560]
What's any?

[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:19.740]
Nebraska?

[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:23.360]
And oh, any is a Nebraska red.

[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:24.240]
And V is Nevada.

[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:24.920]
New Hampshire.

[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.300]
Kind of surprised about Nevada.

[01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:28.320]
That was only four though.

[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:29.820]
All right, you know something.

[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:33.320]
If if Grewet of one Nevada, he'd have won four electoral votes.

[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:34.400]
Don't bet on it now.

[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:35.260]
Four.

[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:38.260]
That would have given him 270 and boost 267.

[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:42.560]
Four little teeny tiny votes in the dice roll and state of Nevada.

[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:48.380]
Ohio Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah.

[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:49.320]
Virginia West Virginia.

[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.140]
Why Wyoming?

[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:52.100]
How could they have both won the West Virginia?

[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:52.880]
Oh, they didn't.

[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:55.360]
Washington was the one I said before.

[01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:55.800]
My mistake.

[01:38:55.900 --> 01:38:56.660]
My bad Washington.

[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:57.920]
Grewet one West Virginia.

[01:38:57.980 --> 01:38:58.320]
Wyoming.

[01:38:58.580 --> 01:38:59.040]
Of course.

[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:00.300]
Bush.

[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:01.680]
West Virginia.

[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:02.500]
Low and that would have done it.

[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.360]
They usually goes Democratic in presidential elections.

[01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:06.480]
West Virginia's got five without it done the job.

[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:07.380]
Even that one.

[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.880]
So in any of those states, any of these things he wouldn't

[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:12.000]
have to have the whole business with Florida and the.

[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:15.260]
Chads and all the embarrassment and humiliation and the war

[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:16.400]
and Iraq and all these dead people.

[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:17.680]
How do you like that?

[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:19.880]
I just mentioned this in passing because again,

[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.340]
this is the only show you'll hear it on.

[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:22.220]
It's the truth.

[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:23.680]
I don't care what anybody says.

[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:26.500]
There is no way that a bunch of red necks in Mugwam states.

[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:29.600]
There's no chance even a southern guy like Al Gore from Tennessee

[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:32.480]
is even through after eight years of unprecedented prosperity

[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:35.000]
and all the big budget surplus that's all vanished.

[01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:36.540]
There's no way that them or go.

[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.960]
I'm going to vote for a Jew on the ticket.

[01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:39.340]
See what I'm saying?

[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:39.800]
Yeah.

[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:41.720]
I don't tell anybody about Howard Dean's wife.

[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:42.460]
Anyway, okay.

[01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:43.520]
Move along fast.

[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.900]
New York Daily News today says

[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:49.800]
way more than 24 hours of pass since Howard Stern threatened

[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:51.680]
to reveal information about what had done.

[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:54.780]
I'm his daughter's if I'm as didn't apologize to Stern's gal pal.

[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:55.440]
I apologize.

[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.560]
Which inspires me to play something I haven't played yet today.

[01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:01.100]
I miss these some boring.

[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:04.180]
What's better than a live radio show every morning on TV?

[01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:05.460]
Well, just about anything.

[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:09.460]
But that hasn't stopped MSNBC from teaning up with radio's original bad boy

[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:10.940]
who now looks like a nasty old lady.

[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:12.180]
Listen, Bernie, I miss.

[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:13.820]
So that intern has coffee sucks.

[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:15.880]
Yes, every morning, seat I miss.

[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:17.780]
Listen to a tape of other people's county vids.

[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:18.400]
Why, Bob?

[01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:18.880]
On the air.

[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:20.480]
I need a hammer to bite into this muck.

[01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:22.380]
I need somebody to pass the press one, play it like you.

[01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:24.400]
See his wild behind the scenes at it.

[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:25.420]
I have some of these different.

[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.720]
I have the eye-manual, walrus, cucko-catchew,

[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:29.440]
and I get me some fresh coffee or your fire.

[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:30.040]
I miss.

[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:31.020]
He's irreverent.

[01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:32.260]
So I want to deal with the poll.

[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.300]
He's topical.

[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:34.780]
No, I want to deal with his water game.

[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:36.400]
He's incoherent.

[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:38.420]
I'll tell you what, that's a government president.

[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:39.400]
What the hell is this?

[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:39.720]
I don't know.

[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.240]
He's I miss.

[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:44.300]
And he's only on MSNBC.

[01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:45.820]
A cable channel nobody watches.

[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:48.200]
And a bunch of AM radio stations nobody listens to.

[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:50.680]
And when somebody gets some fresh jingle, it's I miss.

[01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.300]
Hey, Merit, Merit.

[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:53.980]
Merit.

[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:55.440]
Many remeres.

[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:56.880]
See, I'm thinking that'd be good.

[01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:57.460]
Pulse on day.

[01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:58.460]
Who's the most incoherent?

[01:40:58.480 --> 01:40:59.260]
Are we already done that?

[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:00.160]
Incoherent?

[01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:00.800]
I don't think we have.

[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.020]
No, we've never done that.

[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:03.340]
Who's the most incoherent of them all?

[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:04.060]
Unintelligible.

[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:05.840]
Tom Broca, right?

[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:06.420]
Don I miss.

[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:06.920]
The Crow.

[01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:07.980]
Anyway, Bob Dylan.

[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.680]
Getting back to how it's permanent Don I miss.

[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:12.300]
On Thursday, I miss producer Bernard McCork

[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:13.760]
in character as Jason Williams.

[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:16.060]
Made crude comments about relations he'd supposedly

[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:17.840]
had with Stern's love Beth Astrosky.

[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:20.260]
A furious Stern called I miss a WFA

[01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:21.760]
and who's summarily hung up on him.

[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.060]
He still hasn't apologized.

[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.840]
Yesterday, the K-Rock star Howard told Stevenop magazine editor

[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:29.860]
Chauncey Hayden that it's too late for apologies now

[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:32.720]
because Stern claimed Astrosky plans on suing I miss.

[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:34.640]
That maybe difficult as the marks were made

[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.760]
during a satirical skit.

[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:37.580]
Plus, what's more, the two shock jocks

[01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:38.840]
work for the same parent company

[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:39.980]
in fin to the broad chasing?

[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:40.880]
So there you go.

[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:43.080]
But the character I'm close on between I miss

[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:46.200]
and Howard who hated each other for years and years and years

[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:49.060]
ever since Howard brought that bottle of booze in that one day.

[01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:52.100]
He used to send booze to I miss when I was in rehab.

[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:55.420]
He used to have the career send booze to his house.

[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:56.620]
Good play.

[01:41:57.340 --> 01:41:57.840]
Yeah, nice going.

[01:41:57.980 --> 01:41:58.580]
Nice going, Holly.

[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:02.920]
At any rate, 5 6 7 0 5 6, do you let's hear about

[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:05.820]
Al Gore's the audience whipped up or what?

[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.160]
Oh, he whipped up into a frenzy after this morning.

[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:10.440]
There's Paul Baggela.

[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:11.520]
They'd not be able to beat Bush.

[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.140]
That's the real concern that Democrats have.

[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:15.780]
And an alcoholic took that on head on in Harlem this morning.

[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:17.740]
He could not have helped Dean anymore.

[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:18.100]
There you go.

[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:19.760]
Al Gore got head in Harlem this morning.

[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:20.260]
Or Dean.

[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:23.320]
Yes, because he was right about the work he figured if it worked for

[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:24.300]
Bubba, it might work for him.

[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:24.860]
You know something?

[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:26.980]
If he would have got a BJ before the election either one.

[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:29.980]
The 142 votes.

[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:31.180]
What's your take?

[01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:32.780]
Can you even imagine it?

[01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:33.520]
Oh, I can't even.

[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:34.280]
I'm sorry.

[01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:35.580]
Would have put some curve in his spine.

[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:36.120]
That's for sure.

[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:37.020]
Oh, God.

[01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:39.740]
What's your take on outdoors endorsement of Howard Dean?

[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:40.680]
146 votes.

[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:42.000]
It'll help Dean a lot.

[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:42.380]
63.

[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:43.920]
It'll make no difference.

[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:44.540]
36.

[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.820]
If guaranteed that nomination for Dean 19.

[01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:47.840]
He's got it sewn up now.

[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:48.940]
They say I don't care.

[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:51.740]
I'm for Bush 19, which is 13% unlucky number.

[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:54.760]
And it like it'll actually hurt Dean nine.

[01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:57.180]
Nine said that just, you know, just to be contrary.

[01:42:58.140 --> 01:42:59.800]
Just as the Chinese say, a Zeya.

[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:01.560]
Oh, line six.

[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:02.660]
We haven't had all day today.

[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:03.380]
Have we wQAM?

[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:06.640]
QAM.

[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:06.700]
QAM.

[01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:10.780]
Going once.

[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:14.020]
Howard Dean for president line.

[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:14.780]
Oh, it's the mantra.

[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:15.660]
He's munching on it.

[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:19.860]

[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:22.940]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:26.340]
I think we have a, uh, uh, uh,

[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:28.440]
legendary character forming a QAM.

[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:29.400]
Hi, you're Pudgy.

[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:30.320]
The fat boy.

[01:43:30.780 --> 01:43:32.680]
Well, we'll have some build him a monument in front

[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:33.960]
after the various fat ass.

[01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:34.540]

[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:36.760]

Yeah, good for you.

[01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:43.040]

[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:46.560]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:47.260]
Good afternoon.

[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:48.360]
When is to you?

[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:49.860]
No, not me.

[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:50.640]
George.

[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:51.780]
Good afternoon to you.

[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:52.740]
Yeah, afternoon.

[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:53.540]
Good afternoon.

[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:54.440]
Thank you.

[01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:57.040]
My wife is the one that called you a few weeks ago

[01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:58.260]
and gave you Pudge packing.

[01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:00.440]
And I enjoy hearing it and laugh every time.

[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:01.000]
Excellent.

[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:02.180]
Well, we sent Pudge packing.

[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:03.100]
Yeah, we did.

[01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:03.960]
And we love it.

[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:05.360]
We we mapped it out.

[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:06.300]
But anyway,

[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:08.460]
when I ask you a couple of questions,

[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:11.680]
who does your voices for your little two, three minutes

[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:13.500]
gets, you know, your songs and everything?

[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:14.300]
A Reverend Jones.

[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:18.940]
Probably it's past noon at 560 WQAM.

[01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:21.200]
You don't think that was Reverend Jones?

[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:21.540]
I do.

[01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:22.640]
That was him.

[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:23.100]
Mm-hmm.

[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:25.540]
Anyway, imagine this on your next mortgage.

[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:27.120]
Imagine before you sign the deal,

[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:29.140]
you got Todd Dreck lying on your dining room table.

[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:30.480]
Right next to where the contract is.

[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:32.480]
But all the blood luckily is pouring off the left side

[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:33.940]
of the table and you're sitting over on the right hand.

[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:34.180]
Oh!

[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:37.060]
And imagine this when you do make the deal.

[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:38.120]

[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:40.040]

Zero discounted point.

[01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:46.340]
It's the last mortgage you'll ever need.

[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:47.640]
And of course, we're talking now about

[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:50.460]
the revolutionary only one mortgage from financial group.

[01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:54.840]
Now with an interest rate of just 1.95 percent,

[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.920]
that means if you have a $200,000 loan,

[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:57.760]
your payments are a mirror,

[01:44:58.540 --> 01:44:59.520]
$738 bucks a month.

And it's called the only one mortgage from financial group.

[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:21.460]

[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:24.620]
You pay zero underwriting fee.

[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:26.180]
Zero dock fees.

[01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:27.900]
Zero prepayment penalty.

Live off in wonder who will throw you in.

[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.560]
Some palm beach people went to do their voting chore.

[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:42.700]
So count up all the ballots and find out who's got more.

[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:48.700]
Those old folks seem to have one thing in common.

[01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:52.060]
Looks like lots of them just keep their votes too.

[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:53.540]
Patrick, you can.

[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:55.760]

[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:46.680]

[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:46.680]

[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:46.680]

[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:46.680]

[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:46.820]
I'm going to get the votes.

[01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:46.820]

[01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:46.820]

I'm going to get the votes.

That's an election.

[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:54.720]
Well, who won the election?

[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.860]
Since that's a little tutorials, today you've got lots of chances.

[01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:14.300]
But how about you, get the votes, down theway.

[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:18.620]
We'll have 2 moreыхks over here.

[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:20.100]
I'm in it for Bush

[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:22.140]
Count the vote. I'm in it for God

[01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:23.140]
Fuck third man

[01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:24.480]
I'm in it for Bush

[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.420]

Count the vote. Demand steps of added

[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:34.540]
That 18 and 560 WQM. I finally took me three years to figure it out. You know that judge

[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:37.980]
I was talking about in Palm Beach that kept looking up. We saw him all over the world on TV. Right?

[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:42.800]
It's big eyeball look like I was in her like pop right out of the socket. Mm-hmm. Finally figured it out

[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:47.880]
That's why I played that before. You're looking for glory holes. Yeah. That's what he was looking for. Gory holes

[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:54.140]
Anyway, 171 votes. What's your take on Al Gore's endorsement of Howard Dean? You can tell us audiences on fire. Oh

[01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:55.180]
About it not

[01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:02.260]
It'll help Dean a lot 73. It'll make no difference 41. I don't care. I'm for Bush 26 15.2 percent

[01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:06.100]
Which makes me want to barf makes me want to squat on the floor and drop a big number

[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:10.900]
A guarantee's been nomination for Dean 21 and it'll actually hurt Dean 10

[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:14.980]
5.8% of the system's student audience says it'll actually hurt Dean

[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:16.980]
Oh, oh, right

[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:23.720]
Just like those union endorsements probably hurt him too, which is why he jumped from 17% in the November pool or October to

[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:25.620]
25% of the current one latest one

[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:30.640]
Or they just flashed on the screen again on CNN 25% Clarks got 17

[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:32.300]
Lieberman's got 10 oh

[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:41.640]
And the latest presidential pool Dean the bad wagon is rolling baby and he ain't no Michael Ducaca. No, he no water mind. They'll he ain't no band leader right

[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:45.060]
Michael Jackson by the way who ain't no singer

[01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:53.200]
New document made back Jackson's defense. You know, this is ABC news the boy legend Michael Jackson molested him told child where well for officials in February

[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:56.900]
The entertainer never abused him according to a documented taint by the smoking gun

[01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:02.100]
The confidential memo on the police and child welfare investigation conducted in LA

[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:06.780]
The proved damaging of the case against Jackson in Santa Barbara County. Wow. This goes I didn't want to read this

[01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:09.640]
We already this was about the tape and all this other stuff

[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:14.440]
He was covering his ass back in February when he started making rumblings that the Schmidt was gonna hit the fan

[01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:17.900]
Catch my drift. I caught it

[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:24.520]
In fact Howard Stern said the Schmidt already hit the fan. It's on in the morning between six and nine or ten matterly goes off

[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.580]
Uh, anyway more on this social workers want to interview Michael Jackson's children

[01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:33.140]
But have been stymied each time they visited Neverland Ranch sources told the New York Post yesterday

[01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:39.760]
The child welfare investigators have been seeking a sit down with the kids ever since the self-style king of plot was busted in November 18

[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:45.300]
For allegedly molesting a 12-year-old cancer survivor at the ranch social workers have played about a half a dozen visits to Neverland

[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:48.060]
But each time nobody's been at home except Teresa and they said okay

[01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:51.000]
We'll take your kid because Rebecca and this really pissed off

[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:58.460]
And when or you don't watch your passions you know what's going on? They're taking away a Teresa's baby. Oh

[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:02.960]
They're baby everybody and chose got a baby even. I think Julian's got a baby

[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:07.040]
Jackson has not been seen in public since the memory teen and so on

[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:11.200]
L.A. Defense lawyer Steve Cron said he's not surprised the authorities want to check up on the kids

[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:18.900]
You don't need to be convicted of anything to be investigated said Cron lawyer for comic Paula poundstone who lost her kids for a year due to child endangerment charges

[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:26.700]
And it goes on about the fact he's got the two sons prince Michael one and two and a daughter Paris and everybody wonders

[01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:37.000]
Who the real father was and is he gonna hang him over to balcony again or what are they hung? Oh

[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.660]
Marles line. I want to see some enthusiasm. I'll play that old-gore thing again. I'll tell you right now

[01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:43.660]
Yeah, that's no it was good if we know you there's not one line flashing

[01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:49.020]
We're doing screenless this month out of the holidays out of respect for the fact it's the holidays a big screenless month

[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:55.720]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Marles not that I don't have a real pile here man

[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:58.260]
I got wild piles like you wouldn't believe

[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:03.040]
Which is like what led me to my little incident I had on this during the show yesterday

[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:06.980]
Yeah, we forgot to talk about it. Oh, okay, too embarrassing you could play turtleneck

[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:08.500]
I

[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:11.260]
Was doing that right in the chair yesterday with myself

[01:52:12.420 --> 01:52:13.240]
WQ I am

[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:17.140]
Hey, Neil. How are you pretty good great? You're the best listen

[01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:23.940]
I think that the mothers of all of all of Michael Jackson supposed to children should be arrested for child endangerment

[01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:25.160]
Yeah, that's right, you know

[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:28.420]
They don't even know where one of them came from to him or that nurse and then the other one

[01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:31.980]
They just appeared somewhere like you just got it somewhere. Yeah, just popped up

[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:35.840]
Another kid he's always having something pop up in his bed

[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:39.600]
Yeah, no pun intended my magic mushrooms

[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:43.140]

[01:52:56.680 --> 01:52:57.620]

[01:52:57.620 --> 01:52:59.140]
Yeah, oh

[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:03.620]
Okay, you're out all right. I've seen some pretty hot people on blind date as matter of fact

[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:06.400]
I'm not not that I would admit to watching it

[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:10.540]
But I've seen some pretty hot people on there. No, it's it's hit or miss sometimes it's

[01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:16.280]
That's the way it is now with your 60,000 channels on your cable with everybody in the world and your 45 satellite

[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:21.120]
This is if you got them uh you flip you keep flipping it and flipping it and flipping it in a channel two

[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:23.520]
And when you find somebody or something that looks pretty good

[01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:26.200]
Then that's where the it's slipping stops then you rest

[01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:28.680]
And all know then you the real flipping starts

[01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:32.280]
You know what I'm saying? She wasn't a girl. I don't call it. Oh

[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:51.300]
You lost touch with ramp. Oh, nobody's on hold either

[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:55.520]
What is it nobody's on hold so if we have to dump something inside just right

[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:57.180]
Well, then they wouldn't enjoy it though. That's right

Some toys

[01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:21.060]
You think they'll accept if Michael Jackson was involved they probably accept sex toys right with things so

[01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:25.460]
Fisher press and a good news in case you tune it later Scott for all looks like his middle-anon is feeding

[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:26.040]
Chicago

[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:29.360]
Anemone show whenever good absolutely

[01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:35.880]
And it probably do pretty well. Let's see here's the facts from Kathy and dear field left-handed to whatever it says

[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:40.960]
Howard Dean is going to be miming this Saturday the fundraiser is 50 bucks and you can go to dean for america

[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:46.580]
Slice blues and click on Kathy linkus which is her and LiNKO U.S.

[01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:49.260]
To be counted under my invitation

[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:54.420]
What does that mean I don't know come on the old car come with you. It's only 50 bucks

[01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:57.720]
Well, I don't think I'm going to fly all the way from Toronto to Miami to go see Howard Dean

[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:01.400]
In fact, I just saw my my TV for a few little while ago, but that's okay

[01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:04.440]
Kathy is and it's not enough

[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:09.240]
I guess that I'm like pumping her thing here and pumping her but she also wants the 50 bucks in the answer is no

[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:16.000]
Bearest for that George will come through for you. That's what we don't think that we can't do a Joshua less than to the 50

[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:18.280]
Small change

[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:23.120]
Wait till you hear this sports fans city looks to get drugs via Canada

[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:25.240]
See the the American

[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:33.480]
Establishment the fascist establishment including the DEA and the FDA. Oh no, no, no, you can't take those drugs because they're gonna kill you

[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:37.880]
All the other people I see except the ones that made that one guy that was in the a theater yesterday

[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:42.180]
Unfortunately here in Toronto everybody else is like walking around okay. They're taking their popping

[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:45.000]
Fulls paradise there about the drug

[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.980]
Beginning next July Boston the city of Boston plans to import prescription drugs from Canada sources

[01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:52.520]
The Boston Globe this morning for thousands of

[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:57.580]
City workers and retirees under a cost saving proposal mayor Thomas Minno is announcing today

[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:02.740]
The pilot program outlined in remarks scheduled to be delivered to the city council hearing will probably save

[01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:07.660]
Shave about a million dollars a year off the city 61 million dollar prescription drug bill according to city estimates

[01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:12.400]
The savings are expected to be relatively small at first because the program would be voluntary and cover a limited

[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.440]
So much of medicines like oxy cotton maybe

[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:17.380]
Minino

[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:22.980]
Search in his comments which were obtained by the globe that importing medications is safe although the federal food and drug

[01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:28.660]
Administration is repeatedly cautioned it can ensure the safety of drugs brought in from Canada and importation remains illegal

[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:33.020]
I can't ensure the safety of drugs brought in from Canada because this is a 10th world country

[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:37.860]
Because everything here is dangerous and my career and if he didn't be Donald's here got only nose more kind of meat they're using

[01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:42.040]
God what so sad it's so sad

[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:47.020]
They want everybody in America to continue to be like a five-year-old kid in the sandbox

[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:51.680]
With his little pale in shovel and believe me they keep giving you plenty of shovel in there

[01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:53.300]
And smell it

[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:56.620]
So that's good Boston is like standing up to him excellent

[01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:41.180]

[01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:49.460]

[01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:53.380]

All the race is always free and with thousands and zillions of suits and stock up to size 70

[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:06.720]

The radio's all yours now

[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:29.360]
Q.A.M

[01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:32.280]
I like you a lot

[01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:36.460]
Unmistakably this is television at its best. Yes over here. Yes

[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:42.180]
Well, I don't think this is a really governance issue

[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:45.580]
Bigger

[01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:48.200]
I hate to do it

[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:49.560]
Okay

[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:57.140]
Along I cannot lift it but together we can

[01:58:57.140 --> 01:59:04.080]
This has been a presentation of ABC news property 205 60 WDQM now I'm gonna tell you one of the reasons that newspapers suck

[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:09.540]
Okay, we do get a lot of very good information about new from newspapers like I'm looking at a sunset little

[01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:11.620]
website right now breaking news

[01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:14.980]
Dal rallies crosses 10,000 for the first time in 18 months

[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:17.940]
The only problem is like fall in bank

[01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:23.320]
9967.23 it's up a paukey 2.96 points

[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:29.460]
Not that I'm wishing any of you investors any ill just because misery loves company and mishersh is a piece of crap

[01:59:29.460 --> 01:59:30.960]
But anyway, it's like

[01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:35.680]
Like two and a half points and sliding back the next down 14 and a half

[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:40.620]
So when they put that headline on their own website. Yeah, it did cross like temporarily for like a millisecond

[01:59:40.620 --> 01:59:41.800]
And then all of a sudden

[01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:43.240]
right back down

[01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:47.620]
They don't want to get a little bit too carried away because everybody's working and speaking to that

[01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:51.380]
I got a great story on our website today and the arranges calm that you all should read

[01:59:51.380 --> 01:59:57.860]
It's too long to read on ear although Georgia be depressed and I won't too long. Oh well wall mart's big squeeze play by Harley-Sorinson

[01:59:59.540 --> 02:00:05.740]
Starts out by saying question when is big too big answer when it's wall mart. Yeah, that I just read a couple of

[02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:08.820]
Programs to what your whistle our reading read it on the website what it

[02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:12.160]
She says about 50 years ago when I lived in Seattle and worked at Boeing

[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:18.400]
I stumbled one day upon a Luther League forum debating this question is it possible to succeed in business using Christian ethics

[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:23.080]
We didn't have rabid liberals and rabid conservatives in those days released not many of them

[02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:26.100]
So most of the people involved in the forum or what we now call middle of the road

[02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:29.060]
The conclusion they reach at the end of the hour was a well full

[02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:30.020]
No

[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:33.520]
Nobody wanted to admit that the golden rule was not a good business rule

[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:37.040]
But facts is facts and the forum was an honest one which brings us to wall mart

[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:39.060]
To the best of my knowledge

[02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:43.360]
Sam Walton didn't break any laws building his fantastic wall mart empire in his low-priced philosophy

[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:44.340]
Certain helped a lot of people

[02:00:44.340 --> 02:00:48.280]
But Walton's success was ruthlessly created on the backs of fragile human beings

[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:50.540]
Well good many of whom are worse off for the experience

[02:00:50.540 --> 02:00:54.300]
So on balance his wall mart more good than bad or more bad than good

[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.880]
And you can guess for yourself what the conclusion of this article is and it goes on and on a fairly great length

[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:03.680]
It's on our website neo-riders.com along with a lot of other good stuff that you should be reading

[02:01:04.140 --> 02:01:05.380]
And not enough people are

[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:12.920]
See we we I think what we need to do is like take out a maybe I'll pay for it a full page ad in the USA today or something like that

[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:15.000]
Yeah, and just promote our website

[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:18.720]
Okay, and then a lot of people could like listen to the show online

[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:22.980]
Right right, but most importantly they could find one spot

[02:01:22.980 --> 02:01:27.080]
I mean, I'm not saying that they can't find all these stories someplace else because needless to say would a fast

[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:28.960]
News resources of P.I.N.

[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:31.160]
We sure is hard dig these things up on our own

[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:35.280]
But it's just to me it's like a like a godsend you know from

[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:39.720]
The price is right and it saves you a hell of a lot of time from reading sifting through like

[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:46.720]
Hundreds and hundreds of newspapers and 85,000 the website's every day, right? Right. I think we're doing it and you don't get ink on your fingers

[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:47.820]
That's correct

[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:53.020]
Sometimes you get stink on your finger, but that's when you're a bad boy or good

[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:56.820]
5 6 7 0 5 60 well, that's what scurran said

[02:01:56.820 --> 02:02:00.640]
How's that book doing one in the pink and one in the stink? I'm just thinking about writing it

[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:05.520]
She's getting so much feedback from that. Yes, you really yeah almost as good as my best of meals book

[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:07.460]
How I attack the buffet

[02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:11.220]
Fies it look at that phone man. Is that week or what see what I'm saying

[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:14.280]
On a day when we started out with at the go announcement

[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:16.500]
Just for this audience

[02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:24.760]
You think that the audience to be all pumped up and foaming it to mouth. They're not too busy shopping

[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:30.380]
They can't be bothered with us line one is working again. Is it ringing no? Oh, yeah, it is now

[02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:31.660]
W.D. Q.A.M. line one

Okay, yeah, I know you're an asshole

[02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:36.860]
W.D. Q.A.M

[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:40.420]
Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, hi

[02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:46.420]
I wanted to call about having you play that Miami Dolphin fight song again. That's great stuff, man

[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:53.540]
Okay, it's great stuff. I'm not a dolphin fan. I assume that I know not what you like. I like jets

[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:54.780]
The jets well

[02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:02.460]
Nothing's perfect, but I will say this because I can relate the the next best thing that the jets winning in your case

[02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:04.160]
Would be the dolphins losing there you go

[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:09.100]
In fact, I feel the same way if the Patriots can't win them all at least if they're dolphins lose it makes my day a lot better

[02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:13.460]
There you go have a great day pal. I do and you got it. Yeah, don't let me forget to play that

[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:19.680]
Don't forget you think you know what else I got to play again. Oh, I should be playing it every hour on the hour. I should show you

[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:29.740]
That the Mickey Mouse thing and Remus remus is my favorite Mickey's okay, but Remus is just he's just there's something special

[02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:32.480]
He's the bomb diggery he beat a bomb he to man

[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:36.000]
Speaking of he to man stunt woman to sue Schwarzenegger

[02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:38.780]
Arnold we just heard about what is a stunt penis

[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:45.400]
Arnold Schwarzenegger is being sued by a woman who claims he launched a dirty turt scampaign against her on the eve of his election is

[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:47.040]
California governor it emerged today

[02:03:48.620 --> 02:03:53.020]
stunt woman Ron de Miller was one of a number of women who claimed to have been groped by the actor turned politician

[02:03:53.020 --> 02:03:55.620]
But the day before Californians went to the polls

[02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:58.780]
Schwarzenegger's office allegedly issued an advisory to the media

[02:03:58.780 --> 02:04:04.440]
Detailing information about a convicted criminal called Ron de Miller with an hours miss Miller was branded a criminal on news programs

[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:09.560]
Only days after the election with Schwarzenegger victorious that it emerged that miss Miller had no criminal record

[02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:14.000]
The information alluded to by the Schwarzenegger campaign team and carried on by law enforcement

[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:19.120]
Carried on the law enforcement website was about a different woman with the same name. How do you like that?

[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:21.640]
There must have been just an accident don't you think? I'm sure

[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:28.000]
Gloria all read the anxious Gloria all read a California attorney who appeared alongside miss Miller when she made her groping claims

[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.520]
Was holding a press conference today to announce the lawsuit

[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:37.620]
At the briefing she'll announce a fire. I wonder if it's an after not. I'll be where she'll announce a filing of libel lawsuit against governor

[02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:40.660]
Schwarzenegger in his campaign committee office it cuz it's only 9 30 out there

[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:45.800]
She said in a statement on October 6, 2003. Miss Miller held a news conference with Miss all red and which Miss Miller

[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:50.020]
She had been sexually harassed by mr. Schwarzenegger when she worked as a stunt woman in a movie with him

[02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:54.500]
Shortly after the news conference today the Schwarzenegger campaign sent email to reporters

[02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:59.840]
Which appeared to suggest that miss Miller was a convicted felon always attacked a bitch. Okay always attack the victim

[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:01.940]
Whether it's Kobe whether it's uh

[02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:07.840]
Anybody right right right works like a charm always attacked a victim just like a Robert Blake your buddy there

[02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:10.880]
Mm-hmm. She had it coming just like oh Jay the bitch had it coming

[02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:16.440]
The truth was however that the Ron de Memorow held the news conference with Miss all red had never been arrested for anything in her life

[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:20.320]
The false information about Miss all red time was broadcast on national television

[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:23.280]
No comment was immediately available from Schwarzenegger

[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:27.620]
He's still looking for the uh he's looking for the groper the a fear and groper

[02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:32.040]
They could open fear. He's still looking for him. I guess he didn't shave today

[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:37.800]
Just looking to Mayor Arnold. I mean what what what what kind of crap in the news media they reported with a straight face after

[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:40.580]
After the election is over then he's gonna conduct his own investigation

[02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:42.600]
Right

[02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:48.760]
What does that mean is he gonna like subject himself to truth serum or something like that means uh shut up

[02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:50.500]
Hook himself up to a lie detector

[02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:55.040]
Did I really grope them or not now that I was engaged in some rowdy behavior by the set of movies

[02:05:55.780 --> 02:05:59.180]
Let me tell you right now boys and girls that was today if you're any doubts

[02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:01.300]
That was the day the final nail went in the American coffee

[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:07.900]
48% in california and such a liberal supposed state broad-minded progressive thinking and breathing

[02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:10.640]
Just because they wanted to say goodbye to a great Davis

[02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:14.120]
And so the octoman who is just

[02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:19.040]
I'm believably functionally illiterate. He sounds like he just got off the guy to have banana boat

[02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:21.560]
The kill the uh bratwurst boat

[02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:24.180]
Man how long has he been here how many years?

[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:26.560]
You can't speak for the crap

[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:31.660]
1240 20-20-101 you know what that makes me want to uh play I give up

[02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:34.260]
Why haven't played it in a long time

[02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:37.160]
Not playing enough

[02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:44.380]
See makes me want to inspire me well get them all in it's a good time for the great taste

[02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:49.100]
Speaking of that how about a segue for balance for life, huh?

[02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:53.280]
Katrina's lost about 10 and a half pounds and probably more than that if we seen her at all this week or not

[02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:55.380]
Well yesterday and she said

[02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:57.600]
taking half pounds 10 and a half pounds not bad

[02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:02.880]
She's only been on a couple of weeks. I think since the remember 17 less than a month. What is that 24 like two and a half weeks

[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:08.020]
Balance for life is easy you try the others and one of the reasons that it's so difficult to stay on him is because number one

[02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:13.500]
Lot of marboring number two the food is crappy and those pre-fab uh jobs like a Jenny Craig and uh

[02:07:13.500 --> 02:07:18.520]
Weight watchers and some of those and number three who now can count all the calories in the carbs who can do that

[02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:21.860]
I'll tell you can do it the people that balance for life they do it for you

[02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:28.060]
And that's why they put together fantastic food five feeding today three gourmet meals two delicious snacks are in your black sack

[02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:33.180]
How do you do is reach outside the door every morning by six a.m. It's there and then you just mongi mongi all day long

[02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:37.160]
It's plenty of food to keep you happy and satisfied throughout the day so you don't cheat that's the secret

[02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:44.420]
And nothing is frozen or pre-fab everything is fresh and delicious and you get to choose between two choices for each meal and snack every day

[02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:47.100]
That is your own program balance for life of the only folks unless you do that

[02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:51.020]
So if you really finally once and for all want to try something that can work the delicious way

You a.m

[02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:37.200]
All right, Miami has the dolphins there the worst football team

[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:41.440]
They plug the ball from goal to goal like no one's ever seen

[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:46.100]
There on the ground that's where they'll stay. They're never in control

[02:08:46.100 --> 02:08:53.260]
No, and when you say Miami you're talking toilet holders there the Miami dolphins

[02:08:53.940 --> 02:08:55.440]
Miami dolphins

[02:08:56.180 --> 02:08:59.600]
Miami dolphins number how many teams in the league

[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:02.260]
Miami dolphins

[02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:04.480]
Miami dolphins

[02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:07.140]
Don't bet on them you'll always lose

[02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:15.260]
They don't know how to tackle they don't know how to block

[02:09:15.260 --> 02:09:19.900]
Their coaches ought to tell them to put the day in their jocks

[02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:24.200]
Then they would run much faster and even in defeat

[02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:28.180]
When we go to the stadium we'll see Miami

[02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:31.380]
And they're the Miami dolphins

[02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:33.680]
Miami dolphins

[02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:37.600]
Miami dolphins number how many teams in the league?

[02:09:37.620 --> 02:09:40.440]
Well, good man. Miami dolphins

[02:09:41.180 --> 02:09:42.680]
Miami dolphins

[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:45.320]
The team that hasn't got a clue

[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:58.000]
Miami has the dolphins but the dolphins have no fans just 50,000 assholes sitting in the stand

[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.440]
Let them they watch the game and all they do is moan in gripe and bitch

[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:09.700]
I wonder how joe robby got to be so goddamn rich and they're the Miami dolphins

[02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:11.800]
Miami dolphins

[02:10:12.580 --> 02:10:15.920]
Miami dolphins number how many teams in the league?

[02:10:16.020 --> 02:10:16.780]

Miami dolphins

[02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:20.880]
Miami dolphins

[02:10:21.540 --> 02:10:23.880]
I hear the crowd begin to boo

[02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:31.760]
The dolphins have faith feedler that quarter backs at you

[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:36.200]
Run down the field and he will throw a pass over you

[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:40.640]
Oh, I'll never win a super bowl you shouldn't be surprised

[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:47.840]
When he gets cut that doesn't mean that he was circumcised and there the Miami dolphins

[02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:50.020]
Miami dolphins

[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:53.980]
Miami dolphins number how many teams in the league?

[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:54.900]
Fuck food man!

[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:56.880]
Miami dolphins

[02:10:57.480 --> 02:10:59.080]
Miami dolphins

[02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:02.020]
Jake calls his signals in Hebrew

[02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:09.920]
The dolphins have no defense and their offense is a joke

[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:14.500]
Like George Bush eating pretzels you know they're gonna choke

[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:19.000]
They'll always disappoint you when they're in a playoff race

[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:24.160]
With fewer points than parkmarks on high zingas ugly face and they're the

[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:26.060]
Miami dolphins

[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:28.320]
Miami dolphins

[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:32.820]
Miami dolphins number oh what the hell 32

[02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:35.060]
Miami dolphins

[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:37.380]
Miami dolphins

[02:11:39.540 --> 02:11:43.620]
Miami dolphins now they're through

[02:11:43.620 --> 02:11:44.180]
Yeah

[02:11:46.620 --> 02:11:49.360]
I tell you one thing next one it could be really you believe me

[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:51.560]
I can't imagine if anybody was really you believe it's me

[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:55.520]
1248 at 560 and just like I said but Arnold

[02:11:56.120 --> 02:11:59.240]
Good timing whoever fax this in thank you so many very much

[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:03.440]
From the Mercury News Sacramento Bureau just weeks after following to investigate

[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:05.400]
allegations of sexual harassment against him

[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:09.340]
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has changed his mind saying it's time to move on

[02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:15.040]
At least OJ he's still looking for him killers on a golf course

[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:20.180]
But Arnold he don't have time now he's busy being governor of California so it's time to move on

[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:25.100]
More than a dozen allegations of harassment and groping surface against the movie stature and

[02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:27.020]
Politician in the last days of the recall campaign

[02:12:27.020 --> 02:12:31.260]
Prompting Schwarzenegger to acknowledge that he had sometimes behaved badly on rowdy movie sets

[02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:36.340]
He apologized to anyone he may have offended a me of culpice communication director reiterated yesterday

[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:41.800]
The governor after consulting with legal counsel and advisors has determined that investigation will be rather pointless

[02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:47.120]
Given the political nature this is taken on said Rob Stutzman Schwarzenegger's communications director

[02:12:47.660 --> 02:12:52.680]
The LA District Attorney's Office said it has no investigation no complain on which to act and so the governor is concluded

[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:57.760]
As we believe most Californians have it simply time to move on so we can focus entirely on the job

[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:01.820]
Californians in here to do he remains sincere in his apology to anyone he's offended

[02:13:01.820 --> 02:13:04.700]
Right that's what that bunny would have said if he had the chance

[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:07.280]
Right apologize

[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:12.640]
Let's move on. So what's your auntie Tom? In fact, I think that's what what's his name is?

[02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:17.560]
Rodriguez guys are going to say to a time to move on. I apologize and let's move on and who's got the burritos

[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:22.600]
Attorney general Bill Lockyer who's urged Schwarzenegger to hire a firm to investigate the claims had no

[02:13:22.600 --> 02:13:26.980]
Comment yesterday his press said his press secretary Halle Jordan no keen to Halle Berry

[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:30.760]
I forgot that Halle Berry had that nasty a merits that they've just us

[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:37.800]
They didn't a real bitter nasty hostile miserable divorce and her thinking about committing suicide. You know that? No

[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:38.560]
Yeah

[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:45.080]
lawyer gargloria all-read who represents a woman who and you notice one thing about then they're both exactly the same complexion

[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:48.140]
Because she's got a white mother and a dark-complexed father

[02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:51.000]
And he said something about your mama they've just us

[02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:55.100]
lawyer Gloria all-read both she's just everywhere who represented well

[02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:59.820]
It's the same story urged the woman to sue shorts when I was shorts and I said the governor's decision was not surprising

[02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:02.140]
But it's insufficient in sufficient

[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:07.660]
The issue was not going to go away any attempt to cover it up or run from it's going to be seen for exactly what it is

[02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:12.520]
She said he needs to be accountable already democratic activists who donated to former governor great Davis's campaign

[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:18.180]
Suggested that Schwarzenegger should set an example by holding a public forum so women could air their grievances

[02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:23.940]
The governor's about face may create a perception problem for his pledging administration said Joe Sarell

[02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:28.600]
If I'm a democratic consultant a lot of people will just laugh because they didn't think it was going to happen to begin with

[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:31.320]
This is underscoring what people anticipated right?

[02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:32.880]
Rucket right

[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:37.520]
We knew it. I mean how how any ought to give you got to be well

[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:41.000]
I'll investigate it after it likes the whole idea of the allegations were to prove how unfit

[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:46.020]
He was to be the governor well to scumbag he is but he's going to investigate his own actions after he gets in there

[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:49.060]
And the public said yeah, sure

[02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:53.220]
Man talk about stupid stupid idiotic jerks

[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:58.960]
We're in the wrong business. Oh, we ought to be we ought to be selling snake oil out there in a highway make a fortune

[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:06.460]
I'm telling you there's something five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T line two hundred and fifty votes on a pool on the

[02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:10.200]
Arjun's dot com. I thought that this pulpit explode. Didn't you?

[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:12.240]
My god

[02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:17.020]
Major major development in the presidential they just don't care they give them up

[02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:20.800]
They're waiting for the ball games like the guy wants you the dolphin. Can you imagine that I played it?

[02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:28.600]
254 votes what you're taking out wars endorsement of Howard Dean it'll help Dean a lot one oh nine

[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:37.780]
It'll make no difference 57. I don't care. I'm for Bush 43 16.9 percent. There is that usual stubborn 17 or 18 percent

[02:15:38.340 --> 02:15:40.720]
That I'm always telling you about constant never changes

[02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:44.820]
Even with Lordass on the year right now popping those oxies

[02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:48.800]
If guaranteed the nomination for Dean look how many people said that

[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:55.760]
And it'll actually hurt Dean 15 silly people 5.9 percent out of 254 said actually hurt Dean that go endorsement

[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:55.120]
All right, let me ask you a question. Yes, has it been your experience that guys with net worth like this are pretty smart guys

[02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:04.520]
Do you mean like sliced along? Well, yeah, I mean anybody that basically came from nothing and to create a

Like some tremendous ingenuity

[02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:21.720]
He was a muscle bound freak

[02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:24.180]
Well, but he's elevated himself

[02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:28.760]
Yeah, what do you try to tell me sir that he's a genius?

[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:35.940]
Now what I'm what I'm trying to tell you is that he is also surrounded himself with some very smart business people

[02:26:36.500 --> 02:26:42.000]
Dangerous people like George Schultz that's correct good points are dangerous five six seven oh five sixty pound five

Right that's right. She she's tired. Well, of course she took somebody else's money and then she made a fortune with them

[02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:06.680]
But what can I tell you?

[02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:10.100]

Just one of them things. I just made enough of a contribution in fact

[02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:52.580]
I think they built two of the new casinos with my contribution and I hope they have a good time. It's fine

[02:28:53.340 --> 02:28:58.580]
In fact, it's so much fun that even the the suicide hijackers went there. They were having like meetings in Vegas

[02:28:58.580 --> 02:29:00.060]
What about the hypocrites, huh?

[02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:02.460]

[02:29:03.420 --> 02:29:06.220]
Vegas and I don't know if they were gambling out there what they were doing, but I'm sure they I mean

[02:29:06.220 --> 02:29:09.500]
I just don't get it of course the fact is little bit when you're dealing with crazy people

[02:29:09.500 --> 02:29:12.700]
They'll try to rationalize. Oh, let's see what they were about to do would make up for all that

[02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:14.740]

I was surprised Lieberman acknowledged in an actually broadcast interview

[02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:39.600]
But he said I'm more determined than ever to fight for what I believe is right for my party in my country in other words far right

I did what I thought was right. I couldn't run against the guy who gave me a chance to run for vice president

[02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:12.980]
Lieberman spoke a little over an hour before Gore appearing with Dean in Harlem formally announced he was supporting the Vermont governor

[02:36:12.980 --> 02:36:20.320]

Joe had the smallest quietest most insignificant following you've ever wanted to see right even from the blue hairs from Palm Beach for Joe

[02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:57.900]
Oi well that reminds me of an article we had on about a month or two ago about the

Chicago or the Joe Lieberman fan club or whatever they were calling it and it was like a website had like eight members nation wide

Carrey followed by Clark and then Dean and just being amongst

Some civilized people is uh the glimmer of both was glimmering and I think actually there's no way the people who

[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:40.720]
Might say that Gore would hurt they weren't gonna vote for Dean anyway, right? I don't think I think he could only help

[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:46.580]
How could it not exactly he gave him like a fantastic send-off man right on

[02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:00.460]
So anyway, here's Kathy's facts again so she didn't get all bent out of shape and we got plenty of time

[02:40:00.460 --> 02:40:03.060]
All week long to promote it Howard Dean will be in Miami this Saturday

[02:40:03.060 --> 02:40:07.120]
He will not be appearing at no Jewish jellies like Wesley Clark though. I don't think do you?

[02:40:08.180 --> 02:40:11.020]
I'm not prepared for the rascal house to daily than any of these things

[02:40:11.020 --> 02:40:15.060]
Uh, what I still don't care what that's all about. I guess he's trying to appear to the old Jews

[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:21.420]
West Park the fundraiser is 50 bucks and you can go to this website dean for America's last blues

[02:40:22.900 --> 02:40:25.640]
Okay, and click on Kathy linkus

[02:40:28.340 --> 02:40:28.740]
Linkus

[02:40:28.740 --> 02:40:35.960]
I wonder for a grandfather's name was pinkus Kathy linkus to be counted under her invitation

[02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:38.880]
And then Kathy goes on to say

[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:44.780]
What does that mean? I'm promoting it for a Kathy back off on a long

[02:40:44.780 --> 02:40:45.940]
If I don't read it again

[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:51.280]
Not that I wouldn't donate to 50 bucks for Dean for the cause, but I ain't gonna be there. Okay, Kathy you got it

[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:55.580]
Plus we don't get any women call us on the screen. So we don't have to beg for many more right? What's the point?

[02:40:55.980 --> 02:41:00.680]
We have one noble moment at silly thing that silly spy report see what I when I get out of that kind of stuff

[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:05.480]
It's like overgrown children, you know, yeah, it's like a throwback to that old time that topical talk

[02:41:05.480 --> 02:41:12.280]
Well, you know, Alan Burke said this about you and the David Gold said this about mr. Ego, you know, it's so freaking childish

[02:41:13.060 --> 02:41:18.600]
So what did most say? I don't know five six seven. I don't know because we know listen. Does anybody else listen? No now

[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:20.520]
And how can he not have any material?

[02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:25.520]
My god, he just hasn't caught on yet the town loves after a loss

[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:32.440]
That's when they like moaning and groaning and bitching and carrying on and hoping that the coach gets fired in like a burn on a stake

[02:41:34.300 --> 02:41:35.180]
WQ I am

[02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:38.120]
Yes, sir shot no

[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:43.640]

[02:41:44.540 --> 02:41:46.780]
Yes, I did well congratulations sucker

[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:48.500]

[02:41:48.500 --> 02:41:51.680]
Don't have no flu. Okay. I'm not gonna get flu or stars or many of these things

[02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:53.860]
I'm as healthy as a horse. How do you like that? That's what they said?

[02:41:54.000 --> 02:42:00.240]
I'm ananza that old fart is as healthy as a horse by the way, Hoss is dead. Yeah, he is WQ I am hello

[02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:02.380]
Hey, you know how you been on pretty good

[02:42:02.940 --> 02:42:05.000]
Can I ask you a question about your radio?

[02:42:05.580 --> 02:42:10.780]
I think it's not the first time about a radio station about your radio station go ahead

[02:42:11.620 --> 02:42:13.600]
Um, like with our David

[02:42:14.300 --> 02:42:14.680]
um

[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:19.240]
It's a radio station doesn't renew his contract

[02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:26.220]
So he get pulled off the the dolphin broadcast and did the dolphin first of all he's got two more years on his contract

[02:42:26.220 --> 02:42:30.720]
That's number one and there are two is dolphin contracts completely separate. It's a separate deal

[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:31.800]
Oh

[02:42:38.500 --> 02:42:43.340]
5605 60 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:47.660]
OJ feet will be long gone two years. You can make he'll move around no more

[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:52.000]
Won't see him no more. I hate to break the news you have to fight a new boyfriend a couple of years

[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:56.680]
Most because there won't be no j feetler. No chance long gone

[02:42:57.300 --> 02:43:02.120]
What even taking the CFL? Don't see him no more even George knows that

[02:43:04.180 --> 02:43:04.980]
WQ I am

[02:43:06.060 --> 02:43:07.740]
No, Mo no, Mo

[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:09.760]
Oh

[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:16.300]
Let's see what he's supposed to sing is no mo homo. That's what he's supposed to be sing. He just don't get it

[02:43:16.660 --> 02:43:19.100]
Don't you love the way the see the guy already called it

[02:43:19.100 --> 02:43:23.420]
I always love that you know, but evidently he was so impressed by what he heard just before was so much

[02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:24.740]
Obviously better than his material

[02:43:24.740 --> 02:43:27.960]
He just did the old pair of routine which we like wanted to do an echo

[02:43:27.960 --> 02:43:33.620]
I can't 26 past one the mad dog come up at two with more excuses more alibis more

[02:43:34.140 --> 02:43:36.700]
You know that stuff which we love mad dog doesn't matter in anybody

[02:44:06.700 --> 02:44:08.300]
He's got a big hole in it and his head too

[02:44:09.060 --> 02:44:13.220]
Everybody gets that ball spot sooner or later and if you don't want to walk around looking like your hair is in the sink

[02:44:13.220 --> 02:44:16.140]
Or in the turliter somewhere on the ground and you'd like to have a full head of hair

[02:44:16.140 --> 02:44:20.440]
So you get like maybe a head in life or like a little head Charles off here is the guy you want to talk to

[02:44:21.240 --> 02:44:24.480]
Everybody in their brother now it seems like especially on his radio station

[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:28.280]
We hear about 50 million different spots every day this one's spending of this system

[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:32.180]
And this one wants you to put the holes in the head with the blood dripping down your forehead forget about that

[02:44:32.180 --> 02:44:36.640]
The only thing that really works is the natural hairline system because the key is does it look like we

[02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:43.400]
You'll hear any answer is yes, it does like it's going out of your scalp as opposed to that barnyard animal that crawled up on your head and died a wicked death

[02:44:43.400 --> 02:44:48.520]
And you have nothing loose but your shiny bald spot because like I always tell you everybody gets Charlie's 30 day

[02:44:50.060 --> 02:44:53.760]
Guarantee if you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells after 30 days if you're not getting more action

[02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:58.340]
Then you ever dreamed in your life then just a return it for a four-week fun and get your money back and speaking of cash

[02:44:58.340 --> 02:45:03.800]
Mission the arises when you call get extra two-and-a-bucks off the already reasonable press at Charlie's natural hairline system

[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:07.980]
So it's up to you guys if you watch your hair back and looking great and younger than you ever dreamed you could again

[02:45:07.980 --> 02:45:11.680]
This is the smart way to do it called Charles apherean for Lauderdale toll free

[02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:14.540]

[02:45:33.600 --> 02:45:37.440]
It's not pronounced Chanaka what kind of crazy pitchfork is that?

[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:47.380]
I'm not a pitchfork you put Charlie Brown. That's a menorah. Oh, hey, you'll love all the peanuts characters in this soon to be Jewish holiday classic

[02:45:47.380 --> 02:45:54.360]
I play with your dreidel only if I can have a bite of your kiss cup. I just don't understand all of this talk about Chanaka

[02:45:54.360 --> 02:46:01.140]
Oh, hey Charlie Brown, not about Chanaka, it's Hanaka sponsored in part by Goldberg's fake good. Oh

Uh, the best in the LCD 2003 2004 and also of course the world famous everybody's got to have one of these so that when we bury him

[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:29.940]
It might be worth something the more hard-divided keychain and we got the mugs and all kinds of good crap on our website

[02:46:29.940 --> 02:46:34.500]
But anyway, we'll have a van hit with Scotch Jr tomorrow. It'll be it'll be a who just to go out and take a look at him

[02:46:34.500 --> 02:46:35.500]
He'll be all red in the face

[02:46:36.180 --> 02:46:40.940]
Am I right? Yeah, I mean that no matter what the weather is or they can they're inside or outside

[02:46:40.940 --> 02:46:44.540]
He'll be all right in the post and you'll say hey, what are what are you and he'll say I don't know

[02:46:45.700 --> 02:46:50.720]
And you just kind of like look at him and he'll be staring up into space thinking like he's a moon watch or something

[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:53.300]
Anyway, 11 to 2 it'll be somewhere. We'll tell you where in the morning

Yeah

[02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:52.360]
Baby come play with these cities. This is where I work. There is never never a dull moment at Walmart. I love walking at Walmart

[02:54:52.360 --> 02:54:59.500]
We say at Walmart way after our ships are over partly because we love it but mostly cause they love to thin

[02:54:59.500 --> 02:55:05.800]
There's more than a story to a fun place to be the best thing about being on the Walmart team is not having all those

[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:11.740]
Forms and papers that workers with health benefits have to worry about you never know what you don't find at Walmart

[02:55:11.740 --> 02:55:17.740]
I just came in for the fun of it. The immigrants are the best at Walmart. They clean our toilets practically for free

[02:55:17.740 --> 02:55:24.660]
And Walmart. I don't need no stinkin green card. We don't need no vajas. I don't have to show you I'm a stinking vajas

[02:55:24.660 --> 02:55:29.440]
It's like my morning regime. Tell me and wake up at Walmart. All right

[02:55:30.140 --> 02:55:35.900]
144 there's a little birthday gift for you George. Thank you. And of course the other one will be in the mail this afternoon. Oh

[02:55:36.660 --> 02:55:38.580]
From here though. It might take a few months. Whatever

[02:55:39.820 --> 02:55:44.460]
567 05 60 pound 56 you well. I got some good crap up here. I'll say that good shmit

[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:55.160]
This is Georgia brick. All right. It's about time. 567 05 60 pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line. We have 395 vote on that pool. There is

[02:55:55.900 --> 02:55:56.620]
What's his name?

[02:55:57.440 --> 02:56:01.280]
Rumsfeld gear. You know he's looking more and more like Hermann carrying every day. You know what? Sure

[02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:05.240]
If he would take them. In fact, I think it's a disguise. I think if he took the glasses off

[02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:09.080]
He would be here. I'm gary. Make no mistake because he's working up real big time

[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:12.840]
And he looks just like me starting to when he puts on that military outfit. He's goose stepper

[02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:14.280]
Man

[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:20.720]
What's your take on Al Gore and by the way if you were sleeping in today Al Gore endorsed Howard Dean for president right here on the air

[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:22.320]
with you

[02:56:25.760 --> 02:56:26.480]
Come on

[02:56:26.480 --> 02:56:26.920]
Looks up

[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:33.480]
It's great to be back in Harlem. We shot basketball together one of the last times was here all right

[02:56:34.380 --> 02:56:37.260]
Howard Dean and I are traveling from here to

[02:56:37.820 --> 02:56:38.700]
Iowa and

[02:56:39.580 --> 02:56:45.720]
I'm going to make a more extensive speech at Cedar Rapids a little bit later today. I sure hope so

[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:48.780]
That was good. I'm not going to plead again

[02:56:49.620 --> 02:56:55.560]
Anyway 175 say Al Gore's endorsement of Howard Dean 175 say it'll help him a lot 44% a lot

[02:56:56.480 --> 02:57:02.020]
It'll make no difference 84 21.1 percent. I don't care. I'm you know and those 21 percent aren't for Dean anyway

[02:57:02.020 --> 02:57:08.480]
You see right I don't care. I'm for Bush who certainly aren't for Dean 66 16 and a half percent

[02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:13.160]
Just a little tad below what it usually is in his crowd and of course that's because Russia is probably on right now

[02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:13.980]
You think yeah

[02:57:15.400 --> 02:57:19.780]
If guaranteed that nomination for Dean it shows it. I blocks it. I put it in the old lockbox

[02:57:20.280 --> 02:57:22.580]
As I would say 50 coming a half percent

[02:57:22.580 --> 02:57:24.540]
It'll actually hurt Dean 23

[02:57:25.140 --> 02:57:29.260]
5.7 percent of the very confused public out there in radio land. It'll hurt him

[02:57:29.780 --> 02:57:34.900]
Right. Oh line nine. So we're going to again. Don't you love it? Get it. Get it. It's the best WQ I am

[02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:37.440]
Bobby to meet the richy

[02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:43.680]
Told you what I don't know. I guess it's good as mine WQ I am

[02:57:44.280 --> 02:57:45.420]
Neil yes, sir

[02:57:46.180 --> 02:57:47.340]
I got a spire report of

[02:57:47.340 --> 02:57:50.900]
Moves as we can on the broadcast from the top of the game

[02:57:50.900 --> 02:57:58.440]
He took a shot at Joe Rose when Jamie Neill's helmet fell off. He said wow mad dog said oh he's got a

[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:03.220]
You know tight helmet. He says well, maybe he should take one of Joe Rose's those helmets. Oh no

[02:58:03.220 --> 02:58:10.060]
Yeah, it was like man. He's wrong with Mo anyway. He's got a big heart on yeah, that's the problem from Howard from Boka

[02:58:11.840 --> 02:58:16.940]
Thanks for the great call pali and whatever you do say goodbye to Howard from Boka

[02:58:16.940 --> 02:58:20.780]
permanently I might just have to play that call again. Not today. I'll do it tomorrow

[02:58:21.240 --> 02:58:25.520]
You should play it every day. That's good. Joe Rose hates him all make no mistake about it

[02:58:25.520 --> 02:58:29.820]
She won't think about Joe. He doesn't pull any punches. Nope. Joe Rose is not going to be to run a bush

[02:58:29.820 --> 02:58:34.720]
He's got you know, he's got the job at NBC six. He doesn't really need the radio gig all the work static to have him back trust me

[02:58:35.740 --> 02:58:38.940]
Uh, but the fact that it matter is he just doesn't that beat around a bush

[02:58:38.940 --> 02:58:41.300]
He'll tell it like it is if he hates somebody he'll tell you

[02:58:41.940 --> 02:58:45.020]
And he hates you like poison mo. He don't want nothing to do with you. He don't want to see you

[02:58:45.040 --> 02:58:50.380]
Uh, the beast already reported that the it's his icy is the North Pole in there in the eight o'clock

[02:58:50.380 --> 02:58:53.040]
A turnover in the morning when he's going out and Joe is coming in

[02:58:53.720 --> 02:58:57.320]
Said it was actually like frost on the windows. It might be 85 on the outside

[02:58:57.320 --> 02:58:59.480]
But it's like 20 below zero on the inside

[02:59:00.060 --> 02:59:04.640]
It's bad. There's a chill in the air. You know what I mean? Absolutely. Yeah. He hates him

[02:59:04.640 --> 02:59:09.100]
And Mo didn't show Mo was a no show for the Christmas party last night

[02:59:09.100 --> 02:59:12.100]
And just like the ratings party you know, I wonder why at least I'll give him credit for that

[02:59:12.100 --> 02:59:15.060]
He understands that everybody in the building hates him like poison

[02:59:15.460 --> 02:59:20.760]
Why would you show up for a gathering for a festive event when you know that nobody there's gonna be your friend

[02:59:20.760 --> 02:59:25.200]
It's always a gonna be a bunch of people around you who will hate you who are saying horrible things about you

[02:59:25.200 --> 02:59:31.140]
And your hair piece and your checkered pants and your colostomy bag and all the other good stuff, right? He showed up last year

[02:59:32.160 --> 02:59:38.160]
Yeah, but but he's a little slow on the uptake you know a few months at the by then and at that time he was only blaming you and I

[02:59:38.160 --> 02:59:42.080]
That's right. It was you in the months

[02:59:42.080 --> 02:59:47.580]
It must be part. I must be all of our fault that we talked everybody else into it right? No, I don't think so in a last year

[02:59:47.580 --> 02:59:49.380]
He showed up with the his fancy piece

[02:59:49.380 --> 02:59:54.700]
And he went from table to table greeting and handshaking but avoided our little corner table

[02:59:54.700 --> 02:59:56.240]
Yeah, gave it a wide berth

[02:59:56.240 --> 02:59:59.360]
Was that just because he tried to get your ass fired is that it not a coincidence?

[02:59:59.360 --> 03:00:03.640]
I think because anybody else associated with you must be one of the evil doers that must be it no question

[03:00:03.640 --> 03:00:05.640]
Guess what we hate to like poison Mo

[03:00:06.100 --> 03:00:07.380]
Your show sucks too

[03:00:29.160 --> 03:00:30.320]
And I'll hate you if I die

[03:00:31.040 --> 03:00:31.560]
About

[03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:35.720]
No

[03:00:42.720 --> 03:00:47.560]
Psychopsyscube, Ben engaged in a paper ladet.

[03:00:48.020 --> 03:00:52.440]
Hello, hello, I'm a cranky homophole.

[03:00:53.440 --> 03:00:56.860]
Not that I mind it, but I'm way too old.

[03:00:57.320 --> 03:00:59.900]
I bet the size might be an embed.

[03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:05.020]
In a trist with peddlers, my man friend did it.

[03:01:05.580 --> 03:01:08.260]
I'll kiss and make up with Jinder some day here.

[03:01:09.260 --> 03:01:11.720]
And then ask him to rate my pun.

[03:01:13.080 --> 03:01:15.400]
Now there and over again.

[03:01:17.500 --> 03:01:20.720]
Though I would not deal with more spools.

[03:01:20.980 --> 03:01:28.540]
And I would not be ashamed about a Jinder and more gay union.

[03:01:29.480 --> 03:01:32.160]
Just bold and then stroking away.

[03:01:33.920 --> 03:01:36.820]
Boy, baby, kill me, you're not my type.

[03:01:37.280 --> 03:01:40.920]
It sounds like a nine-year-old kid.

[03:01:42.400 --> 03:01:44.720]
Only a macho-menly guy.

[03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:45.760]
You don't know.

[03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:48.560]
That makes me flip my wig.

[03:01:50.040 --> 03:01:52.620]
If Jinger was a lover of mine,

[03:01:53.860 --> 03:01:56.640]
I'd bury my boldest baby now.

[03:01:57.600 --> 03:02:01.080]
Inside his pimply rear end today.

[03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:05.720]
No, I would not be a sport home.

[03:02:05.840 --> 03:02:06.140]
Now!

[03:02:06.700 --> 03:02:09.160]
If I was not a closet of fame,

[03:02:09.820 --> 03:02:13.160]
That's why a Jinger and more gay union

[03:02:13.160 --> 03:02:17.220]
would make me feel giddy and gay.

[03:02:18.180 --> 03:02:19.920]
Everybody follow my thousand calls.

[03:02:20.240 --> 03:02:23.060]
Yeah, Jinger and more gay union.

[03:02:23.060 --> 03:02:26.980]
What make my swirl pony ass feel safe?

[03:02:28.040 --> 03:02:31.300]
If we had a Jinger and more gay union,

[03:02:31.740 --> 03:02:34.420]
That he wouldn't have to get me raped.

[03:02:34.740 --> 03:02:35.260]
Absolutely.

[03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:38.080]
155 at 560 WQAM.

[03:02:38.080 --> 03:02:39.200]
And a mad dog is sitting by.

[03:02:39.340 --> 03:02:40.040]
He'll be along next.

[03:02:40.280 --> 03:02:41.680]
Licking his wounds from Sunday.

[03:02:42.020 --> 03:02:42.660]
And again, too.

[03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:45.760]
George was to apologize.

[03:02:46.300 --> 03:02:46.960]
I apologize.

[03:02:47.580 --> 03:02:48.600]
For correcting me.

[03:02:48.660 --> 03:02:49.880]
I make enough legitimate mistakes.

[03:02:49.880 --> 03:02:51.540]
Am I without you creating ones for me?

[03:02:51.540 --> 03:02:52.220]
Okay.

[03:02:52.660 --> 03:02:53.420]
I make many mistakes.

[03:02:53.440 --> 03:02:56.200]
Usually one of them is like sitting my ass down here at 730 in the morning.

[03:02:56.760 --> 03:02:58.060]
But Oregon voted for Gore.

[03:02:58.920 --> 03:02:59.840]
Not for Bush.

[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:01.540]
In 2000.

[03:03:02.380 --> 03:03:03.860]
Not according to the map I had.

[03:03:05.080 --> 03:03:06.400]
Well, I don't care what the map says.

[03:03:06.560 --> 03:03:07.840]
I'm reading it right here from CNN.

[03:03:08.080 --> 03:03:10.980]
And they don't make mistakes, Mr. Democrat wins.

[03:03:11.140 --> 03:03:12.240]
And I got the list right here.

[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:14.160]
Okay. Oregon, seven electoral votes.

[03:03:15.320 --> 03:03:17.200]
Are you looking at the right, is the map?

[03:03:17.500 --> 03:03:18.980]
Let me get back at it.

[03:03:19.740 --> 03:03:22.020]
Oregon is like right south of Washington,

[03:03:22.160 --> 03:03:22.580]
right?

[03:03:22.680 --> 03:03:23.420]
No, no, no.

[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:24.080]
Yeah.

[03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:26.360]
It's just between California.

[03:03:26.380 --> 03:03:27.140]
I beg your pardon?

[03:03:28.860 --> 03:03:30.100]
Oh, look at that.

[03:03:30.160 --> 03:03:30.480]
Yeah.

[03:03:30.620 --> 03:03:31.040]
I got it.

[03:03:31.700 --> 03:03:34.560]
No, no, because when you put the mouse over it, it gives you the breakdown.

[03:03:34.940 --> 03:03:35.300]
Yes.

[03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:36.360]
But it's colored in red.

[03:03:36.760 --> 03:03:39.540]
And then when you put the mouse over it, this box pops up.

[03:03:39.540 --> 03:03:45.220]
And it says Gore, 719 165, and both 712 705.

[03:03:45.360 --> 03:03:45.880]
Oh, pretty close.

[03:03:46.100 --> 03:03:46.720]
7000 votes.

[03:03:46.720 --> 03:03:51.000]
I mean, they're like 47% to 47% but nevertheless, they've got it colored wrong on this map here.

[03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:51.800]
Color me wrong.

[03:03:51.860 --> 03:03:52.720]
How do you like that?

[03:03:52.800 --> 03:03:54.760]
Now, who is a whose website is that?

[03:03:54.800 --> 03:03:55.020]
ABC.

[03:03:55.680 --> 03:03:56.840]
What an I tell you.

[03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:03.200]
If you're recall back on that horrible day on the call 2001, if you're me call the president,

[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:05.440]
uh, boy, I sure wish we had that.

[03:04:05.880 --> 03:04:09.920]
But anyway, if you remember, I'm at a ABC was hyperventilating.

[03:04:09.980 --> 03:04:14.000]
Peter Jennings was on there who really blows, and there were made a shamed that he's Canadian.

[03:04:14.120 --> 03:04:14.940]
Mike Myers of Canadian.

[03:04:14.960 --> 03:04:15.520]
There you go.

[03:04:16.280 --> 03:04:19.940]
But, um, talking about how there was another plane hijacked in Seattle.

[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:20.960]
Right.

[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:21.580]
It was a rumor.

[03:04:21.760 --> 03:04:23.120]
And of course, it turned out not to be true.

[03:04:23.220 --> 03:04:23.460]
Thank you.

[03:04:23.580 --> 03:04:23.620]
Correct.

[03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:24.800]
I mean, we had more than enough.

[03:04:25.240 --> 03:04:27.060]
But they were just all over the place.

[03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:30.100]
And so finally, we put on what did I put on the year on MSNBC?

[03:04:31.480 --> 03:04:32.220]
I have CNN.

[03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:37.580]
No, I think we put on MSNBC because they wanted us, of course, in the stage to put on Channel 10, which is ABC,

[03:04:38.140 --> 03:04:39.420]
because we had that working agreement with them.

[03:04:39.640 --> 03:04:41.460]
And what has done about stuff like that?

[03:04:41.540 --> 03:04:41.980]
We liked on.

[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:43.080]
No, we liked Todd Stungham.

[03:04:43.880 --> 03:04:45.500]
That's what the right lot of them said.

[03:04:45.500 --> 03:04:47.200]
He enjoys Todd Stungham, especially on his,

[03:04:47.220 --> 03:04:47.320]
right.

[03:04:47.460 --> 03:04:48.020]
Never less.

[03:04:49.600 --> 03:04:51.440]
So, uh, what am I trying to say?

[03:04:51.800 --> 03:04:52.680]
Oh, ABC don't trust.

[03:04:52.740 --> 03:04:53.200]
It's a full of crap.

[03:04:53.320 --> 03:04:54.200]
No, I do recall.

[03:04:54.760 --> 03:04:55.920]
So you just look on their map.

[03:04:56.160 --> 03:04:58.920]
Now CNN, which I grant you, is just horrible as far as on the year.

[03:04:59.200 --> 03:05:01.180]
But at least on their website, they have some pretty interesting stuff.

[03:05:01.280 --> 03:05:03.860]
Although they did have earlier, Dow hits 10,000.

[03:05:04.160 --> 03:05:06.640]
Or, no, they had Dow passes 10,000.

[03:05:07.280 --> 03:05:09.160]
Is it past 10,000 right now?

[03:05:09.460 --> 03:05:11.240]
I mean, does they want to keep changing it every couple of minutes,

[03:05:11.240 --> 03:05:12.440]
which they don't usually do?

[03:05:12.800 --> 03:05:15.180]
That Dow is 99.74, it's up 8.81.

[03:05:15.720 --> 03:05:18.840]
NASDAQ is down 16, almost 17 points, 1932,

[03:05:18.880 --> 03:05:20.000]
which is good year for FDR.

[03:05:20.300 --> 03:05:21.940]
But other than that, see what I'm saying?

[03:05:22.180 --> 03:05:22.880]
That's my drift.

[03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.320]
So I have figured out how a Howard Dean can win the election.

[03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:27.580]
By running?

[03:05:28.360 --> 03:05:28.900]
That would help.

[03:05:29.320 --> 03:05:31.840]
And by getting Corrie's endorsement, which helps in all the unions.

[03:05:32.440 --> 03:05:34.220]
But I'm serious in talking about the electoral votes.

[03:05:34.360 --> 03:05:37.200]
Why don't we get over this thing with the electoral college, man?

[03:05:37.440 --> 03:05:37.680]
Never.

[03:05:38.420 --> 03:05:39.720]
Jesus freaking raised.

[03:05:39.720 --> 03:05:42.040]
I know when it starts benefiting the Democratic Party.

[03:05:42.080 --> 03:05:44.420]
Oh, then that's when we'll say, oh, yeah, they're voting for it.

[03:05:44.740 --> 03:05:46.000]
And the guy that called it a couple of days ago,

[03:05:46.040 --> 03:05:47.240]
it's always that same old crap.

[03:05:47.600 --> 03:05:49.140]
Oh, yeah, we need a Democratic president

[03:05:49.140 --> 03:05:50.620]
and Republican Congress, right?

[03:05:50.900 --> 03:05:53.360]
So that we can have this gigantic, unbelievable,

[03:05:53.660 --> 03:05:55.700]
pork-filled budget that they passed yesterday.

[03:05:56.140 --> 03:05:59.460]
Number one, and number two, so that every right-wing piece of legislation

[03:05:59.460 --> 03:06:01.400]
can get muscled through there, okay?

[03:06:01.620 --> 03:06:04.840]
And they'll have more than enough people to override a presidential veto by any Democrat.

[03:06:05.280 --> 03:06:06.300]
Right, that makes a lot of sense.

[03:06:06.300 --> 03:06:06.640]
No.

[03:06:06.760 --> 03:06:07.140]
No.

[03:06:08.500 --> 03:06:08.880]
Florida?

[03:06:09.280 --> 03:06:11.600]
I mean, we actually won it, so he needs to do that.

[03:06:11.840 --> 03:06:12.200]
Mm-hmm.

[03:06:12.980 --> 03:06:14.080]
I'm not saying he needs to win all of these,

[03:06:14.140 --> 03:06:16.500]
because he can actually lose like Iowa, maybe Illinois, maybe both.

[03:06:16.860 --> 03:06:17.320]
New Hampshire.

[03:06:17.560 --> 03:06:19.580]
He's going to, he's going to sweep all in the wing, including New Hampshire.

[03:06:19.840 --> 03:06:20.160]
Nevada.

[03:06:20.700 --> 03:06:21.280]
Don't win in Nevada.

[03:06:21.980 --> 03:06:23.980]
Tennessee, where Al Gore lost his home state,

[03:06:24.120 --> 03:06:25.620]
Tennessee could, as a possibility,

[03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:27.700]
the only state I see in the South besides Florida.

[03:06:28.060 --> 03:06:30.500]
And West Virginia, which frequently does go Democratic, okay?

[03:06:30.780 --> 03:06:33.360]
If he goes in there and pays off enough people, enough of them cool people.

[03:06:33.680 --> 03:06:34.140]
You see what I'm saying?

[03:06:34.400 --> 03:06:35.320]
Right, those cold people.

[03:06:35.560 --> 03:06:37.440]
Those cold people in West Virginia.

[03:06:37.720 --> 03:06:38.060]
Absolutely.

[03:06:38.060 --> 03:06:40.880]
My dog, who's pretty cool from his trip to New England on Sunday,

[03:06:40.980 --> 03:06:43.180]
is going to rehash and re-examine him.

[03:06:43.240 --> 03:06:45.760]
And I'll tell you one thing, boy, don't pay for your sure-have-been-lucky.

[03:06:46.020 --> 03:06:47.000]
Bye, bye, bye!

[03:06:47.620 --> 03:06:50.720]
I'm going to watch your show on Plymouth's E-M-E-Q-A-N,

[03:06:50.820 --> 03:06:52.000]
Miami for my hangout.

[03:06:52.100 --> 03:06:53.160]
You just pound it silly.

[03:06:53.320 --> 03:06:54.620]
And then whatever comes out, eat it.
