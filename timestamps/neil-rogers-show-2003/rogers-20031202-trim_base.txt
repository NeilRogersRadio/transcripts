[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.740]
Let's record radio big shot.

[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.000]
That's how we pass the time away in the G.O.J. Little Haws.

[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.980]
It's time to get it on.

[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.180]
Moohawar the monkey faster.

[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.480]
Has a variable this nose.

[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.260]
When he gets raped or plastered,

[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.460]
the veins on his nose will blow the movement.

[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.520]
Everybody hates him.

[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.900]
Except the head full of whole bones.

[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.720]
Four holes in a pile of great tears.

[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.980]
Grab the morning show that blows.

[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.640]
One day the well dressed red breed has no gentile.

[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.520]
My CTLs needs a new headlight.

[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.120]
You mind if I borrowed your veins tonight?

[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.980]
There's another line that goes here.

[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.040]
But I'm a love eventually with your fluid.

[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.080]
I'm listening.

[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.920]
Mastik crank keep it to the end.

[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.900]
Ten I wanted five sixty WQM.

[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.120]
We must be both psychic because we're just talking moments before the conclusion of the Joe Roe show this morning.

[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.520]
Meer moments ago.

[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.140]
That it was going to be a financial thing.

[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.080]
See they keep making up these stories about well NBC6 has to decide what a Joe Roe can do permanent 8-10 on QYM.

[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.200]
Well they could decide that.

[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.920]
It's either one of the other two seconds.

[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.560]
And the fact that he's been fillin now for about 100 weeks indicates to me the answer is yes.

[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.360]
Pretty simple.

[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.600]
So that's just a cover story for the fact that Beasley is too cheap.

[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.920]
And he's trying to squeeze a lot more money out of Greg because he's got him over a barrel.

[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.980]
He's got about a short hairs.

[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.760]
We all know that.

[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.780]
Well, since he's going to stick in there between 8 and 10 and the very Jack S three points out accurately that it's going to be Joe Rose with guilty.

[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.460]
Because guilty don't want to be working with that cranky old man one more day.

[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.040]
What?

[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.700]
He told me that last Friday that I was there.

[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.940]
I told he's stopping the hallway.

[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.680]
I went in to take a leak and I thought I was going to pee my pants.

[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.740]
Not because he was so funny, but because I couldn't get inside the tea room because he did.

[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.540]
He was just squeaking up a store man.

[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.580]
Well, it's not a secret.

[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.100]
Oh, it's not.

[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.400]
No.

[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.500]
And of course in most cases, I guess at this point what differences make it you know one more person that he finds out hates him like poison.

[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.760]
What difference is going to possibly make because he's banning a thousand.

[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.200]
Right.

[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.740]
You got to give him that drop in the ocean.

[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.240]
Everybody in the building hates him like poison.

[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.080]
So who's going to work with him?

[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.840]
Beast.

[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.860]
I think that would be now is the beast there today.

[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.000]
Yeah.

[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.920]
He is.

[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.620]
He's the one that pointed out the article to me.

[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.760]
All right.

[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:56.660]
Let's hear maybe he was doing that so we would talk about it and then maybe get him back in the door because if Joe and Geltie are going to be together again, we sure don't need the beast in there butting in being a third person, third demand in.

[00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.000]
Right.

[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.560]
Right.

[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.300]
Right.

[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.460]

[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.260]
Maybe we can get the beast to come in and discuss with us for about ten seconds.

[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.100]
Just a joke, Beast.

[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.780]
Get that out.

[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.960]
That was fast.

[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.120]
What do you mean?

[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.860]
Before you were doing a sentence.

[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.600]
So what does he got to say?

[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.240]
Put a moment there by that mic, okay?

[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.580]
He's coming in here boy.

[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.120]
He can't.

[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.460]
I'll bet.

[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.140]
He's a boy.

[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.180]
He's really the big and the taste of him open his big push.

[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.780]
You have a better chance of me being anorexic than working with him again.

[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.880]
Then you working with Moa again while you see it's easy for you to say that and open up a big centurion push.

[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.640]
But if they powers the B-tegged that's it, you're not going to like walk out.

[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.920]
You're not going to walk away from a plush job.

[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.580]
What if they make you an offer you can't refuse?

[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.860]
Right.

[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.980]
What if they say, hey, well, double your pay and we'll let you sit in his lap couple of days a week.

[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.440]
So I get paid six bucks an hour now.

[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.900]
Right.

[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.040]
That's right. He has rich parents.

[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.660]
He doesn't have this.

[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.860]
And you get to split the freebies from how he's with the with the moment.

[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.860]
But Beast has to do all the tipping.

[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.500]
Right.

[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.900]
What are you saying?

[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.780]
No.

[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.680]
No.

[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.360]
What would it take?

[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.460]
What would it take?

[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.040]
Would Moa have to let you like changes hair piece every day during the show

[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.880]
and rub his vault spot when I do it like a Buddha?

[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.420]
Only if the beast doesn't have to clean out his bag anymore.

[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.760]
And listen to this.

[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.280]
Moa might be inspired to leave the piece home because could you see the two shiny vault spots

[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.920]
there side by side to make a great make a great billboard.

[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.540]
If you press their heads together, it would be illegal and broward.

[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.240]
Oh yeah.

[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.080]
Rub it up, dub.

[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.820]
Throw Moa in the tub.

[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.460]
Absolutely.

[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.400]
I can just see it now.

[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.960]
Okay, that's it.

[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.360]
Pie Beast.

[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.360]
When is it start?

[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.860]
When is he starting with Moa?

[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.560]
He's already started with no one show no that started in with Moa woman rams

[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.020]
car into gas pump after clerk won't sell her booze.

[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.860]
This is a great story.

[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.740]
Got a lot of good stuff here, including Perry Jackass's column.

[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.320]
Thank you, Beast.

[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.220]
By the way, for pointing that out because you're the only one desperate enough in the building to read

[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.920]
very Jackass.

[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.140]
So he's the only one knew about it.

[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.080]
Plus Moa and then Joe.

[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.300]
I'm thinking at what?

[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.480]
Because I'm not really big on the crossover thing.

[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.360]
It was fine with for real.

[00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.320]
We had a lot of good fun.

[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.240]
But Joe and I, Joe does a sports show and I do my own wacky thing here.

[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.340]
But I'm thinking that maybe once in a while Joe and I could conspare because they're at the end.

[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.700]
I was like just Jones and a jump in, you know.

[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.600]
More to you?

[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.460]
Oh man, Joe got like here a little bit there.

[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.840]
Rip and Moa and ass about very Jackass and about don't feel bad because

[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.120]
Grace is your program is entertaining and you don't have to refer to it every day.

[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.120]
And I know you're not listening and all I could stop.

[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.580]
Absolutely.

[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.460]
But maybe we could do like a rip low crossover once in a great while.

[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.340]
You know.

[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.000]
Yeah, I was thinking about it.

[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.300]
I was thinking about it.

[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.720]
That was just tiny.

[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.840]
Oh, we better before we do the story about the woman Randi Agass pump.

[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.120]
Here's the results from yesterday's marginal second pool.

[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.400]
Actually, we had a pretty good response.

[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.160]
958 votes for a, well, it was a good pull question.

[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.540]
I just don't think they get it because we got so many parochial people there who don't go nowhere.

[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.560]
In what city in the world you find the highest percentage of the people are very, very, very ugly.

[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.260]
Even uglier than me, which is saying a lot.

[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.580]
High Alia, which was a late addition, passed everybody else like it was standing still, man.

[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.560]
High Alia 237.

[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.160]
Is that true?

[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.180]
Oh, I don't get to high Alia's often as I use to.

[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.540]
I haven't been to high Alia since the last time I was at the race track there, which is about

[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.180]
oh, years and years and years ago.

[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.480]
Yeah.

[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.060]
Remember that when I would do when we were trying to save High Alia and I still don't know why because

[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.240]
John Brennan was a real asshole.

[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.100]
I haven't been to High Alia since I stopped working at these sewing sweatshirts.

[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.860]
Since before, hey Zeus was a baby.

[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.560]
High Alia 237, Tampa 141 and Hollywood Florida 111.

[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.440]
That's the frog factory.

[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.520]
But you notice the fact that the top three in our pull result happened to be in Florida.

[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.140]
Because most of the people in Florida, I mean, I definitely don't get around too much.

[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.840]
So they had a beeper all the Montreal, over 100.

[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.900]
I'm proud of that 102.

[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.820]
That was the obvious clear choice.

[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.780]
Montreal 102.

[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.000]
Cleveland, a very competitive second 97.

[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.460]
Ye Paris, Paris France was the only non-North American city on air.

[00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.520]
Paris had 80.

[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.480]
O'Cowah had 70.

[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.960]
Nashville 49.

[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.700]
Reading, Pennsylvania 36.

[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.640]
I don't think there are that many people living in Pennsylvania.

[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:08.600]
How many people live there?

[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.520]
About 30 men.

[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.620]
But 36 said the ugliest people in the world are in Reading, PA.

[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.000]
Asheville, North Carolina 33.

[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.100]
And Barca Lono, which I still don't believe had six votes.

[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.260]
I have to find out it's bogus.

[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.840]
Probably somebody couldn't get laid in Barca Lono said that.

[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.460]
Saur grapes.

[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.480]
Not buying it.

[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.340]
So that's yesterday's pull result.

[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.940]
We got two great pulls for you again today.

[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.120]
Should we do the first one?

[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.960]
I give the first one quickly, OK?

[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.620]
OK.

[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.080]
What was your take on GW Bush's surprise Thanksgiving?

[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.700]
Now you didn't do this on Friday, did you?

[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.240]
No, I did not.

[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.500]
I was amazed that people that's right.

[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.640]
I knew you didn't do it because you did that one about what's more important.

[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.780]
Living forever or having a horseshoe up your ass.

[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.140]
Right.

[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.580]
What was your take on George W Bush's surprise Thanksgiving visit to the troops in Iraq?

[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.000]
We got five choices for you here.

[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.100]
It was strictly politics.

[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.580]
It was a brilliant way to upstage Hillary.

[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.060]
It was clearly courageous designed a bolster troop morale.

[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.000]
Why didn't he stay longer and see what's really happening?

[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.540]
Or it was a sorry ass photo op, nothing more?

[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.360]
I think that covers all the bases, don't you?

[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:16.280]
What was your take on GW Bush's surprise Thanksgiving visit to the troops in Iraq on Thanksgiving day?

[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.900]
It was strictly politics.

[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.080]
It was a brilliant way to upstage Hillary.

[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.120]
It was clearly courageous designed a bolster troop morale.

[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.960]
Very courageous, by the way, so courageous that he was watching the radar almost every second he said of the trip in Air Force 1.

[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.260]
When he saw the British Airways guy, he almost made them turn around and go back.

[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.280]
But it was very courageous from our AWOL president.

[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.880]
Why didn't he stay longer and see what's really happening?

[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.980]
Or it was a sorry ass photo op, nothing more, which I think is probably the definitive answer.

[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.820]
A woman rams car at a gas pump after clerk won't sell her alcohol.

[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:57.340]
Dady police are searching for a woman who rammed her car to a gas pump early this morning, causing the pump to explode and catch fire after intended to refuse to sell her alcohol.

[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.320]
Shortly after five o'clock this morning, police say a woman appeared to be inebriated, walked into the sit-co gas station.

[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.800]
I wonder how Brian Murray would say that.

[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.460]
The sit-co gas station at 3301 North University Drive and tried to purchase wine and beer.

[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:21.240]
The clerk refused to sell the host of the woman described as a five foot five blonde weighing about 120 pounds, citing city and county ordinances that prohibit the sale of beer or wine before 6 in the AM.

[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.400]
She became irate and started screaming at the clerk but he held his ground.

[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.780]
Dady police lieutenant Bill Bamford said the woman then wqa m.

[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.300]
Hello. Yes.

[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.400]
Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Oh, you picking up the cold.

[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.840]
Wow, I just saw the line ringing out of the corner of my eye. I thought I might be pretty important.

[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.940]
I think you should combine the first one and the last one kind of the same as the crossover.

[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.040]
You know, something more in a sorry as far as the limit is motivated.

[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.220]
It's slightly different, new ones but they're close.

[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:57.180]
Yeah, that way you might get a true or a gauge on the, by the way, that's my, I'm officially chiming in as the first vote.

[00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.580]
Which one?

[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.560]
You know, politically motivated nothing more than a sorry as photo op.

[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.580]
That's the same thing and it was just embarrassing and I'm just, I can't do it.

[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:14.460]
I'm really into the real bad. I'm the most embarrassed by the so called the Democrats and liberal pundits who are afraid to just call it for what it really was.

[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.560]
Why? Why? Why is everybody so? Why is everybody afraid?

[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.520]
What's going on? What am I going to do there?

[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.080]
We're in all the Michael Moore's out there. We're in the world.

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.680]
I don't get it. They're all like, they all have to be very, you know, on there like walking on aveshells, you know.

[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.440]
I mean, where's Howard Beale when you need him, you know?

[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.040]
Exactly. Okay. Have a great day, Pally.

[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.720]
Hi, Neil. And actually a real caller right off the bat. See, I knew it. I saw it all the corner of my eye.

[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.420]
We're going to have to reset Daesh's computer because he can't answer the phone. It's just so you know.

[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.760]
Oh, well, we don't need to answer the phone.

[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:43.500]
Okay.

[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.580]
Anyway, this woman became my rate and started screaming at the clerk, but he held his ground.

[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.720]
The woman then jumped into her dark colored car, squeal out of the parking lot before leaving the area.

[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.160]
She slammed on her brakes, raised backward in her vehicle, striking a gas pump which exploded and erupted into flames.

[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.840]
She left behind the back bumper of her vehicle in the parking lot.

[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.620]
The clerk told Poole East, the woman often comes in the store and lives nearby.

[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.460]
They have a video of the woman from a camera installed in a gas station.

[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.480]
Detectives are searching, released. They were, they probably got her ass already.

[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.360]
Searching nearby apartment complexes, looking for the vehicle were expected to make an arrest today, pronto.

[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.400]
Because she left first of all the bumper from the car and secondly, they got her on tape and thirdly, she's there all the time.

[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.200]
And she had a little problem. Okay. Now probably was just an accident, don't you think?

[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.380]
Oh yeah, I'm sure. Well, it happens all the time in Florida.

[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.160]
We're guys, the old parts, they think that they're hitting the brake and actually hitting the accelerator. Oops.

[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:39.540]
Oops, there we go. Now we have that Barry Jackass story that we all missed yesterday, but it's a good thing because nobody was listed yesterday anyway,

[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.120]
because it was the day after Thanksgiving weekend. And we're just now starting to put the pieces of our lives back together again.

[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:52.680]
So we got a very, very important Mohawar David Barry Jackass story from yesterday's Miami Herald and then a bunch of other crap as well.

[00:11:52.680 --> 00:12:00.480]
And that first pull, which will be up momentarily by the way, I just took a look over there and I thought for sure it'd be up there already, but it was my bad.

[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.260]
Why is that because I haven't fastened until like two minutes ago.

[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.480]
You didn't fasten the Eric yet, I fasten to you like at 738 this morning. Yeah, I know.

[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:15.360]
Smuck, 12 minutes after 10 at 560 WQM. Imagine, imagine Todd Wreck bleeding to death in your living room.

[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:26.940]
Imagine zero closing costs, imagine zero applications fee, zero credit bureau fee, zero discounted points. Imagine Todd Wreck skewered on long end of a sharp stick.

[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:36.600]

My My and Love, this is 4.2560, and we can weigh in.

[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:45.820]
The blockbuster hit pirates of the Caribbean, followed by haunted mansion, and now, Disney Studios presents another exciting film based on an old part ride.

[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.180]
It's Michael Jackson's Happy E-O!

[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.380]
Happy E-O! I think we're under attack!

[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.120]
Don't bother me now, I'm signing my pink suit, James.

[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.220]
Oh, Gavin E-O, they're handling us.

[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:11.060]
Okay, here I come. Oh, and I'll be right there.

[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.180]
We have a warrant, Mr. Jackson. Give yourself up.

[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:22.360]
Oh, the skate bar is ready. I got it, you hope. The skate bar is ready.

[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:32.360]
I'm so, oh, oh, the handling frequency. I'm sorry, officers. I can't surrender now.

[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:38.820]
Oh, oh, oh, and why not? I'm standing here, making my pain and stuff.

[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.700]
Michael Jackson stars in Captain E-O by a ticket at 4.0.

[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.040]
Because he's rich, so he must be better than us.

[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:57.140]
10.19 at 5.60, we got the new national inquiry I got sent right here a little bit later on.

[00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.380]
All the latest on a little bit more spicy stuff in there.

[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.900]
Jackson victim speaks where claims Jacko took new photos of him and showed him X-rated videos.

[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.540]
Oh, my God.

[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.300]
How do you like that?

[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.240]
I like that.

[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.040]
There's more than meets the eye of this Michael Jackson story, but nevertheless.

[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.420]
More than I can.

[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:23.020]
And again, the media just never failed to astonish me. For example, the fact that they found this tape where the mother, and she says,

[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.760]
oh, he was nothing but wonderful to them and the family and the kid.

[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.380]
There was never anything inappropriate. What kind of a person has a parent make a tape like that?

[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:37.500]
Unless they have reason to fear that they shoe is about to drop.

[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.180]
See what I'm saying?

[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.880]
Why would you ever have anybody make a tape like that?

[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.520]
Daniel, could you make a tape that says the...

[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.260]
Daniel, it was...

[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.520]
He always nice and, you know, I can't lie that way.

[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:54.180]
Anyway, there's just a crawl on CNN. I saw the corner of my other eye moments ago.

[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.860]
UN study says the flow of money, arms and support for Al Qaeda is growing rapidly.

[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.360]
Now, isn't this exactly what Sami Yamamas said predicted was going to happen?

[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:04.620]
Right.

[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.040]
If we invaded Iraq?

[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.400]
Remember that poster we had a comical line?

[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.920]
Right. I want you to invade Iraq.

[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.440]
Exactly.

[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.660]
And Bush said, okay.

[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.640]
Sure. We got that big hose. I'll set the Chevron people to hook up to the gas to the oil.

[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.860]
And who was supposed to be fighting the evil diversion instead?

[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.680]
We're wasting 100 billion dollars in all of these lives against a bunch of people

[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.780]
who their biggest crime was living under a brutal dictator that the CIA stuck in in the first place.

[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.280]
God, that was the biggest crime of all these people that are dying.

[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.540]
And then that bank heist that took place over the weekend.

[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:47.040]
Well, all of those people supposedly were insurgents, Iraqi insurgents,

[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.860]
come to fight out a bunch of more just sluppers who happen to be in a wrong place at the wrong time, as usual.

[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.420]
At least the aid of them.

[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.940]
And maybe you're a lot more.

[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:54.820]
They had a lot of fun.

[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.500]
Oh, speaking of more.

[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.220]
Well, let's see how that pool is starting.

[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.440]
Now we got a small spattering of hope. Just went on there.

[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.720]
See, that's bad. We got to get those on there right away.

[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:04.520]
My bad.

[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:05.980]
Don't be doing that no more.

[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.180]
Alex who's just obsessed.

[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.460]
Well, we got so many people obsessed with this program.

[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.120]
I mean, just obsessed. You know what I mean?

[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:13.040]
Uh-huh.

[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.220]
In fact, I'm listening.

[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:15.960]
See what I mean?

[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.480]
Oh, listen, if I just get to come, I'll believe you me.

[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.500]
Talking about the shoe drop.

[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.220]
And by the way, I wouldn't count on being around till the spring of 2006,

[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.820]
based on some conversations I had before to show this morning with certain powers that be.

[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.100]
They're planning on having a weeny roast at P.P. Park before the next off-and-home game.

[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.440]
Maybe at halftime.

[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.840]
And right at the 50-yard line, they're going to like put him on like a like a pig on a spit.

[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.000]
And they're going to roast Mo right there in the 50-yard line.

[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.760]
Wouldn't that be a beautiful thing?

[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.920]
In fact, you might actually show up for that game.

[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:45.540]
Yeah, I would.

[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.700]
I'll bring a cake.

[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:48.920]

[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.720]
Yeah, they can like make most sandwiches at the concession stand.

[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.380]
I'm listening.

[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.420]
Okay, calm down, you silly old fart.

[00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:00.580]
Alex says, hey, Neil, I think that measlies are starting to make their final decision on the morning show

[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.060]
till the end of the dolphin season so they can blow Mo the hell out of there.

[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.660]
And then that way bring back Bill Zimper back to work with the man of dog.

[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.320]
Everything will be back to the go-to days.

[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.380]
Life with our Mo will truly be paradise.

[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.320]
Burn in hell Mo and take one from little Havani with you.

[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.920]
And then it says, we hate Mo in gigantic letters with eight million exclamation per.

[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.900]
Maybe not eight million, but at least three million.

[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.760]
Keep ripping Mo it says it's great.

[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.520]
And it is great in the sunshine state.

[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.220]
I'm listening.

[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.860]
Especially knowing that he's listening right now and hang on every word.

[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.540]
I'm listening.

[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.640]
Knowing that Joe Rose ripped him a major ass.

[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.200]
Now maybe Alex is on to something for once, you think?

[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:33.940]
Lighty.

[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.180]
I'm not saying to go wait till the end of football season because they can't wait that long.

[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:43.260]
But maybe the idea is that somewhere along the line here they'll pay the sorry old man off.

[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.820]
All the way, I don't think the beesleaves will do that.

[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.740]
And then have Joe and the Geldy on her six to ten.

[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.860]
Why would they divide it up?

[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.220]
Why would they do a silly thing like that?

[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.720]
They did it before as a way to get farrell on the air which they now regret unfortunately.

[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.540]
It just turned out bad all the way around.

[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.420]
It was a great concept, but the less you say about that the better.

[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.380]
And then this morning, 7.15 I come in here like I do every morning.

[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.080]
Drag my ass out of bed.

[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.180]
And before I shave, shower, smit, and do all the other things, I open up the pot.

[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.320]
Smoke a little.

[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.560]
Now I open up the pot, listen to whatever's going on just to make sure that we are in contact.

[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.580]
And there's Mo.

[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.380]
And he's going on.

[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.240]
The first thing I hear right out of the box, well I picked up all the foreels friends out there.

[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.600]
I talked to Scott yesterday and he's doing just fine.

[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.540]
Forellers doing fine and these are okay.

[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.920]
And I talk to myself, you know, for while you are your own worst enemy because you don't know who your friends are.

[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.080]
I'm sure he's listening right now too.

[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.120]
Scott, you just don't get it, do you?

[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.920]
Here's a guy that like danced on your grave the minute after you got canned,

[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.440]
went on the year and encouraged his audience for three solid hours to call.

[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.680]
And he begged them and pleaded and cajoled them to call in and rip you an ass.

[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.840]
And danced on your grave and the fact that you got your ass fired.

[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.540]
And in the meantime, you're talking to this son of a bitch, this miserable bastard.

[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.120]
Absolutely.

[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.000]
Oh man.

[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.160]
Aren't you shocked at that?

[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.020]
Well, how much does it take?

[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.220]
First we already know that some people never listen.

[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:08.440]
That's unfortunate for all of us because it was like somebody putting a pin prick in the good year blimp the whole of the well thing.

[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.200]
We have, remember, kept talking about that moe, mint in that we had.

[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.420]
Not following moe, no moe.

[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.400]
We had a big moment and go and I could feel it.

[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.160]
You could smell it.

[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.800]
And then all of a sudden it was like like that, like somebody stuck it with a pin.

[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.520]
It just felt like a prick.

[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:33.320]
And speaking of pricks, Barry Jackass writes in yesterday's Miami-Herald column in his rambling column.

[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.500]
In response to a recent column about WQAM struggle.

[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.960]
And by the way, Joe Rose is in with Greg Rie right now.

[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:40.920]
They're hammering out the deal.

[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.760]
Okay, so have no fear because he wouldn't be in there talking about money if NBC 6 and any pro.

[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.400]
Why would they have any problem with them doing it?

[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.460]
It's just a higher visibility for their sports guy.

[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:49.660]
Right.

[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.600]
For his promotion.

[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:51.380]
Of course.

[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.340]
They're not going to have any problem with that.

[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.120]
So don't you a folks worry about that.

[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.140]
And I really got all whipped up when Joe started ripping Moe at the end of the show.

[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.440]
I think that I really believe that could be a regular feature.

[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:01.500]
Right.

[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.640]
We don't have to cross over.

[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.340]
He's good at them.

[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.000]
So because he hates Moe with a passion.

[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.460]
It's just see it's one thing when people dislike somebody who works in a workplace.

[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.640]
Everybody dislikes that person.

[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.700]
This is way beyond dislike.

[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.440]
This is a hatred so deep.

[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.220]
It's like a purple rage.

[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.620]
You know what I mean?

[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:22.440]
Mm-hmm.

[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.420]
Like you can see the veins in their neck.

[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.460]
The veins in their forehead start like trying to pop out, you know.

[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.760]
Just at the mention of the other person's name.

[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.600]
So it probably will please you no end Moe to know that Joe hates you even more than I do if that's possible.

[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.460]
And Gildi echoes that emotion.

[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.440]
Even though he's going to have to be in there for another few days, whatever it's going to be.

[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.600]
He can't wait till the last day when he, uh,

[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.320]
where you don't darken his life no more.

[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:48.720]
Can't stand it.

[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:49.820]
Can't take it.

[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.640]
Told me that right to my push right outside the tea room there that Friday.

[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.060]
I could get finally to the date that Friday in November.

[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:57.640]
2003.

[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.080]
Couldn't get the hell away from me.

[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.060]
He just went on and on whining like a like a child.

[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.360]
Don't let me forget to get to the very jackass column by the way.

[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.940]
Well, we got great time again, man.

[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.120]
We got to get these spots in here.

[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.360]
We got a lot of call or two coming in their screen.

[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.060]
Let's cause Josh can't answer the phone.

[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:17.720]
That's okay.

[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.960]
Don't worry about those things.

[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.160]
Don't worry about anything at all because life is sweet.

[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.480]
You know, the checks are clear in the bank.

[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.240]
Places going to hell on a hand basket.

[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.020]
Greg is doing his best to try to put the pieces back together.

[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.840]
He keeps smashing them and crashing them.

[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.780]
You heard what their clearance said this morning about mode engine.

[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.820]
I better not repeat it.

[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.300]
No better not.

[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.720]
61 votes on a poll so far.

[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.640]
What was your take on George W. Bush's surprise Thanksgiving visit to the troops in Iraq?

[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.580]
It was a sorry ass photo op nothing more 28.

[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.500]
It was clearly a courageous act designed a bolster troop morale 12.

[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.480]
Why didn't he stay longer and see what's really going on nine?

[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.360]
It was strictly politics seven and it was a brilliant way to upstage Hillary five.

[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.120]
Proofstates swallery.

[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:03.660]
Hey, Shelley Bloom's fashion code is been around a long time longer than some of you have been alive in South Florida.

[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:09.000]
40 years from the same great location at 2650 Northwest Fifth Avenue and Miami Fashion District.

[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.680]
At Shelley Bloom's you'll find fine men's clothing.

[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:19.060]
We're talking about beautiful goods from suits, sport coats, slacks, dress and sports shirts, ties, and one of the largest selection of designer shoes anywhere in town.

[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:24.360]
Shelly's got Italian slacks super one twenties and 15 colors for just 60 bucks.

[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:32.900]
George you are money suits that sell from 1395 to 1595 are only 795 bucks that's about half price at Shelley Bloom's fashion clothing.

[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.500]
So why get ripped off of the other joints?

[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:41.000]
Shelly even offers a fantastic selection of Italian suits and suits starting at just 225 bucks a piece.

[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:47.300]
Service selection and price those are the three ingredients that Shelley's made sure he's kept to go and strong for over 40 years.

[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.940]
That's why he's still going a better than ever.

[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.020]
Selection is fantastic.

[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.260]
All derrations are always free.

[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:57.300]
With thousands and thousands literally of suits and stock up to size 70, you're sure you're going to find what you're looking for.

[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:04.140]
So quit overspending at those malls especially now when it's rip off time during the holidays and make the trip to Shelley Bloom's in the heart of the fashion district.

[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.340]
They're open Monday through Saturday 930 in the morning till 6 in the PM.

[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.600]
If you want to compare price, just talk turkey.

[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.420]
Give Shelley a call at 305-5735890.

[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.900]
That's 305-5735890.

[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:21.740]
Legendary and self-loaded Shelley Bloom's fashion clothing is well worth the trip from anywhere.

[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.460]
Finder and local, this is 560.

[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.360]
The rain is on your side.

[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.000]
You will.

[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.520]
Madonna.

[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:32.920]
Yeah, I know I have a great time.

[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.720]
Which opens, why does they say?

[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.500]
Yeah, they do.

[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.180]
Does it feel weird to make love to someone while your husband's watching?

[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.000]
No, absolutely not. He's my skeptical at first.

[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:43.280]
Really?

[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.220]
No, I just don't care.

[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.000]
I want to do them because I want the experience.

[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.460]
Yeah, always been like that.

[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:48.840]
Oh God.

[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:49.440]
Yeah.

[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.360]
I guess it's Madonna.

[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.380]
I like sex. It's like food.

[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.820]
You've always been a good ride.

[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:54.980]
I have.

[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.480]
1032 at 560.

[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:58.920]
W.C.O.

[00:24:58.940 --> 00:24:59.460]
I mean, other story.

[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.840]
You just thanks me Louisiana School Punishers 7-year-old for talking about lesbian mother.

[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.340]
Mm-hmm.

[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.380]
Just happens to be on our website and I have it sitting here in my pile.

[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.920]
But thank you anyway, whoever sent it.

[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:13.220]
I mean, we do appreciate all of this stuff, like Bob Lansford used to say we appreciate it.

[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:17.780]
But the fact that it matters is if you check out the 80 million good stories that we have on our website every day,

[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.700]
then you'd save us a lot of time and grief and thanks paper.

[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.600]
Am I right?

[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.020]
Yes.

[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:23.340]
Right.

[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.340]
Also, before I do get to that very jackass story,

[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.140]
CNN speaking of polls has taken a poll on your website.

[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.740]
And the question is,

[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.520]
The Cincinnati Police Act appropriately in subduing a 300.

[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.560]
See, it's amazing.

[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.540]
The good news for him is he lost 50 pounds in one day.

[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.900]
The bad news is he's still dead.

[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.920]
What they tell us yesterday he was 400 pounds?

[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:46.540]
Right.

[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.560]
Little exaggeration.

[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.160]
Did Cincinnati Police Act appropriately in subduing a 350 pound man who later died?

[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.200]
And of course, we've all seen that video over and over.

[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.200]
How many times we seen it?

[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.200]
About 30, man.

[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:05.080]
At least 57,287 votes of whenever I printed this thing out.

[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.060]
57,287.

[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.160]
Yes, 71% note 29%.

[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.720]
He, they found the cocaine and PCP in his system.

[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.180]
Got it?

[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:19.460]
And?

[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:20.620]
What's that?

[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.140]
What's that?

[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.560]
He was out of control.

[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.380]
Have you watched it over and over and over again?

[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:26.580]
Of course.

[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.020]
Slow mo free, stream instant replay.

[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.160]
Have you watched it?

[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:29.520]
There.

[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.260]
Million times?

[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:31.880]
I'm not all right.

[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:37.420]
Plus he was black and fat, had a record, had a rat sheet as long as the beast penis.

[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.920]
What the hell, more could you want?

[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:39.700]
Was it a hit record?

[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.440]
Anyway, here's a very jackass story.

[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.420]
Look at that.

[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.620]
There is speaking of our poll.

[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.200]
But that it was between the British Airways pilot and the controlled tower.

[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:55.640]
But regardless British Airways says that they have still not heard anything from any of their pilots that they saw

[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.960]
Yes, you'd a pilot sir keeping quite you want to know why cuz they all valued their lives

[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:05.340]
Why they just don't want to be interrogated and you know raked over the coals and then maybe like son off to see the queen and never show up again

[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.460]
You know how those things go

[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.000]
Look at away that poll is turning out. This is shocking to me

[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.820]
What was your take on GW Bush's surprise? Thanks giving visit to troops in Iraq. It was a sorry as photo op nothing more

[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:25.640]
55 that's 50% but it was clearly courageous designed a bolster troop morale 25 that's 23%

[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:31.660]
Are you believe in this audience 23% of our mind and that crap? No, it was strictly politics 14

[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:37.740]
Why didn't he stay longer and see what's really happening in Iraq 10 and was a brilliant way to upstage Hillary five out of

[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:44.420]
109 votes 23% so far say it was clearly courageous designed a bolster troop morale. I'll question about it

[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:52.820]
Courageous that's why it was like kept top secret even from most of them from did you know that the Bush one and the

[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.800]
Martha Washington whatever held her name is bads. They didn't even know about it

[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:01.900]
No, I didn't know that they didn't even know about it and Laura only thought out about like a couple days ahead of time

[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.560]
She said oh maybe he won't come back or something like that

[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.240]
How do you like that really courageous?

[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.660]
Which is why like I said he kept checking a radar anywhere. We'll get to that later

[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.460]
Here's very jackass is columninoid took me 35 minutes to get to it nice going Neil

[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.060]
Thank you. Well, I'm so whipped up because the Joe Rose is great comments here at the end of his show

[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:26.640]
Yeah, haha could have knocked me over with the feather you go Joe you go Joe

[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.060]
You're the man you demand see he's pulling the gloves off. He's gonna be I'm listening

[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:35.860]
Rip and moan asked every day for which is another reason the most reading nervous and crawling people like very jackass

[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:41.720]
In response to a recent column about WQAms struggle to find a viable long-term morning show

[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:49.360]
Dolphins radio announcer Howard David called mean called very jackass to defend his record and insist he will continue doing a

[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.920]
Talk show at least through the end of his contract in the spring of 2006

[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.700]
Absolutely

[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:59.700]
David points out that in the most recent ratings book he and Steve Geldey Goldstein generated a five point

[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:08.520]
Oh, share between six and eight a.m. among the key mailed 25 to 54 demographic group topping the 3.6 to do was generated a year earlier in that slot

[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.100]
In that slot, welcome

[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:16.700]
While fired 8 to 10 a.m. Host Scott for all deserves a lot of credit especially an attracting younger audience

[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:23.440]
What we did between 6 and 8 with detractors in our own radio station is something I'm proud of said David who called a syndicated Minnesota

[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.360]
St. Louis game Sunday on WQM and made many mistakes

[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:33.920]
WQM is hopeful convincing Joe Rose to handle the 8 to 10 a.m. slot with Goldstein says

[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.580]
Barry jackass. How do you like that?

[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.420]
Yeah, huh he tractors in the radio station

[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:46.880]
Like mom sure he means us but generally like everybody because he's used to taking it up the body from everybody in the building

[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.780]
You know on sand I like take a lot

[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.780]
Hey, Geldey just bug off for you

[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.260]
God, hey, that's a good looking guy. Okay, Kanda

[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.560]
Joe Rose and Geldey where they had they too happened to be buddies to begin with in fact

[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:05.060]
It was Joe that brought squeaky geldey into the worst team in the in the first place which created at the time a lot of

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:11.340]
Well, I don't want to say a lot but a certain degree of conflict because it was always when there's three people involved in a project like that

[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.940]
Like three three people involved in partnership in a business

[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.180]
It's always two to one. I mean unless it's unanimous. It's always gonna be two against one

[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:24.780]
And in that case it was always Joe and Geldey against D.Fo poor D.Fo on the outside no wonder he went to the Indians and you know

[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.760]
Big for forgiveness or whatever the hell I was you see what I'm saying mm-hmm

[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.860]
So there's the it's not long. It's just a short piece in there

[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:37.420]
But there's some real interesting meat in the story there by Barry Jackass who was much of a lemming and a wheezyl in a simple

[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:42.800]
Then as he is and a little a mama's boy the fact that a matter is that he gets the inside poop because first of all

[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.320]
Mohawar David had called him which is embarrassing and secondly the thing about the Joe and Geldey

[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:53.860]
He knows because I'm sure that Greg told him that right right because he gets it right from the horses ass right from Greg

[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:57.500]
Right from our general mangler the Humpty Dumpty man

[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:02.300]
Who's sitting in there with Joe was right now rose right now talking turkey you can take that to the bank folks

[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:08.120]
They're sitting in their hammering it out their hammering it right now hammer turkey their hammering the old bird

[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:17.140]
But WQM is hopeful convincing Joe rose to handily eight to ten am slot with Goldstein the Joe and Geldey show the first team junior

[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:21.040]
Right right the first team junior

[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.160]
Oh

[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.140]
So there's the latest scuttle but from inside the never ending soap opera and that is

[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.940]
WQAM where we can never get all our toes on the ground and let me say it again for all you're a good guy

[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:39.680]
And it had a good time working with you was a blast even though you like a got a death wish

[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:45.040]
But the fact that a matter is when and we find out you're talking to Moe on the phone if I heard most voice on the phone

[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:50.900]
He didn't you know we hear right away. I give up. There you go sounds like a down code of me with a vehicle in it

[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.380]
You're being a detractor. Yeah another deal. What is that line he used again?

[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:01.800]
What we did between six and eight with detractors no one radio station is something I'm proud of

[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.400]
This is the same guy who very shortly after he started his morning abortion on his station

[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:11.660]
Erged his audience not to listen to the show that followed him and he's talking about detractors on the station

[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.660]
How are you kidding you back stabbing phony old kite?

[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.200]
How are you kidding man besides? I thought they had detractors on the farm. Yeah, right

[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.580]
The detractors are out in the yard trying to clear it away for your bag to scrape through there God

[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.640]
What a piece of third

[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:33.440]
10 39 21 to 11 at 5 60. Let's take a look at this number from up me gill our

[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.380]
Best-up campaign as of December 2nd as of today

[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.100]
42,905 bucks where the 220 come from

[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.560]
Weekend cash that he had encountered great

[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.260]
So we're almost to 43 grand and we'll make that 50 because we got the home of the December to go in its holidays

[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:55.740]
And if you want your best in the old CD for your kids and your uncle and your cousin and your mama and whoever else

[00:32:55.740 --> 00:33:01.920]
Now's the time to get it you can go online and do that and also be having a van hit at some random places as there

[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:07.320]
They come to which I'm pleased to see that finally and meaning a place that we can choose that somebody might actually show up as

[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:13.840]
As opposed to Ed's shoe shine shop on a corner of a or maybe shoe Steve shoe shine stand on a corner

[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.700]
Biscayne in the 79th Street, you know

[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.600]
Our audience probably in hanging out too much or something maybe to pick up a hooker where I ran out then

[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.700]
I'm probably not during this show

[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.640]
So we got nearly 43 grand 4 2 9 0 5 or a band and pay rescue wait till we get to that normal Kent story

[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.600]
He ought to be putting the big check in there. I'll guarantee you that and

[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.940]
He's certainly I can be charging me for his services no more after after emailing me frantically

[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:42.600]
This morning to make sure I see that story from the Miami Herald about how he sold the bag newspaper

[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:48.400]
I mean the express newspaper and he's gone from a hospital to the millionaire in just four years normal

[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.540]
And I'm sure that his show is going to be highly syndicated and popular all over the world

On the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority Neil God

[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.620]
And now from time squares studios

[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.340]
Barbara Waldo's

[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:21.240]
Good evening and welcome to 2020. I've interviewed Christopher Reed many times since the accident that paralyzed him eight years ago

[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:27.820]
But I wasn't prepared for the amazing achievement. I witnessed this time. I have never talked to you without

[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.960]
I've never done this in Vaughan. This is the first time

[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.560]
Something remarkable

[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.300]
My goodness isn't this interesting. This is the first time I've ever done this

[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:44.500]
A very important and that's our program for tonight. I thank you for joining us. I'm Robert Waldo's. I'll see you next week

[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.640]
If you realize how it looked. This is the first time

[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:57.500]
1046 at 560 W to QIM. I bet you got an eyeful. Anyway, a paid 60-yard post says big night for W and detestors

[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:02.000]
This a misplugged puts it on her own website, which is kind of amusing because it takes a little shot at her

[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.160]
She's probably fudge-packing right now curb your enthusiasm star David Larry

[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:14.900]
Larry David's wife Lori created an enviable buzz for a nice political powwow liberal Hollywood activist after she dubbed it the hate busher vent

[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.780]
To which we said all right

[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:24.600]
While the strategy session at the Beverly Hilton actually has the considerably less inflammatory title a mandatory meeting to change the leadership in America in 2004

[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:29.560]
Lori an avid environmentalist called a caused a stir when she forwarded invites with the email heading

[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.700]
Hate Bogey December 2nd event

[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:36.180]
Internet gossip miss Mack Fudge gleefully seized upon a hate-boge story yesterday

[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:42.040]
noting that the meeting will be chaired by Harold ickys bill Clintons former white house deputy chief of staff and Clinton

[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:48.060]
Gore campaign manager and Ellen Malcolm founder of Emily's list a group dedicated to reluctant pro-choice democratic women

[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:54.120]
former AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosen-Towell also chair according to an invited pain by paid six

[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:59.040]
But area manual founding partner of the powerful and debert talent agency brother of Clinton white house staff

[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:04.900]
Arama manual and agent Hillary david and westwing creator Aaron Sorkin bristle that the hate push all of blue people are

[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:10.500]
Assembly over a political issue the 2004 election manual told us I didn't know that free assembly was a bad thing

[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:14.240]
The invite didn't say hate push and I don't think the drudge story was productive

[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:19.760]
Manual to kind of say who will support but assure us it won't be pushed to which we say all right and not wouldn't either will we

[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.820]
Many many times

[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.640]
I just mentioned that in passing. What do we got percentage wise 21 and a half percent say it was a courageous thing

[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:34.100]
And then enough to make you want to puke yeah means there's 21 and a half percent of this audience that got sucked in or that

[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.720]
Dumber they're just a bunch of suckle fans or we're being freaked

[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:38.740]
Nah

[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:46.320]
We got a hundred to 181 votes. What was your take on George W Bush's surprise thanks giving visit to the troops in Iraq

[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.580]
It was a sorry-ass photo opportunity nothing more 93

[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.980]
51.3 percent it was clearly courageous designed to boost to bolster troop morale 39

[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.160]
21.5 percent and by the way

[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.520]
That's the wrong answer

[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:07.080]
It was strictly politics 21 why didn't he stay longer and see what is really happening 21

[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:11.480]
It was a brilliant way to upstage Hillary seven out of 181 vote now

[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:12.380]
now

[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.520]
Well, I was gonna read the normer Kent story because yeah, I'm sure he's listening to out there right now

[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.940]
Another self-aggrandizing silly person. I am listening WQ I am

[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.540]
Neil yes sir

[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:25.880]
How you doing?

[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.260]
I don't know if you've heard a yes-a but uh

[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:33.380]
General Park was in town yesterday. Have a little meeting over the end of this week

[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:38.320]
Sir, I'm gonna talk about that a little later on he said did you know that his father was Jewish?

[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:46.840]
I know that after that he attended an eight seminar and a synagogue that had over 600 people at attend it right and

[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.360]
And he did a very well job now. I

[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.120]
I haven't been a big fan of his but I figured I'd go and hear what he had to say and and he

[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.600]
He did a really good job

[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:01.000]
I think he's the one that might be able to beat push he never stole a freight train. I'll tell you that

[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.620]
No, and he might be able to get some of the right wingers to help the little to the left

[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:08.020]
But if I was him I wouldn't be uh well person Delray Beach. It's okay

[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.960]
But I wouldn't be announcing to the whole world too much

[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.680]
Especially in the deep south that his father was Jewish and about his Jewish roots. I'd be kind of keeping that quiet, you know

[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:15.860]
Uh

[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.940]
He's still a

[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.000]
Good-looking white guy

[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.320]
There you go. Good-looking white guy nothing wrong with that. Have a great taser. Good-looking white guy

[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:25.440]
Oh

[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.940]
What's wrong with the good-looking white guy? That's what I've always said

[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:36.500]
Over to the world. Well, I'll put that ahead of the Norma can't-story Clark Stumps for Jewish votes

[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:40.360]
Which explains I guess why he's been hanging out at the deli den in the rascal house

[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.100]
You know, he's got a little Jew in him

[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:49.980]
Delray Beach Connecticut Senator Joe Jew Lieberman may have been in the sentimental favorite in south-thode after

[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.380]
a few thousand butterfly ballots

[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.520]
prevented him from becoming vice president in 2000

[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.360]
But he why I think it would be appropriate if he were the vice president

[00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.120]
Or are

[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.480]
But he wasn't the presidential candidate during a standing rowdy crowd in a synagogue in Delray Beach yesterday

[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:09.380]
Retired army general Wesley Clark stepped into Jew Lieberman country drunk hundreds here

[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.000]
I'm talking about his Jewish roots and his support for Israel

[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:19.300]
The general who's come under fire from Lieberman and his other democratic rivals for shifting stances on the Iraq war and his

[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:24.920]
Pass support for more public wounds left little doubt about his goal when a woman stood up to ask how he can rid the field of these spoilers

[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.820]
Who stand between him and the nomination?

[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:31.600]
I think she's talking about Senator Lieberman Clark boomed into the microphone at Temple MF

[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.240]
MF it was you think it was the MF

[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:40.400]
Maybe he's got a speech defect later speaking to reporters Clark called his comment a joke

[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:46.500]
But it underscored the developing rivalry between the two contenders who both decided to skip the January 19th Iowa caucuses

[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:52.800]
Now watch it listen to this they plan to focus on winning other primaries in later weeks in more moderate states like South Carolina

[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.140]
Oklahoma and Arizona

[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.600]
Now the idea that you Lieberman is gonna win

[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.480]
Votes in South Carolina Oklahoma and Arizona is so

[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:10.000]
Yeah, Wesley Tarkyo. No question about it more moderate states like South Carolina more moderate states right like South Carolina

[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:12.960]
Oklahoma

[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:15.480]
and

[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.460]
The hotbed of Irby Wright wing financial organization that's been kicked out of California, Arizona

[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.560]
More moderate states, which I think tells you a lot about the fascist USA right there

[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:29.620]
If those in a moderate states, I'd hate to see which ones that a extreme right wing ones

[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:36.280]
Clark and Lieberman along with North Carolina Senator John Edwards, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry and Missouri representative

[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:42.680]
Gebhardt are vying to survive the primaries long enough to challenge former Vermont governor Howard Dean who leads in polls and federal raising and did nice

[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.260]
I didn't see the whole thing on last night on

[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.880]
What is that stupid show hardballs with Chris Matthews?

[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.600]
And why do they always have to start with a gay marriage thing?

[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.320]
You know, it always have to go to a big song to dance and it has to ask the same question 50 million times

[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:01.180]
And Howard Dean says what differences to make when you call it whether it's civil union or marriage

[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:08.300]
It means exactly what Wesley Clark said last week full and equal rights for everybody period whatever to have you call it

[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:14.200]
And I think that those people are insisting on you know back in anybody in a corner about the you know what you call it a marriage

[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.220]
Well, what's how difference does it make what you call it call it Fred

[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.680]
Most marriages in America are fraud anyway, so who now cares

[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:22.300]
Anyway

[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:28.700]
The Florida primary said for March 9 while the nominees expected to be decided with a flurry of big-state primaries on March 2

[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:36.300]
Strategies for some campaigns believe the Florida vote could prove a decisive vote if a legitimate challenger to Dean emerges and the nomination remains in doubt

[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:42.480]
All nine Democrats trying to attend the state's Democratic Party Convention this weekend in anxious Orlando

[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.860]
Most of the candidates have devoted time to raising money at private events in Florida

[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:50.720]
Among them is Clark who collected about a hundred grand at the private Miami fundraiser Monday night

[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:54.540]
But he also made it repeated public appearances. He is right now. Here's the part I like

[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.740]
He's rallied crowds in Jewish delis and Hollywood and Sonny Isles

[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.640]
A.K.A. the deli-den and the rascal house

[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:07.960]
Oi and money just to show that he's one of them. He actually stuffed a few bagels into a sack. He brought a lot

[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:13.460]
Yeah, he stuffed some sweet and low in a couple of bagels and a couple of dill pickles into a sack that is

[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:15.840]
He's brought him the ziplock bag right

[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:22.940]
Monday he once again would a constituency that most experts earlier believed belonged to Lieberman orthodox Jew who struggled in the polls

[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.980]
The crowd applauded Clark Monday. Has he tried to present a bush for his handling a post-war rack?

[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.220]
Clark promised a new more internationalized approach to foreign policy

[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:37.020]
He spoke of learning laden life that his father who died when Clark was three was Jewish and a native of Minsk

[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:40.260]
Belarus you don't where my grandmother was from Minsk Minsk

[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:47.000]
Oh, you're like that Anna Solomon. They could have been kin my man Wesley Clark my man

[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:53.680]
He spoke of his first visit to Israel in 1976 and of evening. He shared with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabina

[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.020]
I wonder if he said Yitzhak

[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.260]
What I would have that would have done good you know got him a lot of extra votes

[00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:58.720]
Mm-hmm

[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:02.520]
Plus he'd have been given out free brisket and potato lockies couldn't hurt

[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:07.120]
I was overjoyed and thrilled and happy Clark said of learning of his ties to Judaism

[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:12.780]
I'm so proud of my Jewish family and my Jewish heritage. I just want he started sound like barber sterling now

[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:19.220]
I just love Israel the Jewish people the Jewish people I love Israel. Ain't I remember her no that bitch that slut now?

[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.840]
I just wanted to share it with you. He said to the all Jewish crowd

[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:29.800]
Now wait until he goes to one of those southern baptist churches and he tells him that he was his father was black

[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:36.200]
I mean he died when he was three. He's busy. He's been spending a lot of time checking out his family roots

[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:43.600]
Okay, maybe he'll find out his his and then yeah, and he comes to South Florida to date county and everybody finds out his father was

[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:50.540]
Cuban. Hey, it can be done his father was a philasha who integrated the Cuba father or Goulache's in Minsk

[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:58.680]
Well, the opera general support for a piece in the Middle East talk has been criticized for a vagueness on issues was less direct on the issue

[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:06.020]
He called the Bush administration's approach to the Middle East half-hearted city supports Israel's right to establish security through preemptive strikes

[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:10.060]
Uh-oh, but as for the fence being constructed by Israel and the West Bank Clark caution

[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.600]
You've got to be very mindful of the Palestinians rights

[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:17.120]
You don't want to construct a fence that's going to be prejudicial for the ultimate ability to resolve the problems to negotiations

[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.000]
Yadi Yadi

[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:25.660]
Local Democratic leader said yesterday the turnout for Clark illustrates potential weaknesses for Lieberman's campaign

[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:28.440]
All right, and what was once considered a stronghold

[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:34.820]
This demonstrates there's an opening for someone else to galvanize supports in state Democratic Senate the Democratic leader Ron Klein

[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.820]
A Palm Beach County Democrat who went with Clark on Monday

[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.600]
Palm Beach County Commissioner Bert Erinzen and Lieberman supporter

[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:44.180]
Conceded that the Clark turnout was impressive though. We said Lieberman could match it

[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:49.000]
Let's put it this way Erinzen said I don't know if Senator Lieberman's campaign's been disappointing or the other ones have just been

[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.520]
Better wow. That's an interesting way of looking at it right sure

[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:53.720]
Yeah

[00:45:54.660 --> 00:46:00.020]
In other words if a restaurant goes out of business, it's like saying I don't know if their food was really crappy or maybe the other restaurants were just

[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:00.840]
Better

[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:01.660]
Say

[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.160]
Yeah, that's a good way of looking at it

[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:09.480]
I don't know if our radio station was garbage or if the other ones were just better

[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.760]
That's what the David Ross is always saying to PD Bulger

[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.760]
I don't know if the uh

[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:18.900]
Clear channel stations suck or if the other ones just happen to be better they suck less they suck less

[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:23.100]
That's gonna be our new motto with QA we suck less except mid days where he sucks a lot

[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:31.940]
1056 I'm so excited about Joe Rose's performance give him a big raise. Okay. Give him whatever he wants Greg

[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:35.440]
I'm listening. Yeah, he sliced Moapa on ass

[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.940]
This morning about that very jackass conversation

[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:42.880]
You think that an old fart like him up there in Boka between a majong and a golfer

[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.820]
That's some more productive to do than sitting around calling the very jackass trying to defend himself

[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.240]
Oh, man. Yeah

[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:54.100]
See if he didn't have it in through early complex another show sucks in his boring itself

[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:59.400]
He would have to be called very jackass. Well, we had a five point. Oh, and it's fun to the attractors on the station

[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.140]
I'm very proud of that. Yeah, you're proud

[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:02.060]
Yamama

Because she is really a sweetheart. We like her a lot

And you'll like yourself a lot more when you look in the mirror and you realize that the weight is pouring off your body

[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:24.440]
Thanks to balance for life the reason that she's doing so well is because it's easy

[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.620]
You don't have to count carbohydrates. You don't have to count calories

[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:31.480]
You don't have to do anything other than reach outside you during reach for the sack

[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.360]
Lot of you people out there have a lot of experience reaching for the sack

[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.460]
There's a chance to make something productive out of it reach for your black sack

You way up

[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.320]
If Larry King and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers

[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:46.320]
I'm the happiest son of a bitch in the world

[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:54.560]
One mentions my name I'm ecstatic that they have forgotten and laid

[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:01.260]
I'm the happiest son of a bitch in the world

[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:10.520]
After and once you're left I went out of the lamp but I don't have to run anymore

[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:15.360]
I'm just about to fight out of my fancy wall of my fellow

[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.700]
Blinking not see home

[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.020]
I'm the slap

[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:21.080]
The

[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:31.820]
After pissing away all those 401k who says grind doesn't

[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:37.400]
As your people never resaid

[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.640]
Can you lay with just like you say

[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:44.600]
I'm the happiest son of a bitch

[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:46.680]
In the world

[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:55.800]
Take off those checkered pants. I'm no three at five sixty. He's everywhere. You know it

[00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:02.300]
Oh, yeah, he just gets under your skin so to speak the molemyster man. I'm trying his big day is coming. Oh soon

[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.920]
Very jackass rodda think about him yesterday in the herald and case you missed it. Oh, I did read it

[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.620]
hahaha

[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:16.940]
That's right. I'm a detractor and George is detractor and Josh don't know but he's a detractor

[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.120]
Joshua the Combine

[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:25.440]
And then you got to dr. Rose is a big detractor and Amanda was also a closet detractor because he got to work with him on the games

[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:30.480]
but he hates it and he got guilty who's not he's out of the closet detractor now and

[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:34.080]
A humber who's a very very much out of the closet detractor

[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.120]
Who else who might we even out?

[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.000]
Anybody else that we anybody else we haven't mentioned yet?

[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.340]
I'll go get the QAM extension list and you can get that.

[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.920]
Here's the roster even the janitors in the tractor.

[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:47.620]
Absolutely.

[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:48.000]

[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:51.880]
In the building and it's quite a bet we got a 5.0 and I'm very proud of that.

[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:55.440]
And it's one in little Savannah and he got a bunch of diaries and yeah, yeah right.

[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:56.860]
Whatever the hell it was.

[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:58.280]
God.

[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:03.260]
And see one of the big differences between the fact that this show is entertaining

[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:07.580]
and we have a gigantic audience and that one is the fact that we don't discourage you from listening.

[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:10.820]
We encourage you to listen to the more Howard David had show while it's still on.

[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:11.340]
Right.

[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:12.020]
Right.

[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:17.700]
Right because we want the entire station to do well even if only for the fact that we like to get our bonus money see.

[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.900]
Because that you really don't have a choice.

[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.260]
You have to be a team player.

[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:26.440]
You can't be a detractor because you know because it's like shooting yourself in a foot.

[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:31.520]
We want that bonus money in addition to which we encourage you to listen to more because then you'll find out

[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:37.340]
that you won a little Havana and start a ring Steve and all the other chronic colors you'll find out what is we're talking about all the time.

[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.640]
And you'll say holy crap he's got a good point and so does Joe Rose.

[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.460]
He's got a good point on top of that gigantic head.

[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.400]
Here's our first poll today.

[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:51.020]
What was your take on George W. Bush's surprise Thanksgiving visit to the troops in Iraq?

[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.080]
255 votes.

[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.220]
It was a sorry ass photo up nothing more 128.

[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:06.560]
It was clearly courageous design of bolster troop morale just changed again 50 131 on the first one 50% out of 262.

[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:11.560]
It was clearly courageous design of bolster troop morale 55 20.9%.

[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.680]
That number is dwindling.

[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.520]
It's dwindling.

[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.240]
It was strictly politics 36.

[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.500]
Why didn't he stay longer and see what's really happening in Iraq has got.

[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:25.800]
And it was a brilliant way to upstage Hillary 10 out of 262.

[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:30.060]
I think we ought to take a collar too because I got a pile of stuff here man.

[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.100]
Now we got that second poll later on we got a heavy duck it today.

[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:34.000]

[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:35.740]

Listen.

[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.260]
That's bad news for you.

[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:49.840]
Yeah.

[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:50.980]
That's bad news for you.

[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:51.900]
I like it.

[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:52.100]
Okay.

[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:53.740]

[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:55.440]
You're Washington?

[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:56.560]
Yeah.

[00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:58.920]

[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:05.160]

[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:05.360]

[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:08.960]
No.

[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:11.220]
5670560.

[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:12.760]
Well, at least they're getting some new material now.

[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:12.960]
Good.

[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:13.020]
Yeah.

[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:14.300]
I guess you get to the new year.

[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:17.060]
I like how he didn't put the fake boys on until he knew he was on the air.

[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:17.440]
Right.

[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:21.900]
And speaking of the retired guy, I guess what we got coming up in the second poll in the last

[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:22.640]

A list of people who you think ought to be terror like right away.

[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.560]
Which one of these people might want to tip the thing?

[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:32.420]
I don't want to tip it.

[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:35.160]
I don't want to be like a tippy headroom for the birds.

[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.340]
Oh, look at what's ringing now.

[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:39.260]
You don't think it's really working, do you?

[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:40.980]

[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:41.540]

[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:45.100]
No, Neil.

[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.440]

[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:49.780]
The Al Franken.

[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.140]
Get out of town.

[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:52.700]

[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:55.260]
No, it's not.

[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.900]
It's the different guy.

[00:53:58.300 --> 00:53:59.440]
No, you're probably that guy's boyfriend.

[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:02.680]
Let me ask you a question.

[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:06.260]
Did you see the beating of this big black guy in Cincinnati that died?

[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:07.520]
No, I didn't.

[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:08.920]
You haven't seen that on the news.

[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.460]
They've shown it 50 million times.

[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:11.320]

whatever station i appear on doing my cmbc businessmen at every day

[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:52.840]
what's the same

[00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:55.980]
a m station's up to the fourteen hundred or whatever

[00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:00.500]
that's what he doesn't even know the call that is that's a person

[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:03.280]
signal about two and a half the noon that's humiliating

[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.240]
uh... the i honest your closes up the

[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:08.980]
i don't want to say that the people at cmbc are caving into the right wing

[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:10.240]
but i will say this

[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.440]
that would have market going up the last few days here they they have the

[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.280]
heading you got that one ball hit a smoker on and said about some other

[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.100]
guy that comes on here

[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:20.400]
and the heading says it's the economy it should say

[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:23.680]
it's the economy stupid because really what you people are trying to say

[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.460]
say the economy's making a nice comeback

[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:28.340]
uh... support el bush march to that's what they're really trying to say to

[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.000]
create the is

[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.780]
g is doing the same thing like by a common all the others

[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:34.720]
they're crap in their pants the cow to the right way you know that

[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.920]
well you can say it but i got to tell you and if i told you this before

[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:40.840]
not everybody i have routinely asked all my guess

[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:44.700]
you know the president face to issue the head of the selection the economy and

[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:46.460]
the rock war everywhere expected

[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:49.540]
that the war would not be the issue in the economy would be

[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.780]
well what happened it's not the economy

[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:52.820]
it's the war

[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:55.540]
so what about that how come

[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:59.060]
why don't you ask your producers there at cnbc at the gambling channel

[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:01.840]
asked them how come you keep putting up this uh... thing at the bottom of my

[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.200]
screen it's as it's the economy

[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.740]
put up it's the war stupid or something like that

[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:06.780]
really good

[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:10.980]
i don't think that kind of on the purpose of that is to uh... indicate what the

[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:11.340]
the

[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.520]
failure point around the election is that right

[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:19.240]
it's basically just what we're talking about any given moments obvious to me

[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.900]
you made some bad investments because from the sounds of this you still need

[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:22.320]
the job

[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:24.700]

[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.220]
not that we want to get anybody a little bit nervous out there

[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:29.820]
but it's about time so he started paying attention

[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:30.800]
you mean more safer

[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:36.660]
a lack of international cooperation and resolve is holding back efforts to

[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.900]
stand the flow of money arms and supporters

[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.080]
to al-Qaeda

[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.300]
a u-want report has warned

[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:45.620]
as a result of the uh... tear network

[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:49.220]
blame for the an i-level attacks on the west's continue to let me try it

[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:52.560]
again as a result the tear network blame for these nine-level attacks on the

[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.600]
west's continuing to grow

[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.700]
the other act in particular becoming a fertile ground now keep in mind again

[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.460]
that iraq wasn't a fertile ground

[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:05.160]
very pretty much iraq attack by the bushmeister and his abandoned very not

[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.900]
these but now all of a sudden iraq is becoming a fertile ground for terrorism

[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:12.260]
that they use a lot of the supposed to be fighting but instead we're helping to

[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:12.960]
create it

[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.220]
felling the flames

[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.840]
so stoking a hornet's nest

[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.500]
put were stoking and poking it

[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.000]
the report released yesterday was compiled by a special security council

[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.940]
committee established a monitor international sanctions against al-Qaeda

[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:29.240]
especially worrisome for the west-led forces in a rick

[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:34.560]
the committee said that country had become readily accessible to al-Qaeda followers

[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.700]
anxious to take up the battle against the coalition forces it's become like a

[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:39.740]
maggot magnet

[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:44.620]
kind of like u.a.m. a maggot magnet kind of like the mohari david at show a

[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:45.580]
maggot magnet

[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:46.900]
right one

[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:51.720]
it added the risk of the terror group requiring and using weapons of mass

[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:55.300]
destruction continued to grow highlighting great concern over the possibility

[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:58.740]
the group might stay in attack by using a so-called dirty bomb

[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:03.060]
the committee headed by Chile and ambassador heraldo munoz

[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:06.360]
mounted no relation to many munoz monitors the implementation of security

[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:09.240]
council resolutions requiring specific action against al-Qaeda

[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.980]
among the measures passed by the council resolutions requiring countries to

[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:16.060]
identify al-Qaeda linked organizations and individuals imposed travel

[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:19.780]
restrictions freeze bank accounts and prevent their access to arms

[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:20.760]
etc. and so on

[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:25.480]
munoz said a particular concern is that many charities are still being

[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:29.020]
abused by groups connected to al-Qaeda or the former Taliban regime in

[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:29.600]
Afghanistan

[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.820]
this is a very distressing fact he said

[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:36.640]
furthermore he added weapons continue to flow across borders unchecked and in

[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:37.260]
large quantities

[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:41.060]
especially in the middle east as a result of reports that al-Qaeda continues to

[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:44.460]
have access to sufficient funds to recruit train and mount operations

[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:45.620]
they're mounting it right now

[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:46.820]
how do you like that

[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.580]
is this pathetic or what

[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:52.680]
just exactly what everybody knew was going to happen if they had a brain right

[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:56.680]
stoking a hornet that's what's going to happen or it's all going to fly out

[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.760]
they're going to start biting their everybody's ass and we got to us over here

[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.280]
baby we got big troubles

[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:07.080]
didn't take a genius to figure out that if they invaded directly to exactly

[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.580]
what Osama was challenging them to do but then again back to the hell of

[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:13.160]
the president's good for business he was only in a difting that we were

[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.480]
uh... going to be doing that

[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.900]
and if it's good for how about in good for uh... uh... uh... uh... with the

[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.940]
out of back to health and it's good for a decade if it's good for dick it's

[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:21.880]
good for business okay

[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.420]
because quite frankly they don't give a dick about anybody else beside

[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:28.120]
themselves in their good rich corporate friends which is why we had them

[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.960]
corporate tax cuts which supposedly are having that trickle down right now

[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:32.560]
down your leg

[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.680]
yet you feel it can you smell it that's the point

[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:40.880]
now that's that's his piece that he left behind on the chair and the bank

[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.540]
sorry about your chair speaking of that

[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:44.940]
what happened to my chair on trickling down into it

[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.820]
that's okay bring Randy back she'll swap it for the other one

[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:55.240]
now here's the normal can't story are we out of time no one actually have

[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.040]
been to two for this

[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.880]
because i'll be a lot of important calls coming in

[01:07:59.380 --> 01:07:59.780]
wq

[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:02.640]
now here's the overcamps story are we out of time

[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.980]
and actually a bit of it

[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.600]
there's a lot of important calls coming in

[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.180]
now here's the overcamps story are we out of time

[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:12.600]
here's the two positions

[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.100]
you have a lot of expenses we've done a time tunnel

[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.060]
here's the next

[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:20.660]
here's Neil

[01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:23.760]

[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:38.520]
right

[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.340]
and uh... michael not michael more

[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:42.260]
i'm franken was on the span two

[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.420]
booktv on Saturday morning

[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.140]
at uh... university in chicago

[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:47.620]
right

[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:50.820]
ripping uh... gpev you a new uh... you know what

[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:51.680]
everybody

[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:56.120]
okay thanks and have a great day

[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.100]
he was having difficulty getting his thoughts together

[01:08:59.100 --> 01:08:59.360]
okay

[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.580]
but he was he was good he had a good point to make there but uh... what was it

[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:05.760]
that uh... bush is an asshole and we agree with that

[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:09.800]
let's see twenty one point six percent said that it was a courageous uh... act

[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.640]
yeah design a bolster troop around

[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.460]
no question about it

[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:16.160]
that's why he kept looking at that radar when that british airways thinking

[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.940]
within fifty million miles he's a oh i think we better hide the fact that

[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:22.520]
taxes to the ranch and i come on as a president that's not do that

[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.580]
and you know the interesting thing of it is

[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.780]
if they had turned around and stop and think about this

[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:31.960]
uh... had they turned around and gone back because they perceive there was some

[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:32.560]
kind of a threat

[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.160]
yeah

[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:36.460]
you think that we ever would have known that they left in the first place

[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:40.380]
no something to ponder something to think about

[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:44.640]
my life and look up this is four-twenty-o-five city

[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.480]

saw it on the TV

[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:20.020]
the planning more attacks

[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:25.420]

[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:27.980]

[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:31.120]

happy Tuesday

[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:53.860]
December number two

[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:57.080]
this is the day we put the pieces of our lives back together again after this

[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.000]
Thanksgiving business

[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.660]
although you know i did make that trip to Montreal but it was no thanks given here

[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:03.800]
because we already had our Thanksgiving in October a

[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:05.300]
year

[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:05.740]
and you like that

[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:07.640]
but i will say again

[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:12.180]
and the people in Montreal are all ugly number one of the food is fabulous

[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:18.180]
seriously if you just if you'd like go on a fast for like two weeks and you lose a lot of weight

[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.560]
and you just want to fill that hole again

[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:21.400]
that's the place to go

[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.180]
i want to fill that hole

[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:23.700]
that's what i heard

[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:25.140]
that's what Josh told me

[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:26.120]
anyway

[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.040]
we got the mad dog coming along

[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:31.100]
to the saffrono and Jim managed the wildly popular

[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:33.620]
the ever popular the indefatigable what is that

[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:34.740]
Jim managed it to

[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:36.620]
the hunt for it for in the studio no

[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:39.000]
for three thousand hours

[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.500]
oh look who we got out of seven o'clock tonight did you notice that

[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:42.640]
no i don't read this thing

[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.180]
did you look at the schedule

[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:45.240]
let me give you a clue

[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.160]
the beast

[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.840]
now maybe they're starting to take a little page

[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:53.400]
i doubt it probably the big oz on vacation or something like that

[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.460]
but i noticed i don't see the big on the schedule this week

[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:57.600]
i love eating nuts

[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.480]
remember what i said last week about how come we don't give some of the other people

[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:03.940]
a little of our own time like they've hegged maybe i heard a stevenson

[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:13.500]
hurricane warm up 730

[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.540]
eight o'clock the stetson had her

[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:18.200]
and the hurricane's a basketball game

[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.420]
eighty k after the basketball game and you'll mark overnight

[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:23.480]
followed by the followed by the wildly unpopular

[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:24.660]
absolutely

[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:28.280]

but first the n h l which had a the franchise which had a negative cash flow

[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:00.400]
and fiscal year two thousand two must convince the broward kind of commission

[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.320]
that it's worthy of refinancing not only for million dollars in bonds

[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:06.740]
the commission authorized ninety six to build a center team plan to present its

[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:08.660]
uh... plans that today's commission meeting

[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.820]

[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:32.000]
the box for the newspapers the next day

[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.860]
does it mean that you made any money does it mean that there really sixteen

[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:38.660]
thousand people there does it mean that uh... you it's a viable uh... no

[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:40.660]
wow

[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:45.220]
county finance director philip alan stopping sure to give an opinion on the plan

[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:47.980]
said yesterday that he had concerns about refinancing the debt

[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:51.080]
among them that the team's fan base isn't growing

[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:56.240]
that soft lores a non-traditional market for hockey that two other n h l teams

[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.660]
have already sought refuge in bankruptcy court this year

[01:15:58.660 --> 01:15:59.840]
ten with the sabers

[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:03.920]
and that a potential workstoppage looms as the least collective bargaining are

[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.180]
greenwood it's place that the expire after this season

[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:09.700]
here comes the line of the century all you hockey fans out there i want to

[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:10.520]
pee on your parade

[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:14.080]
what i just saying yesterday i don't understand how we have a hockey team in

[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.840]
south Florida what was i just saying something along those lines

[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:21.960]
the concern is a potential bankruptcy of panthers hockey l l p

[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:26.620]
the partnership that owns the team alan said this is philipsy alan alan

[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:27.200]
co-in

[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:31.460]
plus he said the current proposal could make it more expensive for the county

[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:34.300]
to be fine and for the arena should the team cease to exist

[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.300]
the club itself is very concerned about its ability remain in business if it

[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:39.860]
doesn't generate sufficient cash flow

[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:42.980]
the panthers reported negative cash flow of seventeen and a half million

[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:45.960]
dollars in financial results for the year-end in june thirty of two thousand

[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:49.000]
to the most recent provided the county and it's got to be worth the year after

[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:49.260]
that

[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:54.720]
but michael your mark the panthers chief operating officer said the threat was

[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.840]
overstated the viability of this team is not even an issue we said we're

[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:01.640]
confident this organization is going to continue to move forward and thrive in

[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:02.300]
south florida

[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:05.640]
alan doesn't think the panthers financial performances improve much in

[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:06.760]
latest fiscal year either

[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:10.160]
i think they're having significant cash flow defuble easy said

[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.580]
your mark hired justly in late September said he could provide the latest

[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:14.960]
numbers

[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:19.600]

that for all debacle it it was it was uh... not good

[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.480]
as usual they find another way to keep sticking to us just when we think we

[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.380]
have some moe

[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:17.840]

[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:42.760]
percent

it was clearly courageous designed a bolster troop morale eighty two

[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.400]
twenty point eight percent

[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:51.320]
it was strictly politics fifty five

Gary says I was listening to Joe Rose this morning. Well, thank God for that Gary. We love Joe Rose

[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:03.080]
Beast, however, who were not too crazy about was doing the updates

[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:06.760]
It says on at least two occasions. He said the jet speed the Jaguars

[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:11.440]
21 to 17 the jacks the jets actually beat the Titans last night

[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:15.900]
Yeah, Tennessee Titans, you know as opposed to Jacksonville Jaguar as you idiot beast mr. Sports expert

[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.540]
Tell beast to get it right get it right beast

[01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:22.380]
There's nothing more aggravating than a sports station where they can't get the teams right

[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:25.880]
Thanks. No, thank you Gary's for pointing out to the beast. Well, he's under a lot of pressure

[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:30.940]
Because he's he's a scared of the fact that he knows Gilles going on with Joe from eight to ten

[01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:34.980]
He's a scared of the fact they're gonna try to shove his ass back in there with Mo again between five and eight

[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:41.180]
Which means he'd have to drag his fat ass out of bed like 3.34 o'clock at a morning number one and number two

[01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:46.320]
He'd have to go back in there with the dreaded one absolutely probably like you know waxes peace every day for him too

[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.340]
Jackson victim the real story

[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:56.920]
The boy accusing Michael Jackson Mola station says the king of popped of nude photos of him evidence that could put Michael behind bars for years

[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:02.340]
Oh right the youngster who was 12 at the time of the alleged crimes also charges Jackson showed in pornographic

[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:04.080]
Video tapes during his overnight

[01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:09.480]
Stays at Neverland Ranch is source close to the police investigation told the inquirer exclusively

[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:13.980]
Now if there's anybody that wants to poopoo the inquirer by the way if I can interrupt my reading here momentarily

[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:16.660]
Keep in mind that these were the same ones that gave us the

[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:20.640]
Rush story right on target. I think that was the beginning of of

[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.440]
Forels downfall remember it's right

[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.300]
He was doubted me for reading the inquirer on the air

[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:28.520]
That's it to keep it mine. It's in the inquirer and

[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.980]
Like 10 minutes later rush was already in the Arizona rehab

[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:33.280]
Anyway

[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:40.180]
The inquirer launched its own massive investigation and uncovered startling secrets behind the youngsters sleepovers with Michael

[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:44.300]
Starling evidence police discovered during multiple raids and explosive

[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:47.200]
Confrontations between the boys mother and the singer

[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:50.780]
We discovered a bizarre relationship exploded

[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:53.400]
Scored squirt no not that kind of explosion

[01:27:53.400 --> 01:28:02.380]
Exploded during a terrifying standoff that lasted for hours when the mother felt she was being held hostage by Michael and made a late-night escape from his ranch

[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:04.080]
A late night escape

[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:11.260]
The relationship ended for good when the mom blew up at Michael after being told he served her cancer stricken son wine

[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:12.580]
Which could have killed him

[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:18.840]
As law enforcement officials in Santa Barbara, California conducted their own criminal probe our news team

[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:24.680]
This is the inquirer our news team pieced together the alleged victims horrifying story and found out what really happened

[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:30.860]
We learned that in addition to the November 18 rate in Neverland police also seized videos from the home of a West Hills

[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:38.240]
California videographer showing Jackson with kids in various places and in a blockbuster disclosure the source posted investigation revealed

[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:45.440]
Police seized several secret videos during their multiple raids connected to the Jackson case now the cops are going to try to match these secret videos with

[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:52.360]
Descriptions that the alleged victim gave them he was able to give very specific details about what happened where it happened and how it happened

[01:28:53.480 --> 01:29:00.000]
Evidence was gathered from locations where the boy described inappropriate contact and other things he'd encountered you call that a penis

[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.820]
The boy also said that Michael Jackson took new photographs of him and then Michael showed him adult pornographic tapes

[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:14.460]
He described the pictures he says Michael took they would be in the smoking gun in this case you ready for that okay the smoking gun

[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:18.740]
Shockingly boy, let's get it. I'm just I'm on the edge of my seat

[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:25.100]
Shockingly the source says cops also found material related to SNM. Oi

[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:31.240]
See told a kid he was going in for some M&M's and it turned out it was a little SNM

[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:37.220]
The Youngster at the center of the whirlwind was treated at a hospital Los Angeles for leukemia

[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.940]
He was an overnight guest at Jackson's

[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:45.700]
2700 acre neverland ran several times last winter and was even featured in that controversial TV documentary about Jackson

[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.960]
To learn more about the boys background see the store on page 21. You're gonna see it?

[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:56.040]
Yeah, well the answer initially my Jackson thanks to the big heart of a comedy club owner who runs a program for underprivileged

[01:29:56.040 --> 01:30:02.560]
Children and through a fundraiser for the boy one of the boys request was to go to Neverland and meet Michael reveal a source close to the family

[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:09.120]
Arrangements were made and at first the boy in his family enjoyed Michael's hospitality the singer even helped with the medical expenses

[01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:17.780]
During one visit a British documentary crew taped Michael holding the boys hand as the two talked about sharing Jackson's Neverland bedroom

[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.200]
Sounds kind of fade to me

[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:28.640]
But serious trouble began brewing because Michael kept the boy and his mother apart during visits a Neverland employee told the inquire in an exclusive interview

[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:32.360]
She normally stayed in one of the guest suites near the lake on a property

[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:36.340]
Mothers would never be permitted in the main house while Michael had children in his bedroom

[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:39.060]
One night for whatever reason

[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.440]
The boys mother left the guest quarters and made her way to the main house in the middle of the night she was upset

[01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:51.260]
There are sensors and alarms in the hallway leading the Michael's bedroom suite and he also had live video security camera

[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:53.560]
So we could see who was coming down the hall to his bedroom

[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:59.140]
The boys mother banged on all the doors and made it to Michael's bedroom. Where's my son?

[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:04.380]
She cried the doors are always open except Michael's room when Michael goes in the room. He locks the door

[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:09.100]
The boys mother wanted to know what was going on inside the bedroom or her son was sleeping with Michael

[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:12.120]
She calmed down but Michael must have been wary after that

[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:17.520]
This past February the uneasy relationship between Michael and the cancer victims mother took a turn for the worse

[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:22.360]
Now keep in mind the timing of this because the tape you know that his own smoking gun

[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:26.740]
They've got a thing on it here too about the videotape where she said he never stole a freight train and treated him

[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:27.380]
Yadi Yadi

[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:30.800]
You know what that was made? I don't know not that late

[01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:31.820]
February

[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:39.560]
This past February the uneasy relationship between Michael and the cancer victims mother took a turn for the worst

[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:45.220]
That's when the documentary shot by British filmmakers here on ABC and the officer was punched in a nightmare of public ridicule

[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:49.180]
The poor boy was poked fun at relentlessly by a schoolmates in Los Angeles

[01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:56.120]
Disclose the source close to the family slurs like fagboy and gay boy were holding him by his cool peers reducing the tears and anger

[01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:58.280]
Someone even walked up to and said you mo

[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:02.440]
This put a great

[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:04.620]
Is he okay Josh?

[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:10.420]
Yeah, he's right this put a great strain on a relationship in the house between Michael and the mother and the boys

[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:16.300]
Brother and sister who sometimes accompanied them to never land then the mother was told by her son that Michael was giving him

[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:19.780]
Winded rink and she blew her stack on a visit to never land

[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:23.560]
How could you do that? Why would you do such a thing she yelled at him? He's a little boy

[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:30.580]
And he's on Carol a chemotherapy for his cancer. It's dangerous for any responsible to have someone drinking when they're on cancer treatments

[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:33.700]
They there can be very bad even fatal side effects

[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:36.880]
He said how do you like that? Yeah

[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:42.680]
Well, I mean and if anybody knows about getting somebody licked up George, right?

19.9 percent you see that fell under 20 percent

[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:10.200]
It was strictly politics 64

[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:15.200]
Why didn't he stay longer and see what's really happening 43 just like you don't want to see those flag-grade coffins

[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.540]
Oh, that's not good for morale, you know, right?

[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:23.720]
Bad PR's his morale and not good for his reelection and it was a brilliant way to upstage Hillary 18 out of 447

[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:27.020]
Okay, here's the second poll and I realized I'm interrupting my

[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:30.640]
Fabulous reading here of this fabulous Michael Jackson story, but nevertheless

[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:32.720]
poll number two

[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:37.160]
In fact, we can say that kind of trouble going back to his other voice

[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:42.460]
Maybe he's online too now anything wqm hey now yes, sir

[01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:45.360]
Can I take a moment to touch upon the story you read about the panthers?

[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:48.920]
Yes, just real quick because I know I don't want to kill anybody out there with this

[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:53.820]
It's my firm belief and I know how you feel about it because you said it already

[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:58.900]
When they took the panthers out of the division with the islanders and the rangers and the flyers

[01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:01.300]
I'm telling you it killed the crowd killed everything

[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:05.000]
It really did it's boring even though Atlanta

[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:10.020]
You don't think the fact that the team is not and by the way Atlanta's not drawn flies

[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:15.480]
I hate to read winter exciting team they're not drawn flies correct, but you don't think the fact that the team has

[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:18.240]
degraded essentially agreed that for the most part they've been

[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:22.940]
non-competitive for most of the years that they've been in new arena that that's got a lot to do with it plus the fact that

[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:27.660]
It's not a hockey town yet all those ingredients together plus the fact they never spent that 10 million dollars from

[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:29.500]
Pavel Breud that they've got to spend on freezes

[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:33.720]
There's not much of a draw there to bring people back right I can agree with that

[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:39.820]
Plus the constant increase in ticket prices that went through the roof to where like you got to pay 62 bucks for a good seat

[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:42.240]
Right all agreed, but let me just say this

[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:49.120]
You still have some sort of a fan base here from people who lived in the northeast and now we're facing every time you go to that arena

[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:56.120]
You're either seeing Carolina, Tampa or Atlanta who gives a crap about those teams or don't forget the horrible Washington

[01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:02.620]
Cancer who cares about their crap. Yeah, so I really I really believe that that was the beginning of the end when they were

[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:06.060]
Taken out of that division. I'm sorry. I really do yeah

[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:08.000]
It was a major hit for this team

[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.040]
Well, they're the survivor not there's still a lot of hockey fans down here

[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:16.620]
But other than seeing the panthers. There's nothing else that comes here nothing

[01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:21.060]
I know the Rangers come once maybe the Bruins come here one time that's it done

[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:22.900]
And the rest of the season blows

[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:26.240]
It's horrible. It's a shame and the arena's beautiful

[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:30.940]
And I sure hope that people keep this in mind even though I know they won't and I don't want to pee under parade in

[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:32.220]
Dayd County with their Marlon Stadium

[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:35.620]
But keep it in mind all that garbage about Wayne and if they build a new arena

[01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:39.120]
They're gonna have all this other revenue and they're gonna be able to compete and all this other crap

[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:42.880]
They've made the playoffs exactly one time since they've been in this new arena

[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:48.020]
It's highly unlikely that they're gonna make it again this year and uh, you know who now wants to pay for it

[01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:53.120]
I agree have a great thing. All right, buddy. Go. Let's go. Hey, okay. Yeah, sure

[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:59.420]
Hey, we still got it team. All right first place in the division briefly anyway

[01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:02.020]
See we got sidetracked on hockey there, but that was good

[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:07.880]
We've had all good calls there. I told you that you know what what did it what did it Joe Rose

[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:09.280]
I think you're right

[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:18.540]
Joe Rose at 9.59 this morning Joe. We love you. Maybe sign that contract sign to deal. He's waiting when he ripped a moment and ass

[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:26.080]
It was kind of like the green light. That was the signal to the entire South Florida audience that everything is

[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:29.040]
Okay, I say is proceeding post-haste

[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:31.180]
Hi, it's going Joe

[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:37.760]
Now that we got Joe in there with it see unlike for Ralph which we love for Ralph don't get me wrong now that he's got can

[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:40.600]
I'm not gonna like rip him an ass because that would be insincere, but

[01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:45.980]
He didn't know who his friends were and there was Mo and I I wouldn't try to influence him one way the other

[01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:51.180]
He could say whatever he wanted, but he just uh, you know, even though he did say Mo Show blows, which he's right about that

[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:57.540]
But Joe ain't gonna pull any punches about the moment. Okay, so Mo if you think that what was that term he used again about

[01:38:57.540 --> 01:38:57.780]
um

[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:00.140]
About

[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:04.600]
In spite of detractors in our own radio station

[01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:08.380]
We can't imagine who he was talking about there. Right

[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:15.860]
He got that five point. Oh, let me say it again. This is the same son of a bitch that went on the year and encouraged his list

[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:20.960]
There's not to listen to the show that follows him last year last summer the year goes summer

[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:27.120]
Would you to me? I never heard of such a thing. I never heard anybody on a radio station anywhere in the universe

[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:31.220]
Go on here and say I urge you not to listen to the station of the show that follows me or this one

[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:37.040]
Whoever heard a subscribe even though you're good friends back at iote like a dick feral and Alex Bennett they never stoop to that

[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:41.180]
They never stoop to it because it's not done. It's it's just isn't done

[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:47.720]
It's kind of like a Moa to be done. You know what I mean? Absolutely. Yeah done well done

[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:49.800]
Cook him well done. Okay

[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:54.080]
Anyway, well, and notice how we're getting sidetracked from this very important stuff

[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:57.420]
But the guy with a hockey call was good. I'm glad to see that there's somebody who cares which is good

[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:01.900]
And number two I want to get again tip my hat to Joe Rose not that I'm sucking up with Joe

[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:03.580]
I don't need to do that because we get along great

[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:06.060]
He is a little bit of a backstabber, but

[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:10.680]
I don't know why I say that I just say it because I like doing it. Yeah

[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:17.000]
I don't want to give anybody too much of an endorsement because then it's like it sounds insincere

[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.880]
All the audience hates that too. Yeah, oh, this audience can't stand that

[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:26.280]
If they think anybody's getting along too good then they're kind of like suspicious like you know the like the beast in clearance

[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:29.560]
They think there's something a little bit going on there. Is there yeah, there sure is

[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:34.280]
Parents was whining like a baby this morning over the Thanksgiving weekend

[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:38.480]
He didn't get anything from the beast even one. It's not even like a little thigh or leg

[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:41.040]
Okay, here's our second pool

[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:48.160]
Who would you most like to see retire already? In other words people that you think have just been around too damn long

[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:49.620]
hanging on

[01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:55.560]
Here's the list and you can add some to the list as we go on, but I don't know how many calls we have time for

[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:58.800]
I got a lot of heavy-duty crap including that big norm cat story

[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:06.060]
Who would you most like to see retire already retire Bob Barker

[01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:08.160]
Moe Howard Davided

[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.240]
Neo Rogers

[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:10.700]
Larry King

[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:12.120]
Jerry Lewis

[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.360]
Hey lady John Madden

[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:17.260]
Hank Goldberg or we just filled it

[01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:21.500]
Now the other reason I put the hopper on air is because I don't know because I figured if I'm gonna put me in Moe on air

[01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.160]
You know the other fad you

[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:28.140]
Yeah, I'm gonna round it all on there. I'll show you a few votes

[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:32.300]
Nothing personal Hank love you lose some weight will you please lose an ounce

[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:37.420]
And it's that was so depressing that he said to me. He said I just gave up, you know

[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:42.720]
You can't you can never give up. I don't think he really meant that you're just frustrated or and I relate to it man

[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:43.380]
Do I relate?

[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:49.300]
I had enough food for six people in Montreal man. Oh man great and they give it these big giant portions

[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:50.540]
It's the last thing I need

[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:52.880]
gigantic portions

[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:59.440]
But like you got to have something to do right? I guess you can't even sit in people watching the ball. I mean

[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:07.080]
Anyway, I guess I better vote for somebody under to get the poll started and then I can go back to the important Michael Jackson expose any inquirer

[01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:13.020]
I urge you enthusiastically to throw away the hell in the sun sentinel and just get the national inquirer every week

[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:16.480]
Plus you get your horoscope

[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:20.120]
Let's see we already got some votes on here. Look at that

[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:26.060]
Can you believe that I believe it for these two votes? Who would you like to see retire already retire?

[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:28.860]
Moe Howard David at nine very king eight

[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:34.900]
Bob Barker five the Humphors got four already told you here in Lewis two John Madden two regis filled in two

[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:37.920]
I'm in last place with only one come on time to retire

[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:40.260]
Anyway getting back to the story

[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:46.140]
The shaken mom decided it was time to leave. This is after the wine drinking was discovered

[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:47.940]
try the wine

[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:50.260]
She said I never drink

[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:54.240]
Eddie please come help me Eddie

[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.820]
That would have been a good 30 minute movie, you know

[01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:01.480]
Great movie go see it Edward

[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:06.480]
As the most beautiful man in the world what did people magazine called him the most

[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:12.060]
Sexiest hot sexiest man in rural Johnny Depp see they're always see they always have to do it like

[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:16.640]
Too late if they would have said that ten or twenty years ago. I said yeah, you know

[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:21.340]
But they always picked something like Paul Newman when he turned 85 or something. Oh the sexiest man in the world

[01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:22.080]
I kind of silly

[01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:27.340]
The shaken mom decided it was time to leave but the source claims Michael made some comments that the frightened woman

[01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:29.120]
Interpreted his meaning he would not let them go

[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:35.400]
She stayed put for hours convinced he was being held captive. She felt a little like Patrick McGuin on a bad day

[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:42.300]
She managed to slip out during the night and she called the house and told Jackson that she was going to call the police if he didn't let her children leave

[01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:45.580]
You can't keep us prisoner. She yelled Jackson let them all go

[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:48.960]
Soon as she said she's going to call a police let him all go

[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:53.940]
There as the relationship with the family deteriorated the glove one took off the gloves

[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:58.500]
They made preparations to defend himself. He contacted Scott Peterson's lawyer Mark Garagos

[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:04.260]
During a session with his therapist this past June the boy began talking about Jackson's alleged behavior

[01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:09.660]
And the therapist informed the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department which began investigating sources be saying

[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:15.720]
The psychologist was alarmed and when the mother was informed she was in shock shattered

[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:22.420]
She asked the boy over and over again if it was true remember a K in the godfather is it true Michael is it true?

[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:28.220]
The insider says the boy insisted it was true was a shocking realization

[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:36.880]
The police probe culminated with 60 officers raiding Neverland on November 18 and Jackson being escorted to jail in handcuffs November the 20th

[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:41.620]
Before being released on three million dollars bail he vehemently denied the molestation allegations

[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:44.480]
But the singer still has to face the music

[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.080]
Officials are convinced they're released two more victims and they're hoping they come forward reveal the source close to the investigation

[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:57.860]
Another inside sources police are also curious to learn if Jackson who has a history of prescription drug abuse used knockout drops on the

[01:44:57.860 --> 01:44:59.080]
Legend victim. Did you know that?

[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:03.720]
He had years of prescription drug abuse problem right no you do now

[01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:10.100]
As part of their raid they were looking for medications

[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:14.340]
They had questioned the mother and the boy before before hand extensively about

[01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:17.220]
Drugs that Jackson may have used under sun. They also spoke

[01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:23.040]
Confidentially with other parents of kids who were at Neverland around the same time as the boy said the inside source in June 99

[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:30.520]
The inquire revealed that Jackson had been abusing prescription painkillers even receiving some doses from an intravenous drip

[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.960]
Never have an intravenous drip no

[01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:39.940]
Jackson alleged fascination with Polaroid pictures that children came to light ten years ago

[01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:43.360]
In a lawsuit filed against him by several of his bodyguards

[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:48.940]
There was alleged in court papers that Jackson instructed one guard to destroy a Polaroid picture of a naked young boy

[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:55.120]
And an statement made by his former personal mage he said she'd seen Polaroid photos of a young boy by his bed

[01:45:56.500 --> 01:46:02.700]
The recent raid on Michael's ranch concentrated on photographic evidence and medications. They never land employed pulled in inquire

[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:08.260]
During the search they cleaned out a medicine cabinet all of his prescriptions were gone

[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:11.100]
They took home videos that were in his master bedroom

[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:12.100]
They also took cameras

[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:16.680]
But the source disclosed that police may not have gained access to a secret room above Michael's bedroom

[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:22.880]
It's accessed through a passageway. There's a couch TV and beanbag chairs in that room. It appears the police missed it

[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:23.800]
Beanbag chairs

[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:25.720]
Yeah, throw it back

[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:28.560]
Nothing if you're gonna molest somebody that'll at least be comfortable

[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:33.400]
We're sports radio 516

[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:34.800]
UAM

[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:39.060]
Leave me on my child

[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:46.120]
My lawyer says it's worth white love

[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:47.320]
For some

[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:56.280]
Those I've been looking around when excuse to explain my words

[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:02.040]
You can recognize me

[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:10.160]
My doctors have reached out my ethnicity

[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:14.720]
And I keep children around

[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:19.520]
And they sleep inside my bed

[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:28.700]
People say that I am gay

[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:34.660]
That is why I'm marrying me some Marie

[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:39.760]
Is great to play to compensate

[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.880]
With this song

[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:47.440]
That's really bad

[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:54.880]
Play it on my child

[01:47:55.540 --> 01:48:04.980]
And all of those toys that I never had

[01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:08.600]
The only choice no one's mind

[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:16.940]
With my drum and abuse in the dark

[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:22.600]
Before you judge me

[01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:25.780]
And call me free

[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:29.980]
Let me wine and hold

[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:32.820]
And say

[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:44.600]
I believe it on my child

[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:47.540]
Oh, we're fine

[01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:49.920]
For 18 at 560 WMT

[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:53.780]
Take a look at who's tied with the mommies do we might actually have a battle on our hands today

[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:54.980]
You see that? All right, I do

[01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:57.320]
What the hell was that?

[01:48:58.100 --> 01:48:58.500]
Sweeper

[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:00.820]
Yeah, it was a bissle

[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:02.580]
A bissle early if you ask me

[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:08.920]
Anyway 71 votes under 74 votes and Larry King and the mommies sure are like in a deadlock

[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:12.080]
There no stows Larry just pulled away and I'm glad because I voted for him

[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:17.320]
You did yes, see I don't think they want the moment to retire yet because then it takes away a lot of good material

[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:20.100]
Okay, it's a fact from Chris now this proves the point

[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:25.100]
It says I missed it Joe show this morning. Could you please replay the Joe ripping them oh no?

[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:29.900]

[01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:32.940]
Don't you wish you all ask Robert to get it for us

[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:43.240]
Chris goes on to say I mean what am I gonna say to that you're gonna ask Robert well

[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:45.600]
He's he's a backstabbing we still he'll supply it

[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:50.420]
Chris as I hate mow and hearing somebody ripping into his ass gives me a woody thanks advance

[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:54.000]
Okay, well work on it for a Chris. We work on that. We'll work on this

[01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:58.620]
This fact you sent me from Jim who's a regular facts, but unfortunately it just says

[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:03.560]
George W. Bush right. I think that's a poll suggestion of an addition

[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:08.700]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:16.060]
He doesn't get it. See that's a hold. We're not asking and see they don't understand the nuances of these polls

[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:22.500]
I mean we are sick and tired of him most of us, but the fact of the matter is uh, that's that's not in the same category

[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:27.880]
Don't you understand you understand I do we're talking about old parts who've been around too long and staff for them to retire

[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:33.380]
78 votes. Mohar david is a 23 who would you most like to see retire already?

[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:36.320]
Most got 23 lyric king 22. I thought you said they were moved ahead

[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:41.760]
It is briefly. Oh briefly. Oh barber 11 the humbers got nine

[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:42.540]
Hey stupid

[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:47.300]
John madden five jury Lewis four the O'Rodges two read this film in two

[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:52.200]
Anyway, oh wait wait till I get to the good stuff here. Okay. Okay

[01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:57.700]
Jack goes Las Vegas boys only blow out when it doubt blow it out, but anyway before we do that

[01:50:58.820 --> 01:50:59.260]
Uh

[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.220]
This we just wear the beanbag chairpoint. Okay, that's right

[01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:10.760]
For the most part the police were thorough added the source. They even turned over a vase or is that vase in the entry hall where Michael used to hide candy

[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:13.400]
Those SNM. I mean Eminemus

[01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:18.560]
The source told the inquire a great find for the investigators would have been a logbook kept by security at the main gate

[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:21.560]
All the kids that passed through are entered into this logbook

[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:27.180]
A decade ago Jackson escape prosecution and similar charges involving a 13 year old boy by reaching a

[01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:34.700]
15.3 million dollar settlement with the youngsters family this time around the same Santa Barbara district attorney Thomas Snedden said the victim of the alleged

[01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:39.980]
Acts who turns 14 this month was cooperating in that he would testify against Jackson

[01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:45.600]
However due to his health problems that remains a question if down the road the uncancer patient will be well enough to testify in court

[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:50.540]
The child's family is not seeking monetary damages said Snedden

[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:56.280]
Should I read that paragraph again because Mark Erragost is running around all all they want is money. They're a bunch of great robbers

[01:51:57.240 --> 01:52:02.620]
The child's family is not seeking monetary damages said Snedden never less than insider

[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:07.880]
Defenders are preparing to show the youngsters mother as the woman who's ultimately out to bleed Michael for money

[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:15.780]
Right a major part of their defense will be that the woman in her son sought revenge on Michael their benefactor when he long no longer wanted to support them in luxury

[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:22.360]
They'll show how Michael's help and kindness enable the boy to get his cancer in a remission the singer will be arranged January the 9th

[01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.020]
So I thought was December 15

[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:31.200]
Nicky pushing it back pushing it back the singer will be arranged anywhere the nine predicts he'll be exonerated

[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:38.360]
Lies runs sprints but the truth runs marathons Jackson said the truth will witness marathon in court Michael said

[01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:40.260]
now

[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:47.620]
now alcohol cigarettes and two weeks of partying at jackos Las Vegas boys only blow out

[01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:47.920]
Oh

[01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:51.780]
And it wasn't just a morat there

[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:58.300]
There is a picture of him with a SARS mask that's the only thing I can imagine that this is it's

[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:04.520]
I just I'm looking at this thing. I mean he is so far beyond bizarre, you know yeah

[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:09.820]
45 years old. I mean at what point do we stop being bizarre? Oh

[01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:15.840]
He's just getting started mast Michael and a young companion in white cap check into the hotel. Here's the picture

[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:19.580]
It's on page 19 you're gonna go out and get the inquirer. I'm sure of it. Yes

[01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:25.160]
Or somebody will bring you one unaware that cops were closing into arrest him on molestation charges

[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:31.520]
Michael Jackson party nonstop in Las Vegas with a slew of underage boys the inquirer has learned exclusively

[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:38.460]
And sconst in a lavish private villa at the maratio hotel in casino from November the turt to the 19th

[01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:40.860]
Jackson surrounded himself with a pack of young boys

[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:46.920]
And allowed no adults to enter the premises as booze and cigarettes were delivered to their rooms at all hours

[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:51.360]
Doesn't that sound like the kind of guy that's interested in taking good carry young kids? Sure

[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:56.320]
He wants to take a ride. He was always we're always hearing about oh he loves the children and uh, you know

[01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:00.400]
Hmm booze and cigarettes and something about packing

[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:06.160]
So many youngsters came and went at the villa that some of them evidently had to sleep in the bath tubs

[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:11.720]
And by the time the 45-year-old star left the villa to answer molestation charges in california

[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:13.720]
Jackson his young party mates had racked up

[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:16.740]
$25,000 in property damages to boot a

[01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:20.500]
Ain't none. It was a 24-hour boy party a hotel

[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:25.600]
A 24-hour boy party a hotel inside it declared

[01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:31.700]
During a rare foray from the villa Jackson turned up at the art divin yet's art gallery with four youngsters

[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:36.720]
He had one girl and three boys in the 12 to 13-year-old range with him when he arrived at my store

[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:38.840]
Said gallery owner Barberley Wullen

[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:41.900]
The kids were following him pointing at things him giggling

[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:47.920]
Michael wanted a $6,000 bronze statue of a bare-chested boy looking at the sky with birds on his arm

[01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:50.860]
Which is pictured right here by the way

[01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:56.600]
The insider disclosed Michael's Vegas trip was a continuous blowout for himself and his underage male guests

[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:00.360]
I know he's being investigated for child molestation charges in Santa Barbara

[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:04.440]
But his recent behavior with minors in Las Vegas should be looked into as well. It says

[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:08.920]
There was no apparent at also provision for any of the kids who came and went

[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:12.180]
They came and went

[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:18.320]
Michael made it clear to the hotel staff that he was the only person outside the boys allowed to enter his villa

[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:22.780]
The kids even ordered booze and cigarettes off the hotel rooms service menu

[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:28.040]
The hotel's room service menu get that I got among the atoms. I start to love her to the villa

[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:30.100]
Kakronro whiskey

[01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:33.060]
Bailey's liqueur and marble and marble or light cigarettes

[01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:35.300]
In other words

[01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:39.080]
They were puppet on faggots in there. Well, maybe those were all for Michael

[01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:41.840]
How many faggots do you think we're in there?

[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:44.900]
Michael was decked out in full makeup

[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:47.720]
It wasn't just a little bit of foundation, but heavy showgirl makeup

[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:53.120]
He was wearing very thick pancake on his face along with black eyeliner. Are you show girl

[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:58.940]
Whenever I saw him he was wearing the same purple gray and black silk pajamas with two sets of buttons at the top

[01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:00.380]
He looked like a geisha girl

[01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:06.200]
And Michael seemed to exist in his own space-doubt world

[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:11.300]
I felt like Michael was completely out of touch with the day-to-day reality the gay to day to day day

[01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:17.040]
How did I mention speaking of that norm cannon as a soldist newspaper they expressed? We'll get to it maybe

[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:21.520]
Or maybe we can tease it for tomorrow because I know everybody's hanging on the edge of their seat

[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:27.020]
Hey, by the way norm low me 50 million dollars. Okay. Don't you think he owes me like a fortune now?

[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:27.680]

[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:39.080]
Yes, remind you pop them with his but those bubble head dolls

This is the boring looks better than a live radio show every morning on TV well just about anything

[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:28.380]
But that hasn't stopped msnbc from teeming up with radio's original bad boy who now looks like a nasty old lady

[01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:54.440]
Jerry Lewis 15 Bob Barker 14 Hank Goldberg 12 John Madden 6

[01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:57.240]

Did somebody bring in a check for the 95 bucks to get us to 43 grand yet?

[02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:09.060]
Come on

[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:10.400]
Yeah, oh, there's norm

[02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:15.640]
Yeah, right and Norma should bring us in like 95 grand easy for a band and pay rescue

[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:22.120]
I'm sure we have his own part. I'm just for us. No, it's seriously at all in all fairness. He's got like a hundred dogs

[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:30.680]
Some of their actually canines. No, he's a he's a dog person. He's had a lot of dogs. That's what you told me

[02:00:32.100 --> 02:00:35.380]
See you just keep stretching it the stretch in it yeah

[02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:37.000]
Like snap

[02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:40.540]
Anyway, getting back to this Vegas business at the Mirage

[02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:44.540]
There's just not there's not a whole lot more of this because then we got a lot of important calls to get in plus

[02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:46.020]
We got that story about the bullsemen

[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:47.400]
Huh?

[02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:48.880]
We'll get to it

[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:55.480]
Three boys who appeared to be between the ages of 12 and 14 checked in with Michael instead with him throughout his 16 day visit

[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:56.440]
The two bedroom villa

[02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:03.880]
Michael footed the bill for the villa villa one which was $4,000 a night while his staff occupied another three bedroom villa at five grand

[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:08.920]
A night a lany room at 1500 a night and a hotel room at just a mere 500 bucks a night

[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:14.500]
Chum change Michael at his entire entourage went by the last name of Parker

[02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:21.600]
His personal chef was Mrs. Parker his driver was mr. Parker and the three kids plus all the other kids who came and went

[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:22.920]
I'll see you the name Parker

[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:24.240]
Mm-hmm

[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:26.900]
What are we gonna do with the broad Parker outside

[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:33.680]
Two of Michael's three kids were African-Americans and more was Caucasian one of the African-American boys seem to be drunk much of the time

[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:34.600]
He slurred his words

[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:39.120]
The white kids stood out because his mannerisms were extremely feminine

[02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:40.300]
Oh

[02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:46.960]
The three core boys were a little more polished than the other young boys who would show up randomly the visiting kids seem more like

[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:48.120]
Street kids are runaways

[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:53.280]
When the street kids showed up at the marrige they would remain behind closed doors in michael's room for a few hours

[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:56.400]
Then leave it was strange because you never see these kids twice

[02:01:56.860 --> 02:01:58.460]
use them and lose them

[02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:06.520]
Or is it co use them abuse them and lose them and whatever the new kids showed up additional room service orders for food alcohol and cigarettes would be called in

[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:10.000]
Michael was the only adult allowed in or out of villa one

[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.360]
He must have been drinking a lot of booze and spoken a lot of faggots, you know what that's right handfuls of her wow

[02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:20.560]
Michael was the only adult allowed in or out of villa one the housekeepers at the marrige complain that even the maids were not allowed to enter

[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:22.880]
The entire time michael was there

[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:26.560]
There was no one allowed in to clean up and became a mess

[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:32.900]
The kids shoved trays with dirty dishes booze bottles cigarette packs and pop cans outside the door and left them to be picked up

[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:38.000]
When michael and his party check how now let me ask you this before I finish these the last part of this

[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.780]
How come we have to read the inquiry to find this out?

[02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:48.020]
Why is the mainstream media which all of a sudden has gone from that initial feeding frenzy to that oh je like a bronco thing on a highway

[02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:51.960]
How come they've gone from that to virtual silence now because the

[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:58.740]
President you think because mark garrigo said we're gonna come down on anybody like a elephant on an ant if you know

[02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:00.920]
You think no

[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:06.240]
Then why aren't they telling us all of these things? I think because the president's trip to england is over

[02:03:06.780 --> 02:03:07.020]
Oh

[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:10.100]
And his surprise trip to iraq with his turkey

[02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:17.620]
When michael and his party checked out of marrige villa one looked like a bomb had hit it

[02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:23.280]
The carpets and a poultry on the chairs and couches and the bed spreads were all ruined with stains and had to be replaced

[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:28.240]
And a number of prescription pill bottles some unopened were left behind in the trash heap

[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:34.660]
The destruction in villa one was so bad that the hotel actually videotape the room as michael and his guests have left it

[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:39.840]
The hotel made arrangements to send a bill for $25,000 in damages to michael's manager

[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:46.820]
Because there's only one queen-sized bed per room where everyone slept during michael's stay was a mystery until he checked out

[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:52.960]
At that point hotel staff discovered blankets and pillows stuffed in the villa's bathtubs

[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:56.340]
Which had obviously been used as makeshift beds by some of the boys

[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:03.760]
michael's young guests also had access to the hotel's expensive shops and boutique shops in seasors palace and treasure islanding inside a reveal

[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:08.160]
The kids were allowed to purchase souvenirs clothing toys games and whatever the hearts desired

[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:14.160]
Among the items delivered to his villa were two stuffed white tigers from the marrige. I wonder if one of them belonged to

[02:04:15.140 --> 02:04:18.080]
We got a story on him by the way. He's doing a little bit better. He went

[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:20.760]
Hey, he went the other day

[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:27.640]
Two white stuffed tigers in the rise life-size statues of Humphrey Bullgart and a buckingham palace guard and a slew of video games

[02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:32.020]
The villa was turned into a combination arcade toy store and kitty cocktail lounge

[02:04:32.020 --> 02:04:38.560]
Where were the parents of these young men who ran to mystery jaxon and come to Vegas to shoot a music video for his latest single one more chance

[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:42.660]
How appropriate he'd hired 500 extras to work on the video

[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:46.800]
Which is being shot at the cmx sports and entertainment complex near the palms resort

[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:52.920]
There were lots of kids hanging around michael throughout the shoot half a dozen underage boys were always hovering near him

[02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:55.000]
I remember objections otterrages disclosed

[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:58.520]
michael seemed very upbeat there were no indications he knew when arrest was coming

[02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.940]
No tell inside or at it

[02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:05.360]
I found it very disturbing to observe michael's boy bandor it is mirage villa the fact that these boys were there

[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:08.760]
seemingly without parents of any adults in provision was wrong at one point

[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:14.620]
I was tempted to call the cops because the whole situation seemed weird and inappropriate to me. So he said

[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:15.640]
Okay

[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:19.940]
Okay, there's a couple of other things in here. There's a thing about his uh

[02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:23.360]
The kids father the accused the kids father very strange

[02:05:23.980 --> 02:05:30.520]
But anyway, it goes on and on and get this weeks inquire okay the December 9th issue jaxon victim's story is on a cover

[02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:34.300]
Tax band who auction off bullsemen seized in florida

Well, what else are you going to do with it?

[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:48.420]

[02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:19.540]
November 11th at Ernest Goulae elementary school when a classmate asked him about his mother and father

[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:23.500]
McClurene responded that he had two mothers because his mother is gay

[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:30.240]
When the other child asked for explanation McClurene told him gay is when a girl likes another girl according to the complaint

[02:12:30.780 --> 02:12:36.680]
A teacher overhearing her mark scolded McClurene telling him gay is a bad word and sending him to the principal's office

[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:42.940]
The following week the school required the boy to attend a behavioral clinic at 6.45 in the morning where he was forced to

[02:12:42.940 --> 02:12:49.140]
repeatedly write I will never use the word gay in school again. These civil liberties groups said a

[02:12:49.140 --> 02:12:53.640]
phone message for James Easton Superintendent Lafayette Paris schools was not returned Monday

[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:58.700]
The ACLU claims that McClurene's constitutional rights are violated by the school district at the ACLU

[02:12:58.700 --> 02:13:01.800]
We often deal with schools at mistreat gait children and children have gay parents

[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:07.400]
But this is beyond the pale so Ken Cho an attorney for ACLU lesbian and gay rights project

[02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:15.940]
Joe Cook executive director of the ACLU in Louisiana said the children in gaitland lesbian parents have the same rights as any other children to talk about their families

[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:23.800]
Although no suit has been filed the ACLU demanded that the school remove all mentioned the case from McClurene's disciplinary record and apologize to the boy and his mother

[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:29.160]
We buy the guy's I was concerned when the assistant principal called me and told me my son had said a word

[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:32.040]
So bad he didn't want to repeat it over the phone said the boy's mother sheeran huff

[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:37.200]
But that was nothing compared to the shock I felt when my little boy came home and told me that his teacher had told him

[02:13:37.940 --> 02:13:40.200]
His family is a dirty word

[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:42.480]
How do you like that

[02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:47.540]

[02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:07.320]
No, that really but first we got to take some of these calls though qa m. Hello

[02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:07.680]
ah

[02:20:09.140 --> 02:20:13.440]

Oh Dave Van Horn. I like Dave Van Horn is excellent

[02:20:21.220 --> 02:20:26.920]
You know the fact that and I realized that if the marlins are spending money, yeah, does that say what does it say on a log?

[02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:32.020]
Because my doesn't say does it say C.A. Josh works as Florida marlins who run all the spots today

[02:20:32.740 --> 02:20:35.560]
It was written in it just as FL marlins

[02:20:36.820 --> 02:20:40.620]
It doesn't say trade or C.A. next to it. No, it was written in

[02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:42.440]
I'll be damned

[02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:48.400]
No, I know mine is written in two, but I thought maybe on your log it said what of course I should know better because this is just a copy here

[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:53.700]
Log anyway am I stupid yes, I am, but I mean I'm just wondering if they're actually paying for that or if it's like a trade deal

[02:20:54.340 --> 02:20:58.220]
But even regardless my suggestion to the Marlin organization is if you're gonna promote

[02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:04.380]
Enthusiasm and excitement for next season with the marlins don't use the worth and I was at a real clip from the end of the world

[02:21:04.380 --> 02:21:07.260]
Seriously, that can't be that's got to be one of those you know where they just kind of make it up

That is the most embarrassing call in the history of broadcast

[02:21:24.780 --> 02:21:25.140]

[02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:40.400]

Our midday guy had a lot of laughs with it

[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:12.560]
The laughter ends at some point my man

[02:22:14.020 --> 02:22:19.560]
And this dopiness perceive the stick is aesonine

[02:22:20.940 --> 02:22:23.020]

It's coming squirt squirt buckle you seatbelts because when I drop it

[02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:44.160]
What happened in Hiroshima in 45 is nothing

Because when I drop the bomb

[02:22:48.340 --> 02:22:53.680]
On certain folks here and certain folks elsewhere it's going to be painful baby

[02:22:56.160 --> 02:23:00.780]
We don't want to get into personalities. Oh god forbid we sure don't want to do that. No no no

Yeah, can you see Mo versus for all in the morning? They're good friends

[02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:17.420]
They're good close personal friends, so obviously they wouldn't let me take no chance of each other, but of course that

[02:23:17.940 --> 02:23:19.120]
Can you just do that

[02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:28.120]

[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:20.040]
That's got to be one of those things where they just you know, they put it together because they didn't have the real clipper and the real from the real game

[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:25.860]
That is the real clip from them Florida marlin's winning the world series

[02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:31.200]
And it is so uninspired so boring so staccato so

[02:24:32.500 --> 02:24:32.900]
unacceptable

[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:37.840]
And a marlin's wonder why during the regular season there's a little bit more excitement

[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:38.740]
I got news for a man

[02:24:38.740 --> 02:24:42.020]
one of the things that makes people fans of any sport are citing broadcasters

[02:24:42.020 --> 02:24:44.420]

W-Q-A-M

[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:11.400]

[02:25:21.940 --> 02:25:26.940]
Not third man. Yeah, we're getting sick of tearing to that bitch. A lot of similarity between her and Larry as in the way they talk

[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:27.920]
Yeah

[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:30.200]

[02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:37.100]
Unite media one of the nation's largest gay-oriented media companies is buying stock photos express gay news

[02:25:37.100 --> 02:25:42.880]
Right express publisher Norma Kent wouldn't have all the terms of the ill which is scheduled to close today

[02:25:43.700 --> 02:25:51.560]

[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:58.600]
I'm gonna be very well off for a very long time said Kent 54 lawyer and radio tacos to launch the expression

January 2000 as he recuperated from cancer. I went from the hospital to millionaire in four years

[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:09.700]
Aren't you just a guest at those comments? I'm a gagging

[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:15.720]
Cancer's express gay news has a weekly circulation of 20,000 from South Beach to Palm Beach

400,000 meters according to window media website. They can take the express to where I can't can't say

[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:36.180]
Many local bars restaurants and guest houses are hesitant to advertise in single local newspapers

[02:26:36.180 --> 02:26:39.360]
Soon they'll be able to buy ad packages and all the window media publications

[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:42.740]
They can be in every paper from New York to South Florida Kent said

[02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:47.200]
Kent's name or may not on the express mast, but he won't have an active role in the paper

[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:50.840]
He'll be too busy trying to get the near Roger show syndicated uh worldwide

[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:53.880]

[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:54.520]

What the eighth Monday the eighth was that is something like that

[02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:08.200]
Yeah, I would ease that a new show of me promoting that for them heavily

[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:11.200]
Another right winger just what they need was one more right wing

[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:16.340]
Just make it perfect just to make sure that the government looks favorably on all the cheap channel

[02:28:16.340 --> 02:28:20.800]
Radio station applications for renewal and spite of all their fixed contest and rig stuff

[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:27.480]
And I sure hope for his sake and for the broadcast industry sake that if for well read it is there at 940

[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:31.960]
He takes a little bit of my advice which he wouldn't take when he was on this station, but he won't he won't

[02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:39.840]

But it kills a good hour. That's what Hank said kill some good time and Clarence said that hour gets a good number

[02:31:44.940 --> 02:31:45.740]
You ready for that?

Okay, so it goes to show you if the sport holes are desperate enough to listen when bino cookies on a really must be

Like that because bino cook is this boring as dog poop man. He is just terminal and has absolutely nothing to say

[02:32:00.280 --> 02:32:04.060]
But you know why the Humber put some on a kills an hour and he says bino knows his real good

[02:36:55.900 --> 02:37:02.080]
Yeah I wanted to just say I'm telling Neil to add Diane Rees that lady that's on it that 100 year old lady that's on the radio

[02:37:03.260 --> 02:37:04.140]
Diana Rees

[02:37:04.140 --> 02:37:06.660]
No Diane Rees she's on Diane Rees

[02:37:06.660 --> 02:37:08.380]
You know it's a big show he's making fun of her

[02:37:08.900 --> 02:37:09.640]
Diane Rees?

[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:11.560]
Yeah is this Neil?

[02:37:12.140 --> 02:37:13.560]
I have no idea who that is

[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:18.300]
You know that lady that's on the regular radio she could actually can hardly talk a long good morning

[02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:24.480]
You have any idea who he's talking about?

[02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:24.820]
Nope

[02:37:25.260 --> 02:37:29.060]
That sounded a little bit to me like Reverend Jones without the affectation didn't it?

[02:37:29.220 --> 02:37:30.820]
A little bit but I don't think yeah that was that was him

[02:37:30.820 --> 02:37:31.820]
That was Reverend Jones

[02:37:31.820 --> 02:37:35.240]
See anybody that we don't know what they're talking about or who it is it's Reverend Jones

[02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:37.260]
Just to cover our ass

[02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:40.500]
5670560 mobile

[02:37:41.100 --> 02:37:43.080]
Mobile fertile for a section gambling

[02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:47.980]
Using your cell phone to play the lottery and browse pornography could be a market worth

[02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:50.800]
Billions of dollars in two years according to Juniper research

[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:54.480]
So what you and Duff we're talking about this morning after I hang up my microphone

[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:57.160]
Here is so you get on the ground floor right now

[02:37:58.300 --> 02:37:58.740]
I

[02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:04.640]
Says the business will develop only if regulators and mobile communications companies do the right things the European provider of business intelligence

[02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:09.520]
Cautions safety security and child protection must be the number one priority said Paul Skeleton

[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:11.960]
Senior analyst the mobile entertainment specialist

[02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:18.200]
Blocking span is also critical as these the development of trustworthy and reliable payment systems he said

[02:38:19.100 --> 02:38:21.140]
He estimated mobile

[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:24.080]
Mobile adult content sales could total

[02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:28.340]
791 million dollars in 2006 with more than half coming from video

[02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:30.860]
But the big payoff will be in gambling services

[02:38:30.860 --> 02:38:37.660]
That's almost six billion dollar market with lot of recent competitions worth 2.8 billion and wagering another 2 billion dollars

[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:43.720]
So in other words the Humphorant to have it to call his bookie or interrupt the show for calls from the book in the middle of the show

[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:48.780]
He can just punch in the numbers right there on his cell phone. Oh, you can do that right now. I could do it right now with myself

[02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:50.700]
Can you can you play the lottery on a cell phone now?

[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:56.200]
I'm not sure about the lottery but but you can certainly gamble I can access my very credit this you will be able to yeah

[02:38:57.620 --> 02:39:03.300]
The 50,000 people living in Cerritos, California are expected to have citywide wireless internet access available next month

[02:39:03.300 --> 02:39:08.540]
Air net wireless is agreed to play shoebox size radio transmitters throughout the town in the LA area

[02:39:08.540 --> 02:39:10.660]
What's believed to be the nation's first such installation?

[02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:11.380]
All right

[02:39:11.380 --> 02:39:15.440]
Air net believes there are other dozen California cities where it could do the same thing according to the LA times

[02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:22.440]
The city will pay for only about 60 60 access accounts that will be used by building inspectors enforcement officers and others who work in the field

[02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:28.220]
We've been getting complaints almost every week from people about high-speed service and can't get it said city manager Arthur Galucci

[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:36.260]
The local phone company Verizon communications is unable to provide the SL service to the to the southern third of the city and the local cable company hasn't upgraded

[02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:41.700]
The system handle high-speed service. How do you like that? So they're gonna put a little box. I like it the whole city will be a hot box

[02:39:41.700 --> 02:39:46.220]
And the whole city will be one big hot box and there's nothing like a hot box

[02:39:46.220 --> 02:39:50.780]
That I always said I can't believe that Dave and boring doesn't have any votes yet on this thing. He better get some

[02:39:50.780 --> 02:39:53.200]
He don't have one yet. How is that possible?

[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:57.720]
How is it possible that none of the people that we added on have got any votes?

[02:39:58.420 --> 02:40:09.160]
Barbara Walters don't have any Dave and Horne Paul Harvey and Dan Marino don't have any I mean the vote totals are increasing but how come they have none the big oh?

[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:13.400]
I don't know this multi-taters. Can you explain that to me? I cannot

[02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:18.300]
Maybe they're on my thing here. Let's go to the regular homepage, okay?

[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:24.080]
And make sure that those are showing up on here because I'm sure that Eric wouldn't be a dick and around with us. What do you? Of course not

[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:30.540]
Because it is a labor of love. I just want to check underneath scurran and look who's on her looking a lot better

[02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:40.680]
No 284 is the vote total and those four people are gotten none. Dave and Horne. What I just reloaded it 287 Dave and Van Horne just got one well

[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:42.420]
It's about time probably his wife

[02:40:43.620 --> 02:40:45.300]
Now here's the question of the day

[02:40:47.140 --> 02:40:49.960]
Ohio panel starts probing the fatal beating now

[02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:55.420]
Can't believe that one guy we had called earlier hadn't seen it on he must watch the comedy channel all day

[02:40:55.420 --> 02:40:59.440]
I think they were showing it on there too. He must live at a cave. I just don't get it

[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:03.340]
How anybody could not have seen the 600 pound I mean the 350 pound guy

[02:41:03.340 --> 02:41:08.760]
It's 650 who was really being no cook after dipped in chocolate and now he's dipped in

[02:41:09.260 --> 02:41:09.660]
Schmidt

[02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:12.620]
Once he hit no mo a

[02:41:12.620 --> 02:41:18.840]
Subitone watchdog panel born from riots that followed the shooting of an unarmed black man in 2001 is looking to another death this time

[02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:26.460]
A black man died after wrestling with six officers Francis of doom and like I said everybody who's out of the cave has seen that video over and over and over and over

[02:41:26.460 --> 02:41:28.740]
In fact speaking of the cable of a show of summer scene. That's right

[02:41:30.860 --> 02:41:38.280]
Nathaniel Jones 41 died at a hospital shortly after being taken because of the Sunday the 350 pound man was struck repeatedly with night sticks in a

[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:41.160]
Confrontation captured by a police cruiser video camera

[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:46.060]
The cause of the thingal Jones death was under investigation preliminary autopsy

[02:41:46.060 --> 02:41:53.940]
See and I wonder remember all the riots of course in California for Rodney King incident and I'm certainly not depending the cops would beat the crap out of Rodney King

[02:41:53.940 --> 02:41:56.980]
But number one he survived and number two

[02:41:56.980 --> 02:41:59.500]
He turned out to be a bigger scumbag than they thought he was right

[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:03.820]
He sued he got all that money and he still turned out to be a scumbag

[02:42:04.860 --> 02:42:08.140]
I got arrested over it over and over again

[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:12.220]
Am I right? That's right. I am absolutely

[02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:19.330]
Absolutely correct sir the cause of Nathaniel Jones death death is still in the investigation preliminary autopsy results

[02:42:19.330 --> 02:42:25.970]
So he had in large chart his blood contained cocaine and PCP or angel dust both of which can cause erratic behavior

[02:42:25.970 --> 02:42:27.230]
You can still radical behavior

[02:42:28.390 --> 02:42:33.930]
The citizen complaint authority created after the 2000 arrests already was looking to the death with investigators

[02:42:33.930 --> 02:42:39.450]
Going to the parking lot of a fast food restaurant where the beating took place hours later panel chairwoman Nancy Minson said

[02:42:39.450 --> 02:42:44.670]
She said the complaint for began its investigation on its own which you can do in a death involves police or when shots are fired

[02:42:44.670 --> 02:42:50.490]
We turned to you for a full and fair and thorough investigation mere Charlie Luke and told members last night

[02:42:51.650 --> 02:42:55.650]
Monday nights regular meeting of the panel was disrupted by four activists who demanded quick action

[02:42:56.250 --> 02:43:00.090]
It's apparent that you don't know what you're supposed to be doing and what your authority is saying it late

[02:43:00.090 --> 02:43:04.770]
Livington, Jr a member of the coalition for a Justinson and Eusha. What's a boycott of the city?

[02:43:05.250 --> 02:43:08.930]
When they start fighting us in the streets you'll say why didn't you do it the right way?

[02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:12.310]
Why don't you come to city hall? Why didn't you trust us? Why didn't you talk to us?

[02:43:13.890 --> 02:43:18.630]
Minson called police to escort Livingston and three others from the room when they continued to shout at the panel

[02:43:18.630 --> 02:43:23.550]
Jones death raised new allegations of police brutality just as the city was starting to recover from the effects of the April

[02:43:23.550 --> 02:43:26.770]
2000 and one of my eyes and a boycott that followed in this case the cops are right

[02:43:28.190 --> 02:43:30.050]
After reviewing the video tape and

[02:43:30.830 --> 02:43:37.130]
Seeing it from the very beginning where he was threatening the cops and he was totally off his off his nut just crazy

[02:43:37.130 --> 02:43:39.450]
I mean they did the right thing in

[02:43:40.650 --> 02:43:46.070]
In addition which we still don't know that he died from the beating because it said there's no evidence of any internal injuries from the beating right

[02:43:46.070 --> 02:43:49.470]
And I think we would all agree he had a coming

[02:43:50.570 --> 02:43:52.450]
Wouldn't we agree on that I agree and

[02:43:53.050 --> 02:43:55.930]
He disagreed. Let's see some hands. I don't see any hands up

[02:43:56.790 --> 02:44:03.250]
Everybody agrees now that pulsian and took I mean to probably some Ojohn provocateurs were probably try to start a big thing in Cincinnati

[02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:14.790]
This was a different thing this wasn't who was the guy from cheese how soon they forget 1980 here Liberty City over in Tampa the guy from the guy from there

[02:44:14.790 --> 02:44:15.790]
The right to the city

[02:44:16.970 --> 02:44:21.810]
Mcduffie that's right Arthur Mcduffie. He was an insurance sales guy. That's right did a wheelie

[02:44:23.010 --> 02:44:27.710]
They won't do it no more. No, they should him what for I mean that was a whole different story man

[02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:30.730]
Mm-hmm. He had an expired driver's license or something like that and

[02:44:31.850 --> 02:44:38.390]
Then Rodney King that's another story altogether. I mean that was a beating that just went on and on and on and on and on

[02:44:39.030 --> 02:44:41.350]
But this type of crap man. He was a bad news

[02:44:42.030 --> 02:44:43.790]
He was dangerous and now he's dead

[02:44:44.690 --> 02:44:50.650]

[02:47:33.930 --> 02:47:35.350]
Brought oh yes

[02:47:37.630 --> 02:47:38.510]
Illusion illusionist

[02:47:38.510 --> 02:47:40.390]
Brought port of sick-free to end

[02:47:40.390 --> 02:47:45.990]
Brought slowly recovering from that tiger attack that's kept him hospitalized. Hey no tober's partner said what that was not a tiger attack

[02:47:45.990 --> 02:47:47.250]
The tiger was rescuing him

[02:47:47.810 --> 02:47:49.910]
We'll get to that. Oh good just relax

[02:47:50.710 --> 02:47:56.090]
He's moving now little by little sick-free to fishbocker send it and if you want NBC's to be show he's speaking a few words

[02:47:56.090 --> 02:47:57.390]
But it develops also every day

[02:47:58.350 --> 02:48:00.350]
Saturday's it and the Sunday's it

[02:48:03.310 --> 02:48:08.230]
Roy has been off respirator for two weeks fishbocker said is recovered enough to spend Christmas in Vegas

[02:48:08.230 --> 02:48:10.610]
Where the door were performing at the time of the attack?

[02:48:10.830 --> 02:48:16.430]
He's currently a patient at UCLA Medical Center in LA. I think he's gonna recover everything fishbocker said I have no doubt

[02:48:18.730 --> 02:48:19.530]
Fishbocker downplayed

[02:48:19.530 --> 02:48:24.990]
Roy's injuries from the October 3rd attack describing the illusionist wound as a little punch hole on the left side of his neck

[02:48:25.930 --> 02:48:27.330]
Fishbocker said a stroke that

[02:48:28.150 --> 02:48:32.590]
Suffered after the incident resulted from blood pressure medication that sometimes made him feel faint

[02:48:33.190 --> 02:48:37.750]
Horn 59 was mauled by one of the white tigers featured in the duo show at the Marys Hotel Casino in Vegas

[02:48:38.310 --> 02:48:44.190]
Fishbocker has suggested the animal was trying to help horn but other animal experts disputed that and there was one

[02:48:44.190 --> 02:48:50.750]
Even asshole that we heard this morning on city pulse that said that he actually suffered a stroke on stage and the animal was

[02:48:50.750 --> 02:48:55.070]
Aware of the fact that he was in distress. I was trying to save him and the dragon off the stage

[02:48:57.070 --> 02:48:57.610]
Right

[02:48:58.350 --> 02:49:06.090]
Sure, I now I want to listen to this very carefully after we took that earlier poll about that courageous trip through Iraq by the El Presidente

[02:49:06.090 --> 02:49:08.250]
Yeah, one of the most

[02:49:08.250 --> 02:49:17.770]
Espacifal moments during President George W. Bush's secret flight to Baghdad according to the White House came on a British airways pilot spotted Air Force 1 soaring over the Atlantic

[02:49:18.790 --> 02:49:22.050]
The mid-air encounter now listen to this part very carefully

[02:49:23.210 --> 02:49:27.850]
The mid-air encounter which aids say nearly prompted the president to call off the trip

[02:49:29.770 --> 02:49:31.770]
became an instant news sensation

[02:49:32.310 --> 02:49:37.950]
Memoralized by tourist pins which went on sale of the store and Crawford within hours of Bush's return to West Texas ranch

[02:49:39.170 --> 02:49:43.330]
The mid-air encounter which aids say nearly prompted the president to call off the trip

[02:49:44.770 --> 02:49:50.570]
But days after the sudden the identity of the pilot remains a mystery even to British airways and airline spokeswoman said this weekend

[02:49:50.570 --> 02:49:54.030]
I know crew member had come forward to report the unusual encounter as a standard practice

[02:49:54.570 --> 02:50:03.930]
Bush aged recounted with excitement the moment during the flight to Baghdad when the British airways pilot thought he spotted the president's blue and white Boeing 747 from his cockpit

[02:50:04.590 --> 02:50:07.130]
Did I just see Air Force 1 the pilot radioed?

[02:50:07.410 --> 02:50:14.630]
There was a pause then came the response from Air Force 1 Gulf Stream 5 a much smaller aircraft as one of Bush's aids

[02:50:14.630 --> 02:50:18.590]
We counted the BA pilot seemed to sense that he was in on the secret and replied oh

[02:50:19.910 --> 02:50:21.070]
He's saying oh

[02:50:22.730 --> 02:50:25.350]
Yeah, not not nudge nudge

[02:50:26.310 --> 02:50:30.370]
Within with three hours to go Bush had the secret service check if his mission was still secret

[02:50:32.410 --> 02:50:39.390]
They assured me that there was still a tight hold on the information that conditions on the ground was positive as positive could be he said afterward

[02:50:41.330 --> 02:50:47.890]
Bush's Thanksgiving trip to Baghdad captivated people in Crawford and tourists who came to its tiny downtown to buy up momentos of the trip

[02:50:49.130 --> 02:50:51.750]
Momentos in fact, he's got a written on his wrist where the hell he was

[02:50:52.590 --> 02:50:58.690]
Large pins featuring the president's plan and the BA pilots words that I just see Air Force 1 were sold out by midday Saturday

[02:50:58.690 --> 02:50:59.850]
All right

[02:50:59.850 --> 02:51:01.150]
hook them horns

[02:51:02.250 --> 02:51:05.210]
In response to pressing queries British Airways check with its crews

[02:51:05.210 --> 02:51:09.350]
But so far like we told it before no one's come forward. They're all like oh no, we don't know nothing

[02:51:09.350 --> 02:51:15.010]
We didn't we didn't know no Godfather or Air Force 1. Oh look at that sewing in Rochester, New York

[02:51:17.030 --> 02:51:21.390]
Well, this has been quiet for what that was then all about what would they have out a thing from Rochester near now?

[02:51:21.430 --> 02:51:23.630]
They've kind of peaked my interest oh

[02:51:23.630 --> 02:51:25.390]
And look at who you have you seen this

[02:51:26.930 --> 02:51:32.210]
Are you on CNN I know what oh, it's too late. They just showed that clip again of Linda trip on with our good friend

[02:51:32.210 --> 02:51:33.750]

[02:51:41.270 --> 02:51:41.630]
Wow

[02:51:42.490 --> 02:51:48.610]
Holy moly, but guess what yeah, she's still really ugly. Oh, yeah, she in fact, she could live in Montreal easy

[02:51:50.250 --> 02:51:55.530]
They invited me they said oh come on over here and stay here. We we and I said no, thank you. Well sure

[02:51:57.250 --> 02:51:57.610]
I

[02:51:57.610 --> 02:52:05.070]
Speak and I'm lovely people as the Osborne is told a British news paper that he was sexually molested repeatedly as a child and suffered emotional effects from the abuse long into adulthood

[02:52:05.070 --> 02:52:09.010]
How do you like that? Do you know that that explains everything? Did you know that no now? You do?

[02:52:09.150 --> 02:52:13.290]
I read it anybody says this is not an educational program man. You're full of it

[02:52:13.290 --> 02:52:18.670]
You're full of Schmidt like that and what are they doing with all these nealisms on a goddamn promos now? Have you noticed this?

[02:52:18.830 --> 02:52:22.950]
Yes, I noticed one a little bit earlier and now it's starting to get out great on me a little bit

[02:52:23.710 --> 02:52:26.010]
That's great. No, it is not great

[02:52:27.210 --> 02:52:30.810]
Jesus K Christ man. What else wrong with you people anyway?

[02:52:32.250 --> 02:52:36.370]
Ozzy who grew up in a working class neighborhood of Birmingham that's England not Alabama

[02:52:37.230 --> 02:52:41.490]
Said two older youth began abusing him after school when he was 11 and continued on a regular basis

[02:52:42.070 --> 02:52:43.630]
He's quoted a saying in the daily mirror

[02:52:44.370 --> 02:52:50.810]
He told the paper was afraid to report the instance to his parents and only this year began to come to terms with the emotional effects of the abuse

[02:52:51.830 --> 02:52:57.790]
Everything when you're a kid affects you later in life said Osborne the former black Sabbath lead singer if you build an F and wall with every

[02:52:57.790 --> 02:52:58.710]
But no he didn't say that

[02:52:58.710 --> 02:53:04.590]
If you build a wall with rocky foundations, you're gonna have a pretty unstable F and wall when it's finished

[02:53:04.590 --> 02:53:05.050]
He said

[02:53:06.550 --> 02:53:11.750]
Osborne last month post-border plan European turtle next year because he defects of medication. He's taken to treat tremors

[02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:17.530]
He and his family have enjoyed a higher profile since they opened up their home life for the MTV reality series

[02:53:17.530 --> 02:53:20.930]
The Osborne's now on his third season. I got a question to ask about them. Okay

[02:53:21.610 --> 02:53:24.210]
I was channel surfamol was in Montreal on the CTV

[02:53:24.730 --> 02:53:29.990]
Which is a Canadian network. They carry that show the Osborne's and they don't leave anything out

[02:53:29.990 --> 02:53:35.510]
On CTV right lucky you it's not a cable channel. Let's it over the air channel

[02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:39.850]
Okay, so why do they why do they do that? I guess because it's candidate right?

[02:53:40.310 --> 02:53:45.670]
But I mean he's not saying F in this I mean he's saying the words man and they don't well went in doubt. They don't leave it out

[02:53:46.190 --> 02:53:52.490]
Or he says he can't handle it there. That's the Canadian F and way right as opposed to the very repressive American

[02:53:52.490 --> 02:53:54.330]
In that's right way

[02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:58.330]
We're so privileged to be so protected right, which is why that words

[02:53:59.190 --> 02:54:02.010]

Like you later if at all and

[02:59:40.770 --> 02:59:45.850]

It was in Paris. Yeah, just like there the French speaking people in Quebec in Montreal will go and the no extra length to help you out

[02:59:53.050 --> 02:59:55.990]

Pretty obnoxious and Montreal like I've told you folks before is living proof that that whole bilingual thing doesn't work by

Sexual works. Yes bilingual does not work. Okay. Maybe by cunneling will that might work, but bilingual does it work? No?

Surprise I've ever seen in my life in other with he knew exactly what was going on

[03:02:00.370 --> 03:02:05.010]
And Dr. Phil came in and he changed the chairs with the oh, I just can't believe this. I'm so shocked

[03:02:05.010 --> 03:02:06.770]
Uh, wink wink nudge

[03:02:07.890 --> 03:02:12.210]
But I'm sitting there watching Regis and I like Regis, you know other than his Notre Dame thing

[03:02:12.210 --> 03:02:13.870]
I like Regis a lot. I've always said that

[03:02:13.870 --> 03:02:17.930]
He's a good guy had to put up with can't he Lee all those years. What's not to like?

[03:02:17.930 --> 03:02:21.250]
But I look at him sitting there. I know he's had one heart attack

[03:02:22.690 --> 03:02:27.830]
And I'm thinking okay, when does that time come when does the little message in your head finally say Regis?

[03:02:28.090 --> 03:02:33.450]
Okay, that's enough. I got million. I mean, I'm not talking about people who are struggling to save it up money to like be able to retire

[03:02:33.450 --> 03:02:39.190]
You know and who don't need it? I'm talking about somebody who makes millions and millions and millions and he's sitting there

[03:02:39.190 --> 03:02:43.450]
Right across somebody else who's made even more millions I believe which is really kind of a scary thing

[03:02:43.450 --> 03:02:46.450]
We know what a scumbag is I know how to do a torture. Yeah good

[03:02:46.450 --> 03:02:50.710]
And the two of them are sitting there. I'm thinking when is enough enough when you have enough money to finally say

[03:02:50.710 --> 03:02:53.790]
Okay, screw it. Let me just go enjoy whatever time I got left, you know

[03:02:54.910 --> 03:02:59.930]
