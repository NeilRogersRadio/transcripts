[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.500]
Morning, Neil. Morning, Scott. I'm giving away tennis balls, baseball tickets. I'm going to Debbie Reynolds hotel on Saturday night and

[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.260]
Miami legs otherwise known as Don Schuulis hotel. How much rooming? How much rooming did you have to do to get that story by Dave

[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.080]
Warmman City link man? This is a suck job. I never it's beautiful. You know, it is incredible. It's a byproduct of your brilliance clearly

[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.620]
The fact even even licked around the edges of my ass a little bit

[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.420]
You know, it's important I think to anything I do at this station if I'm not involved with you

[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.880]
I put into my contract with Mr. Reed that I just won't be involved in anything unless it's involved with you

[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.700]
Nothing at all. I will do nothing unless you know who most favorite baseball player was

[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.760]
Who's that?

[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.500]
Dear old dingalberry. You know, you love to work action

[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.820]
He's from I think you

[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.140]
Was that bad you need to start a cartoon

[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.840]
Dingalberry heights is where he lives

[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.760]
And you have a picture of him festing himself because that's what he does every day

[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.740]
This is the guy that you play golf with you. You need to win anyway

[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.500]
And you know my name as he calls me a mother-eifer

[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.980]
Every day when he sees it on rap all the slime all the time. I told him this morning the first words out of my mouth

[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.400]
Where he said so what's with you and I said on nothing I just bought my girlfriend a 16 inch banana dildo yesterday

[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.120]
Then he didn't know what the thing he just went home

[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.000]
He just went home. He's going home to peel it

[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.260]
You know, it's already peeled. That's a nice thing. That's the end of it. You just do a little bit of this

[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.520]
I'm not talking about banana either. Oh, anyway, there's a toward the end of this article

[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.380]
Which I'm gonna read this just I'm not gonna read the whole thing because we don't have that many hours

[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.700]
Take six toilets like a week of shows because like reading an entire playboy

[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.300]
Paragraphs in here looks to me like you're throwing Moana the truck

[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.160]
Go ahead. What do you say? Huh?

[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.220]
What does it say it says at 814 meaning you he breaks for a commercial removes his headphones and says I try to give them their

[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.800]
Money's worth three quick segments later. He says can you believe it's been an hour when the show has ended for well wiping sweat from his forehead says

[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.280]
Two hours is just not long enough contrasting an earlier opinion that less of me means more

[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.680]
See how it's right a minute wait a minute. Wait a minute. We're not interrupt

[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.660]
He can read between the lines whichever version for well-believe someone could easily envision a scenario in which his shows swallows two more hours

[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.300]
If you're a QAM, how do you hold back on a promoter so tireless he's willing to offer himself as bait

[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.000]
Inviting 150 listeners to I didn't know I've been offering my services to

[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.660]
You know God you

[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.680]
When you work one day a month now starting next week one day a year you know one day a month one day a year one day every other year

[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.720]
You know, I just whatever I can do to accommodate mr. Read in the locals here

[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:51.180]
So what's the follow from that we never got an update you were volunteering to fill in Monday Wednesday and Friday from 8 to noon for free

[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.640]
I don't know because it turns out they wanted to talk about it yesterday

[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.880]
But clearance and duck both went and had the rectums checked oh, yeah, yeah, who's was cleaner turns out duffs

[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.340]
And I ducked ended up liking the drugs a lot more than clearance clearance didn't even say hi to me this morning

[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.480]
I understand that there's like traffic signs in dust

[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.280]
Oh my god, there is there's actually about you know those long lights like at 441 and I just there is like one way signs

[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.000]
Yeah, there's no you turns

[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.880]
Uh-huh

[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.680]
I'm telling you know my favorite one slippery one wet and a bridge freezes first

[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.100]
He came in this morning. He gave me his daily health report

[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.060]
Duffy so they actually found something in there. I said well, what a surprise that is it actually was the

[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.940]
Pallips that I have on my throat cords

[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.580]
His rectum polyps well

[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.500]
Listen, it's since it's not for a first break

[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.360]
Have a great day Scott have a great day Neil. See ya

[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.700]
Don't you go back to Canada you too fast

[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.580]
Meet

[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.240]
I eat like a man

[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.800]
Meet makes you grow up bigger strong like Neil

[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.280]
What's that you got I got sped

[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.800]
That's this I can dunk it without tripping

[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.020]
You eat like a pussy like a girl like a spider

[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.000]
I am being a boy. I like food

[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.020]
I like this

[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.300]
Oh

[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.900]
It's

[00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.480]
I'm gonna have to go to the toilet.

[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.480]
That's gonna happen to Clarence too.

[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.380]
Yeah, you talk about women all the time.

[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.740]
You only talk about men.

[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.140]
I don't know what to do anymore.

[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.060]
I'm gonna have to go to the toilet.

[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.480]
Maybe I can get a gig singin' book of Ryan's songs.

[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.980]
Tell me, tell me, you scam me.

[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.380]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.160]
He scares me too, I'll tell you.

[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.920]
10.07 at 5.60 WQM, my worst safe being aboard your job is secure.

[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.680]
Because quite frankly, if they don't want the bedtime stories anymore, you're out.

[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.820]
I mean, what do we need you for if I'm not gonna do the bedtime stories?

[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.740]
Yeah, think about it.

[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.920]
Put on your thinking cap. Think of a good answer.

[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.600]
I like food.

[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.220]
Okay.

[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.560]
Here's the poll result from yesterday.

[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.160]
Should Neil keep posting the bedtime stories on the website?

[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.440]
Now, it's very obvious to me that some of the people who voted in some of the other categories were just doing it to bring down our total under 50%.

[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.020]
Didn't work.

[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.400]
53%.

[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.460]
How do you like that?

[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.100]
Actually, I think that's about as high as we were.

[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.140]
860 and out of 5,838 say, absolutely.

[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.600]
I want to give you a kiss.

[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.380]
No, that's not it.

[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.840]
Absolutely.

[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.280]
Close.

[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.660]
816 said yes, it's important.

[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.320]
Keep pumping out those bedtime stories.

[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.500]
But see a lot of the right wingers, the 50 or 60 that we got, they were voting the other categories.

[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.620]
Because they'd like to detour us from putting something on every side of the usual right wing panel.

[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.580]
I'd rather see more naked pictures, 303.

[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.480]
I rarely read them, 164.

[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.700]
I only care about the poll, 118.

[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:47.800]
I don't need to read lots of news websites, 82, 5.3% on a snooty side.

[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.640]
See, that's a snooty response and I put it on there because I knew some of you would vote that.

[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.580]
What would I don't need them?

[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.800]
I read lots of news websites.

[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.440]
What does that mean?

[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.340]
They don't need them.

[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.080]
No, it means that they're smarter than us.

[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.680]
As opposed to, well, you know, maybe I'm not going to read them, but a lot of other people don't have time to read all of this.

[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.220]
See what I'm saying?

[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.540]
Yeah.

[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.140]
Rather than adopting that attitude, they want to show us how much more intellectual they are than us.

[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.520]
And I most think you're about the goofy stuff, 55 of our audience, out of 1,538.

[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:15.960]
Not bad.

[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.840]
So what do you think about for RL6 to 10?

[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.840]
See what I'm thinking is probably what's going to happen.

[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.180]
And I'm just thinking out loud.

[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.980]
Or what I'm thinking is what should happen when football season starts, which isn't really all that far away,

[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.380]
a couple of months before those exhibitionist games start.

[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.840]
When's the first off an exhibition game?

[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.000]
Anybody know?

[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.080]
No.

[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.860]
Well, you could look it up.

[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.100]
You could look at Miami Dolphins on the internet there since you got my nice pewter that you're sitting there dealing with.

[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.240]
And don't be downloading any goddamn music while you're sitting there either being a boy, please.

[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:48.660]
Okay.

[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.520]
The last thing we need is a raid.

[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.440]
Pretty season, August 8th.

[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.160]
August 8th.

[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.280]
So like I said, oh, it's only a month and a half away.

[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.860]
The first exhibitionist game.

[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.260]
I'm thinking with the Dolphins season starting pretty soon.

[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.340]
Mo, you know, he needs to concentrate being a daughter of an old man.

[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.160]
And I need to focus all of his energies on those play by play game.

[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.600]
Don't you think?

[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:09.900]
Okay.

[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.160]
So what I'm thinking is that maybe they come to some kind of an accommodation with the old man.

[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.340]
You know, write them a check, two bucks.

[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.760]
And say, okay, that's it.

[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.240]
Just concentrate on the Dolphins thing.

[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.920]
And we'll put Joe and Mark back two to six.

[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.800]
And we'll put Farahla on six to ten.

[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.180]
And take all the heat off of your old ass.

[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.040]
Do you think that's a possibility?

[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.500]
Possibility.

[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.280]
Because this story in CityLynch, and if you want to read the whole story on Farahla,

[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.260]
which if you got a few extra hours, it's like reading a book, but it's great.

[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.500]
Dave Warham, who also gives me a couple of nice stuff.

[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.980]
Thanks a lot Dave, you're okay in my book.

[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.340]
I told you, CityLynch was great.

[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.220]
And you're saying, ah, they screwed you over.

[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.720]
You know, you're always like driving a wedge between me and everybody else.

[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.320]
That's me.

[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.540]
Because you're insecure.

[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.640]
You're afraid that if I, you know, I get to see with anybody else, then we'll blow your ass out.

[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.040]
But anyway, Dave Warham, it says if NeoRanges is God's God for all must be Satan.

[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.540]
Absolutely correct.

[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.580]
And the front cover, anyway, you can go to the website citylinkmagazine.com.

[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.520]
Citylinkmagazine.com.

[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.060]
And you can't miss it because it's a big full color photo of Farahla looking at his very craziest.

[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.300]
Any article, like I said, goes on about six, seven hundred pages.

[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.100]
Makes that Hillary book, pale in a way, significance.

[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:23.980]
Oh, speaking of that.

[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.160]
See that?

[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:26.620]
Yeah.

[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.900]
How I fell into that crap?

[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.840]
Hillary book.

[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.320]
Here you go.

[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:29.840]
Page one.

[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.700]
Here's the last paragraph from page one.

[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.340]
Oh, right.

[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:32.820]
Excellent.

[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.120]
Look what great progress we're making.

[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.600]
Let me ask you.

[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.000]
What do you think?

[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.780]
How about a page a week?

[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.420]
Right.

[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:42.920]
Yeah.

[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.320]
And there's about five hundred.

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.600]
Let me see how many actual pages there are in a Hillary book.

[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.520]
Five hundred and thirty-fold.

[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.440]
A page.

[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.960]
That's like about ten years, isn't it?

[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:55.680]
Huh?

[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.760]
I don't know.

[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.020]
That's about ten years.

[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.380]
Well, after the first three and a half, then I'll turn it over to your fine hands.

[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.160]
Oh, yeah.

[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.740]
Aren't you going to be doing the show when I hang it up?

[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.220]
Sure, right.

[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.460]
Come on.

[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.980]
Don't you think so being a boy that the Gregor come in and offer Georgia a real fat one?

[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:10.800]
Of course.

[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:11.520]
Yeah.

[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.820]
Although the Cold War was...

[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.940]
You're interrupting Hillary's penmanship here.

[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.260]
Very, very disrespectful.

[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.240]
Although the Cold War was beginning with the Soviet Union in the Eastern Europe,

[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.540]
my parents and their generation felt secure and hopeful.

[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.320]
Americans of supremacy with the result, not just a military might, but of our values,

[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.440]
and of the abundant opportunities available to people like my parents who worked hard and took responsibility.

[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.260]
Middle class America was flush with emerging prosperity and all that comes with it.

[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.740]
New houses, fine schools, neighborhood parks, and safe communities.

[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.280]
There it is.

[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.480]
Right the end of page one of Hillary's book, Living History by Hillary Rodham Clinton.

[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.000]
Oh.

[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.200]
Always about eighty pounds.

[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:54.280]
Yeah, this line in the Ferell's interview here, the article about Ferell and City Link is a dead giveaway.

[00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:01.800]
Whichever version he believes someone could easily envision a scenario in which his show swallows two more hours.

[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:02.480]
All right.

[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:09.760]
If your WQAM, how do you hold back on a promoter so tireless, he's willing to offer himself as bait,

[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.120]
inviting 150 listeners to I hate the meds night at P.P. Park or 1500 listeners on a booze cruise.

[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:21.140]
How do you not piggyback a guy who's turned out to be an excellent setup man for station Haas Neo Rodgers?

[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.180]
I thought I was a gorilla now, Mahas.

[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.080]
Yeah.

[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:31.160]
How do you not make the most of a once loose cannon who appears to have found a comfort zone many come by only after joining AA or finding Jesus?

[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.960]
What a great article Dave.

[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.760]
Horm nice going out.

[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.680]
Love City Link magazine.

[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:35.260]
They love us.

[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.300]
They love me. They love Scott.

[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.720]
They're not too crazy about George.

[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:38.980]
What?

[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.240]
They gave me one of those awards, weren't they?

[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.260]
Just a little joke.

[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.260]
It's just a joke.

[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.180]
What's wrong with you?

[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.400]
Why are you so defensive? Is it because you work for Greg?

[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:46.900]
Uh huh.

[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.200]
Was that it?

[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.620]
Anybody in the audience so wonder why George has been so defensive all these years because he knows that's what it is.

[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.360]
That's what it is.

[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.440]
That's the bottom. That's all you need to know.

[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.620]
1013 at 560 WQAM, Barbecue's Galore.

[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.440]
Boy in the summertime if you don't have a barbecue your S.O.L. What do you do?

[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:10.600]
Barbecue's Galore carries the biggest range of Weber grills in the accessory starting with a Weber smokey dual portable charcoal grill for under 28 bucks.

[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.740]
It's the perfect grill for any picnic especially on the 4th of July.

[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.400]
And nobody can beat Barbecue's galore's incredible selection of top quality grills.

[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:23.340]
They carry a full line of grills including Weber, Viking, Jenny, or Braille mate, lots of exclusive grills like the Turbo.

[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.980]
Barbecue's chef Cook on the Campton Cook, all of the guaranteed lowest prices.

[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.460]
Right now take advantage of no payments in his cash financing until January 2004 on approved credit.

[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.140]
This way take you home the amazing three burner Cook on grill.

[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:43.240]
A Barbecue's Galore exclusive. It comes with the host of great features normally only once found at more expensive grills like 42,000 powerful BTUs.

[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.520]
Porcelain coated cast iron burners and cooking grills and a generous 625 square inch cooking area.

[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:54.820]
I guarantee you won't find another grill like it for this price not only 349 bucks and you'll only find this one at Barbecue's Galore.

[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.180]
Another one perfect for that 4th of July cookout.

[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.820]
Don't forget Barbecue's Galore is the place all the top brands have beatable prices.

[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.760]
Their America's best barbecue store with stores in plantation.

[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:14.560]
On university, Dravena found shopping center called 954 4234 400 and a crawl springs on a corner sample in Rock Island roads called 954 7576668.

[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:20.900]
Everything you need under the sun for Barbecue in this one incredible store. Barbecue's Galore be sure and tell them that ancient kneels sent you in.

[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.100]
My life and look all this is 420560.

[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.240]
You ain't too way, yeah.

[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.520]
No!

[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.000]
Were you fudge back in?

[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:31.260]
Yeah!

[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:37.760]
Oof!

[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.580]
The root off the scum bag bomb her.

[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:49.900]
He was hiding in the woods, living like an animal just like a white supremacian.

[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:56.840]
He is the creep who's wanted for lighting the Olympic fuse.

[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.680]
You asshole!

[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:03.460]
And for blowing up people who thought they had a right to choose.

[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.940]
And then one steamy summer's heat.

[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:13.800]
The root off came to town while looking for some dumpster food.

[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.960]
A cop said freeze or I will shoot.

[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.060]
Now that the feds have caught him.

[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.960]
He's hiding in a jail cell.

[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.400]
Root off the scum bag bomber.

[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.360]
Soon you're gonna fry in hell.

[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.420]
All the crap you can unwrap.

[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.200]
All the slime all the time.

[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.440]
1019 at 560 W.Q.

[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.100]
Got some good news today to get started.

[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.760]
I'm always happy to report some good news.

[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.780]
Less dramatic's is dead.

[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.120]
Alright!

[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.160]
Segregationists became Georgia governor.

[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.040]
Lester Manis, the restaurant tour whose segregationist defiance propelled them into the governorship.

[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.620]
In a fluke election in the 60s died yesterday.

[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.160]
It was 87.

[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.520]
That's old enough for him.

[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.640]
And then some.

[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.220]
Manis who had battled cancer since 1993 cracked two ribs earlier this month when he fell out and assisted living home.

[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.740]
Where it was recovering from surgery.

[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.180]
He later developed pneumonia and died.

[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.020]
See that's bad.

[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.660]
I shouldn't be like saying that should I?

[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:08.300]
What?

[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.380]
It is good.

[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:18.380]
A high school dropout born in a working class six of Atlanta, Mattis gave national notoriety for chasing away blacks from his pick-rich-fri chicken restaurant in Atlanta in July 64.

[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.460]
The day after the civil rights act was signed into law, he closed and then sold pick-rich rather than served blacks.

[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.660]
But fears of racial striptoring as 1967 to 1971 governorship proved unfounded.

[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.420]
When Mattis pursued a policy of relative moderation on race, some even thought quite so good that he croaked.

[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:39.500]
But he had been chosen as governor by the legislature after no candidate received a majority of the votes cast in the 1966 selection.

[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.800]
That be got kind of like making colonel Sanders the governor of Florida if he was still alive.

[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.240]
And you know what?

[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.680]
Big improvement.

[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.980]
Free chicken for everybody.

[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.540]
Let's hear it.

[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:48.680]
Oh!

[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.120]
If the colonel was a governor, instead of the bonehead you got speaking to bonehead bush people.

[00:15:54.260 --> 00:16:03.400]
President Bush called on Congress yesterday to make it easier for federally financed religious groups to base their having decisions on a job candidate's religion and sexual orientated.

[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:12.640]
A White House position paper sent to Capitol Hill argued that religious hiring rights are part of religious, but they're out of it.

[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.800]
So it'll be back in.

[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.000]
So must be pretty popular.

[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:16.740]
It's good.

[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:24.740]
Here's one that says four stars, name of the rose, great movie with Sean Connery, Ron Pearlman, Christian Slater, nothing's perfect, F. Murray Abraham.

[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:35.140]
Excellent movie about suppression of humor to control the masses via murder in a Catholic monastery in medieval Spanish inquisition times must see no DVD yet.

[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.060]
Just get the tape.

[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.300]
Well, thank you, Larry.

[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.340]
Also movie called The Beast with Jason Patrick and Rodney something.

[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.360]
And the US.

[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.080]
Yes, and Stephen Bauer.

[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.140]
And our good buddy Rocky, it's your Maria aka Stephen Bauer.

[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:53.640]
See, it's funny that should happen because I was just thinking about him the other day about the first time I met him at a Panther game.

[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.400]
Right.

[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.560]
Remember I talked about that.

[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.280]
Then we had him on IODs against on the show.

[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.280]
But I met him at a Panther game.

[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.020]
He came up and hugged me like we were going to do something.

[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.300]
I mean, he was like his long lost best friend.

[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.360]
He was a pretty good guy.

[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.240]
He said his ups and downs.

[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.840]
He had his little bit of a nose problem there for a while.

[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:10.920]
But again, you know,

[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.120]
on first blush, I would say I like him.

[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:14.660]
He's a good guy.

[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:15.260]
He's a good guy.

[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.060]
He got it just like Donnie Osman since we're named drop.

[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.340]
And I thought he was a good guy.

[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.500]
Now were you there then?

[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:21.940]
Was that a.

[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.380]
They know something.

[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:24.360]
Huh?

[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.420]
Oh, the Zayda or something.

[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.300]
What was that on Zayda?

[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.100]
It was an IOD, but it was pre-George days.

[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.780]
It was either Marfon or maybe it was maybe it was Nick.

[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.320]
What it is.

[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.520]
Yeah, I might have been.

[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.840]
Yeah, I can still get the aroma.

[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.580]
Might have been old Nick.

[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.360]
Those were the days, baby.

[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.520]
Those were we did the days once upon a time.

[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.080]
But now we're entering a new era.

[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.640]
As Ferelle brings a little bit of fun back to QM.

[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.820]
God, oh, what a, what a breath of fresh air.

[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.600]
Even if you hate his voice, even if you can't stand his foul language.

[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.020]
What a breath of fresh air it is for all of us.

[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.020]
Just have a little fun back.

[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.500]
It was getting so staggy.

[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.520]
Isn't that is that a word staggy?

[00:17:59.200 --> 00:17:59.740]
Check it in.

[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.800]
Oh my God, it was getting so uptight.

[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.280]
All the crap you can unwrap.

[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.000]
All the slime all the time.

[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.420]
I talked about that many times.

[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.340]
People didn't believe me.

[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.600]
They think I'm always exaggerating.

[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.400]
That's exactly the way it was in the hallways and the byways and the freeways.

[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.240]
Of a QAM.

[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.400]
Everybody was like walking on eggshells.

[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.060]
Oh, mold like being a hallway.

[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.880]
Mose out there.

[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.240]
Readjusting his package.

[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.000]
Mose out there.

[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:20.700]
Pickin' dingalberries.

[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.320]
Everybody's a little bit nervous.

[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.580]
You should have heard the beast.

[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.680]
Boy, you talk about a real backstair.

[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.980]
Or you should have heard him this morning.

[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.400]
Before our show comes in.

[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.640]
Just about the mode digging for dingalberries.

[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.720]
Not disgusting it was.

[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.620]
And all this other crap.

[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.460]
Which he's right about that.

[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.420]
And I still say, I think you ought to cut him a little slack.

[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.460]
Like maybe he is readjusting the tube.

[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.240]
Do you ever think about that?

[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.700]
It occurred to me.

[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:46.080]
You know.

[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.660]
I don't want to think about it too much.

[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.600]
But he might just be readjusting the old rectum tube.

[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.040]
Look for the QAM van today.

[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:56.820]
New Deal 1PM.

[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.860]
It Austin's dive shop in Miami at where?

[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.200]
At 105.25 South Dixie Highway.

[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:03.140]
Stop out of here.

[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.320]
Your free Marlon tickets.

[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.900]
The real yellow pages from Bellsoft.

[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.520]
Marlon's under 500 again.

[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.140]
I don't know if that's for all that mentioned that to me.

[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.260]
They lost last night.

[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.160]
They can't win every day.

[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.340]
They were on pretty good rule there.

[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.700]
But they're under 500 again.

[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.440]
And they can't play girls' things every day either.

[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.680]
In fact, oh look at that.

[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.640]
They're playing the meds again.

[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.660]
What is this?

[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.500]
Do the Marlins and the meds play each other every day?

[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.240]
The rest of the season?

[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.740]
Oh hell, they got a shot then.

[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.520]
Every damn day they're playing either the other.

[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.180]
Oh, they're playing at the red socks tomorrow.

[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.740]
Well, oh and guess what?

[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:33.900]
Did you look at tomorrow's schedule?

[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.320]
Oh, I'm in the other room.

[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:36.800]
Woo!

[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.760]
Let me give you 85 guesses who's filling in for

[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.020]
EDK EDK after the game tomorrow night.

[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:43.680]
I give you one clue.

[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.060]
It's Bobby Stupid!

[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.220]
Oh, Jacob.

[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.680]
Tom Jicke is filling in for EDK tomorrow night.

[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.720]
Well, that be a hoot.

[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.900]
I encourage everybody to call him in and rip him an ass.

[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.960]
Not for anything specific.

[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.120]
Just out of general principle.

[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.080]
Just rip him an ass.

[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.200]
Because yeah, in fact, I encourage a lot.

[00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.180]
I even know you won't do it.

[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.860]
Because I have no influence over the audience whatsoever.

[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.880]
Call him up and ask him how Jerry Williams is doing.

[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.440]
Look at that, Venus boys.

[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.560]
We close out the pool.

[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:07.940]
53%.

[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.080]
And you know something that may not sound like overwhelming.

[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.220]
But that is a pretty good number.

[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.240]
And I think that's like a micro-casm of this entire program.

[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:15.820]
You realize that?

[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.960]
53% of the audience, little over half,

[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:18.880]
a lot of bedtime stories.

[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.540]
They think it's important that it's a...

[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:20.880]
Absolutely.

[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.260]
...neccessary to have them on there.

[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.880]
And then there's like the other 47%.

[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.060]
That doesn't give a flying crap about that.

[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.280]
So it's the fine line we draw.

[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.140]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:30.380]
Yes.

[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.380]
Between saving the world and...

[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.060]
...and stuff like that.

[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:34.780]
5.

[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.380]
The local.

[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.820]
This is 5.

[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:37.240]
City.

[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.040]
The radio's on your town.

[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.080]
Q&A.

[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.760]
We're out here on the streets of the city,

[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.920]
asking people what they do for a condi-bar.

[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:49.920]
Excuse me, sir.

[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:50.280]
Yeah?

[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.040]
What would you do for a condi-bar?

[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:52.920]
I don't know.

[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:53.600]
Would you kiss me?

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.260]
Kiss you.

[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.240]
Just a quick pack on the cheek.

[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.880]
It's for a condi-bar.

[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:57.660]
Okay.

[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.680]
Okay, give me my condi-bar.

[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.980]
Oh, you can do better than that.

[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:01.360]
I mean.

[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.340]
Kiss me full on the lips.

[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:02.820]
For the lips.

[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:03.680]
For a condi-bar.

[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.100]
Okay.

[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.220]
Now give me that condi-bar.

[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.040]
People are starting to look.

[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.660]
Alright, I'll give you your condi-bar.

[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.620]
But first you have to kiss me open mouth

[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.120]
with your tongue tickling my uvula.

[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.580]
It's for a condi-bar.

[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.440]
Oh, God.

[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:19.360]
Okay.

[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:21.860]
Oh, God.

[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:22.040]

[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:22.040]

[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.120]
Why are you looking at ladies for a condi-bar?

[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.480]
Yes, about that.

[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.000]
What?

[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.960]
Well, you see I don't actually have a condi-bar.

[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.440]
You know?

[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.020]
No, but it was very nice meeting you.

[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.140]
Very, very nice.

[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.180]
I'm going to kill you.

[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.520]
Shock like coated ice cream.

[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.460]
So rich and thick.

[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:37.640]
There's no room for a stick.

[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.900]
Who would you do for a condi-bar?

[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.120]
The reason I'm playing that.

[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:42.900]
If you only knew.

[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:44.880]
I'm going to ask you this question.

[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.840]
You know what everybody knows what a condi-bar is, right?

[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:47.500]
Right.

[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.000]
We know the size of it, the shape, we know the composition.

[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.220]
It's got that tin layer of...

[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.960]
I'm talking about just a plain ordinary pedestrian condi-bar.

[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:54.300]
Right.

[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:54.840]
Original one.

[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.160]
Sure.

[00:21:55.580 --> 00:22:00.360]
Thin-thin layer of chocolate on the outside of very pedestrian-vinyl ice cream, right?

[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:00.780]
Okay.

[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.340]
Not exciting, but it's okay.

[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:02.960]
Sure.

[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.820]
Now, remember I told you how they found they have a new...

[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.380]
A Klondike score.

[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:09.580]
Oh no.

[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:10.980]
Bar.

[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.840]
I know where this is going.

[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:13.760]
Yes, you do.

[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.940]
But I'm the only one in the world that would admit this right on the year.

[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.700]
Right to the public to our vast audience, okay?

[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.760]
Because I have no shame.

[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.900]
When you're a fat slob and when you're addicted to sugar, I have no shame.

[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.580]
All you drug addicts out there and all you alcoholics I take back, everything I've ever said.

[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.740]
I think you better strap yourself in for this story.

[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.380]
You noticed I didn't tend to this before the show?

[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:32.700]
No.

[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.280]
I was saving it for on the year.

[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.160]
Now, how many if you were really starving, okay?

[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:45.480]
If you really were just out of your mind for something good, for a nice snack, how many Klondike bars do you think you could eat?

[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:46.400]
Three.

[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.160]
Baby four.

[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.560]
I like food.

[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.860]
So anyway, I go to a dominion yesterday, which is a beautiful supermarket.

[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:58.520]
And they have the Klondike score bars, which is the, it looks the same.

[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.760]
It's got the chocolate on it outside.

[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:05.240]
But the ice cream inside is that score stuff with somebody a toffee, a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a toffee.

[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:05.700]
Right.

[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.000]
I mean, inside.

[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.980]
So there are four to a box, okay?

[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.620]
There are four to a box.

[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.700]
I bought three boxes.

[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.080]
Not being, not having any self control or any common sense, I bought three boxes.

[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.480]
That's a dozen more.

[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:19.660]
Yeah.

[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.000]
Right.

[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:20.340]
Right.

[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:21.160]
Okay.

[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.360]
Well, I polished off the first box, those four in no time.

[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.680]
I'm sitting there watching the guiding light, passions, whatever I'm watching.

[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.080]
Oh my god.

[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.200]
I polished those off before you could say fat slug.

[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.680]
Before you could even say, I like food.

[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:33.120]
Yeah.

[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.560]
Now, yesterday last night, I'm watching Dan Rather, the CBS evening news.

[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.660]
I really haven't eaten much dinner because I'm thinking, yeah, eat all of that stuff.

[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.100]
I better not.

[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.260]
But I'll have one more.

[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:45.820]
Okay.

[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:47.500]
Yeah.

[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:53.080]
Actually, what I was doing was I was downloading all my great bedtime stories because I see the audience overwhelming want the bedtime stories.

[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.560]
So I'm getting some good stuff printed out and I'll have one more.

[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.840]
Well, one turned into two and two turned into three.

[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.800]
Are you keeping our yow in tabs on the little how many are we up to now?

[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:07.980]
Seven.

[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:08.560]
Okay.

[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.420]
At that point, I threw the wrapper into the waste basket here and I ran to my freezer.

[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.160]
I grabbed the two boxes that remained one full and one with one.

[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.140]
I threw them into a garbage bag and ran down a hall and threw it down the garbage.

[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.640]
Good plan to save myself.

[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.700]
I don't think I'd be here today.

[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.920]
Have you ever heard anything so grotesque and disgusting in your entire life?

[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:31.820]
Not lately.

[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:33.540]
Seven.

[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.260]
Seven condi-bars.

[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.240]
And not that I'm a Slav, it's just that I like food.

[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.600]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.720]
Especially delicious score stuff.

[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.480]
I'm hooked on score.

[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.580]
Anybody want to score?

[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:45.840]
No thanks.

[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.180]
Isn't that a disgusting story?

[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:47.640]
No.

[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:48.780]
It's the press.

[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.740]
Of course, beater boys probably puking his guts out because it's all surrounded by chocolate on the outside.

[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.100]
Oh.

[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.980]
Gagging with a... with a...

[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:56.120]
Poon.

[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.420]
Here's our pool question today.

[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.360]
On the fat Slavney arrived your show.

[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.960]
See, I just, you know, most people are into Nile.

[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.600]
Just like every time over the years I've ever tried to talk about the whole fat thing, it's a waste of time.

[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.660]
We'd be better off doing a movie show again.

[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.940]
Nobody... I'm the only one who has these problems.

[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.100]
The only one who has these problems.

[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.760]
All those other fat Slavs that we see, which is most of our audience and most of the population,

[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.720]
those people that they just have glandular problems, they have a slow metabolism,

[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.880]
they don't do these thing out things like I do.

[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:24.480]
Absolutely not.

[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:28.880]
I think the only person who would admit to stuff like this is probably the beast and we don't talk to him anymore,

[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.560]
so before the show when he's ripping Mo and ass.

[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.780]
Well, I'll tell you Mo was right about him.

[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:33.880]
He's not a friend of Mo.

[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.840]
Of course we aren't either, but not like him.

[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.700]
Man, he was... when I did that...

[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.740]
Wait, what's this with the mute?

[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.520]
It was a good line.

[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.360]
Daryl Dingelberry instead of Daryl Strawberry.

[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.780]
It was relatively amusing.

[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.140]
It was kind of... like that.

[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.700]
But did you hear him go fong and shortly and puking his gut sound?

[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.240]
The paramedics are still working on it.

[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.840]
Don't suck around me, beast.

[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.760]
It's too late for that.

[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.840]
And in that city link article, I know a lot of you will read it about Scott Farrell.

[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.360]
Boy, the beast sucks on so heavy duty, man.

[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.200]
It's just unbelievable.

[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:01.680]
It's a miracle.

[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.320]
Well, I guess when you're that big and round, you know, like a human vacuum cleaner.

[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.980]
Speaking of eating a lot, it's got a lot of suction there.

[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.640]
Here's our poll question today.

[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:11.840]
Which of these moves...

[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.280]
Now, do you think that...

[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.580]
Oh, that's not... he hasn't called online, too.

[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.260]
I was hoping that...

[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:15.720]
The retire.

[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:16.760]
I need you beyond there.

[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.040]
W-D-Q-I-M.

[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:19.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:20.360]
How you doing?

[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.040]
I didn't just speak with me.

[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:21.840]
Speaking.

[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:23.560]
Good morning, sir.

[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:24.620]
Good morning. How are you?

[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.440]
All right.

[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.020]
Love for real.

[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.760]
That's the first thing I want to say.

[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.360]
What do you think about six to ten for Scott?

[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.180]
You think that's...

[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.340]
I think that would be perfect.

[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.740]
And I'm not a sports talk listener.

[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.640]
I listen to the mad dog a little bit every now and then I listen to Hank.

[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.620]
You know, the minute they start with the...

[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:41.880]
The...

[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.440]
The...

[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:42.660]
The...

[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.820]
Who's going to draft a four-year-old...

[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:46.160]
Oh, yeah.

[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:46.880]
I've been a gardener.

[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.720]
You know, I just...

[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.080]
Bye-bye.

[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.540]
Oh, in fact, at the end of Mosho this morning, they were going around a room.

[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.240]
They're asking who's going to be the first pick in the NBA draft.

[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.720]
I just wanted to jump out the window.

[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.500]
I couldn't believe that.

[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.000]
I think people need to get a life, right?

[00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:58.180]
Yeah.

[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.720]
They don't understand the average person doesn't give a flying crap about that.

[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:02.180]
Yeah.

[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.840]
Who's the heat's first pick on a beat?

[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:04.640]
Who cares?

[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:05.380]
Yeah.

[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.020]
I don't think it is.

[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:10.000]
You were talking a couple of weeks ago about Easter eggs and I want to get movie intentions.

[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:10.620]
Right.

[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.140]
I'm not here.

[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:15.680]
Listen, whatever you like, man, because in the dog days of summer, I should already be on my two-day schedule.

[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.060]
I screwed up this year.

[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.540]
So I'm doing like penance here.

[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.100]
So whatever you want, that'll kill some good time.

[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.080]
You're not...

[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:21.860]
At least you're not here.

[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:23.260]
Thank God.

[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.120]
I'm here.

[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.760]
The Easter egg thing, you asked about what the whole thing was.

[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.720]
It has a lot to do with...

[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.640]
Again, people who have no lives have to look for the little Easter eggs and the deep rice.

[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:40.320]
And it complicates the hell out of menus.

[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.500]
You know, the menus that come up.

[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:49.620]
So some of the older players end up not being able to play the DVDs because of all that

[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.240]
embedded stuff in there.

[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:51.680]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.760]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.680]
And it makes...

[00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:00.820]
And I'll tell you, this is interesting because I bought and watched directly in for a green.

[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.420]
And I watched it with my girlfriend.

[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:10.040]
And if you think it's hard enough for somebody to make that movie out, try to put yourself

[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.040]
in the place where somebody was totally blind and having it described to them.

[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.500]
I mean, I got totally lost about three or four times.

[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.080]
We have to go back and she had to tell me, okay, this is what's happening.

[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.660]
This is what's going on because I mean, it is just...

[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.800]
But it's an amazing movie, man.

[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.200]
It is really an incredible movie.

[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.600]
So you're totally blind and you watch DVDs?

[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:29.960]
Yeah.

[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:31.900]
What's somebody explaining it to you?

[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.840]
Well, sometimes, and sometimes, depending on the movie, depending on what it is, sometimes

[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.460]
I can catch what's going on.

[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:44.420]
But it just makes the menus, the Easter egg thing, makes the menus a real pin of the ass.

[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.060]
I'll be damned.

[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.140]
I am amazed at...

[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.520]
I mean, I understand.

[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.340]
You have said it before that sugar is your addiction, but I am amazed that you could eat

[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.360]
seven corn bars.

[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.340]
Seven corn.

[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.640]
And now it wasn't all in one sitting, four in the first sitting and three in the next

[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.600]
one, but within a period of maybe like three, four hours.

[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:04.880]
Seven.

[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.500]
I have a box that I've had in there for two weeks and I've only taken one.

[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:16.180]
But I'm addicted to nicotine and I'm addicted to caffeine, so I guess I can understand

[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.180]
how somebody can be addicted to caffeine.

[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.380]
I'm going to tell you, I'm going to say it again, nobody will believe me, but I've never

[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.140]
done heroin or any hard drugs, but I guarantee you that there is no addiction in the world

[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.740]
that is more overwhelming and compelling than sugar.

[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.160]
I don't care what anybody says.

[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.080]
That certainly seems like it's a man.

[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:35.820]
I find friends who are like you who can sit down and just eat a whole pint of fish food.

[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.080]
A whole half gallon, yeah.

[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.700]
Well, let's have a great show, Neil.

[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.820]
Keep in mind with a condi-par, do it like vitamins one a day.

[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:43.720]
There you go.

[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:44.680]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.360]
Take a look.

[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:52.420]
It's several rogers on the radio, see, 55 blonde.

[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:52.960]
Hey, Faris.

[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.780]
See, I'm admit that though, nobody else would.

[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.760]
You're all a bunch of cool season.

[00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:57.260]
Huh?

[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:57.860]
Genetic.

[00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:58.720]
It's all genetics, man.

[00:29:59.100 --> 00:29:59.500]
No, it's not.

[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.620]
It's being a fat slob.

[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.360]
You think that's what it is?

[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.240]
Is it mommy's fault?

[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.340]
It's your fault, ma.

[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.820]
You made me a fat, like, like Dom Deleway said in Fantzo.

[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.080]
How do you like your chubby baby now, ma?

[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.720]
Wasn't that the line pretty close?

[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:11.800]

[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:12.980]
What do you think of your chubby baby?

[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.940]
What do you think of your chubby baby?

[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.040]
Oh, my.

[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.760]
Oh, God.

[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:18.980]
It's pathetic.

[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.340]
Get the honey, Junior.

[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.680]
Here's our poll question today.

[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.840]
I only wish that one other beat me.

[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.100]
In fact, if there's anybody out there that can top me,

[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.040]
we ought to have a contest.

[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.840]
I've already done my part.

[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.700]
Am I going to do that again?

[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.500]
Because I wouldn't survive.

[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.120]
If we all for the food for free,

[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.860]
yeah, we'd have no end of contestants.

[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.140]
You know something you're right.

[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.720]
We'd have him lined up from there to God damn Jacksonville.

[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.840]
Oh, you give it away free, Condypaurus.

[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.480]
Well, we're not going to talk about it

[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.220]
because we're embarrassed,

[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.920]
but we'll combine E15 or 20.

[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.240]
I guarantee you, we could fill that stadium that way.

[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.300]
Yeah, we'll put that Pharrell to Shamero's Dan Marlin tickets.

[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.540]
Which of these moves by WQM do you like the most?

[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.660]
That's our poll question today.

[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.180]
Mogey Chubby back in the...

[00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.300]
This is a tough one, by the way.

[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.060]
Mogey Chubby back in hour.

[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.940]
Pharrell gets the 8 to 10 slot.

[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.660]
The ill goes back to 10 to 2.

[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.220]
Mad Dog moves to 2 to 4.

[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.920]
Hank loses in hour or no more Crow on the Marlin games.

[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.520]
Now you see what I'm saying?

[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.640]
What are it's going to be a tough choice?

[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.480]
Because obviously, and we're not going to give them the easy out.

[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.200]
Like all of the above or not,

[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.160]
we're not going to forget about that.

[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.040]
I'm tired of the kind of pussy voting

[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.240]
that some of these people want to do it.

[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.500]
It's like when they take a poll, you know,

[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.980]
what do you like better death or life?

[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.580]
And then there's always like 2% no opinion, you know?

[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:27.960]
What else is that?

[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.780]
How can you have no opinion?

[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.400]
Which of these moves by WQM do you like the most?

[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.600]
Mogey Chubby back in hour.

[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.400]
Pharrell gets the 8 to 10 slot.

[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.140]
Neil goes back to 10 to 2.

[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.600]
Mad Dog moves to 2 to 4.

[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.160]
Hank loses in hour, same pay by the way,

[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.200]
and no more Crow on his Marlin game.

[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.560]
Fiking.

[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.740]
Oh no, my blue baby car.

[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.620]
License of registration please.

[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.040]
Hola, I am Carlos.

[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.640]
License and registration.

[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:04.960]
You do not understand.

[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.860]
I am Carlos, world famous Innerboy.

[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.900]
BDB, BDB, BDC.

[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.920]
I play with you for no extra charge.

[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.260]
License and registration.

[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.040]
Do you like the who I am?

[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.560]
Deploy from the vehicle.

[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.260]
It is I.

[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.780]
Deploy from the vehicle.

[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.720]
Now with your license and registration please.

[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.240]
These things I do not have, but it is not a vehicle.

[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.160]
It is my blue baby, hang us.

[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.640]
All right, hang behind the back.

[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.160]
Do not touch me.

[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.360]
You are searching my little cavity.

[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.480]
Have a problem with that.

[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.840]
No, you will find it is very clean.

[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.080]
Man, we're taking you downtown.

[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.820]
Where are the lights, are bright?

[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.020]
Let's go Innerboy.

[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.360]
Wait, wait, wait.

[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.620]
Don't they get the phone call?

[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.000]
All right, but make a quick.

[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:45.820]
It's in my sack, Julia.

[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.480]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.700]
I think that strip is told me for.

[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.180]
All right, Vina Boy, let's go.

[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.440]
I said that you were 50 years.

[00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.300]
For being a public annoyance.

[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.720]
You can't come in me, you win.

[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:01.960]
Thank you, Julia.

[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:05.820]
You win.

[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:06.840]
Where's the lioness?

[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.400]
I am here to protect you.

[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:09.520]
I lost him in there.

[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.180]
Hey, there's this thing.

[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.480]
This is not a good thing.

[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.040]
What do you know?

[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:14.880]
What are you saying?

[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.260]
What are you in here for more?

[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.080]
That was my Marquilla's snack, too.

[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.560]
I was good on fighting.

[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:20.520]
But I couldn't fight.

[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.460]
So I killed Zack for good vision.

[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.460]
Please do not hurt me.

[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.020]
Hey, Tyte.

[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:24.820]
You, please go to bed.

[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.580]
Get along in a fresh, no meat over here.

[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.500]
Go ahead, missum jibbess.

[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.540]
Go ahead, missum jibbess.

[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.180]
I'm all ahead, missum jibbess.

[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:31.960]
Why sure?

[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.360]
We're going to have you some jibbess right now.

[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:35.680]
Go.

[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.660]
Get the brook steak, Tyson.

[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.320]
I got the chicken.

[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.480]
I got the cheese, don't ask.

[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.980]
The boy I told you he was good.

[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.680]
He's smell like David Tathur.

[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.040]
Don't smell like David Tathur.

[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:45.680]
I know.

[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.220]
Makes me so horny.

[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:47.620]

[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:48.720]
The boy.

[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:49.860]
The boy.

[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:49.940]

[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:51.860]
The boy.

[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:53.080]
Ah.

[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:54.300]
Ah.

[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:54.560]

[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.360]
1048 cross-been-er-boy about 55-60 bucks

[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.820]
to come to work this morning with a cam.

[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.620]
Now, how many days are you going to be able to keep that up?

[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.580]
About 30, man.

[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:03.980]
Seriously?

[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:08.520]
I didn't have Reynolds Shirt in my old car, but now that I'm

[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.220]
transferring the insurance, I'm getting, uh, that they give me a loan or a rental car.

[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.620]
So hopefully by tomorrow I'll have my rent.

[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.840]
And what about your driver's license?

[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.220]
That shit I've already been taken care of.

[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.640]
Oh, that's right.

[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.140]
Thanks very much to our good friend Randy Maltosha at the ticket defense team.

[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:23.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.320]
Thank God for him, man.

[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:26.140]
He is the best.

[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:29.520]
Anybody out there gets it away to a ticket or any kind of a traffic situation.

[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:30.940]
Ticket defense team.

[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:31.780]
Don't ever forget it.

[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.320]
They're the best.

[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.980]
You're walking through a step by step through everything you need to do.

[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:36.500]
Slap by slip.

[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.240]
47 votes on the pool already.

[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:39.840]
And look at the result.

[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.240]
We have nearly a three-way tie.

[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:45.020]
This is going to be nip and tuck nose to nose, as to ass.

[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.860]
Which of these moves by WQM did you like the most?

[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.120]
Neil goes back to tentative.

[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.840]
Now, I voted for that from strictly selfish purposes.

[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:54.560]
Me too.

[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:54.960]
Would you agree?

[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.060]
That's what I voted for.

[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:56.940]
We loved tentative.

[00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:57.620]
Absolutely.

[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.360]
Yeah.

[00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.080]
Right?

[00:34:59.300 --> 00:34:59.720]
Absolutely.

[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.280]
And the difference is staggering.

[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.380]
I mean, it is palpable.

[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.060]
It's almost palpable as the tension between guilty and moe.

[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:08.520]
Not quite.

[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.000]
Neil goes back to tentative to 14.

[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.820]
Moe gets you back in our 14 and for nuggets he hates to 10 slot 13.

[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.900]
So it's almost a three-way tie.

[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.840]
Almost a triple that he'd so far.

[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.500]
No more crow on a Marlon broadcast for.

[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.960]
Hank loses an hour too and Mad Dog moves to 2 to 4.

[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.040]
Oh, now that Muff is back today.

[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:33.640]
You think maybe we can get a little bit more information since Clarence was impotent yesterday,

[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.480]
which is not unusual.

[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:35.120]
He was limp.

[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.640]
Sends us the X-trend overview report, which again, I don't know if we're supposed to have these or not,

[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.980]
but who the hell cares about the latest trend that came out two days ago?

[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.400]
And which, you know, we didn't do all that great.

[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.480]
It was mediocre on QAM, but nevertheless, RFX,

[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.200]
the other sports station 940 on the dial had a big zero.

[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.060]
Not one diary.

[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.320]
It's just inconceivable to me.

[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.080]
None, zero, nothing.

[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.800]
Zipini Duda.

[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.120]
What a horrible day.

[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.400]
That must be what they're singing over there at the tea channel.

[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.160]
They're sports, baby.

[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.880]
Not a single freaking diary.

[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.200]
And even they got the crow there in the morning now.

[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.260]
Who do you think they would have put him over the top?

[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:14.520]
No.

[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.360]
In fact, maybe that's the reason.

[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.380]
Maybe they could smell the casual mire bouquet coming through their radio speakers

[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.380]
and they couldn't handle it.

[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.160]
They were gagging on it.

[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:23.700]
WRFX.

[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.480]
So I'd sure like to get paid for on there to show us the QAM number, okay?

[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.260]
And the whatever this information is here.

[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.940]
But oh, no, we don't want to do that.

[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.120]
We don't want to give you too much information about how we're doing.

[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:36.540]
We'd rather show you how the guys down the street suck wind as if we didn't already know that.

[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.780]
I'm challenging this audience.

[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.320]
I want to hear it from some caller today who's got a bigger pick-out story

[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.000]
than my eaten seven-clondike bars.

[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.820]
And not just regular pedestrian-clondike bars, but the score-clondike bars.

[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:49.720]
I don't know if you...

[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.900]
I'm sure they must be around.

[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.860]
I'm sure somebody will know some fat...

[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:53.820]
I mean, uh, some personal love.

[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:59.700]
You're talking about some connoisseur of great sweets is what you're talking about.

[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.040]
Talking about that some fat person.

[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.260]
Some connoisseur of great fattening stuff.

[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.040]
Someone who cruises the freezer section like a woman going shopping.

[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:06.660]
Like me.

[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.380]
I like food.

[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:07.740]
Yeah.

[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:13.020]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.300]
It is a disgusting story.

[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.260]
But hey, it certainly isn't the first I've told you.

[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.760]
I've told you about getting a half a gallon of that briar-score ice cream

[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.180]
and putting it into microwave to stop it enough and then eating all around the edges.

[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.500]
And then you have like a little mountain in the middle, like a little hill of ice cream in the middle.

[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.480]
And then you run.

[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.840]
You run to the sink and you put the hot water on your meat like melted and shmit can it.

[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:34.620]
Is what you do.

[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.700]
Lest you eat all of it.

[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:41.020]
Listen, seriously, I can eat a half a gallon of good ice cream without even thinking about it.

[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.440]
Always sitting there watching TV, though.

[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.280]
Don't you have to be watching TV doing these things?

[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:46.660]
It helps.

[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:53.960]
There are some people I don't want to mention any names in the QA Building who have been known to eat on the throne.

[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.860]
I don't want to get too graphic.

[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.880]
To me, that's where I draw the line.

[00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:58.980]
Where did the bathroom door?

[00:37:59.660 --> 00:37:59.840]
Yeah.

[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.040]
Huh?

[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:00.500]
Yeah.

[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:03.220]
I draw the line in the sand with my big toe right there.

[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.980]
Like, no, this is not a place for eating.

[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.040]
Not while you're not while there are role-miss in here.

[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.400]
That's unnatural.

[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.520]
And it's almost like you're trying to replace what's coming out with something else going in.

[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.720]
So you can keep the balance.

[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:15.560]
Yeah.

[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.880]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:17.820]
It's a func sway.

[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:19.560]
Exactly.

[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:21.900]
Oh, God.

[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.900]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.160]
Palm 5, 60 on the 80 and T.

[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.780]
Also, today, I want to hear from some male listener who doesn't like Furell.

[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:36.560]
See, if I just said from a listener who doesn't like him, because he so far has had the most unanimous support, which is great.

[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.760]
Because that to me is a close second.

[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.560]
Be said going back to 10 to 2 is having him as a leading and getting a nice separation from Mo.

[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.900]
So I can see why there's almost a three-way tie there because they all kind of like fit in.

[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.080]
You know, Mo?

[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.140]
They all kind of like fit in together.

[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.680]
All the crap you can unwrap.

[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.360]
All the slime all the time.

[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.680]
They're all interrelated.

[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:54.260]
Absolutely.

[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.560]
Here's a call from North Miami.

[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:56.980]
Hello.

[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:57.700]
Hey, Neil.

[00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:58.080]
How you doing?

[00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:58.800]
Pretty good.

[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.820]
That's like being a real common sewer, isn't it?

[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:01.620]
Yes, always.

[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.180]
Like being in a human sewer.

[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:07.860]
Did you know that they make Yorktown peppermint patties also?

[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:08.960]
I don't like those.

[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:09.660]
I don't like them.

[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:10.180]
I don't like them.

[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.280]
I don't like them.

[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.280]
And they want to make a heat bar?

[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.420]
They want to make a heat bar, yeah.

[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:16.420]
Oh, no.

[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.800]
Why did you come to that?

[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:21.380]
I cruise there.

[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.180]
I only eat as much as that, but I do cruise there.

[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.100]
Now, what's the most you've ever eaten at one sitting ice cream?

[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.380]
Oh, not that much, really.

[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.400]
Maybe half a pint.

[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.400]
I don't know how to tell you that.

[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:32.460]
Please.

[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.100]
I have a pint.

[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.360]
Oh, my God.

[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.380]
I feel so bad that there and I look at my stuff.

[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.880]
I couldn't eat a half a pint before I sat down on the couch.

[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:39.540]
Are you kidding me?

[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.500]
I had a...

[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:47.940]
Did you by any chance there was an article on the paper yesterday about how the governor is going to change the education system in Florida?

[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.000]
He's going to allow high school students to graduate in three years.

[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:52.460]
Great.

[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:53.900]
That'll cut down on me.

[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.820]
I don't see what difference it'll make to get the same education to get in now, basically really.

[00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:58.060]
Right.

[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:03.560]
The other thing I wanted to mention, I got to go, I don't know how you word it, but a great

[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.800]
poll all in here in lately is what a great country we have.

[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:07.620]
Really?

[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.300]
Yeah, I mean people are always saying to me, you know, we're the greatest country in the

[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:11.440]
world.

[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:11.940]
I agree.

[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.060]
I'm in a great country, but I'm not in the US, so.

[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:14.440]
I know.

[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:19.420]
Well, I feel, what I think would be a great poll, if people could explain why the country's

[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:19.640]
great.

[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:27.860]
Maybe it's the health care or the education the kids are getting or maybe it's the, you

[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.760]
know, the fur tax system.

[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.180]
The fur tax system.

[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.040]
I mean, there's so many great things that people should be able to explain it because when

[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.520]
I ask people, they tell me what a great country is, well, what's your criteria?

[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:40.900]
Dead silence.

[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:42.760]
They have nothing to say.

[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.860]
It's just heard it so much.

[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.900]
They just get out their little flag and they wave it a little bit and sing God bless

[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.160]
them out.

[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:48.760]
Yeah, that's it.

[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.420]
And they can't speak anything to them.

[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.860]
Yeah, they do make one other ice cream, which I don't remember, but it has a great

[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.680]
caramel in it, like boozing, you know, have a great day.

[00:40:58.740 --> 00:40:59.560]
Yeah, you too, Neil.

[00:40:59.600 --> 00:40:59.820]
Yeah.

[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.440]
Oh, guys trying to kill me.

[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:02.620]
Try to put me under.

[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.680]
Now, maybe I am the only one.

[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:06.820]
I don't want to feel alone.

[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.560]
I'm sure that I'm not because it believed me.

[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.220]
I'm like Minnie Mouse compared to so many of the other people that I see.

[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.760]
And I've seen a lot of you folks too.

[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.620]
Okay, you're not kidding me.

[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.640]
I've seen some of you people who make me look like, uh, Rumpel Stiltskin on a bad day.

[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.580]
I mean, we're talking huge like that.

[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.500]
Remember the first season in the new arena, the panthers, the macarena?

[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.080]
Nope.

[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:25.900]
Yes.

[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:29.100]
No, you remember me talking about the guy that Kimmel was bitching about those seats

[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:29.540]
in the corner?

[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.340]
How narrow they are.

[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.340]
And he's got a big fat ass.

[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.360]
He couldn't squeeze his ass.

[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.000]
Too bad.

[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.380]
Lose some weight, you fat tub.

[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:35.700]
Okay.

[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:39.840]
And by the way, how about a conduct bar or two or three?

[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.200]
No, thanks.

[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:42.340]
Or six or seven.

[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.020]
I like food.

[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.620]
10, 56 at five, 60, 60, up to QAM.

[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.540]
Hey, I've taken another thing we like in that's hair.

[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.700]
Unfortunately, a lot of us don't have too much life.

[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.000]
All you guys out there, at least most of you,

[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.000]
assume that later that bald spot starts hitting you and then grows and grows

[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.380]
and it gets bigger and bigger.

[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.360]
And before you know what you have nothing but a big bald spot on top of your head.

[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.900]

the most natural looking system in the greatest piece in the world.

[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.840]
It's called the natural hairline system because it looks like it's going out of your scalp.

[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:19.640]
Not like a dead muskrat died on your head or not like some grotesque bunch of holes

[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.100]
were drilled in your head and they put like a couple of follicles in here and there.

[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.540]
If you really want to look better and younger than you have in a long time,

[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.860]
give Charlie a try because his natural hairline system is stupendous.

[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:29.560]
Nobody will know that it's not the real thing.

[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:34.980]
And right now he's offering a summer special hair system for 549 bucks for first time customers only.

[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.300]
If you already have a hair system, you can save you 50% on service and repair

[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.180]
1-800-321-2413.

[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.800]
That's the number to call or check out their website CharlesOffie here.com.

[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:20.000]
I got into an accident in my new car.

[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.540]
I asked the cops just who they're hurting.

[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.280]
I tried to throw my way around but my group failed.

[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.340]
So they threw my peanut boy ass in jail and I got bombed.

[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.200]
They did the peanut boy bombed.

[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:33.780]
That's it?

[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.580]
It is their way of having fun.

[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.720]
Done the peanut boy bombed.

[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.200]
Right, Tom?

[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:47.180]
I like to take my bath in the sink to help keep my chiplets nice and clean.

[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:53.300]
When I tried to apply my baby perfume right here in the sink is where I got screwed.

[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:54.280]
I got bombed.

[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:57.380]
They did the peanut boy bombed.

[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:57.980]
Oh right.

[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.200]
They liked the boy.

[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:01.740]
And they're young.

[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:05.000]
So they did the peanut boy bombed.

[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.020]
Old man more.

[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.440]
He mowed it up to me.

[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.680]
He said, you're the cutest del-boy that I ever didn't see.

[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.140]
I'm going to pop your cherry.

[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.460]
There is nothing you can do.

[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.460]
But you can't pick your boyfriends in the tombs.

[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.640]
Let's bomb them.

[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.620]
They did the peanut boy bombed.

[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:29.620]
By and large they all would come all over the peanut boy that was bombed.

[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.520]
Come here baby.

[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:31.640]
Come here.

[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:32.880]
Come here.

[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:32.940]

[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:33.780]
Come here.

[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:34.880]
Come here.

[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:35.520]
Come here.

[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:36.380]
Come here.

[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:36.800]
Come here.

[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:37.120]
Come here.

[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:37.800]
Come here.

[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:37.800]

[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.380]
Come here.

[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.160]
Come here.

[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:01.180]

[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:01.300]

[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:01.300]

[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:01.300]

[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:01.300]

[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:01.300]

[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:01.360]

[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:01.360]

[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:01.760]
Come here.

[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:01.760]

[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:01.760]

[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:01.860]
Come here.

[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:04.200]
Come here.

[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:04.840]
Come here.

[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:06.040]
Come here.

[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:06.180]
Come here.

[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:06.180]

[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:06.360]
Come here.

We got phoenixs ready.

[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:13.560]

[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:13.560]

[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.640]
We get 5 to 6 hour backs soon.

[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.280]
So did we get that other她 the other

[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:17.860]
Sheets?

[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.340]
Those extraioned sheets you yet?

[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:19.680]
No.

[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.480]
I natuurce and suffer getting cr

[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.000]
up to leave Ky spot.

[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:31.800]
Yes sir?

[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:39.040]
see who's got the busier ass. Here's Miami. Hello. Neil? Yes sir. I don't like

[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:44.560]
Ferrell. Yeah. The H-Morino doesn't like Zach Thomas. He loves the Marlins.

[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:48.920]
And he's trying to get George's job when you're gone. That's thanks. I like George.

[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:54.720]
Ferrell should not buy a house. He ain't gonna last. Okay. Bye. Thanks, Polly. Well

[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:59.220]
there's a guy who doesn't like Scott. I don't know. I guess there have to be a few.

[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:06.700]
I guess one or two or three. How many I think there are? Five six seven oh five

[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:10.280]
sixty pound. We see we won't get any of your stories. Now the guy that called I mean

[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:15.380]
he was a good guy but he can eat a half a pint ice cream. What is that? Nothing.

[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.480]
I can tell. First of all I wish I could eat a half a pint and put the rest of it away.

[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.420]
There is a tritamin chance in hell I could do that ever. When somebody tells me

[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:25.500]
that they ate a half a container of Ben and Jerry's and they put the rest in the

[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:30.140]
freezer I think to myself what kind what are you talking about? Why even waste your

[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:34.320]
time? My appetite isn't even wedded by the time I get to the bottom of the

[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:40.540]
first pint. Which of these moves by WQM did you like the most? We have 135 votes.

[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:46.080]
Neil goes back to 10 to two 56. Ferrell gets the 8 to 10 slot 37.

[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:52.880]
Mo gets shoved back an hour 27. No more crow on a Marlin broadcast 10. Hank loses

[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:56.640]
an hour three and Magdog moves to two to four two because those last two

[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.120]
I just rather insignificant you know just a little bit of a shuffle like the

[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:05.560]
abortion shuffle 5 6 7 0 5 60 one other thing I want to definitely talk about

[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:13.800]
before you let me forget okay and that is this RIA thing. What's that? The

[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.840]
record industry to sue downloads we were talking about it before the show this

[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:21.140]
morning. A lot of people getting into a real panic about this beener boy.

[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:26.580]
The empattled music industry disposed aggressive plans yesterday for an unprecedented

[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:30.320]
escalation in its fight against internet piracy threatening to sue hundreds of

[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:35.120]
individual computer users who illegally share music files online. We're going

[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:40.560]
to line them up and blow their crap away. The Rec recording industry

[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:45.780]
Association of America the RIA setting substantial sales the concept will

[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:50.400]
begin today to search internet file sharing that works to identify users who

[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:55.520]
offer substantial collections of MP3 music files for downloading it expects to

[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.620]
file at least several hundred lawsuit seeking financial damages within eight to

[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:03.140]
10 weeks. Executives for the RIA the Washington based lobbying group that

[00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:06.780]
represents major labels wouldn't say how many songs any users computer would

[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:10.780]
qualify for a lawsuit the new campaign comes just weeks after US appeals

[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:13.740]
court rulings requiring internet providers to identify subscriber

[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:18.180]
suspect of illegally sharing music and movie files. The RIA is present and

[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:21.440]
Carrie Sherman said tens of millions of internet users of popular file sharing

[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:25.240]
software after today will expose themselves to the real risk of having to face

[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:29.760]
the music. It's stealing it's both wrong and illegal Sherman said alluding to

[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.600]
the court decision Sherman said internet users who believe they can hide behind

[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.980]
an alien's online were mistaken you are not anonymous he said we're going to

[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:41.180]
begin taking names. Critics accused the RIA of

[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:44.300]
reserting to heavy handed tactics like likely to alienate millions of internet

[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.720]
file shares this latest effort really indicates the recording industry has

[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:50.940]
lost touch with reality completely said Fred Vod Loman a lawyer for the

[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.880]
Electronic Frontier Foundation does anyone take more lawsuits are going to be

[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:59.220]
the answer today they declared war on the American consumer. Sherman disputed

[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:02.080]
that consumers who are gradually turning to legitimate websites to buy

[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:05.460]
music legally will object to the industry's latest efforts against pirates you

[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:08.400]
have to look at exactly who are your customers he added you could say the

[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.800]
same thing about shoplift here's are you worried about alienating them all sorts

[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.680]
of industries retailers have come to the conclusion that they need to be able to

[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:19.100]
protect their rights we've come to the same conclusion Mike Goodwin Godwin a

[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.660]
public knowledge a consumer group that challenged broad crackdowns on

[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:24.400]
file sharing that was said yesterday's announcement was appropriate because

[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:28.760]
it targeted users illegally sharing copyrighted files I'm sure it's going to

[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.860]
freak them out Godwin said the free right is over he added I wouldn't be

[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:35.200]
surprised if at least some people engaged in file trading decided resist and

[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:40.760]
tried to find ways to fork litigation strategy no Schmidt Mike so what do you

[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:46.860]
think see I don't understand how are they going to find out I'm reading this but

[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:50.080]
how do they find out who's not even who's nice how do they do they have days

[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:53.840]
who they have ways well that's a little bit chillin ain't it it is chill especially

[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.160]
if you're chillin are spending a lot of time on your computer and you know what

[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.640]
the hell you're doing this is another one of your psychic things because just

[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:07.060]
yesterday based on other issues I told my child to uninstall Kazan all other

[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:15.880]
associated things like good good move when it doubt yank it out 5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:20.820]
pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line I'd sure like to find out how

[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.440]
the hell they do that because it sounds like they're like tap right into your

[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:28.400]
computer right well depending on which file sharing service you're using

[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.120]
yeah I'm giving you the ability to see exactly what the individual has out

[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.660]
there in other words when you find somebody that has a file that you want you

[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:38.960]
can also look at their other files so you get an idea of what their collection

[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:45.500]
or selection is going yeah here's a call from plantation hello yeah and you

[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:50.540]

[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:20.680]
I'll see it online a crispy cream okay they had the opening of a new one in

[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.420]
Boston I was just reading at this morning see there's your psychic powers

[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:27.740]
again inspired the sky and they said it was the biggest opening they ever had

[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:31.000]
another one here outside of Toronto that they was it last year must have been

[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:35.700]
they had a just gigantic remember how many I forget how many like a million

[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:39.860]
donuts or some unbelievable total but the one in Boston they said was the

[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:44.160]
biggest one they ever had crispy cream you can't eat only a three dozen right now

[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:50.640]
there yes we we might have a contest there's so the crispy creams are so light

[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:54.980]
and fluffy and yummy no they're not they're well they're light in the way but

[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:58.280]
in terms of richness man they're sweet there that's why it's like an injection

[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.380]
into your veins is that I think in a pure sugar injection right into your

[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:06.340]
your vein I could eat a dozen of those easy a dozen yeah I couldn't do not know

[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:10.980]

and we'll bring in like a gallon of Ben and Jerry's fish food we can now a gallon

[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:24.080]
a gallon would be how many points there's two points in a quart okay we should do

[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:31.580]
my weight there's two points in a quart right okay so that's and then there's

[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:37.400]
four quarts in a gallon so that's eight points that would that would be eight

[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:42.360]
points I got to handle that well that's here's like as four points would be

[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.580]
half again I take that back four points would be half-gown that'd be my limit

[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:51.800]

[00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:01.520]
I mean I know a picture mean it voice something to cheer with his shades on

[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:05.440]
you're looking at what I'm looking at what do you mean by that this is a first

[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:09.680]
for me no no no no this is a still this is not it's not a live picture this is

[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.240]
from like whenever you might as well be

[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:16.360]
was in a way he still he still slept over the chair

[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:20.880]
no no Hank fell asleep during his own show was he's falling asleep not fall in

[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:25.080]
not falling rather he's asleep he's asleep

[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:33.900]
alright and yes of course I sent a copy to Eric so it's right it's already on

[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:36.600]
the website right there front and center for the y'all it's a beautiful thing

[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:42.580]
audience can see being a boy sound asleep really hard at work doing what he does best

[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.660]
this is a this is a first I mean I'm in the first I think

[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:54.640]
before but it was a high school basketball game how embarrassing now what what are we going to do

[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:58.520]
about I don't know I was hoping that we could work out something like any special reason

[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:02.340]
for this I mean he did not know what he was supposed to be putting those bedtime stories on

[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:09.640]
here which we had like 17 of the day he's taken a nap he's losing his I looked up I was going to say something

[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:14.000]
and I noticed that he was out so I had not gone well this show has been on to do that

[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.920]
yeah plus we're talking about food you know I like food yeah right he's not into it so I thought we

[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:27.400]
could figure out an imaginative clever way of waking him up or or not how about if

[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.820]
clearance comes in and taxes back to about that I mean clearance admitted to me the other

[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.260]
yesterday he's desperate he'll take anything he might sleep through that

[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:40.880]
I was first asked that jail experience might be old news 198 votes on a pool which of these moves by

[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:46.080]
QM did you like the most Neil goes back to 10 to 2 80 oh we're pulling away

[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:52.120]
vulgar chub back in our 47 for out against the 8 to 10 slot 44 no more crow on

[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:59.060]
those Marlon games 15 Hank loses in our 8 and the mad dog moves to 2 to 4 4 so it's basically

[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:06.060]
a three we all a crow is doing a bit of an I thought he would 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60

[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:11.560]
on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line uh Vina Boisersley he's taking a nap he's under a lot of

[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:16.920]
stress did he get his time sheet at least he has he did there you go well I guess that's probably

[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.800]
what put him over the edge when clearance told him he had five minutes to get his time sheet

[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:24.940]
and he wasn't going to pay it on the 10th I think that just stressed him out max all these

[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:28.880]
people are in a big important meeting of some sort that's why we're not going to be able to get those

[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:34.880]
numbers anytime soon a big important meeting right maybe it's a meeting about what we're going to be doing

[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:39.860]
on starting next week that could be on like Monday Wednesday and Friday maybe

[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:43.880]
that's a for all kind of a meeting where we actually get an answer to our question but why do

[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.760]
we want to decide now when we have like at least a full week to do it sure here's Miami

[01:01:47.760 --> 01:02:03.960]
hello Miami he's gone oh he's there's somebody there hello hola and back to you have a

[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:09.860]
nice life here is a call from coral springs hello hey Neil one time first time yes sir

[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:14.900]
um I'm an attorney I represent a bunch of people being sued by direct DV I heard you're talking about

[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:19.860]
being sued by the recording industry associate America some believable if people don't

[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:23.560]
think that they can really be sued by these big companies they can I represent about a half a

[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:29.620]
dozen people right now and what the recording industry is going to do is they're going to get your IP

[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:34.560]
address when you download files off a causa they'll go to your internet service provider say

[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:38.520]
who was logged on at that time and that's it they've got you now they still got a proof

[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:43.620]
who was sitting behind the computer right but at least they they now have your address and who

[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:47.580]
will who needs that kind of problem also in other words they have to prove who's at the

[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:51.140]
computer though some of it just because the computer might be in your name for example or

[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:55.620]
like to use me as an example in my name if somebody else is at my computer and is sharing

[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.000]
files I'm not responsible for that it's a good defense but again you're going to have the

[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.640]
cost of litigation oh so I'm going to put my computer in the bottom of the pool when I get

[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:12.940]
back I think so it's the safest thing to do yeah anyway I like to tend to two thanks palying all

[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:16.480]
right see you okay so there's some good news for you now be able I'm sure he's going to give us

[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:24.820]
some information about that is he still asleep yeah get out of here are you sure he's alive

[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:29.840]
no I'm going to go poke him with this I would hate to think that he was going to die in the

[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:34.840]
middle of the show you know I'm saying those might have been his last words right after he said I like food

[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:40.780]
that's all my yeah yeah maybe my client like bars three put him over the edge under the edge

[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:46.040]
go in the other room and tap him all right on the shoulder very likely because he's

[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.820]
slumped over he's got a shave don't want to be on the shoulder lightly I want to kick the chair

[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:54.620]
so he falls out of it okay kick the chair and jump up like I don't know what you know what you're

[01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:08.260]
going to do here we go yeah I'm in the other room I'm in the other room okay I'm over here

[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:11.960]
I'm going to turn the microphone up really not so we can hear what happens okay I'm going

[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:19.680]
to tap your chair over so he falls on the ground okay no I'm going to swim with a chair

[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:34.780]
he's going to fall wake up wake up he's not dead well I'm sure he's not dead all right

[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:40.400]
peanut boy still alive he survived two days with a higher layer cups with a broom handles

[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:49.760]
and all he's still alive that's shocking what was the reaction movement slow it first slow

[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:56.120]
and this sounds like a drug addition to me five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty

[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.440]
and you know this I had the one guy with a donut thing but there's nobody going to

[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:08.400]
in denial they will not admit that they're pigs that they do these things that they binge like

[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.640]
I do they want to leave me hanging out there in the lim oh that Neil he's a real pig can you believe

[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:27.260]
and

[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:27.260]

[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:27.520]
and

[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:27.540]
and

[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:27.560]
and

[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:45.420]
of

[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:48.100]
What does that mean? Why do I like it so much because it's a real city?

[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:54.960]
Oh, because I'm from there originally and yeah, you know people got a chip on their shoulder. No, they don't

[01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:59.860]
People there have a chip under shoulder and soft thought. I don't I don't meet anybody who would a chip under shoulder

[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:05.820]
People are friendly their polite. It's a great place a real city. What was I like? No, it is

[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:08.380]
It's a very close-up city and it's a world-class

[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:12.120]
Then why would you say people have a chip on you should just got through saying they have a chip under shoulder

[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:14.120]
Why would they see it about about Americans?

[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:20.440]
You know when I one of my relatives go come down here I go up there. It's like God how can you live in America?

[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.260]
Is this that that I'm like yeah?

[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.200]
There's only 30 million people in the country

[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:28.380]
But see I don't I don't talk to people about America when I go to a restaurant

[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:31.420]
They say are you American? I mean just a guy, you know, I mean

[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:34.040]
That's another way thing is that people here seem to get along

[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.220]
You know you got people from all different parts of the world everybody seems to get along

[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:41.820]
Well, yeah, that's what I'm saying because when I go up there it's like all they talk about America

[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:47.540]
They know more about America than about Canada. I haven't had anybody talk to me here about America now one person

[01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:51.000]
I've been here almost two years on and off and I've never had anybody talk to me about America

[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:56.080]
Really? Well, how come this so fascinating up there about the US everything for you

[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.700]
After you have they love coming down here

[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:01.680]
Well, because they're in a pended of the US what do you expect because we made them look into a stepchild

[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:05.940]
The only difference being that it's a hell of a lot more progressive and they're like moving forward rapidly here

[01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:09.280]
And making great strides while the US is taking giant steps backward with bush

[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:13.120]
How do they make it? How do they think progressive and have a great day sir

[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:17.900]
If I have to if I have to draw a road map for you know, no wonder they kicked his ass out of here

[01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:20.200]
Okay, probably the custom said hey don't come back

[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:25.280]
Fine like this guy's gonna argue with me if you don't like it here. Don't come back pal

[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:30.720]
If you like it in the States great if I have to display the other difference between progress between living in an enlightened country

[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:34.720]
And living in a repressive stone age country. Hey, it's hopeless

[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:37.100]
I'm glad you're happy and I am too

[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:39.680]
And I'm especially happy that you're not here no mo

[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:41.640]
5 6 7 0 5

[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:47.120]
Welcome. You don't like Amsterdam anymore. How come you like Toronto? How come you like fish food? How come you like them?

[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:50.760]
Climb like score bars. How do I do because I feel like it? I do like that

[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.020]
Like I'll just got an explanation

[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:59.100]
Here's Miami. Hello. Yeah, well, I'll explain it a little bit to him. Why the hell shouldn't Toronto?

[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:03.200]
And be proud of the wonderful city like Toronto right and you know, so yeah

[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:07.960]
Toronto and you know a lot Canadians in general know a lot about the world in general

[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:12.120]
Unlike Americans who are very parochial and never been anywhere right exactly

[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:16.960]
That idiot belongs here in Miami. Yes, he found he found his level

[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.780]
I mean my goodness that good I call this blew me away. I forgot what the hell I was gonna call you about

[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:24.900]
Serious that was like ridiculous

[01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:30.860]
They don't have a chip Toronto. You don't have a chip on there. I'm gonna tell you something the one knock on the people here over

[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:35.900]
The years has been the people are too polite if there's such a thing. I don't after limited South Florida for so many years

[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.660]
I don't think there's any such thing as too polite

[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:43.420]
It's a pleasure to find people that are friendly that hold the door open. It's a good morning. I have no problem with that

[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:47.920]
I've never met a Canadian who would keep the change if they were given too much change back

[01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:52.300]
You know, uh, I could I could mention one but I don't want to mention his name on you

[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:59.320]
That's true anyway, I just wanted to make a little comment about Carlos who I really do like and I know you

[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:04.540]
I like him too a lot, but he's he's he's I have a feeling that he's spinning out of control and his

[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:05.140]
his

[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:09.840]
Supervisor their George is just sitting by and enjoying an amusement watching it happen

[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:16.420]
Well, uh, you know, uh, the thing is that I know you're an excellent person to work for and I know that George is extremely loyal to you

[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:23.940]
Has never a bad word to say about you when you're away and that is extremely loyal and uh, and behold and see that's how what Carl is told me

[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:24.700]
Well

[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:28.720]
So you should have heard the crap off the year. No, not on the year. He's not gonna sick

[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:33.620]
I might be monitoring. I got a pot here. I can pot him up anytime. Man, please now. He's okay. George is all right

[01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:36.220]
He's got his uh, but then don't we all have a great day, pali

[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:37.680]
See you around a

[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:44.260]
Yes, he's picking on through as if we haven't had enough being people picking on us already here with his SARS in the mad cow

[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:49.780]
In the west now virus and now we got that big concert July 30th the free concert for only 2150

[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:56.060]
But it's going to it's going to a good cause going to uh, charity the nurses that worked overtime during the SARS thing

[01:27:56.060 --> 01:28:00.580]
It's gonna be good. The stones are gonna be here and the AC DC and a whole bunch of people

[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:04.780]
But just to prove that nothing is perfect Justin Tinkerbell be here too

[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:13.180]
I

[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:18.500]
This mark Morgan is the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M

[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:24.820]
Let me tell you a little bit about the wheels that I drive to work in

[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:30.560]
Now I'm not trying to be rude, but you can really get screwed by those dealers trying to sell you

[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:35.640]
Automobiles brand new see I don't need the fancy grills all those new cops man

[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:40.200]
I've had my baby 20 years shitting on those stripped out years to the hongo

[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:42.860]
And the hongo

[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:48.340]
Got a four on the floor it got all four of its doors, but not a hell of a lot more

[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:51.820]
It needs a brand new ignition. It got a broken transmission

[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:57.300]
It got some holes in the body got front and rear fenders missing leaks like to son of a gun

[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:02.880]
I'm like so what it runs it's a piece of you know what did you but at least it's made for aha

[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.300]
It's a trouble one at five 60 it's our gigantic world famous new into one hour

[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:12.720]
Thank God for being back 10 to two. It's all I can say and I'm looking at these numbers. Do they send this to make directed to you facts?

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:16.020]
I thought the law fact the X trends

[01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:22.680]
Not a pretty picture. I'll tell you that of course these are 12 plus they mean absolutely nothing

[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:29.480]
It's impressive. I got like just zidians the numbers here all kinds of stations AMFM mobile X-on chevron

[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.840]
You name it we got it

[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:35.380]
But it's not a pretty picture this 12 plus is it nope

[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:42.260]
Morning in the last month in May 2.1 mid days 3.1

[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:43.980]
Afternoons are two two

[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:48.300]
Night times a 1.1 and on a weekend a 1.0

[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:51.160]
That's 12 plus which which means nothing

[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:55.780]
Why are we wasting our time with this? I guess we can't get the other demos in this X trends right?

[01:29:55.900 --> 01:30:03.480]
I guess or is it just that they're saying this to impress me again at our effects at Fox Sports has a big

[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:06.060]
In a month of May and they want to like emphasize that against

[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:10.440]
Which that one does mean something because that's the entire audience 12 plus I mean

[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.240]
There's no hope of them finding where like in men

[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.180]
We did good. They just had no diaries nobody

[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:18.980]
They got got young people they got old people. They don't have men. They don't have women. They don't have children

[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:23.240]
They don't have dead people. They don't have senior citizens. They don't have anybody because they have a zero

[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:33.080]
That is remarkable and yeah, it's amazing. It's amazing. Is he working on those bedtime stories? I want to report minute by minute

[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:34.460]
I want to know what else going on there

[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:40.120]
These pictures of him leaning over past that it was amusing the first time but now you know

[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:45.020]
Why do we want to hey clearance? Why do we want to pay somebody to come in and sleep? You know they QM hotel

[01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:49.820]
Just why not give him a pillow pillow in a sheet works for everybody else

[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:51.120]
Yeah

[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:58.160]
Man oh man, what a hot shot all of a sudden he gets a couple of paychecks right off the bed he thinks he's coming in just a

[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:01.980]
snoozing and cruising and schmoozing and smoking and joking and

[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:10.660]
Token here's a shaman hollywood who says I hardly concur with your listener recommended the name of the rose

[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:18.640]
Sean Connery plays a monk who's kind of an ecclesiastical Sherlock Holmes investigating the brutal murders of younger monks in a remote 15th century monastery

[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:22.140]
Not to be missed our Ron Proman is the heretical demanded hunchback

[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:24.900]
This is quite a review man not to be missed

[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:31.960]
Who speaks English Italian French and Portuguese the all in the same sentence and even Christian Slater can't ruin the sex scene between the

[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:38.960]
Virginal Young monk Ujul and a filthy but beautiful play a peasant girl the scene is so horny that you wish you were straight if only for a moment

[01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:46.800]
Well, why is that I cannot look at Christian Slater if you must he's out of study he wasn't there at our olders this movie

[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:52.960]
Old oh well in that case he was like young and hung he wasn't that ugly. He was just annoying right certainly wasn't ugly

[01:31:52.960 --> 01:32:00.640]
He was pretty okay. I'd watch so there you go. That's the latest negators from Sean and hollywood is chronic but okay five six seven oh five sixty

[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:06.900]
We had one guy we had one I and of course what I asked for we never get anyway, you know, it's just frost my ass

[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.380]
That's the one thing that's the one boat of contention

[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:16.660]
That I'll never ever give up on is the fact that these bastards just will not play the game man no matter what it is that I'm asking

[01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:22.900]
They don't I had asked for a male males out there don't like for well and the reason I did this because I didn't think they're beat now

[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:26.220]
Maybe that one guy maybe he's the only one maybe that's possible

[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:32.660]
Because I think that he's gone over bigger than god damn Mary Tyler more if you ask me I could be wrong about that

[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:34.640]
I could be totally full of crap. I don't think so

[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:39.040]
And we won't find out till the end of July when a June month kicks in there

[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:43.420]
Also instead of coming in the old Amath will be very nice

[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:45.980]
I realize that you'd like to give us that medical report every morning

[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:50.080]
But during that period of time that we have to bond in the morning, which is so such valuable

[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:54.460]
Short period of time will be a hell of a lot nicer if you'd like tell me what else going on

[01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:58.940]
Wouldn't that be better if we had like a little business talk instead of dust daily medical report?

[01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:01.740]
Ah, whatever if there's anybody on swathe here about dust

[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:04.640]
them we'll give them your home phone number. He can call you up and tell you

[01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:09.480]
Look for the QM van right now from now to one o'clock at Austin's dive shop in Miami

[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:14.900]
105 25 South Dixie highway. I bet you Miguel is sitting there just dying to see you stop

[01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:18.600]
I'd get some free Marlon tickets courtesy of the mere little pages from Bell Sound

[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.120]
Somebody's got to go

[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:23.020]
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:24.560]
Yeah, good news

[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:29.960]
The Supreme Court throughout the Sodom, I mean, law in Texas. How come I'm not watching the CNN right now

[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:32.800]
It's on loving it love. It's on aol the

[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:36.540]
No, there it is right now. There's a watch his name Bob Frank and it just turned 100

[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:41.500]
That's finally some good news. Who's expected? But isn't that a shock?

[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:46.620]
Yeah, I gotta I can't imagine which three were in the minority the three who fascist over there

[01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:52.040]
Scalia rank quest and the clearance of token Thomas probably right the three get the three guise or whatever right

[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:58.660]
But now is the question Neil the Supreme Court hang on the right privacy in the home

[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:06.220]
Would it affirm or overturn its own 1986 ruling which upheld the Georgia law banning Sodom all together

[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:14.040]
Or with the justices limit their new decision to the Texas statute that only banned Sodom between homosexuals

[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:20.040]
In 1998 to Houston men were arrested briefly jailed and fined $200

[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:24.780]
When they were caught in a sexual act by polícia who crashed into their bedroom

[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:28.720]
Investigating what turned out to be a false burglary report

[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:29.940]
Stop oh

[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:35.060]
Stoppose the word go ahead sir. I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. You can listen to that. I just uh

[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:37.100]
I wonder now if we could go go go go go

[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:42.060]
You say

[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:45.820]
What did he say burger rate boom. I'm a little bum bum. Oh something about that

[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:48.280]
I don't want to hear no more than that.

[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:49.880]
So how do you like that?

[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:51.380]
The Supreme Court said it's...

[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:52.660]
That's why the Texas Law...

[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:54.660]
The Public Health, the Public Memorial says...

[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:55.880]
Oh, the Family Research Council.

[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:58.260]
There's another one of those crazy right-wing religious nuts.

[01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:00.240]
With this homophobic bullcrap.

[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:02.740]
Oh, there's Rick Santorum.

[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:04.020]
I'm sure he's like Fulman at the Mount.

[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.960]
He's probably bending down on all fours right now.

[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:06.880]
Here is the story.

[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.120]
Let me print it out.

[01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:09.020]
When did that print it out?

[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:09.280]

[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.420]
Oh, this computer is driving me nuts.

[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:18.220]
So the guy that called before who allegedly was from Toronto,

[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:19.480]
but has loved it down there now.

[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.260]
Here's another classic example for here.

[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:22.240]
It's 2003.

[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:25.460]
And they're finally, the Supreme Court had the balls finally,

[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:28.060]
to strike down these archaic Sodomy laws, okay?

[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:31.880]
Well, we got gays flocking here from all over the world

[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:32.840]
to get married now.

[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:34.820]
And while they're decriminalizing Marigewini,

[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:37.480]
and I've put in people in jail for a couple of pin joints,

[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:39.780]
how are they making strides?

[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:42.460]
So you're living in a stone age, man, and believe me,

[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:44.440]
like the other guy said, you found your right level.

[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:45.980]
Softloader perfect for you.

[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:50.280]
Just look at Benavoy there.

[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:53.740]
It's slammed into the goddamn slimmer just because he happened to be.

[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:54.840]
Drive one out of license.

[01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:56.820]
Hit somebody in the middle of the street.

[01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:58.400]
Was on the wrong side of the road.

[01:35:59.580 --> 01:35:59.940]
Drunk.

[01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:01.460]
Stone out of his mind.

[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:04.340]
I mean, you know, what kind of excuse is that to put somebody in jail?

[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:04.820]
Right?

[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:06.000]
Here's the story.

[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.160]
Supreme Court's right now.

[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:07.860]
Oh, you're awake now?

[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:07.900]
How's it going?

[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:08.840]
How are you doing?

[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:10.920]
I don't know.

[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:11.840]
I guess not too good.

[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:12.440]
From what?

[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:13.300]
From what?

[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:15.900]
We're going to have to get him a new computer.

[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:16.820]
How much of that thing cost?

[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:18.200]
Those are expensive those laptops.

[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:18.900]
Yeah.

[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:19.440]
I know.

[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.000]
I'm doing all of it.

[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:20.040]
I'm doing it.

[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:21.320]
I'm doing it.

[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:21.680]
I'm doing it.

[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:23.500]
That's a lot nicer than mine.

[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:25.260]
I'm a lot less than I did.

[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:26.060]
Yeah, but I see.

[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:27.920]
I don't know whether we should get you one,

[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.900]
because you, everything you touch fries anyway.

[01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:30.860]
That's a good point.

[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:31.280]
Like his brain.

[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:31.500]
Yeah.

[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:34.400]
You can give him a brand new one out of the box,

[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:35.660]
and buy you a six o'clock tonight.

[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:36.160]
You can't do that.

[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:37.420]
Oh, dude, the damn thing blew up.

[01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:39.240]
How does your computer blow up?

[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.300]
How does that happen when you stuff it with firecrackers,

[01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:43.480]
and then like the fuse?

[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:45.040]
It works like a charm every time.

[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:46.040]
That's what Harry said.

[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:48.280]
How's Mary and do anything?

[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:49.160]
Mary's coming back.

[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:50.240]
Come on, Mary.

[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:51.580]
And come on down to North Carolina.

[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:52.740]
See how Harry's doing.

[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:57.600]
The Supreme Court struck down a Texas ban on gay sex today.

[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:00.660]
Knowing that the law was an unconstitutional violation of

[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:02.980]
the Justice's vote at six to three,

[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:05.800]
and striking down the Texas Law saying

[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:07.560]
it violated due process guarantees.

[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:11.280]
The petitioners are in total respect for their private lives,

[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:13.560]
just as Anthony Kennedy wrote for the Court's majority,

[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:15.940]
the states cannot demean their existence

[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:18.480]
or control their destiny by making their private sexual

[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:19.560]
contact a crime.

[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:19.880]
Oh!

[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:23.160]
Gay rights advocates immediately hail to decision-making

[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.600]
by religious conservatives, of course,

[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:26.740]
bigoted assholes, right-wing,

[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:29.420]
Bible thumping, hate mongers, it's a condended.

[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.320]
It's an historic day for gay Americans

[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.860]
said Ruth Harlow of the Land Illegal Defense Education Fund

[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:37.060]
and Gay Rights Group representing the two Texas men.

[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:39.460]
I think Americans will be celebratory about this decision

[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:40.740]
or maybe celibate.

[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:43.840]
The ruling reverses an 86-high court ruling

[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.340]
up holding state anti-saturday laws.

[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:47.240]
Kennedy wrote that homosexuals have the full right

[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.780]
to engage in their conduct without intervention to government.

[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:50.940]
You go, boy.

[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:54.200]
The case stand, mom, we know about that.

[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.820]
Gay rights advocates argued the law, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

[01:37:57.140 --> 01:37:59.520]
a very strong ruling that we all as individuals,

[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:01.620]
whether gay or straight had liberty to choose

[01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:02.780]
who will love and how we'll do that

[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:04.580]
in the privacy of our own homes, Harlow said.

[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:09.040]
The Court is just catching up with American society,

[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.840]
which has already recognized gay peoples'

[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:12.080]
equal liberty, equal humanity,

[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.100]
and the Court issued a very powerful decision

[01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:15.300]
that's self-organizing that humanity.

[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:17.860]
In addition to what she left out is that all Americans,

[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:19.800]
at least anybody with a brain, don't want the God-dem

[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:20.760]
government in their bedroom.

[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:25.080]
But the ruling immediately drew fire from a spokesman

[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:27.940]
for a religious conservative group, the National Clergy Council.

[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:30.380]
The Court has said today that morality matters

[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:31.380]
of right and wrong behavior.

[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:32.500]
Do not matter in the law.

[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:34.320]
Said the Reverend Rob Schneck, Shank,

[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:35.680]
one of the group's founders.

[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:38.780]
It's an undermining of our concept of justice in this country, said.

[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:42.160]
The Texas case already is entered the National Public

[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:45.200]
Obaid Steered by May Comments from Senator Rick Santura.

[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:46.720]
Remember these sentence Republican leadership?

[01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:49.520]
Santura said if the justice is overturned the Texas law,

[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:51.600]
then you have the right to beg of me, you have the right to

[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:53.800]
plig of me, you have the right to incest, you have the right to

[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:55.580]
adultery, you have the right to anything in his case,

[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.720]
you even have the right to be an asshole.

[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:03.920]
Okay, here are the people who voted in favor of this decision.

[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:04.420]
Okay?

[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:06.760]
Striking down that Sodomy law.

[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:09.500]
Justice John Paul Stevens, David Souter,

[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:12.480]
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer, and of course, Kennedy.

[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:16.080]
Justice San Rodeo Conner agreed with the outcome of the case,

[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:17.600]
but not all of Kennedy's rationale.

[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:22.500]
And what did I just say to this last caller?

[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:25.900]
He said who do you think the three were who voted against it?

[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:28.300]
Chief Justice William Rincquist,

[01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:33.220]
Justice's Anthony Nscalia and Clarence Thomas descended.

[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:38.520]
Scalia said the court is largely signed under the so-called homosexual agenda.

[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:43.180]
He also took the unusual step of reading his descent from the bench.

[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.540]
The court has taken sides in the culture war,

[01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:48.700]
Scalia said, adding that he has nothing against homosexuals.

[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:50.560]
Oh, great!

[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:54.700]
Oh, my God, Anthony Nscalia.

[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:58.820]
Do you understand the stupeo keeps track of everyone?

[01:39:59.160 --> 01:39:59.840]
Yeah, we understand.

[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:01.840]
Not see bastard.

[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.660]
Remember that scene in the exorcist?

[01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:06.340]
Yes.

[01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:07.300]
I'm sure you do.

[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:08.300]
Don't we all?

[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:09.280]
Don't we all remember?

[01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:12.460]
Hans, wasn't that his name Hans?

[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:12.960]
C.

[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:16.140]
12 minutes passed known as 560 WQM.

[01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:16.920]
So how do you like that?

[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.800]
This week all sorts of stuff is going on.

[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:22.820]
And the bushes in the right wing supporters like it in a little slap on the ass, aren't they?

[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:23.220]
Correct them!

[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.560]
Yeah, slapped around a little bit.

[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:25.120]
But good.

[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:28.620]
Spotted the three self-appointed Nazis that they got on.

[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:30.460]
Well, they didn't put them in, but they loved them.

[01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:31.780]
In fact, well, no, they put him in.

[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:33.100]
Yeah.

[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:33.820]
They put him in there.

[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:37.040]
I was thinking about that yesterday about that day, that last day of the county.

[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:39.960]
Remember when they were counting the votes again after the Florida Supreme Court said,

[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:41.760]
uh, start the vote, count the vote.

[01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:44.920]
And they said, stop the vote.

[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:47.860]
As soon as it started, that margins started to get really raised.

[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:49.780]
Or they cut it out, stop voting now.

[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:51.560]
The real winner might win.

[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.200]
And look what we got now.

[01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:56.680]
Look what we got now.

[01:40:57.620 --> 01:40:59.660]
They stored right there in broad daylight.

[01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:01.580]
All those lunatics, let us in!

[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:02.260]
Let us in!

[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:03.160]
Right there in Dave County.

[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:04.680]
Okay, people ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:05.780]
And happen right there as usual.

[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:06.980]
All the crap all the time.

[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:08.500]
All the crap you can unwrap.

[01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:10.280]
All the slime all the time.

[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:10.940]
You got them, O.

[01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:12.460]
That's South Florida.

[01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:16.000]
Home of one embarrassing episode after the other.

[01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:18.980]
12-13 at 5.

[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:20.880]
I can little worked out a little bit.

[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:23.180]
But thanks anyway, that caller for giving me the heads up on it,

[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:24.920]
because I was, uh, I was not watching CNN.

[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:26.540]
I tried to avoid it as much as possible.

[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:28.480]
By now you've been here at about Lamin and Saras.

[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:28.900]
I'm sure.

[01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:32.400]
And about how Lamin and Wood flooring from Lamin and Saras is the easy, the intelligent,

[01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:35.420]
the inexpensive, low maintenance alternative to natural wood flooring.

They've got all the top names all installed by Pergo certified installers.

[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:48.440]
Here's another reason why you should call Lamin and Saras.

[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:50.640]
Their prices will absolutely floier.

Just $1995 for up to 380 square feet of beautiful Lamin and Wood flooring.

[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:02.420]
It is positively un-believeable.

Giving big, big pleasure in a big, big way.

[01:42:57.770 --> 01:42:59.890]
The very best of baggots in the USA.

[01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:03.390]
Giving big, big pleasure in a big, big way.

[01:43:04.350 --> 01:43:05.690]
Just her feet.

[01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:09.210]
Join the big swish to Chesterfield Queen.

[01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:11.270]
You choice of the Fags of America.

[01:43:11.490 --> 01:43:12.190]
Okay, 208.

[01:43:12.250 --> 01:43:14.010]
A big day for Fags all over America.

[01:43:14.110 --> 01:43:18.350]
And of course here in Canada we've had big days for weeks now and beyond that.

[01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:20.730]
And anyway, I just got your latest picture.

[01:43:21.210 --> 01:43:24.270]
A very, very sad commentary on what's going on in that studio there.

[01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:25.950]
It's scandalous.

[01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.830]
Yeah.

[01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:32.450]
Did you get the other story that I just passed you, Boeiner Boy?

[01:43:32.670 --> 01:43:35.470]
The one to add about the Supreme Court's record on the Texas Sotamin Law.

[01:43:35.530 --> 01:43:37.290]
And I said, be sure and add this on our Stone Art Beener.

[01:43:37.930 --> 01:43:38.530]
Yes, you did.

[01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:39.130]
Good.

[01:43:39.690 --> 01:43:41.290]
Was he just making guttable sounds?

[01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:42.810]
No, he's up and running around.

[01:43:43.190 --> 01:43:43.890]
Up and running around.

[01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.510]
Let's hear it.

[01:43:44.670 --> 01:43:46.030]
Boeiner Boy is up and running around.

[01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:48.630]
Okay, a lot of people out there in the audience were very concerned for him.

[01:43:48.710 --> 01:43:50.930]
They thought maybe he was on a way out to an early demise.

[01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:54.350]
Probably because George gave him some really tainted bed crap.

[01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:55.270]
Which wasn't surprising.

[01:43:55.410 --> 01:43:56.410]
Don't hang that on me.

[01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:57.550]
I bet you could have.

[01:43:58.610 --> 01:44:00.430]
You've been known to do this before, okay?

[01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:02.330]
He was starting to get a little bit too big for his brishes.

[01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:03.550]
Starting to like expand.

[01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:04.290]
He was a risin'.

[01:44:04.290 --> 01:44:05.310]
He was after your job.

[01:44:05.890 --> 01:44:09.130]
And right off the bed he comes in this morning and you like slip my little something.

[01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:10.990]
And I know that's what he was outside smoking.

[01:44:11.150 --> 01:44:11.770]
You're not foolin' me.

[01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:12.890]
Okay, yeah.

[01:44:13.170 --> 01:44:15.410]
How many times did I ask you this morning?

[01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:16.430]
Where is that man?

[01:44:16.450 --> 01:44:17.290]
About third man.

[01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:19.350]
And you were like, my meat, my boot, but about your monkey best friend.

[01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:20.990]
I don't know about a beep, but a boot.

[01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:24.050]
Said he's out there looking most, asked or something or cleaning his pee bag.

[01:44:24.170 --> 01:44:25.150]
I don't know what you were talking about.

[01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:28.230]
George tried that, look at like cab driver to go over to my house.

[01:44:28.370 --> 01:44:28.530]
Right.

[01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:30.290]
I set that cab to a Danny.

[01:44:30.770 --> 01:44:31.470]
That's what it was.

[01:44:31.690 --> 01:44:32.630]
That packy driver.

[01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:33.570]
He was packin' it.

[01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:37.810]
Well, that's good that the clearance came in and slipped his little Mickey while you were taking that mat.

[01:44:38.590 --> 01:44:39.670]
5, 6, 7, 8.

[01:44:39.670 --> 01:44:40.230]
Oh, he calls it.

[01:44:40.710 --> 01:44:41.030]
Yeah.

[01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:42.010]
He calls it Mickey.

[01:44:42.190 --> 01:44:43.250]
Everybody's got a name for it.

[01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.950]
Peter.

[01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:46.270]
Willie.

[01:44:47.550 --> 01:44:51.310]
12, 19, at 5, 60, WQM on a really bizarre Thursday.

[01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:52.070]
Well, I'll tell you.

[01:44:52.450 --> 01:44:54.850]
If we got any word from our programming...

[01:44:54.850 --> 01:44:55.030]
No.

[01:44:56.850 --> 01:44:57.250]
No?

[01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.690]
No?

[01:44:58.130 --> 01:44:59.750]
Well, when is this gonna happen already?

[01:44:59.910 --> 01:45:05.670]
When are they gonna get off the pot and make a decision today is the 26th of June last time I checked.

[01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:08.690]
A moment this day when his Supreme Court said, oh, guess what?

[01:45:08.770 --> 01:45:10.650]
We can't ever extend to him picking in your bedroom.

[01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:12.350]
Which is nice.

[01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:15.350]
But on the other hand, we'd like to find out what's gonna happen to him.

[01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:17.350]
In fact, it's after next week, right?

[01:45:17.690 --> 01:45:17.790]
Right.

[01:45:18.250 --> 01:45:20.290]
And now we start with that I do Tuesday and Thursday.

[01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:22.470]
Although I'm thinking why not help bother doing that, you know?

[01:45:23.010 --> 01:45:23.150]
Sure.

[01:45:23.610 --> 01:45:25.330]
Forget Parallel on there from 8 to noon.

[01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:26.310]
8 to 2.

[01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:27.610]
8 to 2.

[01:45:28.570 --> 01:45:29.770]
Here's a call from Halea.

[01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:31.410]
It's probably a Boeiner Boys Parallel Officer.

[01:45:31.610 --> 01:45:32.190]
Here, Halea.

[01:45:32.290 --> 01:45:32.410]
Hello.

[01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.830]
Halea.

[01:45:36.670 --> 01:45:37.030]
Hola.

[01:45:38.590 --> 01:45:39.190]
Not there.

[01:45:39.670 --> 01:45:40.370]
Well, that's too bad.

[01:45:40.510 --> 01:45:41.990]
You know, we diddled around for a long time.

[01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:43.010]
You're gonna have to be patient.

[01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:45.410]
What else are you gonna do for crying our lives besides bake?

[01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:46.730]
There's nothing going on there.

[01:45:48.270 --> 01:45:49.450]
God, talk about impatient.

[01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:50.970]
The same old crap, man.

[01:45:51.110 --> 01:45:53.770]
If you don't get to him like within two seconds, we can have time for you.

[01:45:54.630 --> 01:45:56.190]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:45:56.410 --> 01:45:59.890]
And you notice the response I had about people admitting about the food benches?

[01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:00.810]
I had to one.

[01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:01.170]
Right.

[01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.970]
We were talking doughnuts.

[01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.870]
That was it.

[01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.770]
The piker.

[01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:05.310]
These people got fat.

[01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:09.650]
They went to bed one night looking like Karen Carpenter and woke up the next day looking like Dom Deloise.

[01:46:09.850 --> 01:46:10.650]
It's amazing, you know?

[01:46:11.290 --> 01:46:16.530]
It was like some kind of an active god that made in fact they heard me talking about fish food on here

[01:46:16.530 --> 01:46:20.770]
and without even eating any of this and they ballooned up like somebody stuck a bicycle pump up their ass.

[01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:22.450]
What is wrong with you people?

[01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:25.270]
North Miami Beach.

[01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.530]
Hello?

[01:46:25.810 --> 01:46:26.450]
Hey, Neil.

[01:46:26.670 --> 01:46:27.270]
Yes, sir.

[01:46:27.370 --> 01:46:27.630]
How's it going?

[01:46:27.710 --> 01:46:28.770]
I got to pick out for you.

[01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:29.570]
Okay, good.

[01:46:29.730 --> 01:46:31.930]
I know you don't like seafood, but I do.

[01:46:32.050 --> 01:46:32.470]
I love it.

[01:46:32.630 --> 01:46:34.270]
And specifically raw oysters.

[01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:35.550]
Ah, good.

[01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.970]
Okay, you're gonna like this.

[01:46:37.230 --> 01:46:39.490]
I have a few friends that share my passion also.

[01:46:39.490 --> 01:46:41.550]
Oh, yeah, they're great.

[01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:47.990]
What we do is we go, we go about like once a week, once every other week and we have what we call oyster orgis.

[01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:52.330]
Basically, we hit the, all the, we hit the, are you can eat raw bars?

[01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:56.310]
And we just, we have a contest on how many oysters we can eat.

[01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:58.190]
You know, we'll go to Enrico's.

[01:46:58.270 --> 01:46:59.830]
They got pretty good oysters or shells.

[01:47:00.090 --> 01:47:06.190]
Anyways, one night, I'm not sure about how many we put down between the three of us, but I know me, myself, I put down.

[01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.710]
Are you ready?

[01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:09.430]
Nine dozen raw oysters.

[01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:10.910]
Oh, my God.

[01:47:11.010 --> 01:47:12.030]
I was so sick at that.

[01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:12.710]
That's 180 weight.

[01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:14.130]
Yes, I did.

[01:47:14.610 --> 01:47:15.250]
Nine dozen.

[01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:16.250]
They're so good though.

[01:47:16.710 --> 01:47:18.810]
So yeah, that's my pick up story.

[01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:20.490]
Oh, well, I feel better now.

[01:47:20.590 --> 01:47:21.190]
What do you think of that?

[01:47:21.530 --> 01:47:22.810]
I think it's grotesque.

[01:47:22.850 --> 01:47:28.290]
Okay, and then I think one is bad enough, but nine doesn't just make, although I guess after the first couple slide down, what difference does it make?

[01:47:28.570 --> 01:47:29.270]
You did exactly.

[01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:31.210]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[01:47:31.330 --> 01:47:31.930]
Hey, Neil.

[01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.510]
Yes.

[01:47:32.710 --> 01:47:34.570]
In closing, this is what we say when we're done.

[01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:36.130]
When we're done eating the oysters.

[01:47:36.130 --> 01:47:37.850]
Shut me, shut me, eat me raw.

[01:47:38.290 --> 01:47:38.650]
Okay.

[01:47:39.210 --> 01:47:40.430]
It isn't going to eat it raw.

[01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:43.030]
5, 6, 7.

[01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:44.610]
All the crap you can unwrap.

[01:47:44.850 --> 01:47:46.370]
All the slime, all the time.

[01:47:46.510 --> 01:47:47.290]
Oh, 5, 60.

[01:47:47.490 --> 01:47:51.670]
5, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:54.570]
He's got a lot of homework to do for that dolphin season, doesn't he?

[01:47:56.130 --> 01:47:58.590]
Got a lot of busy, busy work to take care of.

[01:47:58.670 --> 01:48:01.010]
Plus he's going to get that bag refinished before the season starts.

[01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:03.690]
I wonder what it smells like up in the dolphin booth.

[01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:05.150]
I have to ask the mad dog next time.

[01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:09.810]
You know, hello, he's pretty, he just gives me the hand signals, you know.

[01:48:09.810 --> 01:48:12.770]
Probably just stick his hand to it like that is nostril.

[01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:15.690]
I bet it smells like old spice, like old Jew.

[01:48:18.730 --> 01:48:22.770]
397 votes on the poll, which of these moves by WQM do you like the most?

[01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:24.970]
Neil goes back to 10 to 2.

[01:48:25.090 --> 01:48:27.790]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 162.

[01:48:28.350 --> 01:48:32.150]
41% are ecstatic with 10 to 2 and so am I.

[01:48:32.150 --> 01:48:33.850]
I'm going to be beside my side by each.

[01:48:34.490 --> 01:48:35.890]
Pharrell gets the 8 to 10 slot.

[01:48:36.630 --> 01:48:37.830]
96, that's for now.

[01:48:38.110 --> 01:48:42.030]
Don't forget citylinkmagazine.com, read the big story this week about Scott Pharrell.

[01:48:42.610 --> 01:48:46.510]
We've only had one guy calling and saying, heck, I was, you know, a lot of boring sight.

[01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:47.990]
He was okay with a little low key.

[01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:50.050]
Mo gets jump back an hour 81.

[01:48:50.710 --> 01:48:51.970]
Hank loses an hour 27.

[01:48:51.970 --> 01:48:53.890]
I think that's a little bit of a shot, isn't it?

[01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.590]
Yeah.

[01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:58.530]
Why do you revel in it?

[01:48:58.650 --> 01:48:59.310]
Why do you revel?

[01:48:59.310 --> 01:49:03.250]
Ernie Chancey, yesterday you were denying that you have a bug up your ass about Hank.

[01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:05.230]
He's a good friend. I like Hank a lot.

[01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:06.110]
I love him, I like him.

[01:49:06.330 --> 01:49:06.870]
I never see him.

[01:49:10.170 --> 01:49:12.010]
You're enjoying his memory.

[01:49:12.010 --> 01:49:12.430]
I'm not.

[01:49:12.650 --> 01:49:13.590]
He made a funny line.

[01:49:14.410 --> 01:49:16.490]
Hank, no, I did not make a funny line.

[01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:17.710]
It's sarcastic, of course, that's a thought.

[01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:19.390]
I know that.

[01:49:21.590 --> 01:49:24.430]
Now it's Vena Boyce here to go in there and slap you on the side of the head.

[01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:25.790]
Come on, it's just real hard.

[01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:27.790]
Three or four times, like with a close fist.

[01:49:29.090 --> 01:49:30.710]
Hank loses an hour 27.

[01:49:31.190 --> 01:49:33.550]
No more crow on Marlon broadcast 23.

[01:49:33.970 --> 01:49:36.910]
And a mad dog boasts a 2 to 4, 8 out of 399 votes.

[01:49:37.110 --> 01:49:39.090]
One to verge a 400, it's not even 1230 yet.

[01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:40.230]
That's not too bad.

[01:49:41.590 --> 01:49:43.950]
Consuming the fact that Vena Boyce been a sleep half of the show.

[01:49:44.610 --> 01:49:46.570]
How I'm going to check the bedtime stories right now.

[01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:49.930]
And I'm going to tell you, I'm going to my homepage.

[01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:53.630]
I'm going to check the bedtime stories if the first one.

[01:49:53.630 --> 01:49:55.730]
I don't expect all of them because there's like 18 now.

[01:49:56.110 --> 01:49:58.790]
With the additional one I just sent, which that one should be first, of course.

[01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:02.270]
So that Dennis can see it.

[01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:05.370]
I heard Dennis from Kettle this morning, calm, oh, didn't mention my name.

[01:50:05.370 --> 01:50:06.150]
Nice going, Dennis.

[01:50:06.410 --> 01:50:11.050]
You asked, oh, first time I think I ever, the road to cover up is the road to ruin.

[01:50:11.110 --> 01:50:12.770]
That's the same one we had yesterday, isn't it?

[01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:14.130]
Absolutely correct.

[01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:18.370]
That's the same story that's been festering that spot on our website for like 24 hours.

[01:50:18.670 --> 01:50:19.770]
Absolutely correct.

[01:50:20.010 --> 01:50:21.550]
It doesn't appear to be going anywhere.

[01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:22.950]
Absolutely correct.

[01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:26.890]
Over a place by some of those great new important stories that I fact you guys this morning.

[01:50:27.210 --> 01:50:28.270]
Absolutely correct.

[01:50:28.330 --> 01:50:29.250]
How do you like that?

[01:50:31.210 --> 01:50:34.110]
Any time table when we're going to get the show on a road here, sweetheart?

[01:50:35.050 --> 01:50:36.190]
The story's already changed.

[01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:38.250]
It's just that I don't upload it after every story.

[01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:41.630]
I make a big talk, upload what I have now is about you.

[01:50:41.770 --> 01:50:44.510]
You said you sound so incoherent that there should be a log in this.

[01:50:44.690 --> 01:50:46.250]
You said you you need what?

[01:50:46.570 --> 01:50:48.430]
He's ill in case you hadn't noticed.

[01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:49.290]
No kidding.

[01:50:50.250 --> 01:50:53.590]
What you need to be in the hospital or something, you need to be like an asylum.

[01:50:54.430 --> 01:50:55.090]
It's already was.

[01:50:55.530 --> 01:50:59.350]
You need to be one of those places where Harry's hanging out with the saw.

[01:50:59.910 --> 01:51:00.270]
Yeah.

[01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:02.950]
With the nice police officers that help you.

[01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:05.330]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:07.710]
Don't start cutting yet.

[01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:11.230]
Just run it in the back to where you know it was instilled if you're a god in them.

[01:51:11.450 --> 01:51:11.770]
A little bit.

[01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:13.130]
No more excuses.

[01:51:13.410 --> 01:51:13.590]
No more.

[01:51:13.810 --> 01:51:14.070]
No more.

[01:51:14.150 --> 01:51:14.630]
You know what you're becoming?

[01:51:14.650 --> 01:51:15.870]
You're becoming a sad sack.

[01:51:16.050 --> 01:51:16.510]
You know what that means?

[01:51:17.890 --> 01:51:21.010]
I'm sure that expression is passé just like me.

[01:51:21.370 --> 01:51:22.810]
But you're becoming a sad sack.

[01:51:23.230 --> 01:51:24.950]
Nobody wants to be a sad sack.

[01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:25.370]
Do they know?

[01:51:26.170 --> 01:51:26.170]

[01:51:26.610 --> 01:51:27.770]
Don't be a sad sack.

[01:51:27.850 --> 01:51:28.950]
Okay, butch up a little bit.

[01:51:29.210 --> 01:51:30.050]
Take your head up there.

[01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:31.450]
Stick that stuff in the computer.

[01:51:31.770 --> 01:51:31.890]
Okay.

[01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.970]
Yes sir.

[01:51:32.970 --> 01:51:35.110]
Why do you have to stop a couple of times and get with it.

[01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:37.310]
Those pretend you're not here.

[01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:38.130]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:51:39.290 --> 01:51:40.790]
Instead of this moping around.

[01:51:41.010 --> 01:51:41.330]
I'm open around.

[01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.510]
I'm open around.

[01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:43.710]
I honestly don't want to hear mopey dopey crap.

[01:51:43.710 --> 01:51:45.770]
They want to hear somebody that's like a live and alert like me.

[01:51:45.770 --> 01:51:46.370]
Like Scott.

[01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:47.290]
That's what they want.

[01:51:47.550 --> 01:51:48.070]
Check it out.

[01:51:48.610 --> 01:51:49.110]
That's it.

[01:51:49.230 --> 01:51:51.810]
And by the way, George is going to be doing all the fillings shows this week's summer

[01:51:51.810 --> 01:51:53.190]
in Scott Forell's voice.

[01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.870]
Bring it.

[01:51:54.330 --> 01:51:54.770]
All right.

[01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:56.950]
I'm telling you, he's great doing that voice.

[01:51:57.090 --> 01:51:59.050]
The rest of the time, he blows, but man doing that voice.

[01:51:59.290 --> 01:52:03.130]
In fact, what you're thinking about to think is Forell's filling in on that show.

[01:52:03.230 --> 01:52:04.750]
But it's really going to be George doing Forell.

[01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:08.510]
Oh, he'll probably have to bend down a lot.

[01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:11.950]
There is quite a height difference between that pair.

[01:52:12.610 --> 01:52:13.610]
Hurricane seasons here.

[01:52:13.610 --> 01:52:16.690]
Before storm hits, you put up shutters to protect the windows and doors of your home, of course.

[01:52:17.050 --> 01:52:18.650]
But what about the roof of your house?

[01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:24.150]
The Soma paint factory makes roof masticae roof coating that can help your hurricane proof your roof.

[01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:28.930]
Soma's roof mastics save literally hundreds of roofs during hurricane and roof while unprotected roofs

[01:52:28.930 --> 01:52:30.850]
who are peeding off and flying away all over the place.

[01:52:31.390 --> 01:52:34.590]
Soma's also got waterproof coatings for every kind of roof ever invented.

[01:52:34.930 --> 01:52:39.610]
Called the Soma paint factory at 305-63363333.

[01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:44.550]
The Soma paint factory is the oldest quality paint and waterproof coating manufacturing in the entire state.

[01:52:44.850 --> 01:52:47.610]

[01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:53.570]
They sell to everybody at wholesale prices that are 60% lower than what you'd paint for the same national brands and retail stores.

[01:52:53.970 --> 01:53:00.810]
So protect your home and property from softwoodish tough brutal tropical climate with the best paints and waterproof coatings at unbeatable prices.

[01:53:01.090 --> 01:53:07.750]
Called the Soma paint factory at 305-633333 or find them on the web at Soma.com.

[01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:10.890]
SOMA way. So what is it? SOMA way.

[01:53:11.650 --> 01:53:13.930]
Okay, isn't that right next to a mic miles away?

[01:53:14.650 --> 01:53:23.950]
Soma.com you save money when you buy directly from these Soma paint factory because you're entitled to NEO TORTA TO CALL 305-6336333.

[01:53:25.090 --> 01:53:26.290]
SOMA.com.

[01:53:26.910 --> 01:53:29.010]
This is 20 or by 60.

[01:53:29.550 --> 01:53:30.350]
You way yeah.

[01:53:33.150 --> 01:53:34.470]
NEO GOD OUT.

[01:53:35.730 --> 01:53:36.330]
WQKL.

[01:53:37.050 --> 01:53:39.230]
WHERE THE FACKET IS.

[01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.910]
That's the movie.

[01:53:43.130 --> 01:53:48.190]
The Senate subcommittee on the investigations of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is now in session.

[01:53:48.190 --> 01:53:54.430]
As always due to the majority by the Republican Party, I will share this session. I recognize the Democratic Senator from Florida.

[01:53:54.570 --> 01:54:02.430]
It seems to me that the weapons of mass destruction in fact do not exist in Iraq and we're a false pre-temp for preemptive action as substantiated by the...

[01:54:02.430 --> 01:54:02.870]
Time is up.

[01:54:03.010 --> 01:54:06.150]
Chair calls the vote. All those who believe Saddam had weapons say aye.

[01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:06.630]
Aye.

[01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.470]

[01:54:07.710 --> 01:54:07.890]
Aye.

[01:54:07.890 --> 01:54:09.250]
I have a 3-2 moving on.

[01:54:09.310 --> 01:54:15.190]
Well wait. Several US inspection teams and thousands of soldiers have been searching for 11 weeks they haven't found anything more than just...

[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:18.000]
All those believe they need more time to find the WMD.

[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:19.080]
Opposed?

[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:19.520]
Aye.

[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:19.980]

[01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:21.500]
Aye.

[01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:21.540]

[01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:22.040]
Aye.

[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:22.300]
Opposed?

[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:22.800]

[01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:29.700]
Aye.

[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:35.900]
Opposed?

[01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:39.420]

[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:41.320]

Opposed?

[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:45.380]

[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:45.380]

[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:45.380]

[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:45.380]

[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:49.680]
All in favor of taping the Unpatriotic left-winger to his seat.

[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:50.060]
Aye.

[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:50.860]
Opposed?

[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:51.120]
Aye.

[01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:52.140]
Opposed?

[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:57.780]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:54:57.780 --> 01:55:00.120]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:00.220]
Aye.

[01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:01.940]
Opposed?

[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:10.120]

How you doing? I'm great. How are you? Okay. I'm from Toronto. Really? How's it going?

[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:27.340]
It's going good. I'm driving back in two days. Are you in Toronto right now? I sure am. You are.

[01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:39.740]

[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:54.720]

[01:55:55.540 --> 01:56:04.120]
No, hot and humid. Hot and humid. And I'm painting. And you're going to drive back up? I'm driving back on Saturday morning. I'll be home Sunday night. I'll see you customs.

[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:18.920]
That was a bad story. Coming over here. They almost didn't let me in. Really? Yeah. I thought I was moving in or something. Uh-huh. I thought you were bringing like a box of SARS. Probably. They didn't even ask me. And I had been at the hospital two days before.

[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:30.980]
Two things they don't like smuggling in cigars and SARS. Right. So are you interested? No. Not at all. Not in the least. Listen. Have a great trip. Have a safe trip. Where are you? Where are you in Toronto?

[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:44.520]
Somewhere between the lake and Mississauga. I've been listening to you for years and years. I love you. I love you. Take it. Give me a call, sweetheart. Call me when you get back. Right. Thanks. Uh-huh. Bye.

[01:56:46.400 --> 01:57:00.740]
Oh, my don't these people understand it's a radio show. No. They don't get it. She sounded very nice. I'm glad she's listening. I hope she enjoys the show. I don't want to go to dim sum. Okay. I mean, I didn't to me. The only dim I know was in like clockwork orange.

[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:18.500]
Right. And George, I don't I don't do dim sum. I do a skim op. I mean, conduct bars. Now what is this that somebody older than a far out? Oh, we got an ad in new times. Yes. All right. We're actually publicizing for real, which is good. Scott.

[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:48.480]
What does that say here? Something. Oh, D camp not served here. That's cute. Scott for all sports radio five 60 8 to 10 a.m. week days in the July 2nd. New times. Obviously a trade out. But we'll take it. And so will he. Why isn't that people can't take no for an answer? I mean, see it puts me like in this squarry position. I'm not going to like. You follow what I'm saying? No. Yes, you do. No. So on your fault. I know you and that. You have an idea. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going

[01:57:48.480 --> 01:58:18.360]
to go to the gym now. Like what we got in there, all your fault. You know what I mean? What did I say to you a couple weeks ago, Dr. Frankenstein. You invented a monster. Now it's out of control. And now you just struck your arms. Well, I don't I've done to do it. We want me to. Be them up a little bit. Or pick like a computer damn it. I'll do that. You're gonna want to give us. Not the problem. Okay. You've got a wonderful computer sitting there right there brand new out of the box which I spent. Zillion of my heart $1,000. We could have a good

[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:20.400]
piece of equipment. What's the problem with that?

[01:58:23.780 --> 01:58:31.520]
Oh, but I had to reload a software and it's kind of a little bit different. So catching up. Yeah, you're catching up. All right. We've got balls

[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:36.960]
560 WQM. We're going to add the also in the new times. I bet there's a whole series of these come aren't there.

[01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:42.060]
Are you fixing these to me or are they coming from someplace else in the building? Both.

[01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:56.340]
Oh, but so it backs them to us also in the building. They've got stuff to the box. I passed them along. Oh, great. We've got balls. How do you like that? Donna Shalala. Oh, it doesn't say UM on there. What a pussy man. That was the one of the most embarrassing

[01:58:56.340 --> 01:59:05.380]
episodes and there have been so many in our 10 year QAM. Donna Shalala gets a phone call or a letter or whatever. She should of course consider the source anyway,

[01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:15.140]
but she gets a letter and right away. Oh, well, we don't want the U of M associated with that. That's disgusting. We demand that you take the UM logo off that billboard. We've got balls.

[01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:24.300]
And of course, we all know that the U of M doesn't have any balls. So what's the big surprise? Okay. You know, at least she's consistent.

[01:59:24.420 --> 01:59:34.960]
Married. Big bow. Amen. Here's a call from Hollywood. Hello. Alcoville. Yes, sir. How you doing, babe? Pretty good. Nice to talk to you again. Spent a while.

[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:41.780]
Good show today. I got to say the website has been totally kicking butt. Oh, yeah.

[01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:47.600]
Wait for me. Wait for me. Wait for me here about the new guy we're going to get to do the website. The guy that has his own computer.

[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:58.760]
I think for all it's cool. It seems like it's. It's breathed a little life into your building over there. A little life. It's like we were on life support before they brought this guy in. Okay.

[01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:03.360]
We were like gasping for oxygen. They screwed up the line up. They moved me back to nine. We were dying

[02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:06.920]
We were falling a hostile old man and now all of a sudden we got a life back

[02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:11.820]
It's like being able to second chance and the thing about for real too, which is awesome is that you and Emma

[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:15.940]
Pretty much the hockey authorities and it's nice to have somebody out there who weighs in and

[02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:20.980]
Actually knows what they're talking about for the you know for the few hockey fans that you have down here

[02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:25.940]
And you do have a good point because even though guilty knows this stuff the fact is he's so intimidated by Moe

[02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:27.820]
He's terrified even mentioned a word

[02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:32.400]
I love the way I love the way you rip him and that's Moe's other clown is the

[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.300]
Shizziness I love it

[02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:38.460]
I won't eat him. I can't money so that and I bet you he did too

[02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:43.420]
Well, Neil nice to talk to you again, and when you leave, I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do

[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:46.140]
Okay, well go off for some dinsum. How do you like that?

[02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:50.760]

[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:53.560]

[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:55.600]
One of them is the good

[02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:58.560]
Okay, you got him in thank you for a second. Say goodbye

Aren't they except for being a boy who's out of sorts?

[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:12.700]
Now I asked your question before about how much it would cost to get him a nice new elective and you like but it'd be better

[02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:16.880]
I said I want a number. I don't want I don't want pull crap. I just want a number

[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:21.860]

[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:23.200]

Well, it was behind a cage, but I called ahead. Oh, I made relations. He made reservations. I really did

[02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:29.660]
So I don't want to get hank into up. You know a bucket of crap. All you probably would

[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:35.820]
But uh, not necessarily that day that was a day to remember remember that movie and a fair to remember

[02:08:35.820 --> 02:08:40.420]
This was a day to remember it'll go down in the emails of broadcast experience

[02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:46.360]
Our appearance at the seminal Indian Hollywood casino in a beautiful Hollywood

[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:51.500]
Scelling road and uh, whatever 441 and it wouldn't have been the same without electric wheelchair man

[02:08:51.500 --> 02:08:54.000]
knocking the chairs over trying to get to see you. Oh, yeah

[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.900]
Let me spin the wheel one more time. Here we go

[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:05.100]
Oh my god the the oldest person there the youngest person there was like 98

[02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:09.120]
Get not counting us. I was gonna say the oldest was death plus 10

[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:12.280]
Here's for a water deal. Hello

[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:19.020]
Hey Neil. Yes, sir. Got a question for you and did some country. Okay. They got the best health care up there

[02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:21.940]
How come 40 people died or 30 days from SARS?

[02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:24.280]
What the hell does that mean?

[02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:27.120]
How come people how come people die from pneumonia?

[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:32.920]
Oh, and that's what I was just saying and you're asking nobody's died that's what I'm saying we're so close. I mean

[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:34.600]
I thought the health care so

[02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:41.580]
Good there or whatever think we you know what it is. It's like saying how come people died in in Taiwan from it

[02:09:41.580 --> 02:09:45.740]
It was just the luck of the draw. That's all somebody got it over there and came here and brought it here

[02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:51.140]
And by the time they were trying to get a cap on it. It was already spread to four hospitals. That's why

[02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:55.700]
In addition to which do you really believe that nobody in the West has died from SARS? Do you believe that?

[02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:58.680]
Yeah, I don't

[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:03.600]
You think people have I want you to look up something on the internet. Okay. Go do a Google search of

[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:12.780]
pneumonia three. Okay, and the fourth definition of it is SARS severe acquired a respiratory whatever it stands for look at up pneumonia three

[02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:15.360]
By the way, the health care up there is both the

[02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:17.260]
great and

[02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:19.740]
I know I wouldn't say the health care is great in fact

[02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:21.260]
And in Toronto that's one of the

[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:26.300]
Offshoots of the way they handled the whole sourcing they're forming at them out about it. They didn't handle it right

[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:31.760]
I never told you the health care here was great. I mean they have socialized to medicine

[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:34.600]
They got health care for the public which is more than I can say about the state

[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:36.680]
But to say that it's great. I never would say to that

[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:38.260]
Just

[02:10:40.060 --> 02:10:45.920]
There's one vacation and just a lot of Chinese people of info you know came into that area

[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:49.960]
Yeah, I guess I have a lot of people going back and forth maybe

[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:54.480]
Sure, there was one person who came here from China that had SARS

[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:59.800]
Went into the hospital with it and that's where it came from it wasn't in the chair. Oh, I don't I don't I can't handle it

[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:03.780]
I can't handle it. I can't take it just like Mike Myers said it just it's first reading

[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:08.400]
I mean, what's the point? I mean we make up the death rate in any other category you name it

[02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:15.480]
In addition to which the thing that's the big topic here right now is the guns the enormous number of guns that are being imported from the good

[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:23.360]
Old USA and resulting in a number of increased number of murder and violent crimes being committed with guns that are being imported across the border

[02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:29.660]
You know again, I'm not I'm not here for the Canadian chamber of commerce the Toronto or Ontario chamber of commerce

[02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:33.600]
You live where you like it and I live most of the time where I like it which is not in South Florida

[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:37.480]
Forget about it

[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:42.820]
Here's like I'm making some kind of a pitch for the chamber here or like a SARS relief pitch

[02:11:42.820 --> 02:11:45.740]
I'm not doing that stay where you are stay where the hell you are

[02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:51.140]
5670560 although I will say you know I had that thing here remember when I had to get my

[02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:52.540]
prescription

[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:58.780]
Yes, and I went to a free clinic while I wasn't free was like oh, it's free for Canadians. I'm not a Canadian citizen

[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:04.440]
And I got the I went to see the doctor. I told him about the situation because they won't take American prescriptions

[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:09.320]
And he wrote me to prescript he said to me how many do you want I told him I've been taken it for a long time. I brought him the empty bottle

[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:10.200]
How many do you want?

[02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:11.700]
right

[02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:19.880]
I've heard of an American doctor saying how many do you want because the American doctors want to have you keep coming back and back and back and back just to write you the prescription so many of them

[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:24.060]
And I told him what I wanted he writes me the prescription. I go out and I said how much do you

[02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:28.200]
35 bucks Canadian which at the time was like a 21 bucks

[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:30.000]
21 bucks

[02:12:32.460 --> 02:12:36.440]
That's incredible. It is incredible and of course keep in mind the Canadian people were in there

[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:38.600]
They were paying nothing because they had their health card

[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:43.900]
But God forbid we should do that God forbid everybody in America should have health care

[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:48.280]
God forbid that the drug company should stop being able to rape the goddamn public now

[02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:50.720]
We don't want to stop that because that's all commerce man

[02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:52.180]
Commerce

[02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:58.500]

[02:12:58.500 --> 02:13:01.380]
It Canada sure his health is not perfect make no mistake about that

[02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:06.080]
They got a real inferiority complex. I've heard of that even before I came here. It's sad

[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:12.480]
And they shouldn't have one because they're light years ahead of the US in terms of their their social attitudes in terms of a whole

[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:13.520]
bunch of different things

[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:16.700]
In terms of the way they treat each other in terms of the way they view each other

[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:17.840]
But

[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:22.980]

[02:31:51.880 --> 02:31:55.320]
those things where you can't go out and buy whatever the hell you want because the government is trying

[02:31:55.320 --> 02:31:59.780]
to like you know uh influence what kinds of cigars you smoke with air foreign policy which is a bunch

[02:31:59.780 --> 02:32:04.820]
of schmit but i gave up cigars quite a while ago i shouldn't say that because then Ken helper won't

[02:33:16.840 --> 02:33:21.480]
trial is on oh here you go there's a lot of speculation but we don't know one way or the other

[02:33:21.480 --> 02:33:26.600]
i can give you a little bit of humanizing of this defendant what i understand about her background

[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:30.900]
is that you know something you you're never going to believe this if you live to be five thousand

[02:33:31.420 --> 02:33:36.000]
how often have i turned on court tv since i've been here in the let's two years now i don't know twice

[02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:39.780]
think financial verdict just came in and she's guilty of murder

[02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:44.780]
it's on her house actually really the job right for long time she finally thought she was

[02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:49.160]

[02:33:49.160 --> 02:33:54.860]
further in my pile you know i got my piles over here yeah and i just i just leave through and i

[02:33:54.860 --> 02:33:58.380]

[02:34:10.460 --> 02:34:14.840]
alive in the broken windshield of a car that he probably would have survived if the driver had

[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:18.660]

[02:34:18.660 --> 02:34:23.120]

[02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:42.620]
doctor what was irrelevant at guilt innocence phase was a degree of pain this man suffered he was

[02:34:42.620 --> 02:34:47.420]
begging for his life as to the life of time and she went inside and had sex with her boyfriend while

[02:34:47.420 --> 02:34:50.880]
he was out there pleading on the stuck on a windshield while he was dying on her windshield

[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:57.880]
is the time for this jury to learn as gruesome as it may be how painful this was you can only

[02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:04.140]
imagine having your leg amputated in a garage you know a public highway and then hanging there for

[02:35:04.140 --> 02:35:09.920]
a period of time only to be wrapped in a blanket and thrown onto a public park this is the time for

[02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:16.180]
the jury to learn that and as to jenka saw us uh and this being a daddy's mommy's girl trying to

[02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:55.740]
no it does not oh not at all no because they can't give us our life back see what i'm saying

[02:43:55.740 --> 02:44:00.880]
the time those that year that would be like running somebody over with your car like that bitch in

[02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:06.800]
Texas and unlike inviting them to dinner it just doesn't quite compensate here's a call from my

[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:30.940]
business who you start you know you hear his i'm not talking about imitating what he does on the

[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:55.660]
end of the show Scott for hours coming up next year you're hurting do that absolutely but

[02:44:55.660 --> 02:44:59.700]
that's right you have it the George cuz you don't listen to him or come on where he needs your help

[02:44:59.700 --> 02:45:06.200]
i'm gonna start listening no you're not economy down bushes re-election support wow

[02:45:06.940 --> 02:45:13.000]
this is from the brit guardian unlimited president bush bask in high approval ratings but when

[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:17.940]
potential voters are pressed about giving him a second term the numbers drop a reflection of

[02:45:17.940 --> 02:45:21.780]
worries about the struggling economy in a general wait and see attitude so far ahead of the election

[02:45:22.620 --> 02:45:27.160]
bushes overall approval ratings have remained at 60% or higher in most polls since 9-11

[02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:30.940]
but now that the electorate is turning the thinking about bushes handling of the economy

[02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:34.800]
and wondering who the democrats will nominate the presents re-election numbers are at 50% or

[02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:41.520]
lower in several polls in a recent CNN USA today gala pool 50% said they would vote for bush

[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:46.520]
38% back the unarmed democratic candidate with the rest undecided those numbers aren't very

[02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:50.880]
different from those garnered by bushes father in June of 91 when the commander in chief was

[02:45:50.880 --> 02:45:54.760]
praised for the west of session the Persian Gulf War and the democrats were scrambling for a candidate

[02:45:54.760 --> 02:46:00.140]
and of course as most of us will recall Bill Clinton defeated lambasted George Herbert Walker

[02:46:00.140 --> 02:46:05.920]
bush in 92 election with job approval you're asking how they feel right now said frank newport

[02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:10.060]
editor-in chief of the gala pool bushes job approval ratings will naturally reflect his potential

[02:46:10.060 --> 02:46:15.160]
to march re-eval next year he said the current poll also found that 37% democrats

[02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:19.700]
approve a bush's job performance but only a third of those democrats who approve would vote

[02:46:19.700 --> 02:46:24.520]
to re-elect them among independence the re-elect numbers weren't as high as the approval ratings

[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:29.440]
what this means is that democrats and independence who lean democratic still want to consider

[02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:35.220]
other choices said Andrew Kahoot he's in Kahoot's with him directly pure search center for the

[02:46:35.220 --> 02:46:38.700]
people in the press bush will still have to convince swing voters that he's the right person for

[02:46:38.700 --> 02:46:49.680]
the job once the democratic candidate emerges i think one thing that the president probably ought to

[02:46:50.540 --> 02:46:56.000]
don't be snorting again okay everybody heard that that was George yeah George is snorted

[02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:00.060]
i was my impersonation of l president type you're lucky that uh Rick Riley and here

[02:47:00.820 --> 02:47:05.120]
every time somebody would snort on here he'll especially if he did it like it was like a major

[02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:10.220]

Bill Clinton speaks to a crowd of 750 people Tuesday

[02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:14.940]
have known condemned the Bush administration policies

[02:52:14.940 --> 02:52:18.440]
that he said are undoing progress made during his presidency and that are delaying

[02:52:18.440 --> 02:52:21.480]
progress toward affirmative action goals in his folksy style

[02:52:22.420 --> 02:52:26.180]
the former president departed often from his prepared remarks and referred to his host

[02:52:26.180 --> 02:52:30.900]
of Jesse Jackson as brother Jackson his speech focused primarily on the Bush tax cut

[02:52:30.900 --> 02:52:35.720]
which Clinton said would yield him as a member of a high income bracket next to 80 grand a year

[02:52:36.280 --> 02:52:40.760]
tax grades would be better put to use showing up education and health care programs for children

[02:52:40.760 --> 02:52:43.680]
and Clinton there are jobs programs such as AmeriCorps he said

[02:52:43.680 --> 02:52:47.940]

[02:53:48.040 --> 02:53:53.920]

those wounded children that he was moved to tears when he couldn't help them speak couldn't help

[02:53:58.220 --> 02:54:03.240]
them speaks volumes about him in the decency of the human spirit and hella situations but for

[02:54:03.240 --> 02:54:07.240]
those of us watching from the comfort of our home don't shed too many tears for these particularly

[02:54:07.240 --> 02:54:12.020]

[02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:31.000]
them for the children to be born of the veterans of this war and for the hundreds of generations of

Iraqi children yet unborn will come into this life defective and sick from the genetic

[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:39.300]
effects of depleted uranium weaponry save them for those here who'll be victims of the violence
