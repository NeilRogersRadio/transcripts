[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]
Neal's teaching me how to count and state my money because I'm gonna need it when QAM does me.

[00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.900]
So I'll hook you up with a real good stockbroker, Mitch Hirsch.

[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:08.540]
Hahaha!

[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.680]
By the way, the Dow is down!

[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.680]
BAPTURED, MAN!

[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.760]
And then ask Dex up one point something.

[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.180]
Thanks.

[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.960]
What the hell we need that third burger runner?

[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.980]
We can sit here and look how they're...

[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.700]
There's my old buddy David Ted today.

[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.240]
Let's start making fun of me when I'm doing my financial update to get my sponsor happy.

[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.620]
I'm not gonna do that right before my short.

[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.900]
It sounds like sabotage.

[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.280]
No, I'm doing it at 9.4.

[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.560]
What that financial stuff did for Rick and I was spud.

[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.320]
I went to the hockey game yesterday.

[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.400]
And then you tell me that the beast has taken you down there and trying to inject you into that whole U.M. cesspool down there.

[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.900]
That's bad.

[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.460]
Yeah.

[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.040]
You don't want to, you don't want to like...

[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.420]
That was sure here today.

[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.940]

[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.700]

[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.420]
We're eating shrimp over here.

[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.880]
I love the macaroni grill and they love me as a matter of fact.

[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.020]
I just don't like that old black sandal guy that gets up on the table with those big shoes.

[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.100]
How about your Italian?

[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.440]
That old man, River, do you ever see that?

[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.700]

[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.620]

[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.560]

[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.460]
Hey, we told him we're on the case but he's just still laying down on the job.

[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.100]
I don't think he's me.

[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.220]
What did he do?

[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.120]
What in George give me the contact so I can go do another deal.

[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.740]
He's laying down when he come right down to it.

[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.660]
He is my contact.

[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.360]
I mean, he's saying something about scalp and Todd Dreck.

[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.600]
I always do I like Ferrell.

[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.960]

[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.800]
Yeah, Luanne comes in here every morning and wears a little flash on me.

[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.540]
She wants to do it.

[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.660]
Yeah, they all do.

[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.260]
What's a doggy game?

[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.800]
What's the name of that?

[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.820]
I can't believe any Dave Bree behind you.

[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.660]
Hey, you know I saw last night your buddy Jeff Rivers said hi.

[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.260]
Yeah?

[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.740]
Oh, he saw another one.

[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.880]
Do you know the guy that was at the game?

[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.420]
You and Scott?

[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.540]
Yeah, I was the only one that was shot over the else.

[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.460]
And in turn Brian, who gives Scott great deals on American Airlines.

[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.360]
Don't you love the way they put these things in a box score?

[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.660]
13,274.

[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.700]
If there were 7,000 people there last night, my name is Mohawar David.

[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.580]
Okay, I was pathetic.

[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.540]

[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.540]
There was nobody.

[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.340]

[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.100]

[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.560]

[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.600]
I'd give myself a little present didn't take any cause

[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.460]
Which was great

[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.420]

[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.080]

[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.080]

[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:33.600]

[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.680]
Outpouring of emotion and the love and kindness and caring

[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.480]
It's a very warm fuzzy thing

[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.640]
That's how I played the CBC thing yesterday

[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.580]
The 5th of state or whatever the hell that thing is called

[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.180]

[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.580]
Di conspiracy

[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.160]
Yeah and anyway that's why I played it

[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.480]
And of course the Scott and his dad are still trying to figure out what it was

[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.900]
They thought it was a public service announcement

[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.800]
And then read from the Michael Moore book which still know

[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.120]
But nobody cares about any of that

[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.360]
But I did my best and maybe they're like a handful of people out there in the audience

[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.340]
But hey this is pretty damn interesting and we're getting pissed off and parted up about it

[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.220]
And the rest of the people are like

[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.040]
Oh gee when's you going to take some calls

[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.100]

[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.360]

[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.500]
1466 votes on the point yesterday

[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.260]
What's your take on the Iraq war?

[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.600]
63.2% of our nearly 1500 votes said in peach George W. Bush and I say those people are

[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.300]
Absolutely correct sir

[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.620]
927 when peach is asked

[00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.860]
I want the troops by the way two more dead troops I want the troops to come home 201

[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.180]
Let's stay the course it'll take time 197

[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.080]
Right we need to send more troops for security 63

[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:13.520]
Rumsfeld should be fired 46 and I don't care about any of it 32 hurricane fans by the way there you go

[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.380]
Bees 32 of your cohorts of your mindless idiots like you in clearance

[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.360]
Hurricane fans they have to be 2.1% that I don't care about any of it

[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.660]
As in what me worry and we should have a lot of people saying what we were

[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:30.240]
We got Alfred E. Newman for president right yeah to be the national motto we got the Bobby Hatfield died

[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.440]
He died and in the baseball player who died he died and all kinds of stuff going on in two more soldiers

[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.100]
Right yeah but who's counting

[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:44.480]
But we're only counting Americans in the coalition we're not counting the Iraqis because it's so many thousand now we lost track

[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.300]
And addition to which the president and Rumsfeld can't count that high

[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:54.680]
Russian he'll help me get that high 1013 at 560 WQ I am absolutely I know

[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.480]
He had people jumpy when they heard of

[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.060]
Farhan

[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.040]
Monday morning went to get some ammo

[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.260]
Tuesday he goes shooting with his son

[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.760]
Wednesday they get busted by the phone

[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:39.060]
They found the gun

[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.060]
My firm a helmet part of a psychopath

[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.480]
And we won't be happy to leave him

[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.060]
1018 at 560 WQ I am so we got a big appearance today right

[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:08.660]
Miguel's gonna be out there showing it or somebody I beg your pardon somebody will be out there

[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.440]
What do you mean by that?

[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:15.780]
Well it's pouring cats and dogs out there it's pitch black nobody wants to go out there so they're gonna have a fight over who gets to do it

[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.640]
And it's raining too

[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.240]
Well maybe we had a like postponement instead if the weather's that bad

[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.860]
As another fact I was gonna tell you expect the power to go out down here on this end without notice at any good

[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:26.940]
Well let me know did it go out yet

[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.020]
I'll just put my feet up on the table here watch a playboy TV or something

[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.900]
Or watch Harvey Levin the screaming fruitcake talking about Rosio Donald

[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:42.640]
It rent to break the lease that's essentially what Rosia saying that it was made so unbearable that she had a legal we don't care about that bitch

[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:51.040]
Now what was I just saying what how about we postpone it we could do that yeah tell Miguel that we in fact all we want from him today is just a number

[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.880]
Just a total would be nice just a number because I'm sure that everybody yesterday being my birthday

[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.540]
And I didn't let people call in see and lady was very nice that I just took that call

[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.760]
But we could add three hours of that yesterday and I would not have been very illuminating or entertaining or exciting

[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.100]
I mean she was great and thank you very much but who wants to hear that for three hours right?

[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.860]
Right they kind of like talking about hockey

[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:15.120]
Yeah we could have talked about hockey and had a point and point zero zero zero

[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.900]
In fact you saw yourself last night the tremendous interest in hockey and self-flora

[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.960]
Well that was 4,300 people were actually there in the seats probably half of which were giveaways

[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.700]
I don't know how they're gonna make it I don't understand how that franchise is gonna survive

[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:34.380]
There's nobody showing up I mean they can put 50,000 in a paper in a box score it doesn't make make them any money

[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.880]
It's a crap

[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:43.600]
Hey here's our cool question today before we go I'd like to get the number Miguel because I'm sure that everybody bought some of our best meals

[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.180]
Stuff yesterday on our my birthday were probably a bloody you think yeah no how many people do you think

[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:55.720]
I doubted we had 37,295 for band and pay rest you as of whenever I give you the number last time I guess on Monday

[00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:00.140]
He just just keeps ignoring us well Doreen keeps him busy running

[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:07.600]
Here's the poll today who is or was the biggest drooling Yahoo of them all when was I talking about drooling Yahoo's the other one?

[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.760]
When you came back because of the upset poll

[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.820]
That's right that should have been on there drooling Yahoo's man they just make my skin crawl

[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:20.500]
Anybody who talk like this I know there are Mooran I don't care how many college degrees they got

[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:30.400]
I'll try to get a perm loudly for me oh man you talk about dumb who is or was the biggest drooling Yahoo of them all we got a short list and how come you didn't put Toby Keith on there yet

[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:39.280]
I wrote it on the paper well he didn't put it on there I guess I guess Eric psychic power he must have known that was your choice he just hates you

[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:48.420]
Jesse Helm strong thermon and Toby Keith just to get just for a starter there I don't even know who Toby Keith is you already explained it to me don't waste time on a year but I don't know who that is

[00:15:50.500 --> 00:16:04.240]
You will I will what you will know him no I will not know him I'm not going to go anywhere near him anyway bad news on this story about the possible deal that we could have avoided invading Iraq that goes to show you right there

[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:14.600]
It's another piece of the puzzle right there fraud you doubting Thomas isn't a dicks out there we'll get to that two more Americans killed in separate incidents Polish major wounded and exchange of fire

[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:23.680]
Two American soldiers killed in separate incidents and your bag that along the Syrian border the US military said today and a Polish major was seriously wounded in the ambush south of the capital

[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:31.580]
A senior figure from the US led coalition warned that the Americans and their allies face a rough winter of attacks by insurgents and now we're sending in the Marines

[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.640]
And we're sending in a hundred thousand troops not in addition but like replacement troops in the beginning of the year

[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:44.020]
Because these other people are like a little bit on the burn outside never expected to be there like the rest of their lives maybe and so

[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.540]
So there's going to be a lot more dead bodies is basically what it boils down to and then you look at this story and it really makes you more pissed off

[00:16:50.540 --> 00:17:01.800]
I don't want to get any of my pissed off but if you'd like to be pissed off a possible negotiated peace deal was laid out in a heavily guarded compound in Baghdad and the days before the war ABC news has been told

[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:08.820]
But the top former Pentagon adviser says he was ordered not to pursue the deal because that would have screwed up all their plans you see

[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:15.420]
This the fix was already in this was already engraved in stone it was carved in granite before the even stolen election

[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.780]
The PNAC people already had their meeting and they decided that they were going to go in there and they find some excuse

[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:27.100]
There'd be some catastrophic catastrophic event that would take place and then they'd have a reason to go in there

[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.120]
Not that we're suggesting anything no of course that

[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:39.880]
I just was very afford to it is for them a prominent levities American businessman said he secretly met with a raki intelligence officials just days after

[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:45.460]
Secretariat state colon Powell lied through his teeth and laid out the US case for the war if you went in prebor with all the maps

[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.160]
Got that map he's got the middle east peace road map all his maps seem to be like outdated just like the time we bomb the Chinese embassy that time

[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.860]
Oops from an old map my back and a mistake

[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:03.720]
I'm on the Hague the president of American underwriter group insurance company and known in the region is having contacts that they Pentagon told ABC news

[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.620]
He was first approached by an Iraqi intelligence official who arrived unannounced at his office in Beirut

[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:15.200]
A week later according to Hague he had an associate where has to come to Baghdad when Hague said he met with Saddam Hussein's chief of intelligence

[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.400]
General Tahir Habush later labeled the jack of diamonds and that silly deck of cards

[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.960]
The pick the most wanted members of Saddam Hussein's regime publishes still at large he was conveying a message

[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:34.520]
Said Hague he was conveying an offer he said he laid out terms of a negotiated piece during a four hour session beginning at midnight at a compound in Baghdad

[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:45.980]
Hague said Habush repeated public analysis by the regime that Iraq had a weapon to mass destruction but offered to allow several thousand US agents or scientists free reign in the country to carry out inspections

[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:52.920]
Based in my meeting with this man said hey I think an effort was there to avert war they were prepared to meet with high ranking US officials

[00:18:53.620 --> 00:19:00.940]
And a Pentagon said uh uh no way Jose we want that shock and awe and a lot of dead bodies and they got both

[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:06.560]
Now let's see here's the fact that just came in it's an unbelievable or maybe at this point we should expect it from the president

[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:14.660]
It seems that he sold Congress a bill of goods again couple of weeks back Congress including Republicans voted to make part of the Iraq package repayable loans instead of all grants

[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:20.880]
Then according to representative Herald Ford Jr. Democratic Tennessee when the two bills from both houses had to be reconciled and voted on again this week

[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:28.320]
The president pleaded with Congress to make all the funds grants only because if the rest of the world sees that even the US won't give grants direct they won't make any of their pledge contributions at all

[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.580]
However the president got this wrong to a point of representative forward as soon as Congress voted this week for the grants

[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.860]
Two thirds of other pledging countries provided aid in the form of you guessed it loans

[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:46.140]
Loans, loans so in other words they're smart and we're dumb they're loading the money but they wanted back to they got all that oil there which ain't going to end anytime soon

[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.040]
But we said oh no we don't want to do that we don't want to lay all that debt on the backs of the Iraqi children in the future

[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:56.600]
So we'll add a back of all you Americans and your kids for the future for generations to come billions and billions and billions and billions

[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:03.040]
And everybody's going like that what time to ballgame give me the ball give me the ball give me the ball that's that kind of crap

[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.060]
Bad news

[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.880]
Too much bad news you know I know stop plus I got the little ear infection that I caused myself I had like a little thing in my ear

[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.000]
Ever have a little thing in your ear all the time

[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:23.580]
And I you know kept picking it picking at it and of course they they was you know just fine I picked at the scab and then now I realize I had like a little pain in there

[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:30.420]
So I'm taking my antibiotics again and plus George told me stick something in there and I did my answer for everything

[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:37.180]
Yeah stick something in there some polyspawn in fact you know something's getting better already is that possible maybe is it an analgesic

[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:42.840]
What do you mean by that like oh no I mean is it a pain killer yeah or I just an analgesic

[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.440]
No I think pain killer is some sort of pseudo intellectuals

[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:51.980]
Absolutely you know it's an antibiotic cream prevents infection to help speed healing and worse fast like just like that

[00:20:53.620 --> 00:21:02.960]
Singer Bobby Hatfield died he died he died 63 years old half the team known as the righteous brothers of you lost that love and feel and fame

[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:08.680]
He died yesterday poli said what was the other big one you lost that what was it oh geez

[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.160]
Well it's just brothers right come on

[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:21.780]
I'm saying no it ain't a shameality there you go that I'm saying that you stole from Al Hibbler

[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:27.420]
Thanks to Boca Brian who's living in the past like me Hatfield's bought by the way bad disc this week Boca Brian really weak stuff

[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:34.200]
Hatfield's body was taken to the Kalamazoo County Medical Examiner's office for an autopsy and the statement was to be issued later but they don't say like when

[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:42.600]
Hatfield and partner Bill Medley met in Orange County California performed together for 41 years according to the group's website you've lost that love and feel and recorded in 1964

[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.960]
Stanzas the most played song on a radio and we are sick and nausea we don't we're not happy that he died

[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:59.100]
But we're sick of that song and the righteous brothers in general so I guess you could look at it trying to find something good out of tragedy right finding a little silver lying in the middle of a dark cloud

[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:04.240]
The fact that he did die but in a course now we're gonna hear more than ever so like I said it's even worse

[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:11.420]
Because now there be all these tributes in fact wax you'll probably I mean magic are probably play like 24 hours non stop

[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:16.540]
Other righteous brothers those two songs they'll just segue back and forth because that Hamilton guy what's his name Bob Hamilton

[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:28.660]

Oh, let's check another tea

[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:28.780]
Oh, the Jessica Simpsons because people this dumb could only be in cartoons

[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.140]
Right

[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:35.560]
We can only pray 1032 at 560 WQM suited to make up bring a number in or what?

[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.340]
Shut up

[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.520]
Jesus Christ

[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:43.560]
See what I'm telling you just like that all I'm asking for you in a chance to cancel the thing today because it's raining

[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:49.320]
We won't raise 50 cent you can sit there. We can just hang out with Doreen. He can hang it right out. She can take a look at it

[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.160]
Sniff it

[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.400]
But in the meantime we need a number we got like 38,000 yet coming at you

[00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:01.300]
He can just say it you don't need to like print it out I can actually like almost 38,000 how much

[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.280]
37, 8,95

[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.140]
Oh 8,95 so that's something for us to work on today

[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:11.320]
We only need 105 bucks to get 38,000 so maybe Greg Reed instead of running around showing his pussie

[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:16.580]
Ousing sourced everybody in a building see that's a real rocket scientist that tells you what a moron we work for

[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.960]
They got strep girl going around all over the building at QAM

[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.880]
And you think that anybody who's got it would have enough intelligence to stay the hell away from there

[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.500]
But if you do if you know feel compelled to come in here because you're so freaking important

[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:33.500]
You don't go running around opening up your mouth and showing everybody you're using pustules and

[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.400]
Chancers and stuff like that because that's a great way to spread it you know what I'm saying

[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.760]
But when you do know what a guy who spends most of his time with his finger in his head looking for where his brain was

[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:47.000]
And it sounds like that what do you expect you an idiot Greg nothing changes

[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.440]
So we got 37,895 now does that include like from the internet and everything too?

[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:53.280]
Yes

[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:59.700]
Well that means we got 600 bucks yesterday I tell you one thing I don't know why I worked my ass off and

[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:03.480]
Said the alarm got up one o'clock in the morning to tape that CBC thing so I could play it yesterday

[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.680]
And go through the whole song and dance and edit off the spots and try to like you know do something

[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.600]
Because if it meant anything every line on the board would be lit up right now from people saying

[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.040]
God that was really pissed me off and it was great and thanks for doing that you know I mean something something

[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.300]
Or or even saying what I was sure boring don't ever do that again something

[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:28.160]
Mm-hmm they have no passion no passion now let's see next van hit appearance tomorrow rain or shine

[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.300]
I see them as because it's a commercial thing

[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.540]
Is that what he's trying to say?

[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.940]
Rain or shine tomorrow will have now this is the for all one is that well I see for us because he's got an appearance to make

[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:41.440]
Scott for out you can go there and see if he really talks like that in person which he does

[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.880]

[00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:01.020]
No, into two and a little more more about that so that's rain or shine because he's gonna get paid for it

[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.440]
And actually anybody gets paid for something and we want him to show up even if nobody else is gonna

[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:10.640]
37 8 95 105 bucks we ought to be able to collect that just in cash before 11 o'clock inside the building right

[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.300]
Well, why do you keep 105 bucks to get us to 38 grand?

[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:22.360]
This is the worst fundraiser I've ever been associated with in my life this even makes the OJ center one thing

[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.220]
Pale into one significance. That's how desperate this has been

[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.720]
They not only don't care enough to send their very best they don't want to send nothing

[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:35.240]
Now we got to get some more names for that pool although I will say strom thermo to jump to the races

[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:44.020]
For a dead guy and strom thermo he did die didn't he? Yeah, I think so. I'm not positive. I'm not sure

[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:51.440]
Strom thermo 18 Toby Keith 8 and Jesse Helm 7 the first 33 votes on who's the biggest july Yahoo of them all

[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.560]
I like that I can't because july Yahoo's I find extraordinarily offensive

[00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:02.040]
And you'll find plenty of them in Canada your fundamental Calgary you'll find like in the Saskatchewan in Mousja

[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:07.720]
Got plenty of red necks. We're talking about that yesterday. There's different kind of red necks

[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.040]
There's the ones on that picture that I showed you the about the

[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.700]
Yeah, look like they just came up from a tree for the weekend

[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:23.400]
And then there's the Texas deep south Mississippi Louisiana y'all come back like judge more kind of Alabama with a banjo on unique and then there's the other ones with a banjo

[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:28.820]
But they're up in the tree the beesleys that kind of redneck the maple slower to redneck

[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.940]
Cincinnati boy more too much bad news. I'm gonna go back and hide under the bed. I don't like this

[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.560]
Cincinnati Reds outfielder Dernnell

[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:47.000]
Stinson was found dead early yesterday on a residential street after he was shot and apparently run over in a Phoenix suburb police said

[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.080]
Chandler police said that up was being treated as a homicide and a man was being held by police for questioning

[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.660]
Stinson 25 made his major league debut the season played 37 games for the reds and now

[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.940]
He's dead he was 25

[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:08.980]
Even worse on the stories that period he had been run over by the vehicle witnesses told police a black SUV was seen leaving the area

[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:15.200]
And he was also dragged along I guess these shot him and killed him in random over in the kind of dragged him along a little while just I guess to make sure

[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:22.100]
A bit Italian huh must have been Italian is that the way they do it? Yeah, they shoot you then they insult you somehow

[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:28.420]
Oh and speaking of John Ascroft well, I'm sure we got a lot of color that everybody calling and I'll say but that was really a horrible yesterday

[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:32.920]
And you'll don't ever do that again and don't read either here's for a lot of day. Hello

[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:42.320]
Yes, I have one for your bowl. Please sir the Dixie chicks are the biggest dueling Yahoo's oh man big time. Okay

[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.140]
Yes, I wouldn't be solved as footage

[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.620]
From a rock of those people getting thrown off the buildings and

[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.180]
Broken, etc. Yes, uh-huh. Do you

[00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:02.700]
Could do that further justification for going in there and removing that absolutely not huh? Let me ask you this. Do you remember the shot of Iran?

[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.560]
Pardon me. Do you remember the shot of Iran? Yeah, who put him in Iran? Who's who's a flunky was he?

[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.860]
Well, right. I you know understand when you come in from with that but after who's saying?

[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.060]
Gas the million of his own people

[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.920]
Where let me ask you this let me ask you weren't we doing business with them then?

[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.820]
No, I understand that we

[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:25.460]
Listen, we don't we don't don't give me this song today and so try to do what you're trying to see as well

[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.920]
He said that this he just we know where this guy was coming from. You're trying to justify the unjustifiable

[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:34.400]
There are lots of brutal dictators most of whom we support by the way and many of whom we have to put in their

[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:41.120]
First place like Salvador and they for example in Chile and finish it you know, we didn't like one so we put in the other one and

[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.540]
All over and baby doc and pop a doc and

[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.180]
Pop a mom out and what's up doc right?

[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.920]
We do it all the time. We've done it all over the freaking world

[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.680]
And this guy's giving me a song and it's about well didn't know it didn't those tapes it wasn't that for the justification of course not

[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.580]
the Savak that was the

[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:07.460]
There was the secret police from the shaw ver man. They used to pull out people's fingernails was one the way they used to torture them

[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.960]
Oh, they've got to pull out their fingernails. They'd yank him

[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.320]
He was our guy sure if it's our dictator our brutal reprint

[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.380]
It's just like that thing I read this guy didn't hear anything I read yesterday from Michael Moore talk about the Taliban

[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:26.460]
He won't we love the Taliban right they were our folks man. They were our business partner. They were the partners about all over Africa

[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.560]
But I brought in that kind of stand that's correct

[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.700]
But as soon as the things went sour then all of a sudden well

[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.540]
They did this and they did that in their barbaric and they repressed the women and they came listen to music

[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:41.300]
And they got to shave their beard so long and they're bad guys, you know and some of you people fall for this bull crap

[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.880]
Don't be that stupid

[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:48.680]
Don't be that ignorant of course this guy is like I said Suzy star with a Dixie chick so you understand why did oh head

[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.800]
Don't even put that on. They're not july yahu

Oh speaking of hiding in the closet here was a fact there were a couple of

[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.380]
Facts as came in the estate and have time to uh mention

[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.500]

Try to imagine Paul Lin with Marilyn Monroe what a hoot

[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.860]
Actually facts what a hoot

[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:49.060]
Er

[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:53.380]
It was a really a good column very disturbing we don't want to disturb anybody robert

[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:54.620]
No share how many body bags

[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:58.360]
I think we added on a website yesterday from the early times

[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.440]
I'm gonna read it right now because I feel like it i'm in a mood

[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:06.040]
On Sunday 19 more young americans died in a rack serving the vanity of an american president who will

[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.100]
Fully be trade them and who has no idea where his policies are taken to country

[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:12.860]
This is a president who has his now amply clear has systematically

[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.600]
Lotted the troops in the nation about the reasons for going to war

[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:20.260]
Distorting evidence to claim that the united states was threatened by satan who say his weapons of mass destruction

[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.940]
And linking erected the 9-11 terrorist attacks

[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:27.200]
Having led the country by the nose into a clumsy ill advised middle east power grab

[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.120]
President Bush has faced with a terrible quandary. What do we do now?

[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.140]
The first thing is to resist the logic of the self-fulfilling prophecy

[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.860]
Bush blender rack was a center of international terrorism

[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:42.000]
It wasn't and now says that because terrorists are coming over raki borders to take potshots at americans

[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.120]
We need to stay and fight them

[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.060]
We won't run Bush said cavalierly dismissing the lives of the young soldiers mirrored in his folly

[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:54.860]
This amounts to using our young men and women as bait and assumes there are a finite number of fanatics who can be dispensed with once and for all

[00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:02.240]
In fact the US occupation of the historic center of the Arab world is provided al-Qaeda another like-minded groups with their most effective recruiting poster yet

[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.800]
And we're fighting them on their terms and on their turf

[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:11.060]
Meanwhile attacks are coming from various Iraqi quarters those who enjoyed favors under Hussein

[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:17.440]
And those who may have been glad to see the US overthrow the tyrant but have since become alienated by an occupation that inevitably inspires nationalist

[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.200]
As well as religious opposition

[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:23.600]
Why can't we learn from our history and Vietnam in the experiences of the French and Algeria

[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:28.260]
And the Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza that no occupation by an army of the other is ever welcome

[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:35.840]
Only last week israel's army chief of staff issue to warning on the limits of an occupying power to achieve its goals to the exercise of military force

[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:43.700]
It increases hatred for israel and strengthens the terror organizations lieutenant general Moshe yalon told israeli reporters adding in our

[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:47.100]
Tactical interest were operating contrary to our strategic interests

[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:52.240]
Some pundits in politicians even those who may have been skeptical about the word to begin with now

[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:57.480]
I argue that we must finish the job even if it means increasing our commitment of troops or ruling Iraq indefinitely

[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:07.220]
This is however exactly the kind of stubborn and mushy thinking that let us into the hell of Vietnam more and the deaths of 58,000 Americans and more than two million Vietnamese and Cambodians

[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:13.980]
The occupation of Iraq is not working and will not work for Iraqis our culture is offensive and our tactics having handed

[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.640]
As none other than the American sponsored Iraqi politician off my chalabi put it after the latest world attacks

[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:25.500]
The Americans their methods their operations and their procedures are singularly unsuited to deal with this kind of problem

[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.740]
And US intentions in Iraq are far from clear though

[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.840]
There may be an echo of white man's burden that seeks to export civilization

[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:40.900]
Even that highly questionable goal is clouded and undermined by the fact that Washington inevitably will put a higher priority on having a new Iraq serve the US superpowers needs

[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:45.160]
Oil commerce military power rather than meet the needs of regular Iraqis

[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:51.260]
Unless we are willing to trade the lives of US troops and Iraqis for the obsessions of empire. We must end the occupation now

[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:56.480]
The US can give chalabi and the crowd the money they need to operate in the short run and similarly aid the more established

[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.200]
Shi'i groups

[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:04.300]
It can beg the UN Security Council to take over this mess with financial support from the US and smooth the transfer of power enough to let the president

[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.140]
Say faced by declaring the mission of victory

[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.220]
Such a wise reversal of course might even help push get reelected

[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.860]
His pull numbers on Iraq are sinking

[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.400]
If he can back off from the edge of the cliff to which his hyperaggressive foreign policy has taken us

[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.880]
The public might be conned into giving him another term

[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.800]
Personally, I think the president should be impeached for his lies

[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:26.640]
But more important he should redeem himself by coming to his senses and ending the carnage in instability

[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:32.060]
He is brought in Iraq and the world great column is usually by Robert sheer in the LA times on November 4 on

[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.800]
Good one

[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.400]
And I apologize for reading because obviously a lot of people out there who'd rather

[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.500]
Who wouldn't like that?

[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:45.720]
5670560 pound 56 did we need some more names on this list this poll today could have gone over to have no names

[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:52.060]
Here's a lady in Miami. Hello hi, Neil. Thanks for yesterday that made my hair stand on in

[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.100]
What you what you read?

[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.960]
It was horrifying and upsetting

[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:04.820]
I suspected it but it was it was actually worse than what I suspected about bush and his cronies

[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:10.380]
You know, I'd like to see you know, I'd like to see if I'd like to see him head up an army the way they did an ancient Rome

[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.760]
And see how much of a man he is then

[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.700]
Yeah, you know

[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.860]
And saying oh yeah, we've got to see it through you know

[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.780]
Let's see him step in front of the army and see how far he sees it through

[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:25.360]
Okay, but maybe help to his military service will be this was the first time

[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.020]
He has this vanishing cream. You know, he just keeps disappearing

[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.180]
5670560 pound 56 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:37.780]
Here's a call from Weston. Hello. How you doing, Neil? Okay, sir

[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:42.300]
I want to thank you for playing that yesterday. I called the plan and we're both listening and then

[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.600]
We know it all along about this stuff

[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:50.800]
And also I want to give her her that a big daddy bush was a drug smuggler in his early days

[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.920]
He had a company in Houston where he had pull where his ships never got checked for nothing

[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.240]
I'll be damned sounds like a candy bootleggers to me all over again

[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:04.400]
Yeah, I have it you take it me too you take it to have a

[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:05.340]
Tampa

[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:12.660]
5670560 this is I'm telling you man. I don't know why I do this. I have no idea why I do it

[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.500]
It says just let it go just pretended yesterday never happened on this show. It was just an aberration

[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.960]
Was just one of those things, you know, I mean

[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:23.460]
5670 is lying. Whatever gonna get fixed. Are we just giving up on that is the

[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:28.420]
We're gonna get what they open to ticket. Oh open a ticket my ass. Okay

[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:34.300]
Open the ticket. It's an inside the building thing. It's not subbell south which I know you love to bash them

[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.260]
But then I don't believe that's their problem. It's an inside the building thing

[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.440]
Because I saw when the hell that happened it was like right in the middle of a show like right in the middle of what I'm not like that

[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.200]
And it just just died

[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:53.580]
Here's a call from Miami. Hello. Hey Neil. How you doing pretty good? I just want to first start by telling you

[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:57.380]
I happen to leave a birthday to you. Thanks and now the business guy

[00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.780]
I myself am a service member. You know, I've been in the

[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:07.100]
In military for well over my retirement point and I tell why everybody tell everybody that I'm gonna be getting out

[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:10.320]
I'll be getting out simply because they call me crazy. They call me stupid

[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.800]
I'm not gonna throw so many years away and I have a sip. Where's her for them? I value my life

[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.800]
There you go. Very simple. I'm not gonna I my I value my life more than

[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:26.260]
More than money more than anything. I mean granted. I've served my country and but with an ass or like

[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.060]
Our commander in chief

[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:33.500]
He could keep it and like the lady just said why don't we put him in front of the firing squad? It's the all-on-last there

[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.420]
I love you baby take care and I'll

[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:40.500]
Much kisses. Good choice. Okay. Thank you. By the way, speak out of that would you us bring back the draft?

[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.680]
This was in Toronto star yesterday was on our website of Eggert Pardon

[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:49.480]
I've been here about that a call from the US Defense Department for volunteers to sit on local draft boards

[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:55.660]
Has sparked debate about whether a nationwide military draft could ultimately be needed to complete Washington's mission in Iraq whatever the hell that is

[00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:02.840]
A number of analysts said on Tuesday that while any public suggestion of a draft would be politically suicidal for a bush and an election year

[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:08.620]
He could fight himself with the other options if he's returned for a second term and the fighting in Iraq is still going on

[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.000]
Bush during fire ravaged regions of California Tuesday again

[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.180]
Vah the troops will never cut and run in Iraq even as attacks on Americans escalate

[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.920]
As debates rules about the kid release of the beleaguered US military the Pentagon's going for volunteers to serve your community and the nation

[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:33.160]
People but you know we make fun of people who are like suicide bombers right and what barbaric lunatics they must be well

[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.560]
What's the difference right?

[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:41.080]
It's a selective service system wants to hear from men and women in the community who might be willing to serve as members of a local draft board

[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:49.220]
If conscription becomes necessary it says 2000 local and appealed board would need volunteers the boards would decide who would go to war and who could

[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:53.680]
Defur their service in the event of a national call up to boost the currently off-holunteer military

[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:58.100]
This is significant said then the LeVoa presidential scholar at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire

[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:05.880]
What the Department of Defense is doing is creating the infrastructure to make the draft a viable option for the administration wish to go this route

[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.860]
He said it's the first public call to be constituted draft board since the compulsory draft was abolished in 1973 and

[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.740]
Amazingly shockingly Pentagon officials did not return calls for comment yesterday

[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:25.120]
What a shock who do they their mom their mom on the subject and by the way say hi to mom

[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:30.580]
Well thanks to Cindy who fast yesterday said happy birthday. No, thank you Cindy she and four five others had you know

[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:35.500]
Because we weren't taking the calls that would have been easy, but it took a little bit effort to send to facts. Thanks Cindy. That was nice

[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:37.040]
She made the effort

[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.900]
77 votes on our redneck. I mean on our drool in Yahoo poll

[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.540]
We only have three choices on air might just stay that way all day

[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.940]
Maybe we just can't top those three you know it maybe

[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.600]
How about that Lindsey Graham you know there's a drooling redneck hope

[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.740]
Lindsey Graham you ever seen him

[00:44:54.780 --> 00:45:03.740]
Oh, who is the biggest drooling Yahoo of them all 79 votes Jesse hums 36throm 3rd and 30 and Toby Keith only 13 only 13 for Toby

[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:08.800]
But he won all those country music awards last night. Yeah, but so did Johnny Cash and look how he's doing

[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:12.640]
For 305

[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:24.400]
I'm still on the charts

[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.600]
Still having kids

[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:34.620]
And I'm still making money baby

[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:47.100]
Like

[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:47.420]
we

[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:49.420]
I

[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:51.160]
I passed away

[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:57.540]
Though I've been dead forever

[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.780]
I'm still doing fine

[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.900]
I'm still doing fine

[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.600]
Just as forms my goals seem

[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.000]
I'm doing fine

[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:13.140]
Though I am on my grave

[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:17.040]
I'll play my song at rings

[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:24.120]
And if that ain't weird, I don't know what is

[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.260]
If I were dead

[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.260]
I'd be in the red

[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:40.260]
Going toes up is good for business

[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.760]
Beating the ground forever

[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.860]
But I'm doing fine

[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.700]
This is doing fine

[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:54.980]
Though I have left the building

[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.760]
I'm still doing fine

[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.760]
I'm still on the charts

[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.760]
Still having here

[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.600]
Love it or two this is one of the most beautiful things we've had on our website

[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:12.060]
And quite a while the WMD countdown I just noticed that

[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:18.300]
You must click on the picture and get the big the full deal here

[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:23.160]
And I just noticed I finally figured out why the president is his dumb as he is he's an orangutan

[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.600]
Because if Scott would look at that picture you know precious on passions the orangutan

[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:34.740]
The lips are exactly the same you see that you see the lips he can't see it I can't see it

[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:41.200]
And he said read my lips and W says look at these lips and if the orangutan they sure are precious

[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:48.720]
The WMD countdown it now says we've been digging now for 220 days 11 hours 0 minutes and 52 seconds

[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.820]
And ain't found nothing but oil yet darn it

[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.900]
That's a beautiful thing

[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.360]
Oh the lip that's definitely precious he's kin to precious

[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.900]
It's precious, don't think about it

[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:07.180]
We've been digging now for 229 days 11 hours no minutes and 52 seconds ain't found nothing but oil yet darn it

[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:07.940]
Nice go on W

[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.500]
In fact you know something

[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:14.760]
We're looking for names for the poll what that was wrong with me

[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.140]
Start taking

[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:19.080]
He's looking us in the push right there George W

[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:19.720]
Yeah

[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:20.480]
Get him on there

[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.160]
A Texan

[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:26.260]
Here's a good one from Marty and Miami who says how about David Duke for your poll

[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:28.300]
Okay

[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.640]
I'll be honest with you that David Duke doesn't talk like that though see he doesn't know

[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:35.620]
See he says by the way these banana voters we don't get this poll that's a reason for lack of opinions

[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:40.200]
Yeah Marty I hate to break the news you remember one most of our audience are banana voters the number two you don't get it

[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:46.240]
Because David Duke even though he's a southern redneck racist he just he don't talk like he's not a julien jehoo

[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.940]
Yes, fix don't know nothing about rednecks

[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.420]
Until they look in the mirror

[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:57.000]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a yes so let's get George W Bush on the poll

[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.900]
That'll go sub that number real quick

[00:48:58.900 --> 00:48:59.960]
Oh they love it

[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:04.920]
Some stiff competition Toby keep that shout out as did the Dixie Chicks of the Accompanied Music Awards

[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:09.220]
And I guarantee you what I said before is true that whole country music

[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:16.800]
Mafia the whole thing there's there's like a genetic defects is what there is there like a couple of genes missing

[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.680]
Here's a call from Miami hello

[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.560]
Hello

[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.000]
Yes sir

[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:30.720]
Yes, I heard the the audio you play just in the radio actually I went on the web and I got the transcript it's about 40 pages worth

[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:30.960]
Right

[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:36.600]
If I have a lot of people are interested in you know hearing more if anyone getting hold of the audio

[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:41.020]
You can't get it on there on the website

[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:47.400]
No I couldn't find anything on the audio it says you have a cassette or anything I get you know purchased from you or anything

[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:47.800]
No

[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:50.580]
Okay any suggestions

[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:56.760]
There's a lot of people that you know first part of it but they didn't hear the whole thing and they wanted to hear it all

[00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:01.540]
Any suggestions George we could probably like dovetin and the charge ten bucks a pop raise some money for cheer and a

[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:06.120]
Don't we still have archives going on won't that show be archives so that they can listen to it over and over again

[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:10.360]
Oh that's right that you'll be any archives you can listen to it on the oranges that come on our website that's correct

[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.260]

[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.060]
Right the audio will be on your website too

[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:16.720]
Sure

[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.300]
Okay so just because I looked on your website yesterday wasn't on there

[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:25.500]
No but you're not looking in the archives though see you have to look in the archives for while yesterday's show for the date November 5

[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:31.740]
Oh okay I'll do that then because a lot of people actually you could probably do it on cassette and then raise some money for the charity probably

[00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:35.500]
So I'm going to think about it I'll be able to say what I want to come down thanks a lot Pellie

[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.060]
All right bye

[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:43.840]
Here's one from Sergio who says happy related B day for the pool how about many of the girl boys from NASCAR like maybe Dick Trickle

[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:49.520]
Well see I don't know we'd probably have to have Joe Costello to like and of course he'd take a section of that because he insisted

[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:55.860]
NASCAR isn't a red neck you think you know try to red neck thing of course it is it's a red neck thing

[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:59.920]
It's much a red neck's going round and around every time that one gets killed

[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:04.220]
Wasn't there one of them killed here a couple of weeks ago and so test run or something

[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:05.380]
I don't know I lose count

[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:10.100]
Where the hell they call that crap goes round and around and around red neck you think

[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:14.000]
I mean red neck's are entitled to do their own thing you know they always got their thing

[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:21.500]
But it's just I don't know Dick Trickle you know I've seen it but I don't know it I don't know either

[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:25.840]
So somebody were calling with some country with I mean with well some country West people

[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:32.080]

[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:17.680]
When the atom is played it causes nuclear fission yeah this is what we have here is a failure to get an education

[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:23.220]
What we have up here is a failure to ever keep his ass off this show

[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:29.500]
Let's see I said oh this is good says that's supposed you could include 90% of all players but John rocker beats him off

[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:39.680]
John rocker there's a jewel in Yahoo right you move here's a chronic fan who faxes and says so much for playing that TV show yesterday morning

[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:46.760]
Right at the juiciest bin Laden bush moments I was parked at a gas pump on the other side of a pump was an older guy with a jet bumper sticker

[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.560]
One of those stupid bald eagle American flag stickers on his windshield

[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:54.380]
I just sat there in my car where he stood and pumped and gradually raised the volume to deafening proportions

[00:52:55.120 --> 00:53:02.900]
Thank you for that moment that's great and the facts about away is still alive but there it is survived he's still alive

[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:09.520]
Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.660]
Who is the biggest drooling Yahoo of them all?

[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:15.020]
Soon there were new democracies in Latin America

[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:21.880]
108 votes 43 for Jesse Helms 42 for stromthurman 17 for Toby Keith

[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:26.100]
And George W. Bush who's named just appeared on theirs already got six like magic

[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:31.700]
He's zoomed up the charts you watch you mark my words man he's gonna be a hit a smash on our poll today

[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.920]
Here's a call from Pompollo hello

[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.580]
Hello Mr. Rogers a boy with a birthday to you sir

[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:42.120]
Thank you and I wanted to thank you for yesterday's audio on that that was absolutely outstanding

[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:50.260]
And it needs to be replayed again over again I agree with the other guy if you double it onto a cassette or another something that would be worth donations for sure

[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:54.320]
For a charity cause more people need to hear what that was what was played yesterday

[00:53:55.460 --> 00:54:00.500]
And you saw my thunder on George W. Bush being on the list so that's what all I got is that

[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:04.200]
I'm in fact he's drooling right now mocking on TV he's drooling a little bit out the quarter of his lip

[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:09.500]
And I'm one of the people Mr. Rogers does not want to see you retire I'd like to hear you on the road on the airway forever

[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:39.480]
Because you're the only central that's a little person out there. Thanks. Thank you for all your contributions you do you really do well. Thanks, pal

[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:50.500]
I'm sorry to interrupt we try to like give you a few laughs we try to let you know what's going on in the world we try to give you some information like yesterday that you won't find any play well you will find it but most people don't have the time or the inclination to look for it to read to do these things

[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:57.220]
So all of these things and it's not easy to find a balance because no matter what it is you're doing you're going to piss off somebody some time

[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:11.620]
But I will say this it sure is hell better than put on a bunch of boring guests on talk radio I learned that a long time ago because what I used to do for many many years was put a bunch of boring guests on my talk shows and they were boring in the average age of my list there was 100 plus death

[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:18.100]
Infinity why never knew you work for infinity no I sure would like to though

[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:40.100]
What does this say Canadian skipping stones or yeah I had this story days ago that you just fact me about the you know I'll Canadians forget that's not the point that's not the point the fact is the rolling stones have come up with a new for this DVD and they're like marketing only and there's selling it and best buying one other joint and the rest of the major major music and music change today screw you we're not going to sell it

[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:56.380]
Canadians forget pretty easily well the screw that how would that just because they came here and done a concert does that mean that they're going to screw over all the other record stores the hell with it if I'm over there at HMV I say this to you Mick you idiot you sorry sorry old the piece of crap you old fag

[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:09.620]
Here's a call from poppin O hello yeah, I know you're sir happy birthday thanks and I got an addition to your list getting away from the political arena can we Bradshaw I think is the biggest you in Yahoo

[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:20.480]
Oh man you know who else just inspired me Terry Bowden oh yeah there's another oh Terry Bowden could be the big he could be the winner he is just on that

[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:37.380]
I don't know either one you can't go wrong with okay thanks a lot of Kelly I want to ask you something yes I was watching you know the thing about the apostle birth abortion yesterday that's you know passed and the sign into law I mean think about it you know I'm a bill that's voted on by predominantly male legislators

[00:56:37.380 --> 00:57:07.360]
sign into law by male executives that a law that's now is basically going to dominate women and their bodies for God knows how long I mean think about it most women you'll notice that his signature wasn't even dry on the bill and then the judge in a brass can said not so fast the good black enforcement of it a lot of local municipalities are going to fight and send these should but I mean the thing about it is you know most women they go for abortion they go for it real early women who opt for abortion after the first five measures because they find out that it's not a good thing to do it

[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:21.460]
if they count pregnancy you know to full term they're invading their health and they're making no exception for this if a woman's life is on the life too bad we're not going to give you this apostle you're not going to be able to have this procedure that's that compassionate conservative

[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:36.160]
any woman could vote for this man next year is beyond me really that's what I thought the first time well now I mean if this guy didn't sign his own death warrant with that was signing that that bill in the law yesterday I don't know what's going to do it

[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:52.100]

[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:44.420]
1119 at 560 WQM Steve Spurrier A.M.N. former Gators coach not coaching so to speak for the Washington Redskins

[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:58.480]
Denver fan happy right sure what I need a good guy who is the Denver fan of Willie Nelson the Denver fan

[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:03.060]
bush science ban on late term abortion president bush hot legislation Wednesday banning a certain type of abortion

[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:06.480]
and encourages the encounter of the individual with God

[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:15.260]
handing a the disputed procedures opponents a long sought victory even as a federal judge at least partially blocked the new law from taking effect was he talking about

[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:16.440]
oh god again

[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:23.220]
but less than an hour after bush put his pen to paper a federal judge in Nebraska sharply questioned the law's constitutionality

[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:28.440]
and you should a limited temporary restraining order against it U.S. District Judge Richard comp said it was concern that the

[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:34.460]
ban contains no exception if the woman's health is at risk and you should an injection applied only to the four doctors who brought the suit

[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:42.100]
while it's also true that Congress found that a health exception is not needed it is at the very least problematic whether I should defer to such a conclusion

[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.920]
when the Supreme Court has found otherwise cops said

[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:51.380]
beside Nebraska hearings were taking place in San Francisco and New York on similar challenges and will take place all over the country

[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.780]
fully aware of the impending legal obstacles bush said rights

[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.040]
and are denied schooling

[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:04.340]
what was said away standing ovation and longest round of applause during his brief remarks the executive branch will vigorously defend this law

[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:06.840]
against any who would try to overturn in the courts

[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:11.060]
I guess the feeling that like they want to do is like to drive it all the way back up to the Supreme Court again

[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:12.000]
it will

[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:19.020]
and even though they've declined to revisit Roe v. Wade a couple of times maybe this time maybe the fixes in already in

[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.120]
clearance be token maybe they got clearance and really good stuff

[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.180]
and maybe they let him look up uh huh need a hills dress one more time

[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.440]
and San Diego Conner as well who now would want to look up San

[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.880]
Diego Conner's dress Jesus that would be like he helps ruins

[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:34.580]
uh address man oh man can you imagine what's crawling around up there

far back that i actually could have liked that because it's just been you've just been brutal

[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:50.240]
it'd be even beaten over the head with it like somebody took a righteous brother cd and just

[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:54.520]

Him goes when two fish are free

[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:54.620]
He should be committed by this week

[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:00.240]
I think Rocker's mental, his brain is a rental

[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:03.940]
Maybe he took it from Manson

[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.300]
He should keep his trash out

[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:09.620]
Or he may give his throat cut

[01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:13.660]
He'll be around as long as Manson

[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.620]
He's a redneck, needs a brain check

[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:22.500]
He's a big round, living out sound

[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:26.320]
And gold, sweet, cheap, and jelly-free

[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:31.920]
He should be committed by this week

[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:34.680]
Got Rocker's got six votes, he's moving up the ladder

[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:36.600]
I can't believe Terry Bowden's holding out a pair

[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.620]
You know what a real teeny tiny pair like ball bearings

[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:39.860]
He's only got two votes

[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:40.380]
Who?

[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.000]
Terry Bowden

[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.080]
Oh listen, I mean we got some sports nerds out there

[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.360]
And this crowd, they know who that is

[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.300]
It's just, there's nobody even close

[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:52.120]
Even W is like a great, the big city slicker by comparison

[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:53.520]
Keep slick

[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.440]
The National Endowment for Democracy is promoting women's rights

[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:57.880]
And training Iraqi journalists

[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.640]
Oh this is good right?

[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.000]
And he heals the sun and that bill yesterday

[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.960]
He's talking about women's rights

[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:01.700]
Nice going W

[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.380]
No wonder he's leaving the pack

[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.480]
Who's the biggest drooling Yahoo of them all

[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:06.880]
His or was, dead or alive

[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:10.500]
George W. Bush 74, Jesse Hums 56, Ram Thurman 56

[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.320]
As in Q 56

[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.180]
Toby Keith 21

[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:17.260]
You notice how Hank in Atlanta and that spot he did during that last break

[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:18.440]
Spelled off Fury

[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.160]
Oh, that he are our wise and Danny Fury is opposed to

[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:28.540]
Toby Keith 21, Dr. Filma Groh 13, a real jueling Texas Yahoo Fony

[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:32.220]
John Rocker 6, Terry Bradshaw 5, Terry Bowden's only got two

[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.660]
I wish I could vote a thousand times for Terry Bowden

[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:37.920]
He is the definitive, he makes the kid that was sitting in the tree

[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.400]
That Beasley family member in the tree with a banjo and deliverance

[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.440]
He makes him seem like John D. Rockefeller

[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.940]
Willie Nelson's got two and Steve Spurrier's got one y'all to see it

[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:48.020]
It's like purple in the green

[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.140]
Now this facet is sent me

[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:52.300]
Keep a scan fisherman

[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.280]
Oh, speaking of the fisherman, how's he doing?

[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.660]
The fisherman maybe he's still in the closet with Aelion

[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:02.920]
Dear Mr. Neil Roger Schoetz, this must be from Reverend Jones

[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.220]
I think even the Faxes now are starting to be from Reverend Jones

[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:09.160]
It says I hope you'll consider giving this same poll a twist one day

[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.500]
Instead of drooling Yahoo

[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:15.140]
Slow-bring it's slavering with one B, slow-bring spick with a K

[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.760]
We'll have a field day without one starting with Rick Snatches

[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:20.440]
Have a nice day to keep his scan fisherman

[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:24.160]
Slow-bring spick, well how many slavering spicks do we know George?

[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.560]
I guess he'd like to put you on the poll probably in Rick Sanchez

[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.460]
In Aelion, I don't know if I forgot

[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:29.320]
Maybe a lot of it

[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.120]
There are quite a few when you come right down to it

[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.180]
There's Rousa Sanchez, what else is there?

[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.400]
Rousa Rousa Rousa, let's figure out what his name is today

[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.320]
Whether he's Cuban or Jewish

[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.140]
Right, what are yours?

[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.780]
Ramon, Saul, Sidor...

[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.020]
He's yours

[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.420]
No, in a hell of a year, no he's gay

[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.140]
You take him, yeah

[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:48.960]
And well I'll take it under consideration

[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.660]
Okay, we have done the uh, see what the Jews we didn't say

[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.540]
Well who's the most obnoxious Jew of them all?

[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.480]
I would have invaded, you know

[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.760]
So we did like who's the best biggest walking afferent he's Semitism

[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.340]
What a jury sign fell down there in the Nanny people like that

[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.800]
So today we're just picking on drooling Yahoo's

[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.400]
Which I enjoy picking on drooling Yahoo's

[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.700]
They're generally speaking dumb and dangerous

[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:07.720]
They're just really...

[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:08.780]
They're spelled both of them

[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:09.860]
Yeah, they've doubled these

[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:11.560]
dumb and dangerous

[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.240]
Here's the call from Hollywood, hello

[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.740]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:17.380]
Pretty good

[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:18.700]
Happy birthday to you

[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:19.240]
Thank you

[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.080]
I like to give one to the Poles and I got an extra important question

[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:23.480]
Okay

[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:24.160]
Yes

[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.160]
For the Poles, Jerry Jones

[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.760]
Oh yeah, somebody did you send the facts?

[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.220]
The Dallas Cowboy owner, I mean

[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:33.440]
He's a typical Yahoo's

[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:36.640]
Somebody just passed it and also Jerry Jones, let's get to my get him on there

[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:37.200]
He's an idiot

[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:41.860]
And the question is, my brother, Moll and Chester just bought a trailer right

[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:43.140]
For our investment reason

[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:43.940]
Yeah

[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:47.180]
And the man who lived in it was 97 years old

[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:49.060]
He passed away, his family was up Michigan

[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.720]
And he didn't want nothing to do with it

[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.240]
So he got the trailer real cheap

[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.020]
So he called me over this weekend

[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:56.940]
And we were going through all this junk throwing at all this stuff in there

[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:58.700]
And it caused it

[01:14:58.700 --> 01:14:59.840]
I'm asking you this question

[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.860]
That'll trust these Yahoo sports guys

[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:03.460]
You got a new radio station, okay

[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.320]
I found the baseball bat

[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:06.520]
And it's an old stuff

[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.980]
And it's got George Bay Roost signature on it

[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:09.240]
Wow

[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.860]
I want to know if you know where I can call a place

[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:13.620]
Or a website I can go to to check the old

[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:14.640]
Send us all

[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.100]
You know, TFF signatures real

[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:18.980]
And how much does that need work

[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.180]
That's a good question

[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:22.840]
Because I would say

[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.300]
You know, look under collectibles

[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:26.040]
Like an yellow pages under collectibles stores

[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:26.960]
A baseball cartridge

[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:27.880]
He doesn't go to a library

[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:28.820]
Do you think they're going to work?

[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.340]
No, that was just going to say

[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:31.560]
The only problem with that is

[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.640]
Is that you know, if you don't find somebody reputable

[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.420]
They can say, oh, that's worth about 20 bucks

[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:36.860]
And sell us for 20 grand

[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:38.140]
Oh, I know it's worth more than that

[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:39.260]
I mean, I'm not stupid, you know

[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:41.300]
I mean, someone can put it on eBay

[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:44.040]
Well, let's see if somebody call in and let us know

[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:44.900]
Because I don't want to guess

[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.900]
Alright, I appreciate it

[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:48.460]
Hang on to a tight pal, thanks a lot

[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.020]
Oh, I will

[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:49.980]
Okay

[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:52.580]
Jerry Jones, out of their Dallas Cowboys

[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:54.380]
Who not only is a really joling Yahoo

[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:55.660]
But also very temperamental

[01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:58.140]
He's got kind of a Southern George Steinbrenner

[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.240]
Okay

[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:01.460]
Yeah, no, seriously

[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.080]
We're not quite that much money, I assume

[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.340]
Well, here's the schedule for next week

[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:06.000]
Look at all this stuff

[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:06.900]
I don't see anything

[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:09.140]
Oh, yeah, Jimmy's brother, Billy Carter

[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.260]
Would have been good to use to pee on his side of buildings all the time

[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:12.160]
I guess he used to pee

[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.420]
He was like an omchidon no matter where he was

[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:15.980]
He just whip it out and take a leak

[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:16.800]
No matter what the hell he was

[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:17.820]
And we had Billy Beer

[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:18.660]
Oh, we put that on

[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:20.180]
That's a good one, Billy Carter is excellent

[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.480]
I understand it

[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.280]
105 bucks to get to 30 in I-1000

[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.180]
For a band of parriscu, we got it yet

[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:32.420]
Yeah, I got it

[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.080]
See, well the reason being they don't want to bring the cash in

[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.080]
Because if they give it to Scott, they know that he'll spend it

[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:38.660]
They don't give it to Scott

[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:39.860]
They give it to you

[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:40.220]
Right

[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:41.860]
Like I said, they don't think they give it to you

[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.880]
No, I mean, that's just unacceptable

[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.200]
You know, you people in that building

[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.380]
I'm going to be there next week

[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:47.340]
And I don't think I'm going to talk

[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.920]
Aside, I won't talk to George because he won't be there

[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:50.900]
Right

[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:52.060]
We'll talk to Scott and I'll talk to

[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.500]
When I'm not going to talk to Farrell either

[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:54.980]
Because he hasn't given a dime yet, hasn't he?

[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.020]
Hasn't given a penny yet

[01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:57.480]
He'll pony up, I'm sure at some point

[01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:58.700]
Well, when the hell is that going to be?

[01:16:58.820 --> 01:16:59.600]
Well, we get our bonus checks

[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.280]
Now, I get out of here when you get your bonus checks

[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.420]
My fat ass

[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:07.740]
Christ, we got people in that place making more money than God

[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:10.260]
105 bucks

[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:12.760]
Parasite of being able to reach down into his pocket

[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:14.600]
Deep down in there, you won't find anything else

[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.100]
105 dollars, you ought to be able to come up with a 20

[01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:21.080]
I ought to be able to round that up in 15 minutes for Christ's sakes

[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:24.000]
There is, see the one thing in WQM, seriously

[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.500]
There is no spirit of cooperation

[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:27.100]
None

[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.360]
And I'm not just talking about

[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.600]
With this show or any other show with Mo

[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:32.240]
That it just doesn't exist

[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:32.800]
Right

[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.600]
Everybody is like an island unto itself

[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.520]
Well, if you would just cooperate with them

[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:39.140]
Scrum

[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.040]
Quot by doing what?

[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.180]
By talking more

[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:43.680]
Sports

[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.220]
No

[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:46.640]
Promoting here

[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:47.820]
Asking of the partial birth of Berson

[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.600]
Bill is just another in the endless series of blows

[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.660]
Disadministration is striking at our civil liberties

[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:53.800]
Oh, wait until you hear the story about the PPT Act

[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.220]
I got by the way about how they're using in Vegas against strippers

[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:57.500]
True story

[01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:01.560]
To establish their neo-fascist regimes as James in this fact

[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.760]
I defy anyone to explain how America's fetuses

[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.600]
Are more viable value important than living a raki children

[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.560]
And how about the American children that were sending over

[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.320]
The kids that are getting blown up every day

[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.160]
The sad fact is that in all likelihood

[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.480]
Will be stuck with Georgie Poo for another five years

[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.080]
As he won't have to run a primary campaign

[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:20.860]
And will start the presidential campaign with a tidy 200 million bucks in the bank

[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:24.680]
As we all know he outspent both coordinator combined in the 2000 election

[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.180]
And got the minority of the votes but now he's got his buddies rigging of voting machines

[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:29.560]
I long for the sweet

[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:32.060]
Oh, that's a great fine

[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.580]
Did you read this?

[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:36.220]
Yeah, it's great

[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:39.060]
I long for the sweet release of death

[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:40.740]
So that's James B

[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:42.840]
Don't do it James, you're a young man

[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.560]
You got your whole life ahead of you

[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.060]
Don't jump

[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:46.260]
I'll see you at the border

[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.700]
I'll be in the North

[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:52.760]
We are supporting the O-Fy-C-C-C-C-A-M

[01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:55.540]
Tut

[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:55.540]

[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.600]
Russiansves united within

[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.280]
Looks like he is from large in land

[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.320]
How did he get

[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:50.200]
Years like that

[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.740]
A handful of golden

[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:15.040]
Yeah, and now it's time to end this song.

[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:18.880]
Like it's going on too long.

[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:21.520]
We can skin-grab victims.

[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:22.740]
We can't even get a gun.

[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:22.740]

[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:22.740]

[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:22.740]

[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:23.980]
It's like that.

[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:31.560]
I look in here with his pimple head.

[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:36.140]
I'm from a boat full of rats and cranes.

[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:40.900]
Ooh, it's like that.

[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:49.360]
Ooh, it's like that.

[01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:57.940]
Ooh, it's like that.

[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.980]
Your brother, Ken and Toronto says what about Larry Flethe?

[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.300]
He is the consummate drooling y'all.

[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.100]
We didn't mean that kind of drooling, Ken.

[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.700]
Oh, that's bad.

[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.240]
Although you do have a good point.

[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.680]
Anyway, great article at Newsweek.

[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.220]
In fact, I just emailed it to Eric.

[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:19.680]
We'll have it on our website momentarily because it's more important.

[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.440]
I don't think they say Eric, I don't like to usually add on more stuff during the show.

[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:24.760]
Because I know you are very busy, like Don Corleone.

[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:29.980]
But Michael Issykov and Mark Hosenbahl lost opportunity.

[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.500]
Remember that story at the beginning of the show?

[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:32.700]
Hosenbahls.

[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:33.380]
We can't say that.

[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:34.940]
Hosenbahls.

[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:42.120]
On the eve of the invasion of a rack, defense officials were offered a secret back channel opportunity to talk peace with Sodom.

[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.280]
Remember that story from ABC News?

[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:43.520]
Yes.

[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:44.520]
Well, guess what?

[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:45.800]
Newsweek found out about it too.

[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:52.320]
Sources tell Newsweek that Investigators want to know if one house officials blew a chance to avoid an invasion of a rack.

[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:53.780]
Other than, wait till you're this.

[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:54.280]
Okay.

[01:21:54.720 --> 01:22:09.640]
Others see the meeting and others that took place overseas involving Pentagon officials as part of a secretive intelligence operation that was set up by administration hardliners within the defense department and functioned outside the boundaries of the U.S. Intelligence Committee and without congressional oversight.

[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:13.920]
It was a renegade operation, says one Democratic investigator.

[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.320]
We've been hearing a lot about that.

[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:17.460]
A lot of scuttle butt, a lot of rumblings.

[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:22.700]
So the whole story will be down there on our website from Newsweek as soon as Eric puts down lunch.

[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:24.960]
I'm going to save this.

[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:26.620]
I long for the sweet release of death.

[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:29.160]
That could be the greatest back of all time.

[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:30.960]
Man.

[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:33.600]
It's not that bad, James.

[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:34.740]
Well, you know, maybe it is.

[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:37.940]
Maybe it is where you are.

[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:38.660]
I'm not there yet.

[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:42.360]
So anyway, Ross Perot, who is my play that hobby has got to go in him.

[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.700]
Ross Perot, of course, absolutely, right?

[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:45.380]
Absolutely.

[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:46.860]
Jouling Yahya.

[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:58.800]
Here's another good one from our chronic faxagery and beneath the springs, which yes, I do have the story about John Ascroft and the paypudak, which I got here standing by momentarily, about how they're using it to bust strippers in Vegas from the paypudak.

[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:02.140]
It's just mind-boggling.

[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:05.560]
Anyway, Jerry says I'd like to make a suggestion for today's poll.

[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:06.260]
It's a very good one.

[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:09.420]
It's the right wing Democrat from Georgia, who thinks he's a Republican zeal.

[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:12.460]
Miller, I saw him drooling this weekend on there on all the talking in shows.

[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.780]
Jerry says, I'm beginning to think we don't stay the chance to November.

[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.040]
Don't keep your chin up, Jerry.

[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:19.600]
Don't throw into town. That's what they want us to do.

[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:22.120]
Vote 20, 30 times at least.

[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:27.020]
And then we might have a trinomins chance against those fixed voting machines, too, by the way.

[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:31.780]
Who is or was the biggest drooling Yahoo of them all?

[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.200]
Larry Flint's an excellent choice.

[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.060]
We're not going to put them on it.

[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:34.960]
It's some bad taste.

[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:45.220]
George W. Bush 102, Jesse Helm 61, Strom Thurman 57, Toby Keith 23, Dr. Phil.

[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:47.560]
Dr. Phil has got 20, man.

[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:49.020]
And he's moving up the list relentlessly.

[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:51.920]
John Rocker's six, Terry Bradshaw's six.

You know like Ray Perry go came through right who else right and Adam and sales

[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:13.580]
What about all the other sales people that are siphoning off from this goddamn show tons and tons and tons of cash

[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:19.240]
Every day when they sit down with their family at the dinner table and they lift the fork to that the goddamn mouth

[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:20.100]
They're forking us

[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:25.540]
That's right because it's our money that put that food on the table from this show

[01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:30.780]
It's the commission they're getting from a siphoning off on this show and what do we get back from them?

[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:34.420]
Not even at not even a good with of it

[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:41.180]
55 bucks is all we're sure to get us to 38 grand and then I'll dummy up for the rest of the day if we just

And you're right the people that are coming through for us

[01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:49.740]
And I'm I'm almost embarrassed to take their money because these people can't afford it

[01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:53.220]
But they still give a crap enough to try to help out. We should have a charity for them

[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:59.280]
That's right. They're right. We should be collecting money for the people that are helping us out most of them need it

[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:06.900]
It's always that way the ones who can afford for the most part they wouldn't give you the time of day for 50 cent

[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:12.100]

Joan inherited McDonald's all that money. Oh, you know, she just recently died. At least he was a philanthropist

Joan Croc she left $200 million the largest donation in the history of NPR National Public Radio

[02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:28.940]
The request from the widow of the founder of the McDonald's fast food chain both shocked and delighted people and NPR's headquarters in Washington yesterday

[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:33.360]
It wants to almost twice NPR's annual operating budget somebody once told us to Peter North

[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:36.440]

[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:11.880]

[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:17.080]
About 30 man. No tell me. I know you listen to what I've never heard it in my life. Oh Neil

[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:33.100]
Why would I want to hear NPR? Oh, it's riveting

[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:40.080]
Croc 75 that a brain cancer October 12th in San Diego. She'd been a long time listener of NPR's local affiliate KPBS

[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:43.540]
But had no formal association with NPR or the funding of it

[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:49.160]
People in NPR said she expressed admiration for their coverage of the events leading up to the war and reporting the word

[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:53.800]
So her gift NPR is one of several that flow from her estate last week the University and of course

[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:57.220]
The San Diego Padres

[02:01:57.220 --> 02:01:57.880]
Padres

[02:01:59.220 --> 02:02:02.760]
We're owned by Ray Croc and then she took it over and ran the team after he died

[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:07.860]
Last week the University of San Diego and the University of Notre Dame and oh no see

[02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:12.140]

50 million dollars to that anxious obnoxious

[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:18.080]
Disgusting organization

[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:21.500]
Screw you Regis

[02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:27.720]
In 1998 he gave 25 million to us D San Diego for establishment of the Joan P. Croc Institute for peace and justice

[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:33.080]
Now Notre Dame has a similar institution which was established in 86 with a long history of philanthropy

[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:37.240]
She donated to individual public radio stations in the past two hundred million dollars for NPR

[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:44.240]
From Joan Croc and now she's dead. Oh after the break I got into the AmeriOlephant the latest update. Oh good

Miami-Bee's

[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:40.660]
Years ago, Jenny didn't give him the key to the city and they didn't lick him the right way in the right place

[02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:44.040]
And then here not too long ago they had like issue of formal apology

[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:51.160]
So it was nothing at all the unrest of the you know the Oja Provocateur Goyama there because the Nelson freaking Mandela

[02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:54.780]

[02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:15.560]
These these chicken hawks they're running the goddamn show

[02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:19.840]
In case you hadn't figured it out yet Alfred E. Newman. He's just the face man

[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:23.140]
He's just the the connection to the God squad. That's all

[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:30.320]
Speaking of that black ministers fight to keep Miriam elephant is Broward elections chief

[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:31.280]
Can you believe this in?

[02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:37.200]
In a live radio broadcast it ran almost three hours some Broward County black preachers yesterday

[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:43.820]
stood firmly behind Miriam elephant chastised black politicians who withdrawn their support and found to use the power of the pulpit

[02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:46.760]
To keep the beleaguered election supervisor in orifice

[02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:51.060]
We still support Miriam elephant said the Reverend Eric Jones of

[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:56.280]
Coinonia worship center and Carver Ranges coignants the what coigno worship center

[02:08:57.480 --> 02:08:58.440]
Coinonia oh

[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:00.280]
Coinonia

[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:04.740]
In Carver Ranges who has the Southwest Guard ministers alliance

[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:06.580]
We try to stay away from the black and white issues

[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:11.380]
But it's hard not to play the race card when it's on the table. It's obvious to us. There's no reaction

[02:09:11.380 --> 02:09:13.420]
I hate to break the news to your Reverend Jones

[02:09:13.420 --> 02:09:13.800]
Ha

[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:18.380]
His name is Reverend Eric Jones

[02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:24.060]
And Reverend joy. Yeah, I hate to break the news to you, but there ain't no race god on the new whether it's called

[02:09:24.060 --> 02:09:29.160]
Non-Compass penis is what it's called okay Reverend. She's incompetent. She can't get the job done

[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:35.220]
Whether she's black brown white purple pink green your game. No, not that Reverend Jones

[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:42.580]
A day after a mailed in an election in which 17% of the ballot center of voters were returned as undeliverable

[02:09:43.220 --> 02:09:46.240]
Members of the Broward ministerial allowance and not alliance announced it

[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:51.580]
It would take to their pulpits immediately to urge their congregations throughout the governor and show support for elephant

[02:09:52.100 --> 02:09:56.160]
The meeting underscored a deepening riff between black preachers and black elected officials

[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:59.420]
The preachers man you put them together. They got a collective IQ about

[02:09:59.420 --> 02:10:07.420]
It may be Miriam today said bishop victor t curry host of the morning glory hole radio show on WMBM

[02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:13.780]
1490 which broadcasts from the bride ministerial alliance meeting at Ebenezer missionary Baptist Church and Helen Dale Beach

[02:10:14.380 --> 02:10:18.620]
You think Ebenezer scrooge has something to do with that Ebeneer and Ebenezer my ass

[02:10:19.260 --> 02:10:23.920]
It could be Christmas tomorrow or else he hastings tomorrow or Joe Eglity in next year said curry

[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:28.020]
Referring to the state house democratic leader the congressman and the broward county minister respectively

[02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:30.280]
We should have each other's backs

[02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:34.260]
We're not condoning wrong which has been cleared of ethics charges

[02:10:34.260 --> 02:10:38.380]
We're not talking about a criminal here. Tell we're just talking about somebody who's incompetent you idiot

[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:43.880]
On yesterday's broadcast elephant spent an hour discussing her plight and defending her office

[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:47.740]
The supervisor said that all her office was in adequately funded by the county commission

[02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:53.820]
She had run successful elections including Tuesday's mail-in since the mistake little gubernatorial primary September 2002

[02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:58.260]
I struggle with budget issues elephant said I have an adequate budget

[02:10:58.260 --> 02:11:02.080]
I've tried to work it out when in doubt work it out and seek assistance with the county commissioners

[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:05.400]
Where do I go from here is what my lawyers and I talk about

[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:09.620]
Reiterating her responses in a 10-page letter sent to governor jib bush on thursday

[02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:13.300]
She challenged the credibility of a severely critical report on her orifice

[02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:17.920]
Written by a state task force to report described the orifice in disarray

[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:22.820]
Lacking leadership and not undertaking tasks urgently needed to prepare for next year's voting

[02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:26.900]
Oh my god, I can just see the hang-and-chats all over again now in

[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:32.580]
Wow, God, I can see we're gonna have to get that judge down from Palm Beach the one with that diggy evil eye right

[02:11:32.580 --> 02:11:36.220]
He's looking up to the sky, you know google. I keep looking through that hole

[02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:43.060]
Man with political leaders including brown County commissioners calling for her removal

[02:11:43.060 --> 02:11:47.180]
Bush has given all of that until Monday to address the deficiencies or faces pension

[02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:53.040]
In her letter to the governor. She said the review was an effort to debate. What is it that every time you dark folks

[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:53.860]
You'd all bet out of shape

[02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:55.780]
It's got to be about another dark. He what is that all about?

[02:11:55.780 --> 02:12:03.520]
That's just like the old thing. Oh, we don't want to play the race card, but we will that whole thing there with a black power salute at the end of that trial

[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:07.940]
That was the one of the most disgusting. I'm not and you know this business about well payback is invention

[02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:08.760]
What what is that?

[02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:13.900]
What's right for the goose is right for the gander what's wrong for the goose is also wrong for the gander

[02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:22.260]

Finger-pointing hypocritical sack of crap, Newt Henry Hyde

[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:26.240]
Henry in his hide in that family he destroyed over there in western

[02:13:27.060 --> 02:13:34.340]
Then he broke up lie to the bitch and told her that oh well. I'm not married. I'm just a bomb. He bought the congressman who's prematurely white-haired

[02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:35.980]

They know it's going to be an endless list

[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:01.300]
Endless list and let me say it again

[02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:05.200]
The ones in the closet who are pointing their fingers the Newt Gingriches in the world

[02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:09.040]
The Bob Livingston's in the world the Henry trying to hide it of the world

These are the ones that have got that as skeletons of rattler-mond looks like a guy named it looks like a medical lab in their closet

[02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:27.660]
Huh, they do that there because like I said yesterday a U of M education is an oxymoron

[02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:32.200]
I thought it was just football and rape. I don't want to start in on that so-called diabetes expert there at the U of M

[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:36.840]
What he knows about diabetes you could stuff off it up his ass and have about 400 pounds of glucose left over

[02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:40.740]
He doesn't know anything about it and then they're responsible for killing me

[02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:44.000]

Over down the Broward County. They're going to do some sort of experiment

[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:23.740]
I thought you I thought you would think it would be pretty interesting to see if anybody speaks English

[02:15:23.740 --> 02:15:29.280]
to see if anybody speaks English in date County and then they're sending an American person over to

See they put Carville on there who you can't take seriously because he just he's a clown

[02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:37.420]
And then Paul Begalla who is so freaking weak. He's so lame. I figured what I was watching the other day

[02:20:37.420 --> 02:20:41.460]
But they had some some right wing runner who was saying the most outrageous ridiculous things

[02:20:41.460 --> 02:20:46.380]
And then the comeback was so obvious that my little dog who's been dead now for a long time

[02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:49.920]
He could have given the answer and he said maybe believe just let's him off the hook

[02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:53.700]
Because the only guy about 20 minutes in indola go to Schmidt can the show anyway

[02:20:54.260 --> 02:20:56.240]
Didn't know what you said Schmidt something like that

[02:20:56.760 --> 02:21:00.600]

[02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:05.560]

Is this nail sounds like Neil oh, okay

[02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:36.960]
Basically what I want to do is I want to tell you that you have a problem

[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:44.680]
Because in years past you've always had your stuff at borders or somewhere where just keep pedestrian for like myself

[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:46.760]
It's walk in right by you know

[02:22:47.540 --> 02:22:52.960]
I mean I found items every year right and this year there's nowhere to go get it

[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:58.600]
You're right. I'm on a telephone to get it and I don't have the internet so this isn't the this isn't the first year

[02:22:58.600 --> 02:23:01.480]
We've had that problem a QAM. We've had that this before

[02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:10.180]
Well, I'm the song that I've never never experienced not being able to get anything right and I'm finding myself in that position

[02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:16.120]
And I'm like hey, I mean I remember even seeing you at the color Ridge mall years ago

[02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:21.360]
That's right. I mean, I mean I actually shook your hand and took a picture with my wife. I mean

[02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:24.400]
And I thought it was great, you know, but the thing is like me

[02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:30.660]
You know, I'm a male guy. What the heck do I suppose to do? I mean, I'm not delivering six days a week in the freaking porn ring like today

[02:23:31.240 --> 02:23:35.400]
And I mean, you know, oh, you've got a thing at one o'clock. Well, hey, that's great

[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:39.820]
I understand it that's your very right. Well, don't we have a phone number that this gentleman can call?

[02:23:40.260 --> 02:23:41.840]
Oh, yes, yes, there is

[02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:45.040]
You never program that into the into the commercials or nothing

[02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:48.340]
Well, we're going to give it to you right now don't resist so hard. I realize it's

[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:51.880]
a bit of a day, but trying to help but trying to help you out so you can help us out

[02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:55.000]
Appreciate it. What's that number George 305?

[02:23:55.340 --> 02:24:00.000]
Uh-huh six five oh six five oh oh one five six

[02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:07.060]
Oh one five six you got it and the biggest y'all of all time junior samples from he-ha

[02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:13.820]
Okay, right junior samples from he-ha okay get him on here. How about junior sale?

[02:24:15.220 --> 02:24:20.800]
Junior samples of a long zunner and that number you see he's right that should be in the thing in the spot that we're playing

[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:26.020]
So that the station could actually accomplish something or doing something for us, but they don't want to be doing that

[02:24:26.020 --> 02:24:29.500]
So we got a hubbuck from clearance. We got 50 from Dave Hagen and his wife. Thank you Dave

[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:35.260]
He's a good guy just like Curtis. We got a few good people around here and we got some real assholes

[02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:38.080]
five six seven oh five sixty

[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:41.200]
five sixty on the 18th

[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:45.960]
Well, it's true. We got a lot of assholes in that place no matter where you work when you got a hundred two hundred people in a building

[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:49.380]
There's gonna be some very nice people. They're gonna be something. Yeah, you know, they're okay

[02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:51.500]
And then they're gonna be some assholes Greg

[02:24:52.780 --> 02:24:56.100]
I just mentioned that in passing screw in you know

[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:00.240]
Here's the call from Oakland Park hello

[02:25:00.780 --> 02:25:05.740]
First there is no color in our pasture and Scott will now be added to the law. Oh god

[02:25:07.460 --> 02:25:10.440]
Here's the call from Sunrise. Hello. How you doing Neil?

[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:11.400]
Okay, sir

[02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:17.680]
It reinforces every like

[02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:25.140]
Prejudice and even give some validity look the woman's grossly incompetent absolutely there is no debate

[02:25:25.140 --> 02:25:30.500]
There is absolutely no debate and if somebody is grossly incompetent at their job

[02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:32.960]
You should be able to remove them

[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:40.140]
It is correct part of the reason there's reluctance by some people to hire blacks or other minorities is that

[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:43.300]
If they get somebody who's incompetent forget about their color

[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:48.580]
They can't remove them if they're black without being accused of being a racist

[02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:51.320]
Absolutely sure that's a great point

[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:55.460]
There are a lot of people do a lot of being in that position of how you people blackmail their way into staying

[02:25:55.460 --> 02:26:00.340]
And I use that term blackmail literally into staying in a position that they're not competent to uh to do

[02:26:00.340 --> 02:26:05.920]
So it creates discrimination just reinforces the whole thing. It's it's terrible now to be fair

[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:13.040]
My my recollection and maybe it changed is that stupid bitch and Palm Beach county to reso whatever look who are yes

[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:16.760]
She kept her job after that screw up that's right

[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:21.060]
I can understand why some black people say if a woman like that keeps her job

[02:26:21.060 --> 02:26:26.960]
You know why are they going after Miriam? Well, I got I got a solution for that. Let's fire both their ass. How do you like that?

[02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:31.560]
We're on the same page obviously right. I don't think Jeb is gonna get rid of her

[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:35.480]
He warrants voters in brown county to be disenfranchised

[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:38.760]
I mean, it's it's the most liberal county in the state right

[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:44.340]
Can be implored up of course keep in mind. That's the place where they fixed it the last time and date and brown

[02:26:44.340 --> 02:26:51.600]
Exactly he wants turmoil he wants voters just enfranchised and the ironic thing is it's going to be disproportionately

[02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:55.020]
probably black voters who get screwed

[02:26:55.660 --> 02:27:02.780]
When she screws up and it's just these reverends are these ministers in the black community all they see is skin color

[02:27:02.780 --> 02:27:07.320]
They don't see what it was you know how she's hurting their community. It's really terrible

[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:08.920]
Yeah, this thing is going on

[02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:11.440]
I've been fighting it for years and it just makes me want to vomit there

[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:14.360]
And so it's a part of the black community certainly not all of them

[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:17.440]
But there's that segment of black people. It's the same with OJ

[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:21.980]
Oh, he got a raw deal. He didn't do it. There was a the bloody glove was planted

[02:27:21.980 --> 02:27:27.020]
You know all of the Mark Furman any excuse in the world that black people never do anything wrong

[02:27:27.020 --> 02:27:28.620]
I want to tell you something right now seriously

[02:27:29.180 --> 02:27:34.020]
I'm sitting here in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which is one of the safest big cities anywhere in North America

[02:27:34.020 --> 02:27:40.940]
We've had like 46 or 47 murders all year long in this city the overwhelming majority of those and I know this because I follow the news

[02:27:40.940 --> 02:27:42.240]
I watch the news here every day

[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:49.740]
Are have been committed and the the perpetrators and the victims are black now. There's something wrong with this picture

[02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:51.740]
Okay, there's something wrong with this

[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:56.980]
Yeah, and as you point out it's principally black victims too

[02:27:56.980 --> 02:27:58.520]
That's what I just said

[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:07.560]
And of course people like Victor Curry this guy this bishop curry

[02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:14.900]
He's just a professional OJ on provocateur to kind of like a little league Jesse Jackson who just goes around from one one crisis to another

[02:28:15.340 --> 02:28:16.760]
Polonating and stirring up the crap

[02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:21.780]
I agree and have a great day. Take care. Okay. Yeah, he was on remember that awful show

[02:28:21.780 --> 02:28:24.920]
They invited me to do one channel 10 with Michael Puntini and I said no way yes

[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:30.540]
He was on there along with that professional speaker who ever it. Hello was a wiper. Huh? What's her name?

[02:28:30.940 --> 02:28:35.620]
Well, yeah, we're not the early aniraz some other professional speaker and and it was one of the most

[02:28:35.620 --> 02:28:39.540]
Rotesque one of the ugliest and by the time Peter Jennings left that set

[02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:44.460]
He probably shook his head and talked to himself. You got to be kidding me. This isn't the city Miami

[02:28:44.460 --> 02:28:48.820]
This is a battle zone. This is a nut house and Peter you were absolutely

[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:51.800]
Not only that Peter how's it going? Hey

[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:54.700]
I don't like ABC news

[02:28:56.060 --> 02:28:57.020]
I don't like him

[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:03.020]
He to me is like, you know, he's stuffy and dry, you know what I mean? Yeah, not not Canadian

[02:29:03.020 --> 02:29:07.500]
I mean you watch the Canadian news like on cbc and there may be a little on the dry side, you know

[02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:09.100]
But but he's like real

[02:29:09.820 --> 02:29:12.700]
What well? I would point immediately to the

[02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:16.860]

[02:29:16.860 --> 02:29:19.120]
He's in vagina right now. What is on the air?

[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:22.420]
But Peter Jennings he just the may just leaves me limp

[02:29:22.420 --> 02:29:26.420]
And then of course Dan Rather after that quote by a Michael Moore of his oh jeez

[02:29:26.420 --> 02:29:29.980]

[02:32:43.740 --> 02:32:46.300]
Pupik so lose belly fat for it based on what?

[02:32:48.880 --> 02:32:50.360]
based based on what?

[02:32:50.860 --> 02:32:56.380]
Okay, because we're eating lean cuts of meat and because he ripped off atkins almost verbatim in here

[02:32:56.960 --> 02:33:02.120]
I don't know anybody on atkins who lost belly fat first. I know a lot of people went belly up

[02:33:03.160 --> 02:33:05.060]
Hey, by the way, speaking of that, how's Jeff Cohen doing?

Uh George W. Bush 165 he's talking about dead soldiers and dead Marines I guess they're dead Marines in the future

[02:33:35.060 --> 02:33:40.920]
He's got 167 votes even while he's speaking troops the number keeps going up and the dead soldiers too

[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:45.900]
Strom thermon 81 Jesse Helms 78 dr. Phil 41. Nice go to dr. Phil

[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:51.680]
See I am gotta adopt a different attitude because I don't like people like dr. Phil and opera

[02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:56.780]
But the people we should be angriest at are the suckers the morons the lemons who goose step in the line

[02:33:56.780 --> 02:34:00.600]
Just like the ditto heads with rush, you know, oh well he'll be back and he'll be stronger than ever

[02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:01.980]
You know, he just had a little a problem

[02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:03.680]
Right right

[02:34:04.340 --> 02:34:08.540]
Toby key 24 Steve Spirious 15 Terry mountain 14

John rocker 12 Terry Bradshaw 8 Trent lot. She's got five with her pom-poms

[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:21.520]

Orville Fabus one must about his one Jerry Jones won none yet for Ernest Ainsley

[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:39.260]
Newt Gingrich Don I miss or junior samples. Yeah, out of 472 vote. You got a long way to go

[02:34:41.260 --> 02:34:46.420]
5670 560 pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line. How about those pantaries?

[02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:51.160]
I'm serious. I'd like to know what you think Scott. How are they gonna keep that franchise there?

[02:34:52.780 --> 02:34:56.060]
I mean next year you got no season the lockout is just with the guaranteed

[02:34:56.760 --> 02:34:58.180]
I have no clue right now

[02:34:58.740 --> 02:35:00.720]
Really sound like mad dog no clue

[02:35:02.020 --> 02:35:07.040]
If there were 7000 people there last night they must have been like hanging out outside like out in the hallways

[02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:12.280]
Was that the official tally no the official tally was 13000 some odd no way

[02:35:12.820 --> 02:35:14.520]
That's what it says in the box score

[02:35:16.820 --> 02:35:18.420]
13242 if I'm lying you're dying

[02:35:19.980 --> 02:35:24.420]
Yeah, it looked like about 7000 looked like about seven and of course one scots is about 7000

[02:35:24.420 --> 02:35:27.960]
Usually tries to paint that pant or picture with an extra rosy view

[02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:32.060]
That means there was like maybe five or six thousand. They showed an overhead shot

[02:35:32.060 --> 02:35:35.840]
Which I was surprised because generally Fox Sports avoids doing that and by the way Denise

[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:40.540]
Well, you shut up already god damn it that pot fan you know the game when they made a three to two

[02:35:40.540 --> 02:35:44.400]
And it looked like it was gonna really be an interesting game till a finally rolled over and died with 10 minutes to go

[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:45.840]
But when it got to be three to two

[02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:52.300]
And all of a sudden pot fans starts pop pop pop pop about stuff that had nothing to do with anything connected the game

[02:35:52.800 --> 02:35:57.540]
Almost even felt sorry for the rim man. They had two shots in the last 10 minutes exactly like I said

[02:35:57.960 --> 02:35:59.520]
Here's the lady implantation. Hello

[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:06.140]
I'm here. Yes, ma'am. I'm here. I'm implantation not coral springs or gables or whatever they call them

[02:36:06.740 --> 02:36:15.800]
Hey, um, it is a racist you with Mary elephant. Yeah, it is it is you know why it's the race issue because we need to have a new race

[02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:20.340]
She needs to drop out and we need to have a new race

[02:36:20.340 --> 02:36:24.580]
When they showed all those guys that were her supporters, they were like seven of them

[02:36:24.580 --> 02:36:27.080]
Sitting in the room on the news Mary

[02:36:27.860 --> 02:36:32.320]
Mary Molyfade supporters gathered here for hours. There's like seven people

[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:34.000]
Mm-hmm. So

[02:36:34.700 --> 02:36:39.020]
It's a race issue. We need a new race. Okay. The race is on

[02:36:39.900 --> 02:36:42.880]
Pardon I said the race is on I hope so

[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:46.180]
Plants are they were counting the people that were watching on TV

[02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:53.660]
That's how they got to that photo and they was the multiplying climb six ever great days. We'd hard hang in there

[02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:56.680]
Yeah, Panthers is a bad the organization

[02:36:57.900 --> 02:37:00.380]
Keeps trying to bolstemy the public. Yeah

[02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:08.240]
Very sad. At least go win tomorrow against Pittsburgh without Mario. No, and I know guaranteed about that

[02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:12.160]
What do you say that based on what the win tomorrow based on what

[02:37:13.220 --> 02:37:18.000]
We mean based on what the penguins one of few games without Mirio. I mean he you know

[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.060]
Here in here

[02:37:19.860 --> 02:37:21.320]
They got Marty Stracco

[02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:24.440]
Wow, who wasn't who wasn't good enough for Doug McLean

[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:27.560]
But at any rate five six seven oh five sixty they got Mark

[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:30.740]
Savard the ob-band what's his name the goalie

[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:32.920]
Flurry

[02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:38.000]
He's the 18-year-old goalie for Pittsburgh. You're supposed to be a hockey fan, mr

[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:42.220]
You're supposed to know these things. He's been playing sensational actually with it, uh, huh?

[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:46.520]
He's been great. That's your reason they've won a whole three games so far. The only reason they've won

[02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:46.960]
You're right

[02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:52.460]
It's just like the Panthers if Bobby the Wango wasn't playing most of the games they'd be getting blown out eight

[02:37:52.460 --> 02:37:56.620]
And I want to tell you something I don't want to get hockey intensive, but I did watch quite a bit of that game last night

[02:37:57.160 --> 02:38:00.600]
I don't know how they lost LA could it must have been the ice was even worse than usual

[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:05.780]
Which it's horrible in that building but all they can do was fallen down and then they kept passing it back into their own zone

[02:38:05.780 --> 02:38:09.340]
I the LA Kings to me were like a joke they were pathetic

[02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:15.060]
That was said even through my TV set on my hockey package all the way here

[02:38:15.060 --> 02:38:19.680]
I could smell the aroma from that stinker man. It was bad. It says Mike was doing his hashic impression

[02:38:19.680 --> 02:38:26.340]
He was stopping the pucks. He could easily given up six goals last night, but he didn't I know here's North Miami. Hello

[02:38:26.340 --> 02:38:33.000]
Hey, Neil. I'm pretty good. Good. First off, great show yesterday. How my job was on the ground staring at the radio

[02:38:33.700 --> 02:38:34.140]
Excellent

[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:39.780]
Second thing wondering if you saw the top five in the top five bookstays al Franken

[02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:40.140]
um

[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:44.920]
Michael Moore and the lady the bush back like three out of top five

[02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:51.180]
Molly Arvins. Yeah, Molly Arvins. My question is you think are these converts by any books or is these

[02:38:51.700 --> 02:38:57.480]
People that already know what's going on by any book probably both probably most mostly people already know what's going on

[02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:01.780]
I also want to make one comment too if I could go ahead

[02:39:02.340 --> 02:39:08.780]
Uh south Florida drivers when it is raining you do not put your hazards on you do not keep your light off

[02:39:08.780 --> 02:39:13.020]
You put your freaking light on assholes. You'll have to have her

[02:39:13.480 --> 02:39:15.640]
Right, your freaking light on right

[02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:22.660]
Damn you have a good hole. I need to and don't slam on the brakes as soon as the yeah ass hole right

[02:39:23.380 --> 02:39:26.960]
People that drive with her hazard lights on. I mean what what are you trying to prove to the rest of it?

[02:39:27.020 --> 02:39:29.320]
Are you giving us a message that it's kind of like dangerous out here?

[02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:32.620]
Oh, here's a bullet and it's raining real hard and we're gonna all get killed

[02:39:32.620 --> 02:39:34.800]
You know so put on the hazard lights. There's a hazard

[02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:40.440]
So I think they believe what that means is it's like you're announcing and there's a hazard out there. That's right. It's done

[02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:41.160]
Right

[02:39:41.660 --> 02:39:46.020]
No, no question about it. Well my mother wants you to know she's a very good driver. Okay great

[02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:47.780]
Thanks for the tip

[02:39:48.940 --> 02:39:52.060]
Even though she sometimes drives on the wrong side of sterling road

[02:39:53.220 --> 02:39:55.880]
That's a little spirie port I had my self-partial

[02:39:55.880 --> 02:40:00.260]
She was truly out for a sand something about what a crappy driver about she's a hundred years old which she almost is

[02:40:00.260 --> 02:40:04.340]
Uh, she got about as much business driving you're set to the store which is right across the street

[02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:07.040]
As my little dog didn't he probably would have done a better job

[02:40:08.300 --> 02:40:10.420]
She and John go to lunch last Saturday and

[02:40:11.580 --> 02:40:16.900]
Is she's returning back as she's driving she insists on driving because she's a great driver like a rainman

[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:22.320]
And she makes her little ui she's got you got to you've got to go to the right and then make a ui to go back to where she lives

[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:26.280]
Well, she makes her little ui there's only one problem. She's on the wrong side of sterling road

[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:28.100]
She's in the uh westbound

[02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:30.900]
However, you know what I'm saying?

[02:40:30.900 --> 02:40:32.620]
For two other than the median

[02:40:33.740 --> 02:40:34.060]
fortuitously

[02:40:34.060 --> 02:40:36.000]
Uh, there would no traffic coming for a long ways

[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:41.620]
And she was able to win a dog kind of straight it up cut the crap mile. Okay, you're not kidding anybody turn in your license before it's too late

[02:40:42.580 --> 02:40:46.800]

We thought he always back his money

[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:36.420]

[02:44:28.220 --> 02:44:31.520]
Wait to hear this story fish farting may not just be hot air

[02:44:32.280 --> 02:44:34.300]
Did you know that fish farted? I had no idea

[02:44:34.300 --> 02:44:35.200]
Well, I you know

[02:44:36.020 --> 02:44:39.060]
biologists have linked a mysterious underwater farting sound

[02:44:40.400 --> 02:44:42.340]
The bubbles coming out of a herring's anus

[02:44:43.100 --> 02:44:43.900]
Hary what

[02:44:44.940 --> 02:44:49.640]
No fish have been known to emit sound from its anus nor to be capable of producing such a high-pitched noise

[02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:56.340]
It sounds just like a high-pitched raspberry says then Wilson of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver

[02:44:57.360 --> 02:45:01.640]
Wilson, oh, and you can actually go online and listen to it get out. Yeah

[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:09.600]
This is a Yahoo story sir, but online and listen to it Wilson as speaking of Yahoo's Wilson that is colleagues cannot be sure why herring make this sound

[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:13.760]
But initial research. You just might explain the puzzle of how sholes keep together after dark

[02:45:14.780 --> 02:45:17.920]
Surprising and interesting is how aquatic acoustic specialists

[02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:22.260]
Did I say well, you know, I guess they want to hear a lot of underwater stuff

[02:45:23.100 --> 02:45:25.880]
Of the University of Windsor and Ontario described the discovery

[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:32.160]
It's the first case of a fish potentially using high frequency for communication he believes Arthur Popper and

[02:45:32.160 --> 02:45:37.400]
Bio acoustic especially specialist at the University of Maryland is also intrigued I'd have

[02:45:38.020 --> 02:45:41.620]
I'd not have thought of it, but fish do very strange and diverse things he says

[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:49.940]
Fisher known to call out to potential mates with low grunts and buzzes produced by wobbling a balloon of air called the swim bladder located in the abdomen

[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:53.900]
The swim bladder inflates and deflates to adjust the fish's buoyancy

[02:45:53.900 --> 02:45:58.920]
The biologist initially assumed that the swim bladder was also producing the high-pitched sounds they hadn't they had detected

[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:03.360]
But then they noticed that a stream of bubbles expelled from the fish's anus crack them

[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:05.620]
Corresponded exactly with the timing of the noise

[02:46:06.180 --> 02:46:11.280]
So a more likely cause was Eric's escaping from the swim bladder through the old

[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:12.840]
Brackum famous anus

[02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:17.540]
It was at this point that a team named oh, I love this you're gonna like it

[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:21.880]
It was at this point the team named the noise fast repetitive tick frt

[02:46:24.100 --> 02:46:29.780]
Okay, but Wilson points that unlike a human fart the sounds are probably not caused by digestive gases

[02:46:29.780 --> 02:46:32.560]
Because the number of sounds doesn't change when the fish are fed

[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:38.040]
The researchers also tested whether the fish were farting from fear perhaps to sound an alarm

[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:38.920]
Uh-oh

[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:41.020]
Here comes Greg

[02:46:42.940 --> 02:46:47.860]
But when they exposed fish to a shark scent there was again no change in the number of frt's

[02:46:49.180 --> 02:46:54.820]
Finally three observations persuaded the researchers that the frt is most likely produced for communication

[02:46:54.820 --> 02:46:58.200]
And that what you always do you see so strange in the elevator how you doing

[02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:00.280]
First

[02:47:00.280 --> 02:47:04.240]
When more herringer in the tank the researchers record more farts per fish

[02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:10.160]
Secondly, the herringer only knows the after dark indicating the sounds by the law the fish located one another where they can't be seen

[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:15.000]
Well, it's like people you try to hold it in all during the day than after dark you just went and doubt let them all out

[02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:20.020]
Thirdly the biologists know that herrings can hear the sounds of this frequency while most fish can't

[02:47:20.020 --> 02:47:22.080]
This one it sounds like a red herring to me

[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:25.900]
This would allow them to communicate by fart without alerting predators to their presence

[02:47:25.900 --> 02:47:30.440]
Wilson emphasizes that person this idea is just a theory but the discovery is still useful

[02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:35.420]
Herring might be attracted by their frt's the same way that whales and dolphins matter to by the high-pitched squeals

[02:47:35.420 --> 02:47:37.020]
You ever hear a grind cocks?

[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:40.540]
Fish him and might even exploit this to locate sholes

[02:47:40.540 --> 02:47:45.900]
There may even be a conservation issue some experts believe human-generated sounds can damage underwater mammals

[02:47:45.900 --> 02:47:49.920]
Now it seems underwater noise might disrupt fish too ready for that

[02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:51.280]
I'm looking forward online

[02:47:52.180 --> 02:47:53.920]
What I'm looking for it online

[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:59.680]

[02:48:44.860 --> 02:48:49.900]
Members of the district school board voted unanimously last night not to renew contracts to the five coaches

[02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:51.300]
In an emotional meeting

Robert Kelly allure for two of the boys who say they were abused was pleased with the board's decision

[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:16.120]

Faggery mm-hmm all the hazing always involves some kind of faggery

[02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:12.440]
Because the whole sports scene and all of fraternity thing that's a day club you moron even he knows that and lately

No, I know how she's doing so did you get the thing I thanks to to the

[02:52:18.440 --> 02:52:22.180]
Look for the audio now there you go. Oh, yeah, I can't wait to hear that

[02:52:23.040 --> 02:52:27.100]
This is an interesting story that I think I don't know if we put this on or not from the village voice

[02:52:28.260 --> 02:52:28.700]
The

[02:52:28.700 --> 02:52:32.260]
General and the senator west's bloopers give Hillary's troops hope

[02:52:33.440 --> 02:52:37.520]
He writes every time westley Clark goes weird on us like when he's the general said

[02:52:37.520 --> 02:52:40.760]
I would have been a Republican if Carl Rowe had returned my phone calls

[02:52:41.340 --> 02:52:43.780]
The campaign to nominate Hillary gathers momentum

[02:52:44.760 --> 02:52:49.680]
The most recent Quinnipiac University National poll shows are ahead of all of the Democrats you ready for that

[02:52:50.220 --> 02:52:54.940]
I'm ready. I think we'll do that as our number one pull them on the first hour if Hillary runs

[02:52:56.040 --> 02:52:59.020]
If Clinton decides to run she gets 43%

[02:52:59.560 --> 02:53:08.420]
10% for Clark 8% for Lieberman and Gebhardt 7% each for Carrie and Dean meanwhile it says her money keeps on rolling in

[02:53:09.820 --> 02:53:14.300]
Hillary's fortunes rise as bush weekends. It says the president's performance ratings are declining

[02:53:14.300 --> 02:53:18.140]
The pressure on Hillary grosses bush appears more and more vulnerable to attack

[02:53:18.680 --> 02:53:24.140]
During the slow death of GI's day after day rumsfeld celebrated on the right as the nation's most manly man

[02:53:24.140 --> 02:53:25.440]
Sounds off regularly

[02:53:26.140 --> 02:53:31.120]
Sunday an ABC declared that the US is just not organized trained or equipped to win hearts and minds overseas

[02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:34.640]
And then mused what is to what has to change in our country

[02:53:34.640 --> 02:53:40.540]
organizationally overt covert either one so that we can have a higher confidence that we're reducing the number of people who become terrorists

[02:53:41.640 --> 02:53:46.960]
Vice President Cheney's corporate buzz one more and more bush and his brother jeb are into some 16 playing doctor

Deliving dead bushes neoconn advise is not satisfied with total war in the Middle East

[02:53:51.180 --> 02:53:55.220]
Wannify China from space and now there's renewed talk of using small nuclear weapons

[02:53:58.060 --> 02:54:02.400]
So the bottom line on this is that Hillary might just come jump in here because we don't seem to have any consensus

[02:54:02.400 --> 02:54:06.520]
Even though Howard Dean's raising enormous amount of money and then of course he put his foot in his mouth the other day

[02:54:06.520 --> 02:54:08.860]
Would that think about the the the the Confederate flag

[02:54:09.380 --> 02:54:12.000]
Which they spent that whole debate the other night prolonging him about

[02:54:13.760 --> 02:54:19.980]
The political right which has cheerly used the specter of Hillary as a campaign tool to Galvanize its face

[02:54:19.980 --> 02:54:26.220]
Is now hyperventilating she's getting vitriolic against president bush week to folks at world net daily calm

[02:54:26.220 --> 02:54:29.880]
She's going postal she's going ballistic Hillary doesn't know the truth

[02:54:29.880 --> 02:54:35.520]
It's as much a stranger to the junior senator from New York as sunlight is to a vampire. They said they're getting all panicky about it

[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:39.220]
Because they know she'll probably will possess you think wait

[02:54:40.060 --> 02:54:44.140]
Where is it what you got the fish part somewhere? Okay, let's hear

[02:54:44.140 --> 02:54:44.560]
All right

[02:54:46.040 --> 02:54:49.120]
Was that it oh wait I stepped on it

[02:54:52.020 --> 02:54:56.960]
Was that it yeah played again Sam here comes

[02:54:58.340 --> 02:55:02.300]
For this thing slow here comes it's buffering

[02:55:10.320 --> 02:55:14.040]
Wow another first on the neo-Rigor show we're going to be in the Guinness Book of Records the

[02:55:14.140 --> 02:55:17.100]
First fish part ever played on American radio. I love it

[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:23.200]
Orlando Florida young Republicans can topple Sodom who's saying in Christian athletes

[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:30.920]
I see young Republicans can topple Sodom who's saying in Christian athletes can let Jesus rock their night away

[02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:34.800]
At the homecoming parade after high school officials read Wednesday. They'd let their floats roll

[02:55:35.540 --> 02:55:38.320]
Let him float kind of like alien right

[02:55:38.860 --> 02:55:39.640]
Yeah, he floats good

[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:45.480]
After officials had talked to Philip's high school in Orlando raised concerns earlier this week that the floats might offend some people

[02:55:45.480 --> 02:55:51.660]
The students involved contact to the Liberty Council and Orlando based right wing fanatical civil liberties legal group

[02:55:52.280 --> 02:55:56.720]
Schools cannot censor the message just because they disagree with the message said Matthew Stover present

[02:55:56.720 --> 02:55:58.500]
Then the general council of Liberty Council

[02:55:59.060 --> 02:56:05.440]
Students dropped their plans to sue on First Amendment grounds after the school officials agreed to allow the floats in tonight's parade that meaning tonight

[02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:10.520]
Students will be able to express the essence of their clubs and maintain proper decorum for our school event

[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:12.760]
Principal Jean Trackinski said in the statement

[02:56:13.360 --> 02:56:17.180]
The young Republican club plans to have students in black t-shirts with the word evil

[02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:19.820]
bowling before a statue of Sodom

[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:22.300]
You think they're going to be bowling for Columbine?

[02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:23.080]
No

[02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:30.040]
Other students in club t-shirts plan to chase the evil students away with silly string and then toppled the statue

[02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:36.620]
The fellowship of Christian athletes plans to float urging students to let Jesus rock your night away

[02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:41.560]
In which students will tear up signs with the word sex suicide depression and drugs

[02:56:42.200 --> 02:56:44.980]
Let's see when I think of suicide depression and drugs

[02:56:44.980 --> 02:56:49.080]
I always think right in line with that sex all of these terrible awful things right?

[02:56:49.720 --> 02:56:50.520]
Of course

[02:56:50.520 --> 02:56:57.920]
Sends a really good healthy message to all those good Christian athletes suicide depression and drugs and sex be banned

[02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:03.320]
Don't be doing it man. It's bad. I thought when you couldn't get sex. That's when you turned to suicide depression and drugs

[02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:05.600]
Oh, maybe that's it. That's what rice said

[02:57:06.460 --> 02:57:12.100]
