[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560]
Okay, I have to go all the time to snorkele.

[00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.520]
I gotta go to Neil Rogers on, he makes more station for the money than me.

[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.240]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.320]
Morning, Sky.

[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.620]
You're got to have a nice day, Neil.

[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.560]
I'm gonna live with it!

[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.120]
I'm gonna live with it!

[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.920]
I'm gonna give you another beer.

[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.300]
Bleh!

[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.300]
Back in the day when someone done us wrong,

[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.500]
we didn't take their crap.

[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.860]
In Pearl Harbor, when the jabs dropped their bombs,

[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.120]
we bombed them back, and now the Saudis, they hit us hard.

[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.120]
And on our cars, our little flags wade.

[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.660]
As that Saudi love and recharge,

[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.980]
points the bombers the wrong way.

[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.960]
And the Vain Barres to be in America,

[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.520]
where they follow books like cheese.

[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.880]
The United States of arrogance,

[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.320]
said by push and it's badly.

[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.140]
Read they gun this country,

[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.580]
but up,

[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.200]
hammering doors to darkest days,

[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.920]
and I used to read.

[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.000]
I don't want to be a packs of Americans.

[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.140]
In the goddamn USA.

[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.880]
What's a few thousand innocent lives

[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.680]
stop living in the past.

[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.960]
If you want that SUV to drive,

[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.520]
you're gonna need more gas.

[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.980]
It's the greatest country in the world!

[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.080]
They train us to believe,

[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.320]
and anyone who says that, obviously,

[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.480]
and so forth to lead.

[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.340]
And the Vain Barres to be in America,

[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.940]
where we paint three-aligic leaves,

[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.840]
wave a flag in what has,

[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.520]
with our head in the sand,

[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.540]
and blindly follow the powers that be apathetic.

[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.360]
Up, washing state for news on a 65-inch screen.

[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.880]
Scratch her balls and find everything's okay.

[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.580]
In the goddamn USA.

[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.280]
Oh, that's my armor.

[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.240]
1003 at 560 WQM,

[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.900]
moderately happy Wednesday too.

[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.880]
We don't want to overdo it,

[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.640]
because evidently there's all kinds of crap going on,

[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.180]
which, yeah, what do we know?

[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.800]
What do we know? Not much.

[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.220]
Not too much.

[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.320]
Okay, here's the first poll.

[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.280]
We got two polls today.

[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.720]
It's Wednesday.

[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.300]
It's TGI WD.

[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.720]
Thank God it's Wednesday.

[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.740]
Which means our big one to two-hour gives us

[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.400]
that one-hour reprieve gets us over the hump.

[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.540]
I'm serious.

[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.980]
That's the only thing it gets me through the week.

[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.180]
I'm so glad I invented that, you know?

[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.580]
Just like Al Gore invented the internet.

[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.680]
I invented the hump day.

[00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.660]
Here's poll number one.

[00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.760]
I'll give you the results from yesterday,

[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.680]
momentarily, but we can get this right up there,

[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.640]
Eric, because we got a really pressure-packed

[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.300]
show today, don't we?

[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.620]
Huh?

[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.020]
No.

[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.600]
Yes, we do.

[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.660]
Oh my God.

[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.600]
It's a lot of oil, baby.

[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.300]
We got oil.

[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.500]
What did I tell you yesterday?

[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.080]
I haven't tell you that.

[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.160]
He's in, man.

[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.400]
He won by a landslide.

[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.760]
You owe me eight bucks.

[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.140]
For what?

[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.360]
You said that the Nazi thing and the groping thing

[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.620]
would be as undoing.

[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.680]
And I said, it won't make a difference.

[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.380]
Oh, get it from rumor.

[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.420]
Poll number one.

[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.240]
Which of these statements do you most strongly believe?

[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.040]
Americans are poorly educated.

[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.800]
Americans don't give a shmit about politics.

[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.940]
Neal is anti-American.

[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.700]
America is still the greatest country in the world.

[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.420]
Or right now, I'm ashamed to be an American.

[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.240]
Those are your five magnificent choices again.

[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.680]
Do I do good poll or what?

[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.580]
You bet.

[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.540]
I do good poll.

[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.380]
That's what they all tell me.

[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.660]
Which of these statements do you most strongly believe?

[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.980]
Americans are poorly educated as in,

[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.420]
boom.

[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.620]
Americans don't give a shmit about politics.

[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.300]
Neal is anti-American or just plain anti-neal.

[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.240]
America is still the greatest country in the world.

[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.680]
Watch how you spell that, Nairic.

[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.580]
And right now, I'm ashamed to be an American.

[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.980]
Of course, that could have to do with the war

[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.580]
with our illiterate president,

[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.240]
with our illiterate governor of California.

[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.780]
So many things, all of these things.

[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.600]
It's really mind-boggling.

[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.040]
The fact that people in the media

[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.480]
could actually sit there with a straight face

[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.960]
and report this all last night.

[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.020]
And a public is like, oh yeah, it makes sense to me.

[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:21.780]
Like that.

[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.340]
Anyway, here's the results.

[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.120]
Yesterday's poll.

[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.900]
Over the years, what celebrity do you think is aged the best?

[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.840]
WQM, Retirement Line.

[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.560]
What's up?

[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.600]
Over the years, what's the limit?

[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.960]
My psychic powers are so good now that I was talking about

[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.940]
the bad and periscute thing.

[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.960]
I didn't, nobody even told me Miguel was there.

[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.100]
And you know who responded to me?

[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.820]
Miguel.

[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.980]
Miguel, he was there.

[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.920]
It was shocking.

[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.600]
What's even more shocking is he never came back

[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.320]
and gave me a figure.

[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.920]
You idiot.

[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.460]
Hey, listen, your chances of those world-series tickets, Miguel,

[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.880]
just went down the toilet today.

[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.880]
Over the years, what celebrity do you think is aged the best?

[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.780]
Retkell, well, 135, she wins to hand down your pants.

[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.540]
So, Fiela Ren, 104 though, she did very well

[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.080]
and she still looks ravishing.

[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.180]
Barbara Eden 71.

[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.180]
Heather Locklear, 65.

[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.300]
Dick Clark, 56.

[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.860]
56 people said they liked the way Dick aged.

[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.260]
Although, until lately, till Michael Moore got him,

[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.460]
Michael Moore was on CNN a few minutes ago with the

[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.220]
Soledad O'Brien for a silly puff piece and it was silly.

[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.600]
His new book is called Dude Where's My Country.

[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.900]
I've forgotten the name of the book.

[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.920]
I'm going to go out and get it today.

[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.400]
Dude, where's my country?

[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.960]
Got it.

[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.600]
Got it.

[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.360]
Goldie Hahn 49, Chong Kongri 39, Johnny Depp 36, Morgan Fairchild 36,

[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.420]
Fran Drescher, the nanny head.

[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.840]
Bapap turn, man.

[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.200]
WQAM.

[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.320]
Lex Luthor's head is so shiny.

[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.780]
He had to go see Check Alphi area, but Lex Luthor.

[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.100]
Well, you know something.

[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.020]
Tonight's tonight.

[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.760]
You never mind me at tonight's smallville.

[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.680]
Hey, don't forget.

[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.580]
John Stamos and Madonna had 28 of peace.

[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.460]
Ever see them together?

[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.860]
Marsha, hope not for his sake.

[00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.520]
He wouldn't touch that thing with your tongue.

[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.240]
Brad Pitt 27, Jacqueline Smith 25.

[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.600]
WQAM.

[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.460]
Oh, come on.

[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.960]
You didn't scream us today by the way, Scott.

[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.940]
WQAM.

[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.640]
Neil God speaking.

[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.540]
Hey, yeah, I just did see that puff piece on CNN.

[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.520]
Oh, they're interviewing Michael Moore.

[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.400]
Yeah, and she was terrible.

[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.500]
You know, that's how he was just really making fun of her.

[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.700]
And he kept talking about the crawl.

[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.740]
She's an idiot, you know.

[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.620]
Yeah, and she tried to correct him.

[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.600]
But yeah, she said, no, it says Michael Moore.

[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.520]
He said, oh, you don't know about the crawl.

[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.640]
No, it was true.

[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.160]
He pointed out.

[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.540]
I think he was trying to tell her to get down her hands,

[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.320]
and he'd get on all fours and crawl a little bit.

[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.500]
But I really like the fact that he, you know, he's, man,

[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.940]
he got it in there quick, a nice jab at the media.

[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.940]
How they were whipping up the fear, I thought.

[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.200]
Yeah, and he didn't edit him, which was pretty good.

[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.840]
Yeah, he said there is no terrorist threat.

[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.060]
Is it true that he's coming out with a movie

[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.280]
about the Bush administration funded by Disney?

[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.900]
Yeah, it's it's going to be the, uh, the book that just came out.

[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.820]
Dude, where's my country?

[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.020]
It's going to come out next September,

[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.540]
like just right before the anniversary of 9-11

[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.520]
and just before the election.

[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.020]
As in movie form?

[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.720]
Yeah.

[00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.580]
All right.

[00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.880]
Fantastic.

[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.660]
All right.

[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.840]
Michael Moore for president, man, he's got my vote.

[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.600]
Michael Moore, yeah, not Howard Dean.

[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.520]
He's a flip-proper.

[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.400]
Well, well, like I said, Michael Moore first, Howard Dean,

[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.500]
Wesley Clark's campaign manager, you're a result.

[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.240]
I'll get to that.

[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.120]
For all you Wesley Clark bandwagon jippers,

[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.400]
Chris, it shouldn't surprise me because South Florida is the home of the bandwagon jumper.

[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.020]
We love the Marlins.

[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.580]
They won last night.

[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.440]
And every ticket is, yeah, let's get those Marlins tickets given away.

[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.160]
How many we got?

[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.240]
About 30, man.

[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.120]
Okay, they 1-9-8 and 11-10.

[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.100]
These Mike Lowell came through man a home run fest.

[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.900]
I didn't see any of it.

[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.400]
Yo, I hate to admit this.

[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.280]
I forgot about it.

[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.200]
They said a record.

[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.760]
That really feel?

[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.320]
Yeah, the Marlins hit three home runs and one inning.

[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.120]
Yeah.

[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:40.860]
That's right.

[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.400]
I saw the highlights, Scott.

[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.480]
It's not like I'm a total bozo, mostly, but not totally.

[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.700]
But the point I'm trying to make is that all the bandwagon jippers are foaming at the

[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.520]
mouth now because they can almost smell it, you know?

[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.980]
Marlins are the team of destiny.

[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:55.800]
You can smell it.

[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.360]
You can feel it.

[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:56.960]
You can squeeze it.

[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.920]
He got about five grand.

[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.040]
We got some tickets for you.

[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.140]
Dick Clark 56, Goldie Han 49, Sean Conrad 30, a nine.

[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.000]

George Hamilton 9.

[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.240]
Oh, what a great performance in Godfather 3.

[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:30.820]
No.

[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.020]
Harrison Ford and Victoria's principal each had eight.

[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.600]
Mick Jagger is a Belarusian.

[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.060]
Jane Fonda each had seven.

[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:37.740]
See them together.

[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.560]
You really know.

[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.980]
Bob Barker had the six as did Cheryl Teagues.

[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.080]
Tom Selich, Pho.

[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.640]
You think Tom Selich is still doing Higgins?

[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.520]
Denise Austin, Tom Selich, let's see, Michael Jackson.

[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.840]
Tom Selich.

[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.800]
Tom Cruise.

[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.380]
I'm trying to think of all the guys, all the famous people who have press conferences

[00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.820]
to announce that they're not gay.

[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:01.800]
Right?

[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:02.440]
Right.

[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.520]
Denise Austin 3, Jeff Bridges 2, Kurt Russell 2, Billy Crystal.

[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.840]
I'm holding a press conference at 230 this afternoon to announce that I am gay.

[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.520]
You're gay.

[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.540]
Kurt Russell 2, Billy Crystal and Carol Aldi did.

[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.540]
And poor Lorenzo Lamis is a second-win man.

[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.180]
He last place.

[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.320]
He finally got a sympathy vote there right at the SN.

[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.860]
Lorenzo Lamis out of nearly a thousand votes.

[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.440]
So that was yesterday's four.

[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.520]
I thought it was pretty interesting thing to think about, but as usual, they're like,

[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.960]
and then you were trying to shove Catherine Zita Jones on here,

[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.840]
who just turned 15 or whatever it was.

[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:33.060]

[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.420]
The hell wasn't you kept saying, well, if, uh, if, uh, who was it?

[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.180]
Heather Lockler.

[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.160]
If Heather Lockler can go on here, so we looked it up on the Awikid Web,

[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.100]
Heather Lockler is 42, and Catherine Zita Jones is only 34.

[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:46.980]
Okay, she's like,

[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.880]
About 30 minutes.

[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.940]
So what are you talking about?

[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.900]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.380]
That must be your friends at Bell South.

[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.060]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.560]
W-Q-A-M. Hello.

[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.080]
I'd like to speak to Neil P.

[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.700]
Speaking.

[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.280]
Neil, how are you doing?

[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.660]
I'm doing sensational.

[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.000]
Great, great.

[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.700]
I'm wondering if I can get the, the rambling willy recall tickets.

[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.160]
Rambling willy Bob Farrington, by the way, hit him again, Bob.

[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.760]
You remember rambling willy?

[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.100]
No.

[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:20.760]
Oh.

[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.260]
Once the race did pomp and oparque, I believe many years ago,

[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.080]
it all forget pomp and oparque opens Friday night.

[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.420]
There are 40th anniversary scene.

[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.200]
There's a little free plug.

[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.380]
Oh, and this spot's coming around.

[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.040]
I can't believe I did that.

[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:31.320]
Wow.

[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.060]
Holy moly.

[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.280]
I wasn't even looking at the log.

[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.400]
I got my spots piled up here in the right order,

[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.720]
which I do every day because I'm a very organized kind of guy.

[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.040]
But I had no idea.

[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.240]
I'm going to keep track today.

[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:41.580]
How many?

[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.840]
That's three psychic instances.

[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.500]
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.080]
I'm scary.

[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.760]
Let's all go to the track and make a fortune.

[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.240]
Let's, uh,

[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.340]

[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.060]
Oh, man.

[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.480]
Holy to moly.

[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.160]
Give us the numbers.

[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.060]
I'll give you some numbers.

[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:55.980]
2468.

[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:57.700]
Who do we have?

[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:57.980]
That's the lady.

[00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:58.600]
Yeah.

[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.360]
I don't know.

[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.760]
So what's the story with Farrell?

[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.320]
Are we not going to be doing crossovers anymore?

[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:03.800]
Is he just trying to see?

[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.700]
No, no, I think he's, uh, I don't know.

[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:06.840]
He's just pounding.

[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:07.940]
He's having the right now.

[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:08.620]
Oh, okay.

[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.620]
I think we were crossing over with Farrell.

[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.540]
Yeah, John Edward is going to be on with the two of us to try to

[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:14.720]
straight.

[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.660]
And if he can't do it,

[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.160]
Riva from guiding light is going to like,

[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:17.700]

This is my city.

[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.500]
The radio is on your side.

[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.060]
You will.

[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:00.700]
No.

[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.220]
Who's going to get Ricky a blow?

[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:05.580]
No.

[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.780]
Oh, we're flying.

[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.380]
Oh, we're flying.

[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.360]
Don't do that, Dan.

[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.820]
And took a hit then Woody.

[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.680]
I'd like to teach him some.

[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.180]

[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.180]

[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.180]

[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.180]

[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.180]

[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:26.200]
And get the munchies and make brownies filled with hair.

[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:26.760]
Yes.

[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.740]
And Woody share it with Jesus and the saints.

[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.800]
The pie is hot and yeah, yeah.

[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.160]
Hot is great and yeah, yeah.

[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:49.460]
Hot is good and yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.140]
Hot is God's most cannabis.

[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.300]
Smoke and fire's life one of us.

[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.320]
Getting high on the back of the bus.

[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.400]
Just in the nose of getting storm.

[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.100]
On a grey hump us too long.

[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.980]
To get some bad luck in old Rome.

[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:19.900]
Absolutely.

[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.720]
A couple of John backs to take home.

[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.680]
Smoke up big by Marley on his throne.

[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.320]
No fun in heaven less your soul.

[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.820]
Well, the reason I'm playing that is yesterday the game do's your of the cranks out there.

[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.040]
It was like, oh, what we want to hear about Canada and you're always the town Canada Canada sucks.

[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.380]
Well, you may have a point.

[00:14:50.240 --> 00:15:04.080]
The Ontario Court of Appeals yesterday reinstated the law banning possession of small amounts of cannabis for recreational use while at the same time made it easier for medical marijuana users to get safely a good supply of the drug as opposed to that crap that they were providing before remember couple weeks ago.

[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.640]
All the gims were a bitch and about the crappy quality of the medical marriage.

[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.520]
We remember that.

[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:09.780]
Yep.

[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.720]
Am I interrupting something down there you haven't like some kind of a fart fest or something going on?

[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:16.680]
No.

[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:17.980]
I just get that feeling.

[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.960]
I feel like there's like a whole bunch of people running around there like that right now.

[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.080]
It could be wrong, but I have a feeling my psychic powers are zooming in again.

[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.280]
Like that right in the hallway probably for relas one of them.

[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.960]
He's going like that.

[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:31.780]
Yeah.

[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.060]
And up is a double gray.

[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.340]
Greg. What am I going to do?

[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:41.800]
Greg, I got a good medical report from Duff this morning who's giving me all those things about his back and about his hemorrhoids and about all these other things.

[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:48.880]
Greg, I doubt you know you're a good friend. You're a good guy, but I'm sick and tired of hearing a medical report especially at a time when all of a sudden the crap is going down.

[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.520]
There are a lot of crap.

[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.000]
Yeah.

[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.260]
A lot of crap.

[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:51.640]
Really?

[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.480]
Down the down the shoot.

[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.960]
Lots of good place for it.

[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.860]
So anyway, simple possession marijuana is illegal again in Ontario.

[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:03.780]
So those of you who are planning to come up here and walking around in the streets like downtown, like at the Eden Center, lightening up a big fat one.

[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.680]
Public, you better think a second time.

[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:12.500]
Look at this. The lovely Miguel faxes me. We got about 30,000 and 25 bucks for a band and per rescue.

[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.180]
It's the 8th of October.

[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.660]
That's still pretty weak.

[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.640]
The way I'm looking at it.

[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.140]
It's slow.

[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.200]
Yeah.

[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:18.940]
Keep it alone.

[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.520]
And that's cause nobody's got two nickels to rub together.

[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.900]
That's a part of it. And that's why charity is like begging and screaming and pleading this year.

[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:27.480]
Who's shaking?

[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.980]
She's on a passion.

[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:30.520]
Oh, charity.

[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.300]
She's the one that has all the visions like I do.

[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:32.880]
She's begging.

[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.920]
She's begging and sharing is still alive.

[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.360]
She was underwater for about two weeks, but she's still alive.

[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.440]
And when I actually at the end of the show today, I should probably shouldn't tell people this, but it looks like she dies.

[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.440]
The line on the, what do they call that thing?

[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.200]
The oscilloscope?

[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.040]
Okay.

[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.000]
No, the thing that they hook up to your heart.

[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:50.740]
The heart monitor.

[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:51.760]
Electrocardiograph.

[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.160]
Yeah, it's the flat lines in your room like that.

[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.920]
Thanks for ruining it for me.

[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.500]
You don't watch that show.

[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.420]
Want a bet?

[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.520]
Well, I didn't ruin it for me.

[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.320]
I took away the stress now at least to be ready because you know she's not really going to stay dead.

[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:13.360]
And charity is begging the death guy, the death demon or whoever the hell he is begging.

[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.520]
Oh, please save Sheridan.

[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.680]
Oh, that's not talk about that.

[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.120]
Let's talk about important stuff like the next van hit for a van in Pair Rescue with our best of meal merchandise.

[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.880]
Or, yes, the new cartoon on the O'Rodgers.com right up on top.

[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.820]
Okay, go look at that right now.

[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:31.900]
But in the meantime, like I said, the next van hit will be tomorrow noon to two.

[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.020]
See, you're just trying to distract me from this because the van hit is sponsored by the wheel of yellow pages from Bell South,

[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.720]
which so you're trying to distract me from my opponent grounds.

[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.140]
Yeah.

[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.820]
Don't say it.

[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:43.500]
I'm not saying that.

[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.420]
All kinds of problems going on in a place and Duff is hyperventilating and blah, blah, blah.

[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.740]
And for all of us having nervous breakdown.

[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.300]
Yeah, I think I've solved the problem though.

[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.460]
Because I think over the years as we look back on the history of South Florida where you're going back many, many years,

[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:03.540]
it seems that there's really only one individual in South Florida who's really offended and put out by things that are set on the year,

[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.780]
either by me or Scott or whoever it is.

[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.700]
I think generally speaking, what we ought to do is take away his radio.

[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.100]
Oh, they're phone.

[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.080]
Don't you think that would solve all of our problems for all of us?

[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:13.600]
Everywhere.

[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.380]
Then he wouldn't have to be.

[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:21.320]
He's so offended and be monitoring and be so indignant over the fact that all of these terrible things are being said and yada, yada, yada.

[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.660]
Just take away his radio.

[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.040]
I think it would be a great pubic service.

[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.940]
It would be a happy word.

[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.160]
Kind of a wacky thing to do, but nevertheless, it doesn't make sense.

[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:28.760]
Anyway, the van hit.

[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.020]
I will get this from a lot by Hooker by Crook.

[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:36.500]
The van hit will be noon to two tomorrow, sponsored by the really yellow pages from Bell South at Power Sports.

[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.580]
See how much commercialization this is what we need to do at QM because we have a big pay rule.

[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:44.840]
And because Greg's got big ambitions, we've got to pay all those teams, all those franchise fees.

[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.920]
So every even a promo has gotten out instead of one commercial that they got two of them in here.

[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.940]
Power Sports at 1090 West Sunrise Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.880]
Where is 1090 West Sunrise?

[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.000]
Do we know is it near someplace?

[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:55.700]
Over there, yeah.

[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.140]
No, no, seriously.

[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.080]
I don't know what that means.

[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.760]
I mean, I don't know where 1090 would be.

[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.520]
Neither.

[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.540]
I'm sure they can find it.

[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.100]
Give your best of the merchandise, Arga, Fancy's Man's CCD's, the keychain.

[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:14.160]
I know how we're David and one's and the gym madness ones we have left over for everybody who makes a donation while they last.

[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.080]
We might actually have some Marlon tickets. No, we won't.

[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.300]
A pair of tickets to October Fest this weekend at the German American Club in Hollywood will be available though.

[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.140]
I don't know how he's going to do that, but he says that's a...

[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.540]
Now, is that mean there's several pair or eight pairs? I don't know what he's going to do.

[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:26.720]

[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:27.880]
What? No idea.

[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.100]
We don't know. So go and see Miguel tomorrow between noon and two and find out if he doesn't give it to you willingly.

[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.460]
Slacken around a little bit. He's easy.

[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.960]
30,025 bucks. Well, at least we got over the 30 more.

[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:38.860]
Not 30 minutes.

[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.360]
There's something.

[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.080]
But that's more votes than great Davis got in California last night.

[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:48.300]
And eventually he got... And they kept saying, well, Arnold is going to be a governor with...

[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.340]
It's very, very close. I don't have the final absolute final totals.

[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.500]
But from the LA Times, I've got with 97% of the vote counted.

[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.340]
Arnold got 3,476,301 votes.

[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.080]
And the no recall, which means the ones that were in favor of great Davis, 3,438.

[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:07.940]
You're following that? So about...

[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.240]
I got 38,000, Arnold, actually, I had more votes.

[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:16.540]
Arnold, which is scary in itself. It is frightening, man. It's enough to make me want to take a gigantic dump.

[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.840]
Oh, God. I think I'm going to do it anyway.

[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:19.420]
We'll wait.

[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.600]
About 25 to 30% of liberals and moderates abandoned the governor.

[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.420]
And Schwarzenegger had a strong showing across the political spectrum as the headliner in the front of the LA Times.

[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.300]
Absolutely unbelievable.

[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.280]
There's a really good article by Steve Lopez in today's LA Times.

[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.460]
I might read it a little bit later.

[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.340]
We have time under a lot of pressure today.

[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.300]
We've got to take 4,000 phone calls and say 25 Hail Mary's also.

[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.300]
Dear Gropenfuerr, muscles is way into office.

[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.320]
So what now, right Steve Lopez in the LA Times?

[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.260]
Dear Gropenfuerr, I just love that.

[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.320]
Not a great line.

[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.060]
Oh, God.

[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.300]
Yeah, he's doing the ol' Gropenope.

[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.320]
Here's the fact that says I'm not a sports fan.

[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.240]
I haven't got a clue as far as baseball is concerned.

[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.480]
But we're so blessed to have the Marlins in the playoffs

[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.180]
because at least it keeps my mind off all the depressing stuff like that farce on a West Coast.

[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:15.300]
And number two in Washington is going to get away with another major scandal because this is the dumbest company in the world history hands down contest over.

[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.340]
Thank you for a very, very accurate fact.

[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.840]
By the way, the poll, look at that, 133 votes. I just took a puke at it.

[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.960]
Man, we're on fire today.

[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.000]
Flaming.

[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.380]
Huh? Flaming.

[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.500]
Can't you smell it?

[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.420]
Which of these statements do you most strongly believe?

[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.820]
We've got 133 votes.

[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.640]
Prancid, you can say a douchebag.

[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.640]
Americans are poorly educated, 41.

[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.200]
Right now, I'm ashamed to be an American, 36.

[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.360]
America is still the greatest country in the world, 26.

[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:48.540]
Neil is anti-American, anti-16, and an American's don't give a shmit about politics, 14.

[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.760]
So 12% of the audience are saying I'm anti-American.

[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.080]
Excellent.

[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.140]
See, I put those on there for the segment of the audience that likes taking a cheap shot at me or you or, you know,

[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:02.280]
we're probably the only show in history that does that because, you know, we can handle it.

[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.220]
We got thick skin.

[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.580]
George's got four skin.

[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.360]
I got thick skin.

[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:06.080]

[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.400]
So here is this astonishing, amazing.

[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.300]
Oh, and also Miguel was trying to come around a little bit.

[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.840]
He said that Nestle's turtle is really good.

[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.280]
He hated the, he called it Ben and Jerry's fish.

[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.640]
Not fish, but the fish.

[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.880]
He just, such an idiot.

[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.840]
And then he said, but I did try Nestle's turtle and it was really, very good.

[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:25.840]
You're right. That's awesome stuff.

[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.340]
And then it come out to find out it wasn't even Nestle's.

[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.080]
It was Briar's turtle, which I didn't know.

[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.100]
Briar's made a turtle, which you got at Pubex, okay?

[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.080]
You're an idiot, Miguel.

[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:33.840]
You're a moron.

[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:34.800]
Very sad.

[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.140]
You look good, but man, you're dumb.

[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.920]
He says, go and show that, huh?

[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:38.800]
He says to Madre.

[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.160]
Yeah, to mama.

[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.340]
It's like a incident number four.

[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:42.740]
He to mama, Tombien.

[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.480]
Anyways, so Miguel likes a turtle.

[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.160]
So it's at public, so you don't have to wait for the Nestle's turtle if Briar's is making it.

[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.580]
If Briar's is making it, it must be pretty damn good, no?

[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.080]
Sure.

[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.540]
Because Briar's makes that score ice cream.

[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.440]
Oh, don't find that.

[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.280]
I sure hope you folks can't get ahold of that.

[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.320]
Because then you'll be cursing me out big time.

[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.280]
The same people who died from getting hooked on fish food because of me.

[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.680]
When they find Briar's score ice cream that's SKOR, then they'll know the score all right.

[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.620]
The blood pressure will be up to like 300 over 250, and they'll be dying over there.

[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.520]
But with a big smile on their face, that stuff is obscene.

[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.020]
It's so good.

[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.620]
Of course, you're not into that.

[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:17.600]
I don't know who it is.

[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.700]
The score candy bars, score in Heath bar.

[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:20.140]
Yeah.

[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.340]
That toffee thing.

[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.180]
Oh, man.

[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:22.980]
Let's talk to you.

[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:23.340]
Wow.

[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.800]
27 past 10 at 560 WQM.

[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.460]
Hey, if you've got that big shiny bald spot like Lex Luthor.

[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.360]
Here's the answer for it.

[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.040]
Chuck Alphier.

[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.240]
He could probably even help Lex out.

[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.980]
Don't forget tonight's small one on the UPN.

[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.240]
Don't forget where I think they're going to say the F-word a couple of times.

[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.260]
According to that bit we got.

[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:45.460]
I'd love to see if you don't know the time, John Jones, the song, the video, sex set, bomb.

[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:46.320]
Yeah.

[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.540]
You know that?

[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:47.900]
Sure.

[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:48.620]
Oh.

[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.100]
But if you don't know that, then I guess that bit is mis, but I love it.

[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.300]
I'm just obsessed with it.

[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:53.860]
That's what I've heard.

[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:55.580]
Yeah.

[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:56.480]
I love you, Bob.

[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.960]
Anyway, Chuck Alphier is the best in the world because he's got the natural hairline system.

[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.960]
He doesn't have some mousey-looking muskrat that died on your head or some nasty runaway weasel or a ferret.

[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.320]
He doesn't have holes that he wants to drill in your head and puts you through all kinds of excruciating pain.

[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:15.940]
What he does want to do is have you sit down and absolutely no obligation to give you a free consultation and show you he'll demonstrate it for you.

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.540]
He just how much better and younger he can make you look with his natural hairline system.

[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.040]
It's the best in business, so should buy even a millionaires and billionaires go see Charlie.

[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:27.660]
And you have nothing to lose but your shiny balls butt because everybody gets Charlie's 30-day guarantee.

[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:33.900]
If you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells, if you're not getting a hose at least 5, 10, 15 times a day, Charlie give you a full refund.

[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.920]
And be sure to mention my name because if you do, you get a $200 extra discount at the Charles Alphierry Studios.

[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.860]
Call him toll free and say goodbye for every year ball spot.

[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.420]
1-800-321-2413.

[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.340]
1-800-321-2413.

[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.780]
Or log onto his prestigious website at CharlesAlphierry.com.

[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:57.120]
We're Sports Radio 5-6-C-U-A-M.

[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.380]
Disgusting program.

[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.020]
I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:09.580]
He's the biggest baddest, prunist rocker of all time that he's not taking any prisoners.

[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.040]
He's Axel Schwarzenegger.

[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.160]
Welcome to the jungle.

[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.480]
We got fun and games.

[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.700]
We got everything you bought.

[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.480]
We blow you all to hell.

[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.840]
Axel Schwarzenegger.

[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.560]
He's all pumped up and ready to rock.

[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.800]
Take me down to Paradise City as a glass of screen and the girls are pretty.

[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.580]
Or as ticket grenade launcher for the sun bomb strike.

[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.640]
It's military industrial strength rock and roll.

[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.620]
The way only Axel Schwarzenegger can tell it.

[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.880]
Your van, ugly, the f***er.

[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.300]
John Claude Van Dam is a f***er.

[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.840]
Steven Seagal is a f***er with a ponytail.

[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.400]
The only reason I did a film with De Vito is because he could smite standing up.

[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.220]
It's Axel Schwarzenegger exclusively on Terminator CDs records in consent.

[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.880]
You don't fight this album.

[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:04.860]
I'll do that.

[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.660]
I think this will do.

[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.580]
Must lose.

[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.360]
You know, Sean is clump again of his victory speech last night.

[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.860]
Jarlano introduces him and he comes waltzing out with Maria.

[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.080]
Oh, Maria, I hope you can sleep good at night now.

[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:18.880]
You b***ch.

[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.400]
You disgusting sell out b***ch.

[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.080]
Maria Schreiber and Eunice Kennedy Schreiber.

[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.540]
The whole, oh man, the guns are mishpah-man.

[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.580]
I hope they can look at themselves in a mirror without cutting herself shaving.

[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.080]
Maybe that he can take them for a drive.

[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.380]
Yeah, that's a great idea.

[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.680]
Yeah, Uncle Teddy wants to take you folks for a nice drive over there in Champ Aquedic, huh?

[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.360]
Yeah, tip of view.

[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.740]
Locked for a nice drive in a country and reminisce about good old times.

[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.480]
Oh, I'm quite a poor Mary.

[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:45.860]
What was your name?

[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.740]
Mary Jo Peckney.

[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.000]
Yeah.

[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.040]
Was that Mary Jo the same as Billy Jo that jumped off the Tallahatchee bridge?

[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.700]
Ask Robbie Benson, hill today.

[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.240]
How come he was not our poet yesterday?

[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.080]
His product has nobody seen him in about 20 years.

[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:56.420]
Somebody mentioned him.

[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.220]
Yeah, we discussed it.

[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:57.420]
Did they?

[00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.400]
Haven't seen him in a long time.

[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.780]
Probably about 75 now.

[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.940]
You'll know you're getting real old when Robbie Benson is 75 then you're going to say, holy crap.

[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.460]
River Phoenix is still dead.

[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.240]
I should point out here.

[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:09.800]
What?

[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.560]
Well, there's some people that's funny about that.

[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:16.440]
Now, I'm looking at the second pool which I was going to start the, and then I thought, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.580]
See, this is my band.

[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.300]
I left a word out here.

[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.520]
What was the most horrifying death scene?

[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.640]
Oh, no, I didn't leave it out.

[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.640]
No, yeah, death scene.

[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:30.180]
Because we've done horrifying scenes, but we haven't ever done specifically this pool.

[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.760]
If we do exactly the same one, some nitpicker out there will come.

[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:36.040]
Oh, yeah, we did that like a January 3rd of 2002.

[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:36.900]
You did that pool.

[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.140]
Yeah, well, blow it out your ass.

[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.700]
Speaking of polls, did you look at the website yet?

[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.200]
No.

[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.060]
What do you mean?

[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.620]
The front page right up on top of the pool.

[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:45.800]
The new cartridge.

[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.240]
Okay, well, let me take a puke at it.

[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.360]
Okay, it's to die for.

[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.800]
Is it really that good?

[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.220]
Let me take a puke if it ever comes up on here.

[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.300]
Or Matthew, whatever the guy's name is, is that...

[00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.620]
No, no.

[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:00.820]
No, no.

[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:02.840]
No, no, no.

[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:02.840]

[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.900]
This one is the best.

[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:06.140]
Yeah.

[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.320]
This is the all-time best.

[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.800]
You are such a heartless bastard, man.

[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.500]
There's sick freedom, Roy, and there comes Tigger out of nowhere.

[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.220]
Is there Tigger?

[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.040]
Yeah.

[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:17.860]
There he comes.

[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.080]
Oh, no.

[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.520]
And this Tigger's counts and counts.

[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.360]
Oh, no.

[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.800]
Well, if you would have had some weedies that morning for breakfast,

[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.080]
there may be sort of frosted flakes.

[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.820]
They probably wouldn't be in the shapeies end of the day, old man.

[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:35.460]
Roy!

[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.460]
That is, huh?

[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:38.500]
Where'd you get that growl?

[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:39.320]
That's my...

[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.200]
Our lion sound effect.

[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.080]
Then, you know, that was in there?

[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.700]
What do you know about this or stuff?

[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.100]
Roy!

[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:48.720]
That's bad.

[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.240]
I love that.

[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.000]
Everybody must take a look at that if you want a good chuckle today.

[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.900]
Of course, some people will be like, oh, that's disgusting.

[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:55.240]
That's in such poor taste.

[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.280]
Well, Tony, a cartoon character, okay?

[00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:01.780]
If the Tiger would only be a cartoon tiger, he'd probably still be in good shape today, you know?

[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.220]
Instead of like hanging on via thread.

[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:09.140]
So anyway, here's the final, the very close to final numbers in California.

[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.580]
For those ten people out there in the audience who would have given crap,

[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.380]
with 97% of votes counted.

[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.620]
The first question on a ballot to be called or not to be called,

[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.500]
the very, very unpopular gay, a great Davis,

[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.240]
a man with a personality like a dead fruit fly,

[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.340]
54.4% said yes to the recall, only 45.6% said no.

[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.520]
So, and actually in LA County, they voted against the recall,

[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.100]
but in Orange County, they voted...

[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.320]
And all the other right wing parts, they voted humongously.

[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.060]
They hate him.

[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.760]
In the contest to replace Mr. Davis, Mr. Schwartznecker,

[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.660]
like his nearest competitor, Lieutenant Governor,

[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.480]
Celia Cruz-Bustamante,

[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.620]
47.9% to 32.4% with 97% of OK.

[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:51.280]
So in other words, 48% to 32%, a glanslide for AROD.

[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.120]
In an appearance before cheering supporters late,

[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.720]
and the night Mr. Schwartznecker opened his victory speech by thanking his wife, Maria Schriver,

[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.260]
saying, I know how many votes I got because of you.

[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:02.260]
But third man.

[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:02.600]
Right.

[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.720]
Introduced by Jay Leno.

[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.480]
Oh, it's just...

[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.740]
This is the end.

[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.600]
And this is the end.

[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.060]
And boys and girls, like Jim Morrison would say if he could, it's all over.

[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:12.060]

[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.360]
But the shouting.

[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.900]
There could open fewer muscles this way into office.

[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:18.640]
So what now?

[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.080]
I'm going to read that later on.

[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.340]
That's one of my favorite articles of all time.

[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.680]
That's hysterical.

[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.740]
Steve Lopez in today's LA Times.

[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:26.820]
There could open fewer.

[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.260]
Oh.

[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.800]
191 votes on our first poll today.

[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.300]
Which of these statements do you most strongly believe?

[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.320]
Americans are poorly educated, 64.

[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.600]
Right now, I'm ashamed to be an American 50 or saying that.

[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.420]
America's still the greatest country in the world, 36.

[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.280]
Niel is anti-American 23, 12%.

[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.700]
Anti-American bastard piece of crap.

[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.580]
And Americans don't give a shmit about politics, 18.

[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.500]
9.4% of nearly 200 votes in shocking number.

[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.600]
They're really whipped up into a frenzy, they aren't they?

[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.960]
That's because they're all excited because Arnold is going to California.

[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.200]
And the Marlins won in 11 in these last night.

[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.800]
Michael Old had a home run to win a game.

[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.480]
And what more could you want?

[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.800]
They've got more bad wagons to jump on.

[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.200]
We got all those free tickets.

[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.520]
We got that second poll.

[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.840]
I also added the show we're seeing in psycho, which had to be a classic.

[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.960]
What was the most horrifying death scene ever in a movie?

[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.640]
Father Karriss in the exorcist.

[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.720]
Melting Nazis and Raiders of the Lost Ark.

[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.460]
I didn't see that.

[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.400]
The impaled priest in the Omen and the show we're seeing in psycho.

[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.160]
With, um, don't tell me.

[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:34.940]
I can never think of her name.

[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:35.600]
I don't know why.

[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.260]
Don't tell me though.

[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:36.540]
All right.

[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.980]
Tony Perkins and, uh, I mean, she had like big building in a movie and she was in her.

[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:42.780]
Like for 10 minutes.

[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.720]
He picked the wrong motel.

[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.380]
I'll tell you that.

[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.240]
Well, I can never think of who that is.

[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.260]
And as soon as you tell me, give me your initials.

[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.280]
J.L.

[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.020]
Julie London.

[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.640]
I could be wrong because I'm thinking of somebody and I think it's because of who.

[00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.820]
Isn't it Janet Lee?

[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:00.700]
Janet Lee.

[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:01.200]
Very good.

[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:02.820]
Well, I'll see the wonder.

[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.560]
I can remember Pinkie Lee.

[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.600]
Yeah, but not Janet Lee Peggy Lee.

[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.640]
I remember Jack E Lee, which I'm trying to forget.

[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:11.260]
Jamie.

[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.040]
Dominic Q.A.M.

[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.020]
The Unchist Line 9.

[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:13.400]
Hello.

[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:15.740]
Yes, this Q.A.M.

[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:16.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:17.500]
Is Neil there, please?

[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.740]
Where you come from?

[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.360]
This sounds like the George tape sky.

[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:21.560]
The blue guy.

[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:22.780]
Yeah.

[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.040]
Yes, sir, speaking.

[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:24.760]
Neil.

[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:25.360]
Yeah.

[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.380]
How you doing, buddy?

[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.060]
Pretty good.

[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.680]
Uh, were you in T.O. these days?

[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.080]
I'm in T.O.

[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:31.320]
Yeah.

[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:32.900]
T.O.

[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:34.060]
T.O.

[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:34.400]
Hold on.

[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.780]
Let me cheer my computer out for a second.

[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.320]
Yeah, go ahead.

[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.220]
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.140]
We've got a short time.

[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.440]
We got that big one to two hour coming up.

[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.380]
This guy's a little whistler.

[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.300]
What happened yesterday?

[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:44.720]
I know.

[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.340]
I think you're right.

[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.980]
This is close to the end.

[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.240]
It's Jim Morrison once.

[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:48.880]
Yes, it is.

[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.840]
I think you saw an end to American democracy and intelligence

[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.340]
that last night in California.

[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.560]
You mean your political, fronty, mumbo,

[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:56.940]
Jumbo?

[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.620]
Doesn't even have that much influence that you can't win a,

[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:00.640]
you can't win California.

[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.380]
Oh, man, no.

[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.380]
That's a guy.

[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.060]
Somebody Q.A.M.

[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:04.260]
Hello.

[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:05.680]
Hey, Neon.

[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:06.840]
Hey, uh, how are you?

[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.260]
Since we had the rush drug story, man,

[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.440]
all the right wingers are like rattling their spears.

[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.080]
They're all like, great.

[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.480]
Oh, what are we going to do?

[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.020]
What are we going to do?

[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:14.560]

[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.660]
What are we going to do?

[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:16.880]
What are we going to do?

[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.100]
Yeah.

[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:17.940]
They're having a fit.

[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:19.600]
They're having a Schmidt fit.

[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.380]
Because they know whether pop the oxy-continor, uh,

[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:25.660]
the, uh, whatever.

[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.060]
The Massey Pads.

[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.180]
Wesley Clark's campaign manager quits.

[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.440]
Wesley Clark's campaign manager quits,

[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.560]
Tuesday into the dispute over the direction of the Democratic

[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.800]
presidential bid, exposing a rip between the former

[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.880]
genitals, Washington-based advisers,

[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.720]
and his three-week old Arkansas campaign team.

[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.420]
And for that jackass for the George tapes guy to call

[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.260]
him line nine to the, let me just say this to you.

[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.740]
My show ain't on in California.

[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.960]
And we probably changed the whole lot of votes.

[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:51.840]
But third, man.

[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:52.500]
They heard me.

[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.140]
Donnie Fowler told associates that he was leaving a wire

[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.880]
over widespread concerns that supporters who use the Internet to

[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.600]
draft clock into the race are not being taken seriously by

[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.460]
top campaign advisers.

[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.320]
See, he should be learned from Howard Dean,

[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.120]
who's got that Internet machine.

[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:07.740]
You know what I mean?

[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.740]
And it's pretty damn mean.

[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.640]
And, uh, that's what this queen thinks about that.

[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.460]
Raised a lot of money from the Internet.

[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.840]
So Wesley Clark's already a spokesman for the campaign

[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.740]
declined to comment.

[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.300]
Fowler also complained to campaign's message and methods are

[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.560]
focused too much on Washington, not key states.

[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.600]
And the burgeoning power of the Internet said to associates

[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.000]
who spoke on condition, of course, of anonymity.

[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:28.640]
So there you go.

[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.160]
Wesley Clark's already got hit and bumps in the road.

[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.040]
10, 41, at 5, 60 WQM.

[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.200]
If you've had bumps in your carpeting or whatever the hell they

[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.320]
look and smell and feel like, here's the answer for you.

[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:39.900]
Dry concepts.

[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.880]
They're the best in the world.

[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.960]
When they come to your home, you won't believe what happens

[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.700]
when they leave your carpet smell.

[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.260]
Emony fresh.

[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.420]
They look just like brand new.

[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.580]
They're drawing a couple of hours and you'll swear that

[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.880]
somebody came in and laid carpeting brand new on your floor

[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.480]
while you weren't looking.

[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.540]
That's what a great job they do, which is why I've used them

[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.900]
in my house for over 20 years for a long, long time.

[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.280]
You ought to be doing the same thing.

[00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.240]
They're the number one carpet cleaning company in the world.

[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.740]
And right now they'd like to save you a few bucks,

[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.860]
which everybody's interested in these days.

[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:03.820]
Aren't they?

[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.560]
There you go.

[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.360]
Dry concepts will give you a chance to say 15% on the next carpet

[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.980]
cleaning. Just call that toll-free number 1-800-248-5071

[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.920]
and ask to be put on their stand by list.

[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.260]
And then dry concepts will come in the next time they have an

[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.140]
opening in their schedule.

[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.760]
It's like when you fly standby, if you're available when they have

[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.020]
an opening, they'll knock 15% off the price.

[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.320]
So called dry concepts.

[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.960]
Today I'm asking to put you on their stand by list.

[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.920]
They might even open up on the day you call like today.

[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.440]
And you'll still get 15% off the price of the job.

[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.080]
And keep in mind, no rip offs, no scams, no bad surprises

[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.500]
when they hand you the built-in of the job because they give you

[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.380]
a written guaranteed price right up front before they start

[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.300]
doing their great job.

[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.160]
Call them today.

[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.380]
Tool-free at 1-800-248-5071.

[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.220]
Be sure and tell them that anti-American neopoldity call or just

[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.140]
anti-neil would be good.

[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.560]
This is sports window prices.

[00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.020]
UAM.

[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.400]
Err.

[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.020]
Err.

[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:06.760]
Err.

[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:06.760]

[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:06.760]

[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:06.760]

[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.360]
Err.

[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:16.680]
Err.

[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:16.680]

[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:16.680]

[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:16.680]

[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:16.680]

[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:16.680]

[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:16.680]

[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:16.680]

[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:16.680]

[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.480]
Can't believe the language I hear on TV.

[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.560]
Every home the word is an obscenity.

[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.400]
It used to be that cable was a whole lot worse.

[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.840]
But now the networks let their actors curse.

[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.600]
There's a women's sights of this obscenity.

[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.420]
All the dialogue contains profanity.

[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:43.660]
Swearin' like a seller on a 3-day pass.

[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.420]
Words a whole lot worse than ours.

[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.340]
Please don't say that.

[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.460]
F1-F1.

[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.500]
Call or will it be?

[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.860]
It's phoning drop the F1 on a Word TV.

[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:55.820]
Oh, crap.

[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.360]
F1-F1.

[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.200]
There's no telling where.

[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.780]
They'll drop one on a UPM.

[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:02.620]
Oh!

[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.340]
Probably bring it to middle of small veil tonight.

[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.340]
I can't wait for Clark to just win it down.

[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:06.940]
Bird it out.

[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:07.600]
Hey, don't forget.

[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.360]
Yes?

[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:08.960]
Small veil.

[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:09.800]
Oh, tonight?

[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:10.460]
Tonight.

[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.160]
1047 at 560.

[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.520]
Here's a great thanks that says from one of our weird chronics.

[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.620]
Right now I'm proud to be an American.

[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.040]
It shows the American flag and where the stars in there used to be.

[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.960]
And the upper is got a swastika instead.

[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:25.240]
And it says, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United Republic of America

[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.920]
to the dictatorship for what it's worth.

[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:30.380]
One F'd up nation under their furor with stupidity and apathy for all.

[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.540]
Sponsored by the SIGFREED and Roy campaign for governor.

[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:33.920]
Roy!

[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.740]
Oh, guess who's going to be on Larry King tonight?

[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:36.840]
SIGFREED?

[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:38.700]
Yeah.

[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:39.520]
SIGFREED fishbuckers.

[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:40.520]
Oh.

[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:41.900]
Fish what?

[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:43.440]
Fishbuckers.

[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.120]
Oh, oh.

[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.740]
Is that what it'd be on with Larry King tonight?

[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:46.980]
And you know what he's going to be saying?

[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.800]
Yeah, he's going to be making growling sound.

[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.720]
Because he's pretty unhappy about it.

[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.520]
Because now his livelihood went right down the turlitt.

[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.440]
I probably find some other sucker to go in here like, you know, play with big kids.

[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:57.640]
Sure.

[00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:58.540]
That's the thing?

[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.280]
566705, SIGFREED fishbucker.

[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.620]
I wonder if he knows their group and furor.

[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.740]
I bet he does.

[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.160]
I bet you they're pretty tight right now.

[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.420]
264 votes.

[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:18.320]
Which of these statements do you most strongly believe Americans are poorly educated 99?

[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.380]
Right now I'm ashamed to be an American 61.

[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.860]
America's still the greatest country in the world.

[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:28.500]
53, 20% Neil is anti-American 27, 10.2%.

[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:37.920]
And Americans just don't give a shmit about politics 24, 9%, 264, a shocking total in like about a half an hour, George.

[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.120]
What does that mean?

[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:39.800]
I don't know.

[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.120]
Nothing?

[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:46.700]
I think that the public is whipped up and pissed off to a frenzy this morning after seeing this debacle in California.

[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.980]
Even though we have a lot of people out there claiming they don't really care.

[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:53.980]
Because it isn't just about some stupid ass illiterate personality whose father was a Nazi or something like that.

[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.140]
It's about, and not even just about their group and furor.

[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:01.520]
It's about the fact that here we had another election stolen by the right wing in this country.

[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.060]
And you know, this is going to be the pattern.

[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.320]
And every time they don't win time, like that article I write yesterday about Tom Delay,

[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:11.560]
that we district thinking they're trying to do in Texas, so they can have a few more Republican seats in the Congress.

[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.560]
It's unbelievable.

[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.180]
And the public is, oh, here's Jay Leno.

[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.280]
Yeah, hey Jay, nice chin, baby.

[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.980]
See, they had to bring Jay Leno out because he's got a chin and Maria Don't.

[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:21.560]
Oh, good one.

[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.700]
Yeah, so somebody was going to play a mean chin ball.

[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.320]
They had to have somebody with a chin to play with it.

[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.700]
So they're playing with Jay Leno's chin.

[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.700]
God, what a disgrace.

[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.600]
What a, what a, a farce.

[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.320]
So every time there's an election result, oh, this is now who's this from.

[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.700]
Why is he doing this again?

[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:37.960]
Who?

[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.260]
PD Lenny.

[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.080]
I say, did you receive this yesterday?

[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.500]
You asked, hold on, I don't know.

[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.020]
I get it yesterday.

[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.500]
I talked about it and stopped vaccinating.

[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.120]
You're worse than normal.

[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:46.780]
I can't you idiot.

[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:47.520]
You moron.

[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.680]
PD Lenny, go away.

[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.120]
See, did I get it yesterday?

[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:51.680]
Go the hell away.

[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.500]
Okay, I wish I hope that the Mack truck runs over your ugly ass.

[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.360]
God.

[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.740]
It's just, it's pathetic.

[00:39:59.340 --> 00:39:59.700]
Pathetic.

[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:04.360]
The first lesson I want to give to all you kids out there when you grow up in about 30, 40 years.

[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:04.720]
How many?

[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:05.940]
About 30, man.

[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.960]
Don't give out your phone number, your fax number to any assholes.

[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.800]
Okay, because it's sure enough they'll use it.

[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.200]
Good lesson.

[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:14.940]
Don't give it out.

[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.220]
When in doubt, don't give it out.

[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.800]
PD freaking Lenny, my ass.

[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.120]
Go away, you jackass.

[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:20.660]
You okay?

[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:21.400]
You cybillin.

[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.540]
You cigarster Indian clown.

[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.820]
Always do this because they're all obsessed.

[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.280]
They're just their entire life revolves around this program.

[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.460]
In three years or if I should quote sooner, like in a few days.

[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.440]
About 30, man.

[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.100]
What the hell are these people gonna do?

[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.100]
Fold up their tent and just throw it all up to Vegas.

[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:40.640]
That's right.

[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.900]
Probably be on the cartoon on our website next.

[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.400]
W-Q-I-M.

[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.160]
Yes, hello.

[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:49.760]
Hello?

[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.080]
Yes, speaking.

[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.200]
How you doing?

[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:52.900]
Okay.

[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.420]
Oh, hey, you knew I was expecting to be put on hold.

[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.400]
I got a question for you.

[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:56.700]
Yeah.

[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.360]
A couple days ago, somebody called and told you about the movie

[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.360]
with Johnny Depp.

[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.320]
Did you get a chance to look at it?

[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.100]
Not yet.

[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.600]
Behind the night, behind the something, behind the fall.

[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.180]
Behind the fall.

[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.720]
Before night falls.

[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.900]
Before night falls.

[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.580]
Before night falls.

[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:11.660]

[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.140]
Right.

[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.600]
Before winter, there's fall.

[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:15.240]
All right.

[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.440]
I was trying to look for it, but I couldn't remember the name.

[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.040]
And even somebody else, but the George say,

[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.180]
if somebody said it was damn good.

[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.360]
I heard it was good from all kinds of facts.

[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.300]
I heard it was damn good.

[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:25.700]
Damn, okay.

[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.180]
Well, thanks a lot.

[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:27.760]
Okay.

[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:28.360]
How you enjoy?

[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.600]
Enjoy it, Pally.

[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.340]
Because time's running out.

[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.060]
Probably not going to be able to get any videos.

[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.520]
Probably only going to be able to get government approved videos

[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.620]
and stores from coast to coast.

[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.240]
Probably slot busters going to be deciding what you can see

[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.760]
and who you can think and what you can read.

[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.540]
Better go out and get that new Michael Moore's,

[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.040]
Michael Moore's, dude, where's my country book today?

[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.300]
Do we have to order that from Canada?

[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.160]
Yeah, but not if you're smoking a big fan.

[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:51.440]
That one.

[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.700]
Now, I do have to go out and get that today, eh?

[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.920]
Because pretty soon there'll be not going to be that off the shelves, too.

[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.280]
Because freedom is a thing that have passed in America.

[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.500]
You can't complain about our freedoms.

[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.100]
Now, the Patriot Act 3, 4 and 5 are going to come along,

[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.180]
which means that you can't fart in public.

[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.160]
Or even in private.

[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.180]
You've got to hold it.

[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.560]
And if you have like a duty look on your face

[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.600]
or if anybody thinks that you might be a little bit to the left

[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.660]
of a till of a Han man, you're a dumb hope.

[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:17.200]
That's all.

[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:17.800]
So lie a lot.

[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:18.880]
That's the best thing to do.

[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.460]
I personally love this president.

[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.140]
283 votes on our poll.

[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.900]
There's pouring in the votes today.

[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.060]
They're pouring in.

[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.420]
Now, how about some suggestions for our other poll here?

[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.840]
I mean, a little by little.

[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:32.580]
What?

[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.220]
We got like one at a time.

[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.020]
Oh, they're coming down the fence?

[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:36.260]
Yeah.

[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.240]
Well, what about on the phone?

[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.760]
If I take a lot more calls and stop BS in here, maybe I'd get some.

[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.880]
What was the most horrifying death scene ever in a movie?

[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.200]
Father Karris and the exorcist?

[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.740]
Melting Nazis and Raiders of the Lost Ark?

[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.020]
Well, you know, Father Karris and the exorcist, you know,

[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.120]
we didn't really see him.

[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:56.720]
We saw him go down the window down the stairs.

[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.180]
What we did see at the bottom of the stairs.

[00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:58.600]
Right.

[00:42:59.240 --> 00:42:59.980]
Come into me.

[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.100]
Come into me.

[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.980]
Kind of like what Kathy Willett's always used to say.

[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:03.860]
Come into me.

[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.320]
WQAM.

[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:07.400]
Neil?

[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:13.720]
Neil, have you ever seen the movie Final Destination 2?

[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.620]
No.

[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:19.420]
There is every death scene in that movie is like, is hideous.

[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:20.040]
Really?

[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.000]
Yes.

[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:21.700]
And you know what?

[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:26.080]
I tried to get through yesterday for your poll about who still looks good in age well.

[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.120]
You remember Gone Well from Gilligan Island.

[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:30.620]
Good choice.

[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.600]
I hated that.

[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:32.880]
You remember Jennifer Willes?

[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:34.940]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:35.580]
I love your show, man.

[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:36.000]
Okay.

[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:36.580]
Thanks, Pally.

[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.280]
You know, see that dirty little nervous life on this Jennifer Willes?

[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.700]
How about the scene from the alien where the mini monster comes out of these cyber-bots

[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.980]
test cavity at the dinner table for your poll?

[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.400]
And George Wright said, wasn't the cyber-bot, but it was still a good choice.

[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:50.780]
Yeah.

[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:51.580]
So I wrote it down.

[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:53.960]
It's not the tumor.

[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:55.800]
So we got it.

[00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.000]
I'm not going to write it down.

[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:57.560]
I'll let you write it down.

[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.500]
It's a long ear.

[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.340]
Because this requires a lot of iris.

[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:00.540]
What?

[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.520]
Going to go nuts.

[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:02.040]
Too bad.

[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:03.420]
Too bad.

[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.320]
We won't do this again, Eric, until maybe tomorrow.

[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.320]
We won't do this again.

[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:11.940]
We want to impose on his generosity and his time because he's a very, very busy guy.

[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.500]
Many, many meals to eat.

[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.120]
Look at this.

[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.900]
We're going to have 300 votes in the next couple of minutes here in next maybe 30 seconds.

[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:18.400]
How many?

[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.580]
About 30, man.

[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:19.920]
Man.

[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:20.500]
Oh, man.

[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:21.000]
Oh, man.

[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:21.560]
A chevitz.

[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.380]
So what's the deal out with Pharrellis?

[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.400]
He's going to do a religious show on a station?

[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:27.740]
Paid religion.

[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:28.480]
That's the way to go.

[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.620]
Scott, forget about ego, forget about all of a sudden bullcrap, forget about sports.

[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:32.980]
Just paid religion, man.

[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.320]
You can bring on some different faker every day and charge him like by the minute.

[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.880]
We're going to get a basket and pass it.

[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:39.420]
Now, Tis could attack it.

[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.560]
Let's put some into basket.

[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.560]
That helped us.

[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:44.720]
Oh, God.

[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.200]
Which of these statements do you most strongly believe?

[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.380]
301 votes.

[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:50.380]
Americans are poorly educated.

[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:51.120]
109.

[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.220]
Right now, I'm ashamed to be an American.

[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:58.400]
73 that's 24.2% of this audience is ashamed to be an American with this president with that

[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.760]
government, California, even with 3,000 miles away.

[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.060]
America, of course, look what we got.

[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.120]
America is still the greatest country in the world.

[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:06.560]
62, 20.45%.

[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:07.760]
There you go.

[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.080]
You keep saying that pretty soon.

[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:10.360]
You'll believe it.

[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.440]
Neil is anti-American 29.6%.

[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.220]
Americans don't give a shmit about politics.

[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.700]
28 out of 300 and 1 vote so far.

[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.380]
Their group of fewer is the governor of California.

[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.340]
And then the Michael Moore is on there.

[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.560]
And obviously, Tom and cheeky.

[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.580]
He said that he even suggested this book Oprah for president.

[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.580]
That's what it takes, man.

[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:33.540]
That's what America has become.

[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.300]
How about Oprah for president?

[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.080]
I'll vote for that bitch.

[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.680]
Anybody to get these Nazis out of there?

[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.340]
And then, Sola that says, oh, do you think America is really ready for a black female president?

[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.400]
Solae, Dad, O'Brien, man.

[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:48.740]
Bubblehead would be an insult.

[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:53.780]
If I called her a bubblehead, it'd be an insult to every bubblehead who's ever been born and was ever crawled around on a face of the globe.

[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:58.320]
She is a simple, a simple simple, then Solae, Dad, O'Brien.

[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:04.080]
Another big proof for the certainly not news network is they scraped her ass up off the MSNBC carpet.

[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.120]
Good God.

[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.260]
Even dry concepts would have tossed her ass away.

[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.800]
That's what a piece of crap she is.

[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:10.760]
Solae, Dad.

[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.000]
And then you got Aaron Brown with his pasty red wig.

[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:16.340]
And then you got Jeff Goldblum who sits on air.

[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:16.980]
Who don't want to say that?

[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:17.500]
Not Jeff Cool.

[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.500]
What's his in Jeff Greenfield?

[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:19.300]
Same guy.

[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.420]
Did he ever see him, Jeff Greenfield?

[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:22.440]
Was he in the fly, too?

[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.320]
Yeah, he should have been.

[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:25.640]
I only only wish.

[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:27.440]
God.

[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.220]
Just another whiny guy who doesn't say anything.

[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:32.760]
And well, the voters said.

[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:38.980]
And then there's that Wolf Blitzkrieg man who looks like he's ready for the next moon meeting.

[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.960]
He ever see him and Rudolph has together.

[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.100]
In fact, I hear Wolf Blitzkrieg gets his gas at his.

[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.200]
That's what I'm hearing.

[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.360]
1057 at 560 WQM.

[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.300]
By the way, those sounds that you hear coming from California.

[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:55.100]
Those who get your hip-hop maybe and start doing old goose step.

[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:59.140]
Everybody knows what goose, but nothing but the old goose step.

[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.440]
That's what we're doing.

[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.360]
Hey, let me tell you right now a great place where you can get away from all this crap.

[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:06.060]

[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.440]
Go down there and chop her a new vehicle or a used one in comfort.

[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:10.860]
Would it be a small on your push?

[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:11.960]
Because they treat you right.

[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.140]
That's why Halette Pontiac's been around over 35 years.

[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.340]

My life is local, we are sports radio 560, US, UAM.

[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.320]
I've been a user for a long time.

If anybody has opinion, dissenting from all ways, we'll place your name into the system and send a me out this day.

Don't even bother to question, just follow and don't fail.

[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:17.200]
Everybody's running fast, it's as if you were staying in the act of patriotism.

[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:31.700]
You're watching all of you, everyone does a suspicion, so what you do is a suspicion.

[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:42.700]
And all you might miss is in which power landation has just USA.

[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:50.820]
You gotta hate those Jews and Clinton's liberals too.

[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:57.840]
Believe everything we carry on the state run you.

[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:06.400]
Blood war and forth for blood fill up your escalaries.

[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:12.840]
A roof and tiny bush venue, back as USA.

[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:20.780]
We don't want to steal our jobs so, but that economy's good.

[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:29.260]
We're fascinated by trade, no, no need no stupid rules.

[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:35.980]
No, all the hour is crazy, the facts are Vatican way.

[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:43.160]
Everybody's earning vases, such as USA.

[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.820]
Love it 04560 WDQAM, Sieg Hyle, baby.

[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:58.820]
Everybody go step a couple of steps across the aluminum right now in your office and put that arm proudly, that right arm up at that 45 degree angle and say, Sieg Hyle, let's do it.

[00:50:58.900 --> 00:50:59.300]
Come on.

[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:02.900]
Be role-focusing on next step, the economy.

[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:03.660]
Right.

[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:09.320]
Dear Gropenfuer, muscles is way to office, so what now writes Steve Lopez in the days L.A. Times?

[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:17.940]
He says you can count the days now until Arnold Schwarzenegger is governor of California and great Davis is working as a coupier at the Marango Casino in Amazon.

[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:25.920]
The final tally isn't in as I pour myself a celebratory drink on Tuesday night, but we've got something even more solid than a final tally.

[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:29.760]
See, and just as Jay Leno was about to make a victory appearance with Schwarzenegger.

[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:30.420]
Perfect.

[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:40.500]
A campaign that began with the late night comedian might be notarized by him, and so we've had our little revolution and the new emperor is their Gropenfuer, which in Austrian means, governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:47.880]
By the way, those who believe the L.A. Times was trying to knock out Schwarzenegger last week with stories about his growing proclivities over looked to important points.

[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:53.260]
First, if the plan was to knock him out, the stories would have run much sooner than they did when they might have had done some damage.

[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:57.320]
Second, any self-respecting hack would rather have Schwarzenegger to write about than Davis.

[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:01.180]
In fact, I'm from Northern California and I'm thinking of moving back.

[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:07.020]
I'll just have to wait and see if Schwarzenegger decides to actually live in a state capital or take the private jet home to Brentwood each night.

[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.580]
One thing I have to say about Arnold is that his victory was no fluke.

[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:14.700]
Yes, we all know this was primarily about the hated governor great Davis not Schwarzenegger.

[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:30.580]
We know there was growing rage about the way businesses done in Sacramento were lobbyist on every lawmaker, and we all know Californians believe that and ripped off on everything from electric bills to vehicle license fees, and they're not too happy about having the show off for illegals about to flock north for the free driver's licenses Davis is passing out.

[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.480]
But let's give Arnold the credit he deserves.

[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:46.360]
If you can trample your own campaign promises, avoid talking about fixes for the state's problems, drive a hummer in Smog City, get accused of poising 15 women and still captivate an electorate in which Democrats hold a huge advantage, you deserve to be governor and the people deserve you.

[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:52.480]
I'm reminded of the candidate, the film in which Robert Redford plays a rookie who pulls off an upset and wins election of the US Senate.

[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:56.780]
In the last scene, Redford turns to his campaign manager and asks, what do we do now?

[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:04.680]
That's the $10 billion plus question for governor Arnold and all of California now that this latest advantage in sunrise democracy is drawing to a close.

[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:14.920]
Right now we've got fiscal and ideological impasse, the state librarian Kevin star, Republicans want no new tax, there's no new anything and let's lay everybody off, it's the meat cleaver approach.

[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:21.200]
The Democrats on the other hand have got to learn something from the Republicans, you just can't spend, spend, spend like you're on a sugar high.

[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:32.820]
Sure, but in such a polarized culture, how can Arnold or anybody else get the Republicans and Democrats to agree on the time of day, let alone find common ground on whacking programs, putting it into borrowing and be working the tax system?

[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:43.360]
There's only one way it can happen and you may not like hearing it, you're going to have to hold them accountable, which means you've got to start paying attention to stories about state government even when they don't directly involve big boy.

[00:53:43.900 --> 00:54:00.720]
Early in the recall campaign, I wrote the following paragraph about the life cycle of the average eligible voter in California, pay no attention, pay no attention, pay no attention, get happy mad about what happened about no one was paying attention, sign a petition, skip the election, complain briefly about the consequences, pay no attention, pay no attention, pay no attention.

[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:11.320]
That's right, you're responsible for the state's promises, anybody else. Half of you didn't bother to vote in the 2002 election for governor, you probably still don't know who your state assembly and the Senate representatives are.

[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:19.300]
You saw dozens of stories in this newspaper about the state budget and quickly flipped to the TV listings, you saw stories about campaign finance reform and you latched into a coma.

[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:26.120]
You didn't even pay attention when I told you Davis had an obsessive compulsive fundraising disorder and that we were going to pay dearly.

[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:36.240]
You run CS until a celebrity action hero through his Mr. Universe crowded into the ring, then all of a sudden your nap was over, you were a student of state politics and you buttoned the idea that a recall could fix everything.

[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:45.720]
Well, guess what Sparky? I like the idea of a Republican Muslim writing heard over a spin happy Democratic legislature, but nothing's going to be fixed overnight no matter what you were promised during his campaign.

[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:50.300]
In fact, as you read this, the governor is probably looking at this team and asking, what do we do now?

[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.080]
Good article by Steve Lopez in today's LA Times.

[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:56.960]
Their broken fewer muscles is way too often so what now?

[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.260]
So good. Isn't that great?

[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:04.180]
Their broken fewer. Oh, let's don't ever forget that line. What a great.

[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.040]
Here's governor, broken fewer.

[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.320]
Let's go step, baby. Come on.

[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:15.800]
Forget the twist. Forget the holy gully. Forget all of these things. Forget the hip hop crap. Let's go step.

[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.520]
It's the American F and way now.

[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:24.240]
355 votes on a pool. The audience is foaming at them out today. They're like rabid. They got rabbis.

[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:31.120]
Which of these statements do you most strongly believe Americans are poorly educated 131 right now?

[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:43.440]
I'm ashamed to be an American 81 America is still the greatest country in the world. 78 Niel is anti American 34 9.5% and Americans don't give a shmit about politics 31 or 355 votes.

[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:49.120]
A spectacular total in dust and an hour George. I think I think we ever had in less than an hour.

[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:54.220]
I think it's time for a hour of power. Maybe a shower. Sounds good to me.

[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.280]
That'd be a golden shower. Wait to hear this story.

[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:04.960]
I love it. Isn't that interesting? We're leading in our pool and you people are getting it right by the way.

[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:10.500]
Americans are poorly educated. What's in here this now? The Gallup News Service granted George Gallup as a well known Republican pollster.

[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:18.240]
Even though it doesn't call himself such, but he's a right-winger. Not a real extreme right-winger, but like, you know, for four years before there really was a rabid right-wing.

[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.260]
But anyway, regardless of that, I believe it.

[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:28.820]
Princeton, New Jersey Gallup Organization reports 45% of Americans believe the newsmeat in this country are too liberal.

[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:35.580]
While only 14% say the newsmeat are too conservative, these people must have never discovered Fox News Channel yet, huh? They haven't found it yet.

[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:51.380]
These perceptions of liberal inflation have not changed over the last three years. A majority, and they must not have been watching the news during the Operation Iraqi Freedom Business on MSNBC and certainly not news network and all these others because all of the fawning and the flag waving and the ass sucking was just, I guess, my imagination.

[00:56:52.620 --> 00:57:03.880]
These perceptions of liberal inflation haven't changed over the last three years. A majority of Americans who describe their political views as conservative perceive liberal leanings in the media while only about a third of self-described liberals perceive conservative leanings.

[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:11.360]
See, the problem in America isn't conservative, boys and girls. The problem is everybody else liberals, moderates, independence. That's the problem.

[00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:17.480]
I realize that politics sucks and it's boring and everybody much rather worried about getting some free Marlon tickets and getting laid a couple of times.

[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:25.180]
But the bottom line is that it's the other people who are sitting back on her ass while people like Arnold and everybody else is like in a feeding frenzy now.

[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:33.860]
They've goose-step their way right there in broad daylight, right in Dave County. Let us in. Let us in. They stole the guy demolition right there in front of your post with a help of their hired paid hedgehogs.

[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:45.420]
They've been on the Supreme Court. It is absolutely unbelievable is what it is. How there can be so many stupid people, 270 million people. How many people in IQ larger than their thumb? How many things?

[00:57:45.520 --> 00:58:03.380]
About 30,000. Maybe 30,000. 5,670, 560. What's the most horrifying death scene ever in the movies are? We'll keep this on for a while, because I like the way we're getting that response. Don't you?

[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:33.300]

[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.900]
judgment is clouded by all the pressure and hysteria and psychosis that's going

[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:17.280]
on in that building oh what the which one on here most of which is of course being

[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:23.980]
spread by yeah what nothing well that's where most of the psychosis in a

[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.940]
staring at building gets generated and whipped up because of and his emotional

[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:31.560]
breakdowns which happen like every day every hour on the hour although we

pull 405 votes I am so proud and pleased which of these statements do most

[01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:03.420]
strongly believe Americans are poorly educated 36.7% of this crowd that's

[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:13.380]
149 people say yeah they say right or a scout would say right now I'm ashamed

[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:18.460]
to be an American 92 22.7% America is still the greatest country in the world

[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:23.460]
87 21.4% can't they don't want to be confused by the facts Neal is

[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:27.740]
anti-American 41 10.1% is again I put myself in a position of being a human

[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.560]
punching bag and I don't mind because I've had 30 years experience how many

[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.880]
and Americans don't give a shmit about politics 36 because obviously if they

[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:39.780]
did we wouldn't have the what's the title they could openheimer they could open

[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:44.960]
fewer yeah the group and high knee the group and fewer wouldn't be the governor

[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.700]
of California today regardless of what an asshole great Davis what see again I

[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.540]
don't blame them I blame the Democrats what kind of a candidate is the city of

[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:57.960]
Cruz-Bus de Monte yeah what a joke that is always the same old crap man you

[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:02.260]

Arnold won by over million votes last night over a crew the city of Cruz-Bus de

[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:25.440]
Monte over Jose and Freddie Cruz 1.2 million I think it won by like 3.5 the 2.3

[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.800]
something like that in fact if I wasn't so lazy and I went to the CNN website

[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:34.120]
nobody cares how they do because it's got the updated number on there if I can

[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:41.660]

[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:27.000]
chin Jeb Bush is a rocket scientist he's a genius compared to what they got in

[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:30.340]
California yeah you notice with all those millions of votes last night they got

[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:48.160]
hanging chads and hanging fads and cats and a few moms and dads

[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:55.780]

[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:03.620]
Arnold's got the big nads 26 past 11 let's just look how embarrassing that is to

[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:06.460]
Florida the fact they got like millions and millions and they had like over a

[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:12.060]
70% turnout they broke all records last night drug and a turnout because

[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:15.560]
they're pissed off and fired up at Gray Davis and they had the honor they had a

[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:22.200]
big move the terminator but more could you want what a combination even at

[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:28.300]
that what is that place where I have the poison meat check in the box check in

[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:33.500]
a box they never had a combo plate like that now here's a fact that says what

[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:37.340]
happened to Ferrell this morning is Greg Reed trying to censor him I guess he

[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:40.820]
likes to screw with the talent of QM remember Joe Rosen says Greg Reed you are an

[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:44.180]
asshole but there's a lot a lot of heavy duty crap going on I'm not gonna get

[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:47.180]
stuck in the middle of it okay because I already sacrificed two years of my

[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:51.680]
life some years back and had to go through all kinds of hell and crap and I'm all

[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:55.480]
for Ferrell I stand by him on a 98% except for the 2% where he don't know where to

[01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:01.840]
draw the line that's that's my comment amen just yes I said amen yeah that's

[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.240]
right we're all behind your Ferrell but just you know tone it down a little bit

[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.420]

prophecy that thing in the her way tool Kevin Baxter that he has this

[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.080]
propensity to go and self-destruct all the time and blow up like a

[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.780]

been your favorite death scene of all time if the guy would have died but he's

[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:33.040]
still alive how do you like that drag them off the stage like a rag doll but he's

[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.860]
still alive and he's given the thumbs up in the high five in the high sign and

[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:41.420]
the high sign a scary and effective that scene is Casey Becker is Drew

[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:44.680]
Barramore murder with the beginning of screen but I was very appropriate that

[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:47.900]

the oh I see that's the scene put your mouth on the curve yeah see this is a

[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:31.200]
little bit complicated which is why I'm not right to done because I'm too whipped

Louise Fletcher in the movie Brainstorm with Chris Walker and Natalie Wood

[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:15.800]
Somebody says for our list

[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.480]
Alright, I sent it along

[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:18.460]
Is that a good movie?

[01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:19.660]
Yeah, it's okay

[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:23.780]
But it sounds so sensational

[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.300]
Who was it horrifying?

[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:26.540]
But whatever

[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:27.460]
Whatever they say

[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.760]
Well, the poll question is what was the most horrifying death scene ever in a movie?

[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:32.840]
Who were we to argue with them?

[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.200]
Yeah, who the hell are you?

[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.320]
To argue with them

[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:39.760]
Natalie Wood's somebody who, as she got older, she looked great

[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:40.960]
Who's that?

[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:41.800]
Natalie Wood

[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:44.020]
Well, she didn't get too old

[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:49.140]
See, if she would have had the same skills as Sheridan on passion, she'd probably still be alive today

[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:50.020]
But very what?

[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:52.180]
But a little on a moist side, yeah

[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:54.380]
Well, that's how most of you guys want them on a moist side

[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:56.380]
5,670560

Count 560 on the AT&T

See, I haven't voted yet

[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.920]
I'm kind of like in the catch 22 here, you know

[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:09.360]
I haven't voted because my choice, which I don't even know what my choice would be

[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.200]
But if you're as many of these, I'll pick something

[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:11.720]
It's just one of them

[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:13.580]
Father Karrison the exorcist

[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:18.080]
I mean, that was like kind of nasty when he went to ploppin down his stairs there

[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:20.280]
And his head kind of like twisted around and asked backward

[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:24.180]
But by that time we'd, by that time in a movie we'd seen so much

[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:27.060]
Gore and cut some slime and puke that

[01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:28.960]
It didn't really make that much, it was kind of anti-correct

[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.260]
Right, we were a little jaded by that

[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:30.940]
Yeah

[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:33.760]
But I'm not saying that that's not a good choice

[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:37.220]
Because then Shron who said it's the pull, who get all, you know, bent out of shape, stuff like that

[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:38.920]
All I want to ask you

[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:41.440]
Tell me, why you do this to me?

[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:44.260]
And Raiders of the Lost Ark I didn't see

[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:47.100]
Please tell me, I'm afraid

[01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:49.440]
Yeah, I mean, that was more cool than horrifying

[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:52.420]
In pale priest in the omen, I did see that

[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:54.880]
I guess I'll vote for that even though it would not be my choice

[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:56.020]
It was, you know

[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:57.340]
It was okay

[01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:59.260]
What about in the godfather, any of the three?

[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.520]
A lot of people got murdered but I don't think there was any horrifying death scene

[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:03.160]
Even more good

[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.540]
Someone was pretty fun

[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.300]
You mean when they turned them in like walking Swiss cheese

[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:09.680]

It was it was a great scene was it horrifying and first of all he didn't kill three men in a restaurant

[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:14.720]
He killed two you know the stuff you find on the internet is very aggravating

[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:18.380]
He didn't kill no three men in that and Luanne Louise in the Bronx

[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:23.120]
He killed Celotsilla he killed McCluskey only two okay

[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:29.040]
Isn't that pathetic goes to show you when you look at stuff on the internet like ask a lot of questions, okay?

[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:32.720]

So there's a good list there's 50 more so this list we got today is gonna be gigantic

[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:58.700]
So I'll just vote for one just to see how things are going okay

[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:01.780]
On before Eric leaves

[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:06.920]
I'll vote for the impaled priest in the omen even though I don't believe that for a moment

[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:10.260]

[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.600]

[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:49.640]
I told you tonight right at the outset. I knew it has more by psychic powers kicking in

[01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:53.520]
It's beginning to get them kicked in the butt if you got a big fat butt

[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:57.340]
And the rest of you is pretty like out of gigantic overhang. Here's the answer for you balance for life

[01:32:57.340 --> 01:32:59.180]

A psychic event number six. He just waddled in and waddled out and what do you say? I think you scared him off did he say?

[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:11.960]
I'm fat and ugly and gross he said I can't

[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:16.700]
And can't get laid well anyway, maybe you guys out there would like to get laid fat guys

[01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:20.220]
Don't get laid nearly as much as guys who look a little bit better. Okay, I'd say that right now

[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:26.500]
Balance for life can help you lose the weight forget about all those other diets that make you go shopping and count calories and count

[01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:29.960]
Carbs and do all kinds of stuff like all over the place with balance for life

[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:35.560]
There's no work on your part it makes it easy even if you're like lazy stupid or combination of both because it's all based on the

[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.420]
Principles of the zone diet by Dr.

Once a week you fill out a menu in fact balance for life is the only company in the universe that lets you choose between two choices for each one of your meals

[01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:04.560]

[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:09.880]
It's delicious. It's made with the best ingredients

[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:15.280]
You'll be astonished at the gourmet nature of the kind of stuff that they bring in so instead of trying some drastic crazy

[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:20.080]
Dirt regimen that makes you more frustrated and we want to gain in more weight do this balance for life

Don't wish speaking a dog child. What is this from what dog track is this?

[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:23.060]
Like somebody sends me a page and the dogs are all named Jim Manditz Lamar Smith, Brock Merriand, Run Ricky Run, Hank Goldberg, Curly Howard

[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:25.500]
They've won stat and trace Armstrong

[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:31.240]
All these dogs. I'm assuming this is a legitimate race at the somewhere. I don't know if this is it

[01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:33.180]
Not yeah, but it's not a biscuit

[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:36.660]
Er

[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:43.720]
There ain't no biscuit dummy at any rate so it must be flagler. How what am I talking about must be faggler

[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:48.220]
Here's a fact that says the most horrifying death scene in a movie with near the end of casino

[01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:53.800]
Where the mobsters take batting practice with Joe peshi and his brother in a cornfield and bury them alive or more

[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:58.320]
Accurately not quite dead this baseball bat scene makes the one the untouchable look like say

[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:02.480]
Look like Sesame Street. It's also factually true

[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:04.040]
Oscar Goodman

[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:08.780]
The lawyer and current mayor of Las Vegas represented the character portrayed by peshi

[01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:14.780]
He stated that he believes that the FBI had that cornfield under observance for the mobsters meeting and witnessed what happened

[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:18.360]
But didn't do nothing to stop it kind like when father gagan got his in the prison

[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:20.860]
It had the same idea

[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:26.220]
Speaking of burying alive. Oh, yeah, right on a completely different level

[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:31.540]
There is the ending of the vanishing the Dutch French original version not the shmiddi American remake remake very

[01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:35.940]
Psychologically disturbing although not physically repulsive like casino. They had the vanishings very good

[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:41.160]
I'm gonna have to go and see if I can get that the European version. Yeah. Oh, you you're talking about the American virgin

[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:43.620]
I beg your pardon

[01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:48.400]
Which one were you talking about is being very good the American to the European? No the European one. Oh, yes

[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.880]
Yes, because that's how both no the American one blow it

[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:54.660]
But then again see that's my anti-Americanism coming out again in it

[01:37:54.660 --> 01:38:00.120]
I'm just anti-neil and anti-American and just a fag and just a bad guy and everybody listen to the show

[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:07.040]
16 votes for American history x is that something out of you watching it ain't bad

[01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:29.340]

Planet something like that somebody will absolutely know all right. Thanks a lot of power. Thanks for the good news by the way

[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:13.520]
I'm delighted about that

[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:19.100]
What was that an obnoxious show and all to see? There's another example of the poor taste of the American public review

[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:24.220]
Just gigantic. Oh, you know, that's a good pull. I think I just hit the mother load

[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:30.820]
Oh, did you see this woman's vote in the candidates even the women 42 the 37 voted for Schwarzenegger against boostimony

[01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:36.940]
42 the 37% and men overwhelming because it's the Terminator. It's Arnold

[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:41.920]
And the men can relate to macho on his bodybuilder. He's a not a girly man

[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:45.160]
Although he did do a lot of guys once about a time, but that's beside the point

[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:47.540]
That's back before he met Maria with no chin

[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:51.380]
Isn't interesting they were like three of them up on a podium and two of them didn't have a chin

[01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:57.740]
Jaleno Maria and Arnold actually he don't have no chin no mo either

[01:41:58.260 --> 01:41:59.700]
He looks like a dottering old

[01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:01.420]
Crout is what he looks like to me

[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:07.340]
56705 60 pound 560 on the 18 and T and Verizon live was the most horrifying

[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:08.520]
Death scene

[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:10.740]
Ever in a movie is our poll question today

[01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:16.740]
We had that earlier poll and it was a phenomenal a spectacular Latino vote on candidates to be placed Davis

[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:22.320]
Cruz a Cita Cruz boost about a 52% Arnold got 30% even of them a beaners out there

[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:24.620]
Not good not too good Cruz

[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:27.040]
WQ I am

[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:30.200]
Yes, hello. Yes, sir

[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:32.180]
I want to talk to Neil speaking

[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:34.420]
Neil Larry my am

[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:34.840]
Hey Larry

[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:36.480]
Pleasure to meet you

[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:41.180]
Uh or here for me. I want to tell you the most horrific scene I've seen in the movie

[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:43.860]
It's final final destination

[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:48.020]
And that's the bus scene I don't know if that's what that one was the mentioned

[01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:49.820]
Did we have that George?

[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:55.720]
We have one or two criminal definition already. I'm choking on bacon. He's choking on bacon

[01:42:55.720 --> 01:43:02.580]
I mean, I've seen bad things but that is like you see the person walking front and then you just imagine that thing

[01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:04.840]
smack and everybody it's blurred it

[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:09.180]
Yeah, just see it to believe it. It's a great thing. Let's get it down George. We got it down man. Thanks

[01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:13.900]
You're talking to me. I'll thank you. Thank you. Thank for you have a great life. Nice. I'll call you again

[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:19.840]
Five zero. What they're like 50 death scenes and final destination. They're all gruesome

[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.740]
Well, he's for his and you should be putting it down and not giving him a bunch of lip is what you should be doing right now

[01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:27.520]
There's Arnold in America having arrived here

[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:29.840]
um in the 1960s as a

[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:33.400]
impoverished immigrant who had nothing but his bodybuilding skills

[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.620]
He was a big success in this country

[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:40.600]
And of course the focus and discipline of what's necessary to become a successful bodybuilding

[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:45.100]
You've been on a lot of drive and the voters saw him as someone

[01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:52.360]
Well, yeah, isn't that amazing Bill Schneider right now trying to rationalize what they did as if the voters really had this tremendous respect

[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:58.520]
And admiration for Arnold based on something legitimate because he came here as a penniless immigrant yada yada yada

[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:00.900]
Partridge up your paratory. Oh god

[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:07.020]
CNN needs to be they need to be off the area, you know what somebody needs to like get them off the air

[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:14.240]
And I mean fox at least they're not making any pretence. They lie a lot but we know what they are and they're like a laugh at you

[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:17.540]
But CNN they smirk they smirk

[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:22.140]
We're gonna have goddamn Bill Schneider is on her smirk and now he can't say it with a straight face

[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:28.440]
Anyone who see what his last name is Schneider uh-huh crowd you want kind of a crowd went in doubt. It's another crowd

[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:30.840]
Let's kick him out

[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.620]
No doubt about right, Mo

[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:35.080]
Absolutely how's Mo doing

[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:42.300]
Fine probably rubbing his legs together like a grasshopper like a cricket like buddy Holly

[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:47.920]
Here's another list. Well, let's see Charleston Lottordale beat says I have an excellent idea for your next pool

[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:50.220]
You can call the pool just die already

[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:53.280]
Like that

[01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:57.160]
As in which dead celebrity would you want to just go away?

[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:01.920]
What was the great pool idea had moments ago that I forgot already? I forgot to as in deck open viewer

[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:07.920]
Uh, yeah yesterday two new albums from Elvis and two pack came out

[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.520]
I'm sick and tired of hearing two pack crap from seven years ago

[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:14.600]
I'm sure a mobile appreciate this pool and I know George's vote would be Roy Horn

[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:21.320]
Just die already. I'm gonna put that in my pile of possible polls for the future your poll pile. Let's go back to the future

[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:26.240]
I got a pile of pools better than Paul pot. Here's one from Alex who just can't stop

[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:30.920]
He can't control himself because he figures one of these days. He'll set us the facts that we actually like and you know

[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:37.100]
Deep rising were the guys digested live by the creature cheesy movie better gross scene. Do we know that?

[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:43.600]
No, no, well get it on there the scene in jaws where Robert Choggets eaten

[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:45.920]
We have that don't we?

[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:49.520]
I like the one where Ron Jeremy eats himself

[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:56.140]
The alien popping out of the man's chair. We already got them the scene where the guys cut up by let's see

[01:45:56.140 --> 01:46:01.080]
Alex always puts on stuff that we he knows we've already got just to be a because he's an asshole and he's proud of it

[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:04.720]
The scene where the guys cut up by laser beams in resident evil

[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:05.760]
Oh

[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:13.340]
Okay lasers the the scene where blade Wesley snipes cuts Ron from on a half of the sword blade two is the movie

[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:18.260]
Alex also says how about some Eisner Mickey bits to see Alex

[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:24.400]
We're doing fairly well not great, but fairly well to just start like programming the show that really frost my ass

[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:29.000]
Oh, here's some more verification of the thing I was telling you about although nobody cares

[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:33.860]
Schwarzenegger total amnesia and Ron emails show Arnold met with Ken lay during the energy crisis

[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:37.300]
Say consumer group. I'll save this for after the break. Okay, okay?

[01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:39.240]
Because I've got just one story out of somebody's

[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:42.460]
Some columnist imagination or some crap that one

[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:45.600]
Ojan provocateur made up. It's the freaking truth

[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:49.260]
But don't confuse the confused the voters of California with this

[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:55.420]
Oh brother, it's scary really is yesterday last night was the night that america

[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:58.500]
That was it that was the last day of the coffin of all used to be america

We used to love and be proud of and hope would a resurrected self. No, ain't gonna happen

Got my team at five sixty WQM. So here's this that we just got from the US newswire. What is that California US?

[01:49:44.960 --> 01:50:09.500]
US newswire

[01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:19.020]
Shortsneaker had previously said he doesn't remember such a meeting

[01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:24.780]
You don't meet with america's most well-known corporate cook in the middle of California's biggest financial disaster

[01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:28.460]
And not remember set up TCR senior consumer antica Douglas Keller

[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:29.320]
Mr

[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:34.220]
Shortsneaker should come clean about what happened at the meeting and if he shares can lays views on energy regulation

[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:39.960]
The documents provide list of invitees to the hastily arranged meeting and list of those who actually attended

[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:47.440]
Only 11 of the 45 invitees attended including Arnold the meeting was meant to be an opportunity to gain business community support for

[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:47.960]
Enron's

[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:53.320]
Comprehensive solution to the energy crisis in one email enron's VP of public relations wrote

[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:58.760]
We like to position this meeting as an insider's conversation of what's going on with the energy situation

[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:01.240]
This meeting should be for principles only

[01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:08.060]
FTCR contends that enron policies are responsible for these severe energy crisis in California in

[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:16.240]
2001 the group noted that the crisis had dramatic implications on the state economy in state budget and will continue to impact consumers for years to come

[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:19.700]
FTCR is called for a repeal of the deregulation and supported

[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:24.980]
state bill 8883 to re-regulate the state's electricity system

[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:30.200]
FTCR has been critical of enron's involvement in the California energy crisis in which the company developed schemes for an

[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:33.500]
manipulating the power market that forced massive price spikes in the state

[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:38.340]
Since it apparently was important enough for sports negative attend despite the last minute notice

[01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:46.040]
Schwartz-Negger should now explain what happened at his meeting with enron's Kenny Boyley and whether or not he supports electricity re-regulation hellers said

[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:53.480]
Yada yada yada ftcr is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization which doesn't support a repose candidates for any office and had no position on the

[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:57.680]
California recall how do you like that? So there it is there's the third source we got on that

[01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:00.260]
because it is absolutely true sir

[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:03.500]
but don't confuse anybody with the facts

[01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:08.760]
ah who cares right nobody obviously just like our second pull nobody cares and maybe they haven't found

[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:11.260]

Psychic is at number seven, just to place.

[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:45.880]

[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:45.980]
Yes.

[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:47.380]
What?

[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:51.280]
I was making fun of Spanish speaking people on TV and you played that, that liner.

[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:53.200]
I like that.

[01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:55.280]
Oh, speaking of people who talk funny.

[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:59.540]
I'm Eastern back on the East Coast of the United States.

[01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:04.500]
A lot of Democrats are probably breathing a lot easier today knowing that this Kennedy clan,

[01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:06.800]
at least a big chunk of them are on board.

[01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:13.100]
Well, there's no doubt that that makes people feel better about where Arnold's real political soul lies.

[01:59:13.460 --> 01:59:17.060]
But again, it really comes back to how Schwarzenegger is.

[01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:18.880]
What the hell are these people talking about?

[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:21.220]
Yeah, that's certainly not news now.

[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:21.600]
We forgot.

[01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:22.440]
That was Wolflet's Creek.

[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:24.660]
Is that the Great of L?

[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:25.040]
Yeah.

[01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:26.820]
Their open viewer.

[01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:29.460]
Court ruling clears FTC.

[01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:30.300]
Do not call this.

[01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:31.020]
Here's some good news.

[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:31.400]
Okay.

[01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:32.560]
I don't want to leave you without good news.

[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:34.100]
We got our big one to comedy bit ours.

[01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:35.520]
We're like, short on time.

[01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:41.180]
Americans get again signed up for the national do not call this to fend off unwanted phone solicitations.

[01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:46.160]
After a federal appeals court allowed the government to fully punish errant telemarketers at least for now.

[01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:49.300]
And like I told you yesterday, the phones have stopped ringing in my house.

[01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:49.980]
Hallelujah.

[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:51.880]
No more.

[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:58.320]
With all those and boy, I don't know whether it was me or well, that's because I'm on like 80 million credit cards and all this other crap.

[01:59:58.320 --> 01:59:59.720]
I'm probably on every damn list going.

[01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:01.440]
But not no more.

[02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:02.780]
No more damn.

[02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:04.160]
No more.

[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:05.160]
No more.

[02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:05.420]
No more.

[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:11.020]
The 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals yesterday temporarily blocked a lower court order barring the FTC from enforcing the registry.

[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:13.240]
A more than 50 million numbers.

[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:16.560]
50 million Americans, even as dumb as we may be, can't all be wrong.

[02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:24.560]
The Supreme Court has held that there is undoubtedly a substantial government interest in the prevention of abusive and coercive sales practices through ruling B.S.A.N.

[02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:34.720]
The court requested the conclusions of US district judge Edward Nottingham of Denver who said the list violates the telemarketing industry's free speech rights by barring calls from businesses but not charities.

[02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:41.460]
It also noted that Congress had found some telemarketing calls subject to consumers to substantial fraud, deception and abuse.

[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:41.980]
Oy!

[02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:51.260]
FTC chairman Timothy Murriss called the latest ruling a victory for American consumers and said his agency will return to enforcing the list to which we say,

[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:52.300]
ORIGHT!

[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:56.760]
The FCC had stepped in and last minute-tannel enforcement along the registry to take effect last week.

[02:00:56.980 --> 02:00:58.340]
Yada yada yada yada.

[02:00:58.340 --> 02:00:59.860]
The court fight isn't finished though.

[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:05.620]
The appeal court said the FTC can run the registry while a challenge from telemarketers winds its way through the courts.

[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:12.740]
Oral and anal arguments were scheduled in Tulsa, Oklahoma, November 10th and of course in Oklahoma they're too happy about those oral or anal.

[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:14.660]
If he asks me, you think?

[02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:15.660]
Probably not.

[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:17.760]
So, charities are exempt from this?

[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:21.420]
The court is exempt, she's busy saving Osheriden from a sure fate.

[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:22.480]
What kind of crime is that?

[02:01:23.900 --> 02:01:27.180]
If you'd start watching passions, you'd start catching onto the good stuff.

[02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:27.520]
Okay?

[02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:35.620]
You'd see Edna Wallace on there and you'd laugh your ass off her and precious and the Agata Mishbaja and Charlie, Charlie the Bulldyke?

[02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:41.480]
Who wants to take poor Beth away like live a life of lust and licking of forever?

[02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:42.880]
Who wants to get her licks?

[02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:45.700]
Speaking of that, what a great segue again!

[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:55.700]
The president of Loyola University in New Orleans resigned yesterday after he was accused of sexual misconduct while he was at a Jesuit prep school in Indianapolis in 1986.

[02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:58.700]
Well, it must be just another isolated incident, don't you think?

[02:01:58.860 --> 02:01:59.120]
Of course.

[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:11.460]
The Reverend Bernard Noth, a Jesuit priest submitted his resignation to the Roman Catholic College under new church rules that say if a sexual allegation involving a minor is deemed credible, the accused should be removed immediately if not sooner.

[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:13.440]
Noth, I think I'm going to fart.

[02:02:13.900 --> 02:02:14.700]
Oh, I just...

[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:15.560]
Oh, Jesus!

[02:02:16.060 --> 02:02:16.640]
Did you hear that?

[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:17.000]
Yeah.

[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:17.540]
No, seriously.

[02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:18.280]
No, I didn't hear it.

[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:19.440]
I can smell it though.

[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:21.320]
Good.

[02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:22.420]
Oh, man.

[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:28.280]
Noth, president of Loyola, since 1995, issued a statement denying any inappropriate conduct.

[02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:31.180]
The Reverend William J. Byron was named acting president.

[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:35.580]
He was dean at Loyola in the 70s and writes a syndicated column for the Catholic news service.

[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:37.320]
Byron said that...

[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:38.700]
Oh, you're right, it stinks, man.

[02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:45.300]
Byron said that if the allegations are proven, this is another event in a series of tragic events that comprise the greatest crisis the church has had to deal with.

[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:51.740]
He said, no student at Loyola has ever brought sexual allegations against Noth, a statement from the Jesuit orders Chicago...

[02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:56.960]
Chicago Province said the sexual encounter allegedly happened at the Breeb-Boof Jesuit Prep School.

[02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:58.140]
Breeb-Boof?

[02:02:58.280 --> 02:02:58.900]
The Breeb-Boof?

[02:02:59.000 --> 02:02:59.680]
Breeb-Boof.

[02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:07.660]
Byron didn't say when a complaint was made but apparently recently the statement issued in Chicago said the complaint triggered an immediate investigation.

[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:11.800]
Kisaland away with view board which found the allegations to be credible.

[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:12.800]
How do you like that?

[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:13.400]
Oh, right.

[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:14.480]
He done it.

[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:15.560]
He done the deed.

[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:22.660]
56670560, so far at our pool, curb stomping murder in American history acts as leading with 35.

[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:25.400]
The chainsaw scene in Scarface right on the RASDA with 31.

[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:30.240]
Alien eruption 18, shower scene, psycho 17, the impale priest in the Oman Lovett.

[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:32.300]
A lot of people waiting for theirs to come up on here.

[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:36.680]
Like when Eric gets his other 5,000 on there, 137 votes is all we got in the so far.

[02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:41.480]
One of these pages and pages you're faxing here is one from Mike.

[02:03:41.980 --> 02:03:55.120]
How about the scene in saving Pride Ryan when that Nazi in the American soldier in that fight sequence in an upstairs tower and the German soldier slowly grabs that technical hunting knife through his chest while whispering to the American to hush as if he were telling him to die quietly.

[02:03:55.740 --> 02:03:56.720]
Like he wanted to kill him lightly.

[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:04.360]
If that didn't top off, remember his friend, I see, his pussy friend, we can say that.

[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:08.900]
Hiding under the staircase, crying in the background, you hear his buddy slowly dying in gurgling blood.

[02:04:09.140 --> 02:04:11.560]
Ooh, Mike, we got that on there?

[02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:13.420]
Like, yeah, nothing I think.

[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:15.540]
Not seeing I've been saving Pride Ryan.

[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:19.420]
Oh no, what is this?

[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:23.520]
About Rush Limbaugh and all these how many more pages?

[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:24.560]
About third man.

[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:27.200]
Two, of course you will not be forwarding.

[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:30.940]
I can't afford to be chopping down oak trees here in Toronto, okay?

[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:39.580]
Kathy, a left handed Democrat says $14.7 million raised this quarter, $77 average donation.

[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:41.540]
Are you any more convinced about Howard Dean?

[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:43.680]
What does that mean?

[02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:44.860]
About Howard Dean.

[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:45.640]
I don't know.

[02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:47.220]
She must not think you like it.

[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:48.300]
I love Howard Dean.

[02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:49.060]
That's my man.

[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:50.080]
That's my main man.

[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:51.220]
Is Howard Dean, Kathy?

[02:04:51.380 --> 02:04:52.220]
What do you be talking about?

[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:53.900]
PS, forget God of Fawnear.

[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.380]
Rumor has a Graham will be on Dean's ticket for Vice President.

[02:04:56.720 --> 02:04:57.500]
I like that.

[02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:58.660]
Sure works for me.

[02:04:59.160 --> 02:04:59.800]
Dean and Graham.

[02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:01.000]
Howie and Bobby.

[02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:02.920]
I like it.

[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:03.920]
I don't understand.

[02:05:04.060 --> 02:05:05.600]
She says hemfax since May.

[02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:07.880]
Well, Kathy, I know you're arguing you're a preaching of the choir.

[02:05:08.620 --> 02:05:10.660]
She says the chainsaw scene in Scarface.

[02:05:10.660 --> 02:05:11.780]
Eek is what she says.

[02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:12.160]
Yeah.

[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:14.040]
Not only people in cartoons said Eek.

[02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:16.280]
Was the Colombian chainsaw massacre?

[02:05:17.180 --> 02:05:17.880]
Like Boohoo.

[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:20.380]
Right?

[02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:26.280]
There are certain expressions and sayings that nobody in real life actually says only in cartoons.

[02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:27.480]
Eek is one of them.

[02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:28.820]
Boohoo is another one.

[02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:30.160]
You ever say Boohoo?

[02:05:30.700 --> 02:05:31.420]
Not lately.

[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:36.480]
That's what everybody knows Greg Rito always says Boohoo when he hears name mentioned.

[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:40.080]
Michael, you just said that I'll be telling you just the first part.

[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:44.200]
Here's a message from Tracy and Kendall.

[02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:51.440]
I don't know if you recall in Devolution Man when Sandra Bullock talks about the future when restaurants will all be Taco Bell and Arnold will be president.

[02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:53.540]
It was funny then, but it's scary now.

[02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:54.580]
Good point, Tracy.

[02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:55.320]
How about that?

[02:05:57.120 --> 02:06:09.120]
All restaurants will be Taco Bells and Arnold will be president and will all be wearing hip boots and goose stepping and singing Deutschland Uber Aless for their group.

[02:06:09.220 --> 02:06:10.060]
Their group and fewer.

[02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:12.860]
I'm starting to catch out of that now.

[02:06:12.940 --> 02:06:13.860]
I love it.

[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:14.940]
Their group and fewer.

[02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:17.120]
Anybody.

[02:06:17.560 --> 02:06:21.160]
Now see what's we get the other ones on it and then we'll have like Zidians of votes, but they're all waiting.

[02:06:21.320 --> 02:06:22.200]
They're like laying back.

[02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:25.980]
My life and look all this is for 205.

[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:34.200]
I can tell now when the motifs in lifted up my skirt.

[02:06:34.340 --> 02:06:38.680]
He said, I'm like a cow.

[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:46.420]
I'm a rule Republican.

[02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:49.540]
One Sancamonious Christian.

[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:55.300]
My colleagues have a thing where we pull up ranks.

[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:59.540]
And dress up like we're all sister-hars.

[02:07:00.060 --> 02:07:07.400]
We'll tell you what's just and right and how to run your life because our moral ground is so much higher.

[02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:13.260]
And we'll decide what you should think while dressed in things.

[02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:20.360]
As we rinse the nuts off, you can't buy us where she can't be trained to stand.

[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:27.560]
Here in the hats of American, as in a strange song.

[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:41.040]
We support our dick and bush and stay on twist of medias in our control.

[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:47.040]
Sometimes John Astral comes around and pulls his pants down.

[02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:49.880]
Or else the put our tongues up his bonnet.

[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:53.960]
Back them in a cheap old piece, transvestite.

[02:07:56.120 --> 02:08:01.440]
In a hat of American, in a strange song.

[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:14.600]
I would you hope the transvestite is in a hat of American, and in a strange song.

[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:21.820]
Speaking of kissing the old brown eye, I don't forget tomorrow morning, it's Thursday, 6.45.

[02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:25.560]
Mohawar Davidd puts the old tongue, the old insert into J. Feeler.

[02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:26.160]
Absolutely.

[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:27.140]
And pumps him up.

[02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:29.120]
Time to pump everybody up, don't you think?

[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:33.120]
Your husband's or wives agenda.

[02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:37.020]
I thought she was incredibly impressive on the campaign stump.

[02:08:39.860 --> 02:08:41.120]
Oh, man, Wolf Blitzkrieg.

[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:44.960]
He's already drinking his beer by the gallon.

[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:48.260]
What a bunch of crap.

[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:53.280]
Here's a fact that says when I fasted in May about howardine you said you liked him, but that would never happen.

[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:54.520]
Well, what's going to happen?

[02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:55.700]
Well, guess what, Kathy?

[02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:56.980]
A crap happens, okay?

[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:00.880]
Now she's going to say, oh, you're calling him crap, now I just said crap happens.

[02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:03.440]
Stop being so uptight, Kathy, and have a wonderful day.

[02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:11.380]
Here's Aaron in Palmetto Bay, who rhymes with day and gay, who says I want to add the scene from Devil's Atticab, advocate where Keanu Reeves wife.

[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:13.780]
Slowly, Slitzer, throw with a piece of glass.

[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:17.860]
And of course, if you ladies out there were married to Keanu Reeves, you'd probably do the same thing.

[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:21.820]
The movie was very weak, but that scene left nothing to the imagination.

[02:09:22.260 --> 02:09:26.600]
Also, could either you or George please tell me to them for that infectious Celia Cruz song.

[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:30.820]
Now I assume the one he's talking about is the one that goes like...

[02:09:44.700 --> 02:09:46.700]
Please spell a bit of it as I know no Spanish.

[02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:47.880]
AZUCAR.

[02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:48.800]
That's not the name of it.

[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:52.140]
He said please spell a bit of it, he didn't say...

[02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:56.900]
Oh no, Jesus Christ George, Man Tarot, you and Kathy ought to be getting it on.

[02:09:57.060 --> 02:10:00.660]
I mean, there's something, maybe you could like instill something to each other.

[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:01.340]
What does she look like?

[02:10:03.420 --> 02:10:04.100]
Kathy, baits.

[02:10:04.460 --> 02:10:05.560]
And anyway, so what's the deal?

[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:06.820]
Celia Cruz, what's the name of the song?

[02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:08.560]
La negra, tiene tumbala.

[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:10.480]
I beg your pardon?

[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:11.340]
Yes, she does.

[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:13.520]
LA, Negro.

[02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:14.680]
N-E-G-R-A, Negro.

[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:15.820]
N-E-G-R.

[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:17.780]
Just like it sounds, that's Spanish, man.

[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:18.900]
Spell the spart sounds.

[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:20.380]
Yeah, Tien it.

[02:10:20.380 --> 02:10:26.300]
So you say spart sound again and all the russian was that the quarterback Donovan McNabb.

[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:31.800]
Yeah, is that before after he popped the oxies, cotton.

[02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:34.600]
Here's some suggestions for today's poll.

[02:10:34.820 --> 02:10:37.200]
Tony in Dear Field says the lust murder from seven.

[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:40.940]
I'm sure there are a lot, I saw seven many times.

[02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:43.340]
Some of these things I don't recall.

[02:10:43.340 --> 02:10:48.760]
Because the other, the scene where he says, what's in the box is overwhelmed me so much, you know?

[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.500]
Just because it's his wife's head.

[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:53.380]
Or anybody who saw it, I guess I just ruined it for you.

[02:10:53.700 --> 02:10:55.400]
It's Brad Pitt's wife's head is in the box.

[02:10:55.820 --> 02:10:56.760]
Oh, no.

[02:10:57.500 --> 02:10:57.900]
What?

[02:10:58.920 --> 02:10:59.940]
You just ruined it.

[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:00.480]
Yeah.

[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:02.900]
Don't you think it's been out long enough?

[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:03.820]
No, it's so obvious.

[02:11:04.140 --> 02:11:09.420]
That same guy, that's like saying Bella LaGosie gets the stake through the heart in the end from Professor Bon Helsing at the end of Dracula.

[02:11:09.420 --> 02:11:10.700]
Goddamn you.

[02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:15.720]
Yeah, but look, he made a lot of other Dracula movies after that.

[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:16.340]
So he made a call.

[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:19.680]
The role knows it's deeply disturbing.

[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:25.540]
The Maria Schraber, I was just reading an email, but they moved it too quick about ripping her an ass about becoming a turn code in the supporting her husband, Arnold.

[02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:26.360]
Good facts.

[02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:27.560]
Whoever that was or email, whatever.

[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:29.500]
Kevin, you got that one down?

[02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:31.560]
What the Kevin?

[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:34.600]
Why do you want to do a girl with a huge spiked strap on?

[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:35.620]
Outch it says.

[02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:36.380]
Is it in practice?

[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:39.780]
No, you can't just write seven.

[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.960]
And is he going to actually put those other ones on there or what's the deal?

[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:45.840]
You want to get a lot of testing?

[02:11:46.620 --> 02:11:47.240]
Is he protesting?

[02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:47.740]
I don't know.

[02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:50.060]
Kevin, and maybe he's just eating.

[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:53.740]
Kevin Dillon crushing some poor sap skull with a butt of his rifle in platoon.

[02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:55.720]
He hear the sound and see the blood splattering.

[02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:57.520]
Truly sickening is what it's saying.

[02:11:57.540 --> 02:11:57.920]
Oh, right.

[02:11:57.940 --> 02:11:58.640]
That's our kind of movie.

[02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:00.400]
I never saw platoon.

[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:02.460]
I know that's what I put in this this summer.

[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:03.960]
There's so many good movies I never saw.

[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:04.860]
That's what makes it good.

[02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:07.700]
Because there's so much work to do and so little time.

[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:09.060]
Especially for good anti-war.

[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:13.240]
Russell crows two-seater into the competition move in gladiator.

[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.120]
And then Tony who was doing really well until they got to this is how could you miss the alien pop-up scene in alien?

[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:20.860]
Did we miss that?

[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:21.120]
No.

[02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:21.660]
It's on air.

[02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:23.360]
It's number three.

[02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:25.260]
And the list has got the twenty-three vote.

[02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:27.720]
So get with it, Tony.

[02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:29.300]
We're doing really well until you like a bluet.

[02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:34.460]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line.

[02:12:34.660 --> 02:12:35.200]
WQA him.

[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:35.380]
Hello.

[02:12:36.180 --> 02:12:37.140]
Mr. Rogers.

[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:37.900]
See.

[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:38.840]
Hey.

[02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:40.160]
I'm casino.

[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:41.160]
Yeah.

[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:42.720]
Joe Kaskin is brother.

[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:44.220]
They could beat up and that crazy.

[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:45.560]
Made out there with the baseball bat.

[02:12:45.660 --> 02:12:46.820]
Baseball bat and buried alive.

[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:49.620]
That's on that other extended list that Eric isn't putting on her yet.

[02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:50.880]
But he eventually got it.

[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:51.240]
All right.

[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:52.640]
Well, thank you Mr. Rogers.

[02:12:52.820 --> 02:12:53.480]
Have a nice day.

[02:12:53.700 --> 02:12:54.800]
And Oscar came to be this.

[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:55.680]
I see.

[02:12:58.260 --> 02:12:59.080]
What did he say?

[02:12:59.080 --> 02:12:59.880]
He called me a CC.

[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:02.020]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:03.160]
Maybe I'm kind of saying Francis.

[02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:03.560]
You think?

[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:05.580]
No.

[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:06.560]
Oh.

[02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:07.640]
How do you know?

[02:13:08.020 --> 02:13:09.560]
How about saying Francis?

[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:10.020]
Oh, here.

[02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:11.700]
Oh, let's do some harness racing stuff.

[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:12.140]
What do you say?

[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:12.900]
Okay.

[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:15.520]
I should probably put on the horse racing channel.

[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:16.840]
There's no harness racing at this time.

[02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:19.260]
But we're only nine minutes away from the first race at Belmont.

[02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:20.860]
And the horses are coming.

[02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:22.340]
Look at talk about psychic.

[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:26.660]
The horses are coming out of the walking ring there in the paddock.

[02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:28.100]
And they're coming out of the track.

[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:31.800]
And I bet you momentarily we'll hear the voice of the great Tom Durkin.

[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:32.420]
Old red.

[02:13:32.860 --> 02:13:33.320]
You think?

[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:35.220]
I wouldn't know.

[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:36.880]
Well, I'll just leave the pot open.

[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:38.740]
And then like if he's carrots, uh, huh?

[02:13:39.100 --> 02:13:39.760]
Leave it open.

[02:13:40.420 --> 02:13:42.480]
He'll say the horse is entering the track for the first race.

[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:43.080]
And you got it.

[02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:43.820]
Whatever he's going to say.

[02:13:45.020 --> 02:13:45.960]
Good old red.

[02:13:46.820 --> 02:13:47.660]
How's Harvey Pacto?

[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:48.220]
And then he died?

[02:13:48.380 --> 02:13:48.600]
Yes.

[02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:49.220]
Sure he's dead.

[02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:51.840]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[02:13:52.060 --> 02:13:52.780]
Pound 5 60.

[02:13:53.100 --> 02:13:54.100]
Too bad about horse racing.

[02:13:54.100 --> 02:13:55.160]
It's really, really enjoyable.

[02:13:55.340 --> 02:13:56.380]
Harness, stirbred, all that.

[02:13:56.520 --> 02:13:58.080]
Too bad that only old cockers like me.

[02:13:58.080 --> 02:13:58.560]
Go to it.

[02:13:58.680 --> 02:13:59.440]
That's the problem.

[02:13:59.620 --> 02:14:00.040]
There they are.

[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:02.060]
It took a while because it was a long list.

[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:03.600]
Oh, they popped up there.

[02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:04.700]
Oh my God.

[02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:06.100]
Do this to Eric.

[02:14:06.980 --> 02:14:08.600]
Oh, how did I do it?

[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:12.240]
You somebody faxed this to you and then you faxed it to me.

[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:15.800]
That's the way it works when I'm out of town and out of touch with what's going on inside Florida.

[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:16.520]
Point of time, Jika.

[02:14:16.900 --> 02:14:19.340]
And by the way, speaking of that, I'm so poor, uh, uh, poor Erica.

[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:20.840]
I apologize, Eric.

[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:22.020]
I don't want to ever do this to you again.

[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:23.660]
The list is so freaking long.

[02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:24.780]
There's 170 votes.

[02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:26.900]
It'll probably double in over any second.

[02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:31.960]
Because now you've got a lot of good choices on there, including the one probably that many of you have been waiting for.

[02:14:32.140 --> 02:14:32.760]
I'm so sorry.

[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:33.440]
I'm sorry.

[02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:33.920]
No.

[02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:34.920]
But it sounds pretty good.

[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:37.420]
Now, what was I just saying before you interrupted me so rudely?

[02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:38.100]
Tom Durkin.

[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:39.060]
Oh, Tom Jika.

[02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:41.820]
Or some other Tom Dick.

[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:42.300]
I'm here.

[02:14:43.020 --> 02:14:43.660]
Tom Jirkin.

[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:44.460]
Is Tom Jirkin?

[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:44.860]
Probably.

[02:14:44.980 --> 02:14:45.740]
I thought he'd hear me.

[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:47.260]
Hey, Tom, quit doing it.

[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:50.640]
And let's hear the post-broad for the first race from Belmont Park.

[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:52.000]
I don't even know if he's working today.

[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:54.920]
This could be like the day that I try to put Phil Saltsman on here.

[02:14:55.060 --> 02:14:56.340]
Not yesterday, but the other day, remember?

[02:14:56.340 --> 02:14:56.840]
No.

[02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:57.640]
He wasn't even working.

[02:14:57.920 --> 02:14:58.760]
Tom Jirkin ain't working.

[02:14:59.180 --> 02:15:00.600]
Tom is working ain't Jirkin.

[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:01.500]
What was it?

[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:03.100]
And anyway, Tom Jika is Jirkin.

[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:08.460]
Because Tom Jika, who said that I was out of touch because of the pulses of Florida, which of course is a joke in itself.

[02:15:08.940 --> 02:15:12.340]
Here's a guy that has written a local comms since before Jesus was an embryo.

[02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:14.320]
Man, oh man.

[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:15.760]
Who the hell are you, Schmidt and man?

[02:15:16.260 --> 02:15:17.060]
The Schmidt-Mistard.

[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:17.720]
Tom Jika.

[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:22.900]
All he writes is every single day when his column appears it's a puff.

[02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:24.020]
He's not, I shouldn't say that.

[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:30.560]
Let me, I didn't look today because I was too honled intensive this morning looking about all kinds of good stuff, bad stuff.

[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:32.020]
Where the hell is it?

[02:15:33.020 --> 02:15:35.080]
Where is the sunset and the website, George?

[02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:36.080]
I don't know.

[02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:39.300]
On my list, list of my least favorites.

[02:15:39.700 --> 02:15:40.280]
Oh, geez.

[02:15:42.340 --> 02:15:43.080]
There it is.

[02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:43.980]
One moment, please.

[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:44.340]
Okay.

[02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:45.300]
Horses are around.

[02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:45.840]
I don't hear nothing.

[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:46.600]
Do you hear anything?

[02:15:47.020 --> 02:15:47.900]
I don't hear Jack.

[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:49.720]
Good.

[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:54.780]
That's the best news I've heard all day.

[02:15:55.420 --> 02:15:55.640]
Okay.

[02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:59.200]
Here's the Sun-Senthal homepage, which is for some reason.

[02:15:59.340 --> 02:16:02.040]
I don't know why it's so goddamn slow probably because it's coming from there.

[02:16:03.340 --> 02:16:03.740]
Columns.

[02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:04.560]
Columns, columns.

[02:16:04.740 --> 02:16:08.080]
There's a embattled election supervisor, Miriam Elephant.

[02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:08.740]
She's on there.

[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:10.040]
Michael Mayo.

[02:16:10.180 --> 02:16:12.160]
Now he already wrote his good comp for this year.

[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:13.000]
Nice going, Mike.

[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:16.920]
Home movie focuses on notorious Cuban prisoners.

[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:17.720]
Wow.

[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:19.960]
How do you like that?

[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:22.820]
This is almost a South Florida flavor.

[02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:27.180]
There's often a disconnect between stride elements of South Florida's Cuban American community

[02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:31.480]
and those from other backgrounds when it comes to anti-Cuban castor of fervor, which still

[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.320]
seers almost the halfway out of El Presido.

[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:36.760]
The trip back would help explain the unwavering hatred.

[02:16:38.460 --> 02:16:39.500]
El Presidio.

[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:41.920]
But what does that have?

[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:43.240]
Does that really have to do with South Florida?

[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:44.080]
Just only indirectly.

[02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:45.260]
So that's as close.

[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:46.720]
See, there's my psychic powers again.

[02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:47.340]
How do you like that?

[02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:51.460]
I'm seeing these horses all over the place here.

[02:16:51.540 --> 02:16:54.720]
They must not have the pot opener, something on my racing channel.

[02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:57.260]
Because it's only six minutes to post and post.

[02:16:57.440 --> 02:16:58.840]
I'm just like, buddy, had your chance, Tom.

[02:16:58.940 --> 02:16:59.140]
You done.

[02:16:59.300 --> 02:17:00.380]
Go back to Jerkin, Durkin.

[02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:05.340]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:06.280]
WQAM, deadline.

[02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:06.760]
Hello.

[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:07.760]
Hey, how are you doing, Neil?

[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:08.180]
Pretty good.

[02:17:08.180 --> 02:17:12.720]
You know, that story you read about the Arnie meeting with Ken Ley,

[02:17:12.940 --> 02:17:15.840]
where, you know, prompted me to call you.

[02:17:16.300 --> 02:17:19.060]
Greg Palis is one of the writers for the Guardian.

[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:21.080]
And he's been all over this story.

[02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:23.480]
I read a call by him yesterday or Monday.

[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:25.020]
Yeah, we're at a great call.

[02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:26.680]
Yeah, they are great call.

[02:17:27.180 --> 02:17:30.620]
Ross Perot was involved in that with his company called Energy Strategies.

[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:30.940]
I don't know.

[02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:32.300]
I don't know if you're right.

[02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:33.140]
Yes, I do.

[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:38.020]
And, you know, something that I find amazing about all these talking heads on,

[02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:42.940]
the Gerbos News Networks out there, is how is it that they are trying to spin this

[02:17:42.940 --> 02:17:49.140]
as some kind of a great Davis or Democratic conspiracy or campaign that in the last few days,

[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:53.620]
all of these stories come out when all of these stories have been out, you know, since the 90s.

[02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:57.140]
Isn't this a little bit anticlimactic, though, now having this conversation at this point?

[02:17:57.320 --> 02:17:57.680]
Yes, yeah.

[02:17:57.780 --> 02:18:00.560]
Well, I'm just talking about the method, the way that they're spinning it.

[02:18:00.980 --> 02:18:01.120]
Yeah.

[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:02.120]
To me, that the whole way...

[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:04.660]
Well, a lot of people who made a good point last night on that is that Davis,

[02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:08.840]
who's a very inept politician to begin with, he made a really bad move on Sunday when he, like,

[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:14.020]
started joining in with all of this and piling on to it and saying that there ought to be a criminal investigation.

[02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:17.060]
If he just would have said he'll let the voters decide and if he would have shut up,

[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:18.240]
he might have gotten some miles.

[02:18:18.380 --> 02:18:19.400]
But he still was going to lose his ass.

[02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:19.980]
I agree.

[02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:21.360]
He's totally inept.

[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:22.040]
He just blew it.

[02:18:22.140 --> 02:18:22.880]
I agree with you on that.

[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:25.660]
I handed my hand to Greg Palis, the column from Friday, October 3rd,

[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:30.400]
Arnold unplugged its Ostele of Easter, the $9 billion of the governorate who was selected.

[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:32.720]
And it's one of the best things I've ever read on the air.

[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:37.200]
If you go to his website, he's got a whole series of columns that he was doing this investigation

[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:41.140]
during, actually during the energy of the California rolling blackouts.

[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:41.820]
Right.

[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.200]
But my point was earlier though, the demonizing of the LA time,

[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:47.900]
that's being some kind of left wing...

[02:18:47.900 --> 02:18:49.580]
But that's all knows it's over.

[02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:50.380]
The election's over.

[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:50.700]
I know.

[02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:51.780]
Somebody will pinch you.

[02:18:51.860 --> 02:18:53.420]
Believe me, in your case, probably pretty soon.

[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:54.460]
Somebody will pinch you and wake up.

[02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:54.840]
It's over.

[02:18:56.580 --> 02:18:58.680]
1256 and 56, the WQAM.

[02:18:58.900 --> 02:19:01.260]
Well, he just, I hope he has a sweet, a gay day.

[02:19:03.860 --> 02:19:05.320]
Speaking of that, yeah.

[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:05.680]
Why?

[02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:08.580]
Why don't he just, she's just a little bit hysterical out one there.

[02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:10.840]
I mean, his comments were good, but he's a little bit,

[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:14.020]
she's a little out of control since it's already old news.

[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:16.940]
It's a dead meat, just like a great Davis, dead meat.

[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:20.780]
In fact, that's how you tell one, like me, when it's great.

[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:21.340]
Right?

[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:21.760]
Right.

[02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:22.920]
Ooh.

[02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:23.760]
Then you got to smell it.

[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:26.920]
Green, green isn't good, but when it turns gray, oh boy.

[02:19:27.540 --> 02:19:29.000]
When it doubt, toss it out.

[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:29.900]
Hey, listen.

[02:19:30.420 --> 02:19:33.120]
Speaking of food, balance for life has got the good stuff.

[02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:35.420]
They bring you a little black sack right to your door every morning.

[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:37.500]
Three gourmet meals, two delicious snacks that were in there.

[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:41.160]
The food is fresh, delicious, you'll get omelettes and frittadas and chicken dishes.

[02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:43.760]
And a few beef dishes and all kinds of really neat stuff.

[02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:45.120]
Pass on to Bobbogganouche, please.

[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:48.380]
It's all based on the principles of the zone diet,

[02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:50.760]
which is a very effective program, but it's very complicated.

[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:53.720]
The good thing is they do all the figuring and all you have to do is the eating.

[02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:56.840]
Just pick up that sack every morning and believe me,

[02:19:56.880 --> 02:19:58.480]
all the good stuff is in there, right in your sack.

[02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:02.220]
No cooking, no shopping, no cleaning, no calorie counting, no carb counting,

[02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:03.480]
nothing to finger out.

[02:20:03.740 --> 02:20:07.440]
In fact, balance for life like I always tell you is the only company that lets you pick between two choices

[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:09.980]
for each meal every day that you're on their program.

[02:20:10.460 --> 02:20:14.160]
But balance for life, help you lose that weight once and for all you'll start seeing great results

[02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:17.420]
within just a matter of days on that ugly, nasty, much-hated scale.

[02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:20.300]
Call balance for life today, tool for, and that's not tool for you.

[02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:20.920]
It's a broward number.

[02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:27.660]
954, 568, 3229, whatever the charge is, it's well worth it to start losing that weight and get your health back.

[02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:34.880]
954, 568, 3229, or get more info about their great program on their website, balanceforlife.com.

[02:20:34.900 --> 02:20:39.080]
My life and look all this is for trail by city.

[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:41.280]
Way to way, yeah.

[02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:49.240]
I'm Judge Roy Moore, and the next best thing to watch an end,

[02:20:49.380 --> 02:20:54.260]
Colter, Spake, Mad Drone, is the nail Rogers, fair and balanced, one to two hour.

[02:20:58.580 --> 02:21:01.400]
Don't it, I told you don't bother me while I'm in here.

[02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:01.920]
I, sir.

[02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:03.240]
Hello?

[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:04.660]
It's Nikki Moss.

[02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:07.140]
Oh, Mr. Mouse, good morning.

[02:21:07.260 --> 02:21:07.920]
How are you?

[02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:10.740]
What the hell are you doing to me?

[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:12.520]
Nothing, sir.

[02:21:12.700 --> 02:21:14.180]
You're freaking killing me.

[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:14.960]
No, not.

[02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:17.580]
I got there but Kelly called me every three minutes.

[02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:20.000]
Why did we move the protest?

[02:21:20.460 --> 02:21:21.980]
Sir, you told me to move the practice.

[02:21:21.980 --> 02:21:24.580]
I didn't tell you why did you move the business under stud meat.

[02:21:24.580 --> 02:21:25.740]
No, sir.

[02:21:25.880 --> 02:21:27.820]
You said move the practice to Monday.

[02:21:27.820 --> 02:21:29.640]
Hey, hey, listen but, wife.

[02:21:30.220 --> 02:21:30.800]
I'm the boss.

[02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:32.060]
I make the decisions.

[02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:33.320]
You take the heat.

[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:33.700]
Right.

[02:21:34.020 --> 02:21:35.380]
You all move the practice.

[02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:36.140]
Okay.

[02:21:36.540 --> 02:21:37.780]
How we doing with it anyway?

[02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:39.380]
I am mad.

[02:21:39.500 --> 02:21:40.220]
Hold on.

[02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:41.740]
Remaz.

[02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:43.240]
Yeah, boss.

[02:21:43.660 --> 02:21:45.580]
Shot the hell up.

[02:21:45.940 --> 02:21:47.300]
I'm on the phone, Reemez.

[02:21:47.660 --> 02:21:48.160]
Hi, sir.

[02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:49.320]
Yes, sir.

[02:21:49.340 --> 02:21:50.000]
What was your question?

[02:21:50.340 --> 02:21:51.180]
I'm killing you.

[02:21:51.320 --> 02:21:53.040]
I'm going crazy over here.

[02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:57.340]
Between David Kelly and now Michael Jackson called me every three minutes.

[02:21:57.500 --> 02:21:59.660]
I'm going to go out of my freaking mind.

[02:22:00.660 --> 02:22:01.500]
Hold on.

[02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:02.600]
Remaz.

[02:22:03.500 --> 02:22:04.400]
Yeah, here you go.

[02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:05.740]
Stop it, Reemez.

[02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:07.900]
I'm going to fall, boss.

[02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:09.800]
Stop, stop the floor, Reemez.

[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:13.880]
Let's sit in my hand, Reemez.

[02:22:14.220 --> 02:22:15.420]
That's your penis, boss.

[02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:17.000]
My other hand, Reemez.

[02:22:17.980 --> 02:22:19.180]
That's the phone, boss.

[02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:19.540]
Right.

[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:21.880]
I can't hear anything, Reemez.

[02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:23.020]
Stop sawing the floor.

[02:22:23.020 --> 02:22:23.020]

[02:22:23.020 --> 02:22:23.900]
Sorry.

[02:22:24.220 --> 02:22:25.160]
I said, sir.

[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:27.680]
The moves are working out very well.

[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:29.700]
The practice is fourth in its time.

[02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:30.000]
What?

[02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:30.420]
What?

[02:22:30.420 --> 02:22:30.480]
What?

[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:31.080]
What?

[02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:31.580]
What?

[02:22:31.580 --> 02:22:32.100]
What?

[02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:32.100]

[02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:32.140]
What?

[02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:32.240]

[02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:32.240]

[02:22:35.780 --> 02:22:35.780]

[02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:36.140]

[02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:36.140]

[02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:36.500]
What?

[02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:36.500]

[02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:36.500]

[02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:36.500]

[02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:36.500]

[02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:36.500]

[02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:36.500]

[02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:36.500]

[02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:37.440]
What?

[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:39.520]
What?

[02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:46.240]
What?

[02:22:46.780 --> 02:22:47.300]
What?

[02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:49.460]

[02:22:49.820 --> 02:22:49.820]

[02:22:49.820 --> 02:22:49.820]

[02:22:49.820 --> 02:22:49.820]

[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:50.100]
What?

[02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:50.100]

[02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:50.100]

[02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:50.160]
What?

[02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:50.160]

[02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:50.160]

[02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:50.160]

[02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:50.180]
What?

[02:22:50.180 --> 02:22:50.180]

[02:22:50.180 --> 02:22:50.180]

[02:22:50.180 --> 02:22:50.180]

[02:22:50.180 --> 02:22:50.180]

[02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:50.340]

[02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:50.340]

[02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:50.340]

[02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:51.280]
Don't play, Reemez.

[02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:53.160]
I'll jam that thing down your throat.

[02:22:54.040 --> 02:22:55.720]
It's going to move right away from me.

[02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:57.180]
I'll come on, Blue Moon.

[02:22:57.860 --> 02:22:58.860]
I'm allergic.

[02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:00.200]
I'll answer.

[02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:02.980]
Sir, over 25 million people, sir.

[02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:03.820]
Stop up, Eisner.

[02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:04.720]
Listen.

[02:23:05.080 --> 02:23:05.200]
Yeah.

[02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:06.980]
You see me what I'm doing here?

[02:23:07.880 --> 02:23:08.880]
Sir, you're on the phone.

[02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:10.980]
I know I'm on the phone.

[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:12.120]
Do you see what I'm doing?

[02:23:12.860 --> 02:23:15.000]
You're an imagination for crying out loud.

[02:23:15.660 --> 02:23:18.080]
I'm moving my hands up and down, fly to side.

[02:23:18.300 --> 02:23:19.180]
I'm the puppet master.

[02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:20.560]
I say it.

[02:23:20.780 --> 02:23:21.500]
You do it.

[02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:24.460]
Now Fox is going to air all the stuff that you cut out

[02:23:24.460 --> 02:23:25.800]
of a Michael Jackson interview.

[02:23:26.580 --> 02:23:29.680]
But sir, you told me to edit out all that stuff to make him look like a real man.

[02:23:31.540 --> 02:23:33.200]
Puppet master, me!

[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:34.800]
Idiot!

[02:23:35.900 --> 02:23:35.900]

[02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:41.280]
Reemez!

[02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:41.660]
Reemez!

[02:23:41.660 --> 02:23:42.460]
Yes, the air boss.

[02:23:42.740 --> 02:23:44.400]
What the hell are you doing now?

[02:23:44.900 --> 02:23:45.840]
Listen to blow, boss.

[02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:47.740]
It's nothing wrong with the floor, Reemez.

[02:23:47.940 --> 02:23:48.880]
What's this in my ear?

[02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:50.560]
That's your penis, boss.

[02:23:50.800 --> 02:23:52.120]
My other ear, Reemez.

[02:23:53.180 --> 02:23:54.100]
That's the phone, boss.

[02:23:54.120 --> 02:23:55.280]
That's the phone, Reemez.

[02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:55.800]
Get out.

[02:23:56.100 --> 02:23:57.020]
Come on over to work.

[02:23:57.180 --> 02:23:57.720]
Get out.

[02:23:57.720 --> 02:23:58.880]
Hi, sir.

[02:23:59.100 --> 02:23:59.460]
Yes, sir.

[02:23:59.620 --> 02:24:00.040]
Killin' me.

[02:24:00.900 --> 02:24:01.680]
Killin' me.

[02:24:01.900 --> 02:24:02.680]
I'm sorry, sir.

[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:03.740]
Killin' me.

[02:24:04.180 --> 02:24:04.480]
Sorry.

[02:24:04.820 --> 02:24:05.920]
Killin' me softly.

[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:10.000]
That many drivers of nuts don't turn your back.

[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:14.040]
She'll spother you to death as junk you stack.

[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.960]
That demon's got a time, red for his life.

[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:22.040]
He dated her one time, she thought she was his wife.

[02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:25.760]
She wears your clothes when you're gone, watches you sleep.

[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:29.700]
You think it's casual, but her feelings are feet.

[02:24:30.740 --> 02:24:33.680]
That many drivers of nuts, but water funds.

[02:24:40.220 --> 02:24:41.240]
All right.

[02:24:41.700 --> 02:24:42.640]
She can't act.

[02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:43.680]
She can't sing.

[02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:45.240]
What's the guy to do?

[02:24:45.540 --> 02:24:47.320]
I felt myself see all the sister.

[02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:49.280]
She can barely tie her shoe.

[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:51.780]
Then you have not called her out.

[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:53.420]
He said she was the best.

[02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:55.460]
She thought he met her singing.

[02:24:55.460 --> 02:24:57.740]
But he really met her chest.

[02:24:57.860 --> 02:25:01.540]
And so if you're looking through a playboy magazine,

[02:25:01.840 --> 02:25:05.680]
you'll see my older sister on the pages in between.

[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:10.180]
I'm just being told that a million copies have been sold.

[02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:11.980]
My sister is the telephone.

[02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:14.100]
My daughter is the telephone.

[02:25:14.460 --> 02:25:18.160]
I'm just being told that my sister is the telephone.

[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:19.720]
My sister is the telephone.

[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:20.500]
She's alone.

[02:25:20.660 --> 02:25:22.180]
My daughter is the telephone.

[02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:46.900]
I'm just being told that my sister is the telephone.

[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:47.640]
I'm just being told that my sister is the telephone.

[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:47.640]

[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:47.640]

[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:47.640]

[02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:47.700]

[02:25:48.460 --> 02:25:52.160]
I'm just being told that my sister is the telephone.

[02:25:54.700 --> 02:25:57.020]
I'm just being told that my sister is the telephone.

[02:25:57.340 --> 02:26:00.920]
I'm just being told that my sister is the telephone.

[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:03.040]
I'm just being told that my sister is the telephone.

[02:26:05.260 --> 02:26:19.040]
I'm just being told that my sister is the telephone.

[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:20.860]
Oh, that's good.

[02:26:21.780 --> 02:26:22.760]
Take that change.

[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:22.760]

[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:22.760]

[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:22.760]

[02:26:24.860 --> 02:26:25.960]
Oh, that's good.

[02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:27.860]
Oh, that's good.

[02:26:31.180 --> 02:26:31.840]
Oh, that's good.

[02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:35.720]
Oh, that's good.

[02:26:36.260 --> 02:26:37.560]
Oh, that's good.

[02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:39.820]
Shut up, you little huff.

[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:41.920]
Ninja Rogers, hey.

[02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:47.380]
Some mouthful of the Sorsitian War Hayes Panves.

[02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:57.380]
That pipe smoker and unpsychumsized cute wolf Ben engaged in a fake-a-da-da-da-da-da.

[02:26:57.420 --> 02:27:00.160]
I'm a cranky homo-fold.

[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:04.520]
Not that I mind it, but I'm way too old.

[02:27:05.380 --> 02:27:07.680]
I bet this eyes pop feelin' in bed.

[02:27:08.460 --> 02:27:11.920]
It interests with feedlers, my man friend.

[02:27:13.020 --> 02:27:15.900]
I'll kiss and make up with Jinderin some day years.

[02:27:15.900 --> 02:27:19.520]
And then ask them to rate my fun.

[02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:23.060]
No, very no, very again.

[02:27:24.860 --> 02:27:28.300]
Though I would not feel the most full.

[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:28.860]
No.

[02:27:29.300 --> 02:27:32.000]
And I would not be ashamed.

[02:27:33.020 --> 02:27:36.160]
I've got a ginger and more gay union.

[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:39.780]
Just bold and then stroking away.

[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:44.380]
Boy, wait, kill me, you're not my type.

[02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:48.580]
Yeah, sounds like a nine-year-old kid.

[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:49.140]
Hey!

[02:27:50.460 --> 02:27:52.380]
Only a macho-menly guy.

[02:27:52.740 --> 02:27:53.720]
You don't know this.

[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:56.240]
That makes me lift my wig.

[02:27:58.380 --> 02:28:00.260]
Jinder was a lover of mine.

[02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:04.340]
I'd bury my boldest feigny nose.

[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:09.040]
Inside his heavily-rerended-ed-ed-ing.

[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:09.660]
Rack them!

[02:28:10.060 --> 02:28:13.220]
No, I would not be a sport-old.

[02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:13.800]
Now!

[02:28:14.220 --> 02:28:16.800]
If I was not a closet of faith.

[02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:20.840]
That's why a ginger and more gay union.

[02:28:21.620 --> 02:28:24.840]
Would make me feel gizzy and gay.

[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:27.820]
Everybody follow my thousand bulls.

[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:30.740]
Yeah, a ginger and more gay union.

[02:28:31.100 --> 02:28:34.420]
Would make my sorrel-boney ass feel safe.

[02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:38.880]
If we had a ginger and more gay union.

[02:28:39.700 --> 02:28:42.060]
Then he wouldn't have to get me raped.

[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:42.880]
Absolutely.

[02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:45.440]
Wow, take a look at their open-fury.

[02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:46.080]
Have you seen them?

[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:48.340]
Yeah, that's somebody on our website.

[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:52.060]
Towing off after your last night's very exciting victory in California.

[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:52.880]
Thank you, Dennis.

[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:56.160]
What? I'm thanking Dennis for sending us that.

[02:28:56.460 --> 02:28:58.900]
Oh, thanks, Dennis, and thanks, Eric, for the tremendous work he's doing.

[02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:00.820]
And he's spreading all the terrible things you've said about him.

[02:29:01.620 --> 02:29:04.700]
And it says the caption on the picture says it's not a tumor.

[02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:06.240]
It's the groping purer.

[02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:06.880]
Oh!

[02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:11.400]
And he looks like he might be playing a little groping right there.

[02:29:11.500 --> 02:29:12.580]
Or maybe just finished, I don't know.

[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:15.320]
Do we want the penis picture?

[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:17.680]
As well.

[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:19.800]
It's floating around.

[02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:22.000]
Arnold's penis is floating around the internet.

[02:29:22.140 --> 02:29:23.100]
Do we want to post that as well?

[02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:25.280]
This is the penis picture.

[02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:26.620]
Unless you have him look closely.

[02:29:26.620 --> 02:29:30.220]
No, no. I know, but there's another full on unobstured one.

[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:35.440]
No, I think leaving this little dude, leaving just a little bit to the imagination is not bad.

[02:29:35.500 --> 02:29:37.200]
And then of course we got these sick-free din-

[02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:37.780]
Roar!

[02:29:38.860 --> 02:29:39.220]
Wow.

[02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:44.040]
If you don't check out our website today, man, your life ain't worth a shmit off of that right now.

[02:29:44.040 --> 02:29:44.540]
What did you say?

[02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:47.620]
I said your life ain't worth a shmit if you don't check out our website.

[02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:48.960]
Oh, okay, I was totally-

[02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:49.700]
I said shmit.

[02:29:49.900 --> 02:29:51.860]
Okay, as in hellmuch-smit, remember him?

[02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:53.160]
Hellmuch-smit.

[02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:54.440]
That there was a good Detroit man guy.

[02:29:55.020 --> 02:29:56.980]
We're all drinking Beck's beer and Heineken today.

[02:29:58.640 --> 02:29:59.540]
Here's a couple of facts.

[02:30:00.580 --> 02:30:05.920]
It says, how about the movie with that douchebag keeper Sutherland where they tie some chicks legs to two tractor trailers and ripper and two?

[02:30:06.220 --> 02:30:06.840]
What movie is that?

[02:30:08.180 --> 02:30:09.160]
I don't recall that.

[02:30:09.340 --> 02:30:11.380]
It sounds like they might have it confused with the hitcher.

[02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:14.400]
No, no, no, no. This is a different one.

[02:30:15.460 --> 02:30:16.740]
It's a cheesy movie.

[02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:20.500]
The hitcher, you see, the hitcher never happened.

[02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:23.380]
And although there was some horrible, uh, we never saw them though.

[02:30:23.460 --> 02:30:25.180]
We never saw them kill anybody in the hitcher, did we?

[02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:28.900]
Well, that, the uh, Jennifer Jason Leasing, which I already submitted.

[02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:30.560]
What?

[02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:32.360]
Because it reminded me he pulled her apart.

[02:30:34.180 --> 02:30:35.000]
In the hitcher?

[02:30:35.340 --> 02:30:35.660]
Yeah.

[02:30:36.820 --> 02:30:38.500]
Remember, he hitched her to a trailer?

[02:30:38.940 --> 02:30:39.240]
Right.

[02:30:40.480 --> 02:30:42.720]
And uh, and he even pulled her apart?

[02:30:42.980 --> 02:30:43.360]
Yeah, I did.

[02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:44.960]
No, they stopped it.

[02:30:45.180 --> 02:30:45.720]
No, they didn't.

[02:30:45.720 --> 02:30:46.240]
What are you talking about?

[02:30:46.380 --> 02:30:46.920]
No, they didn't.

[02:30:48.060 --> 02:30:49.080]
You gotta see it again.

[02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:50.080]
Are you sure?

[02:30:50.340 --> 02:30:51.180]
Well, I'll be damned.

[02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:52.140]
It's one of my favorite movies.

[02:30:52.440 --> 02:30:53.880]
I'm too obsessed with the finger foods.

[02:30:54.660 --> 02:30:55.600]
With Riker Howard.

[02:30:55.700 --> 02:30:56.340]
Are you a sea-tower?

[02:30:56.660 --> 02:30:57.340]
A sea-tower scene as well.

[02:30:58.060 --> 02:30:58.220]
Yeah.

[02:30:58.440 --> 02:30:59.020]
Oh, yeah.

[02:30:59.180 --> 02:31:02.760]
Boy, there was something really, really interesting going on.

[02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:05.980]
In fact, even the cops said there's something...

[02:31:06.800 --> 02:31:07.160]
Yeah.

[02:31:07.780 --> 02:31:11.380]
And Tom howl wiped it off his chin and like, had that look.

[02:31:11.560 --> 02:31:12.260]
They were looking to the live.

[02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:15.040]
Boy, could we have a good time together and hear on the inside?

[02:31:15.180 --> 02:31:15.720]
Is what they were thinking?

[02:31:17.380 --> 02:31:19.260]
Uh, he actually pulled her apart?

[02:31:19.720 --> 02:31:19.960]
Yes.

[02:31:20.340 --> 02:31:21.600]
I thought he stopped them.

[02:31:21.660 --> 02:31:22.840]
Well, I'm gonna have to watch it again.

[02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:25.840]
Anyway, somebody else says my suggestion to add to the pull

[02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:27.560]
to French film irreversible.

[02:31:27.820 --> 02:31:28.020]
Yes.

[02:31:28.240 --> 02:31:32.660]
It was shown in a very limited release this year and is the single most horrifying act of violence

[02:31:32.660 --> 02:31:35.820]
I've viewed in many, many, many years of film watching.

[02:31:36.040 --> 02:31:36.540]
All right.

[02:31:36.740 --> 02:31:36.840]
Yes.

[02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:42.840]
Paul and Deerfield, thank you, Paul, says there's a scene in this film where a couple of characters get into a heated argument in a gay sex club.

[02:31:43.300 --> 02:31:43.880]
Gay sex club.

[02:31:43.960 --> 02:31:44.360]
Absolutely.

[02:31:44.360 --> 02:31:48.420]
One of the men that uses a large fire extinguisher to beat the other man's head to a pulp.

[02:31:48.580 --> 02:31:49.120]
All right.

[02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:54.820]
Literally, blow by a blow out of the force of the heavy canister the man's head actually breaks apart.

[02:31:55.040 --> 02:32:00.400]
His teeth cave in, his face cracks open, his skull shatters, his brains leak out.

[02:32:00.500 --> 02:32:00.800]
Oh!

[02:32:01.520 --> 02:32:03.680]
All this happens in one unbroken shot.

[02:32:03.820 --> 02:32:06.000]
How the special effect was achieved is a mystery.

[02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:10.280]
It's the most raw, sickening act of screen violence I've ever seen.

[02:32:10.480 --> 02:32:11.060]
Paul is...

[02:32:11.060 --> 02:32:12.760]
Absolutely correct, sir.

[02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:18.360]
It says if you get the chance to see it, it is available on DVD, consider yourself worn, irreversible, a French film.

[02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:19.000]
And...

[02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:19.840]
Once you see it, yes.

[02:32:20.100 --> 02:32:24.020]
As if that's not enough, it also contains the most horrific rape scene I've ever seen on film.

[02:32:24.620 --> 02:32:25.060]
All right.

[02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:25.560]
Excellent.

[02:32:26.300 --> 02:32:29.860]
So you can kind of like a tooper, a keeper and a tooper, not many other years.

[02:32:30.160 --> 02:32:31.560]
Oh, there's kind of laser by the way.

[02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:33.020]
The birdie council was right.

[02:32:33.260 --> 02:32:34.380]
Oh my God.

[02:32:34.580 --> 02:32:35.080]
Oh my God.

[02:32:35.800 --> 02:32:37.760]
And Frederick Bush was right.

[02:32:38.300 --> 02:32:40.820]
And he coalition the patients with forcefully security.

[02:32:40.820 --> 02:32:41.900]
Oh, you kiddin' bitch.

[02:32:42.040 --> 02:32:43.200]
Get her ass off of there, man.

[02:32:43.380 --> 02:32:44.380]
Get out of my face.

[02:32:45.220 --> 02:32:48.000]
You sell out, you cop out, you silly goose you.

[02:32:48.180 --> 02:32:50.140]

Don't, don't, don't, don't.

[02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:27.840]
Great, the UPS truck is here with my date for tonight.

[02:34:28.100 --> 02:34:29.620]
I'm sorry, I'm an avidale.

[02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:31.560]
She's my very sensual.

[02:34:32.620 --> 02:34:35.080]
Because she's got no genitals.

[02:34:36.040 --> 02:34:38.040]
She feels sensational.

[02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:41.280]
Because her mouth is electrical.

[02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:45.820]
Heaven fuck with my girlfriend, there's always a cinch.

[02:34:46.100 --> 02:34:49.120]
When she's broke up the fire, he faths by square inch.

[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:52.620]
She used to be fun for me till she busted.

[02:34:54.860 --> 02:34:56.620]
My girlfriend isn't playable.

[02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:59.900]
Yeah, she's a real ghost, she's made of silicon.

[02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:03.120]
My girlfriend isn't playable.

[02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:06.620]
Yeah, she's a real ghost, she's made of Taiwan.

[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:10.520]
I bought myself a samurai.

[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:13.740]
They all look identical.

[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:17.060]
Her panties are edible.

[02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:20.300]
It's too bitchy swimable.

[02:35:21.420 --> 02:35:24.720]
It was just her first face, so you know how I felt.

[02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:28.040]
She got rich and burns and started to melt.

[02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:31.520]
She used to be fun for me till she ignited.

[02:35:33.660 --> 02:35:35.460]
My girlfriend isn't playable.

[02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:39.140]
Oh no, how it happened I don't know how.

[02:35:40.340 --> 02:35:42.040]
My girlfriend isn't playable.

[02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:45.580]
No, I'm already stupid, she's a fire now.

[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:48.520]
My girlfriend isn't playable.

[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:01.040]
Oh, we're fine.

[02:36:17.460 --> 02:36:17.540]
Okay.

[02:36:28.940 --> 02:36:32.680]
This is scene to be about to quit.

[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:37.120]
And I need another year.

[02:36:38.300 --> 02:36:39.120]
Yes.

[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:43.340]
Don't bow guard that joy in my brain.

[02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:46.700]
Pass it all around.

[02:36:49.180 --> 02:36:53.640]
Don't bow guard that joy in my brain.

[02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:56.440]
You're better now.

[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:10.740]
Roll.

[02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:18.900]
Under the wall.

[02:37:20.980 --> 02:37:24.860]
Just like the other one.

[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:25.640]
Uh-huh.

[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:28.980]
This was scene to be about to quit.

[02:37:30.740 --> 02:37:33.700]
And I don't have another sense.

[02:37:37.340 --> 02:37:40.060]
Don't bow guard that joy in my brain.

[02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:43.420]
Pass it all around.

[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:50.180]
Don't bow guard that joy in my brain.

[02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:53.420]
Pass it all around.

[02:37:58.240 --> 02:38:02.520]
Under the wall guard that joy in my brain.

[02:38:04.420 --> 02:38:07.000]
Just pass it all around.

[02:38:08.700 --> 02:38:10.700]
I don't know how that goes.

[02:38:11.740 --> 02:38:15.580]
I don't know how that goes.

[02:38:19.020 --> 02:38:19.580]
Oh.

[02:38:20.900 --> 02:38:25.240]
The American cheesecats will remind you that everything tastes better with cheese.

[02:38:25.460 --> 02:38:29.240]
I hate broccoli, except when my mom melts cheddar cheese on top.

[02:38:29.540 --> 02:38:30.880]
Then I even ask for seconds.

[02:38:31.180 --> 02:38:34.060]
Yes, there's nothing like cheese to make things taste terrific.

[02:38:34.060 --> 02:38:37.340]
I'm a side show geek in a circus and I eat ground glass for a living.

[02:38:37.580 --> 02:38:40.080]
My secret? I top the shards with grated parmesan.

[02:38:40.540 --> 02:38:42.940]
It tastes great and the cheese helps to absorb the blood.

[02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:47.140]
That's right. Nothing pops things off like a big sweaty glob of cheese.

[02:38:47.380 --> 02:38:49.500]
My husband likes me to, you know, do him.

[02:38:49.740 --> 02:38:50.680]
But I hate the taste.

[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.660]
So I just wrap it in an individual slice of American cheese.

[02:38:54.100 --> 02:38:54.900]
It goes down easy.

[02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:56.760]
And that makes it easier to go down.

[02:38:57.060 --> 02:38:59.000]
Cheese makes everything taste better.

[02:38:59.260 --> 02:39:01.720]
So remember, don't forget your cheese.

[02:39:02.540 --> 02:39:05.320]
Oh my God, I feel so good.

[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:08.220]
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

[02:39:08.380 --> 02:39:10.240]
Oh yeah, who's your daddy?

[02:39:10.860 --> 02:39:11.820]
Who's your daddy?

[02:39:13.020 --> 02:39:14.320]
Oh my God.

[02:39:14.900 --> 02:39:16.220]
Oh, you're playing with my boss.

[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:17.700]
Play with my boss.

[02:39:18.420 --> 02:39:20.560]
Oh, I feel so good.

[02:39:21.540 --> 02:39:23.900]
I just rolled up around and I'm so good.

[02:39:24.420 --> 02:39:25.840]
Oh my God.

[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:27.260]
I love it with you.

[02:39:27.620 --> 02:39:28.420]
Oh, oh, sure.

[02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:31.260]
Oh, oh.

[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:37.300]
What's wrong with you, I'll go get you a towel.

[02:39:46.420 --> 02:39:50.720]
When you got on the airplane

[02:39:51.420 --> 02:39:55.680]
The drink started right away

[02:39:55.680 --> 02:39:58.800]
A couple of our girls

[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:03.060]
Memes and tonic and tango rain

[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:05.260]
And you need another one.

[02:40:05.460 --> 02:40:10.680]
You started acting silly

[02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:15.540]
Like happy jack the clown

[02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:18.380]
You pulled your zipper

[02:40:18.380 --> 02:40:24.120]
And your pants came a tumbling down a home

[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:30.840]
Then you climbed on the carts

[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:31.760]
All right.

[02:40:32.100 --> 02:40:35.820]
Things got started with the carts

[02:40:35.820 --> 02:40:39.040]
Then you do, do.

[02:40:40.820 --> 02:40:43.400]
In front of a soul

[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:47.620]
Joe Raj, don't you know that

[02:40:47.620 --> 02:40:50.820]
If the bathroom was occupied

[02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:55.860]
One of us would step for a sigh

[02:40:56.820 --> 02:41:00.540]
To keep you from do doing

[02:41:01.820 --> 02:41:03.840]
On the plane.

Here comes the politicians

[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:20.080]

[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:23.100]
After the terminator

[02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:25.460]
But can he kick his butt?

[02:41:31.180 --> 02:41:33.820]
Then Cald before he knows

[02:41:33.820 --> 02:41:36.480]
He's creating quite a fuss

[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:39.600]
Even though he's let him know

[02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:41.920]
Stay for English and on all does

[02:41:43.620 --> 02:41:46.680]
And he doesn't live in ways

[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:52.040]
But he shows all the issues in that California state

[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:55.040]
He's going on to the defaite

[02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:58.220]

The NASCAR PGA channel

[02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:40.600]
The NASCAR PGA channel is the secondary

[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:42.040]
Of the figures that do the right channel

[02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:44.980]
Be there

[02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:51.060]
She's a perfect match

[02:57:51.060 --> 02:57:55.240]
Who likes to flash her pants

[02:57:55.240 --> 02:57:57.740]
Who likes to flash her pants

[02:57:57.740 --> 02:57:59.420]
When she don't have those on

[02:58:00.720 --> 02:58:03.600]
She's hanging like a straw me on right

[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:05.120]

Pink Ultras Rancid Snap

[02:58:11.500 --> 02:58:13.880]
Imagine what you can catch

[02:58:15.180 --> 02:58:16.320]
From an

[02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:17.560]
Ultras Rancid Snap

[02:58:21.260 --> 02:58:23.060]
Gonna reappear

[02:58:25.260 --> 02:58:27.440]
Scratches with a brush

[02:58:27.440 --> 02:58:28.280]
You

[02:58:29.520 --> 02:58:31.240]
She'd find her all go

[02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:35.500]
And he'll learn but you'll never get throught

[02:58:35.500 --> 02:58:37.480]
And Coltras Rancid Snap

[02:58:37.480 --> 02:58:41.780]
And Coltras Rancid Snap

[02:58:43.080 --> 02:58:46.040]
A swirl is full of crap

[02:58:47.200 --> 02:58:49.620]
And Coltras Rancid Snap

[02:58:53.120 --> 02:58:55.200]
Using pleasure and moisture

[02:58:56.820 --> 02:58:58.800]
Making out her poison

[02:59:00.440 --> 02:59:02.720]
Walking with the dill of dough

[02:59:04.100 --> 02:59:06.420]
Burmely jammed inside of her butt

And Coltras Rancid Snap

[02:59:09.500 --> 02:59:11.780]
And Coltras Rancid Snap

[02:59:13.020 --> 02:59:15.780]
Go on and know what it can hatch

[02:59:16.780 --> 02:59:19.020]
And Coltras Snap

[02:59:19.960 --> 02:59:20.740]
My

[02:59:20.740 --> 02:59:22.000]
And local

[02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.240]
We're sports radio 560

[02:59:24.240 --> 02:59:26.380]
You and you and you and you

[02:59:26.380 --> 02:59:26.460]
And you

[02:59:30.280 --> 02:59:32.520]
Well my name is Gary Conjett

[02:59:32.520 --> 02:59:34.940]
And I am living my first beer

[02:59:37.060 --> 02:59:39.200]
Because I think one of my interns

[02:59:39.200 --> 02:59:41.840]
And she went a gift of beer

[02:59:43.780 --> 02:59:46.680]
Oh, Shondra they weren't surprised

[02:59:47.340 --> 02:59:49.840]
When her eyes were told to come side by

[02:59:50.540 --> 02:59:52.700]
And I was hoping Shondra

[02:59:52.700 --> 02:59:54.540]
Humping her instead of my body

[02:59:58.120 --> 02:59:59.560]
Humping Shondra

[02:59:59.560 --> 03:00:01.260]
Humping Shondra

[03:00:01.260 --> 03:00:02.880]
Humping Shondra

[03:00:02.880 --> 03:00:04.680]
Humping Shondra

[03:00:04.680 --> 03:00:06.240]
Humping Shondra

[03:00:06.240 --> 03:00:08.120]
Humping Shondra

[03:00:08.120 --> 03:00:11.440]
Humping Shondra

[03:00:11.440 --> 03:00:12.900]
Humping Shondra

[03:00:12.900 --> 03:00:14.580]
Humping Shondra

[03:00:14.580 --> 03:00:21.480]
Humping Shondra

[03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:46.820]
I believe the language I hear on TV every home of word is an obscenity.

[03:00:47.340 --> 03:00:54.300]
In years to be the cable was a horror at worst but now the networks let their actors curse.

[03:00:55.440 --> 03:01:02.480]
There's no end in sight to this obscenity, all the dialogue and tape from fantasy.

[03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:10.020]
Swearin' like a sailor on a pre-day pass, words a whole lot worse than asked.

[03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:14.720]
If one has bum, how will it be?

[03:01:15.180 --> 03:01:18.080]
If one takes out the F-bomber, where TV?

[03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:25.520]
If one has bum, there's no telling where, they'll drop one on the U-T-L.

[03:01:27.100 --> 03:01:32.140]
If Jesus walked deep for today and wanted to lose weight,

[03:01:32.220 --> 03:01:37.940]
like Jared to look good for that special lady on a special day to hypothetical,

[03:01:38.360 --> 03:01:41.840]
to lose a tunic size would be quite a feat.

[03:01:42.060 --> 03:01:42.860]
Even for Jesus.

[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:47.260]
So here's the question, what would Jesus eat?

[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:52.840]
Swiss cheese, cos it's holy, miracle whip.

[03:01:52.840 --> 03:01:54.280]
He'd have no other.

[03:01:54.460 --> 03:01:57.800]
Thomas's English muffins, stout, virgin bloody Mary,

[03:01:58.040 --> 03:01:59.100]
son or his mother.

[03:02:03.660 --> 03:02:04.700]
Lucky charms.

[03:02:07.020 --> 03:02:09.940]
You guys are supposed to sing because he cured the leper cons.

[03:02:11.600 --> 03:02:14.480]
He did the actual cure leper cons.

[03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:18.060]
What he did was he cured leper, not leper colonies.

[03:02:18.060 --> 03:02:19.420]
Oh, I must have called him.

[03:02:19.520 --> 03:02:21.440]
That's red, that's just, I don't think that's any different.

[03:02:21.680 --> 03:02:22.180]
Lepper food.

[03:02:22.560 --> 03:02:24.920]
Angel food cake.

[03:02:25.500 --> 03:02:26.260]
That's better.

[03:02:26.540 --> 03:02:27.240]
Devil Pam.

[03:02:27.940 --> 03:02:28.520]
No way.

[03:02:28.820 --> 03:02:29.580]
Hearts of Pam.

[03:02:30.200 --> 03:02:31.000]
Tell us more.

[03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:32.200]
On ice cream.

[03:02:32.620 --> 03:02:33.640]
Make up, make up, make up.

[03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:34.520]
Home all Sunday.

[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:36.700]
Yeah, yeah!

[03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:40.900]
That's what Jesus would eat.

[03:02:41.160 --> 03:02:42.440]
Thank you, move buddy.

[03:02:42.780 --> 03:02:44.340]
Oh, man.

[03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:48.040]
And then cos he went to buy his groceries.

[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:52.620]
He'd redeem coupons and all the store's employees.

[03:02:53.520 --> 03:02:56.900]
And he would cross-frame to get all trim and fit.

[03:02:57.400 --> 03:03:01.580]
And one thing that he would not eat, he would not eat shit.

[03:03:01.580 --> 03:03:02.520]
Shut your mouth.

[03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:05.020]
Talk about Jesus' would need.

[03:03:08.360 --> 03:03:09.880]
Uncle Benz can burn the rice.

[03:03:10.320 --> 03:03:13.220]
He seeks me a heathen cheese burger in paradise.

[03:03:13.720 --> 03:03:14.540]
Chicken Alla King.

[03:03:14.880 --> 03:03:16.880]
Holy Allah, Pope Yes Chicken.

[03:03:17.340 --> 03:03:17.820]
What?

[03:03:18.640 --> 03:03:19.860]
Pope Yes Chicken.

[03:03:20.700 --> 03:03:22.960]
I think he means Pope Yes Chicken.

[03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:24.080]
Pope Yes Chicken.

[03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:24.840]
Oh, Pope Yes Chicken.

[03:03:24.920 --> 03:03:25.500]
Oh, I see.

[03:03:25.640 --> 03:03:26.500]
Did I do that again?

[03:03:26.680 --> 03:03:27.700]
I missed that red thing.

[03:03:27.700 --> 03:03:32.240]
He was a carpenter, but their diet would not do.

[03:03:32.800 --> 03:03:34.820]
Carren's carpenter's diet ain't proven.

[03:03:35.260 --> 03:03:36.520]
Isn't good for you.

[03:03:37.780 --> 03:03:41.140]
He would meet Kees just to prove he was a real man.

[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:46.160]
And since he was raised Jewish, he'd have to pass on the heavenly hand.

[03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:50.700]
That's what Jesus would eat.

[03:03:52.200 --> 03:03:52.580]
Oh!

[03:03:52.580 --> 03:03:53.940]
Oh!

[03:03:53.940 --> 03:03:56.380]
Oh, my God.

[03:03:58.400 --> 03:03:58.580]
Oh!

[03:04:01.080 --> 03:04:01.080]

[03:04:01.100 --> 03:04:01.100]

[03:04:01.100 --> 03:04:01.100]

[03:04:01.100 --> 03:04:01.100]

[03:04:01.100 --> 03:04:01.100]

[03:04:01.100 --> 03:04:01.100]

[03:04:01.100 --> 03:04:01.100]

[03:04:01.100 --> 03:04:01.100]

[03:04:01.100 --> 03:04:01.100]

[03:04:01.840 --> 03:04:01.840]

[03:04:01.880 --> 03:04:01.880]

[03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:09.400]
Oh!

[03:04:09.540 --> 03:04:09.540]

[03:04:09.640 --> 03:04:09.640]

[03:04:09.640 --> 03:04:09.640]

[03:04:09.640 --> 03:04:09.640]

[03:04:09.640 --> 03:04:15.500]
Yes, you should have known, but now we got this color.

[03:04:16.020 --> 03:04:17.880]
The challenge went a thread as near.

[03:04:19.880 --> 03:04:23.480]
This killed a counter-person who believes that we got hit once.

[03:04:23.780 --> 03:04:25.540]
The next one will be more severe.

[03:04:26.580 --> 03:04:26.900]
Yes.

[03:04:26.900 --> 03:04:29.060]
But I guess you must be dumb.

[03:04:29.600 --> 03:04:33.540]
When you say that this new system really needs to be refined.

[03:04:34.900 --> 03:04:36.780]
My talk to cream means alright.

[03:04:37.320 --> 03:04:39.440]
And orange means a title you say.

[03:04:39.780 --> 03:04:45.360]
What if I'm colorblind on the acid when it's red, big red?

[03:04:45.880 --> 03:04:48.900]
Oh, baby, I'm much too much.

[03:04:49.940 --> 03:04:53.160]
Yes, you are when it's red, big red.

[03:04:53.160 --> 03:04:58.760]
And it's bad for you because you can follow us.

[03:05:01.020 --> 03:05:04.140]
Bye, bye, bye!

[03:05:04.520 --> 03:05:09.200]
To meet with your show on Climax, you will be QAF Miami for Margaille.

[03:05:09.480 --> 03:05:10.800]
Let's get wild.
