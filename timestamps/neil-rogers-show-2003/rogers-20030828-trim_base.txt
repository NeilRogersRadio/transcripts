You have to suck up to the locals including my good friend the Pat Riley, I understand I love riles

[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.780]

[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.060]
I was

[00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.480]

Most of pomp is asked 37% he's effing boring 30%

[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:46.740]
I don't give a shak diesel about sports 19% I do listen. He's fabulous 8% that means if you have every listener in Miami

[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.620]
What you do that means that 8% of Miami likes him and 92% of Miami thinks he's a douchebag

[00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.760]
Absolutely correct. His muskrat is on to type 4% the beast is his muskrat 1%

[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.800]
What is that 10? Yeah, it tells me we've got a problem. They hate your mall. They hate you

I think great reading these to call George and see if he wants to write me another child

[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.540]

I don't understand. I'm like

[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.760]
Whenever these GMs come around me the stock is so small it's like it's bridged a midget a tootsie

[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.960]
He told me that you're making very nervous. I nervous this your ass makes me nervous

You won't see me for five whole months

[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.720]
I'll be downstairs getting drunk

[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.660]
Watching tackle sticks and puns for the joy

[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:41.140]
But fall season has begun and I won't be seeing you till the season is all through

[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]
I will miss you with all my soul

[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.760]
But I'll return after the superboats

[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.080]
I guess I'm just a football

[00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:04.480]
For the next 21 weeks come upstairs just to take leaks no more life

[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.400]
No more sun with false season has begun when they run when they pass

[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.200]
I'll be cheering passing gas for the joy

[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.260]
Oh

[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.320]

Ten away to five sixty wQ. I'm so into a clearance who of course is a real sports nerd

[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.780]
Well, this week's yours flown by hasn't it not

[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.160]
For some of us so the people from critter control found a dead rat in the traps in my attic

[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.680]
I should have thought of that big one. Yeah, should have thought of what big ass rats

[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.600]
They're everywhere they have a big ass and the rest of them too. Yeah

[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.600]
So they really can't make that much noise. Oh, yeah

[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.400]
Well, I'll be damned especially when they're chewing through the ceiling

[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.360]
They put on the trash

[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.840]
I give up peanut butter. Oh, yeah, yeah. Why is that?

[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.100]
They put like

[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.980]
Extra trying out gets hard and loses its aroma peanut butter is oily

[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.080]
It gets hard hardest twelve inches in football

[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.880]
Peanut butter is oily and it smells

[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.120]
Like all that bacon. I yesterday ate it like a how much is a rasher of bacon do you know?

[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.260]
I've heard that expression so many times. I have no idea what that means but whatever that is I ate it and

[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.900]
Man oh man what that did to my back though. Whoo. Did I pay a wicked price for that?

[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.920]
I why did they do and they did it again today but being

[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.520]
Wising up and I wanted to go through that again

[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.660]
They're not dead. It's nothing but well, that's how is we love you

[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.180]
But they cut the crap already you know like 60 slices of bacon will be enough

[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.820]
That stuff is nothing but fat and grease and a pork pork

[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:02.880]
Oh, do I have a lot for that but I'm not gonna say it because I have I'm holding right here a letter from the very ultra religious right wing

[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.380]
John black and Ford Lauderdale

[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.300]
Who's been writing this crap for years to the Sun Sentinel say you know see that's what so boring about this town

[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:18.540]
It's the same old colors and the same old letter writers to the editor and the same old get skis in the same crap man

[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.640]
We need some new blood. How many years have I been saying that that's why Forell is doing so great

[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.780]
Even if he shows sucked which it doesn't but even if it did he's new he's different. He's off the wall something different

[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.380]
We need some variety

[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:39.300]
But some in man, but get bust loads of like real living and breathing people in here and crank the humidity down about 80%

[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.040]
Of course we'll have to bust some people out tonight. I of course

[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.040]
Including all the old Jews and old Cubans yeah, I go out to get the newspapers this morning

I'm telling you seriously it was so humid how humid was and so goddamn hot and like at seven o'clock

[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.100]
How and humid can it be at seven o'clock in the morning?

[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.720]
How hot you want it? Oh

[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.700]
Unbelievable how how can anybody be here?

But the evidence of Labor Day weekend is upon us because it's been pretty thin the last week and a half but now

[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:18.200]
Oh anybody who was finally bailing out to enjoy long holiday weekend. They're gone and back up to three near death experiences

per day this year's that there was like nobody in fact

[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.360]
You know when I came to a dead man's curve there by the stadium

[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:30.340]
That's what I call it now dead man's curve I was very wrong by the stadium where there's no traffic light and you hope you can make that left turn on

[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.180]
The Ives deri that's the one you wiped out on is it?

[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.860]
No, that's the one you get on the turnpike okay or off the turnpike

[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:41.200]
No, no, this is this is where you come to the end of the road by the stadium and you have to make the left turn Ives deri

[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.680]
There was nobody going either way nobody

[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.340]
Until you got like right up to that school when people were whipping to the schools on about 80, you know

[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.780]
What I'd like to do is an excellent driver

[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.880]
I'm just like a tiger

[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.540]

There's an excellent driver

[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.000]

[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.800]
Well, I do not for game marriages

[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.280]
And domestic partnerships

[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.240]
And I'm for a...

[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.540]
I mean, well, what is it?

[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.660]
I get weak, why am I starting with this now?

[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.460]
I don't know

[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.800]
I really do, I make myself weak thinking about

[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.320]
How goddamn stupid people are

[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.480]
They take some moron, who's...

[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.560]
Inarticular would be the understanding of the centuries

[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.120]
A literate, he's an asshole

[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.220]
He's nothing but a goon

[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.340]
Who represents the dumbest of everything that's dumb

[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.340]
He wasn't even born in his goddamn country

[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.200]
His father was a freaking Nazi

[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:49.860]
Yeah

[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.980]
And other than that, he never stole a freight train

[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.100]
So let's make him governor

[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.020]
He knows that bush

[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:55.900]
I beg your pardon?

[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:56.800]
What'd your brother have?

[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.280]
I'm old

[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.480]
At least there's some time we're there

[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:00.820]
Right

[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.580]
Anyway, 16,860 for abandoned perrescue

[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.000]
We did the 14-a-re bucks yesterday at Brandes

[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.740]
Thanks to our friends at Brandes, by the way

[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.960]
For allowing him a gallon-toy's transfer to be there

[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.800]
By the way, Troy Stratford told me something shocking this morning

[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.160]
He said that Dan Marino had the smallest penis of any player he's ever seen in his life

[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.360]
He said he was hung like a butterfly

[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.220]
And you know, Troy did play with Dan

[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.800]
And also was on the same...

[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.520]
Was on the same football team

[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.000]
He said he played with him a little bit

[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.540]
How many times?

[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.780]
About 30, man

[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.480]
He said nothing ever came of that

[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.940]
So anyway, Dan Marino hung like a midget according to what the great Troy Stratford

[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.000]
The phenomenal dolphin running back during those grotesque awful years

[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.200]
But I was pretty shocked that it came out with something that openly, you know

[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.880]
Nice going, Troy. We always liked you

[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.360]
So by the way, 16,860 for abandoned perrescue

[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.160]
And the best of meal stuff

[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.400]
And what happened to the sheet that he was going to give me?

[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.860]
I mean, he gave me the thing with the number

[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.700]
What happened with the thing about Joe and Mark going out at noon to two?

[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.260]
This Miguel, since he got married, didn't we warn him?

[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:06.940]
Oh, yeah

[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.920]
His ass is where his head used to be

[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.740]
He hasn't got a clue

[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.320]
He has ass upside down

[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.920]
Well, first of all, stopped saying new to two because I think that was why he took that sheet out of there

[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.320]
Well, when are they going to be?

[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.100]
Wherever they're going to be

[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.480]
It might be three to five

[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.300]
Oh

[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.840]
Like I said, he can't get his ass together

[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.360]
But they're going to be out somewhere with the best of meal stuff today

[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.860]
And we'll go over 17 grand

[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.040]
That's really not very bad

[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.160]
Not at all

[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.780]
Huh? Considering we're just getting started

[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.200]
Wait till October of Emberty's similar

[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.360]
It is actually some people here

[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.000]
It'll be great

[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:36.880]
Can I read this letter?

[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.800]
Well, I got to give the results of the pool even though Farrell already did it

[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.440]
And you notice he sees the opportunity to do that

[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.060]
This is a way of rubbing it in against Moe

[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:45.720]
Is all that was?

[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.040]
You're not fooling anybody Scott

[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.000]
It was a way of sticking it in Moe's back to which we say

[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.520]
Oh right

[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.120]
Yeah, nice going

[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.020]
But we'll read it again

[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:53.820]
You can never read it

[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.280]
Especially when it was such a...

[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.240]
I mean, I thought he did poorly on the play by play

[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.240]
And actually he did

[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.040]
We should have saved that

[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.020]
We had 303 votes

[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:01.540]
I remember that

[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.540]
And you notice

[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.140]
Since he was bitching yesterday about our polls

[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:06.940]
1151 on this one

[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.800]
That's four... That's almost 1500 votes

[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.620]
On a weekday when there's nobody here

[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.060]
So somebody must be out there if you catch my drip

[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.980]
Somebody must be a listener must be monitoring

[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.640]
Maybe John Black and Fort Lauderdale's monitoring

[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.500]
Yeah, he's one of those monitoring type guys

[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.300]
Same same ilk

[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.820]
He writes in the sunset letters to the editor

[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.600]
And I notice right to the right

[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.640]
And to the far right of his letter

[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.860]
Here's a cartoon

[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.920]
Editorial cartoon

[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.920]
It says 21st century America

[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.240]
And it shows a garbage truck

[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.720]
And in the back here's the thing with the 10 commandments on it

[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.800]
Is that pathetic or what?

[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.340]
Sad

[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.620]
Tragedy, and there's the zits flying out of James Woods' puts

[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.700]
Also the same garbage truck

[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.000]
Conscience class

[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.540]
John Black, chronic writer, and right-winger says

[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.140]
The only reason that so many object to the public display of the 10 commandments

[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.200]
Or any other Judeo-Christian objects

[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.540]
Has nothing to do with the law

[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.580]
These people do not want to have their consciences seared

[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.300]
Any object on this player reminds them that there's an Almighty God

[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.020]
With whom they must give an account someday

[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.920]
No, God

[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.720]
writes John Black and Fort Lauderdale

[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.360]
See that this is what you're dealing with

[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.320]
He says it therefore it's so

[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.000]
And again this Judeo-Christian

[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.680]
Do the Muslims believe in it you'll get

[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.760]
How about the Ahindus?

[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.620]
How about atheists?

[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.240]
Agnostic

[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.220]
Everybody else the Wikens

[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:24.760]
Buddhist

[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.180]
Like a Trish Tradfer with the golden boot on his head

[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:29.680]
Huh?

[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:30.560]
What?

[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.900]
It's a golden bootie

[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.620]
He's got a golden bootie that's what he said Dan Marino had

[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.840]
And a very tiny penis

[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.660]
Oh, bambooty that old

[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.340]
So anyway that's your giving idea one of the thing

[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.940]
That's what our pool is going to be based on

[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:41.940]
And this whole religious thing

[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.000]
Because there's a big thing on the front page of the hearledus morning

[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.220]
Religious battle in US's building

[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.800]
And they're trying to make this nutkin

[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.500]
In fact look at that

[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.560]
A centerpiece for so long

[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.120]
Judge Morris is spending this

[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.220]
Keep justice in Alabama

[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.080]
Excellent

[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.780]
He's charged with defying a court order

[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.940]
Good I hope they throw his stupid ass in jail

[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.900]
And all these nutcases can

[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.720]
What is Brian Cabelegan on CNN?

[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.700]
Keep justice Roy Moore was expected to appear here with the podium

[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.560]
Scheduling conflict he will not be here

[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.940]
Then at one o'clock, central time, there will be a filing, a refiling of lawsuits

[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.820]
In district court here in Montgomery

[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:17.260]
And at 10 o'clock, once again, we get the money went back in

[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.780]
Yeah, they just won't take no for an answer then

[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.880]
In other words, forget about the Constitution, we got a better document right here

[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.780]
We got the Bible says this and we're going to force it on you

[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.060]
Whether what you want it or not

[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.660]
As solely that a Brian would say, we're going to force it and hoist it

[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.000]
Crazy anarchists

[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.320]
Yeah, they're crazy people

[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.960]
This is one of the biggest problems in this country unlike just about any place else that I go to

[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:44.180]
This is supposed to be so superior in some and come to find out this country has taken gigantic steps back in the dark ages

[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.060]
And of course just like everything else it starts at the top

[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.620]
If the fish is rotten at the head, right?

[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.460]
Sure

[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.300]
If you find something rotting in the head, crap rolls down hill

[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:54.960]
Right

[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.120]
And that's what we got in this country starting with a religious nut up there

[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.820]
At least under the name of religion all over the rest of it is all like more hanky-panky and big business and big bucks

[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:07.600]
Of course that's what religion is anyways, nothing but big bucks, tax-free big bucks of course

[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.920]
The biggest scam in the world, okay, I'm not going to get all whipped up, yes I will

[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.460]
Please

[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:18.120]
You know, I thought for a few seconds about maybe today going back to the one to two not playing the comedy hosts

[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.480]
I thought about that for a few seconds

[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.340]
Thought third man

[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.000]
And I said, are you out of your mind or what?

[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.460]
Come on out because there's nobody here now

[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.080]
No, because it's really, I don't know, it's kind of like I feel like we're cheating

[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.060]
Like we're just faking our way through which we are

[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:31.640]
Absolutely

[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.340]
Until next week till after Labor Day, but you know, I feel like we're sure changing the audience a little bit

[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.200]
And you know what?

[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.300]
Tough crap

[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.120]
They're sure changing us

[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.060]
Yeah, they've been doing that for a long time so now pay back as a bitch

[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:48.040]
And there's nothing wrong with those comedy, but I've tried to mix it up a little bit, put some good crap in there

[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.020]
Old stuff

[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.540]
I was starting to squirm around in the chair, I shouldn't have eaten all that big

[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.400]
Oh, you should have stopped me yesterday, that's bad

[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.860]
You should have come right in here and said, are you out of your ever-fake in mind?

[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:57.840]
I ate one of the pieces

[00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:58.800]
Yeah

[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.140]
And I ate about 50

[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.160]
Right

[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:08.400]
Oh, in some other words, that was the favor you would do if I ate in one maybe that one would have been the last one to rip my ass open

[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.840]
Oh, I can't think of the thing I did

[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:18.360]
I'm not going to be the ointment and the suppositories, the inesol, the soothing balm

[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.500]
Man, and just shove it all in like, oh brother, I'm serious

[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:27.060]
Last night I had a major exclamation project to try to like get all that stuff back together again

[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.620]
Oh, brother, there is nothing like Roy, he doesn't have a bidet, do you?

[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.180]
No, I do not have a bidet

[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.820]
Even up there, I don't have a bidet

[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:34.440]
I do have a soothing relief

[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.680]
Although I do have like a whirlpool thing up there

[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.600]
But I don't have a bidet

[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.140]
I highly recommend that you should probably have bidet

[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.080]
Days like that

[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.680]
When a doubt washed that thing out

[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.440]
So at any rate, quit eating all that bacon

[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:53.240]
I have some good news though, some sensational news for this audience about something you can eat

[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.440]
Not too much of, don't overdo it, don't use it as an excuse to get carried away

[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.620]
No, I'm serious, what the hell was that?

[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.160]
Is it like, oh yeah, like, like, like, like, like, oh, I'm coming to work this morning again

[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.260]
I can get almost to here and it's getting real dark, which is not unusual, it's this neighborhood, you know

[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:12.940]
But it's getting really dark, it looks like there's tornadoes on the way like the end of the world out there

[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.820]
And show enough now I can hear it out there

[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.620]
Thunder and lightning and crap and rain

[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.460]
What did I just get through, Tonya? This is not a place

[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.300]
This is hell

[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.880]
This right here, your ass is burning in hell

[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.160]
Believe me, maybe that's what happened to me when it wasn't the bacon after all

[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.060]
Boy, this is a horrendous place

[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.780]
Well, why don't you get out of here if you're like, okay

[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.920]
Okay, no argument for me

[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.820]
Soon

[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.720]
That does sound pretty ominous out there, don't I?

[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.340]
Yeah, it does, it sounds like it was just rattling like a nuns

[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.040]
Nons were bowling like in the, leaving a lot of 10 pins

[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.580]
26 pat, we're looking at a 710 split, damn it

[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.580]
26 after 10 at 560 WQM, do you have kids going back to college?

[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.660]
Well, let's show how about giving them one of the comforts of home, a new bed from Dallas mattress

[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:12.380]

You must do this if you want to practice your big young man

[00:22:54.020 --> 00:23:03.840]
There's a place you can chill I said young man if you're a $3 bill you can't rate it and then you make convert

[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.640]
They won't treat you like a pervert

[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:18.660]
It's fun to pray at the a-pay, it's no culture, it's fun to pray at the a-pay, it's no culture, yeah

[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:25.440]
All right then you fish up snazzy and there is no doubt, he's one of your friends said

[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:34.100]
I'm a sponsor pray at the a-pay, it's fun to pray at the a-pay, it's no culture, yeah

[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:41.520]
They too not persecute, you can worship in peace, you can marry a girl named Steve

[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:49.180]
A bitch, a culture, it's fun to stay at the a-pay, school full church, yeah

[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:49.560]
Okay

[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:57.700]
Young man, we will let you run in, young man, we sing shows who's not here

[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:01.560]
A heart is twelve, it's visit, booklaw

[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:08.620]
1033 at 560 WQM, so how he and Delray beat you, it's me and says, russia, here's the definition right from the old dictionary

[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:09.280]
Oh, an athlete

[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:16.420]
A thin slice of bacon or ham for frying or boiling or a second definition, a portion or serving of such slices

[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.560]
So that was more than a russia

[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:25.480]
No, but I mean in other words a russia doesn't necessarily mean a specific number, it could be like couple or it could be

[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.400]
About third man

[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.740]
A bunch like I yesterday, that was disgusting

[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.480]
I mean it was delicious, yeah

[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:36.140]
It was sensational, but just a little bit over the top and under the bottom

[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.520]
So I interrupted myself which is good because I haven't given a result from yesterday's poorly yet

[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.660]
It's already almost 1035, you see there's a method my man is taking this

[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.760]
I never even talked about the dark chocolate thing, so I said I had good news

[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.160]
So this is great

[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.440]
I wouldn't say it's great but it sure is very effective in killing time

[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.380]
No dark chocolate which I have to do one of those people who likes my chocolate dark

[00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:00.180]
I like my people a little on the lighter side, but I like my chocolate dark

[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:06.680]
In fact, anybody darker than Malcolm, I would say hey you may be a very nice guy but see ya

[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:11.080]
You know, I like my guys much more on the lighter side, not pasty

[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.600]
What? Like me?

[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.100]
Oh, oh, no I don't ghostly

[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.760]
Yeah, I always ghostly

[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:25.680]
But anyway, so dark chocolate the new skin and of course you're always skeptical about this because every few months they're coming out with some skin

[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:32.560]
Tomato sauce, tomato products, good for prostate cancer, for preventing against prostate cancer

[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.980]
All this stuff you know

[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.800]
And it's always in the back of your mind you're thinking well they're trying to pedal some crap

[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.100]
Now the new daily other day red wine if you drink red wine it makes you live longer

[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.580]
And also probably bad for your roids I would think

[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:51.000]
I don't think now is the time because actually there are lots of wines that have only two or three carbs in like a glass

[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.060]
You don't want to get the sweet fruity wine

[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.580]
No you want a nice dry red wine

[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.460]
Try the wine?

[00:25:59.260 --> 00:25:59.800]
I never drink

[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.840]
He and Bella could have been good in the clockwork orange too you know

[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.800]
I lost that cart, we lost those in the mix

[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.640]
I never drink fine

[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.120]
Which they did bring that back in the Edward

[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.720]
Edward is good but like I said watch half an hour of it and then go have a good time

[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.380]
No because it's just the same thing

[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.500]
Eddie, Eddie, come help me Eddie

[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.680]
I've got a problem over here

[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.720]
In fact I wonder if Bella knew a beater boy

[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.760]
So at any rate what was I just saying about the dark chocolate?

[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:28.180]
Yeah

[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:34.980]
So the new thing after the red wine right on the heels of that there's a story in the American medical, the urinal or whatever it is about

[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.380]
Dark chocolate, eating like three ounces

[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.660]
Of course you do realize how much like you see that those two fingers

[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.780]
That's it, that's three ounces

[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:44.680]
Not a lot

[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.760]
As with anything moderation

[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.940]
Dark chocolate will lower your blood pressure

[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.560]
And I thought yeah sure right

[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.400]
So luckily in Walgreens, of course they end please

[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.460]
All you people out there do not buy Hershey's chocolate

[00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.340]
It's American, it's generic

[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.880]
It's some of the worst crap you'll ever have in a history of your life

[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.000]
Anybody that eats Hershey's chocolate must have real good taste

[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.140]
Don't kind of say that right now

[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.820]
It is so bland and it's also like Waxi, you know what I mean?

[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:10.300]
No I know

[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:11.480]
Waxi build up

[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.760]
They have different kinds but there are so many better kinds than Hershey's

[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.360]
No, don't you understand what I'm saying?

[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.220]
Don't eat Hershey's chocolate

[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:21.680]
Period, okay

[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.100]
No, if you're going to eat chocolate eat good chocolate

[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.660]
Oh I agree, don't eat crap

[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.980]
It's like if you're going to eat spaghetti don't eat Franco-American

[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:29.800]
I've never seen

[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]
Don't eat Franco-American out of your can

[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.640]
No seriously I mean how hard is it to throw some pasta in a pot and the

[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.560]
Schmerzler sauce on it and the same with chocolate

[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.120]
You go into anywhere you go into a convenience store you go into Walgreens

[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.020]
You go into a public anywhere you got like all kinds of chocolate now

[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.960]
Yeah but sometimes you're at a friend's house and that's all they have

[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.420]
Well it gets a new friend

[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.960]
If your friends only have Hershey's chocolate and offer say

[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.360]
Fett and walk right out and slam the door in their face

[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.520]
You know everybody has a part in the bowl of Hershey's kisses

[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.200]
Like on their coffee

[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.500]
Dude, everything like that

[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.280]
It's crap!

[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.020]
Why don't you get your hand out of there?

[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.720]
I dive into the bowl all the time

[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.680]
Oh Hershey's kisses that is

[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.200]
Whatever

[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.600]
It's like a bio

[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.660]
You're going to take this one over a bio

[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.560]
They're everywhere

[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:13.580]
Vanilla

[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:13.880]
Sure

[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.460]
The same people like vanilla ice cream or like Hershey's chocolate

[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.060]
This is a lot of people you know it's crap

[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.060]
Anyway what I was starting to say is dark chocolate

[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.060]
So I go to Walgreens last night thinking

[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.000]
Well this is a really good idea let me test it out

[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.140]
Because when I'm back here my blood pressure is a little bit higher than like when I'm in Toronto or anywhere

[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.660]
Or like an Amsterdam anywhere but here

[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.740]
Because first of all here I got a drive

[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.840]
I got to come here and put up with all the idiots here

[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.640]
And I got to do this you know

[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.520]
In this studio is opposed in the lap of luxury in my Toronto apartment

[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.400]
Right next to my bedroom

[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.220]
So my blood pressure is a little bit higher or nearly

[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.040]
So I thought I went in doubt I'll check this out

[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.840]
So I go and I'm looking through

[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.480]
As in any drugstore now they've got a phenomenal selection of candy

[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.280]
I mean every kind of candy, at least in America

[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.980]
And American candy is pretty weak

[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.420]
Canada does have much better candy and ice cream

[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.240]
And government

[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.680]
And lifestyle

[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.760]
And the bowling and curling and hockey

[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.780]
But at any rate

[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.020]
So and drugs

[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.580]
So I go down to candy aisle and look at here

[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.940]
First there's Hershey's and obviously a lot of people out there saw that on the news

[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.980]
Because they're Hershey's dark chocolate

[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.280]
You know how they have those big bars?

[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.580]
The kind that are supposed to like be for a whole family that I can eat in two minutes?

[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:25.980]
You know they're on the other side?

[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.180]
Oh yeah

[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.900]
So they have the regular ones

[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.880]
And they're like all stacked up the whole thing is full

[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.200]
And then it's Hershey's dark chocolate with the same big one

[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.040]
And there's only one the one I was in the front

[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.620]
And it will be everything behind it is empty

[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.000]
Well I look at that and I turn my nose up and say

[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:38.740]
Faa

[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:39.280]
To that

[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.580]
But I'm looking and looking and I see

[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:42.580]
Dove

[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.920]
Extra silky dark chocolate

[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.540]
And these little thin bars

[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.360]
We buy the bags that have the individual

[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.560]
But the same thing

[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:52.240]
You listen to me

[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.340]
Little thin bars so I get two of those which couldn't have been more than ounce max

[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.260]
Okay

[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.760]
And they are delicious

[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.100]
Delicious

[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.020]
Although listen don't

[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:07.920]
Now see they also say like with a dark chocolate if you eat the kind that's like 7.0 cocoa

[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.500]
Whatever it doesn't raise your blood sugar

[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.220]
But it also tastes like baker's chocolate

[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.100]
You know what that tastes like?

[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.080]
Oh, bitter. I like bitter sweet

[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.260]
But this is like bitter bitter bitter

[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.980]
Ooh nice there's a threshold

[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.780]
So don't assume that if you go and get the doves silky chocolate like I get that it's gonna like

[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.380]
Send your sugar up a little bit not not dramatically unless he tons of it

[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:31.340]
But the good news is that I'm sitting there and I'm taking my blood pressure like every half hour

[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:35.480]
Just just to see do my own little clinical test if this really works

[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.400]
And you know what it did?

[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:37.180]
It worked

[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.720]
And my pressure this morning was the best it's been in in days since I've been back here

[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.100]
139 over 82 before my pills that's not bad

[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.000]
Not bad at all

[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.340]
No

[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:54.480]
And that's thanks to my goddamn love of extra dark extra silky extra delicious chocolate

[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.960]
So you're gonna get chocolate get paragena get what was the kind you were talking about?

[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.840]
Lendor which is great that's from Switzerland or from wherever it is

[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.080]
Or good diva

[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:05.720]
Oh yeah

[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.920]
Or paragena from Italy

[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.280]
Get some good stuff don't be eating like Hershey's chocolate

[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.280]
The liquor store has all these gourmet chocolates we have

[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:20.300]
I mean even the goyum will laugh you out of town and if they catch you eating Hershey's chocolate

[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.900]
They win awards every year

[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.880]
Those are the ones that you're asked to out who does Hershey's

[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.320]
For what?

[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.400]
For their chocolate

[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.220]
For a scam the regular bar

[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.280]
Get out of here you're crazy

[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.400]
It tastes like wax

[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.160]
It tastes like wax

[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.240]
It tastes like it has a paraffin coating on it

[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.980]
Are you with the people in the McDonald's too?

[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:41.960]
Just because more people eat crap you say that

[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.060]
It's more of its garbage

[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:47.020]
Hershey's chocolate should be outlawed they win awards

[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:47.800]
So?

[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.760]
So does the Cindy Lauper

[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.020]
What does that mean?

[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.300]
wins awards

[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.340]
So they puffed the P Diddy win awards

[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.760]
1155 votes on yesterday's pool

[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.680]
There should be a special award for Moe for this pool what a job he did

[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.320]
That's two polls in the same day that he just absolutely crapped out

[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:07.900]
Wow

[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.720]
Why don't you listen to the Moe Howard David and Joey asked yesterday?

[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.860]
1155 votes this was the second pool of the day it's tremendous turnout

[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.440]
He's a pompous old ass 440

[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.560]
What's that just might have been the correct answer?

[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.240]
Absolutely

[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.500]
He's effing boring 354

[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.180]
I don't give a shmit about sports 219

[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:31.760]
I do listen he's great 94 which is only 8.1%

[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.460]
8% of this audience

[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.440]
Which means 92% like Ferrell said think he's a piece of crap

[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.180]
And his muskrat is on to tight 48 people said that

[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.460]
A grotesque showing two polls for the price of one on the same day for the Moe man

[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.760]
Boy they hate him like poison

[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.520]
Night like rat poison 19 before 11 at 560 W.C.

[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.380]
And we got Joe Rose for the mad dog a two in spider George keeps trying to make me change the schedule

[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.120]
It's the little dog on today too

[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.980]
Hey the mad dog is in New Orleans man

[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.080]
He's having a few green lizards and purple lizards

[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.560]
Purple people eaters right now with the old Moe man

[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.040]
Trying to forget their troubles and then of course we got the 800 hour adult in pregame show

[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.280]
Because we get a lot of spots in there starting at 4

[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.460]
Kick off at 8 the pregame shows at 4

[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.000]
And the only reason we're doing that

[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.500]
Absolutely

[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.060]
It's because we can make a crap load of money in there

[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.840]
We're like how many spots and hour we run

[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.840]
About 30 man

[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.240]
During that pregame show because it's just filler just to run wild spots in

[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:36.160]
18 before 11 at 560 W.C.M. if you're underpaid if you're overworked under appreciated

Maybe your mom is a crack hole

I'm not putting that in the spot like Ferrell

[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.240]
Do you hear him do that?

[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.280]
No because you know listen

[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:41.900]
Well he did

He wants to change his life

A baby and a wife

God knows what his kid has in store

[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.120]

And when he beats he sits not stand

[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.020]
The hardest 12 inches in football

[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.440]
12 minutes before 11 at 560 WQM

[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.060]
How do you like that?

[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.080]
Everybody's got 12 centimeters

[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.740]
In fact, look at that number one about voting a poll 12

[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.780]
That's the magic number if I'm you are the double is going to be one two

[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:58.760]
Got it?

[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.460]
Final score in a game?

[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.520]
Whatever game you're betting on?

[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.320]
12 to something?

[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:03.840]
12 to 12

[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.120]
Here's the new poll generally speaking

[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.240]
Which religious group in the US is the most fanatic?

[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.280]
Now I have a listing here and I may have left some out of only got five

[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.200]
Born again Christians have got 12 out of the first 15 votes

[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.320]
See the audience is clever they realize that Eric swaps the poll on there like you know in the middle of the hour

[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.860]
And so they like to hop on there right away which is good

[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.220]
Muslims too

[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.060]
Catholics one

[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.940]
Mormons don't have any orthodox Jews have none so far

[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.560]
Although the orthodox Jews of course are

[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:44.640]
I can't even find a word for it but nevertheless I'm talking about the real Getskis like Julie Raman that crowd right and your former accountant has got the tallus and the Tiffil and all that crap

[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.020]
Certainly qualified but more subtle than the other

[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:51.720]
Nests you mean like what you throw a brick through your window in Brooklyn because you're not a orthodox that's pretty subtle

[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.580]
No but like the

[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:59.420]
On the news right now well at least the orthodox Jews aren't killing any abortion doctors yet no yet

[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:07.740]
So it's like coalition get all that whole thing about monkey see monkey do you think I left any religion off that poll

[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:14.500]
Since this is the area of expertise I think you got the fanatical ones covered yeah born again Christians Muslims Catholics

[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.380]
Mormons or thought and maybe even Mormons don't belong on there although

[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.420]
They do run around on those bicycles trying to convert every in the northwest

[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:26.500]
Where you wield power oh and you talk right and the environments in the small

[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.320]
Yeah, you're right like I said that definitely believe

[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:34.100]
You're just gonna ask or in snatch he'll tell you now what about the other ones that come around with a watch tower what is that they're

[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:34.580]
They're

[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.580]
Witnesses but oh no that's right to go with this but they're they just

[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.180]
Just still run away yeah they look at their

[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.440]
Bad like the crazy people on the street corners

[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.160]
I want to say it again boys and girls listen to me very carefully

[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:54.200]
Because you see him in Toronto any big city New York Chicago any like large real city of course this is not in that we don't have a real city here

[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:58.360]
But you'll see them on street corners in the downtown areas and

[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:05.820]
They're always how is the final days are coming and get the good word and turn to Jesus before it's really and they're always crazy people

[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:12.100]
I mean they look crazy they're dressed like they just slept in a dumpster overnight that you just look at them and say oh there's a crazy person

[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:18.860]
So that bears out what I've always tried to tell you on this program is the more religious somebody is the crazier they are and

[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:23.640]
Ergo the more dangerous they are now generally the people on the street corners

[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:29.000]
They're not all that dangerous because they're out there you know they're like right in front of you and you're keeping eye on them

[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.800]
Right a lot of the rest of them they're like insects no cms

[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:39.380]
Right and if you don't see him you never know what the hell they're going to be doing like especially at the abortion doctors things like that at the

[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.580]
Applant parenthood clinic things like that

[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.440]
Look at that

[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.900]
Boy oh boy I think they hit the jackpot 35 votes born again Christians

[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.200]
29 George

[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:55.760]
Waslam's three Mormons one orthodox Jews got one and Catholics have one so everybody's got something

[00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:01.420]
Let's see pre the reason I play that bit priest abuse case dropped out this is really tragic

[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:08.340]
And I noticed that the local media once again you people in the media are a bunch of imbosils you're crazy people you I don't care what anybody says

[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:16.000]
The reason America's in the shape it is today not because of George W. Bush not because of Dick Cheney not because of the devil Rumsfeld

[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:23.780]
Not because of Richard Pearl or any of these fascists. It's because the American media which again that's the one of the most important things in bowling for

[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:29.000]
Columbine even though we kind of glosses over when he shows the Canadians and where they get their news from and are watching the CBC

[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:37.200]
As opposed to the crap that's peddled for news and the way it's presented his news now the story and the local media here about this

[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.240]
Reverend Gwyshard

[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:46.680]
Alvaro Gwyshard who was reinstated over on a beach. Oh and well the charges were dropped and there was a big petitioned

[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:51.740]
Drive and people were crying and they welcomed him back. Well, let me just read you the story from today's hero that there are a Sun

[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.460]
Settling spirit on page 5 B

[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.300]
Priest abuse case dropped

[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:04.420]
Time had expired for prosecution the date County State Attorney's Office will not pursue a criminal case against the Reverend Ricardo Castellano

[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:08.600]
Say well known priest who may least four former altar boys of accused of molesting them

[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:14.520]
Prosecutors announced this week they're unable to pursue a criminal case against Castellano's because these statute

[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:19.320]
Elimitations that run out is that the same statute that they were arguing about in Alabama? I don't know

[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:23.500]
According to Florida law if a sexual assault victim is under the age of 12

[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:29.500]
There is no time limit to file charges but the victim is 12 or older as were castellano's accusers these statute

[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.740]
Elimitations is four years

[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.240]
Four years?

[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:39.140]
Regrettably the statute of limitations laws like tying a prosecutor's hands state attorney Catherine the friend as Rundle said shorts

[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:46.100]
Even if a crime was committed in all evidence corroborated you cannot under the law prosecute it's very frustrating for victims and for prosecutors

[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.100]
It doesn't mean a crime did or didn't occur

[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:56.140]
A reviewed team for the Archdiocese of Miami has yet to decide whether the priest was suspended in May of 2002 will be reinstated

[00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:03.840]
He still faces several civil lawsuits filed by former altar boys alleging the priest molested and fondled them in the 1970s and 80s

[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:13.280]
When the Broward now here comes in a very important part when the Broward state attorney's office recently decided it could not pursue a case against the Reverend Elvara Guysard on the same grounds

[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:21.140]
The suspended priest was reinstated we shard returned to his altar in a standing ovation on Sunday he has civil lawsuits also pending

[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:25.840]
Even if Guysard has found guilty in civil court his reinstatement may stand

[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:32.940]
Civil court is civil court what our concern is what the state attorney's decision said Archdiocese spokeswoman Mary Rossa Gosta

[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:37.420]
I can't predict what will happen with the civil lawsuits have remained reinstalled as a priest and active ministry

[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:42.940]
That disappoints an attorney who filed two lawsuits on behalf of the accusers of Guysard and Castelanos

[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:47.440]
We were quite surprised because our understanding was that the statute of limitations has expired

[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.160]
It had nothing to do with the merits of the case said attorney Jeff Herman in other words

[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.960]
We don't believe the state attorney has in any way cleared father Guysard of any wrongdoing

[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:59.260]
It baffles us as to what motivated the archdiocese to reinstate him

[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.920]
They're right there there's what it's all about okay

[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:07.440]
All of that dog and pony show they put on the big meetings in Dallas and the pope of the old rope of the oak of it

[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.020]
There are all these gatherings they had in the powwow and confabs all of that crap

[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.700]
That's all it was was just a dog and pony show like I told you

[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.300]
Just to try to shut everybody up especially to Boston Globe

[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.560]
Shouldn't baffle anyone?

[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:23.880]
No it shouldn't baffle anybody because that's the thing deny and hide and lie just like Nixon said

[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.840]
You know you can always say you don't remember you don't forget and stone wall and all these things

[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.100]
Even the fags in New York never saw a stone wall like this

[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:33.520]
That's right

[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:39.860]
I got to read that last line again it baffles us as to what motivated the archdiocese to reinstate him

[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:44.600]
Because in other words it was just a technicality that the statute limitations read on nobody said he didn't do these things

[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:49.380]
In fact they had a whole bunch of very legitimate and credible allegations

[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:54.420]
But and this statement from this Mary Rasa Gosta bitch at the Catholic art sti

[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.580]
This is unbelievable

[00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:00.380]
Civil court is civil court what our concern is what the state attorney's decision

[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:07.940]
So in other words if he can't be prosecuted criminally even if civilly he's found to be liable just like old shit about any of it

[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:11.460]
They don't give a crap just get off our backs already okay leave us alone

[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.160]
See we'd like them to get off the altar boys backs is what we'd like

[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:18.100]
And fronts and bottoms and private parts

[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.140]
Good God

[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.320]
The hardest 12 inches in football

[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:22.700]
Yeah

[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:28.020]
So there you go again there's one more reason why you ought to be abandoning all this religious bull crap

[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:32.060]
If you have even just a teeny tiny brain and a willpower to say hey

[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:36.740]
I was brainwashed as a child but that's when I was a little naive stupid little kid who wasn't old enough to understand

[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.880]
Now I'm an adult I have my own mind and I'm gonna say

[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:40.880]
FAT BAM

[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.800]
To all of that crap that's what you ought to be saying they can't

[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:48.880]
Well they should and some of us can and have someone a no says emotional cripple a lot

[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:53.820]
Yeah right the perfect because they can't face the fact that we're gonna die

[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:54.680]
Oh

[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.080]
Bob hold the died

[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.160]
No he didn't

[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.420]
Well he's doing us all shows in the sky

[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:04.920]
Well I hate to say it but there's gonna be a lot of dead service people up there in the sky from new to the show is for

[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:09.120]
Because we keep having our people two more killed in Iraq yesterday standing remote thanks to our religious

[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:13.500]
Fanatic president who of course is so religious that he believes in all kinds of killing and being killed in the

[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:17.160]
Bring them on bring them on you know bring them on shoot them off all of that crap

[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:21.080]
This is this is tragic what's going on in this country right now

[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:25.380]
And here I'm getting a side about it is if I'm gonna make a difference now it's not good that's entertaining

[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.580]
We're giving me some dark chocolate my blood pressure is going on. I'll be right back

[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.740]

Now I want you to go to the orages.com

[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:41.800]
And right above the picture of that kid who's having a dream and a pitching attempt right above that maybe he's dreaming about Mo

[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.500]
There is Mo and there's all those different hairdos

[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.240]
There's the one with a condom and all these different things

[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:52.800]
They all look ridiculous and you know what most guys who have those pieces they look ridiculous

Everybody laughs at him behind their back. That's why you want to get the most amazing natural hair line system in the world for my good buddy Charles Alfie

[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:08.760]
As opposed to like maybe a dead animal that fell eight through the roof and fell on your head while you were in bed

[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.080]
That's definitely a possibility that could be how it happened to Mo

[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:16.640]
Maybe he had a muskrat in the attic it clawed its way through the roof and just like

[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.860]
Right on his head while he was a sound asleep

[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:23.980]

My name is Michael and this is 4205-60

[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.960]
But the Lord even loves neo-rogers

[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.500]
I'm a man

[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.620]
I'm a man

[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:59.160]
I'm a man

[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.860]
I'm a man

[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.660]
My fat body is right

[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.480]
I'm breaking this weight my bowels are losing control

[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.400]
Feel like a ghost in die

[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:21.180]
You're the burners we win out my home

[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:43.140]
I got a real

[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:48.840]
I got a real

[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:56.780]
I got a bad rash from a rash or a bacon

[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:02.060]
It's 11-03 at 560 or several rashers of bacon what a hell was about 800 slices

[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:07.820]
Don't do that again to me how is it really great I like the way it's really crispy like that but you'll notice it's also like real greasy

[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.880]
How are you going to get around there?

[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:16.640]
Generally speaking like for example there's the Schneiders microwave bacon which I can't find here unfortunately because

[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.340]
Cornel's microwave bacon blows it's terrible

[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:25.440]
But in the Toronto I get like Schneiders microwave bacon and the longer you put it in it gets a little bit crisper

[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:31.560]
You put it on paper towel and microwave and you put it on the paper towel and then when you're finished cooking it you turn it over

[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.240]
So the paper towel absorbs as much of the grease and schmutz as possible

[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.200]
Sure you stop it up

[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:42.500]
Yeah it's it's sobs it up but the stuff I was eating yesterday wow it's like I had like a whole bunch of valvally

[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:47.560]
Well that's an order I had a loop job for them to individually paper towel each size

[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:52.080]
Of course it's always a good idea to get a loop job before you get deeply involved

[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:56.640]
Anyway you know the people you saw the people that were like in fact the ones that are still there in my company

[00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:58.560]
They're a bunch of mug ones

[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:02.940]
I know I wrote that word down because there's no other way I can describe them

[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:07.520]
I mean there are a lot of other adjectives you could use that would be adequate but mug ones I think some set up beautifully

[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:11.720]
That's what they are they come from Kentucky and they come from places like Taylor Michigan

[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:16.220]
Which is a suburb of Detroit where all the rednecks live who have the 80 pound jar of gasoline on the TV set

[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:21.160]
And mug ones right the trailer people sure the people who watch Jerry Springer

[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:27.460]
The people that are on Jerry's exactly people that are in the audience going Jerry Jerry

[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:33.500]
Right that's the crowd the mug ones the born again a lunatic now actually these people I take that back

[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:37.220]
These people would like Jerry Springer off the ear so I take that back

[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:43.980]
No seriously these are the people would say oh that's the devil is behind that and Ozzy is born and all of that stuff

[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:44.840]
So I take that back

[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:50.800]
No I give Jerry Springer credit he has found his niche he found what he merking people wants he gives it to them and he's making money

[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.560]
It's the lowest covenant and on it he's the greatest business man that's I've ever seen

[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:03.060]
mug ones UCF Kenny says welcome back to this Schmidt hole not for long Kenny believe me I'll be out of here before you know I'll be you to here

[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:10.680]
And but he does say clearly your home is witnesses ought to be on there now the question again is generally speaking which religious group in the West is the most fanatic

[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:16.840]
Now when you go around door to door handed out them watch tower booklets and talking about how the world is going to end any minute now

[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.660]
Which when I was a little kid about a hundred years ago they were still doing the same thing and we're still all here

[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:28.940]
But they belong on there absolutely your hoax windows fanatic is I'm thinking fanatic as in malicious the word we didn't say malicious right

[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:30.760]
Oh

[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:39.160]
One we're in a hell is that we didn't say malicious no we didn't say that or even dangerous we didn't say I love that

[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:48.760]
But we said how about how much is that's him we said the most fanatic that was your own as witnesses they are committed and of course most of modaby

[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:55.660]
So there you go thanks UCF Kenny we'll get that on your Farrakis paying attention which I'm sure he has because he's really been right on top of it

[00:50:55.660 --> 00:51:00.560]
You know it's really great thanks again to Albert who created that new moat thing that's on the orages.com

[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:05.780]
Would you better check out today for a few yucks it's a beautiful thing right above the kid who's pitching the tent

[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:13.780]
But it's really a wonderful now that we you know email stuff to Eric it's on there faster than you can say hard attack you know what

[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.240]
Well I could cover a whole lot of people

[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.780]
Factor than you could say spastic attack on the flow things like that

[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:27.220]
Or like when I email them all the bedtime stories in the evening and they're on there like even sometimes before they really moaning

[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:32.580]
Nice going Eric you're doing it baby we always knew we had it in the end you we just had to embarrass you into doing it

[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:37.700]
Because it's a it's a it's a work of love it's a labor of love 129 votes on this pool already

[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:43.380]
Gee I think we're making some progress here I think we're getting some of the people back who tuned Georgia I mean we're coming back

[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:48.880]
Yeah listen there's nobody here don't feel bad you beat the crap out of mo you had a big number in here in July

[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:57.840]
Of course I figured it out I was like on half of that but at any rate see August is your this is going to be interesting when comes about the 15th of September the August month comes up

[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:06.960]
If you can hold your own in August yeah don't forget I had that hold the first week of August completely off I was in Amsterdam right chasing around all kinds of good people

[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.780]
But at any rate also you're on the last week of August yeah

[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:17.240]
Yeah but it bounced out to try to come back here and put the pieces together after you've like dropped something on the floor it's not all that easy

[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:24.900]
I mean I'm on but like I everybody's waiting around tuning in his kneel back yet plus of course the people are like you they're all gone now because I'm back

[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:34.040]
That's not true get out of here you've got your own little core of a little swingers ass liquors heterosexual fetishists you know

[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:41.680]
Drug addict drug addicts that's right people are listening because they know that every now and then you speak in code you go out the address where you're going to be a petal in it tonight

[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:54.300]
Only talk to users not abusers I see speaking a heart attack on the floor 133 votes generally speaking which religious group in the US is the most you know what I've been on today is the fourth day

[00:52:54.300 --> 00:53:01.620]
I come back to town have we had one woman call this show all week I don't think so see I've given up on at all because we have no women listen to the station

[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:09.260]
But I had a couple of factors from some ice ladies have I had one call because we're doing screenless forget about it no no seriously it's just it's amazing

[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:17.040]
I've decided we're going to talk about them not to them well that that's not very nice see another one of those heterosexuals this is once a used woman to pleasure yourself

[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:22.340]
No I used to think that's a you have no respect for women I used to have respect for women but you don't anymore then I got married

[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:28.840]
I see and that well I can understand that yeah, but you got two daughters now though that's right they have respect for one of them

[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:36.480]
The one you didn't try to stuck in the dumpster 133 votes on a poll so far I'll get to this what this is going to be great today

[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:44.160]
I don't know what it is maybe it's the fact that they found that rat in my attic of course where there's one right oh family there could be there could be mole

[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:52.500]
molelicious yeah you know what I'm saying in fact wouldn't surprise me to find one of them hair pieces lying around up in there they'll be back

[00:53:52.500 --> 00:54:00.400]
what do you mean by that I've had like five different what do you mean they'll be back I'll be back you know there was more than one there was no nest or anything up there

[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:09.360]
They're not solitary creatures I see like the rats under the shed we pisoned that shed like five times already and they still keep coming back from mole

[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:22.120]
I'll be damned well I guess you're not using exactly the good kind of poison but you don't understand what they do is they like see when you have those I don't want to get into this whole thing about pest control because it's boring

[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:34.220]
but the drain pipes on the roof you know sure well they're open they're open and that's one of the ways that they get in right but what the these critical people do is they like they put like screening on them that they can't chew through or whatever

[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:50.120]
yeah right allegedly they can chew through tungsten really yeah so don't want to help I'm gonna spend that money to have them do that because otherwise they'll take over your house oh so they're like putting a screening on into all of that so and of course if there happen to be anybody still up in there what's there aren't

[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:59.060]
because as of yesterday he was the only one who was alone the lone stranger so he's dead and I was like okay but they said it was a big one a big rat and I said was he

[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:09.200]
malicious and they said yeah they said he's from the head start program on your early morning show born again Christians fanatic the most

[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:18.660]
117 out of 152 votes I don't want to I know we have some born again Christians out there in this audience I don't want you to feel bad but we don't like you and most of

[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:25.160]
America's scared crapless of you because we know you're crazy people and we know that you won't take no for an answer that's the most scary part just

[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:31.820]
like judge more in Alabama if he wants to believe whatever the hell he wants if he wants to go read the 10 commandments in Sunday school in church in

[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:36.980]
shul where would a hell he wants fine no problem that's what freedom religion is supposed to be not

[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:42.440]
voicing it not putting it in places where it's specifically prohibited by the constitution not voicing it on a

[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:46.920]
public in public pays places which are subsidized by taxpayer money very simple there's nothing

[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:52.320]
complicated about it at all it's very simple even a mugwump a moron could understand it oh he

[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:57.020]
understand you got all these people there oh and they're all and when I love about these mugwumps is they

[00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:02.220]
they're not only leaning down and praying but they get they close their eyes and they get that real oh god

[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:08.680]
you know like like harder they pray and the more than the more they scrunch up their face the more god is going to listen to their

[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:15.900]
bull crap you know if you beat yourself with a chain that helps too that's really effective born again Christians 125 I told

but third man that's from a bit that's old dirty right that's what dirty bastard yeah

[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:41.300]
so anyway thanks so much for waiting a piece of paper you moron you we do when something comes

[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:46.680]
up if there's something good if there's something good you'll hear it on your show absolutely for

[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:51.660]
example i mean somebody and i want we need to thank whoever i pointed this out because i guess

[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:56.160]
i guess they had it in there the sportsman and people had it but until today we didn't have it

[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.900]
the hardest twelve inches in football but sooner or later we go and we grab it since they've

[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:06.060]
stolen so much from us saying i can't believe the stuff that they play in there where our

[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:12.400]
our that they play uh what uh yeah i know our stuff well see our bonuses are all intertwined with

[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:17.380]
each other so they need help oh that's obvious uncertain show is i don't want to mention not in

[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:22.700]
particular the hardest twelve inches in football generally not you know listen to that again listen

[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:27.820]
carefully the way he like kind of chuckle yeah he knows what he does well inches yeah there you go

[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:34.620]
like a dirty laugh you dirty old man you silly old kut you sunkah oh man he only wishes i think

[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:38.900]
he's got like just like me he's got the decimal point between a one and a two on that number right

[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:44.740]
hey you know something you do the best you can it breaks my heart but just one of those things

[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:50.140]
uh generally speaking which religious groups in the u.s. is the most fanatic which group

[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:56.400]
born again Christians you got it hands down everybody's pants man stop the intolerance now

[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:03.260]
stop it cut the crap i'm going to start the intolerance born again Christians 143 that's almost

[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:11.140]
74% of this audience out of 194 votes Muslims 22 see all we painted the Muslims with a broad brush

[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:15.020]
in fact wasn't it the born again Christians that were talking about their gutter religion and about

[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:18.920]
how violent they are they yeah i don't see no Muslims burning down abortion clinics

[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:23.600]
borschting abortion doctors are doing all of these things i don't see no Muslims bubbling up

[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:28.700]
buildings in Oklahoma city yeah their visuals uh the ten committees probably do the do a hell of a

[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:35.700]
job in New York but that's another story orthodox jews 20 your hova's witnesses for Catholics 3

[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:42.740]
and Mormons 2 it's because they dress so nice they're nice and neat they're nice and neat

[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:47.200]
the Mormons and vitamin a lot of those huh you've vitamin I've never had no more

[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:52.540]
they know better than to come to my house really well for several reasons two that I can think

[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:56.720]
of number one i don't want no religious notes bugging me and number two those good looking guy

[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:01.120]
mean if they're like no i check ID if they're like 18 no seriously generally the Mormons

[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.320]
look pretty good remember Steve young when he was like a kid it uh no you don't bring him

[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.520]
young no many many more and it's he look good that's Steve young huh the northwest is rife with

[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:13.240]
Mormons whoo nice like a poor young man yeah and of course they got that magic underwear to protect

[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:18.300]
their private anyway here's the facts on it johova's witnesses that said we'll get some calls on

[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:22.000]
here eventually when I get around to it we got an hour and a half to go to the big one two hour

[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.420]

lady on my intercom she dupped me for a while in the bible is what she wanted to talk about

[01:03:55.780 --> 01:04:01.380]

[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:05.760]
don't the christian nuts call themselves baptists or please stick them on a pool baptists aren't they

[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:11.660]
born again christians yes most i've got a lot of varieties of baptists but generally speaking

[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:15.680]
yeah the bad one they are fundamentalists while we're talking about the fundamentalist of baptists

[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.920]
they were the old and they were born again christians okay the dangerous people the

[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:26.120]

[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.620]
I'll be damn well, you know most people have moved to Orlando. They die

[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.860]
Yeah, that's true. Sooner or later

[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.680]
About the bird. Yes, I told you long before he was with you and

[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:53.380]
Over on the space coast want to first FM taught 40 stations. Mm-hmm out of cocoa is the BRK. Right. That's right. He was on rocket radio right he was like

[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:54.540]
Program director I guess

[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:57.880]

Go ahead don't go let him interrupt you. Okay. He's trying to get you from the grave

[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.560]
Be quiet bird. You're sure not pretty

[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:14.400]
I wish somebody out there maybe Boca Brian or somebody in the listening audience might have some tapes or something of when

[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:20.860]
He was with you. I've been listening. It's like 1990, but oh, we got a whole stack all over here long before then

[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:27.700]
Here's an idea. No, you could put those on a CD. Yeah, I put and you could

[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:33.060]
You'd buy it. No Rogers gives us the bird. You could write U.S

[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.100]
That's not too bad

[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.700]

[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:46.200]
Okay, he was okay, even though you're giving me all kinds of looks Warren and Boca says I just read this on Yahoo

[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:52.480]
Amid serious strains in U.S. Saudi relations the Saudi ambassador Washington former president George Bush that senior

[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:55.600]
On Wednesday will meet Vice President Dick Cheney today

[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:03.300]
President Bondar bin Sultan had lunch with Bush father and close confidant of the current president and Kenna Monkport main where the family is had

[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:07.360]
Long day other time vacation home. Yoddy yoddy yoddy. Well, of course they're in business together, you know

[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:13.000]
Like Genko and the Don Corleone they're in bed together any olive oil business together. They're in bed exactly

[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:18.700]
Oh, and I'm so glad he mentioned something about the most wanted deck of cards of the war profiteers cards

[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:23.220]
Yeah, that's got the Bush and Cheney and them but I'm glad Warren mentioned it because I wrote that down

[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:29.540]
This is one of the things that happens, you know, it's a it's like a chicken in the egg question

[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:32.120]
I mean where the American people really that stupid to begin with or

[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:37.340]
Does the current group of lunatics that we have in here? Are they like making them? Are they dumbing down?

[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:42.100]
Which I think both oh both of you both. I mean, we're dumb to begin with but now it's dumber than dirt

[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.280]
For example, you notice everything now and of course again thanks to the media

[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:52.160]
We couldn't have all of these things spreading like wildfire like wildfires in Kelona, British Columbia

[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.640]
Unless we had of course the media to propagate this bull crap

[01:15:56.100 --> 01:16:00.020]
I wrote down for them the actions of evil the evil doers

[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:02.600]
Deck of cards and the road map to peace

[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:10.720]
Everything is a cliche. Uh-huh. The deck of cards. I mean, it's like we're talking about some kind of a freaking parlor game or something here

[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:15.400]
Oh, we just caught the Ace of Spades and we just caused the Ten of Diamonds uh, I mean

[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:18.880]
It's like you're talking to a bunch of three-year-olds in a sandbox

[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:20.040]
Yeah

[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:27.860]
And of course when you look at the president with a deer in the headlights look and they ran the wrinkled furrowed brow and a look of confusion and contusion on his

[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:35.560]
Post you realize this is the level he can operate on he's a moron and that's a couple that's an insult to legitimate morons from coast to coast

[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.400]
He's an imbasue

[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:43.000]
And a very dangerous one he's got his finger on a button. He's spending billions and billions and billions

[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.980]
Oh, it was a great article, but I couldn't email it to Eric damn it. Where the hell did I find it?

[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:53.820]
Maybe it was on Buzzflash about the a pinak people and about this is their whole concept of what they're doing, you know

[01:16:54.520 --> 01:17:00.000]
Oh taking all the money away from social programs and funneling it all to the wealthy and the big corporations

[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.160]
For example this thing about the air pollution

[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:06.140]
Forget about yeah, of course we realize there's no such thing as global warming

[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:13.360]
Which is what we just finished with 150 degrees in all over Europe liberal conspiracy right there's no such thing as a global warming

[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:16.060]
There's no such thing as a pollution in the uh

[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:20.060]
Road erosion in the ozone layer of course not so let's just let all a big business

[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:23.680]
They'll they'll regulate themselves. That's a way to do it. Sure. They're nice people

[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:24.020]
Right

[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:31.180]
Just like our good friends at the EPA who said ah listen no problem there in New York that thing at the twin towers was a very unfortunate thing

[01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:35.280]
But the air is fit to breathe everybody's healthy and like that, you know

[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.120]
They're gagging on it

[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:41.760]
Have to be hast of course of these liars that we have in Washington. I'm gonna say it again

[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.000]
I don't there's nothing I can do I can't make any changes

[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.200]
I've just telling you the god damn truth if this was a country of people with an intellect larger than their god damn penis

[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.660]
You know I'm talking about the hardest 12 inches in football

[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:57.200]
Then there there'd be impeachment proceedings going on right now people would be foaming at the mouth

[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:03.380]
There are kids your kids. They're over there dying every day based on a pack of lies

[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:06.820]
based on a pack of total lies

[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:12.040]
Oh, but Elkider was connected with something now they actually hated each other like poison

[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:16.560]
Another coming out the news and there's that enriched uranium. Oh, yeah, and now they're trying to say well

[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.700]
They found traces of uranium. Yeah, right

[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:25.400]
You see the news reports now where our own generals are saying oh, we're making strange bedfellows of all of the people over there

[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.380]
Now the alkida

[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:31.920]
Of fragments are joining up with the what's left of the bath party right and they're forming a coalition where they weren't

[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:39.000]
Right, that's what I'm saying. That's why I keep saying that we're creating terrorism that were the threat didn't exist before

[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:44.980]
Iraq was of absolutely no threat to this country not a little bit of a threat

[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:49.960]
Not maybe someday a threat zero none and you in none of the above

[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:04.940]
No, it's all over baby for all your sweet kids

[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:19.640]

The reason of Patriots are when the Super Bowl again is here for the second time in

[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.880]
three years is because Tom Brady's got the hardest 12 inches in football.

[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.500]
Come on, it's Tildoo and by the way, this thing in California, and I don't want to sound

[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.140]
conspiratorial, but this is just part of the same power grab.

[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:05.620]
It's kind of like what Tom DeLay is trying to do in Texas with a redistricting and create

[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:09.860]
all these districts with the who sort of Republicans can increase their majority in the house.

[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.980]
And just like the way they stole a presidential election in Florida.

[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:19.320]
And now by having some right wing nutcase with a lot of money, I initiate this recall

[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.740]
thing against Great Davidson California.

[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.640]
I mean, what more would they just love?

[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:26.260]
Just love to take over to the largest state in the country.

[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:27.760]
A power grab.

[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.340]
So you see in this country, they can't do it quite as obviously quite as overtly as

[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:36.580]
has been done in some other countries.

[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.180]
So they do it covertly.

[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:42.800]
Yeah, so that we can have right wing rule for the next 100 to 100 years.

[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:48.060]
It's called a dictatorship is what it's called underline the dick part.

[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:50.940]
So anyway, I was right for once in my life.

[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:54.820]
Cadbury Schweppes in Bourneville, Birmingham, England, West Midlands, UK.

[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:59.400]
Cadbury's as we know it today started from humble beginnings in Bull Street Birmingham,

[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:03.260]
not Birmingham, Alabama, not even Birmingham, Michigan, Birmingham, UK.

[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:06.620]
A shop was opened by John Cadbury in 1824.

[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:08.400]
It didn't start as a conventionary shop.

[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:12.920]
It sold tea and coffee and homemade drinking chocolate or cocoa, which you made for

[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.300]
customer and for customers.

[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.820]
And that goes on about the whole pay.

[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.740]
Thank you very much for sending the 800 pages of history of John Cadbury and his

[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:22.340]
sons and the whole family.

[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.440]
So I was just, Brit tonight.

[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:25.500]
Yeah, he did.

[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:26.520]
American chocolate.

[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:29.620]
I mean, I'm not not going to American companies make some good food products.

[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:30.740]
I can't think of any at the moment.

[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.400]
Like Ben and Jerry's, for example, make great ice cream.

[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.340]
They're out from Vermont.

[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.680]
There's American as it gets.

[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:36.200]
Good guys.

[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.640]
Good little jugubo boys.

[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:41.020]
But chocolate, forget about.

[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.160]
Do not be no more Hershey's or go to America.

[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.540]
Nestle's I know they're like all over the place.

[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:51.660]
I think Nestle's UK, I believe is like I'm think where they started.

[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:52.320]
I'm not really sure.

[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:53.980]
Somebody have to look up the histories of Nestle's.

[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:55.960]
Nestle's is nothing to write home about either although.

[01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.320]
Nestle's does make smarties.

[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:58.880]
Nestle's makes smarties.

[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:01.620]
Yeah, but that's like which if you want to go to the parties, you go to Canada.

[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:03.240]
If you want to crappy ones, you buy them in Europe.

[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:04.760]
It's interesting.

[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:10.900]
You can get the same product in different parts of the world and it's not the same.

[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.960]
Now one thing I'll say for McDonald's and I can't say much.

[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:16.300]
But one thing I will say is they're continuing to poison the world.

[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:17.000]
Macdeff.

[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:20.920]
No, is that no matter where you go, it is exactly.

[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.840]
And I'm not saying they sell all the same products because like in Italy,

[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:27.640]
they have some pretty interesting desserts and they have to do something to lure people

[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.840]
because anybody who eats McDonald's in Italy has got to be a moron.

[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.840]
You know, it's all a great try to read as they got there.

[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:34.040]
Or an asshole tourist.

[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:35.300]
Oh, there's a big bear.

[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.520]
The bills get a big Mac.

[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:37.360]
Uh-huh.

[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:39.900]
Before we go get our spaghetti with meatballs.

[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:45.800]
But anyway, if you order a big Mac or you order like a McDonald's cheeseburger in Amsterdam

[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:52.000]
or in Berlin or in Westland or in whether it's Westland, Weston,

[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:53.100]
it's the same.

[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:53.900]
Same crap.

[01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:55.420]
Same greasy crap.

[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.080]
By the way, Bacon's bad for your ass.

[01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:58.400]
What?

[01:23:58.660 --> 01:23:59.680]
You're supposed to eat it.

[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:00.360]
No.

[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.900]
Oh, I think it's supposed to smear it.

[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:06.960]
Clarence said he always smears a little pork.

[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:11.180]
Well, anyway, getting back to a whole bunch of faxes here now.

[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.060]
What's wrong with a little pork on your butt?

[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:15.940]
Isn't that what they call it the butt end?

[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.420]
Michelle says I'd like to suggest for the list.

[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:19.980]
Seventh day Adventists.

[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.080]
This is a small potatoes.

[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:22.940]
A small potato.

[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:25.000]
I've known she says I'm a former SDA.

[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:27.940]
Continue that they're very close to reading to the Orthodox using the whole fanatic

[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:29.620]
Schmidt as a child.

[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:31.020]
There was a whole list of things I couldn't do.

[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:32.580]
That's why I just played that no dancing, Michelle.

[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:38.580]
Like I couldn't go to the theater, no TV cut my hair, no dancing, drinking, no music.

[01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:40.360]
I don't even pre-approved Christian music.

[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:41.420]
Christian music.

[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:45.600]
You know, that's depends on which family you're in.

[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.180]
How about Christian rock?

[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.420]
Even shaving was an issue.

[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:52.320]
You shouldn't shave your legs above your knees because only prostitutes do that.

[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:53.180]
Well, that's true.

[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:54.540]
And you'll castello.

[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.640]
So you can imagine underarm shaving was a major sin.

[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.280]
I could go on.

[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.180]
She says, but I'd bore you death to the crazy stories.

[01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:00.960]
Maybe not, Michelle.

[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:06.120]
It says if you haven't checked out Nick Mama LaChi show, you can go to mtv.com on air.

[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:07.140]
Newly wedged Nick and Jessica.

[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:11.360]
They have episode previews you can watch in the last episode that bitch Jessica threatened

[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.560]
to shoot off Nick's subpoenas if you were to cheat on her.

[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:14.960]
I can't stand that girl.

[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.480]
I'd rather Nick be gay than I've ended up with that stupid bitch.

[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:18.700]
I'll go along with that, Michelle.

[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.980]
I love him dearly.

[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.580]
He's I know he's got that strange.

[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:26.280]
What does there he's hot?

[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.960]
You know, some people don't have the best face, but there's something about them.

[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.580]
You know, I can't put my finger on it.

[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.740]
Anyway, Michelle says, somebody else, I'll strike up the nerve to call you.

[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:34.480]
I always enjoy your show.

[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:34.980]
Thanks, Michelle.

[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:35.840]
You're the best we'd are.

[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:40.500]
I would break her arm, though.

[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.080]
As much as I like Michelle, I break her arm before I let her touch her.

[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.840]
No, I'm got first dibs.

[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:46.440]
Let's see.

[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:47.860]
Do you remember Saunders chocolate from Detroit?

[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.000]
If you want, I'll send you some.

[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:50.300]
See, here we go.

[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.400]
Can you believe this?

[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.620]
Can you believe this killing us hardly?

[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:58.940]
With our food, all these food pushers.

[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:00.540]
Someone sent boxes of candy, you know?

[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:02.760]
I'm glad you didn't show it to me.

[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:03.400]
I don't want it.

[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:03.920]
Past tense.

[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:04.920]
I don't want it.

[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.020]
I don't want to know about it.

[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:06.720]
I don't want to hear.

[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:07.140]
Did you see it?

[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:10.180]
Just like that bitch that used to bring me to the smarties of the hockey games at the

[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:10.800]
macarena here.

[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.920]
I don't want to I got my parking passes.

[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.160]
Thanks to my friends at the Panthers.

[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:15.240]
It came separate.

[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.600]
It came like a day later, either like UPS or whatever.

[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:20.160]
So I want to be ripping them for that.

[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:24.600]
So now I got my season tickets, my parking passes, my season tickets, my

[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:25.040]
schedule.

[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:26.220]
Now all we need is a team.

[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.180]
Oh, yeah, that would be good.

[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:28.980]
Greedy.

[01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:32.680]
All we need are some like real players and a remote chance to make the playoffs.

[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:33.280]
What do you say?

[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:33.500]
No.

[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:33.980]
No chance.

[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:34.920]
No, Mo.

[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:37.020]
It's kind of sad.

[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:42.340]
And they don't even have like the big danger that Mr. Big whatever's name is.

[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:43.320]
Number eight.

[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:48.320]
So Saunders, I remember Saunders the name, but I don't think I ever had no.

[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.800]
Oh, see if we're going to get into this thing about chocolates.

[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.760]
I think back what I said about the American chocolates.

[01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:54.660]
Ethel Amos.

[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:55.180]
Oh, yeah.

[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:56.640]
Ooh, in Vegas.

[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.160]
Did you ever go to the FLM shop in the start-up house?

[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:01.960]
No, no.

[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.760]
Oh, that's where they had one there too, didn't they?

[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:05.140]
They had them.

[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:08.920]
Oh, in the start-ups they have an Ethel Amos chocolate.

[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:12.400]
They have the stuff, the crunchy, like it's like almond brittle.

[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:13.860]
Oh, I don't get me started on that.

[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.300]
Rodgers almond brittle from Canada.

[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.160]
I didn't have some of that a couple of weeks ago.

[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:17.880]
I shouldn't be doing that.

[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:22.160]
Now, didn't you say that somebody sent you some or you got some the almond brittle by Rodgers?

[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:22.620]
Yes.

[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.520]
Oh, my God.

[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:24.780]
Yeah.

[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:27.300]
Well, first of all, that should be illegal.

[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.600]
Around the sweet brittle, the nutty brittle.

[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:32.780]
And they blend in your mouth there.

[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:33.540]
What's about Ethel Amos though?

[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:34.900]
It's very, very expensive thank goodness.

[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:36.420]
But I can afford it.

[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:38.000]
And it was like orgasmic.

[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:39.960]
That was how biting my finger was.

[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.440]
Yeah, I didn't get real nervous thinking about this.

[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.160]
Like, five.

[01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:47.360]
Oh, five, that's nothing.

[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.220]
I could probably...

[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.520]
I could have polished him off, but I resisted him.

[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.700]
Oh, Rodgers almond brittle.

[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:53.400]
Go online.

[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:54.700]
Rodgers, what is it?

[01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:55.920]
RodgersTalklet.com.

[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:56.380]
See how you're doing.

[01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:57.040]
Comin' to search.

[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:57.780]
They'll find it.

[01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:58.400]
Let's see.

[01:27:58.540 --> 01:27:59.940]
Lou says, check this out.

[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:00.980]
It's all absolutely true.

[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:01.620]
Here's a bunch of...

[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:03.980]
A whole bunch of pages from the...

[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:05.680]
Oh, Lou, why did you do this?

[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:07.240]
Lou, pages and pages.

[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.720]
Silly stuff about El President.

[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.580]
They're like, ah, Lou, what are you doing?

[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:11.040]
Lou!

[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:12.520]
Can't stand it!

[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:14.700]
Can't stand people that do that!

[01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:21.300]
Oh, by the way, when you call Miguel about your CDs and cassettes and key chains and stuff,

[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:24.280]
leave your name and a phone number would be good.

[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:24.520]

[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:27.520]
If you just call Miguel and say, hi, sweetie, I'd like some crap.

[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:29.220]
You know, I might give you some crap, but you got it.

[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:31.240]
Even to get to crap, you got to leave a name and phone number.

[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:31.780]
Idiots.

[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:32.880]
Oh, boy.

[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.200]
Do we have to slow people out there?

[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:34.680]
What?

[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:39.460]
Even Troy was saying this morning because Troy went with Miguel to Brandy's yesterday on that van hit.

[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:43.340]
He said, oh, he said, are there some real interesting people in your audience?

[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:43.600]
Yeah.

[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.100]
See the good people?

[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:45.680]
They don't show up.

[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:46.480]
They're afraid, you know.

[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:47.060]
That is.

[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:48.160]
Seriously.

[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:49.880]
Well, look at the couples contest.

[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.940]
We had some damn interesting people on there.

[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:52.440]
Sure.

[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:54.420]
And then we also had some.

[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:55.520]
Anyway.

[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.360]
Other kind of, there's all kinds of interesting.

[01:28:58.720 --> 01:28:58.720]

[01:28:58.980 --> 01:28:59.980]
There's all kinds of interesting.

[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.560]
Anyway, if you want to call Miguel, 305-650-566, he is in right now as a matter of fact.

[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:06.680]
He is in, if you want.

[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:11.020]
Right after lunch, so he's going to have to serve us durin again and then in the two to three hours screw in.

[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.400]
So you might want to call him a real pronto.

[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:16.440]
305-650-566.

[01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:20.040]
It's 1157-560.

[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:22.100]
I still haven't given the whole line of parole as sports today.

[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:23.420]
Clarence will be really pissed off.

[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:26.980]
We got the Adolfins at the Saints with 50 hours of pre-game starting at four.

[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:28.320]
Countdown to kickoff.

[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:29.680]
With lots and lots of spots.

[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:31.960]
The game don't start till eight kickoff.

[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:34.260]
But we got hours and hours of crap of analization.

[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.740]
Talking about Jay Feedler, who's pretty marginal at best.

[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:39.800]
And we also have the Heracones at Louisiana Tech.

[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:41.380]
Louisiana Tech!

[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:44.700]
That's going to be like 85-2Zip.

[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:48.520]
Playing a girl's school just like the Adolfins are for the opener, the Texans.

[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:52.620]
Hercane game starts at 430-Live from the Sandbar grill in the grove.

[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:55.280]
Coverage on Power 96 on FM with like a real signal.

[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.280]
And then we got the Marlins at the Pirates.

[01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:00.380]
We got games up the old ass today on this station.

[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:03.640]
The Marlins at the Pirates who've lost 100 in a row.

[01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:06.500]
Marlins on Drek at 631-5705.

[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:08.620]
That'll be on Waxi 790-AM.

[01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:11.320]
So we got sports ass stuff coming all over the place.

[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:13.320]
Just oozing out of your radio.

[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.440]
You know, when you got up this morning, I took a deep breath.

[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.960]
What were your breathing, speaking of stuff, oozing all over the place?

[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:20.980]
If you're tired of the schmutz, the mold's for it.

[01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:22.680]
Dust particles and all the other crap in your air.

[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:27.640]
You have a mold problem called 1-866-542-4995.

[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:29.340]
That's the number for a clean air restoration.

[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.740]
I met these guys. They know how to get your air clean.

[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:38.540]
If you have a respiratory problem, allergies call 1-866-542-4995 right now.

[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:40.900]
You've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on your home,

[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:43.120]
but nothing to ensure that the area of breathing is clean.

[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:46.800]
The air filter system on your air conditioning system is there to protect the AC coils.

[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:49.080]
It's not intended to filter the air that you're breathing.

[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:53.540]
Their HEPA-FILTERed air handling system removes almost all airborne particulate,

[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:57.960]
including molds for it that can potentially produce microtoxins, animal dander,

[01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:02.140]
dust mites, it gets my dander up, insecticide dust, yeast cell, skin flakes,

[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:03.640]
and building material dust fax.

[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:08.000]
Clean air restoration is licensed and insured and their employees have been in a business for over 25 years.

[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.900]
Right now, clean air restoration has a neal deal for you.

[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:14.780]
For just 1995, they'll conduct a visual mold assessment of your house.

[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:18.780]
They'll inspect your AC unit, AC air ducts, your home interior, and your attic.

[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:22.420]
From there, they can suggest what you might need to make the air in your home cleaner and safer too.

[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:25.180]
Clean air restoration handles mold-related insurance claims,

[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.100]
commercial and residential projects too.

[01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:30.400]
So, improve the quality of your life by improving the quality of the air that you're breathing.

[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.160]
Makes sense to me.

[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:39.640]
Call now 1-866-542-4995 for a clean air restoration making your air fit to breathe.

[01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:42.340]
The air is on the wall.

[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:44.580]
This is sports radio feisty.

[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:46.180]
You weigh out.

[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:52.180]
Oh, it beat it 12-1 hour on WQM.

[01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:57.820]
You call that a penis?

[01:31:57.820 --> 01:31:57.960]
Yes.

[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:04.460]
I want to give you a kiss.

[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:05.220]
Okay.

[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.620]
Start lighting the candles.

[01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:11.860]
Absolutely.

[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.180]
There's no power today.

[01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:20.440]
And we are getting tired of it.

[01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:23.540]
New York, New York.

[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:31.460]
These electrical grids are way out of date.

[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:37.460]
Get someone to rewire it.

[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:40.500]
New York, New York.

[01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:48.300]
I don't want to wake up in a city with no AC.

[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:54.220]
And find my food as old spoiled.

[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:57.180]
Can't watch TV.

[01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:01.860]
Are these big blackout blues?

[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:12.300]
Ain't going away until they fix what's wrong with it.

[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.240]
In old New York.

[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.180]
It's a practice.

[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:21.560]
It can happen here.

[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:23.060]
It can happen.

[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.680]
Anywhere.

[01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:28.100]
What will they do?

[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:30.180]
New York.

[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.000]
New York.

[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:34.980]
Jesus Christ.

[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:39.560]
From before already at 560 WQM.

[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:40.820]
This is just flying by today.

[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.140]
Thank the Lord for that.

[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:43.080]
It's pouring.

[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.040]
It's brutal out there.

[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:49.040]
I send my condolences to those of you who've got to be here like the rest of the summer and for maybe a long time after that.

[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:49.840]
This is hell.

[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:50.420]
You're in it.

[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:50.960]
Okay.

[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:51.900]
Magnum is thick about it.

[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:52.480]
This is hell.

[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:56.440]
Joe and Mark won't be in hell, although maybe someday we'd add Cho that they're doing.

[01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:57.640]
Three to five this afternoon.

[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.640]
They will be at the singular wireless at 20335.

[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.140]
That's biscaded 20335.

[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:03.320]
Biscayne at 20335.

[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:04.760]
Biscayne Boulevard in Aventura.

[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:07.100]
And they'll have all of our good stuff.

[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.540]
They'll have the best in the LCDs.

[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:09.140]
2002-2003.

[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:14.420]
And of course the Mohawar-Davidid keychain.

[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:20.240]
And a limited supply of the 2001 CDs and the Jemandid Jemandidog keychains.

[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:23.840]
All the benefits, all the proceeds to benefit at a bad-and-pat rescue.

[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:26.200]
You can read all about a bad-and-pat rescue on our website.

[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:31.440]
And when you go to our website, neo-rangers.com, to vote on a poll or whatever else you want to do to around on it.

[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:39.160]
Be sure to take a look at the new Mohawar-Davidid flipping wig pictures, which are positively-

[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:41.880]
Now it's interesting, here's the facts, which you're nearly-

[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:44.480]
I had already thrown it in the Schmidt camp, but then I started thinking about it.

[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:47.660]
Now where is Farell going to be broadcasting from tomorrow?

[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:49.660]
Bahamas?

[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:50.760]
Yaman!

[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:51.300]
Right.

[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:55.480]
Uh, all I had to do was drink last night.

[01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:57.700]
I really don't know what the number was.

[01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:58.680]
I thought I heard him say,

[01:34:58.900 --> 01:34:59.800]
BOT 3D MAN!

[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:03.320]
He said, of course, it was all, he gets juice for everything, gets everything for free.

[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:04.780]
And more power to him, I love Farell.

[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:05.380]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:08.380]
But listen to this facts from Kenny and Mimey Springs,

[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:10.640]
who's obviously got a serious asshole problem.

[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:11.440]
Dear Neil.

[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:14.260]
After listening to the WQM for many years,

[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:17.520]
now I finally come to the conclusion that the overwhelming number of Jews who work,

[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.980]
there is led to a culture of freeloading and mooching.

[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:23.020]
The addition of Farell has taken it to a new level.

[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:28.360]
Never before in the history of talk radio has been such a feeding frenzy of freeloaders and moochers calling in for free game tickets.

[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:30.900]
It's interesting because the people who call in don't work here.

[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:32.500]
And many of them are goyem.

[01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:34.480]
And schwarzuz, and whatever they are.

[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:38.720]
It's what is even more amazing are some of the people who call in on a regular basis freeloading and mooching.

[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:42.580]
People who blatantly advertise that they're business owners, for example, and it mentions the someplace,

[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:45.080]
who obviously have enough coin to buy their own tickets.

[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:49.740]
But they would rather freeload and mooch from Farell, so they can feel like they are somebody,

[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:51.460]
namely, I socialize with Farell.

[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:55.260]
When I want to go to a game, I'll buy my tickets and take chances on who I'm going to sit near.

[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:59.000]
I don't want to know ahead of time that I'll be sitting with a cream of the crap professional Jews pick,

[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:00.940]
another assorted radio hole freeloaders.

[01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:05.720]
Funny how it took a Gentile-slash goi to blow the roof off the place and expose it for what it really is.

[01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:09.180]
So in other words, as much as we like Farell, it took Scott, given away a bunch of crap,

[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:13.800]
to expose what we've been talking about for 25 years that this is a bunch of freeloaders in his town,

[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.600]
who want something for nothing and an early bird.

[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:16.160]
Yeah.

[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:20.120]
In addition to which, since he is the Gentile goi, the token one that we got on the year,

[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:21.520]
isn't that plus the mad dog?

[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:24.380]
Isn't that a May Angel Rose? Isn't it, and the who wrote?

[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:25.700]
He wrote the big O.

[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:29.820]
Isn't it interesting, though, that he's perhaps can be a put us to shame?

[01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:30.500]
Oh, yeah.

[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:34.360]
When it comes to freeload, and I'm not going to put that, don't get me wrong Kenny and Miami Springs,

[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:37.600]
you're not going to start anything between me and Scott, because we're pretty tight, okay?

[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:43.020]
But, I mean, I mean, he goes with the territory asshole,

[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:46.580]
it goes with being in this business, is being a freeloader, and we like it,

[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:48.680]
and you're just jealous, you're just a jealous little punk.

[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.060]
That's what it boils down to, sure.

[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:54.020]
And I hope you do buy your own tickets and sit far away from all of us.

[01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:56.720]
Even George don't want to sit near we at the game.

[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:03.100]
348 votes on a poll, not too shabby, generally speaking,

[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:06.240]
which religious group of the US is the most fanatic as in,

[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:07.320]
BAAA, dangerous.

[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:10.240]
I'm going to save you, what you want to be saved or not.

[01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:14.220]
Born again, Christians, 246 over 70%.

[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:19.000]
We are mortified, and of course, and this really comes to the forefront

[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.940]
with this whole Montgomery Alabama, with a banjo on our knee thing,

[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:24.880]
with all these mugwumps, with this tent commandments.

[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:27.800]
Well, the law says, we don't care what the law says, the law of God,

[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.040]
the Lord did this, and if we can't bless God, who's going to bless us?

[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:33.440]
And if God can't bless America, be out of your body.

[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:38.420]
Muslim 38, Orthodox Jews 30, look out for them.

[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:41.060]
Orthodox those far-bistened as they say in China.

[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.280]
Do you hope his witness is 24?

[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:45.660]
Catholic 6, Mormons 4.

[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:49.240]
Now, Charles in 4, Lauderdale Beach says,

[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.680]
I haven't taken hardly any calls today, but we're getting a lot of good taxes,

[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:53.540]
so you know. Right?

[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:57.320]
Right. And maybe there's a lady on one of these lines, but it's probably retired.

[01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:58.440]
Here's line 6, hello.

[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:00.260]
Q-A-M.

[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:02.060]
Socialist Facts.

[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:02.900]
Yes, see, there you go.

[01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:04.140]
How did I know?

[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:05.860]
It wasn't him, it was the other idiot.

[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:06.960]
No, whisperer.

[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:09.020]
No, whisperer. Socialist Facts.

[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:09.740]
Yeah, that's me.

[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:12.060]
That's my name, don't worry about asshole.

[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:14.980]
Here's Charles in 4, Lauderdale Beach, who says,

[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:17.840]
hey, Neil, great pool, but the audience today really is clueless with this pool.

[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:20.400]
I think there was a period should have been earlier in that sentence.

[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:25.340]
It says, I went to school in Utah and the Mormons are the correct answer.

[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.360]
It is the Mormons who are the most fanatic religious group.

[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:30.480]
This isn't even a contest here, it says.

[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:31.500]
It's Charles. Yeah.

[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:35.740]
I think even Mo, whose approval ratings are at a staggering 8%,

[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:37.780]
would agree that the Mormons are the correct answer.

[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:40.540]
Like I said earlier, when they move,

[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:41.420]
do they move, would agree with that?

[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:42.060]
Absolutely.

[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:43.420]
Why?

[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:46.940]
Where they wield power, they can be quite an item.

[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:48.500]
They're over at power?

[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:52.140]
But it must be pretty upset about all that music they're playing,

[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:53.660]
all that jungle music.

[01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:54.460]
Actually, you're okay with that.

[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:55.160]
With what?

[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:55.600]
Music.

[01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:56.960]
Well, that's something.

[01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:59.960]
There are a lot to have dances that you can have rock and roll and dance in the room.

[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:00.120]
Right.

[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:01.560]
But only if Donnie and Marie are singing.

[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:02.880]
It says,

[01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:04.980]
PS Thank Christ for so-and-so,

[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:06.300]
a little Boeanor Boy being fired,

[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:08.020]
and the Beast is a total aspect.

[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.740]
Excellent analization there from Chuck and Four Lauderdale.

[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:11.420]
He was inside.

[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:13.160]
The Mormons are the correct answer,

[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:14.560]
even though they're lagging badly.

[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:17.200]
Well, down here they don't make too much of a wave, you know?

[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:18.780]
If you're in that area, if you're in Utah,

[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:20.820]
you practically can't get a job of it.

[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:21.880]
They're right out there by me.

[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:23.600]
They're right out there by me, the later days,

[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:24.960]
they don't control the whole area.

[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:25.860]
No, but I'm saying there,

[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.460]
I just mentioned that in Passingham,

[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:28.340]
I'm not saying they control nothing.

[01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:30.560]
They're one of a hundred churches on that one street there.

[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:32.640]
They do make a lot of money.

[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:34.640]
We've got God row out there by me.

[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:35.020]
Is that it?

[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:35.580]
They did those surveys.

[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:35.900]
Is that it?

[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:37.220]
What is it?

[01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:37.920]
It's a hiatus.

[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:41.260]
I think it's time to take a hiatus from all this religious crap,

[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:41.860]
if you ask me.

[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:43.980]
They take a hiatus from a kid of brain, okay?

[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:44.840]
Start thinking.

[01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:47.620]
Oh, well dogs don't go to heaven,

[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:49.360]
and cockroaches don't go to heaven,

[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.400]
and that dead rat that they attract in your attic,

[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:52.160]
then they go to heaven,

[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.720]
but man goes to heaven.

[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:54.240]
Right!

[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.540]
Who wrote it?

[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:56.520]
Man wrote it.

[01:39:57.220 --> 01:39:58.500]
Now in the doggy Bible, it says,

[01:39:58.760 --> 01:39:59.980]
only dogs go to heaven.

[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:02.400]
So tiny and windier up there having a good time up there,

[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:02.880]
probably,

[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:04.440]
crap it all over the clouds.

[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:06.540]
Yeah, especially tiny,

[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:07.840]
sneaking one here and there.

[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:09.180]
That's that sound we keep hearing.

[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:11.360]
Yeah, he's dropping a few tiny tots here and there.

[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:13.700]
And in the meantime,

[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:14.700]
the rest of us, wow,

[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.040]
we're just going straight into box.

[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.580]
I mean, it's so sad.

[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.000]
Just like Madeline O'Hare,

[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:20.560]
Rest in Pieces used to say,

[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:22.280]
religion without a hell isn't worth a damn.

[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:24.720]
That was one of my favorite lines she had so many,

[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:25.440]
but that's one of the best.

[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:27.460]
Religion without a hell isn't worth a damn.

[01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:30.660]
Oh, and Bob hope he's up in heaven now.

[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:31.960]
He's in a good place now.

[01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:33.860]
And a box in a ground rotting

[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:34.880]
and a worms are eating his body.

[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:36.520]
That sounds like a real good place to meet, not.

[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:37.420]
Not.

[01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:40.740]
And it sure took them a long time

[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:42.940]
to get around to this whole tribute.

[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:44.780]
I mean, how many days ago did he die?

[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:45.660]
About 30 minutes.

[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:46.900]
He's been dead for like a month.

[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:49.820]
And now they're trying to resurrect this whole crap again.

[01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:51.220]
Oh, and in fact,

[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:52.280]
and they just have the funeral?

[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:53.040]
Yeah.

[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.760]
Well, what kind of religion was he involved in?

[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.700]
They don't bury me until you're absolutely sure religion?

[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:00.580]
Yeah, and keep checking.

[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:01.340]
Maybe I'm still, I mean,

[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:02.560]
how could you really tell, you know,

[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:04.000]
if you had a pulse spoken with us?

[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:05.480]
So I'm trying to find a pulse in South Florida.

[01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:06.400]
How can you really be sure?

[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:07.200]
Well, I'm sure.

[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:08.160]
The rate none.

[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:11.240]
Well, I'm really rolling today.

[01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:12.120]
I have no idea why.

[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.480]
Well, it's because I'm so anxious to be getting out of here very soon.

[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:17.260]
12 minutes past noon at 5.60 W.M.

[01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:19.920]
announcing the 2003 Neil Deal blowout sale.

[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:21.680]
It's going on right now, as I speak,

[01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:23.800]
at Haled Potty Ag GMC.

[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:25.120]
Man, they are good folks down there.

[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:25.760]
They treat you right.

[01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:28.160]
They got the lowest prices in the world waiting for it

[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:29.320]
from Tom Laman and Joe Prieto.

[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:31.780]
Here's Neil Deal number one, Numero Uno.

[01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:38.620]
Get 0% financing for 60 months on every single 2003 Potty Ag or GMC in stock.

[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:40.340]
Neil Deal, Numero DOS.

[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:45.060]
Get up to a $4,000 rebate on every 2003 Potty Ag and GMC in stock.

[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:49.640]
And this continues to be an excellent thing for all you current and former military personnel.

[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:52.920]
You can get an additional $750 rebate from your friends at Haled,

[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:55.540]
just as they say in Europe as they are.

[01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:59.420]
Just for the halibut, as they say in the fish factory.

[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:04.540]
And you can also buy a Potty Ag 2003 Sunfire for only $11,998.

[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:07.540]
Or a full size year for just $15,998.

[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:09.620]
Hurry in right now because inventories are limited.

[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:14.940]
And you can still, this always amazes me because I mean, I guess they must be trusting folks down there, huh?

[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:17.760]
You can test drive any vehicle on a lot for 24 hours.

[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:20.920]
You can take it home, take it to work, take it up the old Hershey highway,

[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:22.740]
take it up the...

[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:24.000]
Unless you would say...

[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.820]
As Thurance would say, take it up the...

[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:29.820]
And of course Haled's also got a great selection of certified vehicle cars, trucks and SUVs.

[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:32.460]
That's right, if you work at QYM, there's an asterisk.

[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:33.360]
There's an exception here.

[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:35.640]
Speaking of taking up the old...

[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:36.680]
And if you have credit...

[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:42.400]
You should see who was at the door, who just opened the door, speaking of...

[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:42.780]
Correct them.

[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:48.840]
Anyway, and if your credit is pretty marginal, speaking of working at QYM, they'll still manage to go to the deal with Haled, plenty of XEMC.

[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:51.280]
That was good timing, my psychic powers once again.

[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:56.260]
134 or 131 South Dixie Highway, that's US-1 across from the falls open every day, seven days a week.

[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:01.380]
For more info call on the Neal Deal, hotline toll free, one purple date when you come down?

[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:02.880]
God, I gotta get out of here!

[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:05.620]
So I don't see you with this high-end act you're putting on.

[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:08.600]
That would've been so...

[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:09.320]
I know, amazing.

[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:14.240]
Called the Neal Deal hotline toll free at 1-885-34-42-11.

[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:18.140]
I'd like to finish this poppy 4-2, 1-885-34-42-11.

[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:22.660]
Of course, all Neal Deal, something to credit, provost your friends and now, at least they used to be our friends, 40-tails.

[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:26.020]
Haled Potty XEMC, they are professional grade.

[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:32.200]
Ride in local, here's sports video 560, you a-a-m.

[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:36.840]
And I have your attention, please.

[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:40.080]
And I have your attention, please.

[01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:43.900]
Will the real-grant-grady please stand up?

[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:48.540]
I repeat, will the real-grant-grady please stand up?

[01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:50.360]
We're gonna have a fun here.

[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:52.700]
You're lacking like you've never seen a white dwarf before.

[01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:56.280]
Who is on the same floor with a three-sister separated by a latham dwarf?

[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.060]
And a bathroom with tile floor and so born at the store.

[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:03.200]
Sleeping a bump in, sitting a bump in, and too much to be stung in the herd.

[01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.980]
Oh, great, you didn't just say that, the end-ware ain't enough.

[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:06.660]
Of course I did.

[01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:08.220]
You idiot, you're just a kid.

[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:11.420]
Little Peter the Rage can't hit the high note to the song I changed.

[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:12.860]
Great-grady, y'all sick of me.

[01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:15.560]
You all stupid new, would you rather have the poachage family?

[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.520]
Danny with his red hair, any cute?

[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.260]
Here's a little secret, the kid that plays guitar, it's new.

[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:22.860]
I also like to take keep-blood and assert my boo.

[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:26.760]
Sometimes I wanna jump, Marsha, and just go, but I can't, but she's my sis when I'm a girl.

[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.500]
So what, this family is sick, this family is sick.

[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:31.680]
No kidding, they are people with the slum, they admit.

[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.220]
My dad designs a house with three adults and six kids.

[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:36.380]
But only one bathroom for all of us to play.

[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:38.860]
And for Alice only has a bunch of room in which I live in.

[01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:41.060]
Right next to the kitchen, but I guess I'm only bitching,

[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:43.440]
because my dad was been an ancient little Cindy with a lip.

[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:45.080]
Making my eyes stop shaking and twinging.

[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:47.940]
Why can't you just stop saying Marsha, Marsha, Marsha, like a vixen?

[01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:50.160]
And Bobby gets to the dentist, so we think he could be fixed.

[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.960]
I'm about to fall for my heart and his Marsha knows.

[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:54.940]
I'm so mad, I'm let it go, I got the problem.

[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:58.740]
Starting great-grady is on the real radio, so the other breed is adjustable.

[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:01.680]
On to ladies, so what, the real great-grady please stand up.

[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:03.960]
Please stand up, please stand up.

[01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:06.260]
Yes, I'm great-grady, yes, I'm the real ready,

[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:07.820]
so the other breed is adjustable.

[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:10.840]
On to ladies, so what, the real great-grady please stand up.

[01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:13.180]
Please stand up, please stand up.

[01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:17.860]
Oh yeah, mom says he's no plain boy and they hit the house.

[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:20.100]
Marcha, you look fine.

[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:25.520]
From 18 at 560 to over to 2M375 votes on a poll generally speaking, which religious group

[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:27.500]
in the US has is the most fanatic.

[01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:32.740]
Born again Christians 267, 71.2% let's hear it for the born again.

[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:36.600]
Muslim is 38, Orthodox Jews 32.

[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:41.060]
To hope his witness is 28, Catholics only 7.

[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:46.500]
They've kind of calmed down since the Godfather came out and the Mormons only 4 out of 377.

[01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:48.960]
Mormons here very much in the background.

[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:50.880]
We keep them in their place.

[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:55.460]
Here's the facts, angry facts from Ray and Helen Dale and proud of it.

[01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:57.920]
If you were in Helen Dale, would you be proud of it?

[01:45:57.960 --> 01:45:58.840]
No, you'd be embarrassed.

[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:04.460]
It says the Neil Rogers show has degraded into one old man, be raiding and hassling another old man.

[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:06.640]
Maybe it's time for Neil to retire.

[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:10.160]
The material must be pretty scarce when all we hear are mo bits all day long.

[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:11.680]
Have we played one mo bit today?

[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:13.060]
That's what I recall.

[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:14.560]
No, maybe some drop-ins.

[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:15.760]
You know, with drop-ins?

[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:18.020]
Which evidently, Ray does no difference between a drop-in.

[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:19.320]
What do you think Ray's problem is?

[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:19.780]
He's stupid.

[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:20.800]
Plus, he's in Helen Dale.

[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:22.020]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:22.540]
He's stupid.

[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:23.660]
Okay, Mo, just calm down.

[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:25.640]
Get with it, Ray.

[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:29.320]
And by the way, Coxelhoist in Helen Dale and go find a radio show you might enjoy.

[01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:30.360]
Okay, because this ain't the one.

[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:32.200]
This ain't the one for people over the age of 100.

[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.920]
And give us Sunny Rosenberg a big kiss when you wake up tomorrow morning.

[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:38.540]
Here's the facts from Jay, who says,

[01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:41.180]
just got back into town. I'm glad you are back too.

[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:42.220]
Oh, not for long, Jay.

[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:43.840]
Take a quick look.

[01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:47.480]
So as I was listing and wondering, where is Bener Boyd?

[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.200]
Then you mentioned briefly while reading the letter that he was fired.

[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:51.720]
He was fired.

[01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:53.240]
Absolutely correct.

[01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:53.960]
What happened?

[01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:56.460]
Can you share or was it a private thing? Love you, says Jay.

[01:46:56.660 --> 01:47:00.920]
Well, I don't want to say it's a private thing because it's not so private since you already blurted it all over the air.

[01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:04.860]
But I don't want to like rehash the whole thing because that would be throwing them out of the bus.

[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:06.360]
Now, they did something to think about.

[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:08.980]
Because he's really not all that big.

[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.140]
It would be hard to throw them out of the bus.

[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:11.520]
We need to throw them. He'll wind up there.

[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:13.460]
Well, it would have busked like a flat tire or something.

[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:15.200]
It would have just been in front of it.

[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:18.000]
Oh, well, he had a difficulty. He had the issues.

[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:19.720]
And then a good way to put it. He had issues.

[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:24.620]
And he had a difficult time like staying in the upright position in his chair in the other room.

[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:25.800]
He had a difficult time.

[01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:28.260]
Or a time showing up on time or sometimes showing up at all.

[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:34.320]
He had problems, okay, without rehashing the whole thing.

[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.160]
And then he would be piling on.

[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:35.760]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:37.520]
I think the biggest problem is stupid.

[01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:37.820]
Right.

[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:40.900]
Any responsible all of these things.

[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:42.880]
So he's just small potatoes. He's gone.

[01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:46.040]
In addition to which, well, I don't want to, I don't want to, you know, embellish it.

[01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:48.780]
Now it's seriously because the thing we were saying off the air about the website,

[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.300]
Eric is doing just fine.

[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:53.700]
And most of the creative stuff on there comes in from our listeners anyway like,

[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:54.440]
what was the guy's name?

[01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:55.160]
Arnold Albert.

[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:56.360]
Arnold and Albert.

[01:47:56.860 --> 01:47:57.260]
And Jonesy.

[01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:59.860]
And Jonesy and all these guys, which we thank them again, they're great.

[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:01.720]
Let's see.

[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:04.600]
DA says, in the facts, hey, Neil, you're right.

[01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:07.080]
It sucks being one of those stuck here this time of the year.

[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:10.620]
Oh, I still can't vote or do stuff with this computer as I told you.

[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:11.960]
Oh, this is that guy again.

[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:13.360]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:14.920]
It's that Dennis guy.

[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:15.740]
Don't you remember from yesterday?

[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:17.240]
Why is everybody named Dennis?

[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:18.780]
So there should be some tech support, Dennis.

[01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:22.100]
Yeah, get some tech support and quit bugging us to fix your computer, okay?

[01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:23.180]
Get you some.

[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:25.140]
And then not only that, get some mental support too.

[01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:28.900]
See, when I got his first facts, I thought, oh, okay, well.

[01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:33.640]
And then when he called, ah, that opened up a whole new perspective for us.

[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:35.820]
People who want to make their problems, your price.

[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:37.580]
There's nothing I can do for you.

[01:48:37.820 --> 01:48:41.280]
And just like that guy said before about a bunch of free loaders, I think he had a good point,

[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:42.300]
now that I reflect on it.

[01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:46.860]
Go find a computer tech guy who can like straightening out and get you set up right.

[01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:47.360]
That's all.

[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:49.220]
Spend a couple of bucks.

[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:52.480]
If this show is that valuable to you, the price is right down close to your dime, listen.

[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:54.320]
So at least get set up right in the first place.

[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:58.260]
Dennis, don't be such a cheap ass like Kenny said or whatever the guy's name was.

[01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:02.460]
Now it says, I'm a subject of religious fanatics.

[01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:04.400]
Did you get a chance to see frailty yet?

[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:04.900]
Yes, I did.

[01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:10.120]
I think it'll be on cinemas this week or you can buy, ah, can get it at circuit city or best buy.

[01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:11.300]
I already seen it in Toronto.

[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:13.080]
Got the video up there at the DVD.

[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:15.100]
It was, ah, okay.

[01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:15.580]
Mm-hmm.

[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:19.520]
When you made it to Macy with the glasses that made him look Jewish.

[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:22.280]
What are you looking like that?

[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:24.360]
You don't even remember what movie this is.

[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:25.620]
Remember frailty.

[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:27.140]
With Matthew McConaughey?

[01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:28.180]
Are we thinking of the same movie?

[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:28.360]
No.

[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:29.780]
Maybe that's not the right movie then.

[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:31.420]
What is frailty?

[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:32.060]
What is that about?

[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:34.780]
Frailty had Matthew McConaughey and Bill Hax.

[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:36.680]
Quit just saying the same name over and over again.

[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:37.340]
What was it about?

[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:42.280]
It was about two brothers whose father was a religious fanatic killer.

[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:43.580]
He killed people with a pipe.

[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:12.940]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:42.780]
No, it was kind of lame. Now he's very good when it makes me good but I'll say it again. He was much better in Magnolia and I don't care what anybody says, including you or anybody else, Magnolia is a motion picture that is so brilliantly made. The acting is so spectacular. I can't even fire words to describe it. This is not for debate with me. OK? Just tell me my opinion. OK? That's like arguing with me about like Nestle's Turtle ice cream. If you don't like it, great. OK? Eat all the vanilla bean speck you want, OK?

[01:50:42.780 --> 01:50:44.260]
I'm just on you don't plan to argue

[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:47.140]
Magnolia's spectacular okay

[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:49.200]
Tom Cruise sir

[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:53.100]
What's his name that died Jason robots Jason robots

[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:57.440]
You know somebody in and keep Julian more. That's a conspiracy. Oh

[01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:03.360]
phenomenal William H. Macy they got to play the cop. What is his name? Oh?

[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:07.400]
I don't know he's in everything. No, you know his name. I know what his name is and I can't think of it boy

[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:12.660]
The old man is slipping and the other guy to play the the the the TV host right?

[01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:15.000]
Don't know who he is either he reminds me how are David though?

[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:19.940]
He did remind me a little of how are David it? Okay, so now you need to and then when that frog came down

[01:51:21.540 --> 01:51:27.840]
With William H. Macy fargo somebody I people have said fargo's not all that great. It's like low key, but it's good

[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:29.800]
Does that make any sense?

[01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:35.880]
Like all the scene in the bar with William H. Macy and I realized it's a fact thing

[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:38.260]
But nevertheless the scene in the bar with him

[01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:43.660]
And the guy from laughing which I can never think of his name anymore already Johnson not already John

[01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:47.460]
No, you know what I'm talking about that thing is so incredible

[01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:50.860]
That's hysterical and he looks at the bartender that he's got the hots for and he's like

[01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:57.420]
He sees the bartender got braces on which it was kind of silly and then he's like he runs his hand over his teeth

[01:51:57.420 --> 01:51:59.340]
And he's thinking to himself, you know

[01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:04.880]
Which now of course he's really motivated to give himself the braces because if he just he can brace himself for a real

[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:07.980]
Squirt score exciting experience, you know as in right-em cowboy

[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:15.760]
But it just didn't work out by the end of that movie he needed more than braces. He needs a lot of dinner to work

[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:18.300]
He needed he needed a lot of bridge work

[01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:25.700]

[01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:38.940]

[01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:44.020]
Gildy walking around a hall and for all and where it's like party time all the time now

[01:56:09.930 --> 01:56:10.990]
Superior Court

[01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:16.050]
Prosecutor Tom Taylor said he was surprised that it was announced in court that Cory Dean Moses

[01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:21.590]
Would testify in his own defense. How do you like that? They got Moses on the stand

[01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:25.910]
Moses of the it's got an address in Charlotte

[01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:31.670]
It charged with one kind of rape two counts of statutes to risk sex offense for counts of taking indecent liberties with minors

[01:56:31.670 --> 01:56:32.730]
His trial began on Tuesday

[01:56:33.310 --> 01:56:36.470]

[01:56:37.450 --> 01:56:40.630]

Damn straight on Queens Court in Gastonia after he was charged

[01:56:56.410 --> 01:57:02.570]
The alleged incidents took place at the church and other locations between October 2000 and 2002 the girls were younger than

[01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:04.470]
16 at the time of the incidents

[01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.830]
oh

[01:57:06.270 --> 01:57:11.890]
Sergeant a s-money with the Gaston County police testified yesterday that Moses told her in December 2002

[01:57:11.890 --> 01:57:16.870]
He might have rubbed his genitals against one of the girls several times in the church, but he never had sex with her

[01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:22.070]
He was just wiping them off

[01:57:23.710 --> 01:57:29.390]
Huh? I love I got to read that again. He said he might have rubbed his genitals against one of the girls several times at the church

[01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:30.590]
He never had sex with her

[01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:37.410]
She said Moses also told her that while teaching the other girl how to drive his infinity she sat partially on his lap

[01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:42.610]
She added that Moses said he touched the girl with his genitals in the car in his house another time

[01:57:42.610 --> 01:57:47.390]
But denied ever having sex with her he just touched her lightly with his genitals. He just like you know

[01:57:52.090 --> 01:57:58.850]
By the way, I got a question for this audience is there any black male in America who is not now or at least in some time in his life

[01:57:58.850 --> 01:58:00.850]
Never been a minister pastor something

[01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:01.910]
Right

[01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:04.170]
Right, I don't think so

[01:58:05.090 --> 01:58:08.590]
Seriously, how many black men in America have never been some a man of the cloth

[01:58:09.070 --> 01:58:10.670]
And they're all in the NBA

[01:58:11.330 --> 01:58:16.950]
Is there a nail order place you can get your whatever it is that they get to be a minister a reverend? Yeah

[01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:24.790]
Oh, that's right. We had it on this site. Of course there always has been anybody can be a reverend like Jesse Jackson for example

[01:58:25.370 --> 01:58:30.150]
The Reverend Moses Calhoun, you know, everybody is a reverend a minister

[01:58:31.110 --> 01:58:36.990]
Isn't the same thing through a Haitian community very much. Let's go get fracked or how about getting defraught

[01:58:40.250 --> 01:58:45.770]
408 votes on a poll generally speaking which religious group in the US is the most fanatic we ask today

[01:58:54.290 --> 01:59:00.670]
concerned about your attitudes and behavior and the ambiance and the smell of the aroma of your deal

They can buy it like in public right. I don't know who makes those maybe the moonies. No, no, no

[01:59:34.710 --> 01:59:39.310]

[01:59:39.310 --> 01:59:42.870]
It's meat free they have like bacon which by the way bacon's bad for your ass

[02:00:58.790 --> 02:01:00.890]
I was gonna say we're playing they're playing with an empty deck

[02:01:01.890 --> 02:01:03.810]
And it's still the dog days, okay?

[02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:10.750]
Well, we have a sufficient number of people plus we got all these other people on the station do two hour shows hour and a half

[02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:14.390]
No show like the Humphrey's off again today because of the dolphin game

[02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:20.870]
So why don't I mean what the hell did we ever do they have to do four solid hours to try to do a tap dance to the public every day all the time?

[02:01:20.930 --> 02:01:25.490]
Right, let's protest. Let's call it a protest and then we are doing a protest. No, I mean that's not good a sit-in

[02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:29.030]
No, because that would that would that's not good. We're still entertaining sure

[02:01:29.470 --> 02:01:32.850]
Well, we're gonna protest that way it's not like I'm just throwing a bunch of crap on area

[02:01:32.850 --> 02:01:36.170]
Try to pick some good stuff. That's amusing that we don't play every god damn day

[02:01:37.110 --> 02:01:37.830]
For example

Is that a great tagging back on me now?

[02:01:39.590 --> 02:01:41.010]
Like that. That's pretty amusing to me

[02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:45.670]

He's a good guy. He used to call the show a couple of times. Oh, he loves this show. He's a good guy

[02:02:05.290 --> 02:02:09.150]
I feel bad for Soaper and Gary because you know everybody needs to eat

[02:02:10.090 --> 02:02:13.050]
Everybody needs a job, but they got to be in burst in humility

[02:02:13.050 --> 02:02:16.090]
They're there with a silly ass Brian norcross and angel array

[02:02:16.090 --> 02:02:21.130]

Who gives all kinds of editorial opinions on the year about alien and this and that

[02:02:27.190 --> 02:02:30.530]
Well, I wouldn't have the neighborhood put him on the staff to do editorials on the year, you know

[02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:34.110]
He's an idiot. Oh, and you know who else we can't stand over there

All right russia of bacon into 16 pounds portion of bacon

[02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:10.010]
Sounds like a pound to me

[02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:14.070]
Pardon me sounds like a pound to me. I finish which is a pound's life

[02:07:14.490 --> 02:07:17.510]

Go ahead. I won't go ahead. Okay. Bye-bye. Okay

[02:07:24.990 --> 02:07:28.970]
I all I did was say it sounds like a pounder right where he gets on a velocity

[02:07:28.970 --> 02:07:32.550]
You know see this right here him and that old fart that faxed me from hell and no

[02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:36.570]
This is one of the use so many reasons why this is such an unpleasant place

[02:07:36.570 --> 02:07:40.890]
I mean granted the weather we can't control. It's too hot. It's too humid. It drains too much

[02:07:40.890 --> 02:07:42.330]
It's like today is a good example

[02:07:42.330 --> 02:07:48.530]
But even assuming that these things didn't exist there are just too many of the wrong people here

[02:07:48.530 --> 02:07:52.370]
I'm arrest no ever arguing with me about that. It's hot up for debate. It's the truth

[02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:56.410]
I mean I go to Toronto the people I mean people. I don't even know they're pleasant

[02:07:56.410 --> 02:07:59.690]
They're friendly. They open the door for it. They say hello. They hold the elevator

[02:07:59.690 --> 02:08:03.570]
They're just they're not angry. They're not like all uptight. They're not hostile

[02:08:03.570 --> 02:08:07.870]
They don't they don't hate you just for being alive, you know not here

[02:08:09.190 --> 02:08:11.250]
No, I mean I was that was wrong to listen to the guy

[02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:16.850]
And remember and right now I thought it was me. I understand that I know that

[02:08:16.850 --> 02:08:21.990]
So I'm playing along with him a little bit. Okay, and all I did was say 16 ounces sounds like a pound

[02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:26.670]
I mean and right away he starts getting parked off about that parked off as in bacon

[02:08:28.070 --> 02:08:31.790]
For him boy. This guy's making rash your judgments that I usually make

[02:08:33.970 --> 02:08:39.550]
Well, what is this thing here about the hotel wants Tauwauthe's nah, I don't want that for him

[02:08:41.470 --> 02:08:47.450]
What Tauwauthe's it's not interesting. All those words you seem to his call about oh and look at line 9 is ring

[02:08:47.450 --> 02:08:52.030]
Now you know it's gonna be a short call WQA M chronic line. Oh, huh see there he is

[02:09:15.330 --> 02:09:17.470]
Well, what do you mean don't use your name on the year Andre?

[02:09:18.270 --> 02:09:22.770]
I say Dr. Neil. Well, we know you didn't say your last name. Don't say it because you are on the year

[02:09:22.770 --> 02:09:26.210]
But well, why would you say this is Andre? Do we ever ask anybody their name?

[02:09:27.630 --> 02:09:34.190]
I actually wanted to change the subject a little bit. I would say don't use my name on the air. Are you like is there a search about the

[02:09:34.190 --> 02:09:39.010]
I have a lot of friends. Are you like a terrorist? No, no, no, no. Your picture with a poster office?

[02:09:39.510 --> 02:09:43.030]
Not yet. You have like a naked website that we could check out

[02:09:43.470 --> 02:09:47.690]
Um, maybe are you like the four of diamonds and the deck of clubs cards

[02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:50.590]
Go ahead, go ahead. I'll judge

[02:09:51.310 --> 02:09:59.030]
That's what I'm having. We'll come up with that. Well, I was so excited yesterday that you somebody finally or you did finally make a fold it

[02:09:59.030 --> 02:10:01.090]
I like oh man. I'm surprised

[02:10:01.090 --> 02:10:06.610]
This is the one reason the dolphins are not gonna go to Super Bowl. Is that a jet band is announcing?

[02:10:07.010 --> 02:10:08.830]
That's pretty good. I'm gonna go to playoff this year

[02:10:08.830 --> 02:10:12.670]
It changed him. They get them for back and what what happened is him for?

[02:10:13.630 --> 02:10:17.550]
Uh, he was doing the um FIU games, I believe. What? Me?

[02:10:19.470 --> 02:10:19.990]
He was

[02:10:19.990 --> 02:10:24.130]
I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, I think he was for FIU, which is ridiculous for guy of his caliber

[02:10:24.130 --> 02:10:27.650]
He wanted to do the hurricane games and a hurricane said oh no

[02:10:27.650 --> 02:10:30.850]
Well, we want Joseph Gackey to do all of our sports and we want one guy

[02:10:30.850 --> 02:10:34.890]
Which of course, I mean, Joseph and I sky but to compare him to Bill Zinfra is so ludicrous

[02:10:34.890 --> 02:10:37.370]
Joe is so bush league on those ball games, you know

[02:10:37.370 --> 02:10:40.610]
And so Zinfra got screwed over basically because this guy came here

[02:10:40.610 --> 02:10:43.830]
Zinfra wound up getting the shaft and mad dog has never recovered from it

[02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:44.450]
Oh my

[02:10:44.450 --> 02:10:45.590]
Oh my

[02:10:46.230 --> 02:10:49.630]
Well, we got to do everything in our power to get him off

[02:10:51.130 --> 02:10:52.130]
In closing

[02:10:53.050 --> 02:10:55.590]
That's the hardest 12 inches in football. Okay, Ted

[02:10:57.050 --> 02:11:00.410]
FIU, well don't call him uh, whatever his name was

[02:11:01.630 --> 02:11:08.050]
Pete Andre five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line

[02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.530]

It's it's you know same stuff. Don't you think

[02:12:16.610 --> 02:12:23.190]
How much longer can we wait for Sheridan to spring that thing and I realized Luis is slower than the damn a bunch of molasses

[02:12:23.190 --> 02:12:28.390]
But how long before he realizes that that ten pound bag of sugar is down about three ounces now, huh?

[02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:33.030]
Unbelievable. I can't stand it much longer. Don't you love the way don't you love the way that Edna

[02:12:33.650 --> 02:12:37.970]
When Hank came over to inspect the house that she grabbed a hold of his arm to mmm boy was strong

[02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:44.310]
She's the horniest old koot that ever came down to fight. He's the greatest man. Oh, yeah, she's the she's the whole show

[02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:48.470]
I think so I think she's this is Wallace man. She's the whole show. She's the best

[02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:52.010]

But he's supposed to be that's his that's his role, you know, okay, buddy. I'm so sorry buddy. You know, that's his whole thing

[02:13:08.170 --> 02:13:14.370]

[02:13:56.310 --> 02:14:01.950]
She's got a big rack. I mean she's just she's beautiful. She's hot. Just not hot enough for me to want to watch a soap opera

[02:14:02.810 --> 02:14:07.730]
It's not a soap opera. It's a comedy show. It's a comedy show. It's not a soap opera

[02:14:08.350 --> 02:14:10.410]
It's given it a bad time for me. Okay

[02:14:10.950 --> 02:14:12.470]
Well, why don't you just say that?

[02:14:12.830 --> 02:14:18.810]
I have before I'm gonna try to like do this macho thing. Well, oh look at this suit alleged is episcopal dices ignore an abuse

[02:14:18.810 --> 02:14:22.350]
This just these isolated incidents just keep pouring in here

[02:14:22.350 --> 02:14:22.490]
Ha

[02:14:23.650 --> 02:14:28.850]
Too many of suit the episcopal icies of North Carolina Northern California allegedly were sexually abused by a

[02:14:28.850 --> 02:14:33.530]
Marisville priest in the 1970s and that the church failed to be spawned when the abuse was reported

[02:14:34.390 --> 02:14:39.550]
In their lawsuit James sharp and Robert Given say they were abused by the Reverend Donald J West

[02:14:39.550 --> 02:14:43.630]
While they were teenage parishioners that changed John's episcopal church in Marisville

[02:14:43.630 --> 02:14:47.850]
They are seeking unspecified damages in the suit file this week in Sacramento Superior Court

[02:14:47.850 --> 02:14:52.490]
Sharp who lives in Uba city says he was 15 years old when the sex abuse began about 1972

[02:14:52.490 --> 02:14:57.250]
Givens a Minnesota resident said he was 17 when abused in 78 the two didn't know each other then

[02:14:57.870 --> 02:15:04.230]
In 1978 according to the suit suits Paris brought them out at a bishop john Thompson who did not report the allegations to police

[02:15:04.230 --> 02:15:10.570]
West was passed to a manual episcopal church in grass valley in 83 and saying andrews a episcopal church in cornhole

[02:15:10.570 --> 02:15:12.210]
according in 1989

[02:15:13.250 --> 02:15:18.870]
In 1995 the Northern California dices now under bishop Jerry a lamb he's on the lamb held a tribe unit

[02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:24.910]
And West was removed from the priesthood in February 1996 according to very bias knew the bishops assistant West died in

[02:15:24.910 --> 02:15:25.550]
1996

[02:15:26.110 --> 02:15:30.450]
Bias knew said that I see now has a zero tolerance policy towards sex abuse by its priest

[02:15:30.450 --> 02:15:33.470]
Well, that's good. That's your benefit of the capital church is well

[02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:38.990]
We're gonna try to clamp down, but you do get a couple of freebies three you get three free passes if you get caught

[02:15:38.990 --> 02:15:44.910]
Oh three catches that that thing that I read before people ought to be foaming at the mouth about the because that's a local story

[02:15:45.710 --> 02:15:49.870]
About the two priests with these stature limitations and the local archdiocese is well

[02:15:49.870 --> 02:15:52.150]
We don't care about the civil case because you know

[02:15:52.670 --> 02:15:58.650]
What do you know? You're in other words on a technicality will reinstate them and just don't bother us

[02:15:58.650 --> 02:16:02.750]
No moe. We'll just remember before the meeting even if the law said this they were above it

[02:16:03.410 --> 02:16:04.270]
That was the whole attitude

[02:16:05.370 --> 02:16:05.810]
Exactly

[02:16:47.870 --> 02:16:52.530]
I just love his magic

[02:16:52.530 --> 02:16:58.730]
When we're on tour I just hope

[02:17:00.650 --> 02:17:03.850]

You can shake it and spray it all over

[02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:29.350]
Remember you can't beat a red cock

[02:21:31.050 --> 02:21:34.110]

Every union's it's hard to choose who's got the nicest two

[02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:13.390]
And I don't like the way my daddy has been watching me

[02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:25.850]
There is a child living down in Mexico

[02:24:27.310 --> 02:24:30.990]
Who has to go to work every day

[02:24:33.790 --> 02:24:39.050]
Sit at his desk making clothes for Kathy Lee

[02:24:39.610 --> 02:24:43.770]
Loves the work but doesn't love the pain

[02:24:44.850 --> 02:24:50.010]
They are the kids who make the clothing

[02:24:51.230 --> 02:24:56.030]
They are the ones who make a bucket day so quick and plain

[02:24:57.910 --> 02:25:00.170]
It's just clothes to make it

[02:25:01.910 --> 02:25:03.990]

They'll wash your car

[02:25:37.790 --> 02:25:38.630]
In your house

[02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:39.610]
In your car

[02:25:39.610 --> 02:25:40.870]
Anything you want

[02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:43.210]
Because if they don't you'll have them deported

[02:25:43.210 --> 02:25:45.190]
Audio some vehicles

[02:25:45.190 --> 02:25:47.170]
Be the Ted color when you hear this sound

[02:25:48.050 --> 02:25:49.270]
And win a Mexican

[02:25:49.270 --> 02:25:52.730]
Members of this station and their families are not eligible to own Mexicans

[02:25:52.730 --> 02:25:55.650]
Fading in de-Lasiga Mexicans is winner's responsibility

[02:25:55.650 --> 02:25:59.650]
Station assumes no liability for infectious diseases carried by Mexicans

[02:25:59.650 --> 02:26:01.890]

With your own very own Mexican

[02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:06.190]
People just think of me

[02:26:06.190 --> 02:26:08.070]
Oh look at this you know that shooting they had that

[02:26:08.070 --> 02:26:09.990]
Not Casey Shacotry yesterday that shot up seven

[02:26:09.990 --> 02:26:11.130]
And the disgruntled worker

[02:26:11.130 --> 02:26:13.190]
CNN wants to know where did he get the gun

[02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:14.590]

400 and that's an idea

[02:26:20.830 --> 02:26:22.350]
I think we can make her killing

[02:26:22.350 --> 02:26:24.730]
So to speak guns and booze vending machines

[02:26:24.730 --> 02:26:25.350]
All right

[02:26:26.290 --> 02:26:28.090]
490 votes on the polls generally speaking

[02:26:28.090 --> 02:26:31.210]
Which religious group in the US is the most fanatic

[02:26:31.930 --> 02:26:34.250]
Born again Christians 342

Orthodox Jews 40

[02:26:38.970 --> 02:26:39.570]

Catholics 10 and Mormons only six

[02:26:41.710 --> 02:26:42.490]
Don't forget uh

[02:26:42.490 --> 02:26:43.150]
Joanne Mark

[02:26:43.850 --> 02:26:45.910]
At singular round us three to five this afternoon

[02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:48.390]
That's on 20335 Biscayne Boulevard

[02:26:48.390 --> 02:26:49.870]
Biscayne and 203rd

[02:26:50.650 --> 02:26:51.410]
In adventura

[02:26:51.410 --> 02:26:52.730]
They'll have all the best in the old stuff

[02:26:52.730 --> 02:26:53.990]
Including uh a sub

[02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:55.450]
Back uh supply

[02:26:55.450 --> 02:26:57.250]
Of some of those 2001

[02:26:57.250 --> 02:27:00.170]
Biscayne will see these and the mad dog Jim Manage

[02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:02.470]
He chains

[02:27:04.050 --> 02:27:06.950]
Hey if you're a trying desperately to lose weight like most Americans

[02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:09.430]
Got it we're just getting a fatter and fatter

[02:27:09.430 --> 02:27:10.710]
You know portion size

[02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:14.330]
They were showing I saw a piece on about um

[02:27:14.330 --> 02:27:15.610]
They said piece on this

[02:27:15.610 --> 02:27:18.910]
Now I saw a piece about this whole thing about the portions in like europe

[02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:22.290]
As opposed to here and everything here has to be like pooper size

[02:27:22.290 --> 02:27:24.550]
Uh heaping helping uh heaping uh heap of crap

[02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:26.930]
So if you're a big fat heap and you'd like to lose the weight

[02:27:26.930 --> 02:27:28.150]
Here's an easy way to do it

[02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:29.830]
And it's a delicious way to do it too

[02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:31.950]
Because unlike most of the weight loss programs

[02:27:31.950 --> 02:27:33.990]
They don't give you like pigeon size portions of food

[02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:35.950]
They give you like a big healthy sack

[02:27:36.750 --> 02:27:38.750]
And there's nothing like having a big healthy sack

[02:27:38.750 --> 02:27:41.030]
Every day it's right there at your door by six and a.m.

[02:27:41.070 --> 02:27:42.150]
Your little black sack

[02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:43.130]
Three gourmet meals

[02:27:43.130 --> 02:27:44.330]
Two delicious snacks

[02:27:44.330 --> 02:27:45.850]
They're right in there at your home

[02:27:45.850 --> 02:27:47.450]
At your work wherever you're going to be

[02:27:47.830 --> 02:27:49.270]
Can't make it much more simple than that

[02:27:49.270 --> 02:27:50.930]
The only figure out you have to do

[02:27:50.930 --> 02:27:52.570]
Is make up the menu once a week

[02:27:52.570 --> 02:27:54.450]
There are two choices for every meal on the program

[02:27:54.450 --> 02:27:55.130]
And that's it

That's the total attendance at the Marley's

[02:30:15.030 --> 02:30:16.670]
A flat day

[02:30:17.470 --> 02:30:18.670]

Religious groups, mythed at the release of the film theatrically, became outraged on the event of its home distribution

[02:31:52.750 --> 02:31:55.170]

In fact, maybe I'll take another peak.

[02:57:38.290 --> 02:57:40.510]
So anyway, Channel 23, we'll find out the name of that show.
