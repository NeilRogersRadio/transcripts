[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920]
Anyway, Neil, your good friend Reverend John said hi to me last night. Where is he?

[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.360]
Kenny and Reverend John's were looking for you last night and despite what?

[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.580]
That's what I was doing. I couldn't talk to you because I was gonna read a blow a big one.

[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.360]
Now who's laughing now though? I filled my section. You said I couldn't do it.

[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.140]
What are you talking about? Fill your section.

[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.760]
I had, I was like, that's like saying I'm filling this studio with the listener, you know?

[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.500]
I had the desire, Stadia, there must have been fun. Why don't you admit it right now?

[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.800]
I don't want to bring you out of the closet. Why don't you admit it that you were lying through your teeth?

[00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.720]
You try to tell these people. Yeah, I got to come to ballpark. You don't care about the ballpark,

[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.120]
which is fine. You know there's no baseball fans here. You're turning into a orgy central.

[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.940]
It's just good when I was even little beaterboy got laid there last night. He thinks when I was eating my

[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.840]
friends to a meal said to me, he said, I'll admit it that Miami fans are clearly at a different level

[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.760]
than all other cities. Just make no mistake about that. That's right.

[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.220]
They're in a leak of their own. Yeah, they're good. I'm going to tell you the audience,

[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.740]
if you could come in here, you want to really draw a crowd. What we're going to do is have you

[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.420]
eat at the stadium? Yeah. If this audience could see you eat, man, it's an experience like so,

[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.100]
which I've never seen. I've seen it. I've seen it. I've been there for a phase. I've seen every fat pig

[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.560]
that make me look like Minnie Mouse. I mean, but I have never seen anybody just, he's, I was

[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.380]
shaying show, shaying, showing it done. George gets so nervous. I bet that's anything with an

[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.420]
essay to use utensils at all. Why use utensils at all? Yeah, you can use your fingers. I don't even

[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.580]
use an accent. That's what the beast said when he and Claret were in a hallway there this morning.

[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.640]
Why use utensils when you use your fingers? Yeah, I go out to the water bottle in the, in the bullpen in

[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.100]
here when I've done it. I just splash my hands off and I go in soaking water. Man has taken the

[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.260]
maple syrup and he's pouring it out. He's got the French toast in the air. He's got the halfway

[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.600]
to his push and he's pouring the molasses on it. And he's getting ready to put it in the water.

[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.000]
What's the difference between me doing that and sitting in here with all the hanks tack on this

[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.480]
mic and they got, Howard's got some like ginger vitus land on the end of it. I got, I mean,

[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.500]
man, it's just how it's a little bit. A little runoff from his bag. I can get her bees touching

[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.100]
this mic. I mean, the food I eat in there with my fingers, that's, you know, that's why chicks

[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:22.160]
dig me. I mean, you can see I have the manners. Oh, good. Last night I had the parking lots filled

[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.580]
40,000 fans there. Worse than me. Every single person that came up and said, how did they go,

[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.740]
hey, Farah, I just wanted to say to you, no, Neil, not one person cared to meet me. They all

[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.100]
asked about you. You have to suck my ass. You have to suck the Jones. You know what is tongue

[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.700]
in deep inside your dome, don't you got a suck. And John says he wanted to suck your ass.

[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.320]
For like four hours. Tell him to suck this. I know he really said he wanted to spend four hours

[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.380]
in your rectum. You know, I'm excited about it. I think he said he wanted to spend the rest of his

[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.220]
life in Uranus is what he was saying. Well, my next event is out of this world, Reverend John.

[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.780]
My next baseball event is I got two of them John Smoltz's Jesus Knight and then the one immediately

[00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.360]
thereafter is it's your anus knight. All right. We're going to have a big, he had a lot of assholes

[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.680]
after that game. I think I can get more if I can get your million and a half, two million

[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.300]
lasers. We get a meal's rectum. In fact, in fact, if you get like 20,000 people after that, you

[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.260]
have like twice Howard's audience. I had to be there. Returned away people last night at the game.

[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.360]
Oh, now what is he laughing about in the back? You backstabber. I heard that you backstabbing

[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.880]
pony to BST. Oh, brother, you should see the way you used to suck most ass man. The fans

[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.520]
in the last few years. As soon as Mo kicked his ass off the show and I was busy sucking your ass.

[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.180]
The fans were chanting BST last night as he was busting off the chicken with his hell of a job.

[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.140]
You know, it's great about the beast man. He does runs up there. He gets carvel.

[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.100]
That was a lot cheaper than a high colonic. You know, the key was is that I had all the

[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.000]
fans there. And a lot of fans there. A lot of fans there. Neil 40,000 people.

[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.040]
You know, the nervous laugh. By the way, have you seen the beast in Claret's on our website?

[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.820]
I just know that Clarence came home from Omaha and no one respects him anymore. They just

[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.860]
think he's a whore. That'll shut this show down. Have a lot of a see day.

[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.740]
Okay, you asshole.

[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.500]
You asshole.

[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.140]
Baby McCartney.

[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.460]
New ones on the way.

[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.560]
Haven't been a daddy since he has today.

[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.320]
Heather is expecting. We can work it out.

[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.300]
But it doesn't make me want to twist and shout.

[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.440]
At home when I'm 64 I still change diapers.

[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.700]
When this kid's grown up I will be dead.

[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.340]
Better stock up now on baby wipers.

[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.120]
My aching head.

[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.840]
Baby McCartney won't give me no rest.

[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.160]
I am not much better off than he best.

[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.900]
Don't know if the kid will be a singer.

[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.200]
Just hope it's healthy when it finally comes.

[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.260]
You're gay.

[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.820]
Want the job to have ten toes in finger.

[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.960]
Unlike it's mom.

[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.220]
Baby McCartney, your dad is elderly.

[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.720]
Wonder why I couldn't just let me.

[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.180]
This is better.

[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.600]
I believe you.

[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.740]
Ten oh six at five sixty WQM.

[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.780]
So the beast is crawling around all fours on the floor.

[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.080]
Another clearance is back in the building.

[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.900]
Can you I can I can actually envision that I can see it.

[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.660]
I don't want to and we got that gigantic jug.

[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.700]
I can see it right from where I'm sitting.

[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.620]
I get a jug of olioleva extra virgin extra virgin olive oil for the beasts.

[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.300]
There you go, clearance.

[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.100]
Get it while it's hot.

[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.340]
You know, I don't I don't think I'm going to make it through the rest of this week.

[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.220]
This has been too much for a old man like me.

[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.280]
This has been way too much.

[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.980]
I can't deal with just watching him eat.

[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.820]
Have you ever seen anything like that?

[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.520]
It's a show.

[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.920]
I mean, it's bizarre.

[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.340]
He brings fingers into play.

[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.320]
He's a doggy cat.

[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.000]
This gives new meaning to finger food.

[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.200]
Rucker Howard would love him a lot.

[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.780]
He's like just shoveling it down.

[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.940]
It comes in during his breaks.

[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.300]
And this is what they for you know, clearance.

[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.360]
You're a real jackass.

[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.720]
Okay.

[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.860]
Here's the guy they finally bring a guy in who's like a talent.

[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.620]
They bring somebody in that we actually like.

[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.760]
That's a lot of fun.

[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.740]
That uh, you know, it's having a good time and well,

[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.700]
you're not going to be able to eat in that studio.

[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.320]
We're going to show you a thing or two.

[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.240]
This is clearance's idea of trying to be a macho man.

[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.880]
You know, he's trying to like butcher himself up.

[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.260]
He's going to show these guys.

[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.620]
Of course, you notice that he made an exception for this room.

[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.900]
We did not get that memo.

[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.360]
Did we?

[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.280]
No, no, we did not.

[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.800]
Will we ever get that memo?

[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.360]
No, because he could blow it out his ass.

[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.400]
And he knows that we'd eat it in the studio.

[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.840]
We'd probably put ketchup in my e-d it with relish.

[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.360]
Not that we don't like your clearance.

[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.540]
You're a good little punk, but you know, keep your place.

[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.020]
Sit in your, your Mahogany desk.

[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.320]
Oh, that's right.

[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.020]
They got Mahogany cards and Mahogany desk.

[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.100]
I still can't get over that.

[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.980]
Had a tremendous response on it yesterday.

[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.380]
The thing about them, Mahogany cards.

[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.320]
WQA, I'm line nine.

[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.140]
It's got to be a crank.

[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.480]
Hello.

[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.080]
QIM.

[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.000]
Hi.

[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.640]
Is this Neil?

[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.640]
Sounds like Neil.

[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.860]
Let me.

[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.400]
Hi, Neil.

[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.460]
This is Andy Arthasda.

[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.400]
I'm the guy that's not going to forget about a board game.

[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.300]
Forget about a board game?

[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.540]
Right.

[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:27.920]
I sent it to the Florida studio, though.

[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.260]
Are you starting?

[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.740]
Are you in Florida?

[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.940]
How are you still in Toronto?

[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.000]
I'm in Florida right now.

[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.940]
Yeah, it's in the studio.

[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.500]
Somebody must have lifted it.

[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.200]
It's in a box here.

[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.240]
Oh, it's in the box.

[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:36.940]
We didn't open it.

[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.440]
It's a mafia theme's monopoly game.

[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:39.900]
You'll get a key.

[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.120]
Really?

[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:40.560]
Okay.

[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.840]
Well, it's probably around somewhere.

[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.340]
And I gave it and there's a couple other products that come along.

[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.580]
I just I know you're going to kick out of it.

[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.920]
Would you like the mafia lore stuff?

[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.580]
I sure do.

[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.220]
All right.

[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:48.980]
I'll look for it.

[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.300]
Thanks, Andy.

[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:49.600]
Thank you.

[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.320]
Have a great day.

[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:50.440]
Bye.

[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.380]
There you go.

[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.040]
There's our first caller.

[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.500]
God, it's given us something for free.

[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.120]
He wasn't a real exciting guy,

[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.160]
but nevertheless we'll take it.

[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.220]
Whatever it is, we'll take it.

[00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.500]
Except more pictures from that asshole of Monkey Man.

[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.340]
Leave us alone.

[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.740]
Okay, I realized that BoBina boys encouraging you,

[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.480]
but leave me alone.

[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.060]
Stay away from our lives.

[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:07.560]
Okay?

[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:08.840]
Monkey Man.

[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.180]
You're encouraging him.

[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:11.800]
Oh, look at this.

[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.240]
These are cute little pictures of the monkeys.

[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:13.920]
There you go.

[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.740]
You're in, you see, he with one hand is pushing him away.

[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.560]
And the other hand is like squeezing it.

[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.180]
Just keep him out of my life, the freaking monkey man.

[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.380]
Yeah, it's never season to amaze me.

[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.140]
We go from one misfit and like we finally work

[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.080]
feverishly for 15 years and we maybe get rid of one.

[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.600]
You know, were my right?

[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.040]
You think you maybe, maybe.

[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.620]
At least temporarily they go on hiatus or something.

[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.180]
And no, no sooner do they disappear than like all of a sudden.

[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.620]
There's another one just pops out of nowhere.

[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:41.720]
Like a hydrant.

[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.820]
To take their place.

[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.820]
So, Ferrell tells me that some of our misfits were there.

[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.960]
It is at the ballgame last night,

[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.920]
which comes as no surprise to me.

[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.060]
Gee, sorry, I missed that.

[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.500]
Guy with the eyes was there.

[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.420]
Your good buddy, Ken.

[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:54.840]
Woo.

[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:55.680]
Ken.

[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.480]
I think he'd have a good time with Eric up in Orlando.

[00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.240]
Let's send him up.

[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.160]
And then of course, the guy with the Fanny Pack did Miguel say that too.

[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:03.720]
I'll fanny pack it.

[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.320]
He was there too.

[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.600]
Oh, brother, what a just annoying guy.

[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.560]
Just really annoying.

[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.880]
Not on the same category with like all the eyes.

[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.760]
Being annoying all things.

[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.360]
Yeah, but nevertheless annoying.

[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.480]
Well, benign to you, but he was once a...

[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.260]
Well, he was once in the lobby at the Goddamn P.P.

[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.100]
Stadium there.

[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.440]
The Panther game with a gun.

[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.740]
The Herodom is a security guard.

[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.360]
He was carrying, he was packing heat in the Goddamn arena.

[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:27.500]
Yeah.

[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.160]
Good God.

[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.100]
Yes.

[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:30.820]
Right.

[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.860]
The guy with a Fanny Pack.

[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:33.940]
Well, it's not loaded.

[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:34.960]
What, maybe it is.

[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.220]
This is what we're dealing with.

[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:37.800]
And then of course,

[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.640]
Reverend Jones was there.

[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.220]
And I wish that he could have been here today to hear a feral describe him.

[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:42.600]
Your gay.

[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.860]
Said you're disgusting subhuman piece of crap.

[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.460]
What a surprise.

[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.380]
He's a big fat slob.

[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.860]
Big fat slob unshaven.

[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.220]
He said he took up three seats with his gigantic ass.

[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.000]
So I'm delighted that we're breaking feral in.

[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.160]
He can really get the smell, the feel, the lay of the land,

[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.100]
especially the smell part.

[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.980]
It smells lovely.

[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.040]
That's why we're burning the incense.

[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.820]
Soon as he mentioned the guy with a Fanny Pack,

[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.060]
the guy with the eyes of Reverend Jones.

[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:03.860]
Your gay.

[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:04.660]
We lit the incense.

[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.960]
I've been pretty active here though all week.

[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.100]
They're just milling around just.

[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:09.760]
Oh, that's Neil.

[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.200]
Look at that.

[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:10.620]
Neil's here.

[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.100]
Not long.

[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.780]
Take a good look.

[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.020]
I'll be going very soon.

[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.620]
It is, seriously, I don't want to belly ache.

[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.740]
I don't want to be like a liner.

[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.520]
But I went out to the store last night.

[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.460]
And I walked outside.

[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.840]
This is like 730 at night.

[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.120]
It had to be 140 degrees.

[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.620]
And the humidity had to be 200%.

[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.900]
I'm thinking to myself, how did I survive all those years of this?

[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.160]
How do you, how do you do it?

[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.700]
How can you survive this?

[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.160]
You don't, you just suffer.

[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.640]
Even if there were people who liked baseball

[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.900]
getting back to a feral in his lies about the marlins,

[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.800]
he admitted by the way he lied.

[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.040]
He knows this is a bogus town.

[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.100]
But then he say that?

[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.400]
You heard him say that.

[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.500]
He did say it.

[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.140]
I'm not making stuff up and putting it in his mouth.

[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:48.420]
Nothing.

[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.900]
But it's just so damn inseparable.

[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.860]
So that's what we're dealing with an empty deck

[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.440]
is because anybody with a half a brain

[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.980]
who had the luxury of getting out of here, they're gone.

[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:57.860]
They got to be gone.

[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.680]
And I salute them.

[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.380]
More power to them.

[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.420]
I'll be right on their heels, man.

[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:02.960]
Getting out of here.

[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.380]
This is a swamp.

[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.640]
It is a goddamn swamp.

[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.140]
Not that I don't like it.

[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.080]
You don't understand that.

[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.640]
But it's a freaking swamp and it sucks.

[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.840]
12 minutes after 10 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.040]
Happy Thursday to it.

[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.680]
Tell you one thing, the week is going by fast.

[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.180]
And it's 10 to 2 thing.

[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.140]
This is a piece of cake, you know what?

[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.320]
And of course following him,

[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.260]
he kills like the first few minutes there with our crossover,

[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.240]
which is it's time for a break like before you even get your ass in his life.

[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.040]
Thanks a lot Scott, you're the best.

[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.660]
I mean, it's not not as exciting as following Moe,

[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.660]
but the type smoker will be up next in the guava eating spicken.

[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.580]
That little a boner boy.

[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.140]
Yeah, are we sure miss that?

[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.040]
Are we feeling the difference in the ambiance

[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.880]
and the building between those bad old days?

[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.720]
And now there's just a slight difference in the feel and the hallway.

[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.660]
It's a feeling something.

[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.600]
Hey, how low can those interest rates go?

[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.300]
In fact, Todd Wreck was in here a little while ago.

[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.360]
But sure was a real pain in the ass in that midget.

[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.460]
You know he was 165 pounds.

[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.420]
And he's like 51.

[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.740]
Now if financial group does the limbo rock under the lowest B finance rate,

[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.840]
you've ever heard of in your life.

[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.520]
How low is it?

[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.260]
I'll tell you, 1.95%.

[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.040]
That's true.

[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.600]
Now you can refinance your home or buy a new home and get a super low,

[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.000]
1.95% financing with financial group.

[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.840]
Call him today and find out how you do this.

[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.280]
Save yourself a crap load of cash.

[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.820]
Call 1-800-940-Lend.

[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.640]
That's 1-800-940-L-E-N-D.

[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.280]
If you're even thinking about refinancing or buying real estate,

[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.160]
call financial group 1-800-940-Lend.

[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.480]
To talk about savings, listen to these

[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.860]
Paul tree payments you make.

[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.920]
If you have $100,000 alone, your payments are only

[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.880]
a mere 368 bucks a month.

[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.440]
If you have you wait $200,000,

[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.120]
your pay only $736 a month.

[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.400]
So call financial group.

[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.240]
It's a toll free call 1-800-940-Lend.

[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.240]
And don't tell you how this works.

[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.540]
And you'll get you a 1.95% financing rate.

[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.840]
Almost unheard of like I said.

[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.740]
1-800-940-Lend for financial group.

[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.040]
They're an equal housing lender.

[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.360]
Credit restrictions apply and rates are subject to change.

[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.860]
Monthly 5.1-9 APR.

[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.840]
We're supporting you 516-UAM.

[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.340]
Oh, yeah, with dancing with?

[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.260]
I like it.

[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.060]
I like it.

[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:17.040]
I like it.

[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.740]
Rudolph the scumbag bomber.

[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.100]
He was hiding in the woods.

[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:23.940]
That's a movie.

[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:29.060]
He's living like an animal just like a white supremacist.

[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:36.440]
He is the creep who's wanted for lighting the Olympic fused.

[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:43.020]
And for blowing up people who thought they had a right to choose.

[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:49.060]
And then one steamy summer tea would off-claimed a town.

[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.200]
While looking for some dumpster food.

[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.400]
A cop said freeze or I will shoot.

[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.480]
Now that the feds have caught him.

[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.260]
He's hiding in a jail cell.

[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:02.940]
That's a movie.

[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.820]
Rudolph the scumbag bomber.

[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.100]
Soon you're gonna fry in hell.

[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.880]
Okay, I don't want to let out of the bag,

[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.500]
but now that we've been playing that absolutely.

[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.920]
Drop in these last couple of days.

[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.040]
You know, Mo is gonna stick around because they

[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.120]
don't like paying anybody off to go away.

[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.980]
So he's gonna do drop-ins.

[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:22.920]
Do drop.

[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.520]
Do do do do do in his pants and then do a few drop-ins.

[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.240]
Am I right?

[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:27.780]
Absolutely.

[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:28.940]
Yeah, he's absolutely that.

[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.240]
He does probably the best drop-ins I've ever heard in my life.

[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.500]
Another train monkey.

[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.320]
Yeah, in fact, we might just play all of them today.

[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.800]
This is better than sex.

[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.000]
And my personal favorite.

[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.440]
Take off those checkered pants.

[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.840]
You're the best, Mo.

[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.500]
Just very briefly, you know, like a little snippets.

[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.180]
A little snippets speaking of clearance.

[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.020]
Yeah, clearance like, uh, looked like he was happy

[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.000]
enough to be in his right mind.

[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.120]
Yeah, how's it going?

[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.020]
He's a good kid, you know, clearance.

[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.900]
He's gonna get me paid on time on the 25th,

[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:56.280]
which is good.

[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:56.540]
Thanks.

[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.260]
The last of Pacea came in eight early.

[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.520]
clearance, you're the best, like I said.

[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.020]
He's a real master, huh?

[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.700]
Get the bonuses within a reasonable, uh, I don't know.

[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.440]
Get my bonus like bingo, man, like a shout out of a cany.

[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:08.840]
It's day.

[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.880]
He don't monkey around.

[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.420]
Cause he realized he's like skating on tonight.

[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.180]
Anyway, because Dufferty wants a job back.

[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.180]
Uh, here's the, what?

[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:16.820]
Nothing.

[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.080]
Oh, he, he really, he's very upset about that.

[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.100]
And I don't blame him.

[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.860]
Here's the, uh, deal.

[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.140]
Which of these do you care about most?

[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.340]
We ask if they know we have a similar poll today,

[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.460]
but a little bit better, I think.

[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.420]
We had 1464 votes.

[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.040]
Which of these do you care about most?

[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.740]
When is Mo's last day on the air?

[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.840]
You were left with spasters.

[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.020]
Won't cut the old man a break.

[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:36.560]
You know what I mean?

[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.440]
591 people said

[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.640]
that's what they're most concerned about.

[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.380]
When is Mo's last day on the air?

[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.320]
I, I, I, I, Middle East peace.

[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:48.620]
356.

[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.120]
Doesn't that disturb you?

[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.440]
Well, first of all, not only is it in oxymoron

[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.960]
and not going to happen, but even if it were going to happen,

[00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.600]
why are they so concerned about?

[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.320]
What's it to you?

[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.180]
Well, how does that affect the price of peanuts?

[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.460]
You know what I'm, what does that mean?

[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:04.620]
Right.

[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.740]
I'm concerned about one thing.

[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.900]
How does that affect the taste of your humontouch next,

[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.200]
Purim?

[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:08.900]
I don't think it does.

[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.800]
Who will be that often starting quarterback

[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.400]
this season?

[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.040]
186.

[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.600]
That's an important heavy-duty crack.

[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.720]
I agree with those people.

[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:16.880]
That's something they'll be worried about.

[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.160]
They got something really worthwhile

[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.920]
and they don't seem to care about it.

[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.180]
Is that for Wells Real Voice?

[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.920]
159 again, you forgot to remind me to ask him

[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.980]
whether it was a crime like that as a baby?

[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.520]
When is it?

[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.600]
When did his voice take a turn for that kind of sound?

[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.860]
Hey guys!

[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.880]
150-dollar concern.

[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.760]
Most about this, that for Wells Real Voice.

[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.500]
62, the Florida Marlins.

[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.500]
4.2%.

[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.520]
They had a little over 11,000 last night,

[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.340]
including the 200 plus that for Wells Real got in there.

[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.360]
So, uh, and that includes about 7 or 8,000 midfans.

[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.740]
There's nobody there.

[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.660]
Half of the Marlins are going to win 91 games this year.

[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.820]
Oh, and we'll get to that.

[00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.460]
On the next poll, we'll get to that in our survey.

[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.620]
Florida Marlins, only 62 people.

[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.260]
That's 4.2%.

[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.320]
Kids using cell phones at school.

[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.760]
George is very whipped up about that,

[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:07.560]
but most of you are not.

[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.960]
Only 60, 4%.

[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.960]
And if it all cast your Port Miguel,

[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.220]
he's going to be like a kick in his ass.

[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.200]
Realizing how far out of it,

[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.960]
you're right, he's got two out of three.

[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:18.680]
Yeah.

[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.000]
He's got that Marlin finish,

[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.360]
which he was there last night at the game.

[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.140]
It didn't even get laid,

[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.140]
unlike Beenerboard.

[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.260]
Where did he go, by the way?

[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:25.420]
Beenerboard.

[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:25.960]
Who the hell did that?

[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.840]
Well, he probably went down for another faggot break.

[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.040]
One of those.

[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.560]
Probably hanged out with Robert.

[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.520]
Kids using cell phones at school 60,

[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.620]
and Phidel Castro 51.

[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.100]
Nobody cares about Phidel.

[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.280]
Not like that.

[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.340]
We're proud of our audience.

[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:42.740]

[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.780]
Even maybe dwindling,

[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.500]
and maybe diminishing,

[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.280]
and maybe vanishing.

[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.120]
But that's not the important thing.

[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.200]
The important thing is our audience

[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.260]
has got their priorities, right?

[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.360]
Far more than care about when most last day on air

[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.860]
is coming as opposed to a crack.

[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.180]
Crap, like Phidel Castro.

[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.460]
Oh, yeah, but those two got,

[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.860]
in fact, it was in the sunset and the old yesterday,

[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.920]
and it was in a herald today.

[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.660]
That's one of the favorite things

[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.700]
that I see when I'm here.

[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.680]
Is that there'll be a story

[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.720]
in one of the two papers on a, like, on a Monday?

[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.800]
And then the next day,

[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.440]
oh, guess what?

[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.000]
The other major paper discovered it.

[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.480]
Oh, so they must read the competition.

[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:18.680]
What a pity.

[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.160]
Oh, God.

[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:20.860]
I hate some.

[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.920]
Makes my goddamn knees knock.

[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:23.880]
It makes me so weak.

[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.380]
Good.

[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.160]
God almighty.

[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.340]
Nobody cares about Phidel.

[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.500]
Only a bunch of old dominoes

[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.820]
playing a bean-sucking losers.

[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.680]
Diner and goddamn little Havana.

[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.020]
Youngest of whom is about 110.

[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:36.580]
Right?

[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.800]
Just sweating their brains out.

[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.620]
Or they play, they play in the shade,

[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.600]
where it's like about 95.

[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.240]
Let's ask Carlos what he does.

[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.040]
They play in the shade.

[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:45.820]
In the shade.

[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:46.120]
See?

[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.800]
Anyway, so that's yesterday's pull.

[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:48.860]
I'll be for you about today's.

[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.160]
Let's take a peek how that Hot Couple's contest

[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:51.960]
is coming.

[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.640]
It's not a contest at this moment.

[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.120]
Well, I know what you're laughing.

[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.440]
What you're charting about.

[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:56.920]
True.

[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.920]
It's a runaway.

[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.820]
I see if I had the energy, which I don't.

[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.240]
I reach back there and get Dil Shannon.

[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:05.960]
I play runaway.

[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.440]
But I don't.

[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.160]
Plus they be saying, what's that?

[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.060]
What's that?

[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.000]
What's that dodging old man playing now anyway?

[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.420]
684 votes at our Hot Couple contest.

[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.940]
Frank and Litt is 684.

[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.120]
Are you believing that?

[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:20.740]
Don't answer.

[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.280]
Well, I mean, I, yeah, I try to stay on the sidelines

[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.100]
at this whole thing, but that seems to be a pretty

[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.340]
gigantic lead over like Brian and Natasha

[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.380]
in second place with 305.

[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.600]
And they seemed to have a pretty damn good grip

[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.460]
on second anyway.

[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.300]
So that in which is good.

[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.820]
Because the first prize couple wins a trip

[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.280]
for two to the Bahamas or three days and two nights

[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.880]
or Jamaica to that joint.

[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:44.840]
He didn't.

[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.380]
He didn't.

[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.260]
I'm trying to get that out of my vocabulary.

[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.580]
Trying not to be a proverb like you in the rail.

[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.060]
Holly and Deer in 206.

[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.840]
So first, the second place I like, I'm pretty good.

[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.860]
And third place is what is it?

[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.260]
Jennifer to the pizza lot.

[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.020]
And you get to hang out with Jeff Cohen

[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.500]
and suck his fingernails.

[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.880]
Holly and Deer in 206.

[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.400]
Mike and Kristen 200.

[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.320]
And then a shocker only 196 from Mary and Shane.

[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.620]
As she continues exhibiting a gigantic smile

[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.760]
right on her breasts.

[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:12.780]
She's a trooper.

[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.560]
Have you noticed that her breasts are smiling?

[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.800]
Which I can't say I've seen that very often in my life.

[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:17.680]
I'm smelling back out of it.

[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.540]
I'm sure you are.

[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.820]
Ian and Jen have 178 votes.

[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.360]
Greg and Stephanie 140.

[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:26.700]
inexplicably,

[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.740]
Denny and Michelle 138 are lagging far behind.

[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:30.940]
And they should be doing a little bit better.

[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.960]
And that captain singing his wife 101,

[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.300]
even though he is lovely.

[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.580]
Vicki and Mick 91.

[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.740]
Dan and Sherry 46.

[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.780]
And way down near the bottom,

[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.060]
Rich and Sheryl 35.

[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.660]
They're kind of like drooping near the bottom.

[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.980]
And they votes too.

[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.600]
And also, white on the bottom, poor Jody and Kevin 23.

[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.460]
A little better photography next time.

[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.400]
Do you do you better justice Jody and Kevin?

[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.980]
Okay, because your second win in last place.

[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.640]
23 votes out of 2343.

[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:01.940]
See what I'm saying?

[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:02.960]
It's fairly simple math.

[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.020]
Like about one out of 100, which is like 1%.

[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.140]
Next time you'll do better, Jody and Kevin,

[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.660]
because next time you'll send us a better picture.

[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.060]
It looks like, uh, what do they call that stuff?

[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.960]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.520]
Uh, what is it?

[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.220]
What was the word?

[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:17.920]
Cepia?

[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:19.740]
Well, what do you know?

[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.560]
He's mouthing it for me now.

[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:22.860]
I can't hear you.

[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:23.940]
Cepia, I know.

[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:24.680]
I just said it.

[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:25.900]
You idiot.

[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:26.840]
I know I do two things.

[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:27.980]
Now where the hell were you?

[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.980]
Where were you in that other excuse,

[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:30.760]
absent-stair?

[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.200]
Did anybody,

[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.080]
did you raise your hand?

[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.120]
It has to be excuse, no.

[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.740]
Where the hell were you?

[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.300]
His stomach is on this stuff.

[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:38.740]
Was-

[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.480]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.620]
I can't imagine why.

[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.440]
Can you?

[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.580]
I can't begin to imagine why.

[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.100]
Why he fell over to the goddamn shower.

[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.360]
Almost broke the goddamn bathtub last night.

[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.520]
Three o'clock in the morning trying to go take a leak.

[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.860]
Peas all over himself, all over his clothes.

[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.300]
All over the goddamn shower.

[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.380]
Bricks the shower curtain.

[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.580]
Bust off the whole corner of the damn thing.

[00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.800]
But he found a penny.

[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.120]
But he found a penny.

[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.680]
Now that's about two hours work for him in this place.

[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.040]
So you see, you already got a head start in your paycheck.

[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:07.860]
What do you bitching about?

[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.220]
Plus, clearance is back from Omaha.

[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:10.260]
Omaha now you're safe.

[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.220]
He will.

[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.480]
If you go from Omaha.

[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.020]
And if you go in there and service him before lunch break,

[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.400]
you might even get your stub tomorrow.

[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:17.860]
Yeah, he said to give you.

[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.200]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.440]
I think that was for real.

[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.080]
Our clothes do it.

[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.200]
He just puked in clearances doorway.

[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.740]
Yeah, it's kind of a party week here at QA

[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.500]
because we realize we're all alone.

[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.380]
We're alone.

[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.060]
Yeah, if I pretty soon you'll be alone.

[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:35.500]
I know.

[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.860]
And I'm pleased to say that.

[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.100]
Okay, here's today's poll.

[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.500]
Let's not dick around here too much.

[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.420]
Okay, let's get to it because we got heavy duty.

[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.920]
In fact, you know what I'm going to do today and tomorrow?

[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:44.500]
I give up.

[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.040]
I miss you all.

[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:45.440]
Nothing.

[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:48.100]
Revolutionary.

[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:48.740]
No, not seriously.

[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.420]
I'm just going to I'm going to schmooze.

[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.260]
Whoever calls, I'll schmooze with the, uh,

[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.420]
I got a whole bunch of good stuff here like that.

[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.500]
Stir about the fridge.

[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.940]
A water, uh, what's the name William refrigerator, Perry?

[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.000]
Remember when he played for the bears?

[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.920]
Remember that, right?

[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.760]
Anyway, he's going to be in a hot dog eating contest.

[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.300]
And Mad Dog had a great line about him yesterday.

[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.700]
He said that he's as dumb as a box of rocks,

[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:09.820]
which I thought was great.

[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.340]
He's been doing all of these not quite sports

[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.900]
events like in the contest.

[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.360]
He was wrestling a grizzly bear the other day.

[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.200]
I something like that.

[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:18.760]
The man talk.

[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.540]
The refrigerator, baby.

[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.020]
The refrigerator.

[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.500]
The 400 pound counter.

[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.520]
Everyone with them great athletes can play on the line and football.

[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.640]
All those wichita alignment.

[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.220]
They're beautiful.

[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:31.860]
Although Clarence said he'd take a month.

[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.240]
Let me do the break and then we'll give you the pool for today,

[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.360]
which I think is a pretty good one.

[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.620]
George, I can like it too much because you get a chance to rip him in there.

[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.060]
But why not?

[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.960]
That they like that they enjoy it a lot.

[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.560]
Get a chance to rip Clarence too.

[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.160]
How do you like that?

[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.280]
This is, have you seen a pool?

[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:44.820]
No.

[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:45.760]
Oh, you'll love it.

[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.580]
But let me do the break first because we can kill what?

[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.420]
Probably at least a half an hour on a pool.

[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.300]
No, I just want it like today and tomorrow.

[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.320]
We're just killing some time.

[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.780]
I'm not going to lie to you.

[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.280]
I'm not doing a show today or tomorrow.

[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.280]
I'm just going on strike.

[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.760]
Especially because it's so goddamn hot and it's, it's, it's oppressive here.

[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.140]
It's nasty.

[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.440]
When it's not raining, you wish you prayed that it would, you know?

[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.860]
Because it like cools it off a couple of degrees.

[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.640]
You just pray for like a big massive storm.

[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.080]
For a big blow.

[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.780]
The Neil Deals keep on rolling from Tom Lavin into a

[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.420]
Prieto at Halibut Pontiac GMC.

[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.120]
By the way, before we tell you about Halibut Pontiac,

[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.080]
if you haven't seen the pictures on the website on our new improved website,

[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.720]
you must see clearance in the beast in a lip lock.

[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.400]
And then of course that lovely picture of Mo and Gildi doing the tango.

[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.980]
That's, that's one of my all-time favorites.

[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.500]
Gildi by the way left here this morning.

[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.720]
I was like, hmm, like that.

[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.520]
He did. He was like, hmm, a little higher picture than I can make it.

[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.200]
He was squeaking.

[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.060]
Well, I think that most trying to like stab him in the back so that he can

[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.740]
for help can do the show together and when it doubts squeeze Gildi out.

[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.520]
Here's Neil Deals number one right now at Halibut Pontiac.

[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.000]
Even Binaura could almost afford that.

[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.180]
It's a 36-month lease.

[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.920]

Take it home, take it to work, take it to the Marlin game, wherever the hell you like it.

[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.880]
And of course, it's always how it's got a humongous selection of certified pre-owned cars,

[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.400]
trucks and SUVs, the likes of which you've never seen.

And if your credit is marginal, if you want the new Jeff DeForest,

[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.480]
they won't turn you down.

[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.800]
They'll still cut your deals somehow at Halibut Pontiac GMC.

[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.260]
And you'll find them in the same great place.

[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.060]
They've been doing business for over 35 years.

[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.340]
134-01 South Dixie Highway.

[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.680]
That's US one across from the falls.

[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.440]
Open every day, seven days a week.

[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.720]
By the way, remember the Josec and Succo story ahead on Monday?

[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:52.320]
Yeah.

[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.920]
Well, evidently, Greg Cotex left out of the story.

[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.540]
I forgot, mad dog mentioned yesterday.

[00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.380]
He's under house arrest for two years.

[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.180]
Right, it got mentioned.

[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.420]
Did it get mentioned in the story?

[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.800]
I forgot mentioning that.

[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.940]
I thought we had the blundered.

[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:04.900]
I thought you had made a mistake.

[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.600]

[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.260]
Professional grade.

[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.160]
Is this any more 20-year-old 5!

[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.040]
This is too way up.

[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.240]
It's a� отдел.

[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.580]
That'sätzoodman.

[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.060]
Some movies.

[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.100]
So much to see.

[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.880]
Some movies.

[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.440]
We never agree.

[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.280]
He likes guy films where things blow up.

[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.720]
She likes girl films.

[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.620]
They make me throw up.

[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:55.900]
Some of the fix members is chicks and cause all the arguments

[00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:00.240]
Well, well, well, well, well, let's see this, let's see this

[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.820]
What a hell of a good cry

[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.740]
How about this, how about this, wanna see people die?

[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.160]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.620]
Wanna go to Terminator 3

[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:16.740]
You can go but you won't take me

[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.080]
How about something with Reese with a phone?

[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.720]
Not unless she shows us her moves

[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.200]
Summer bites when you get into fights

[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.760]
Over one film to see tonight

[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.160]
Well, well, well, well, well, well

[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.020]
Let's see this, let's see this

[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.680]
Cause the actor is cute

[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.440]
How about this, how about this, cause they're jokes about proof

[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.260]
This is great, oh that's right that's not done yet

[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:43.600]
I'm sorry

[00:27:43.600 --> 00:28:01.280]
This is great though, fake

[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.920]
There we go, there we go

[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.020]
What's that, dead babies?

[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.240]
1035 and 560, we got some curse, I'll be so excited to see

[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.600]
He's actually gotta see this physically

[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.660]
It just came in a mail, this overhead by the way is screwed up again real bad

[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.680]
But don't mess with it, of course, so you idiot stand and hear what I'm on here

[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.700]
I'll breathe on you

[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.880]
I'll take a dump right in your goddamn face

[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.400]
I will, I'll just go right up to him and turn it loose

[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.340]
What do you laugh at about?

[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.660]
After all that bacon you don't think you got a little spare in there

[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.500]
So here is from an ant guy, what's his guy's name?

[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.840]
Jerry Goodman from A Safe Pass, the Limitator's Inc

[00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.780]
Manufacturers of Uncle Albert's Super Smart product

[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.360]
Didn't they beat him to do a song about that?

[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:01.880]
Lately?

[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.480]
Yeah, last week

[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.280]
1113, oh here it is now, wait till you see where you apply

[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.580]
Since you're such a cheap prick that Greg is a cheap prick, we'll get an exterminator in here

[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.180]
Here you go, wanna present it right to you personal

[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.220]
In fact if you bend over I'll give you the first exterminating shot

[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.260]
Now seriously, look at that lube thing, what do you call that thing?

[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:20.920]
A lube tube

[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.980]
That's the old lube tube

[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.840]
Look at his face line up, look at that

[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.880]
He said boy, he wishes he would have had that with him in Omaha

[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.120]
Yeah, he said he thought the hurricane took it up the ass, but anyway

[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.360]
See now I'm using Pharrell's material, I'm sorry

[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.580]
Don't let him say that when he's doing the Panther game next season

[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:39.440]
Okay, don't let him say the Panthers are taking it up the ass because that's what got him in big trouble in Atlanta

[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.460]
And anyway, so there you go, because I think it's criminal

[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.220]
Seriously, I think it is so, it's bad enough this non-smoking thing

[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.780]
Oh, you can't smoke in a building and it's gonna get our insurance rate

[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.420]
So you didn't really give a crap if we burned this damn building down because it's a toilet anyway

[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.380]
Even the goddamn roaches have gotten out of here

[00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:00.840]
But the fact of the matter is they're so goddamn cheap that they're worried about cutting that insurance rate back a little bit

[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.440]
So that's why they come up with this, oh, everybody now is doing non-smoking buildings

[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:09.300]
And so if you want to puff on a nice Stogie or if they're like smoking a nice fat number in the other room

[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.500]
Or maybe Carlos wants to puff on one of them camels

[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.200]
Because wine style tastes good like an old Jewish cigarette should

[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.420]
And he's puffing away and smoking and coughing and gagging and choking up his thumb

[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.520]
You'll never make it to 30, I'll tell you that right now

[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.380]
Which is not that far off

[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.360]
Never make it

[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:31.440]
Melanova, lung cancer, syphilis, di-bubes

[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.560]
Carcinogens and ad bacon will give you a tumor to size of god damn Montana

[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.460]
But other than that, he's doing pretty good. He's having a problem it's called life

[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.080]
So thank you very much, Jerry Goodman, he sent us a hole now

[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.480]
I don't know what you do with these, in fact, oh, of course my fight is over

[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.040]
Well those go with the injector

[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.580]
That's what you inject

[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.180]
What is this the whole appearance of the cheeks open?

[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.560]
Because that's what they look like

[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.080]
You suck the goo out of the bottle

[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.040]
Is that what it is?

[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.860]
He's gonna have him a...

[00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.800]
Did you notice how he ran out of here with that stuff?

[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.840]
And then the chamber's come back, Clarence, there's more to it

[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.820]
And you're with a door lock now

[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.760]
Oh my god

[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.300]
Back to him

[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.900]
Poor Clarence, you need a little box of it

[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.760]
Clarence, don't take it so hard, please sweetheart

[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:08.920]
He'll take it anyway

[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.380]
So anyway, we got the new pull is up, I haven't even given it out yet

[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.600]
Thanks again, Jerry Goodman, he says, Zygazant, good Jewish boy

[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.140]
Oi

[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.260]
Who's trying to help us with our problem here so that Pharrell don't have to be some kind of a lemon

[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.200]
I still think that's so freaking embarrassing

[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.780]
I mean, next to Greg, there is nobody in this building

[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.200]
More obsessed with Pharrell than Clarence

[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.280]
I mean, obsessed, he's got a blow-up doll already in there

[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.380]
He said the one thing he missed the most being Omaha

[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.500]
Was not being able to be in there and bond with Pharrell

[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.680]
And a suck up to him, although I missed the beast made up for a lost time

[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.820]
Kind of filled the breach

[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:44.980]
So to speak

[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.340]
So you think that he want to be nice to the guy, wouldn't you?

[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:48.740]
Huh?

[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.760]
You think he'd want to make a good impression?

[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.800]
Hey, look at me, I'm the 15-year-old program director, look at me, I'm gonna treat you nice

[00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:00.080]
And instead, no eating in that studio, no more food on this table out here

[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.760]
See, the reason you don't want food on the table out there is too close to his room

[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:04.320]
Is that it?

[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.160]
That must be it, because he was just punishment for making a big stinker

[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.080]
Because he doesn't eat any way, which makes me very suspicious

[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.380]
You know what I mean about Clarence? He must be doing something

[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:13.820]
Oh, I'm done

[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.240]
Don't say that, see, just the kind of person that you wouldn't expect

[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.020]
Like, everybody's got something, you know?

[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.840]
Yeah, but the furrell blow up darling, gonna keep him happy all the time

[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.260]
They're always telltale sites

[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.920]
Yeah, like remember our old friend, Harry?

[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.040]
I know the one you're talking about, but I'm trying to divert you real fast and then

[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.780]
There are mannerisms, you mean like Harry?

[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:36.520]
Yeah

[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.180]
A little bit hyper, a little bit spastic

[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.280]
Oh, I know something like that, twitchy

[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.380]
I wasn't thinking even about you, I was thinking about somebody else

[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:49.540]
So anyway, I probably need to food in there, be nice to the guy and quit making him come in here like shovel that food

[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.500]
That's not good for him

[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.400]
I mean he thinks it's funny, I guess, but it's funny to watch

[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.380]
He's speed eating

[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.460]
He is speed eating, man, he is just making himself sick

[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.800]
Because he's got to eat real fast and shovel it and you'll notice he doesn't leave anything

[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.920]
Whatever how he sends over, he eats every drop

[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.300]
While you're, folks at how he's thank you very much and number two, don't worry nothing's getting thrown out

[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:14.080]
There are many morselets in there, he gets into his pus sooner or later, but just, man

[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.920]
I've never seen anybody eat so much so fast

[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:22.180]
So like I said, you know he ain't doing that because he's got a healthy appetite

[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:25.760]
Right, it's just, well not you because you're skinny anyway, beener

[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.820]
But what I would give for his metabolism

[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.560]
Oh, see those of us who really appreciate and love food, who are just obsessed with food

[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:39.520]
And our metabolism is like barely moving, just barely even showing on the Richter scale

[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:39.840]
Right

[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.360]
And so all we have to do is look at food and there's another ounce and another half an ounce

[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:49.960]
And here's a guy that I don't think he enjoys it that much because he doesn't put it in his mouth long enough to taste it

[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.480]
And the food either, right?

[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.800]
He just scarves

[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.280]
He just sucking it down just like my golden retriever used to do the same thing

[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.420]
I don't think he ever tasted any bit of food in his life because it was always, oh, oh, oh

[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.940]
And it just went down like, you know, in a mass

[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.240]
Never tasted it, he was just filling like a hole

[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.000]
You know what I'm saying, clearance?

[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.140]
So here's the, I guess we'll do it after the break

[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.640]
No, it's a good pull, it's already got a bunch of votes on there

[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.880]
And I can see that Bush is going to do well today again, good

[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.560]
We don't want to stop picking on Bush, do we?

[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:17.760]
No

[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.740]
We don't want to stop picking on a Bushmaster because he is dangerous

[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:26.200]
And now you'll notice, now they're rattling their spirit a little bit about Iran again

[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.480]
Did you see that in the news last night?

[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:28.020]
Yeah

[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:28.460]
Oh, yeah

[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:34.900]
Things are looking a little bit on the lame side and that would should be a good diversion from those weapons of mass deception

[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.440]
So, yeah, let's start rattling our spirit about Iran because they were, yeah

[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:45.960]
All those democracy seekers over there, all of our good friends who probably were pretty pissed off at us when we stuck the shaw in there

[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.100]
Don't like us all that much

[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:49.820]
Nah, they're rattling their spirit

[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:55.200]
So what we want to do is go in here and lend them a helping hand and prevent the Ayatollah from building those nuclear weapons

[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.160]
Another weapon he's probably hiding under his robes

[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.080]
That's where the Pope is hiding him

[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.140]

Why, in local, we're sports radio 560-CUA-U-A-A

[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:25.480]
It's in my room before I start because I'm getting high from the smell of my parts

[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.980]
Said bugs are eating my brain and that might explain my eye going insane

[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:36.960]
Something buggy may something a knife must have been the 49-8 last night

[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:42.540]
And lying here seeing in my bed and free clothes to see death

[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:45.240]
Pick me up, I've got a go-go

[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:49.160]
This is your briefly can't do it solo, pick me up

I've got a go-go, I don't want to smell this for my eyes

[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.960]
Pick me up, I've got a go-go, before my diaper turns the color of a buckle

[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:05.640]
Pick me up, I've got a go-go, I've got a tell, yes, good night

Pick me up and listen me away in your big strong arms like I'm Dora's date

[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:28.480]
My heart is fading away and at 20 feet per minute I could go any day

[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:34.160]
Now that's not much of a joke, I'm playing here in the pool of my drool

[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.300]
Archers, Michelin, dead, has my senior this way

[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.820]
I can't help this fight

[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:45.560]
Pick me up, I've got a go-go from a sleepy cat, my flow hole

[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:51.480]
Pick me up, I've got a go-go, before my diaper turns the color of a buckle

[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:56.540]
Pick me up, I've got a go-go, this is your briefly can't do it

[00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:00.200]
That'd be funny, 1047 and 560 W.C.M. the Mad Dog 2-4

[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.960]
We got the Humper in the studio 4-630, another one of them tough shows

[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.280]
Two and a half hours, nice going hang

[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:11.800]
And then 630 got Marlins on deck, 7-05, they met Santa Marlins again at PP Park right on the street

[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.120]
What do you think we get about tonight?

[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.720]
About 30 people

[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.880]
Yeah, because for all they're gonna be there tonight we're not gonna have all that other

[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:18.640]
You're gonna be there?

[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:19.900]
Would you get more free tickets?

[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:20.400]
Yeah

[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:24.560]
Peter Boy's gonna be there, he got more free tickets, he's thinking maybe he'll get laid again there at night

[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.000]
You're gonna be in the pool and the, oh, ha ha ha ha ha

[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.660]
Great!

[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.800]
The Florida Marlins and the House of Prostitution, that's what we want

[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.000]
Oh, I'm telling you!

[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.240]
See, they think that I'm a bad guy that I'm peeing on their parade

[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:42.000]
I'm hoping that they do something, like go away

[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.180]
They keep doing things like that, like pool parties

[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:47.300]
If they keep having pool parties and guys keep getting laid there

[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.800]
And they have a place for degenerates like with the guy with the eyes, the guy with a fanny pack

[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.800]
And the Reverend Jones to go and hang out and Shmoos with Ferrell and Beener Boy

[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:59.380]
And maybe somebody rubs up against somebody like real squirt squirt just accidentally

[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.040]
They could just fire the team, save the money, nobody's gonna do that

[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.900]
They're gonna have that honor elected to legitimize, you know, to pretend that it's legitimate

[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:09.340]
Because otherwise if they say it's like a place of ill-reputed then right away they'll close it down

[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.180]
These guys and people off the street to play baseball, they'll do it for cheap or free

[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.560]
That's a thought, that's what Wayne had in mind

[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:14.980]
Or better

[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:19.220]
So here's the pool for today, before we start our Shmoos Fest

[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:23.800]
Now you can see on a phone we're doing screenless this week and you can see that they're ready really do an outpouring

[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.280]
Rock and roll

[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.580]
Make no mistake

[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.260]
Which of these statements is the most ridiculous we asked today?

[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.720]
Let's see we got 367 that I thought were pretty interesting

[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:37.500]
George W. Bush is a great leader, that's in the lead by the way already 58 votes

[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.220]
Nice going W

[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.500]
Uh, should I read him the way I have him on a pool or the way they are and I guess the way they are on the other thing

[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.180]
Because we got 123 votes already, haven't even read the pool

[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.120]
Which of these statements is the most ridiculous?

[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:54.600]
George W. Bush is a great leader 58, more Howard David is a great show, 21

[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.000]
George is a great villain for Neil, 16

[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.140]
Pieces coming in the middle east, 15

[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.420]
Farrell has a pleasant voice, 5

[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.660]
And tied for last place is one of the ones that I voted for

[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.060]
Tied for last

[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.000]
The Marlins of Win 91 games has got four votes

[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.100]
But I voted for, Clarence, our program director will get laid this year only four votes, one of those being mine

[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.160]
What are you smoking about?

[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.320]
You just, we don't know what's going on there really

[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.300]
Let me say it again, oh I know what's going on

[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.140]
It's called masturbation, lots of it

[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.480]
Uh, which of these statements is the most ridiculous?

[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.140]
So you're not listening to the question again, you're getting like the audience

[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:34.740]
Which is the most ridiculous?

[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:38.840]
Clarence will get laid this year, absolutely hysterical, it's a panic

[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.140]
It's a hoot

[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.700]
In addition to which the bees to be jealous anyway

[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.880]
Now look at the smiles in their faces

[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:50.840]
They look so content man, they look like, uh, Elsie DeVordan-Kahle, they look so content

[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.500]
Just haven't been firstly milked

[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.500]
Isn't that what they both look like?

[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.640]
Oh yeah, the bees then, and of course the moan-gully pictures

[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.860]
It really amusing because probably the two of them at this point are more at odds than ever before

[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:10.940]
Because it's just, you know, just a matter of time before the other shoe drops in that deal

[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:15.180]
But look at the beast with a big broad smile on his push

[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:18.180]
And those big broad shoulders and that manly body

[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.340]
He says that's the body he has under the thigh

[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:25.060]
And Clarence, with the, uh, I have never seen he smiling ear to ear

[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.120]
And a real lady is your feminist body there too

[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:28.960]
Ha ha ha ha

[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:32.720]
So I have to take back what I said last week about who the top was in that pairing

[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.000]
I have to take that back

[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.940]
Because after looking at Clarence in that picture I think

[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.300]
There could only be one reason to be smile on like that

[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.480]
Anyway, maybe they switched

[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.760]
Maybe they switched?

[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:47.260]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line

[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:50.720]
Maybe we could invite all the chronicsticals in the end of the moral, and then you'd do the show

[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:57.300]
Don't forget to look for the Q&A and noon to one day at Palm Metal Kawasaki located at 6400 West 20th Avenue in Hylia

[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.380]
The lovely, the hung Miguel will be there

[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.620]
Stopped by to win free tickets tonight's Marlins Vets Game

[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.760]
courtesy of the real yellow pages from Billsau

[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.660]
Tickets tonight to Marlins Vets Game

[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.880]
Miguel be given away, any takers out there?

[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.160]
Beanable took a pair

[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:11.140]
He's got a pair

[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.960]
So for else as he had a couple hundred people there last night now

[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.120]
Other people have given me varying reports

[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.520]
Even the B's who sucks his ass so hard it's like almost illegal in Dave County

[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.760]
He said about 80 or 90

[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:26.740]
And the Haseedam that they called in a mode this morning they said like about 80

[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:29.240]
But we'll see how well humorful we're for real

[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.740]
There about couple hundred people there last night

[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.880]
And 50 people in the pool area all just hopped on top of each other just grabbing it

[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.400]
See that was his definition of getting laid last night, Beanable

[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:43.260]
That was his definition

[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.980]
Somebody grabbed something in the pool

[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.980]
Oh my mind just went on

[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:53.300]
Yeah

[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.900]
They thought somebody dropped their baby Ruth in the pool I think is what it was

[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.820]
But anyway, I don't know

[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.860]
5,6,7,0,5,60

[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:01.420]
It was like Marquis

[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:03.620]
He's

[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:04.560]
About 5,60

[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.100]
And they probably think that I'm making a story of about him like

[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.920]
Going to take a leak in three in the morning and being so drunk on his ass

[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.240]
That he fell back into the goddamn bathtub

[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:16.340]
And peed all over himself and all over the goddamn wall and everything in sight

[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.960]
That's our beaner boy man that's the one

[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.140]
He's the best

[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.840]
He is life challenged

[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:23.920]
WDQAM

[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:24.880]
Yeah

[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:25.740]
Yes sir

[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.620]
When does George odd do the start doing the shows

[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:33.660]
When does George, why would you like to have about 11 o'clock?

[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.140]
He's one of the best

[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:35.820]
Is he?

[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.700]
Yeah I love him, he talks about the swing clubs

[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:39.540]
He's been in a

[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.180]
Slave at Magazine with Lisa Lev

[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:43.160]
He's the greatest

[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.720]
Okay, about 1130

[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.520]
Oh thank you

[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.120]
Okay you're welcome

[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:47.540]
1130 George

[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:48.840]
It's one of your people

[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.240]
Yeah

[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.320]
He's another one similar to Clarence's twin brother

[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.260]
He was a crank

[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.440]
Can't get laid

[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.260]
5,6,7,0,5,60

[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.240]
Pound 5,60

[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.820]
In fact you noticed that the people that show up at these events are the people who cannot get laid

[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.820]
They'd like the guy with a fanny pack and a guy with the eyes

[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.280]
Right, if you could get laid you'd be doing that

[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.760]
Instead of being at the Amarlan game

[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.540]
Shmuzin around with a bunch of you know

[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.220]
WACOS

[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.480]
77 votes for George W. Bush

[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.220]
That's a shocker

[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.740]
I think it's unpatriotic

[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:15.480]
WQAM

[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.880]
And now we've seen Norm Cantad in the business section today

[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.920]
Norm Cantad for what?

[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:25.380]
There's Marlan Marlins to command ads and South Florida Gay with him

[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.000]
He fasted me that weeks ago

[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:27.680]
That's an old strike

[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.720]
Get out of here you loser

[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.980]
See I told you this is going to be exciting today

[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:31.720]
Norm Cantad, Marlins is loose

[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.180]
No I am going to enjoy it tremendously

[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.960]
And don't mention Norm Cantad on this show ever again

[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:37.880]
OK, cause me yesterday

[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.180]
Oh I got a great idea of the New Rogers Bobble Head Dolls for my charity

[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:45.120]
He's got an idea for how I can help him raise money for his charity

[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.380]
We got our own charity abandoned pet rescue

[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.240]
Which I just wrote out a big fat check to get the ball rolling on it

[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.620]
And we're going to have the best of CDs

[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:54.380]
And a whole bunch of those more Howard David and Keychains

[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:54.800]
That'd be funny

[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:55.900]
Yeah, those are coming out

[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:57.780]
Right

[00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.620]
Yeah, that would be funny

[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.760]
And I guarantee you, as big of a head as the mad dog ones

[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.560]
Where these are going to make those parallel to what significance

[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.200]
Absolutely

[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.080]
So you just mark my words

[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:10.180]
I know it's too late for that

[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:11.100]
No, no, this there

[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:11.920]
Oh we can get that in

[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.740]
Yeah, well please

[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.620]
That's got to be on a keychain

[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:15.160]
Absolutely

[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.720]
If you have your mad dog and Mohawarb Keychains

[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.940]
You can have them talk to each other

[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.080]
And answer each other

[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:20.480]
Uh huh

[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:21.880]
I'll work on that

[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:29.040]
Yes sir

[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.180]
I had a good idea, Mohawarb Keychains

[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.840]
And bring back Joey Reynolds and Goldie

[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:35.640]
How's that sound?

[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.860]
We got a phone I'm breaking you up, you sir

[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:41.200]
Okay, for some real assistance

[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:43.460]
For some very serious health

[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.640]
You see what I've always said?

[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:49.680]
All the little talented people out there

[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.660]
Just waiting for their opportunity to shine

[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.660]
For their moment in the spotlight

[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:56.880]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 on EAT and T in Verizon Line WQAM

[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.500]
We're just having a schmooze fest here

[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.540]
That's all we're doing to these people know how to do it

[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.860]
See I'm trying to resurrect what used to be a lot of fun doing a talk show in this town

[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.680]
Used to be great

[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:05.940]
Yeah

[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.580]
And I've gone all the way from now to being a little way too serious

[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:12.360]
Greenless bedtime stories that only George enjoyed

[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.620]
Way too much and I would get out of here

[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:15.480]
Such a suckhole

[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.920]
If I would have said him been licking the fudge all the summer long you would have said it was great

[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.560]
I do like fudge

[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:26.740]
Fudge is good, hot

[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.960]
Sun is hot fudge Sunday

[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:30.520]
Yeah

[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.740]
On fish food

[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.480]
With maraschino cherries

[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.140]
And real whipped cream

[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60

[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:39.300]
So we've tried all of that

[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:41.960]
But just to try just a little taste speaking of that

[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.380]
Just a taste to resurrect the good old days

[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.320]
Good luck

[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.900]
It'll be great

[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:47.400]
You'll see

[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:47.700]
All right

[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.480]
I mean if not I got a whole cramp load of stuff

[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.000]
A good stuff

[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:51.620]
Great

[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:53.140]
Will we see Gore TV?

[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:53.980]
Will we see that?

[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:54.280]
No

[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.280]
Oh that's the new rumor

[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.800]
Oh yeah we're going to have a Gore TV or radio

[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.120]

[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.060]
No

[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:01.340]
No

[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.540]
We'll leave that to the goddess

[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.080]
WQAM

[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:05.940]

From Neil Lewis

[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.780]
Neil Lewis?

[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:25.160]
How about radio?

[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:26.740]
Neil Lewis?

[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:26.780]

[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.740]
I thought he was going to be great

[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:38.040]
This is the best hour I've had in years

[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:41.020]
He hasn't got any idea what my name is

[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.720]
He hasn't got a clue what god damn my plan that he's on

[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.580]
But he wants some free god damn tickets

[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.320]
Welcome back to soft board and Neil

[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:47.840]
Yeah

[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:50.980]
God is this a great place or what huh?

[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:52.040]
What?

[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.280]
The next person who mentions free ticket for the marlins games

[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.280]
I'm going to tell you right now I'm going to do something nasty

[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.260]
I'm going to fix him up with clearance

[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.880]
I'll just turn it to you on the pool by the way don't tell me he's in the behind

[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.400]
He's in last place only six votes and one of those was mine

[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.800]
See they just don't know

[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.020]
Get those marlins tickets out of my face you idiot

[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.400]
See you know something about him

[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:17.460]
He's one of those people doing a fine job getting a lot of compliments

[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.440]
Getting a little extra smeared onto the table

[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.940]
But he doesn't know when to stop pushing it

[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:25.680]
You've met people like him just pushing it a little further every day

[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.880]
Yesterday he was throwing his yo-yo in a dust face

[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.040]
You were out taking a crap one of your four craps

[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.340]
He was like throwing his ass he was slinging it right in dust face all day long

[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:36.260]
And that's almost took a hold of it

[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:37.460]
Ten

[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:40.720]
Ten fifty eight

[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.120]
And pulled it which would have been a sad moment for you believe you me

[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.160]

We're having a big party over here

[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:20.380]
The beast is standing in there

[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.700]
Because he can't eat outside

[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:23.020]
Because his good bunk buddy

[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:24.220]
Clarence will let him do it

[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:27.500]
Now why are you got

[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:30.240]
Why do you have that facial mask

[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.020]
We're having an attack

[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:32.740]
A little bit of

[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.080]
Poor baby

[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.160]
He's having a little bit of a problem

[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:36.760]
And his pants of course

[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.720]
The beast he's standing there

[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:38.240]
He keeps eating

[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:38.780]
Sheldon away

[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:40.780]
If you took a dump on the chair

[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:42.080]
He wouldn't stop him from eating

[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.720]
Nobody can maintain that girth

[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.400]
By being a little squeamish

[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.380]
And not only is he standing there

[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:50.800]
With his 400 pounds up against the wall

[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.200]
He's sucking on oatmeal

[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:53.960]
Oh my god

[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.880]
There are a few things

[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.300]
So the beast, I mean, what's the same difference?

[00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:58.680]
Little beast, beener boy

[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.040]
He brings me back a fistful here

[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.680]
A fistful of Marlon tickets from

[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.640]
You know what we ought to do?

[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.480]
Let's give these away

[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.260]
Hey anybody wants a Marlon tickets from last night's game

[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:10.540]
I think they might lose 10 to 5

[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:12.260]
But nevertheless it'll be a great time at the pool

[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:14.020]
Huh?

[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.420]
And for all we'll be there last night

[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:17.700]
It's going to be great

[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:19.260]
If you missed it now you don't have to

[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:20.980]
All of Marlon executives are going to be there

[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:21.820]
Suck it up to Scott

[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:22.600]
It's going to be great

[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.600]
If you missed it here's some tickets so you don't have to miss out

[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:28.040]
Hey Malcolm McDalby of Aero

[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.580]
We put you in the time tunnel with him and James Deere and Pat Boone

[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:31.180]

[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:33.640]
I got some DVDs last night

[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.680]
But I'm not going to watch him yet

[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:36.500]

[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.280]

[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:37.980]
How do you like that?

[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:38.560]
It's about time

[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:39.360]
Clarence

[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.520]
Yeah, I got Snatch last night

[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.520]
Uh, 232 votes on the pool

[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.380]
GW Bush is a great leader, 108

[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.760]
George is a great fill in for Neil 36

[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.380]
He says coming in the middle east 36

[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.820]
You're tied with your uh, or 30

[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:56.800]
I'm sorry about 30

[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.180]
Moe Howard David is a great show 29

[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.760]
The Marlins are going to win 91 games

[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.000]
At least according to many of our callers earlier before the season started

[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:05.620]
12

[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.800]
Farrell has a pleasant voice 10

[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.900]
And Clarence again can't get out of last place

[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.700]
Clarence our program director will get laid this year

[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:16.200]
9 people say that's the most ridiculous statement of them all, including me

[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.620]
Maybe if you put by a girl, the results would be higher

[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.580]
No, I wasn't saying I wasn't thinking that

[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:24.600]
Oh, I was thinking about anything alive

[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.460]
Anything uh, breathing

[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:28.540]
Or a warm

[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:31.160]
Maybe not breathing but warm recently alive

[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.620]
So this was from Treasur Island last night, huh?

[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:38.680]
This fish is this this fissful of Marlin tickets that you guys couldn't give away

[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:39.460]
Oh no

[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:40.860]
We don't have to do

[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:43.860]
Hey Scott, I know you're on your way up to Bokeh and to play golf with the old man

[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:45.640]
But let me just say this to you, okay, seriously

[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.980]
And I don't know I'm Santa because he already knows it he admitted to me

[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.960]
He knew before we started what a bogus place this was

[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.500]
He's just having a good he's fun in here. That's all

[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:57.280]
He's funding in place. He's getting a little extra on the side

[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.980]
It was really interesting last night speaking of that

[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.280]
A lot of point you were there to Treasur Island

[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.900]
Oh, I thought you made it to Marlin game

[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.620]
A lot of people showed up to get the poison tickets that we said we were gonna have

[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.940]
Right, we did, right? And we asked them what do you want?

[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.500]
Poison or Marlin's tickets and they didn't even think you were talking about their concerts

[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:13.600]
They tell you like are they

[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.820]
The reaction it's like wait, we're not joking we're serious

[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.660]
You want concert tickets or Marlin tickets?

[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.780]
Oh my god, let me think about that for a couple of seconds, okay

[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.240]
Let me call my attorney and see what he says

[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:30.020]
Let me talk to Jonathan Edwards over there and see a cross, see what the dead people say about it

[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:33.120]
One, two, three, four, five, six

[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.820]
There's about a dozen tickets for like more than that

[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:36.760]
About 15

[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:41.060]
In fact, they're like all stuck together here because it's from Treasur Island

[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.920]
But third man, it might be that many

[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.380]
And couldn't give them away, couldn't give them away

[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:49.240]
In other words, they didn't have to go

[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.080]
These are people who were just taking them

[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:54.820]
They said oh yeah, well thank you very much and maybe thought about going like kind of way up the Hershey

[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:59.360]
Highway and away up the turn, maybe I don't think so, they're always behind 15 and nothing you know

[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:02.840]
But they wouldn't even touch them with their hands

[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:07.720]
That's how despicable this concept to go to a Marlin game was to these people

[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:14.660]
So let me say it again, do you silly people? Do people refuse to take a no for an answer like Norma can't speak into him?

[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.800]
Nobody cares

[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:21.160]
Look at that, see he's not a bit and you're right, it's it's a big yawn

[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:27.500]
Make no mistake about it, a big fat yawn

[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:35.460]
There's surgery for that

[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:42.300]
That by when there was the Beast debut on QAN that was his first time on the US when the Dirt of McLaren so much plus his shapely ass

[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.360]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line

[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:51.120]
We're having a Neil Rogers schmooza thaw today, and tomorrow, WDQAN

[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:53.460]
That's Neil how's it going?

[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:53.860]
Okay

[00:55:54.860 --> 00:56:00.960]
Hey, it's good to have you back inside Florida man and first thing you and for all the crossover is fantastic

[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.480]
Yeah, that's completely hilarious

[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.000]
He's a trip

[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:06.060]
And the Beast did suck in his first show

[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.840]
Oh, I heard you

[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.620]
Let me just tell you something, I told the Beast is stuck going

[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:15.060]
Like every time he opens up Playboy he's got some pictures of some hot naked babes in here

[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.800]
You know, stop sucking that much so this morning

[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:21.040]
Pharrell is talking about some Marlin executive or some guy that he met last night

[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:25.580]
They're not confused with the fact I'm willing grace and he said oh this guy's a real good guy and then Beast goes

[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:29.080]
Huh, which maybe the Beast has got the hots for the guy, I don't know

[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:32.460]
But I mean that's just it wasn't the appropriate sound to make at that point Beast

[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:34.380]
Sounds like they should put them in the magazine

[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.460]
Yeah, exactly

[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:40.420]
But I heard you mentioned Netflix the other day I was going to vouch for it

[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:40.960]
It's fantastic

[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.280]
Who's that on that line for us?

[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.000]
Thanks, yeah

[00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:46.040]
But Netflix is fantastic

[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:50.640]
If you're into the movie things like you guys have been you got to get ahold of it, it's great

[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.040]
You didn't mention movies did you?

[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:54.340]
Oh, sorry

[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.520]
See you

[00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:00.360]
We're not talking movies this week, okay? Or next week?

[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.200]
Or for the next several shows? Who is that?

[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:02.700]
It's Bob Lincoln

[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:08.280]
Hey, didn't anybody tell you that Bob Ackins died?

[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:09.320]
Yes

[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:09.820]
Oh

[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.200]
But what can you possibly want?

[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.200]
I wanted to give you a good news

[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:14.760]
Yeah

[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.140]
Viva Las Vegas I moved here

[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.460]
I'm sitting here as we speak

[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:20.560]
Oh, you moved to Vegas?

[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.480]
Yes, sir

[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:26.000]
See that doctor Bob Ackins had that nasty fall unfortunately never recovered and died

[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.880]
And Bob Lincoln being the wise guy that he is, so to speak

[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.160]
He figured he better get out of here while the game was good and moved to Vegas

[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.280]
And on that plane he was singing Viva Las Vegas

[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.800]
Sorry, I missed that

[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:39.180]
Boy, I'll tell you what a difference

[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:39.700]
Yeah

[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:41.100]
What a difference

[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:41.480]
I know

[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.060]
I should have done this a long time

[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:47.080]
Just like me being in Toronto, you know what a difference with pleasant, wonderful people

[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:51.960]
Living and breathing people under the age of 100 with a smile in their face and a hand in your pocket

[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:58.980]
My daughter's boyfriend and he jumped out of his skinny within the Albertsons and one of the employees came up and said

[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:00.240]
Can I help you with something, sir?

[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.440]
Yeah, yeah, shocking

[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:03.880]
Oh, totally

[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.920]
And service here, God forbid

[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.400]
That you will love

[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:22.180]
And I'm going to tell you what a difference with the fact that you are in Vegas

[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.760]
And I'm going to tell you what a difference with the fact that you are in Vegas

[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:25.220]
And I'm going to tell you what a difference with the fact that you are in Vegas

[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:25.960]
And I'm going to tell you what a difference with the fact that you are in Vegas

[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.160]
And I'm going to tell you what a difference with the fact that you are in Vegas

[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:30.460]
And I'm going to tell you what a difference with the fact that you are in Vegas

[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:37.380]
And I'm going to tell you what a difference with the fact that you are in Vegas

[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:39.220]
Yeah, there's a bunch of good stuff out there

[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:41.740]
Great, well listen, have a great life out there and keep in touch

[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:42.360]
I will

[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.040]
And say how to Dr. Bob

[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:44.740]
I will

[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.860]
He's going to be on Jonathan Edwards 3 o'clock this afternoon

[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:47.540]
Thanks Bob

[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:52.100]
Bob Lincoln, there's a guy boys happening back to memories or what?

[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:56.120]
Viva Las Vegas, oh there's the plane that's over there on the other side of the tarmac

[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.080]
You can't, oh

[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:03.320]
We want to apologize again to anybody in this audience who was on our Vegas trips those three years

[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:05.100]
Especially those two with Bob

[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:07.700]
He was email well and he was real tight with that rich

[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:11.540]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, see I want to see some response here today

[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.320]
This has been very lame

[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:16.440]
You know I realize there's nobody in town but I come back for a few days

[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:18.540]
I like to feel like somebody cares about it

[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.180]
You know like somebody feels something besides in the building

[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:23.020]
Oh Gene you'll have to go back more often

[00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:26.300]
Man they're all sucking me so hard out there in a hallway it's like I'm drained

[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:27.920]
Amazing you can make it to the studio

[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:28.460]
Exactly

[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:29.740]
God

[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:31.440]
Oh you have to go back more often

[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:31.660]
No

[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:32.520]
No I don't think so

[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.080]
This is more than enough believe me

[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:35.620]
More than enough

[00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:38.240]
And then I got that long winner to look forward to

[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:40.840]
Oh I don't know I'm gonna do that

[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:45.160]
I wasn't joking about that yesterday because I'm certainly not gonna freeze my ass in Toronto all winter long

[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:46.880]
But where would be a good alternative?

[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:48.820]
Where the weather is like mild you know

[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.360]
Stewart for the winter?

[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:53.520]
Yeah like the middle of November to like the first of March

[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:55.080]
Texas

[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:57.760]
Albuquerque

[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.460]
How about Louisiana?

[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:04.340]
You know it gets pretty damn cold those aren't warm places either

[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:07.980]
No you got to hang down to get into the warm

[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:11.260]
Right like maybe not San Diego but like what Santa Barbara

[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:12.720]
Right?

[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:14.100]
Baja California

[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:15.580]
Baja sounds really good

[01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:16.480]
You can hang with some beer

[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.020]
Tijuana

[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.360]
I don't want it

[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:24.760]
I could be on extra X, T, R, and Tijuana that would be good then I could say F and S, H and all other stuff on a year

[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:25.520]
I don't

[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.620]
I mean that fish not on this one

[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:33.000]
Probably it's after 11 at 560 WQM I'm gonna tell you about a spectacular place in fact two fine restaurants in town

[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.780]
Jeff Cohen owns in both the world famous pizza lofts in Davie and implantation

[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:46.360]
And the Broward location is on Navhill and Sunrise right behind the Walgreens

[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:51.680]
And that little strip shopping center can't see it from the street but the good news is both pizza loft locations

[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:45.280]

Wow so here's a fact oh I got two faxes to catch up on meet him real slow nil

[01:03:52.080 --> 01:04:01.740]

[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:18.980]
NIL

[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:20.540]
Yes

[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:29.620]
Because of your show and all the drafts that you play in the recommendation yes already four years old and my wife and I sat down last night and watched the first time

[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:33.840]
You watched the Godfather for the first time for the first time yeah

[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.840]
The brains will all be nice I believe suit and

[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:43.700]
Because of all the drafts that you play and I'm so used to hearing them I like that I was psychic because I knew all the lines before they even said him

[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:44.100]
It was

[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.140]
I think your brain is going to suck

[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.080]
Anyway, so how do you enjoy how did it change your life?

[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:58.460]

[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:03.600]
I don't care how many day go get any what grease ball come on come out of the wood work. They had to do it

[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.960]
I've laughed for five minutes. Yeah, that was good

[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:06.840]
Jack Waltz

[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:12.600]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I'm not sure if I could take over the program director down there

[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.920]
But I got a great way to increase numbers in that five day shift without changing anything go right ahead

[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:23.160]
You just change the name to free tickets today. Uh-huh. We'll be right back with more free tickets today

[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:29.680]
Coming up after the break free tickets today. You know what I'm saying? I think it would work. I think I think you got your finger on it

[01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:31.570]
Hey, guys. Thanks, palmy

[01:05:32.550 --> 01:05:35.150]
There's a guy saw the godfather last night thanks to me

[01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:38.890]
I don't want to talk me about a hundred years of encouragement. They finally got around with here's a

[01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:43.710]
Auschis facts. Wait to do this. It's gotta be it's gotta be a comedy facts. I hope so, but I don't think so

[01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:49.750]
Although it is on sign Neil. Hello, do you think you can invite Rimmer to your program today or tomorrow?

[01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:52.270]
Yeah, as the draft is coming up. I'd like to know his opinion

[01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:56.230]
I wouldn't also did you hear for all this morning when he said that Valbury might be coming back

[01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:59.130]
Yeah, that's what it said to big article in both sports sections and the newspapers

[01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:01.810]
What a joke that would be and you are absolutely correct

[01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:06.530]
I'm sure Rimmer would love to come on your program and talk hockey. Oh, I'm sure he would but it ain't gonna happen

[01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:13.070]
There's about as much chance that that happening is my bite him anymore meals. Here's another fact that says

[01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:20.150]
Out of the contest the hottest babies Liz gets two huge ones up, but Frank looks like an escape prisoner from little Havana

[01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:27.270]
I noticed how George and G. W. Arneck and neck and neck and today's poll know they're not and I was wondering if we could put a picture of George on your

[01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:33.070]
Sight dancing shoulder to shoulder with W. He don't want to be a scene with him and by the way one is George coming on

[01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:36.530]
I think a little ass and babe talk is in either of here says a factory in Kendall

[01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:39.230]
See this is the problem now you got it with Howard Spurmer

[01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:43.310]
You got your baby and ass talk with for well you got it up to your earlobe's baby and ass talk

[01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:46.370]
So we're gonna try to give you like as we always do something different what I'm here

[01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:52.750]
Like penis talk. It's not anything different. No, no seriously. I mean I just or talk right anything else

[01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:57.610]
Just to try to calm you down a little bit and then of course when the mad dog comes on then well

[01:06:57.610 --> 01:07:03.430]
Oh, right and what that's all about that man. Seriously. He like he made me change my underwear twice yesterday when he was in here

[01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:04.610]
Soiled me twice

[01:07:05.490 --> 01:07:10.390]
He is so ecstatic about to be it on doing two to four and also my giving him that advice

[01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:14.790]
He see that's a guy to mad dog who's not a bull crap artist. He'll thank me for what I want

[01:07:14.790 --> 01:07:17.410]
He's honest enough to admit that I'm the one that changed his life

[01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:19.450]
He said you taught me man

[01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:23.450]
He said you taught me less work and more money, which is why he's on like once a week

[01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:28.910]
Yeah, that's two hours it gets a fortune nice go on mad dog and of course Hank now it is a 15 minute show

[01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:34.790]
Yeah, he's doing the same thing that was getting paid zillions for working about 20 minutes a week

[01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:40.130]
That's the way we like it here at Q.A.N. That's why we're even nice to the underlings like our program director clearance

[01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:42.850]
How much do you think he's pulling down?

[01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:44.910]
so to speak

[01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.970]
You

[01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:50.690]
Figures plus

[01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:56.090]
And he can't get laid

[01:07:57.530 --> 01:07:59.670]
He's making six figures and he can't get laid

[01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:05.910]
What what is that? He's making three figures

[01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:11.510]
You're making and and and beta boys making three figures with a decimal in between a second and third ones

[01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:15.850]
And he can get laid and then looks like crap to top it all up. So it's got nothing to do with appearance

[01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:19.970]
Because believe me if I had to put the clearance and beanor boys side by side

[01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.990]
I wouldn't know which one to start crying about

[01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:27.170]
Which of these statements is the most ridiculous and of course both of them would say well look at yourself pal

[01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:29.150]
Hey, you'd be amazed he'll be shocked

[01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:33.410]
Which of these statements is the most ridiculous George W. Bush is a great leader 134

[01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:38.550]
George is a great fill in for Neil 60 all the way do love his ass is eating ass and sucking armpit to our shows

[01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:43.090]
Pieces coming in the middle east 41 more Howard David it does a great show of 33

[01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:47.670]
The marlins will win 91 games 19 and now we got a tie for last place

[01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:50.050]
Clarence is starting to get a little bit of respect for the audience

[01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:53.330]
See the problem with Clarence is they don't know they don't know that much about him

[01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:55.670]
Just what we say on the air. Well, they could see his picture now

[01:08:55.670 --> 01:09:00.490]
They could see his picture with the beast on the O'Rodgers.com if you want to understand what the problem is there

[01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:03.310]
Just take a look at that. Okay. Take a look at that girly body

[01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:09.730]
For all has a pleasant voice 11 votes for that and Clarence our program director will get laid this year 11 of us including me

[01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:15.210]
So that's the most ridiculous thing I've heard not only this year, but in a coons age in a very very long time

[01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:20.210]
Don't forget check out the QA van new into one today the lovely Miguel is gonna be there

[01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:17.350]
How's that happen? Sean probably is in a $300,000 house

[01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:21.330]
Like I said probably it was in a $500,000 house you could be

[01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:23.750]

Shmory around they give them the home. They suckle. They're right. They unleash them on your hood. Right

[01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:15.490]
They're being encouraged. They're being like kept in the community by homeless voice one more reason to say no

[01:11:15.490 --> 01:11:21.350]

You know exactly what the final score is gonna be you'll even know what innings the runs are gonna be scored in

I don't need to McDonald's. I don't need a burger king. I'm not interested in standing online at Disney World

[01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:30.430]
I mean, I'm just not I'm not one of those go along with the crown kind of people

[01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:33.930]
I was not a thing you know normal can't that silly a queen calls me yesterday

[01:26:33.930 --> 01:26:38.390]
Not only trying to get me to do that bobble head stupid thing that he says oh rumors are I'm here

[01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:40.610]
And you're gonna be at the frills of marlin game tonight

[01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:44.250]
Of course, it's normal was there because he goes all the time and gets free tickets and has no life

[01:26:45.330 --> 01:26:49.590]
And I said do you think that there's really any chance I said if you paid me by the pitch. I wouldn't go

[01:26:51.490 --> 01:26:53.670]
What about the get by the catch now?

[01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:55.530]
Depends on who's catching

[01:26:55.530 --> 01:27:03.410]
I would not go I would not attend I would not participate. Oh, but it's a big summer movie out now you got to see it

[01:27:05.370 --> 01:27:08.570]
The Hulk in addition which you tell me that it really absolutely blue

[01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.590]
hard

[01:27:10.150 --> 01:27:17.290]
It blew absolutely hard. It sucked and blue. It sucked and blue so hard that you almost got sucked into the screen

[01:27:17.290 --> 01:27:23.070]
It was sucked. You almost went through the goddamn movie screen and there were people screaming from the other side trying to get back out

[01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:24.970]
That's how hard it sucked sir

[01:27:26.590 --> 01:27:27.370]
WDQ I am

[01:27:28.230 --> 01:27:31.830]
Hey Neil. Yes, sir. Are you gonna continue with the

[01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:35.890]
The the contest they have the number three is over the lifestyle contest?

[01:27:36.610 --> 01:27:40.390]
Is that something you're gonna continue doing? We have one more in July and that's for right now. That's it

[01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:47.090]
Okay, uh, which works out good because then after that starting in August we get our best of the CDs in the keychains great perfect

[01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:49.610]
I don't quite understand some of the voting here, but I guess

[01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:53.210]
Well, hey listen see if I make too many comments

[01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:57.970]
It's not a good thing because then it sounds like I'm trying to like you know push people in one direction with the other

[01:27:57.970 --> 01:28:02.010]
I can't I just can't afford to do that correct the contest I guess like Richard Sherrill's pretty hot

[01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:06.710]
I guess Richard Sherrill me more friends with computers who can vote or something that I think you're starting to get warm now

[01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:12.370]
I think you're still out your thumb on it. Thank Neil good job. Have a great day. Bye. Yeah, I don't I don't know

[01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:16.170]
I mean like I said I can't say anything. I certainly have my opinions

[01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:20.530]
And I certainly have off the air have made maybe expressed one or two

[01:28:21.370 --> 01:28:23.570]
But on the air I just daston say nothing

[01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:29.390]
Frank and Liz are in first place and seven oh eight nothing wrong with them except for a very very high total there

[01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:30.910]
So you know

[01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:31.550]
What?

[01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.750]
708

[01:28:34.330 --> 01:28:37.850]
Brian and Natasha and out of dancing wrong with them. They're in second place three sixteen

[01:28:38.650 --> 01:28:39.890]
and then we get to

[01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:43.150]
Holly and Darren 208

[01:28:43.150 --> 01:28:44.850]
Mike and Kristen 207

[01:28:46.230 --> 01:28:51.850]
Uh, and then we move on to uh that big smile Mary and Shane. She's got two. I mean they got 204

[01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:54.010]
She's got two oh four

[01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:56.490]
AM and Jan 184

[01:28:58.130 --> 01:29:00.530]
Uh Greg and Stephanie 147

[01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:05.470]
Daniel Michelle. This is the one that just it puzzles me 142

[01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:10.430]
I just I can't say anything. Uh, I thought they would do a little better but I can't say anything

[01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:15.250]
Captain singing is why nice wonderful folks. We love Captain sing tremendously one oh nine

[01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:19.510]
He'd do better if he'd let his hair down if he'd let us hear it down a little bit kind of like Moe he needs to

[01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:25.790]
Vicki and Mick and I said that yesterday if it was funny yesterday it's not still funny. It's not still funny

[01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:28.450]
I mean he's tragic he's pathetic so

[01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.990]
So awful

[01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:31.930]
Vicki and Mick 96

[01:29:32.970 --> 01:29:35.330]
Yeah, you know, I wasn't gonna say this on the air

[01:29:35.690 --> 01:29:38.490]
But when Mandice was in here. I was on Monday, I guess

[01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:42.370]
That's seriously because I know we had the ballgame was on Tuesday

[01:29:42.370 --> 01:29:45.670]
And I hadn't seen him in a couple of months and of course we get along just great. We have

[01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:50.010]
high mutual respect the Mad Dog and yours truly and

[01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:54.250]
Worked together for what about 100 years now that I would be and hear all over the place. I love the Mad Dog

[01:29:54.250 --> 01:29:58.950]
So we're talking about various things and he's telling thanking me for the new schedule two to four

[01:29:58.950 --> 01:30:04.150]
He loves it and thanking me for like giving him the good advice less work and more pay and the audio idea

[01:30:04.150 --> 01:30:08.130]
And so we got conversation eventually evolved to Moe

[01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:13.690]
And I said the same thing to him that I had I guess it was fresh in my mind because I just said it to you on the air about

[01:30:14.090 --> 01:30:18.230]
There's a part of Moe that you would that you see it very infrequently unfortunately

[01:30:18.730 --> 01:30:22.110]
And there's that little humorous that twinkle in the eye that little sensey humor

[01:30:22.570 --> 01:30:24.050]
That you really want to like

[01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:27.930]
Right and Mad Dog looked at me like he didn't say it

[01:30:27.930 --> 01:30:31.770]
But the message from his eyes was well, I haven't found it yet. Yeah

[01:30:31.770 --> 01:30:35.110]
I think I know where it is and why we never see it

[01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:36.190]
Oh no

[01:30:38.130 --> 01:30:41.270]
It's in the bag though. It's on top of his head. Oh come on

[01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:45.730]
I'm serious. I'm not saying that gratuitously. I mean it's far too late to be saying that

[01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:49.810]
I don't think Moe and I are gonna be that tight. It's time to get it on well

[01:30:49.810 --> 01:30:54.690]
They already are on that website. I mean we're getting it on heavy duty and I give him a high marks for energy

[01:30:55.250 --> 01:31:00.310]
He just keeps swinging that thing man old man. He's like the energizer bunny staying power

[01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:02.570]
Dan and Sherry have 47 votes

[01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:06.270]
Rich and Cheryl have 38. She's got an enormous pair

[01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:11.010]
And Jody and Kevin 24 in last place. They must be a very bad, but I'll say to you

[01:31:11.010 --> 01:31:13.130]
I'm sure it's the photo that's Cepia

[01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:17.390]
It kind of seep on it's kind of seeping negative weirdness

[01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:22.230]
Yeah, it's just not a good camera 24 votes because the audience 2430 votes now

[01:31:22.230 --> 01:31:25.910]
What do we wind up on the last contest 29 or something then change 29.53

[01:31:26.370 --> 01:31:31.110]
Yeah, today's Thursday now we started out to think with about 1413 something the first day right

[01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:34.330]
So it's increasing gradually, but keep in mind people can only vote

[01:31:37.390 --> 01:31:37.750]
Yeah

[01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:38.830]
Yeah, finish it. Come on

[01:31:40.190 --> 01:31:40.550]
rarely

[01:31:41.970 --> 01:31:47.090]
Well, no, the point I'm trying to make is that we're no matter how many hits we get on the website and lately has been phenomenal

[01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:52.370]
There are only a limited number of people who can vote it's that a well crap again people can only vote at a certain rate

[01:31:52.370 --> 01:32:01.090]
I don't want why why are you doing this to me? What what have I done? You know, what why do you do this? It's a contest

[01:32:01.090 --> 01:32:04.770]
You can't do that, but then again, what do you know right not much

[01:32:05.490 --> 01:32:10.430]
Clarites is by the way he wants to thank me for the tremendous publicity and hopefully there will be a line of beautiful babes

[01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:15.330]
hanging outside the door as soon as he gets done with work this afternoon some of those girls from the marlins last night

[01:32:17.150 --> 01:32:18.510]
Yeah, were they that desperate

[01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:25.730]
Some of the skanky ones with the banana under-ass that for all was talking about this morning with the bruises on her head and on their body parts

[01:32:25.730 --> 01:32:28.170]
Yeah, then they might do clearance like in the dark

[01:32:29.450 --> 01:32:30.070]
Come on

[01:32:31.090 --> 01:32:35.790]
5 6 7 0 5 oh the moosey man is resigning you just see that no and you want to know why he's resigning

[01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:39.390]
see the controversy over Charlie moose

[01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:41.950]
Who you remember I'm sure very very well

[01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:48.170]
Of course was the fact that he had all kinds of offers for movie deals and book deals and his employer said

[01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:49.670]
No, we don't think so

[01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:56.330]
You can't be a consultant on a movie about the sniper case the county employee may not profit on the side from his official duties

[01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:58.130]
And so he's basically saying okay

[01:32:58.130 --> 01:33:04.170]
Well, how about not on the side? How about if I leave here? Yeah, and then I'll go out. I mean he's not really saying that but we know exactly what that's gonna be

[01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:06.990]
He's gonna write a book

[01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:13.950]
Write a book about those lunatics or scumbags in the bad news is those two bastards. They're still alive. That's the bad news

[01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:19.010]
See that's a miracle for if we had real justice those two already be pushing up daisies

[01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:21.430]
They be taking a long dirt and add those that pair of scumbags

[01:33:22.230 --> 01:33:25.170]
But not an american man. We got to drag that thing out

[01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:31.270]
And they'll probably get off you know with like a slap on a wrist as opposed to those guys in tulya, Texas

[01:33:32.650 --> 01:33:35.990]
Who work and that the one guy how's that how old's that one guy like 60?

[01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:43.970]
Eight or so what is he an old guy right ancient ancient guy and he cooled his heels in there for four or five years before they finally let his ass out

[01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:48.230]
Sad just try that's the american fn way man. That's justice

[01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:50.490]
Come into q.a.m

[01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:51.870]
Hello, yes, sir

[01:33:55.890 --> 01:34:01.310]
Getting restless. We're gonna do with them. Well, what would we gonna do with them? Well, it's a bit there

[01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:03.450]
You know reminds me of it's like arthamic doffee all over again

[01:34:03.450 --> 01:34:09.350]
That's what it's like to me got with on a motorcycle got chased and the one of getting killed sounds a lot like arthamic doffee and tamper to me

[01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:15.470]
There you go and there's also been some ripple effects and they say emberling tin Vermont. I didn't think the wishmasters in Vermont

[01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:17.230]
one and two

[01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:19.690]
one or two

[01:34:20.650 --> 01:34:25.470]
Click and you know how he said it real fact at the end right before we put the phone back down that always a president only manager

[01:34:26.710 --> 01:34:28.090]
Very good very effective sir

[01:34:29.310 --> 01:34:33.710]
There are only two shfarts as in brubble. They're not there right now as a matter of fact. They're both on a way down to get you now

[01:34:34.730 --> 01:34:36.450]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:40.930]
pound 5 60 on the 18 t and Verizon wireless line w.k.y.m

[01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:42.450]
Hey, yes, sir

[01:34:42.450 --> 01:34:49.350]
I don't want to using any bad information the technical term what what do you mean you don't want me using any bad information

[01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:55.790]
What does that mean the technical term for a phobia? It's not a phobia that color thought he knew so much. It's a do it

[01:34:57.710 --> 01:35:02.250]
Yeah, that's what it's called. I don't want me to that color. We had like 6,000 people all said cp

[01:35:02.250 --> 01:35:10.070]
No, it's not it's a do it tone two colors anyway. Well, what what who is like black and blue do it on and so any two colors

[01:35:10.850 --> 01:35:15.070]
Right exactly. Okay, cp and well, we shouldn't want to be given no bad information

[01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:19.490]
You have any idea what do you remember when they were doing that on the NFL? Yes, I did it was terrible

[01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:26.450]
It didn't work a couple of months ago a couple of months ago you had a caller around the time the space shuttle crash

[01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:32.770]
He really bothered me. He mentioned some Bob a booey goo for Dan rather. I know who this guy is Steve Rubin

[01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:35.130]
Stop stop calling Neil and

[01:35:35.130 --> 01:35:42.290]
You know start paying people on the job. Let me if you hear this. I know you're a chronic if it gets okay

[01:35:43.150 --> 01:35:50.530]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T. What are you looking at your watch? Oh, I'm just waiting

[01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:54.250]
Waiting for what to a clown. Yeah

[01:35:54.250 --> 01:36:01.870]
Oh, you thought I waited too long was that the thing? No, no, I think I timed it out. Okay, and if not that's okay too

[01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:05.310]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60

[01:36:06.210 --> 01:36:12.230]
On the AT&T and Verizon wireless line don't forget Miguel is out there giving away Marlon tickets any takers out there

[01:36:12.230 --> 01:36:17.130]
No, I think it would be great if we had some good sports who would take these tickets from last night's game

[01:36:17.130 --> 01:36:22.550]
They could keep us a souvenir. They might be worth something someday where the real the only thing is you will have to drive down here to get them

[01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:27.090]
And then you'll have to service clearance in before we didn't before you get the tickets

[01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:33.690]
You way up

[01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:39.890]
This mark Morgan is the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M

[01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:51.330]
Got an inside Wall Street 10

[01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:54.750]
How she's gonna pay for it

[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:59.820]
Prober says she lied just soon be

[01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:00.980]
Time

[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:08.820]
That's

[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:20.200]
You're up in the stripes send her to sing sing put her in for life

[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.400]
That would be a good thing

[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:24.480]
Oh

[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:35.320]
Is

[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:35.320]

[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:35.320]

[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:41.900]
At all

[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.440]
Your

[01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:56.440]
It's still doing this with your sound.

[01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:04.920]
Combo 1-560 WQM is kind of ashamed that Muff had to take a reduction in pace so that

[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.160]
clearance could be making six figures and still can't get laid.

[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:09.940]
Not that we've regurged our clearance anything. You know, he's a good guy.

[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:11.800]
But don't you think that's unfortunate?

[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:16.140]
Don't be like them coming in saying, hey George, we'd like you. You've been here a long time now.

[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:18.720]
You're doing a fine job. You don't cause too many problems anymore.

[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:22.480]
But we're cutting your pay in half because Bina Boy's got to get paid.

[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:27.540]
Well, it kind of worked out that way anyway since he's not getting paid. I have to subsidize it.

[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:30.100]
Oh, okay. So in other words, it came with like a behind the ass deal.

[01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:34.420]
Right. We're schmoozing and losing, man. Mostly losing here these two days today and tomorrow.

[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:36.720]
That's the way I wanted it. I thought it was going to be just...

[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:40.260]
And it has. It has. It has looked up to every expectation I had.

[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:42.240]
It's been exactly what I thought.

[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:47.060]
5-6-7. Right. You can smell it.

[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:48.400]
I could feel it. Yeah.

[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:55.520]
Which of these statements is the most ridiculous is our question on neo-roger.com that they were going to spectacular response on a poll.

[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:57.380]
469.

[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:01.300]
George W. Bush is a great leader. 200 people say that's ridiculous.

[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:05.720]
George is a great fill in for neo. 83 people see that's even more ridiculous.

[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:09.420]
Peace is coming in the Middle East, although we didn't say peace of what. Maybe peace of a halva.

[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:10.960]
Peace of pie.

[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.340]
Nice to have a kind of pie.

[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:17.760]
No. Maybe not. Definitely not. Definitely not pecan pie.

[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:20.540]
Jews don't eat pecan pie. Well, they are.

[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.380]
That's a southern U.S. thing.

[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:26.020]
It's good. If done right. It's very rich. Oh, yeah.

[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:27.680]
It's it's fat rich.

[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:32.240]
Peace is coming in the Middle East. 68 said that's ridiculous. And of course they're right.

[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:36.720]
A lot of you are right. Moe Howard David, it does a great show. 56 said that's ridiculous.

[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:40.820]
The most. The Marlins win 91 games. 30 people said that's ridiculous.

[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:44.040]
A lot more. What has said that except most people don't care which we found out yesterday.

[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:46.860]
Paral's got a pleasant voice. 18 said that's ridiculous.

[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:51.120]
And Clarets, our program director, will get laid this year. 14 including me.

[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:54.760]
See, generally the vote I cast is usually the number one choice.

[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:58.820]
Because I'm big while I guess because I'm the one who designs the poll.

[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:02.100]
You know, if you're going to if you're going to design a quiz like for school,

[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:03.600]
you should know what the right answers are. Right.

[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:09.040]
Usually a pretty good idea. Only 14 said Clarets will get laid this year as a ridiculous concept,

[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:15.600]
which obviously means they have never met him. 5 6 7 0 5 60 and hurt his tails of woe.

[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:16.940]
Pound 5 60 on the.

[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:22.040]
Is sales of whoa. He doesn't say the same way that Eric does.

[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:24.640]
Nobody can say quite like him. Eric by the way has a lovely wife.

[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:28.820]
Although that doesn't necessarily prove well. WD Q a M.

[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:32.560]
And he is I'm talking about now currently WD Q a M.

[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:37.860]
Hey, knew I wanted to know when does Scott's real numbers come off for the first time.

[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:42.000]
Well, the first trend will not be until July because coming out at the end of June,

[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:45.380]
that'll be a main number. He wasn't on the air. He was always a month behind.

[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:48.900]
So at the end of July about the 27th of July, you'll have the June numbers,

[01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:58.800]
which will be a full month of for real. So July and also would at one age,

[01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:04.140]
you got what you wanted. What is that July? 24 July 24th,

[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:07.540]
mark it down in your counter. That'll be the first time we get those for all numbers.

[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:10.460]
And of course by then he may have moved in our most territory.

[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:14.260]
I'm going to kick his ass and then I'll steal his two pay and dance. That's a book.

[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.580]
So we'll get to break it down.

[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:22.840]
Yeah, we're going to have a breakdown. I'm working on my okay.

[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.340]
I'm having one here now. It's okay. It's just fine. This is just like I said,

[01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:30.960]
exactly what I anticipated. But I like it because I mean, I don't, I just, I don't know,

[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.860]
I just feel that these people should do a little more of their part, which they don't do.

[01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:36.980]
There are too, too many takers in this time. That's one of the reasons it's so unacceptable.

[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.660]
Too many takers. You don't want to give anything. Well, wow, then you're gay.

[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:44.220]
I'm not talking about it. See, everything always comes back to sex.

[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:47.420]
Is that all, all you know about is sex? I mean, that's all I think about.

[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:51.000]
I think about it. I'll you, they'll illustrate people. I'll tell you somebody in this building,

[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.860]
who I'm really a, not a maze because I've seen it since he's out. We've been here.

[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:58.120]
Poor Adam and sales. Now Adam is, you know, you're thinking why get laid once in a while.

[01:41:58.340 --> 01:42:02.220]
He does. Yeah. He gives you the impression he doesn't.

[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:05.600]
No, but he just gives me the impression that he is so absolutely desperate.

[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.100]
Oh my God, she had the most unbelievable hooters.

[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:13.100]
Yeah, I mean, he just stands in there in the morning and just, maybe he just suck it up to you.

[01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:18.420]
Maybe he's doing it for that reason. Maybe he does fine or, or maybe he's trying to like,

[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:23.020]
in a very sly way because he's a low-key kind of a guy. Maybe he's trying to give you like a little,

[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:26.620]
a little zet. All that could be that that could be. He knows you're not getting any.

[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:28.840]
Right. He does find Adam. Yeah.

[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:33.500]
Because he certainly gives me a print. So maybe you're assuming the same logic.

[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:41.100]
It maybe, maybe Clarence does find to, although quite honestly, I've never heard Clarence going on and on about some hot young babe with,

[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:47.200]
with beautiful melons and with the, you know, all the others. In fact, for Al was telling yesterday that I had the most beautiful vagina

[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:49.340]
that he's ever seen in his life. You hear that? Right.

[01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:52.940]
And his mind of you. Right. He's been around a couple.

[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:56.960]
Clarence on the other hand. It's a little red though.

[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:02.560]
Kaboos. WQ-I-M.

[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:04.020]
You know how you doing?

[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:06.400]
Talking about that funky meat at the Kaboos again. Yes, sir.

[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:12.860]
I got a two thing that I want to tell you. One, I think you should put the gildy and moe picture on the hot couple's contest.

[01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:15.340]
That might win.

[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:21.200]
And also do you see more US troops got shot in Iraq by the ambush?

[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:27.540]
Yes, they did. Yeah. We need to pull them out. And a shameless request. Steve Phillips got fired. Can you play the, you know, Steve Phillips?

[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:30.180]
Steve Phillips. Yes, for the Met with.

[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:35.500]
Spousal. Yeah. No, not Spousal or Rosal. All the Mickey Mouse stuff. Okay. Thank you.

[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:36.980]
Spousal or Rosal.

[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:41.480]
Somebody getting fired in there too. Oh God.

[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:49.120]
5670560.560 on the AT&T. And Verizon wireless line.

[01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:54.860]
Got these tickets for last night's Met's game. Let's see. We did the moosey man talked about the refrigerator.

[01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:00.300]
Dumb as a box of rocks. That was a great line, mad dog. A Robert's cheer. I got a great column here. It's on our website though.

[01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:04.260]
What did he know? One day he know it. See, I don't want to read these. Carrie leads Dean and pull a new Hampshire.

[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:11.840]
John Kerry. It's kind of scary, but I think John Kerry, which he was the original one I like poor Bob Graham and it just makes me sad.

[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:18.360]
The latest pull in New Hampshire. Carrie's got 28% Howard Dean's got 18%.

[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:25.980]
Where's the rest? 23% undecided.

[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:38.920]
Jew Lieberman was at 11% and Dick Gebhardt of Missouri was 10%. Of course, keep in mind that's in the New England, which Carrie and Dean and Lieberman all are from New England.

[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:48.440]
Dick Gebhardt, 10%. John Edwards of North Carolina, who's just as terminal as they come, 4%. And Bobby Graham's got only 2%.

[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:54.700]
Carol Mosley Brown represented Dennis Kucinich with that bad hair piece, but a good mouth. And El Sharpe and each had 1%.

[01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:59.700]
As was retired Army General Wesley Clark, who was not announced yet, but everybody's awaiting on the edge of their seat.

[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:11.460]
So that's the latest from New Hampshire. As the Democrats continue trying to find somebody who can run and not beat themselves because I have a feeling that anybody just about anybody's going to win in 2004 and it won't be W.

[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:14.120]
I really believe that now. Even Joe.

[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:21.680]
Like I said, no, look at that. The doubt what's happening there? We are on that big run that I was down 110 point.

[01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:27.540]
Nasdaq's down about 18 and a half. We're just taking a little pause now. Okay. Maybe the market's a little bit overbought.

[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:36.500]
You know what expression? Overbought. And maybe the short sellers are sticking up their butt and maybe the long sellers are sideways and busted and.

[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:40.660]
Huh? The bears are fighting with the bull. The bears are fighting with a bullshmit and all the other bullcrap.

[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:51.000]
Okay. And maybe just maybe they're looking for a what do they call it? A rush to flight to safe. Oh, that's it. That's not one that's stupidly shays.

[01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:59.680]
Flight to safety. In other words, all these equities you're buying is crap. It's speculative. It's like gambling without the fun. A flight to safety.

[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:11.720]
Well, I'll tell you what a scam. I wish I never would have heard that word stock market. Then words. I wish I never would have heard of it. That day Rick Riley. See what he did. Yeah, he did. He's a wanted plan to the seed. He planted the bad seed.

[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:18.260]
If it wouldn't have been for him and certain other people, I wouldn't be here right now. Be your show. You and be in a boy. Be doing the show.

[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:26.860]
What are you sorry like that? You'd be doing the show. Yeah, permanent. Sorry. I'm not.

[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:41.360]
Well, sorry, you lost all that money. I'm not. It's criminal. You believe me? Yeah, my girl. I know. I would have to be here sitting begging pleading for somebody to speak to actually had something to say something on their mind. Something friendly. Something intelligent. Something worthwhile.

[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:46.500]
Something useful. Something exciting. Something meaningful besides. Well, did you see she had a big hero.

[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:56.620]
Adam, you're a good guy. Okay, but I'm going to file a sex discrimination suit because I have to be one old bag who's getting really sick and tired of all your heterosexuals flaunting your sexuality in front of us.

[01:46:56.620 --> 01:47:06.060]
Okay, we're sick and tired. All you go straight guys in here holding hands kissing in public kissing and doing these things. That's right. Spooning spooning and of course with each other.

[01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:08.960]
That's the thing that I find disgusting beast.

[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:17.080]
Wasn't that like redundant. The stuff that movie yet. Disgusting beast. What movie disgusting? I mean sexy beast.

[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:21.940]
And then since Toronto I can't see it here. I mean, you think I'm buying another copy of that. You got to be crazy.

[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:27.720]
I'm waiting for my report. I will say this. I don't know. I don't want to like but best buy which I used to love them.

[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:32.040]
And then of course you got to the point where you couldn't get service in there. It's basically when you're buying a computer.

[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:41.200]
Anything that's on a top shelf. Right. Good luck to you. Forget about it. You'll never live long enough to get it. But if you're buying like DVDs, they got a pretty good selection.

[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:49.540]
And they got good deals CDs CDs. They got very good. And then you can take right to the counter and unless you get one certain cashier which he's got a high club.

[01:47:50.220 --> 01:48:00.100]
Oh, I mean she is. I don't want to. In fact, somebody one of my listeners was there in that line of front of me last night.

[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:04.580]
So I hope he's listening right now. Very nice gentleman in the sun. Hope he's listening right now because he knows exactly what I'm talking about.

[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:09.300]
She was never then sawdust. I like the best buys in other towns. Don't have the kinds of problems we do.

[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:13.020]
What do you mean by that? Because you know everything here. The service here sucks.

[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:24.860]
11 past noon at 560 WQM. How low can those interest rates go? That's a question so many people might be pondering right now while the financial group right at the moment is doing the limbo under the lowest B finance rate you've ever heard of.

Right and local. Here's sports video 560. She went UAM.

[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:35.420]
To a voting booth near you Arnold Schwarzenegger is the candidate or yeah now a really under running man.

[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:41.380]
Ha ha. He's a deadly political machine sent from the future to terminate the governor of present day California.

[01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:52.100]
As the levista great Davis Arnold Schwarzenegger is the candidate. I think that all of the state officials should be totally recalled.

[01:49:53.780 --> 01:50:01.840]
Arnold Schwarzenegger has what it takes to succeed in politics. If you go into tell lies make sure that they're true lies.

[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:10.500]
He's the last political action hero. He is Arnold Schwarzenegger the candidate. Hold for me if you want to live.

[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.640]
Hey boy by a string of cliched action films and a little bit of Kennedy money.

[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:19.240]
Oh look at us. Here's the big nose Martha Stewart's trial set for January 12th. I say Friday bitch.

[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:27.520]
I'm so sick and tired of all these people. She's been made an example of and it's because she's a woman and because she's famous. Okay fine now friar.

[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:33.100]
Okay. Yeah. I'm not going to argue with you. Let's just friar ass just to make an example out of her like I said.

[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:43.700]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound. It's like one owner rider. Same thing. Right 20 years. No questions asked. Yeah, but she forgot. Yes, she forgot. Yes, sure she did.

[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:53.680]
All the all the shleppers out there. All the poor people. The hundredlings the hundred dog friends of Joe Rose. All those poor bastards work their asses off for two three bucks an hour. Right.

[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.540]
Try for years to save a few bucks and then bush came along and all their money went up like in flames.

[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:02.680]
And those bastards have to sit back and watch his people like when owner rider out there shoplifting.

[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:06.920]
All these other great Martha Stewart ripping off the public.

[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:16.760]
Cranjick. It's enough to make you want to be like dishonest. I mean you work at the station. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60.

[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:23.400]
If you think this honesty. Oh, you know what I heard about Gildi with that $10. Did you hear that story? Do you hear it? The meaner boy $10. What?

[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:28.180]
He was at the mobile station. I'm assuming I'm not for sure, but the one up on county line in 441.

[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:32.460]
And he got gas or whatever he bought and he gave the guy $20 bill.

[01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:42.340]
And he spent like 17 bucks or something. Right. And the guy gave him a two 68 or a 10. He gave him another. It's $10 too much change.

[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:49.940]
And Gildi being the prick that he is walks away with the extra money. Now he's asking he's debating on the year with mode this morning.

[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:54.800]
And the callers should he go back there and give him the 10 bucks back. Now here's a guy with a squeaky voice.

[01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:59.320]
This little punk Gildi who I don't know what he's making, but I'm at six figures for sure. Okay. Yeah.

[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:05.320]
And believe me a lot more than that voice ever in a history mankind should make an is witness anyway.

[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:12.860]
And he's screwing some guy and they finally they are the callers embarrassed him. He's going to go back. I'd be humiliated and embarrassed to go back.

[01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:20.140]
Now many years ago I was at a gas station. I mean I was working. I had no money. Basically I was a slipper like you. Right.

[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:29.860]
Like I'm not talking to you. I mean, beener. Oh. I mean, I'm at a gas station. It was one of those trips and driving up north or whatever and through the carolinas of Virginia. So I'm at a gas station.

[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:38.020]
And I gave the guy a 20 for like $15 worth of gas or 10 bucks, whatever. And he gave me back the right change plus a 20.

[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:51.320]
Yeah. I kept the 20. Yeah. It was dishonest. I've talked about it since then. It was dishonest and I needed the money. And it's still eating you up. No. Absolutely not.

[01:52:52.300 --> 01:53:00.340]
Absolutely not. If he was dumb enough that he couldn't make change. I mean, if I give him a 20 gives me 20 plus more back. I mean, how stupid he got to be than that.

[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:08.220]
But in recent years I've had that happen because now I would be forget about the money I'm making because I make a lot more money than guilty. Thank God.

[01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:17.340]
But if I was making the money he's making and then he went out about what the guys some Hispanic guy barely speaks English and he obviously is working for a couple of bucks an hour. Oh, in that case.

[01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:27.780]
No, but seriously. I would be so humiliated and embarrassed because he obviously was well aware that the guy gave him too much change. He like it fired because his drawers.

[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:39.340]
I've had told us if the track of me too much into oh wait a minute, you give me too much. I had that happen to me many times. Even when I was a slut. And I do know that it comes out of their pocket at the end of the night that they have to like, you know, right.

[01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:44.360]
I'll be counting on you out of their ass out of the rest. Take it out of there. They take it right out of their ass.

[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:59.380]
So guilty. I'm going to tell you something man up until today. I thought that maybe there was something redeeming in your little slimy body. But I I just can't believe that. I like I said I admit many a long time ago. I was a young punk didn't have two nickels to rub together.

[01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:08.860]
And I can't. It was a kid. It looked pretty good too. By the way. Now that's many years ago. I still remember. Does that tell you a lot of actually even our friend Adam would have thought he was pretty.

[01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:22.720]
Well, no, maybe not. Now seriously, he just you're Adam your little overboard. Save it till next week when I'm gone. Okay. I can't I can't handle it. Oh man. I mean when somebody carries on like that. It just leaves you with the impression that they're so God then desperate. Okay.

[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:37.480]
And I know you're saying he's not. I believe you that. You know, he's fine. More power. He's gonna go reason to lie. It doesn't happen for me. But it's just I don't know. So over the top. Maybe he's trying to have since for all God here. Maybe he's just like taking it up a couple of notches. I think everybody is. Yeah.

[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:54.660]
Because he's just a little over the top. You know, I'm talking about when all that bean stuff. He's been eating the bean for hours. And actually we're talking about being her boy. That's his nickname. 5 6 7. That's what he calls him. He calls him the bean.

[01:54:55.460 --> 01:55:07.140]
He got a boner boy. That's what mo calls him and for all calls him the bean. He was eating the bean. Bones the bean. And he was saying bone in the bean. I see now there you go again.

[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:21.780]
Taken the absolute truth. And I'm giving to the audience. And now you're stretching it. You're stretching it. You're really pushing it. God. This place is becoming so vulgar and dirty since for all God here. And all we have to say about that is. Yeah. We like that. We like filthy and dirty.

[01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:51.580]
That was wrong with that. Takes the heat off of us. Thanks a lot Scott. No, certainly he takes the heat off of us. Yeah. Big time. Nobody's going to be complaining about this. You anymore. This is like a grandma Moses, especially after last night. Like little red riding hood. Yes, especially after that orgy they had at the ballpark last night. After a little bean, little bean got laid there last night. It's a good thing nobody was there. See it. At least he thought it got laid. WQ I am. I know. Yes, sir. I have to thank you for turning me on the fish food. I just try it the other day.

[01:55:51.580 --> 01:56:03.220]
Yeah, well, you're sure slow starter. I haven't talked about that in a coons age. I know. I was working in a house and I had a girl. People moved me left a brand new tin brand new carton of it in the freezer.

[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:21.400]
What kind of assholes could those people have been? You leave a nice new Ben and Jerry's a virgin fish food in the freezer. You got to be an idiot. Well, now that they left it for me. Okay, well, I was nice. Anyway, gelbie sounds like a four foot nothing punk trying to sound like a tough guy. Okay. Thanks. Yeah, what do you people think about that? I mean, I know they discussed it.

[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:34.180]
But I don't want to. Of course, we've talked about that before. It's an old thing. In fact, that's what was going through my mind as I was driving in. Gee, that topic is older than the thosla. Oh, and speaking of a little known facts, you know, that when muff went for all of those tests and for that call andoscopy.

[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:46.580]
And they took those inner pictures of his. They found today. That's why I had to go back to second time. They found some unusual things in there. There were moose and Clark moose tracks. Speaking of the moosey man, moose tracks.

[01:56:47.260 --> 01:56:52.780]
5 6 7 0 5 60 train tracks. Pound 5 60. I've been working on the railroad.

[01:56:53.600 --> 01:57:00.800]
Pound 5 60 on the 18. Oh, what a beautiful day. It really is. Oh, and I haven't played that Mickey Mouse thing yet. I'll get around to it.

[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:10.700]
I'm just I'm just so you for it because it's like the latter end of the week and I know we're getting a hell out of here. Oh, I don't want to overdo it because I know that some people in the audience think that I overdo that.

[01:57:10.700 --> 01:57:16.060]
And then if I don't like it here, why the hell do I get out and I will I will very soon, but it's just it's just so.

[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:24.640]
I mean, I please point out to be the nice things, you know. Right now I'm talking about right now at this time of the year. What's the nice stuff?

[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:37.480]
What's the good part of asking to deliver? Yeah. Speaking of pizza delivery, you know, I don't want to say that Americans are fat or like all over the world. Not people are getting fat or in fact.

[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:47.220]
I'm not a better to make people mine, but Domino is it Domino's or is it no it's pizza Hut? Well, correct me, whichever one it is where they do delivery and then they give you the cinnamon rolls.

[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:56.340]
They both do that to an extent, but stop and think about that. That's like saying, would you like a few potatoes with your pasta? Right.

[01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:03.580]
Cinnamon rolls with pizza, both of them have cheese sticks and synestics of some variation or another.

[01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:10.260]
Oh my God. Talk about a carbohydrate shock. It's just pizza dough. Talk about a bunch of her spastic attack.

[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:17.180]
My God. How do you like some dough with your dough? If your cheese covered bread wasn't good enough, how about some sugar covered bread?

[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:23.060]
How do you like to have some cherry garcia with your fish food? Oh, that sounds good. Yeah, it does.

[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:29.560]
We got some cherry garcia the other day and then mixed it with like what's the other what's that other Ben and Jerry's wannabe?

[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:38.800]
It's an 80s dream. I'm going to something cut a swear of my wife's dream dream something. But anyway, they got like a real super chocolate.

[01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:42.820]
It's got like chocolate chunks and all kinds of different kinds of chocolate and you mix that together.

[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:47.980]
You you you you mush them up into microwave soften them up and you're together to cherry garcia and that stuff.

[01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:56.680]
And wow. Oh. That's that's why that's why I wish I had for else metabolism man. I could eat.

[01:58:56.680 --> 01:59:02.180]
I could just shovel down all the stuff that I love and and every skinny is a real like he is. I wouldn't be having no diabetes.

[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:07.480]
He didn't finish his food. Oh, damn it. See what you've done clearance to our good friend for Ralph.

[01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:13.600]
You're going to kill that man forcing him to eat in here and he'll the diner in drugs. That's bad.

[01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:19.220]
I feel I feel bad for him because I see the audience doesn't see this. They probably think I'm exaggerating, but it's the truth.

[01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:24.000]
The guy comes in here in the morning on every one of his commercial breaks and he's got the stuff from how he's here.

[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:31.360]
And of course he and he does get a lot of food. He gets like a bagel with the cream cheese and locks or whatever else on it.

[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:34.180]
And then he gets like a whole order of French toast egg bacon and cheese bagel.

[01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:37.940]
Yeah. And a huge order of French toast and then a bunch of bacon.

[01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:42.640]
And he drinks the syrup right out of the little. He's such the syrup right out of those little packets.

[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:47.980]
He's sucking it right out of the packet. And he's bouncing off the wall. And so it's a great.

[01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:52.600]
It's a funny act to watch, but I feel bad for him because he being forced to do the it's not good for you.

[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:58.660]
When you eat when you're under stress and eat like a big hurry like that, like a snake to binge like that. Right.

[01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:02.780]
So clearance and I let you back. I think it's time you butched up a little bit sweetheart.

[02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:07.560]
In fact, it seems to me that there is the guy if he played his cards right there could get his ass great now.

[02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:11.580]
So to speak there is the guy could clearance late is a for all.

[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:18.860]
But he's certainly not going to do it if you're like playing fast and loose with all these crazy ass rules and all these prohibitions and you can't do this and you can't you know.

[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:24.480]
So maybe clearance will take that little plunger in at the ant repellent bear nine.

[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:26.060]
Yeah, it might not have come from him.

[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:31.660]
Well, that's right. He's a straw boss anyway, which we have so many man probably came from Greg.

[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:41.120]
That probably came from Greg because clearance don't control the first rings anyway as punishment for the other people bitching about the ants or whoever did bitch about the ants besides Hank.

[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:43.980]
Yeah. Well, if you guys would meet in there, we wouldn't have ants in there.

[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:49.060]
So they're for bugs and not just ants but flying stuff. There's all kinds of bugs in here because they don't have an exterminator.

[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:55.560]
It's the only place I've ever worked of any kind in my life where they're too cheap to like once a month even more once every three months have a freaking exterminator.

[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:59.140]
And if any place that needs an exterminator, this is the place believe me.

[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:02.700]
We have lots of things in this place ought to be exterminated immediately.

[02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:06.300]
Some of them a little older than others.

[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:12.100]
27 past noon at 560 WQM. We got the mad dog coming up at 2.

[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:18.540]
The mad dog who's still searching for that fine part of Mo that we really all love and would like to final and covet.

[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:20.000]
Mad dog still hasn't found yet.

[02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:23.120]
I tell you we all have found at Brandys what to love and covet.

[02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:36.460]

Okay 1232 at 5.

[02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:41.560]
I don't have a bit to play because I already just played that one.

[02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:43.180]
What?

[02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:44.180]
Yeah.

[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:45.960]
Well, I'm sitting here daydreaming.

[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:47.500]
Don't you understand? I'm daydreaming.

[02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:48.140]
Do it all the time.

[02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:50.080]
Paying too much attention to this crap.

[02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:52.780]
I mean, here's an excellent thing from Robert and Plantation.

[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:54.500]
A great fact. It says, I'm way to work the other day.

[02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:55.620]
Some guy was passing these out.

[02:02:55.940 --> 02:02:57.040]
Thought it might be of interest to you.

[02:02:57.100 --> 02:02:58.240]
Thank you, Robert. It is good.

[02:02:58.780 --> 02:02:59.440]
Have you seen these?

[02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:01.000]
A declaration? Yadi, yadi, yadi.

[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:01.420]
No, I've done.

[02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:03.100]
Well, you like this. Long, Val, read it anyway.

[02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:03.300]
Please.

[02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:03.900]
Till some good time.

[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:04.960]
Well, be as good as these call.

[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:05.980]
What is?

[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:09.900]
A declaration for the future of America challenged for George W. Bush.

[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:14.000]
When in the course of a national crisis it becomes necessary for people to confront a long

[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.400]
train of abuses and use of patients by a president, defeated by popular vote in the 2000 election,

[02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:22.140]
now decimating American progress, his damage to liberties and rights must be announced.

[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:26.240]
The principles that should direct America's future in order to advance the safety and happiness

[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:28.860]
of our citizens must be defined for the electorate in 2004.

[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:33.580]
George W. Bush has widened the gap in income and savings between the rich and the poor,

[02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:37.720]
rewarded his financial supporters and got wood government contracts, barely converted

[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:41.480]
the decline in U.S. jobs, and consistently favor the rich and tax policies.

[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:45.040]
He has embarked on destroying civil liberties guaranteed under the First Amendment, among

[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:48.260]
them the right of privacy and the Roe v. Waitas' syndrome, which the prophecy of women

[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:48.540]
demands.

[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:52.100]
He has repeatedly nominated ultra-conservative federal judges.

[02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:56.720]
He has launched a preemptive war against Iraq, damaged the United Nations in the process,

[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:00.560]
made enemies of France, Germany and other former allies, particularly Arab nations.

[02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:04.460]
He's brought about deaths of more than 100 U.S. troops and uncounted Iraqi civilians for

[02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:08.080]
the ostensible reason to find the instruments of mass destruction still unproved, and

[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:11.860]
reality hems to control Iraq's oil and the stamp U.S. hidden Germany everywhere concentrating

[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:13.160]
now on Syria and Iran.

[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:17.640]
He has settled the U.S. with the huge cost of policing Iraq at the same time he widows

[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:22.000]
away at such basic domestic needs as social security and Medicare, holding these truths

[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.180]
to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal and endowed with the innelable

[02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:28.260]
rights of life-liberating the pursuit of happiness we've prepared therefore to clear

[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:30.640]
these principles to be the basis of America's future.

[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:34.440]
We want our country to be based once again on the objectives of the founding fathers,

[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:38.560]
the America of Jefferson Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Homer Simpson too, I guess.

[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.500]
We want a country where separation and church and state is absolute, where no religion or

[02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:45.820]
group can impose its opinions on all others, where school boards and public institutions

[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:49.680]
are free from control by a few, where religions receive no government money to advance their

[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:50.060]
positions.

[02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:54.360]
We want an America dedicated to shrinking the gap between Rich and Poor, and to guarantee

[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:58.520]
that a worker gets a fair return for his labor, a country where unions are given essential

[02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.100]
protections.

[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:03.100]
We want an America where the right to education, quality, housing, and healthcare are

[02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:06.560]
established principles, where all people have equal opportunity and financial means to

[02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:09.240]
achieve their potential from lower grades to graduate schools.

[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:12.740]
We want an America where low drug costs and medical treatment through the senior years

[02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:13.560]
are available to all.

[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.000]
We want an America where gender equality is guaranteed, where sexual affiliation conduct

[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.720]
and marital status are a matter of personal privilege, where the home is inviable from

[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:22.560]
illegal trespass.

[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:26.620]
We want an America where taxes are applied fairly to corporations as well as individuals,

[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:30.600]
where tax loopholes are eliminated, where government contracts are awarded according to high

[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:34.540]
ethical standards, and business banking and other institutions are regulated to ensure

[02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:35.400]
the public's protection.

[02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:39.620]
We want an America where the environment is secured for future generations, and the nation

[02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:43.480]
is safeguarded from pollution, where national parks are enlarged and treasured.

[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:48.120]
We want an America where libraries are well-funded, and meeting materials cannot be censored, where

[02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:51.020]
literacy is guaranteed, and computer literacy must be available to all.

[02:05:51.020 --> 02:05:55.020]
We want an America where the civil liberties of every individual are guaranteed by law,

[02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:58.780]
where the electoral process ensures the vote of every citizen, where the government should work

[02:05:58.780 --> 02:06:02.040]
within the framework of the UN, and where the government's intrusion into the affairs of

[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:04.720]
other nations shall be prohibited without due congressional debate and approval.

[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:08.600]
We therefore committed to the principle that governments derived their powers,

[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:12.060]
their just powers, and the consent of the governed pledged to make this declaration for

[02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:16.240]
the future of America a reality, sponsored by ARM New York.

[02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:18.940]
Like it?

[02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:19.820]
I have a tear.

[02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:23.540]
I'll say that maybe Bonerbaugh put it on our website and not a very good copy.

[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:24.940]
It doesn't have a, I will find it somewhere.

[02:06:26.140 --> 02:06:26.660]
Got it?

[02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:28.360]
Thanks Robert and plantation pretty good.

[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:29.580]
Pretty good.

[02:06:30.460 --> 02:06:34.240]
5, 6, 7, we got a lot of open lines here, like almost all of them on a screenless Thursday.

[02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:37.520]
Squeezing, pleading, begging, could joling.

[02:06:37.900 --> 02:06:38.540]
Can't be bother.

[02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:39.740]
Have we had one woman today?

[02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:39.980]
No.

[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:42.580]
On a screenless Shmooson Thursday, no women want to Shmoos.

[02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:43.720]
Even with free tickets?

[02:06:44.060 --> 02:06:46.480]
Even with free tickets for last night's Met Smarling game.

[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:47.220]
I can't believe it.

[02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:48.240]
I got a fistful right here.

[02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:49.740]
A small fistful.

[02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:55.460]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on a AT&T of Horizon Wireless Line.

[02:06:55.580 --> 02:06:57.120]
It is just draining man.

[02:06:57.320 --> 02:06:57.760]
Absolutely.

[02:06:58.380 --> 02:06:59.300]
WD-Q-A-M.

[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:00.840]
You reading that comic crap?

[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:02.100]
Yeah, comic crap.

[02:07:02.220 --> 02:07:02.780]
Yeah, comic crap.

[02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:06.160]
Take the firecracker out of your ass pouts about to go off.

[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:07.500]
WD-Q-A-M.

[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:08.640]
Kill.

[02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:09.280]
Yes sir.

[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:11.640]
Please retire.

[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:12.960]
Oh please, retire.

[02:07:13.300 --> 02:07:14.620]
Took him three and a half hours today.

[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:16.080]
No thanks.

[02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:17.880]
WD-Q-A-M.

[02:07:19.940 --> 02:07:20.780]
Q-A-M.

[02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:22.140]
Oh well, me.

[02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:24.740]
You'll see this is the substitute for having anything to say again.

[02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:26.220]
Here come all the jack offs out again.

[02:07:26.260 --> 02:07:27.420]
No, it's not a jack.

[02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:28.280]
I'm not talking about you.

[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:29.680]
I'm talking about the last pair.

[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:30.780]
I'm not really sure.

[02:07:30.940 --> 02:07:31.500]
I have a husband on you.

[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:32.580]
Hey, welcome back.

[02:07:32.780 --> 02:07:35.400]
I really enjoyed your shows this week.

[02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:38.660]
The website is looking killer.

[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:41.220]
I love all the pictures.

[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:44.060]
And I didn't realize how close guilty and more really were.

[02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:44.520]
You're tight.

[02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:45.940]
You're really tight.

[02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:48.160]
And you know, you had a previous caller that said,

[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.740]
put them in the hot couples contest.

[02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:50.700]
You could do that.

[02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:53.500]
They'd win and then just give them a one-way ticket to the Bahamas.

[02:07:53.660 --> 02:07:54.160]
That's a thought.

[02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:55.400]
That is a thought.

[02:07:55.980 --> 02:07:57.320]
Hey, um.

[02:07:57.940 --> 02:07:58.300]
Absolutely.

[02:07:59.160 --> 02:07:59.780]
That's absolutely.

[02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:04.440]
You know what you read about that priest that just resigned the guy that hit and killed that

[02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:07.580]
that guy walking across the street.

[02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:11.660]
You know, that's what it took for this man to resign.

[02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:17.920]
Not all of the cover-ups and the shuffling around of the pedophile priests

[02:08:18.540 --> 02:08:21.080]
that caused all of those atrocities against people.

[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:22.500]
That didn't get on his conscience.

[02:08:22.500 --> 02:08:26.480]
But the fact that he killed an individual while he says,

[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:28.260]
well, then maybe I should resign.

[02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:29.520]
And I just, you know,

[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.200]
you know, you know, you had nothing to do with conscience.

[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:33.220]
It had to do with pressure.

[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:34.840]
It had absolutely nothing to do with conscience.

[02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:35.880]
But he had me.

[02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:38.400]
He had a lot of pressure to resign.

[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:39.940]
Even though most Catholics,

[02:08:39.940 --> 02:08:44.900]
he had a lot of pressure to resign because of all of the shell game that he played with these kids.

[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:47.720]
Yeah, but after you kill somebody in broad daylight,

[02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:50.220]
then the pressure gets a little bit over the top.

[02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:50.720]
Right.

[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:52.860]
Hey, I got a small confession to make.

[02:08:53.220 --> 02:08:58.940]
I did vote twice on your hot couples' contests for Frank and Liz because her hooters,

[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:01.000]
which is so big, I had to give them each one vote.

[02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:02.360]
Okay, well, that's the limit.

[02:09:02.460 --> 02:09:03.020]
One for Hooter.

[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:05.100]
And Neil, I love you.

[02:09:05.340 --> 02:09:07.160]
And you have a wonderful summer.

[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:10.200]
And I will listen to at least QAM two days a week.

[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:11.180]
Okay, thanks.

[02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:11.880]
Thank you.

[02:09:11.900 --> 02:09:12.540]
I don't like you, George.

[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:14.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 16.

[02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:15.500]
Why don't you retire, George?

[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:17.160]
I don't have 5, 60.

[02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:20.940]
On the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:23.200]
WDQAM.

[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:24.660]
Hey, Neil.

[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:25.240]
Yes, sir.

[02:09:25.780 --> 02:09:29.240]
Did you ever see Mo Howard David and Jackie, what's his name in the same room?

[02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:30.760]
Jackie, what's his name?

[02:09:30.860 --> 02:09:32.100]
Good, excellent job, pal.

[02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:32.880]
You ever see him in Jackie?

[02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:33.940]
What's his name on Asus?

[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:36.400]
Jackie Mason?

[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:37.340]
Jackie, tell me something.

[02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:38.640]
I've always talked about Jackie Johnson now.

[02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:39.840]
I saw her this morning.

[02:09:39.860 --> 02:09:40.240]
You know something?

[02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:43.040]
I don't want to get in with all you head-or-rows, you know.

[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:46.320]
But she, her face, ain't that great.

[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:47.020]
I like it.

[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:48.360]
No, no, it's not that great.

[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:48.960]
Okay.

[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:50.060]
No, she's not beautiful.

[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:50.720]
She's beautiful.

[02:09:50.780 --> 02:09:51.420]
No, she is not.

[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:54.320]
Unless she had an off day or something,

[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:57.160]
unless that maybe her facial parts had been moved around.

[02:09:57.460 --> 02:10:00.060]
I hear everybody on the station just oogling and carrying on.

[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:02.180]
And this morning, I, you know, flip around.

[02:10:02.260 --> 02:10:03.580]
I was watching Channel 7 for Bitten.

[02:10:03.660 --> 02:10:05.460]
She was getting ready to do a Jackie's Johnson.

[02:10:05.460 --> 02:10:06.600]
Do her what the thing.

[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:09.960]
And, uh, I don't know.

[02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:10.960]
In fact, some of the news stories,

[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:12.880]
that saw a lot more beautiful looking brods in her.

[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:14.880]
I mean, not even close.

[02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:15.560]
No contest.

[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:18.020]
I've actually that 10-year-old babe that,

[02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:21.840]
Venerable was pumping on last night in the pool.

[02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:23.540]
I bet she was even, huh?

[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:24.940]
How old is she about eight?

[02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:27.360]
She was afterwards.

[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:29.980]
She got what?

[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:34.400]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, not in the pool.

[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:36.680]
I mean, she's literally knows the kind of stuff

[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:38.220]
that's swimming around in that pool.

[02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:40.040]
Oh, God, almighty.

[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:43.860]
Keep your tongue in your mouth in the pool, Venerable.

[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:47.220]
Oh, and you wonder why he's puking his guts out

[02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:48.720]
and crapping up a storm and going nuts?

[02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:50.060]
You wonder, huh?

[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:53.200]
I don't.

[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:55.600]
19 to 1 at 5, 60, WQM.

[02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:57.100]
I'm going to retire after I do this spot.

[02:10:57.280 --> 02:10:57.760]
Well, maybe not.

[02:10:57.900 --> 02:10:58.620]
I'll think about it.

[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:01.340]
You know, summertime and south Florida guarantees three things.

[02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:02.380]
Heat humidity in hurricanes.

[02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:04.060]
You know, you can't control the weather.

[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:06.640]
But you can control how you protect your home

[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:07.700]
during hurricane season.

[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.600]
The hurricane Shutter and Window Shop

[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:11.160]
provides the best hurricane protection.

[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:13.600]
With just one call to the hurricane Shutter and Window Shop,

[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:14.720]
they'll be at your home the next day.

[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:17.180]
With a quote for hurricane Shutter's Windows and Doors,

Be sure and tell them that old Neil and Horny Adam told you to call.

[02:11:55.800 --> 02:11:59.940]
My life and local, this is 43560.

[02:12:00.580 --> 02:12:01.700]
You way, you way.

[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:08.240]
From the people who've run out of ideas like America's most talented team,

[02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:11.040]
American Idol Junior and America's most talented kid,

[02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:13.280]
comes the ultimate competition for young people.

[02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:14.900]
America's most talented.

[02:12:15.340 --> 02:12:19.480]
Be this the show that lets you vote for your favorite celebrities at your sonogram.

[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:23.800]
The year tonight when a pre-nabel Bruce Springsteen votes out unborn in the USA,

[02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:27.320]
a tidy Justin Timberlake Gurgles rock your body from the inside.

[02:12:27.540 --> 02:12:29.500]
And the things that will grow up to be von Jovey sings

[02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:32.680]
born to be your baby, America's most talented piece.

[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:35.380]
Right after American infant Idol, tonight on Fox.

[02:12:35.620 --> 02:12:37.600]
There's the new issue of American Conservative magazine

[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:40.840]
and the front page article Big Headline, Iraq, the mess we made.

[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:44.380]
Every issue of the American Conservative magazine

[02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:48.200]
shouting from the rooftops about what a nightmare this is,

[02:12:48.300 --> 02:12:50.520]
and it is, and there's people dying there every day, including ours.

[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:54.100]
But hey, don't confuse us with the facts, man, because, uh, you know,

[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:55.580]
hey, thank you for that cheap gas.

[02:12:55.940 --> 02:12:57.220]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, remember that call?

[02:12:57.820 --> 02:12:58.960]
Right, it's, it's Freeno.

[02:12:59.120 --> 02:12:59.640]
Yeah, it's free.

[02:12:59.900 --> 02:13:00.980]
In fact, he's pumping it.

[02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:03.220]
If you go to the gas station, GW will pump you.

[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:05.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:06.960]
We had one woman yet today.

[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:07.660]
Not a woman.

[02:13:09.420 --> 02:13:12.600]
I'm embarrassed to say that Benerboy had more women in the last 24 hours

[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:13.860]
than we've had on issue all day today.

[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:15.560]
That is sad.

[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:16.240]
That's tragic.

[02:13:16.420 --> 02:13:18.180]
In fact, clericists had just as many.

[02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:20.340]
None.

[02:13:21.420 --> 02:13:22.600]
Just as many as we've had.

[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:22.940]
None.

[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:25.140]
Not one.

[02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:27.860]
5, 6, 7, talk about not caring enough to send you very best,

[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.080]
talking about being heartless and playing hard to get.

[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:31.980]
We'd even give them four of those tickets.

[02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:32.400]
I give you.

[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:34.840]
In fact, just to show what a kindhearted guy I am,

[02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:37.040]
what I'm doing right now is I'm changing

[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:39.480]
because there won't be anybody in the seats anyway tonight.

[02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:42.780]
So what I'm doing is I'm changing the day and the date on the ticket.

[02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:45.120]
I'm just writing it in with a pen through the party.

[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:46.900]
Thursday the 19th.

[02:13:46.940 --> 02:13:48.540]
And I'm going to just and see if they work.

[02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:50.580]
Huh?

[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:52.320]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:52.540]
Yeah.

[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:53.900]
See if they work.

[02:13:54.060 --> 02:13:55.140]
They might not notice the difference.

[02:13:57.660 --> 02:13:58.980]
I don't know what you're laughing about.

[02:13:58.980 --> 02:14:00.180]
This could be a whole new scam.

[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:02.900]
We can give away like 30,000 tickets a game.

[02:14:03.060 --> 02:14:04.420]
Although it would be for like previous games.

[02:14:04.420 --> 02:14:05.840]
We'll just we'll just cross it out.

[02:14:05.860 --> 02:14:06.400]
They'll let you in.

[02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:08.220]
Do you still have that traffic ticket?

[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:09.120]
No.

[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:09.840]
I would take that there.

[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:10.480]
See if that works.

[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:11.360]
No problem.

[02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:13.000]
You got a Broward driver's license.

[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:14.660]
They'll let you in like at the Panther Games.

[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:17.020]
By the way, we don't want no Valerie Burray.

[02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:18.440]
Okay, enough of that crap already.

[02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:20.040]
And there's Robert Gryper saying,

[02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:21.600]
well, they got to pay him anyway.

[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:23.540]
So they figured they might as well get something out of them.

[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:24.380]
They got to pay his salary.

[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:25.180]
Guess what?

[02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:26.960]
He couldn't he couldn't score an empty net.

[02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:28.220]
Okay, from five feet away.

[02:14:28.780 --> 02:14:29.580]
Valerie Burray.

[02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:31.960]
Never count on a guy named Valerie to win you nothing.

[02:14:33.020 --> 02:14:34.820]
Unless the monkeys got something to do with it.

[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:36.200]
But that's all?

[02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:37.100]
No.

[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:38.620]
Valerie by the monkeys?

[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:40.020]
No, homophobars.

[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:41.320]
No.

[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:41.800]
Okay.

[02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:43.360]
I know a few bars.

[02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:45.120]
Not your kind.

[02:14:45.580 --> 02:14:46.320]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:47.560]
I'm a woman.

[02:14:47.660 --> 02:14:48.300]
I'll take the tickets.

[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:51.200]
Are you pardon?

[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:52.960]
Say that again.

[02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:54.260]
I know women.

[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:57.140]
Neal's complaining that no women have called.

[02:14:57.140 --> 02:14:58.440]
You'll take what tickets?

[02:14:58.760 --> 02:14:59.920]
The tickets you're talking about.

[02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:01.100]
For last night's game?

[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:02.820]
Oh, you said the 19th.

[02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:03.860]
That's yesterday, you're right.

[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:07.000]
Yeah.

[02:15:07.460 --> 02:15:08.620]
I just turned the radio on.

[02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:09.820]
So I'm a little out of the booth.

[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:10.620]
You're a little bit confused.

[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:11.340]
That's okay.

[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:11.900]
We're all confused.

[02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:12.760]
Okay, thanks.

[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:13.700]
So you got your woman collar.

[02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:14.460]
Thanks.

[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:18.200]
Oh, we got our woman collar, all right.

[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:21.220]
I'll take the tickets.

[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:22.060]
We got our weener.

[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:22.820]
I'm a woman.

[02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:24.280]
I'll take the tickets.

[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:25.820]
How about a nice slap?

[02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:27.780]
Right off the side of the head.

[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:29.380]
Just like just like what's your name?

[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:30.040]
Eve keeps doing

[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:32.800]
to Liz on the past.

[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:33.460]
I love that.

[02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:35.900]
You bitch and she just slapped her off the side of the head.

[02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:36.300]
That's great.

[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:38.540]
It's one of the few shows on TV

[02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:39.600]
where they keep calling to their

[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:41.540]
bitch and slut in a whore like over and over again.

[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:41.920]
I love it.

[02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:42.540]
Excellent.

[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:43.260]
You bitch.

[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:43.860]
You slut.

[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:44.440]
You whore.

[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:45.480]
I love it.

[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:48.180]
In fact, don't we have what's that thing we got?

[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:49.260]
What is it called?

[02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:49.740]
You bitch.

[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:50.500]
Is it?

[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:51.460]
Oh, it's called.

[02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:51.940]
You bitch.

[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:52.940]
You slut.

[02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:53.800]
You whore.

[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:54.220]
Perfect.

[02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:55.740]
I don't mean for this last lady.

[02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:57.720]
She might be nice, but you could fool me.

[02:15:58.680 --> 02:15:59.440]
She'll take the tickets.

[02:15:59.580 --> 02:16:00.780]
And by the way, today is the 19th.

[02:16:00.780 --> 02:16:02.100]
Honey, what I said, well, she didn't get it.

[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:02.800]
She just tuned in.

[02:16:03.420 --> 02:16:04.620]
Anybody believe she just tuned in?

[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:04.780]
No.

[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:05.740]
She heard free tickets.

[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:06.420]
I'll take them.

[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:09.860]
I'm talking about a lady who has something to say.

[02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:12.340]
A lady who wants to speak to a big radio celebrity

[02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:14.640]
who gets driven up to the station in the limousine

[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:16.520]
every day, coined the moharry, David it, or at least should.

[02:16:17.980 --> 02:16:18.800]
A big hotshot.

[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:21.840]
A big fat old turdberg, I mean, in yours truly.

[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:22.800]
That's what we're looking for.

[02:16:22.940 --> 02:16:24.780]
Not somebody who wants something for a free.

[02:16:24.780 --> 02:16:27.060]
This town needs a goddamn lobotomy.

[02:16:27.580 --> 02:16:28.980]
Needs to take the cure.

[02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:30.720]
You got the idea.

[02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:33.580]
As a matter of fact, the face price on this ticket is,

[02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:34.620]
what is the price?

[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:35.660]
A dollar.

[02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:38.540]
I'm serious.

[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:40.180]
I'm serious.

[02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:41.640]
These are one dollar tickets.

[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:43.420]
Those might be our special

[02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:44.200]
emotional.

[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:44.480]
Right.

[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:46.460]
I'll feel reserved, which means nosebleed.

[02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:48.760]
They're a dollar, a holler.

[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:51.940]
I never heard of such a thing, including all tickets.

[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:52.540]
All tickets.

[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:54.660]
All tickets.

[02:16:54.660 --> 02:16:54.660]

[02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:55.480]
Does that pay for the printing?

[02:16:56.700 --> 02:16:59.300]
So when you take away the taxes and the printing,

[02:16:59.500 --> 02:17:02.440]
how many cents do you think the cost of the ticket really is?

[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:03.420]
About third, man.

[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:05.580]
And still I can get him away.

[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:07.180]
We can't.

[02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:08.580]
For free.

[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:11.480]
If we gave you 30 cents, would you take the tickets to the nice game?

[02:17:11.660 --> 02:17:11.780]
No.

[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:13.020]
If we gave you a dollar.

[02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:13.260]
No.

[02:17:13.540 --> 02:17:14.360]
If we drove you to the game.

[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:18.180]
If we picked you up in a limo and we had clearance in a vaccine

[02:17:18.180 --> 02:17:20.240]
giving you a head, you still wouldn't know.

[02:17:21.740 --> 02:17:22.960]
Oh my God.

[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:24.420]
It's very, very sad.

[02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:25.480]
So I don't take it personally.

[02:17:25.860 --> 02:17:27.920]
I'm not the only one that's having a tough time in this town.

[02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:29.680]
WQAM.

[02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:31.220]
Good morning.

[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:31.840]
Yes, sir.

[02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:32.740]
Neil.

[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:33.560]
Yes, I am.

[02:17:33.900 --> 02:17:35.260]
I'm just getting the dial here.

[02:17:36.020 --> 02:17:37.480]
And for the first time I'm listening.

[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:41.180]
Are you usually carrying on like this with your program?

[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:43.000]
What would mean carrying on with your phone?

[02:17:43.260 --> 02:17:44.380]
It was very disrespectful to me.

[02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:47.000]
How could I be disrespectful to you?

[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:47.600]
I just said hello.

[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:50.140]
You're using those words and...

[02:17:50.700 --> 02:17:51.340]
Those kids?

[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:52.760]
Those kids.

[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:53.760]
Kids.

[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:54.720]
Kids.

[02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:56.480]
Are you deaf, sir?

[02:17:56.860 --> 02:17:57.460]
No, I'm not.

[02:17:57.580 --> 02:17:58.660]
Can you speak the language, sir?

[02:17:58.740 --> 02:17:59.220]
Is that the problem?

[02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:00.620]
I hear very, very well.

[02:18:01.340 --> 02:18:01.640]
OK.

[02:18:01.980 --> 02:18:03.220]
So what if I could...

[02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:05.420]
So what do you talk to people in other countries anyway?

[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:06.860]
Sir, let me say this to you.

[02:18:06.980 --> 02:18:07.060]
OK.

[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:08.080]
You don't like the show?

[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:08.600]
Is that what you're saying?

[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.320]
No, I don't like the way you...

[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:11.820]
No, no, no.

[02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:15.420]
But you don't like the program.

[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:16.520]
Is that what you're trying to say, sir?

[02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:16.820]
I don't like it.

[02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:18.320]
I'm inviting everybody to do now.

[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:18.660]
OK.

[02:18:18.860 --> 02:18:19.140]
Bye-bye.

[02:18:19.140 --> 02:18:19.620]
I'm good day.

[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:19.920]
Bye-bye.

[02:18:20.220 --> 02:18:21.880]
He's inviting everybody to tune out.

[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:22.340]
Hi-bye.

[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:23.780]
We're going to tune out right now.

[02:18:23.900 --> 02:18:24.420]
See you all.

[02:18:24.620 --> 02:18:26.980]
He's inviting everybody to tune out,

[02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:28.300]
because he doesn't like it.

[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:30.600]
I don't like vanilla ice cream, so I'm

[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:32.340]
inviting all of you people to throw it out.

[02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:33.620]
When did that throw it out?

[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:35.200]
I can feel them tuning out.

[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:35.520]
Oh.

[02:18:36.140 --> 02:18:36.960]
Can you hear the notes?

[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:38.820]
You can hear the knobs, man.

[02:18:40.380 --> 02:18:41.320]
All over town.

[02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:41.860]
Look at that.

[02:18:42.220 --> 02:18:42.840]
It's an Exodus.

[02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:44.900]
They're all heading for Navhill Road.

[02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:46.260]
They're twisting their knobs.

[02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:49.160]
Because I invite everyone to now.

[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:53.840]
Sir, you are a major, major asshole, OK?

[02:18:54.300 --> 02:18:55.360]
We're majoring this for a big time.

[02:18:55.500 --> 02:18:56.140]
We have a big game.

[02:18:56.500 --> 02:18:58.120]
No, I'm giving him what he deserves.

[02:18:58.680 --> 02:18:59.140]
Major ass.

[02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:01.360]
And he talks with that stentorian voice.

[02:19:01.620 --> 02:19:02.020]
And who do you?

[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:03.220]
I'm doing a radio show, kids.

[02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:03.920]
Entertainment show.

[02:19:03.980 --> 02:19:04.480]
You like it, fine.

[02:19:04.580 --> 02:19:05.540]
If not, put it off.

[02:19:06.260 --> 02:19:06.580]
Schmuck.

[02:19:07.060 --> 02:19:08.340]
I guess I don't have radio like this in Jamaica.

[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:10.080]
It wasn't Jamaican.

[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:11.500]
It was a Caribbean something.

[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:12.220]
How do you know?

[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:13.240]
Oh, come on.

[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:14.880]
Here you go, making stereotypes again.

[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:16.160]
Maybe he was like from a flushing.

[02:19:16.980 --> 02:19:20.460]
If not, he should be himself right down the turlid.

[02:19:20.860 --> 02:19:21.260]
WDQAM.

[02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:23.220]
Send that guy to my Hogini card.

[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:23.680]
Right.

[02:19:25.580 --> 02:19:27.260]
Sentiment of Duda is with Johnny Dirk.

[02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:27.660]
Damn.

[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:29.320]
WDQAM.

[02:19:30.380 --> 02:19:30.780]
Amazing.

[02:19:31.140 --> 02:19:31.900]
It is amazing.

[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:32.460]
Fuck yourself.

[02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:35.920]
560560.

[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:38.100]
Power 560 on the 80.

[02:19:38.100 --> 02:19:39.060]
No, he actually hates me.

[02:19:39.700 --> 02:19:40.100]
I beg your pardon?

[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:42.080]
Caffeine-free soda in the soda machine.

[02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:43.280]
I like him.

[02:19:43.420 --> 02:19:43.980]
That's what I drink.

[02:19:43.980 --> 02:19:45.140]
I want caffeine.

[02:19:45.340 --> 02:19:46.240]
Are you neat caffeine?

[02:19:46.380 --> 02:19:46.660]
I need it.

[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:48.460]
I think the last guy needs some caffeine too.

[02:19:48.900 --> 02:19:49.640]
Right up his...

[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:49.960]
Back down.

[02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:50.860]
We're working on it, Paulo.

[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:54.340]
In fact, Clara is going to take that little injected tube and bring it right to your

[02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:54.540]
home.

[02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:57.440]
And then he's going to...

[02:19:57.440 --> 02:19:58.040]
The Lube tube.

[02:19:58.380 --> 02:19:58.940]
The Lube tube.

[02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:00.080]
WDQAM.

[02:20:00.780 --> 02:20:01.140]
NEO.

[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:01.580]
Yes.

[02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:05.740]
Hey, I'm calling because I'm embarrassed to be a chick in this tent.

[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:06.540]
I don't blame you.

[02:20:06.580 --> 02:20:07.100]
You should be.

[02:20:07.460 --> 02:20:08.460]
I love you.

[02:20:08.620 --> 02:20:10.580]
I would never scrub tickets off you.

[02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:12.660]
I just wanted to tell you that not every...

[02:20:12.660 --> 02:20:15.320]
I mean, everybody was overreasoned as a dirtbag.

[02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:15.960]
Amen.

[02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:17.180]
All right, I love you.

[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:18.160]
And some of the women too.

[02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:19.300]
Thanks.

[02:20:19.460 --> 02:20:19.740]
Bye-bye.

[02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:20.100]
Bye-bye.

[02:20:20.200 --> 02:20:21.440]
There's our first real lady.

[02:20:21.660 --> 02:20:22.820]
She didn't want no tickets.

[02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:24.120]
She wasn't a free loader.

[02:20:24.300 --> 02:20:27.500]
She wasn't taking a bunch of cheap shots, making a bunch of stupid ass comments.

[02:20:27.740 --> 02:20:29.080]
She was just a person, you know?

[02:20:29.780 --> 02:20:32.520]
And she's really embarrassed to be a chick in this town and she ought to be.

[02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:33.940]
A chick in the town.

[02:20:33.940 --> 02:20:34.560]
A chick in this town.

[02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:37.480]
Oh, I got to tell you when Moe is on there and talking about...

[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:40.840]
Hey, you know, when Ferrell comes in when he begs him to come in with him?

[02:20:40.940 --> 02:20:41.420]
No, I don't know.

[02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:44.400]
Yeah, Moe begs Ferrell to come in there because we would be great together.

[02:20:44.580 --> 02:20:47.160]
You know when we get Kelly out of here and you and I can do the short-against.

[02:20:47.160 --> 02:20:48.600]
Yeah, he's trying to cover his ass.

[02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:49.480]
What?

[02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:50.700]
Uh, that's right.

[02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:52.160]
Go on.

[02:20:54.520 --> 02:20:58.440]
Now I lost my train of thought when he...

[02:20:58.440 --> 02:20:59.500]
No invites Ferrell in for crossover.

[02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:00.820]
Yeah.

[02:21:05.180 --> 02:21:06.600]
Because they'd be so good together.

[02:21:07.340 --> 02:21:08.720]
No, I had something really important.

[02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:09.920]
Oh, no, I know what it was.

[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:13.040]
And of course Ferrell is going out about my other favorite to game in my...

[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:14.980]
My chick, my home is, you know, so hot.

[02:21:15.580 --> 02:21:18.160]
And then Moe is talking about the pictures.

[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:21.040]
I guess maybe Vlad and Anthony left some pictures from the dual-mark show.

[02:21:21.960 --> 02:21:23.600]
Oh, yeah, she's really a hot chick.

[02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:24.500]
That one is a hot chick.

[02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:25.260]
And this one over here.

[02:21:25.420 --> 02:21:26.620]
She's really... that chick is really...

[02:21:26.620 --> 02:21:27.920]
He doesn't talk about racks, does he?

[02:21:28.340 --> 02:21:29.920]
No, I haven't heard him talk about racks, but...

[02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:31.360]
Oh, racks.

[02:21:33.140 --> 02:21:33.660]
Racks spread.

[02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:37.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, you got a hostile crowd out there today.

[02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:39.640]
They're really... and you know something I understand.

[02:21:40.060 --> 02:21:40.720]
I understand.

[02:21:40.940 --> 02:21:42.880]
You're stuck here, you haven't got two nickels to rub together.

[02:21:43.100 --> 02:21:44.300]
It's 100 degrees in the shade.

[02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:46.320]
The mosquitoes are the size of God then come quads.

[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:48.400]
And it's just not a very pleasant situation.

[02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:51.040]
So I understand why you're miserable and hostile and hateful.

[02:21:52.360 --> 02:21:52.960]
Who do you, QAM?

[02:21:55.620 --> 02:21:55.980]
QAM?

[02:21:56.680 --> 02:21:57.240]
Hello, Neil.

[02:21:57.460 --> 02:21:57.860]
Yes, sir.

[02:21:58.360 --> 02:21:59.080]
How are you, sir?

[02:21:59.220 --> 02:22:00.300]
I'm doing very well. Thank you.

[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:01.620]
You know, it does...

[02:22:01.620 --> 02:22:03.340]
That jacket, as I call it, is a little wallet.

[02:22:03.500 --> 02:22:03.820]
It does.

[02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:06.140]
These things that perhaps there are some of us that listen to you

[02:22:06.140 --> 02:22:07.440]
because you're so disrespectful.

[02:22:07.900 --> 02:22:08.520]
That's right.

[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:11.820]
Who says I have to respect him, his ass?

[02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:12.440]
Exactly.

[02:22:12.780 --> 02:22:14.780]
The people who deserve to be disrespectful, get disrespectful.

[02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:15.860]
It is what it is.

[02:22:16.120 --> 02:22:18.040]
I'm inviting everybody to do not mind.

[02:22:18.300 --> 02:22:18.440]
Yeah.

[02:22:18.900 --> 02:22:19.840]
Toon into this ass.

[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:20.440]
Right.

[02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:21.240]
Toon into this ass.

[02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:22.520]
All right. In fact, that's what he did.

[02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:23.280]
Okay, have a great day.

[02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:23.860]
I love your meal.

[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:24.340]
Well said.

[02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:26.160]
See, there you go.

[02:22:26.440 --> 02:22:27.720]
He's not pissed off and fired up.

[02:22:27.860 --> 02:22:28.720]
There's a happy camper.

[02:22:29.480 --> 02:22:31.420]
He's probably getting out of here in a couple of weeks this guy.

[02:22:31.780 --> 02:22:32.700]
That's why he's in such a good mood.

[02:22:33.660 --> 02:22:35.840]
Do you think that was a Jamaican man that was called before?

[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:35.900]
He was a little bit more.

[02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:36.620]
He was just a little bit more.

[02:22:36.620 --> 02:22:36.620]

[02:22:36.620 --> 02:22:37.120]
You know what?

[02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:38.140]
You worked at the Bahamas all the time.

[02:22:38.300 --> 02:22:38.860]
Speaking by.

[02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:39.440]
Speaking.

[02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:41.400]
Speaking about condos.

[02:22:41.460 --> 02:22:41.700]
Anybody.

[02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:43.840]
Oh my God.

[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:46.180]
I guess I'm not good enough for you, Munt.

[02:22:46.420 --> 02:22:47.340]
That's the problem, Munt.

[02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:48.740]
He could have been 28-year-old.

[02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:49.680]
I don't, he's an-

[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:50.940]
You know something, no matter where he's from,

[02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:52.140]
he's still just an asshole to me.

[02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:53.260]
He sounded a little like Alc mentioned.

[02:22:53.540 --> 02:22:54.860]
Just another asshole to me.

[02:22:56.500 --> 02:22:58.660]
Look for the QM van for another four minutes.

[02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:00.020]
Well, I'm sorry.

[02:23:00.300 --> 02:23:01.000]
I apologize to Miguel.

[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.180]
I was going to do this at 12.30.

[02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:03.060]
He's out of there.

[02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:03.440]
Don't let her.

[02:23:03.940 --> 02:23:10.100]
But he doesn't care as long as we get the air checks. Oh, okay. This is long as we get the air checks that I give him the plug because we know nobody wants

[02:23:10.100 --> 02:23:12.800]
those Marlon to I mean I'll take the tickets

[02:23:16.620 --> 02:23:17.520]
Got a fireplace

[02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:27.200]
I wonder how long it takes to burn Marlon tickets in the microwave we have a microwave we have to know I'm I'm you think I'm gonna

[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:33.640]
What's up my microwave with the paper we'll put a plate down now way no way Jose a paper play no way or hey

[02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:35.860]
I'm not messing up that very nice micro. Thanks again

[02:23:35.860 --> 02:23:38.520]
I'm a good friend Bob for bringing every refrigerator many years ago, right?

[02:23:39.080 --> 02:23:44.620]
The microwave I don't remember where did that come from another listener another list of weight-unner who was and I had the espresso machine like wise

[02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:51.280]
Right all of the stuff in here we got contributed or I paid for it or whatever because it's the beesleys or as cheap as goddamn dirt

[02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:56.040]
That's why I bought the book which is my book of Brian and getting paid for his bits lately on time by them

[02:23:56.720 --> 02:24:01.760]
Yeah, now the clearance is back I guarantee you once we can separate him in the beast. He'll straighten those beesleys back

[02:24:11.460 --> 02:24:13.740]
Boy it's the one to two hours

[02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:44.360]
For

[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:45.020]
And

[02:24:45.020 --> 02:24:49.460]
Please do with

[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:56.280]
It's a drag, does you care?

[02:24:57.140 --> 02:25:01.180]
Oh, say, don't let her hear that

[02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:05.460]
You can't then return, Ray

[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:10.960]
For the fact is plain to see

[02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:16.060]
She's your wife, your her slave

[02:25:20.020 --> 02:25:20.420]
Absolutely

[02:25:21.820 --> 02:25:26.060]
102 at 560 WQM, it's our gigantic one and two hours bigger than life itself

[02:25:26.900 --> 02:25:29.200]
Although we are very disrespectful as what I'm hearing

[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:32.580]
And not what you're hearing is not the scuttle barbara building

[02:25:32.580 --> 02:25:34.380]
No matter if I've got a similar call once upon a time

[02:25:34.380 --> 02:25:37.780]
Did you really? You or me? Me?

[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:39.660]
You're disrespectful too?

[02:25:39.980 --> 02:25:40.380]
Absolutely

[02:25:40.380 --> 02:25:41.240]
Well, I'll be goddamn

[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:42.560]
Sort of, the guy said

[02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:43.600]
Yeah, I can 30

[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:47.900]
Hey, listen, a good news for you

[02:25:47.900 --> 02:25:49.800]
During that last break I made a phone call

[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:53.660]
Because clearance and the beast are had such a good time

[02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:55.620]
Since clearance has been back that they're getting hitched

[02:25:55.620 --> 02:25:57.620]
I made a phone call, made reservations in Toronto

[02:25:57.620 --> 02:25:59.380]
They're getting married next week

[02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:00.200]
NTO

[02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:01.920]
Wow, where are they registered?

[02:26:03.180 --> 02:26:04.360]
I'll be giving the number out

[02:26:05.420 --> 02:26:07.460]
What a lovely couple they'll make

[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:09.580]
I can just see them during Pride Week

[02:26:10.380 --> 02:26:14.220]
Driving up and down Bay Street and Tert Street

[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:20.400]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, we got a lot of hostile assholes out there

[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:23.200]
Because they're stuck here and we understand that

[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:25.400]
We appreciate that, don't we? Absolutely

[02:26:26.580 --> 02:26:27.020]
WQM

[02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:30.380]
I've been listening since 1982

[02:26:30.380 --> 02:26:32.440]
You think I'm going to take that guys as right?

[02:26:33.060 --> 02:26:34.120]
Are we sure hope not?

[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:36.100]
The answer would be no

[02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:36.260]
No

[02:26:39.900 --> 02:26:42.780]
The outfield boxes, they're nine bucks a piece

[02:26:42.780 --> 02:26:45.240]
And the seats too at the Marlin Games

[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:45.940]
How do you like that?

[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:47.880]
So those people are always bitching about

[02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:49.800]
This is overpriced and that's overpriced

[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:51.960]
If it's said free on the ticket they still wouldn't be there

[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:55.140]
Well Wednesdays is the buy one get one free

[02:26:55.140 --> 02:26:56.860]
If you have the Sun Sentinel

[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:00.480]
Tuesday if you have the hell that's buy one get one free

[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:03.000]
If you see Miguel you can get free tickets

[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:04.600]
Which is actually where I got my name

[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:05.340]
That's right

[02:27:05.340 --> 02:27:06.200]
Don't laugh

[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.520]
Hey, to go over there in the swimming pool

[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:10.800]
The dinner boy was looking at

[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:13.220]
She wasn't the one with the red streaks in her hair, was she?

[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:16.740]
No, she had red streaks in her pants he said

[02:27:17.860 --> 02:27:19.100]
Okay, is that one with the red streaks in her pants?

[02:27:19.100 --> 02:27:21.480]
Maybe she wasn't old enough to have red streaks in her pants

[02:27:21.480 --> 02:27:22.380]
Have a great day, Pally

[02:27:22.380 --> 02:27:23.660]
See you, man

[02:27:23.660 --> 02:27:26.400]
No, now he says that you were looking at

[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:27.480]
You were just looking at

[02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:29.900]
Now you weren't doing this in the pool

[02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:32.340]
You were committing some sexual act in the pool, were you?

[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:36.400]
All my sexual rumps were at treasure island

[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:38.560]
I didn't even make it to the Moralyns thing

[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:41.480]
That will be tonight for me

[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:46.680]
How come the show is almost over now

[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:48.780]
It's gonna want to clock our in that or discovering this

[02:27:48.780 --> 02:27:50.200]
Because I don't have a microphone in front of me

[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:51.740]
Because George is, you know, Hagen what?

[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:52.580]
Hagen what? Hagen it

[02:27:52.580 --> 02:27:52.780]
Right

[02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:55.160]
Hagen da

[02:27:55.840 --> 02:27:58.020]
But ask me tomorrow about what happens at the Moralyns game

[02:27:58.020 --> 02:27:59.320]
I'll have some stories

[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:02.320]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:03.800]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:04.580]
Haaaaah

[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:05.580]
Man

[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:08.760]
You talk about, see you invented it

[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:11.940]
Dr. Frankenstein you invented it

[02:28:11.940 --> 02:28:13.900]
There's the little monster right there

[02:28:13.900 --> 02:28:14.760]
It's creations

[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:15.920]
That's going to be right

[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:20.120]
And now just like the monster it's out of control

[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:21.900]
Absolutely correct

[02:28:21.900 --> 02:28:22.700]
Ha ha ha

[02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:25.200]
So you got laid at treasure island?

[02:28:26.340 --> 02:28:27.160]
Well, that I mean

[02:28:27.160 --> 02:28:33.020]

[02:44:07.610 --> 02:44:14.190]
and citing like him oh it don't quit being such a war swiria let's see currently it says this

[02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:19.850]
facts there are three specialized lines from hallmark Jewish Hispanic and us darkies I don't

[02:44:19.850 --> 02:44:23.810]
understand the issue with having cards that celebrate individual subcultures the fallacy of the

[02:44:23.810 --> 02:44:28.130]
west is a homogenous group was a racist notion intolerant of cultural expressions beyond those of

[02:44:28.130 --> 02:44:32.790]
western europe you're absolutely wrong about that t r further if there's a market for a specialized

[02:44:32.790 --> 02:44:37.110]
line does not our model of capitalism predict that the niche will be filled I think it's encouraging

[02:44:37.110 --> 02:44:40.910]
that independent groups are actually being serviced by corporate america although I lament the loss

[02:44:40.910 --> 02:44:44.450]
of revenue for all the minority companies who previously filled the void as for the reverse

[02:44:44.450 --> 02:44:48.350]
racism argument that was never lacking cards celebrate same package day for the Irish October

[02:44:48.350 --> 02:44:52.930]
fest for the German April full day for the friends etc I guess it can all be summed up that if the

[02:44:52.930 --> 02:44:57.270]
cards had cross cultural appeal and appearance these specialized lines would fail their successes

[02:44:57.270 --> 02:45:01.350]
a testament to their need your dark skin listener t r north mimics he's got some good points in

[02:45:01.350 --> 02:45:07.230]
there you know it and like I always say who cares here's another all this is also from him and

[02:45:07.230 --> 02:45:15.450]
all this from somebody else I think the since sediment day hallmark year-round product offering

[02:45:16.290 --> 02:45:21.410]
see this is bears out with his other guy was saying cards for traditional occasions like

[02:45:21.410 --> 02:45:26.390]
birthday love wedding anniversary sympathy and more since sedimentary hallmark also addresses his

[02:45:26.390 --> 02:45:34.110]
panic cultural events like uh kinsian air oh kinsian air kinsian air i said it right that time

[02:45:34.110 --> 02:45:39.210]
just look i'm not a professional spick like you okay so i even like a senator to even like a make

[02:45:39.210 --> 02:45:44.930]

[02:45:44.930 --> 02:45:50.590]
of girls 15th birthday in al dia del santo that's the Jose Santos birthday chicken sacrifice

[02:45:51.250 --> 02:45:55.950]
and the line also offers cards for a dia de los reyes celebrated jane were sick the

[02:45:55.950 --> 02:45:59.730]
Hispanic Christian holiday commemorative rival of three wise men and bettlehem unfortunately they

[02:45:59.730 --> 02:46:05.590]

[02:49:32.950 --> 02:49:35.090]

[02:49:35.090 --> 02:49:35.310]
adam

[02:49:37.030 --> 02:49:40.070]
i'm not talking about for else for else fine when i'm messing with him but adam

[02:49:40.070 --> 02:49:44.030]
is out of the back and the reason i mentioned that about pa walker because he's

[02:49:44.030 --> 02:49:45.430]
a lot prettier than jackey johnson

[02:49:45.910 --> 02:49:50.130]
and here's the fact to prove it and i know the problem this fact is an hour the

[02:49:50.130 --> 02:49:52.830]
only people would have balls to say it because she is like she's like the

[02:49:52.830 --> 02:49:54.430]
rascal house of hot babes you know

[02:49:55.130 --> 02:49:57.890]
it's just fashionable to say oh i gotta see the weather

[02:49:57.890 --> 02:50:02.250]
oh there's a high front over my crotch there's jackey you know that car will say

[02:50:02.250 --> 02:50:05.790]
that she doesn't have much of an eye she didn't look good this morning i maybe

[02:50:05.790 --> 02:50:10.130]
was an off day maybe the camera angle was bad maybe uh... they weren't

[02:50:10.130 --> 02:50:13.350]
shooting through the lonely i'm like the fact says you are correct about jackey

[02:50:13.350 --> 02:50:16.530]
johnson monkey face bleached hair and store bought boobs

[02:50:16.530 --> 02:50:21.290]
how do you like that two out of three for example so fear of a garah who's all

[02:50:21.290 --> 02:50:25.170]
all back there i mean is jackey johnson in her league no no no no

[02:50:26.090 --> 02:50:27.930]
so don't tell me i don't know a beautiful one

[02:50:27.930 --> 02:50:30.670]
so she doing the weather you don't know a beautiful woman when you see one

[02:50:32.390 --> 02:50:32.750]
uh...

[02:50:33.330 --> 02:50:33.690]
okay

[02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:38.190]
i mean when you tell me that durin is got a big rack or no that was a

[02:50:38.190 --> 02:50:42.490]
for us and joe costell by the way quit talking about pirate radio you jackass

[02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:47.010]
the hen you were we got a spy report that you guys were promoting but in addition to

[02:50:47.010 --> 02:50:49.850]
which why would you want to go on and promote ninety five point three until

[02:50:49.850 --> 02:50:51.030]
what frequencies are on

[02:50:52.710 --> 02:50:56.290]
at the time we didn't know it was pirate radio we just heard this crazy black

[02:50:56.290 --> 02:51:00.830]
man on the air talking about racist stuff right funny right it was way after the

[02:51:00.830 --> 02:51:05.410]
fact that we find out that it was pirate radio we heard it they're infringing on your career

[02:51:05.410 --> 02:51:09.230]
don't understand that i mean to be able to spend a four well like i said i

[02:51:09.230 --> 02:51:14.290]
spent a fortune to build a studio yeah we know it was pirate time we heard it on like one

[02:51:14.290 --> 02:51:19.030]
of four something it was just a little bit but it was uh... something i have no idea

[02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:23.210]
but uh... bottom line is that once we found out it was pirate radio first of all

[02:51:23.210 --> 02:51:27.030]
disappeared second ball we were vehemently against it those guys are criminals

[02:51:29.490 --> 02:51:33.990]
plus spreading all that racist crap on the air you know but we're not too fond of that here

[02:51:33.990 --> 02:51:39.370]
are we no we hate that don't we absolutely five six out how you and mow getting

[02:51:39.370 --> 02:51:43.390]
along the world we're here it is that there's no crossover between you and mo no mo

[02:51:43.390 --> 02:51:48.570]
can that be true absolutely yeah that's true well what's the reason for that

[02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:52.330]
well he's working on his stuff you know he's got that big five o'clock hour to fill

[02:51:52.330 --> 02:51:57.730]
and and we're usually on a roll you were his only hope huge four o'clock you were his only ally

[02:51:59.550 --> 02:52:02.850]
and now you're you're letting the old man down to you're jumping off the bandwagon

[02:52:02.850 --> 02:52:07.330]
just fine i noticed that i was the least to despise uh... howard on the right what i

[02:52:07.330 --> 02:52:11.490]
think they figure you're like a wimp you're too much of a pussy to tell them the truth that is it

[02:52:11.490 --> 02:52:14.910]
i won't repeat what you said off here okay good not yet

[02:52:15.430 --> 02:52:19.570]
which of these statements is the most ridiculous George W. Bush is a great leader three twenty two

[02:52:19.570 --> 02:52:25.190]
pieces coming in the middle east one sixteen George is a great uh... fill in for neil 105

[02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:30.750]
mo Howard david it is a great show 78 absolutely the marlins of the 91 games 42

[02:52:30.750 --> 02:52:35.850]
clearance our PD will get laid this year twenty three is the most ridiculous statement and

[02:52:35.850 --> 02:52:39.230]
for ral's got a pleasant voice funny don't let me forget what we do the little crossover with

[02:52:39.230 --> 02:52:43.170]
Scott in the morning uh... because you never mind me anyway i'll try to remember

[02:52:44.410 --> 02:52:47.770]
his assignment while i'm gone will be to get

[02:52:48.390 --> 02:52:55.010]
clearance laid right it down is there anybody else in this building who's got a better chance i

[02:52:55.010 --> 02:52:59.670]
mean he's got a good chance i would say to hook him up but hooking him up is that that's not

[02:52:59.670 --> 02:53:02.230]
going to be a piece practically going to have to be like their holding his

[02:53:02.230 --> 02:53:08.330]
glant and you know talking about that's right right it up right it on the window

[02:53:09.250 --> 02:53:11.610]
Scott you got to get clearance laid man

[02:53:13.050 --> 02:53:16.990]
there you are he's written on account to get clearance laid that's got for ral's uh...

[02:53:16.990 --> 02:53:20.110]
if he can get that done then we salute a man that we took the head

[02:53:21.650 --> 02:53:25.330]
now what's uh... what's uh... joe's take on for all

[02:53:26.310 --> 02:53:27.250]
what's your take

[02:53:28.290 --> 02:53:32.470]
i haven't met him yet but he's i love him about personally uh... shows great

[02:53:32.470 --> 02:53:35.630]
but he'll stand still long enough to meet him okay you'll ever really meet him

[02:53:35.730 --> 02:53:40.390]
right now but uh... you know i obviously i haven't heard him too much because of the time

[02:53:40.390 --> 02:53:43.570]
but when i heard him fill in and when we first brought him on he's great

[02:53:43.570 --> 02:53:47.250]
i used to listen back in the day when i was a schlepper oh wait i still am but still

[02:53:48.210 --> 02:53:52.610]
he's funny he's hysterical he's he's outrageous he's any excellent there you

[02:53:52.610 --> 02:53:55.110]
know what you still have the ballpark yet the river bent over the

[02:53:56.510 --> 02:53:58.070]
we heard about that you've been over the what

[02:53:58.070 --> 02:54:01.430]
been over the seats or something they were all giving her dollars he was taking her clothes what

[02:54:01.430 --> 02:54:03.610]
happened do you know why i didn't hear that part

[02:54:03.610 --> 02:54:04.230]
what

[02:54:04.230 --> 02:54:07.910]
of course who was gonna tell us that part because being a boy pretend he was there

[02:54:07.910 --> 02:54:10.270]
meanwhile he was getting late after treasure island so he was there

[02:54:10.270 --> 02:54:13.510]
george mister golden opportunity to be a ballgame for free

[02:54:13.510 --> 02:54:14.910]
all i know is we got

[02:54:14.910 --> 02:54:18.650]
two different colors and that's an enormous amount for you that's like a lot

[02:54:18.650 --> 02:54:22.090]
oh my god are you kidding me that said they were out there with for all and man they

[02:54:22.090 --> 02:54:25.270]
were the strippers and they they were holding up dollars and all going crazy and

[02:54:25.270 --> 02:54:29.070]
they could the ushers came over to the florida marlin's baseball and strip club i like it

[02:54:29.070 --> 02:54:33.270]
i think it's great i was actually gonna think about going there we go

[02:54:33.710 --> 02:54:38.090]
let's hear it get some bastards out there by the way would you like some tickets to give

[02:54:38.090 --> 02:54:44.110]
away in your show tonight for last night's game sure no it's just a mall it's a stress-free ballgame

[02:54:44.110 --> 02:54:47.250]
and ten five minutes you know the final score you know the endings when you have to pay attention

[02:54:47.250 --> 02:54:51.370]
it's great i'll leave you a 15 tickets for last night's game i bet you guys can give them away

[02:54:51.370 --> 02:54:54.970]
but i wait what i started doing was crossing out the date and writing in yes

[02:54:54.970 --> 02:54:59.230]
oh they will notice a difference no uh they'll be just happy to see it yes the rumor around the

[02:54:59.230 --> 02:55:05.850]
building is that uh marlons were too happy with uh with the shenanigans with the shenanigans

[02:55:05.850 --> 02:55:09.230]
well but at least we got next to a couple hundred people out there what they want

[02:55:09.230 --> 02:55:13.290]
and some publicity right right you know we and he we've been talking marlin crap for like a hundred

[02:55:13.290 --> 02:55:17.010]
times more than we ever would because nobody cares about the baseball team who are in last place by

[02:55:17.010 --> 02:55:22.570]
the way but uh there what what's the now don't give us a little tease like that who is is this a

[02:55:22.570 --> 02:55:27.330]
valid rumor is this just uh oh as soon as they see me walking by they they shut off and it's like

[02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:34.710]
who's this day you're talking about i was passing by by the the promotion's office and it was like

[02:55:34.710 --> 02:55:39.250]
five or six people in there well let's have some names uh the ring was in there

[02:55:39.250 --> 02:55:43.390]
there were all phantastarine was in there the ring was that she was in the one talking oh

[02:55:43.390 --> 02:55:49.870]
she was in her own office you got a big rack other people that i'd sort of pick up truck and who else

[02:55:50.870 --> 02:55:53.810]
other people that i didn't know who they were i don't know if maybe they were from the marlins or

[02:55:53.810 --> 02:55:58.570]
something and they were the ones talking amongst themselves really yeah so if we're also only

[02:55:58.570 --> 02:56:03.550]
been here like a couple of weeks and he's already created a whole uh big sondidance that's beautiful

[02:56:03.550 --> 02:56:10.810]
throughout uh we agree nice god Scott that is excellent we like it a few stirs up the crab

[02:56:10.810 --> 02:56:16.250]
instead of this usual state boring crap you know that's a problem in this town they don't realize

[02:56:16.250 --> 02:56:19.250]
people if they're going to pay a couple of bucks or make the effort to go somewhere they want to

[02:56:19.250 --> 02:56:25.030]
have a good time they want to be entertained right they want some excitement uh huh oh and by

[02:56:25.030 --> 02:56:29.710]
the way what's that the dan trail uh willis is that his name dartrail danter remember i saw that

[02:56:29.710 --> 02:56:33.330]
thing on the website the other day i said who's that a basketball player that's that the young

Wayne had the team they want to do the hoki poki now they're doing the huchi kuchi and quite frankly

[02:57:03.370 --> 02:57:09.750]

[02:59:15.050 --> 02:59:20.770]
a slob Joan Osborne went on to describe him as a stranger on the bus trying to make his way home

[02:59:20.770 --> 02:59:27.650]

[02:59:27.650 --> 02:59:32.090]
nothing against people taking public transportation but I can materialize from the love of me

[02:59:32.090 --> 02:59:38.710]
I just wish she checked with me but no Joan Osborne never thought to check with God before she

[02:59:38.710 --> 02:59:44.810]
wrote a song about him and as she tried to explain to inside the behind oh come on it's artistic

[02:59:44.810 --> 03:00:00.010]

that Sammy and right away some other people jumped somebody else started it they were picking on him

[03:01:40.350 --> 03:01:45.290]

caught before this corking happened and they was the best player in baseball and everybody had

[03:01:54.750 --> 03:01:59.390]
loved him admired him were they do it saying that because he was Hispanic and how about payrod

[03:01:59.390 --> 03:02:02.450]
