[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820]
Thanks for the good news. Okay. Okay, so here we go

[00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.320]
We actually had a couple of Panther people today because we don't think that hockey sucks on this show

[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.380]
We think hockey is the greatest sport in the world which we know beyond a shadow of a duck

[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.940]
And it's not against a lot of talk about hockey on this show and

[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.080]
Goldie's go and tomorrow night Ottawa Center is very exciting the best team in league by the way no excuses

[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.520]
Okay, I realized we don't have a lot of front running phonies down here like the red wings do

[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.900]
With Ottawa Jersey's on because they took in a playoffs every year

[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.500]
But they still got a great exciting team with Mirian Hoes job and Daniel Alpherson and the lovely Marty

[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.880]
Have let and Patrick LaLiehm, huh?

[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.960]
What are you looking at me like what would they I huh? You don't know you're out of your bus senators there mister you better get with it

[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.760]
You better get with it you better start becoming a hockey expert that we can put you on a morning show

[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.120]
Which that's your up a little bit get him above that two seven number. Well, that's oh

[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.060]
Man, I mean I realized the whole station got hoes in December but even so you see what I'm saying everything is

[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.200]
I don't mention the the first team

[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.400]
Their numbers by comparison. Are you starting in again? No, I wouldn't I tell you what I tell you mo

[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.460]
Right there he see right and he's gonna have to go back to square one again and try to get your ass part again

[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.600]
Well, that's that's meaning what you would have started made up all those stories about his bad hair pieces and his Veracos paint

[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.120]
Even though they turned out to be true

[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.320]
I don't know about the lime green pants and the checkered pants and the checkered shorts and

[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.040]
These special Christmas party

[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.420]
Wig that you were talking about a great length and the checkered past the purple muskrat

[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.660]
Brad remember the purple muskrat lounge well whatever. I don't know you're the one that started all that crap

[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.140]
Got him all been out of shape now what you said the numbers did the first their first team had much better out of camera call

[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.640]
Any book I looked through the rating books there and I don't see any book where they had like a two seven and man

[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.160]
I mean keeping my this was the fall book the dolphin book

[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.940]
Four and buys I think I've heard you saying this yeah, you're talking about that right

[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.440]
They had the worst I could find and it was a 3.9

[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.280]
That's the worst I can find which was last fall the year ago fall

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.020]
Okay, which is when I got all panicky here and decided I blow up the whole place. There's Greg again for you know

[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.520]
What do I do now? You know scratch the hole in your head see if you can make some more hair fall out

[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.760]
You know how much is here is falling out another week. He'll be look just like Boca Brian

[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.640]
He'll walk in that do you say oh hi, okay? It'll be Greg read

[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.320]
So be careful what you say to him because he's not too crazy about you either

[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:24.800]
Okay, how the pull come out and I still think that that's obnoxious even though George is very weak on here the fact that those numbers are not too bad

[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.240]
You know still kicks everybody else's ass here in the summer

[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.860]
